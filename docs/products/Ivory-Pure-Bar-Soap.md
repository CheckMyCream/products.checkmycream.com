<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> not that much good as i expected!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize it&#x27;s the &amp;#34;aloe&amp;#34; scent version. Because I didn&#x27;t know there was a scented version. If you want plain soap, get the original ivory, not the aloe scent. My bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, it&#x27;s a very mild scent as soaps go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Package looks like the picture - I would say mine seem slightly mussed from handling - like maybe they&#x27;d been in storage for a while...but hey, it&#x27;s a bar of soap, it doesn&#x27;t expire like milk.</li>
    <li> Always used the regular Ivory bars. These ones are nice too, just a hint of aloe.</li>
    <li> Not as good as Dove bars</li>
    <li> I tried this as an alternative to Dove which I have been using for years. I wanted a more affordable option but was not as happy using this. My skin has not been as soft and I have had more breakouts on my body after using this soap for about a month. The one thing that is an improvement is the bars last longer than other brands of soap I have tried. My husband noticed the difference as well and asked we switch back to Dove.</li>
    <li> A must have in all homes if your not allergic to it. The aloe smells great and gentle enough for babies.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Ivory all my life for the lack of artificial scent, now stuck with a bundle of these stinky bars :-(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed, upset and feeling ripped off. I shopped at a smaller grocery and all they had was this for Ivory. I thought, OK, they changed the packaging, whatever... pretty green... yuck! they changed the whole thing. It smells!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any chance I could get a pack of the real thing and be relieved of these stink bombs?&lt;br /&gt;Phew!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll have to look into other options. Turned off by this.</li>
    <li> Bought for a kid&#x27;s craft project- worked great and price was right. No idea how it works as actual soap! The smell is a strong clean scent.</li>
    <li> They have since raised the price on these but when I bought them it was a terrific deal as an ad on!</li>
    <li> great product that leaves your skin feeling smooth and very clean.</li>
    <li> We can&#x27;t the aloe around here everytime we run out so being able to order this is great. It arrived in really good shape and the right size just what I expected and not out of sight on price that is why I got this coming everything two months.</li>
    <li> The first low-to-no perfume stink good quality body/hands/face soap I was able to find in 26 years in this country! Everything is perfumed beyond any reason, intolerable and totally nauseating, as if the manufacturer&#x27;s goal is to make people sick. Not this soap. Light smell disappears after a few uses, then no smell of any kind. Great! Also, doesn&#x27;t leave any film on the skin, but doesn&#x27;t leave it too dry either.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like this soap as much as original Ivory. Bars seem not to have lasted as long as original Ivory</li>
    <li> Bought these for my dad. He doesn&#x27;t like sent of soap, so these are the ones he can work with. He love this brand and it lasted him a while. Only issue is the price triple as soon as I bought him second set of 10. Over all the product is excellent and will recommend it to anyone who not used to soap Oder.</li>
    <li> Good for the girls. I need a bit more deodorant as a man.</li>
    <li> Also I like the liquid soaps for hand washing, I use only these bars in our bathroom.  They smell great, are easy on the skin and not drying.  And at a great price.</li>
    <li> no fragrances or harsh chemicals... the aloe makes it less drying. I recommend this and have and will continue to use the product.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat Ivory. Lathers very well, lasts longer than other brands, fresh, clean smell and feel.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the price, but i found it to be very good i have been using aveeno face wash for years and decided to use this soap for my face i can feel the difference it makes my face smooth and soft. So no more expensive aveeno for me.</li>
    <li> I like to buy soap on amazon, this one I haven&#x27;t purchased, I actually got a chance to use this at my friends house. It works better than the soap I&#x27;ve been purchasing in the stores. Best thing about it is that if you purchase on amazon you get tons of it, my friend showed me his big stack of soap. Better than wasting your time going to the store.</li>
    <li> I bought this at a local grocery store, thinking that it was standard Ivory soap, and put a bar by my kitchen sink.  For a couple of days, I noticed an unpleasant odor in the kitchen, and then realized it was the bar of Ivory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was my mistake that I hadn&#x27;t noticed that the wrapper says &amp;#34;aloe scent.&amp;#34;  I was surprised, however, by how strong the odor was when the soap was sitting unused and slightly damp.  Maybe some people like this scent, but I couldn&#x27;t stand it and threw the bars into the trash.</li>
    <li> I grow aloe plants and this fragrance doesn&#x27;t smell like aloe to me. Also its a bit too overpowering unlike their standard fragrance which is much lighter...</li>
    <li> Love the fresh smell of this soap - great price, especially Subscribe and Save pricing - my whole family likes it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Ivory for years and will never switch. The perfumey soaps smell sweeter and more feminine, but nothing will leave you feeling cleaner after a days work than Ivory.</li>
    <li> Pros : Didn&#x27;t dry up skin&lt;br /&gt;  Good quantity  n quality for Price.&lt;br /&gt;  Good lather&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Smell would have been better.</li>
    <li> Bought these for a trial when I was looking for something to patch up my Subscribe and Save deals for extra discount. It is very cheap at 10/$4. But cheap for reasons. It : 1. feels greasy and too slippery, like it contains something unsolvable in water . 2. does not cleanse as well as Dove and some other brands with the same amount of soap. 3. tends to stick on the towels and are hard to rinse off. 4. the aloe is a joke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do venture into some brands from time to time. This one is among the worst. I will use them for hand soap only.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used regular Ivory soap for years, so I thought the addition of aloe vera would be even better.&lt;br /&gt;After receiving my order, I read the ingredients.  There is barely any aloe, but there is &amp;#34;aloe scent&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I wanted soap with aloe mixed in ... this barely qualifies.&lt;br /&gt;2. The reason I buy Ivory is because it doesn&#x27;t have perfume or other extra chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I&#x27;ve been naive.From now on I will read the ingredients before purchasing.</li>
    <li> Ivory soap is pretty hard to get wrong! It works well and smells nice and floats so my kid can find it in the bath.</li>
    <li> Ivory is dependable.  You can count on it.  Been around for forever and is a good product.  Thanks so much</li>
    <li> If you are tired of the tiny Ivory bars then these are the ones you need, they are the largest bars of Ivory that I&#x27;ve ever used, and they are IVORY, what more do you want?</li>
    <li> This is the best soap, its Ivory and free of irritants plus it has aloe which makes leaves your skin even softer.</li>
    <li> not good if you have sensitive skin or allergies. Stick with the unscented version.</li>
    <li> smells very nice and one bar can last a really long time.</li>
    <li> The whole family uses this, I even use it on my 6 month old. Love the clean fresh smell, delicate and natural.</li>
    <li> I get this from my local Safeway for $3.99. I use it as a facial and body wash. It smells really good but it&#x27;s not strong. Since I started using it on my face, it has gotten so much softer and so much clearer. My mom also uses it to make laundry soap that won&#x27;t hurt your skin or cause rashes. A little goes a long ways so one bar will last quite a while</li>
    <li> The ivory bars of soap are awesome! They&#x27;re very comparable to Dove bars of soap. You can still tell that Dove soap is of better quality, but these are very close to that level. With that said, I actually like these bars more, because they last longer than Dove soap (Dove soap just dissolves so quickly!), AND they&#x27;re 1/4 the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These bars are very smooth and moisturizes your skin, I think just as well as Dove does. I don&#x27;t have issues with sensitive skin or rashes, so I can&#x27;t speak to that level. I believe I have relatively normal skin, and I would recommend this to everyone!</li>
    <li> Soap is Soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is inexpensive with a mild clean scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it.</li>
    <li> This is a nice soap, very lightly fragranced. Does not dry my skin...but neither does it leave an oily or greasy feeling. I would have given it 4 stars, but it melts sooooo fast! I keep the soap in the shower on a rapidly draining soapdish, out of the water for the most part, but it disappears far too quickly.</li>
    <li> We used Ivory when I was growing up.&lt;br /&gt;It floated.&lt;br /&gt;Thought I&#x27;d try it again.&lt;br /&gt;These are advertised as &amp;#34;bath&amp;#34; sized.&lt;br /&gt;They are definitely 4 oz bars but 4 oz translates into more of a hand soap size, not a big bath size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s Ivory.&lt;br /&gt;Floats&lt;br /&gt;Just basic soap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Smaller than you think it will be</li>
    <li> Love the smell of the aloe soap!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin that dries out quickly.  I also wash my hands often after being outdoors in the garden and playing with pets. This soft, lightly scented soap does not irritate my skin. In fact my skin feels softer and moisturized by this aloe blend. This is a great sopa at an exceptionally reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Love using ivory soap,can be used for almost anything and I&#x27;ve been using it for so many years and still&lt;br /&gt;Use it--A great product to keep on hand--Great to use on babies etc too</li>
    <li> I have always loved Ivory for its purity and cleanliness. Never a soapy feeling on your body after a shower.</li>
    <li> Smells great, doubles as air freshener. It disappears too quickly, and if used on face leaves it really dry. Though how it dry&#x27;s out skin worked wonders for my acute back acne, pretty much eradicated it quickly. Being said you get what you pay for, but I&#x27;m cheap.</li>
    <li> havent tried them yet but Ivory is Ivory.  The privce was great after the coupon.</li>
    <li> Nice bulk soap purchase.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because of the price AND because I am always dropping my soap in my walk-in tub and can never retreive it! It had been years since I used Ivory! It is different from what I remember, it was so silky and felt moisturized to me, my face was so clean feeling and smoothe. I even asked my daughter to feel my face and she agreed it felt really smoothe. I plan to continue to purchase Ivory. You get 10 bars!!</li>
    <li> Cheap soap that falls apart on your hand...</li>
    <li> I loved this soap..it is an improvement on the basic ivory soap that I knew as a child.  I smells great and does not leave a film on your skin. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Very old school brand love the up-dated version</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s soap what&#x27;s not to like</li>
    <li> this soap worked for us</li>
    <li> Ivory, whether Aloe or regular, is my favorite brand of bar soap.  It&#x27;s free of added perfumes, dyes and deodorants.  I just want a plain, non-irritating bar soap to wash with in the bath or shower.  Each bar seems to last a decent amount of time and they stick nicely to each other when they get small so I never have to throw any soap away.  And there is minimal packaging so not much to throw into the local landfill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I buy these as &amp;#34;add-ons&amp;#34; since they are so practical and everyone uses this brand every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 6.15.15 - I have learned since my initial review where I gave this product 5 stars, that it&#x27;s actually quite inferior to real soap and I have since stopped using it.  As a matter of fact, I have learned how to make my own, hand-made soap and it is beyond wonderful.  I will never buy store soap ever again.  You can try to find the the word, &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; on the Ivory label and you won&#x27;t because it&#x27;s not soap, it&#x27;s a skin-stripping detergent in which all of the glycerin has been removed.  It&#x27;s garbage.  Don&#x27;t buy it.  Spend a few extra bucks and buy some real, skin-loving soap from your local soap artisan.  You will be happy you did!!</li>
    <li> Very cheap, smells not bad, but bars break in the middle after several days when they are less than 1/3 used.</li>
    <li> Great price. I can not find this in the stores by me. I have never had a problem with this soap in drying out my skin.</li>
    <li> We love this soap and can&#x27;t find it locally. It smells nice and makes your skin feel so good.</li>
    <li> Great soap.  I can only use this soap and Dove, or I have serious allergy issues and my skin breaks out.  It lasts a family of 4 a long time and my husband loves it, he works in construction and thinks it does a good job as a face and body soap.  Only con is it doesn&#x27;t work as a hand soap for scrubbing something like paint off hands - for that, invest in a Lava bar.  As an everyday bath/shower soap, this is a great product.</li>
    <li> Good price but really bad quality from my experience.</li>
    <li> I like this soap a lot.  I generally use Dove soap but decided to give this a shot because it was at a good price and had great reviews.  I have found that it leaves my skin less itchy than dove. The only thing is it lathers differently than most soaps.  It is almost like a milky lather rather than foamy.</li>
    <li> these are nice, but are very large bars of soap.  I need them a little smaller next time. Nice soaps</li>
    <li> Cheapest soap on Amazon for subscribe and save, but they can&#x27;t keep it in stock.</li>
    <li> I chose this Ivory soap because it was the least expensive bar in the pharmacy. It gets the job done and you can&#x27;t beat the price, but every time I use it my skin retains a bit of a soapy reside. It cleans well, and smells nice, I just wish it has better moisture and didn&#x27;t leave a residue. In a battle versus Dove bar, I&#x27;d choose Dove.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product and delivered right to my door.  FANTASTIC!</li>
    <li> 99 &amp; 1/2pure...no idea what the other 1/2 is</li>
    <li> What can I say...it&#x27;s Ivory soap.  Lathers nicely.  Does not dry my skin.  No heavy scent.  It does what you&#x27;d expect from Ivory soap.</li>
    <li> I am on some heavy duty antiviral stuff.  It is killing my babysoft 61 yr old male skin&amp;#60;grin&amp;#62;.  I was told to go with soap, just soap, something not to rough, and Ivory is my choice.  Hate to admit it, but with a moisturizer I now have softer skin than before all this bother started.  Not that it matters.  If people start coming up to feel my striking babysoftness it may irritate me enough to change this review.  And it floats!</li>
    <li> These bars are narrower than what I&#x27;m used to from Ivory. Meh.</li>
    <li> Ivory you know it, you love it, if you find it cheap you buy it.  WTH happened to the larger bars?</li>
    <li> Easy on the skin.  Inexpensive.</li>
    <li> What a great buy. I&#x27;ve always used the basic Ivory and have have tried the Ivory with Aloe, But this is a great add-on to get over the free shipping price point and as mentioned above, a great buy.</li>
    <li> Good clean feeling soap</li>
    <li> This item was very bad quality.</li>
    <li> Ivory soap is good--I prefer Dove though.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Will continue to use.</li>
    <li> Purchased bars of soap to put in operation Christmas child shoe boxes Ivory floats in case it gets dropped in the river</li>
    <li> Have been using for years - love this soap. Not drying to skin.</li>
    <li> I did not expect this soap to be this good, it works well and is gentle on my skin. Finally found another soap I can use on my skin. I have sensitive skin and only use pear soap which is expensive. Glad I got a cheaper option</li>
    <li> Great product, no complaints</li>
    <li> One nice thing about these bars are their size. It seems like a lot of soap bars are 3 ounces nowdays but these are fullsize 4 ounce bars. In addition, they aren&#x27;t heavily perfumed, and lather nicely.</li>
    <li> Excellent multi-pack at a perfect price point, better than most bulk purchases at discount retailers or membership-type clubs.  Fresh product that works beautifully and lasts a while (doesn&#x27;t just melt away as some soaps do).  I highly recommend Ivory soap.</li>
    <li> It is a very good product, comparing  to the original ivory, this one is better. The smell is very good. i have used original and this one and both are great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am the only one who uses this soap at home and this soap finishes very fast.</li>
    <li> What can you say. It does what it&#x27;s suppose to. The scent is not overwhelming which is a good.</li>
    <li> This is my most favorite soap of all time.  It smells delightful--clean without being an overwhelming scent.  I am thrilled to see it on here.</li>
    <li> arrived on time...not bad price, I&#x27;d of rather had the original scent, yet my mate stated after using it, it was OK</li>
    <li> I like this soap, it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like Dial does. It also doesn&#x27;t have an overwhelming scent, it just smells like soap. The bars do seem to go quickly, kind of like Irish Spring. Or maybe I use a lot of soap.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright when it comes to soaps.</li>
    <li> After I got these I saw the same but for less at my local supermarket. Will stick to buying locally in the future.</li>
    <li> Decent bargain soap just hate the fact that it breaks into pieces when you get 60% thru the bar</li>
    <li> It is worth to buy. Simple bath soap for daily use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Ivory for how gentle it is, but this aloe version is an improvement on the original. While it doesn&#x27;t smell quite as good (though still smells pleasant), it is somewhat less drying.</li>
    <li> Amazon is the more economical choice via their subscribe and save here on Amazon.  Soap smells good and is not hard in skin. +1 for Aloe</li>
    <li> I quit using antibacterial soaps! This works great, smells great, large size bars...I&#x27;ll keep my Subscribe and Save...as long as the price doesn&#x27;t start rising!</li>
    <li> Soaps for reasonable price and it is not at all sticky as I read in some reviews.</li>
    <li> The product arrived quickly. It is the soap I always use, except with the Aloe addition which I had never tried . It worked out well.</li>
    <li> This was perfect for my grandkids.  I hate to share my shower gel, the grandkids just waste it.  Very good price and the aloe is very soothing.</li>
    <li> these bar&#x27;s are actually 4oz berly has a sent the bar  last As long as the zest ivery lasted for 3 showers  zest lasted for 5 showers a ten count far deal but 5oz would be better and iimprovements on and sudsing willl make it a better soap I&#x27;ll stay with zest aloe Vera soap 8count at Wal-Mart for $298</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about the scent of the soap, but it&#x27;s wintertime and usually my hands are cracked and bleeding. Now instead of them being rough and sore, my hands are much smoother after using only one bar, and looking rosy.  I will totally buy this soap again. Thanks, Ivory Aloe!</li>
    <li> I use this stuff most of the time and it&#x27;s as good as any other soaps I have used, I buy it mainly because it&#x27;s much cheaper than the others.</li>
    <li> I like Ivory soap. It does the job well. It&#x27;s notorious for breaking up into dozens of small pieces at the end of it&#x27;s life cycle however, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me because by then :)</li>
    <li> Packages look like crap. I bet these bars of soap are 20 years old. Wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money</li>
    <li> Great price $4.99 so I bought three packs.  Good soap, wasn&#x27;t a fan of ivory before, but I was looking for aloe so I gave it a shot.</li>
    <li> Simple soap bars that work. They leave you feeling clean with no residue and are cheap!</li>
    <li> smells nice. good soap</li>
    <li> Highly scented , i have asthma and this soap makes me wheeze. Its also hard to get the scent off your skin ! Rinsing your body off a few times doesnt do it .</li>
    <li> Ivory is a great soap and I recommend it for those who don&#x27;t like harsh perfumes and scents. I&#x27;m no longer able to use it, however, due to the increased sensitivity of my skin. However, it&#x27;s still an excellent product.</li>
    <li> The soap itself works fine, but the bars crumble apart within a few days of unwrapping, so lots of the product is wasted.</li>
    <li> This soap smells great! It lasts quite a while, much longer than Caress or the like yet not as long as regular Ivory.</li>
    <li> Soft and gentle. Smells great. Perfect for family use because the smell is gender neutral and soft. I have purchased several times and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> Remember the Ivory soap of years ago, a staple in your house? This is the real deal, updated with Aloe. I appreciate the bundle for the household and the value is excellent. No wonder 4 out of 5 moms recommend it. A great value on Amazon.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s soap. It&#x27;s Ivory. It&#x27;s good as always. I will buy it again when I run out. Nice and fresh scent too.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t get better than Ivory.</li>
    <li> I love ivory soap and this aloe version has a great scent.  My kids also like to use the soap to carve with their pocket knifes!</li>
    <li> The green label smells like Camay. Get the blue label.</li>
    <li> Great product. Great pricr</li>
    <li> product as described--</li>
    <li> These soaps are horrible.  They do not lather well nor have a good smell that makes you feel refreshed.</li>
    <li> good job on this soap IVORY. love the natural goodness without the extra junk that other brands put into their product. worth the extra price</li>
    <li> was looking for original ivory aloe.  green bars.....</li>
    <li> Ivory is where its at...Its all natural no perfume after smell....I usually use the reg. Ivory but thought I would try the ALOE scent and its awesome.</li>
    <li> I used to use dove but I tried this one and its better. In my area we have a lot of hard water and itchy skin is common. This soap is greate and no more itchy skin.</li>
    <li> Ivory is good, but harsh.  I need to get back to making my own.</li>
    <li> I bought 10 bars of soap for under $3--great price!!...until I received the product.  I&#x27;m not sure if it had melted during shipment but soap had a spongy consistency unlike any soap I have ever used.  I didn&#x27;t feel comfortable using it so its going in the trash.  Wasted $3z</li>
    <li> Good soap, But I like sharp smell in soap so if you are looking for mild smell and some soft texture soap you must purchase it. It&#x27;s a nice deal on this rate</li>
    <li> Finally found my soap. I went through four different products when searching for a natural soap. The quality and price of Ivory are terrific. Aloes amazing!</li>
    <li> Exactly as described, great price, thanks.</li>
    <li> Packaging sticks to the product, but the product itself is great.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s soap; I got really dirty, so I decided I should probably clean myself up once and a while.</li>
    <li> Was expecting something smoother on skin, will continue to use Dove. Wasn&#x27;t bad though, guess I am not a Ivory girl.</li>
    <li> I have used this product many times. It continues to be the quality that I&#x27;ve come to expect.</li>
    <li> Yes, Ivory with Aloe will keep rabbits out of your flower beds. You&#x27;ll need to replenish it after rain and check back frequently to be sure it&#x27;s still there. Plus keep your animals out of the beds. It works great. Plants that were kept eaten to the ground last year are thriving this year. Shred it, or chunk it and sprinkle around the plants. Rabbit away.</li>
    <li> We use the Ivory Aloe as our basic everyday soap, at all our sinks instead of liquid soaps. Best to use a good draining soap dish or the little pronged thingies that keep the soap above the dish &amp; out of the water. This is a mild soap but still cleans hands well. We like it a lot.  I will continue buying this Ivory soap for everyday practical use.</li>
    <li> I love this soap.  Ivory has always been one of my favorites but, with the aloe added its great.  In my opinion, this is more moisturizing than the regular Ivory and has a soft, clean scent.  Give it a try I think you will be really please with the results.</li>
    <li> My husband and I both love Ivory soap but we both agree (for a change) that we like the original scent Ivory better than the Aloe Ivory.  We&#x27;re clean though.............thanks Ivory Soap.  By the way, I did order a huge 16 pack of original Ivory for a very, very low price on Amazon also.  Check it out!!</li>
    <li> Great price ...  Great product ...</li>
    <li> cheap and practical. doesn&#x27;t have loads of extra stuff in the soap so it&#x27;s cheap, but buy lotion for after shower, otherwise you&#x27;re just washing the lotion down the drain if it&#x27;s &#x27;in the soap&#x27; like other brands.</li>
    <li> It floats! Hubby is a big fan of Ivory (though I am allergic). I prefer this scent to the original, though he prefers the original. I guess it is opinion, but this one ships with subscribe and save.</li>
    <li> A very good product at a very good price when it is combined with the  free shipping. Ivory Soap is Ivory Soap, that is, the best.</li>
    <li> These bars of soap are pretty good. No strong odor, so good for men and women. They don&#x27;t last for a long time though, but maybe that&#x27;s just me!</li>
