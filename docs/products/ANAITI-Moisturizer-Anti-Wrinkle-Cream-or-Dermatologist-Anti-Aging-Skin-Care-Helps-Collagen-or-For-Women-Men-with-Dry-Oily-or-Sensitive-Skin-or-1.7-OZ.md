      <li>I love the way this moisturizing cream feels when I apply it to my face - soft, silky, and creamy.</li>
      <li>On days I go makeup-free, I still apply some of this moisturizer to give my skin that clear, healthy look.</li>
      <li>Next, I apply my choice of sunscreen to these same areas and I am good for the day!</li>
      <li>She was right -</li>
      <li>This moisturizer is perfect for anti-aging properties as it actually makes my skin glow in a way that I only remember when I was very young.</li>
      <li>After washing and exfoliating my face, I apply a moderate amount of this moisturizing cream to my face, neck, and chest area - making sure that the product is really absorbed into my skin.</li>
      <li>I use it everyday and the results just keep getting better and better.</li>

      <li>I admit to having taking very poor care of my skin and, as a very fair blond, it is time to snap to and take care of myself far better.</li>
      <li>Since it has Quaxyl which helps reduce moisture loss and sagging skin and is deeply hydrating it really helped my arms look more toned.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>

      <li>It left both feeling hydrated and smooth.</li>
      <li>moisturizing cream really seems to have improved the look and feel of the skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> [[VIDEOID:d30a424e3c819eeebce26358615f2034]] My review after using for about a week!  I really love this cream.</li>
    <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has always been challenging to find a skin moisturizer I loved that worked with my skin tone. My  skin is quite sensitive to chemicals and whitening formulas, meaning I went through cream after cream only to get more and more frustrated as I continued to search. Luckily, a friend finally gave me this product from Anaiti as a gift. It turns out that copper peptide skin care is just the kind of mixture that I needed to moisturize my skin without affecting the pigmentation that I love.</li>
    <li> i received the item for testing and review purposes.&lt;br /&gt;i only give this a 4star .. sorry but i dont like the smell of this product ..&lt;br /&gt;but all in all i can say this one is good for ur skin..&lt;br /&gt;i use it for make up primer . and i can even use for day or night cream&lt;br /&gt;which is every convinient..plus its from canada.. so trusted product..&lt;br /&gt;im gonna buy the product again once i finished the other one..</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:73b3c743b87aa57dedce363671d8dfed]] I am so happy I found this moisturizer. I use it everyday and the results just keep getting better and better. It makes my skin feel very soft and supple without any oil feel about it. I also like that I can use it as a makeup primer and it helps my makeup to actually stay on my skin. This moisturizer is perfect for anti-aging properties as it actually makes my skin glow in a way that I only remember when I was very young. I use it also on my fine lines and wrinkles and it is getting rid of them better than anything I have ever tried before. I use it at night and during the day and my skin feels completely hydrated. The antioxidants in this moisturizer are really great because they help the skin to heal itself very quickly and to stay healthy looking healthy. I highly recommend it to anyone that wants beautiful skin!</li>
    <li> I use this 2 times a day Once in the morning and Once in the evening. Does not leave my skin greasy or oily,  Does not leave a nasty smell or leftover feeling either, Love  the fact that I can wear it under my makeup.</li>
    <li> Anaiti&#x27;s product has a unique formula of cutting edge ingredients &amp; can help protect skin from damage and keep it soft, smooth and younger looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is summer time and I am down in Georgia where it is so hot! You may not think that you need any moisturizers due to the humidity here, but you definitely do! Moisture is essential for preventing dry skin which can lead to wrinkles and other skin ailments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have incorporated this cream into my skin regimen and I am enjoying it very much! After washing and exfoliating my face, I apply a moderate amount of this moisturizing cream to my face, neck, and chest area - making sure that the product is really absorbed into my skin. Next, I apply my choice of sunscreen to these same areas and I am good for the day! My skin is a bit oily, so I make sure that I do not apply too much of the moisturizing cream. This product lasts all day and there is no need for me to reapply. I repeat this process again in the evening after I have showered to keep my skin moisturized and healthy all night long!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided to me at no cost. All thoughts are unbiased and of my own opinion.</li>
    <li> This is a nice moisturizing cream. I was sent a bottle to test for review purposes. It used it liberally on both my face and hands. It left both feeling hydrated and smooth. It does not feel sticky or greasy. Leaves skin feeling soft. No breakouts.</li>
    <li> I noticed that when I hit my mid thirties, my skin has started struggling to retain moisture. Less moisture usually means the onset of fine lines. This is why I started using products like Anaiti&#x27;s Advanced Moisture Cream together with Anti Aging Serums, as they help battle the early signs of aging. I truly like using this cream because it works well in getting rid of &amp;#34;dry skin patches&amp;#34; that can get pretty annoying specially when I&#x27;m applying makeup. Like I mentioned, I use it together with serums and it has been working really well on the fine lines that I have on the sides of my nose. It is very gentle on my sensitive skin and it addresses my skin issues. I highly recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I refuse to review or endorse products that I have not or will not personally try. Needless to say, I may be a product reviewer but my thoughts are real and none of the things I say on my reviews are made up or fake - they are all based on my experience/s with whatever product I am reviewing. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
    <li> The Advanced Moisturizing Cream by Anaiti is Made in Canada in certified facilities! It is non-toxic, paraben-free, and is not EVER tested on animals! This cream is made with only all natural ingredients, with an advanced and high quality formula, to help skin combat environmental damage and free radicals, fight the signs of aging, boost collagen, and deeply hydrated skin! The main ingredient, Aquaxytl , is derived from natural sugars and provides a shield from skin dehydration, which in turn boosts water circulation! Another important ingredient, Sodium Hyaluronate, complements Aquaxytl and makes skin more youthful, vibrant, and firm! This moisturizer cream also has Shea Butter to hydrate and soothe skin, while Antioxidant Sea Buckthorn Seed Extract protects skin from damage! This cream can be used on men and women of all skin types, and is gentle enough for daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used The Advanced Moisturizing Cream for almost a month now, along with other Anaiti products, for quick and real results! I&#x27;ve also used it alone to see how it made my skin look and feel, though I strongly believe using Anaiti products together is what has given me such visible results! I use this cream during the day under make up, and again at night! I always use this last in my beauty routine, so that it seals all of my serums in, and locks in moisture!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I love The Advanced Moisturizing Cream by Anaiti:&lt;br /&gt;-It comes in a 1.7 fl oz jar, which makes it easy to scoop out just the right amount!&lt;br /&gt;-It only takes a few dabs of this cream on my face, neck, and decollete to evenly cover everything. I know this jar will last me a while since it takes so little to rub in my skin!&lt;br /&gt;-I love the  lightweight, fluffy, and airy texture of this cream!

    <li> During my work day I am exposed to both extremely cold air and high-speed winds. For years I&#x27;ve tried to find something to treat my constantly chapped and dry skin. It got so bad, I was going through entire bottles of expensive night creams and other moisturizers on a weekly basis! This moisturizer has been the first thing that has effectively kept my skin from breaking and drying during the day. My nose and forehead--where most of my problems would occur--are no longer red and chapped by the end of work! My skin care routine is easier than ever and I find my skin is the softest it&#x27;s been in years! I use this every day, at work and at home. I have recommended it to all my co-workers as a solution for the stress our harsh environment can put on skin.</li>
    <li> Years have been taken off of my skin since using this Advanced Moisturizer. For over 3 weeks I have been using this product with wonderful results. It is hard to find a product that does what it says it does in description. This one has not fail me as of today. I will be doing a month review continuing on this product for August 2015 and hope that you will follow my blog on Fridays to see the result the results that continue on my skin. I have placed this on my skin daily and will post the blog weekly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packing of this product is great it comes in a beautiful design box but the quality of the bottles along with what is inside of the bottle. I can only say this is the BEST.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anaiti gave me this product for free for an honest #review of the product.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:b3378db7d33b3032b0b260596ab40781]] I have been amazed by the Anaiti line!!! This moisturizer is no exception. It leaves my very dry skin so hydrated and beautiful!! I would believe how well it worked if I hadn&#x27;t tried it myself. So give it a try to be amazed like I have been. It&#x27;s well worth the price to feel this beautiful all day long!!! This is one of the few products that I have received for free that I will be repurchasing when I run out, it&#x27;s that good! I did receive this product for free for review purposes, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I wear this under my makeup every day! When I wash my face at night, my skin look fresh and full, which I love! I also apply it as a night cream right before bed, since it&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and leaves my skin fresh and clean in the morning! I no longer have dry skin and my makeup never runs or gets that caked, flaky look some moisturizers cause. Even when I sweat (it&#x27;s dry where I live too, and can get very hot!) my face stays clear. My skin has never looked more flawless, day or night!</li>
    <li> I have been on the hunt for a day cream to wear under my makeup for years. I wear moisturizer every day, since I live in a very dry climate, and usually have a problem with it drying out or running down my face after an hour or so. This moisturizer is perfect for what I need; it lasts all day long and has become an essential part of my beauty and skin care routine. I feel like my skin breathes better, even with heavy makeup on. I love the outdoors, but the sun exposure has taken a toll on my skin in the past, but not anymore! Even after a whole day under the sun, my face doesn&#x27;t dry out or look crinkled. On days I go makeup-free, I still apply some of this moisturizer to give my skin that clear, healthy look. I have a naturally oily face and I&#x27;ve found this works great to keep that under control and even out my complexion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried various moisturizing creams over the years, from ultra expensive department store brands to cheap ones found at the drug store. All of them either left my face feeling &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; or oily, or did nothing at all.  Anaiti&#x27;s cream was recommended by a friend and I tried some of hers, and I&#x27;m so glad I did!  She was right - it goes on smoothly, doesn&#x27;t feel heavy, and it left my face feeling soft and smooth.  Buying this is a no-brainer for me.</li>
    <li> I am a middle aged woman and as we all know, as we age our skin loses its elasticity, loses moisture and these little wrinkle lines appear out of no ware. I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer cream from Anaiti for a few days now and I can already tell the difference. I use the cream both morning and night before I go to bed. The cream goes on smooth and my skin seems to really love it as I do. My skin really feels like it is moisturized but not oily or greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizing cream really seems to have improved the look and feel of the skin. I received this product for FREE in exchange for my unbiased review. I recommend this wonderful moisturizing cream for anyone who wants to stall the effect of aging on their skin. Great product.</li>
    <li> I love the way this moisturizing cream feels when I apply it to my face - soft, silky, and creamy. It&#x27;s almost as if I can feel it working as I rub it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the important question is, does it work?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, definitely! After two weeks of using it every day, my colleagues have commented how much more radiant my skin looks. Even my husband noticed, so it must be good!</li>
    <li> Since I have been testing out various other products I decided to test this one out on my arms.  There is a method to my madness!  As a beauty blogger I test out a lot of products and I have discovered that anti-aging creams are really good to use on your arms to help keep the skin on the arms looking youthful and to avoid that annoying crepe paper looking skin that tends to occur as we get older.  At 42 years old, I need all the help I can get!&lt;br /&gt;This Advanced Moisturizer Cream by Anaiti works perfect for that area!  Since it has Quaxyl which helps reduce moisture loss and sagging skin and is deeply hydrating it really helped my arms look more toned.&lt;br /&gt;This cream is also recommended as an eye cream, hand cream and all over body lotion so I went ahead and tried it out on those areas as well and had similar results.  It&#x27;s just another great product by Anaiti!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I did receive this product at a discount or complimentary in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.  However, I was not paid in anyway and my thoughts and opinions are my own.***</li>
    <li> I apply this face cream at night and in the morning. I have found that either time works for me and lasts all day long. I was worried about breakouts, since my skin tends to react badly with long-wear products, but I haven&#x27;t had any problems at all. I have also noticed my skin looking fuller and even brighter, and it definitely helps not to have a dry face all day.</li>
    <li> Awesome moisturizer, my skin just gobbles it up. I tend to have a dry skin in the cold weather and this has been so very helpful in keeping my skin looking fresh and even-toned. It lasts all day and my skin looks more supple as a result, no matter time of day or weather.</li>
    <li> This Advanced Moisturizing Cream by Anaiti is a soft, creamy moisturizer that is perfect for my aging, dry skin. I admit to having taking very poor care of my skin and, as a very fair blond, it is time to snap to and take care of myself far better. At 66 years old, I really don&#x27;t have much time left!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I clean my skin morning and night, I first apply a small amount of the Luminous Serum. After it has been absorbed, it&#x27;s time for this moisturizing cream. It only takes a little of the cream to work into the skin on my face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to thank the people at Anaiti for their complete line of skin care. Next time I get paid, I am going to order the eye cream to get rid of my horrible puffiness!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The prices are right and the products are fantastic. This line has any product your skin will need. They are great gifts for yourself, a friend of a relative. Don&#x27;t wait!</li>
    <li> I discovered pure glycerin when my hands started getting cracks and nothing else would heal them. Glycerin is an amazing ingredient with healing and restorative properties. If it woks so good on my dry cracked hands then it must be great for restoring youthful skin right? I am very pleased with this product and its easy to apply under makeup. It spreads super easy and foundation makeup goes on better after its applied ( I actually feel like I&#x27;m using less foundation since I started using this face cream). I trust glycerin and the other ingredients are just icing on the cake. Great product!</li>
