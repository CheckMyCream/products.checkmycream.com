      <li>I put it on and people ask what is that nice smell.  </li>
      <li>The scent is nice, I am not the hugest fan of gel deodorants, though.</li>
      <li>This is a great fresh scent.  </li>
      <li>A nice fruity scent and easy to apply formula,  I just dont know where they got &amp;</li>
      <li>Wearing a tank top?</li>
      <li>is that it contains ingredients of most deodorants/antiperspirants (aluminum, etc.), which I would rather avoid...</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s 24 at most.</li>
      <li>I love the way this smells.  </li>
      <li>If you like clean smelling deodorant BUY IT!</li>
      <li>Thanks for a good product.</li>
      <li>not too strong.</li>
      <li>To get the variety of these Anti-Perspirant/Deodorants is fantastic -</li>
      <li>goes on really smooth, never clumpy</li>
      <li>but when I first put it on I knew it was only good for its smell!</li>
      <li>No annoying white marks on clothing -Lasts a good amount of time (don&#x27;t need to buy it too often)</li>
      <li>/&gt;Keeps me smelling clean and delicious all day long and into the next day.</li>
      <li>Awesome deodorant for hours (but I don&#x27;t normally have a heavy</li>
      <li>this works well as a deodorant and has mild fruity aroma that is just right.</li>
      <li>Secret gel is just the best for the working woman.  </li>
      <li>its all right....</li>
      <li>-Smells fresh, clean, fruity -Effective (usually don&#x27;t need to reapply it, but sometimes I do when the weather is warmer) -Both</li>
      <li>I love the Women&#x27;s Gel and the scents last - I&#x27;m always asked here in Australia</li>
      <li>unless you love feeling like you&#x27;ve recently had The Blob in a headlock, you&#x27;ll hit each pit with a hair dryer set on its lowest setting for about 10-15 seconds per pit before moving on with your day.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;d love to find an &amp;#34;invisible&amp;#34; solid that is REALLY invisible.</li>
      <li>although I can&#x27;t remember exactly how much I pay for it in stores</li>
      <li>goes on clean and keeps me fresh all day,even till the next day.  </li>
      <li>I also really like the smell of this one</li>
      <li>I like the way solid deoderants feel when I put them on (dry, powdery, effective) much better than the way gel deoderants feel (wet, oozy, self-defeating)</li>
      <li>After you get the yucky wet feeling to go away, this stuff really does do a good job keeping you dry!  </li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;- soft subtle fragrances that never overpower wearing alone or with your own perfume.&lt;br /&gt;- and does the job!  </li>
      <li>I keep buying this particular one for that reason.  </li>
      <li>They are white, if you dare change your shirt after putting that stuff on you&#x27;d better be changing into a white shirt because you&#x27;re about to get deoderant smudges on it.</li>
      <li>extra 30 seconds spent doing something weird in the bathroom each morning is a small price to pay to smell awesome all day long, and this deoderant definitely smells awesome.</li>
      <li>Secret&#x27;s solid deoderants are great products in every way except that they are not invisible, not even close,</li>
      <li>-Clear!</li>
      <li>not when they are first applied, not 20 minutes later, not ever.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t wear off throughout the day and is definitely clear on my clothing.</li>
      <li>like that it goes on clear and in the summer..</li>
      <li>Clear gel does not show</li>
      <li>and it goes on clear and stays that way, so</li>
      <li>So far, no luck whatsoever.</li>
      <li>Keeps me dry all day hot flashes and all</li>
      <li>for product, its gel, and smooths on nicely-- no clumping, and drys pretty fast.</li>
      <li>swipe under each arm and leave for a few minutes and you are ready to go!</li>
      <li>In the winter I can use the solids with no problem but living in the deep south where summer days are long, hot, humid, and the nights are not much cooler, the gel is a must!</li>

<li> white residue thing is totally not a problem with Secret clear gel deoderants, they are actually clear, just as Secret promises.</li>
<li> think it&#x27;s worth mentioning that I have tried Secret&#x27;s &amp;#34;invisible&amp;#34; solids just to compare them to the gel deoderants I usually use.</li>
<li> It is very rough and leaves rashes on my arm pits!</li>
<li> its not amazing</li>
<li> Once I tried Secret, nothing else came close to its effectiveness for me.</li>
<li> I have used Secret for years.</li>
<li> I tried almost every brand on the market before trying Secret and was beginning to think I would not find an antiperspirant that would work for me.</li>
<li> , it goes well with my perfume (weird, I know).</li>
<li> Disappointed!</li>
<li> I have to use gel since powder leaves terrible residue on my clothes and myself.  </li>

    <li> The only scented deodorant I like!</li>
    <li> The scent is nice, I am not the hugest fan of gel deodorants, though.</li>
    <li> its all right....its not amazing&lt;br /&gt;i like that it goes on clear and in the summer..the gel is cooling&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i wouldnt use this during colder months</li>
    <li> Works well - but contains Ply-ethylene glycol. The same stuff as in anti-freeze and is controlled by the EPA. Dont want to rub it into my underarms!</li>
    <li> Secret gel is just the best for the working woman.  I use several scents and have used for years now.&lt;br /&gt;Best features:&lt;br /&gt;- Clear gel does not show&lt;br /&gt;- goes on really smooth, never clumpy&lt;br /&gt;- does not stain clothing and especially suit jackets that I wear every day&lt;br /&gt;- comes out of clothing with the was, and suit jackets at the dry cleaners&lt;br /&gt;- soft subtle fragrances that never overpower wearing alone or with your own perfume.&lt;br /&gt;- and does the job!  never an odor or perspiration.</li>
    <li> I love the way this smells.  I put it on and people ask what is that nice smell.  It provided good protection against wetness and odor too.  If you like clean smelling deodorant BUY IT!</li>
    <li> goes on clean and keeps me fresh all day,even till the next day.  has a great tropical scent.  will continue to order.</li>
    <li> Awesome. I get compliments constantly on my scent, and it&#x27;s just under my armpits! I can&#x27;t imagine the deliciousness of a matching body spray!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keeps me smelling clean and delicious all day long and into the next day.</li>
    <li> Keeps me dry all day hot flashes and all</li>
    <li> A nice fruity scent and easy to apply formula,  I just dont know where they got &amp;#34;48 hour&amp;#34;  effectiveness from - it&#x27;s 24 at most. Good thing I take showers more often than every 48 hours!</li>
    <li> Smells awesome but when I first put it on I knew it was only good for its smell! It stings my skin every time I put it on my armpits! It is very rough and leaves rashes on my arm pits! And the smell only lasts for an hour! Disappointed!</li>
    <li> Pros: -Smells fresh, clean, fruity -Effective (usually don&#x27;t need to reapply it, but sometimes I do when the weather is warmer) -Both a deodorant and antiperspirant -Clear! No annoying white marks on clothing -Lasts a good amount of time (don&#x27;t need to buy it too often) -Price seems fair (although I can&#x27;t remember exactly how much I pay for it in stores - I haven&#x27;t bought it from Amazon yet)  Cons: -The only con I can think of is that it contains ingredients of most deodorants/antiperspirants (aluminum, etc.), which I would rather avoid...</li>
    <li> Smells great! Works wonderfully and does not leave residue.</li>
    <li> This is the best deoderant I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s a gel and it goes on clear and stays that way, so it won&#x27;t put those gross white streaks on clothes or make those ultra-gross little white deoderant boogers in your pits. So, change clothes all you want and wear those tank tops. (Please shave because eeew.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s worth mentioning that I have tried Secret&#x27;s &amp;#34;invisible&amp;#34; solids just to compare them to the gel deoderants I usually use. I like the way solid deoderants feel when I put them on (dry, powdery, effective) much better than the way gel deoderants feel (wet, oozy, self-defeating) and I&#x27;d love to find an &amp;#34;invisible&amp;#34; solid that is REALLY invisible. So far, no luck whatsoever. Secret&#x27;s solid deoderants are great products in every way except that they are not invisible, not even close, not when they are first applied, not 20 minutes later, not ever. They are white, if you dare change your shirt after putting that stuff on you&#x27;d better be changing into a white shirt because you&#x27;re about to get deoderant smudges on it. Wearing a tank top? Be prepared to check your pits in a mirror and evict any deoderant boogers that have formed there since your last pit-check half an hour ago. Yeah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The white residue thing is totally not a problem with Secret clear gel deoderants, they are actually clear, just as Secret promises. However, they do go on a bit slimy so unless you love feeling like you&#x27;ve recently had The Blob in a headlock, you&#x27;ll hit each pit with a hair dryer set on its lowest setting for about 10-15 seconds per pit before moving on with your day. I think and extra 30 seconds spent doing something weird in the bathroom each morning is a small price to pay to smell awesome all day long, and this deoderant definitely smells awesome.</li>

    <li> To get the variety of these Anti-Perspirant/Deodorants is fantastic - I love the Women&#x27;s Gel and the scents last - I&#x27;m always asked here in Australia what scent I&#x27;m wearing!!!</li>
    <li> wonderful scent. this works well as a deodorant and has mild fruity aroma that is just right. not too strong.</li>
    <li> If i could lick my pits i would..it smells that good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for product, its gel, and smooths on nicely-- no clumping, and drys pretty fast. No residue either!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus...they smell AMAZING~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUY BUY BUY!!!</li>
    <li> Best scent yet and works great!</li>
    <li> I have used Secret for years. I tried almost every brand on the market before trying Secret and was beginning to think I would not find an antiperspirant that would work for me. Once I tried Secret, nothing else came close to its effectiveness for me. In the winter I can use the solids with no problem but living in the deep south where summer days are long, hot, humid, and the nights are not much cooler, the gel is a must! For some reason it has a longer staying power for me. I could not imagine ever trusting another brand!</li>
    <li> This is a great fresh scent.  I keep buying this particular one for that reason.  The formula itself works well.  It doesn&#x27;t wear off throughout the day and is definitely clear on my clothing.</li>
    <li> Nice Smell!  I have to use gel since powder leaves terrible residue on my clothes and myself.  Awesome deodorant for hours (but I don&#x27;t normally have a heavy smell.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One swipe under each arm and leave for a few minutes and you are ready to go!</li>
    <li> Thanks for a good product.</li>
    <li> Smells great and doesn&#x27;t stain clothes!</li>
