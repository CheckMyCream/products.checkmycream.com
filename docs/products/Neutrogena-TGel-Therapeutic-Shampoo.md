      <li>The medication in T/Gel works the best if used regularly.</li>
      <li>worked for me better than the zinc dandruff products.</li>
      <li>used for more than 15 years with no any issue.</li>
      <li>Lather, brush, wait a couple more minutes, then rinse.  </li>
      <li>Great price and shipped fast</li>
      <li>: I try to make sure I have a hat available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and it feels lots better after showering with it.  </li>
      <li>flakes... doesn&#x27;t get any more PRO than that.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Just have to make sure that I use a conditioner after.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll use it uo mostly though.</li>
      <li>I lather, then I use a shampoo brush to lightly work my scalp.  </li>
      <li>I always follow it up with a very good conditioner to counteract any drying effects the shampoo might have, which is normal for any shampoo, and my hair is soft, manageable, and beautiful-without any scaling or itching.  </li>
      <li>She was willing and able to prescribe something, but after I expressed my hesitancy she said &amp;</li>
      <li>Let&#x27;s just say it&#x27;s unique.</li>
      <li>Luckily it goes away in a couple hours though.</li>
      <li>How can quickly expired products to sell ！！！</li>
      <li>I have fairly mild psoriasis.</li>
      <li>I like the T/Gel brand a bit better because I&#x27;m accustomed to the Neutragena soaps (possibly a better soap, and possibly a bit of liking the fragrance better.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>after the 2nd time of use, i was able to see the results!</li>
      <li>At home, I&#x27;ve been using the cheaper Head and Shoulders Mint Sensitive Scalp Shampoo which works okay also.</li>
      <li>Worth a try.</li>
      <li>But I think that the smell is fine as I have much healthier skin in addition to having smooth and soft hair.</li>
      <li>This wasn&#x27;t a Super price, but better than locally.</li>
      <li>Got it very fast, but after uncovering the taped over expiration date showed Nov 2013.</li>
      <li>I plan on buying more in the future.</li>
      <li>Wouldn&#x27;t recommend for a woman with long hair but great for the short haired guys.  </li>
      <li>I used head and shoulders at first, but i guess my skin just got used to it.</li>
      <li>your hair first, then wash with this stuff.</li>
      <li>a seal of approval of sorts (&amp;#34;Recognised&amp;#34;) authorised by the National Psoriasis Foundation.  </li>
      <li>It is true that the product that was shipped to me had a near expiration date.</li>
      <li>Rinse it out really good&lt;</li>
      <li>I;ve been using for 3 weeks not and it doesn&#x27;t really help with my scalp psoriasis.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed I&#x27;m not scratching my scalp as much</li>
      <li>/&gt;it works very well as medicine.</li>
      <li>I was really hoping it would but no results.</li>
      <li>I really disklike the smell of the shampoo.</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t use it regularly, this could be an issue, but I wouldn&#x27;t think the efficacy would drop off significantly just after it expires.</li>
      <li>better just to get the small bottle and see if it works for you first.</li>
      <li>It is a very unique smell, which is neither bad or good.</li>
      <li>this works better than any other shampoo on the market.i have a dry itchy scalp</li>
      <li>and i&#x27;d say my scalp is 75-80% clear</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed that it doesn&#x27;t work, but haven&#x27;t really noticed a big difference.</li>
      <li>T-gel gives my hair body and takes away all the flakes while leaving it soft, unscented and manageable.</li>
      <li>But for me it has finally fixed my problem with dandruff and itchy scalp.</li>
      <li>I have very stubborn scalp psoriasis, but when I use T-Gel Therapeutic Extra Strength shampoo, it GOES AWAY</li>
      <li>I was scratching my scalp so much it started bleeding, so I went down to the store and got some of this Neutrogene Therapeutic.  </li>
      <li>After swimming laps daily  for the last year and a half my scalp and body suddenly developed an itchy sensitivity perhaps to the new chemicals they are using in the pool these days.  </li>
      <li>T/Gel  is one of the few that contain certain coal-tar derivatives, and that seems to give my case a day or two of  respite.  </li>
      <li>The product was good but the expiration date was bad...</li>

<li> T/Gel  is one of the few that contain certain coal-tar derivatives, and that seems to give my case a day or two of  respite.  </li>
<li> The product was good but the expiration date was bad...</li>
<li> My skin was dry and constantly itchy under my beard</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used several other brands for my psoriasis problem on my scalp and this is the only one that truly works.</li>
<li> The active ingredient in the shampoo has vastly improved the quality of my living by assuaging my persistent issue since I was in middle school.</li>
<li> Did not notice much of a difference from the normal strength T/Sal medicated shampoo, but it doesn&#x27;t smell as bad as the normal strength.</li>
<li> /&gt;-Low price, lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> This is one of the few products I can actually rely on to relieve me from the irritation of dandruff both physical and fashion related.</li>
<li> I mean work it in really good&lt;</li>
<li> This was purchased to help my dogs with their shedding &amp; dry skin.</li>
<li> Once in a while dry scalp happens because of medication and or weather.</li>
<li> I won&#x27;t mention all the previous products I&#x27;ve used; to say the least they didn&#x27;t do much.  </li>
<li> Works as expected.</li>
<li> no more itchiness or red skin!</li>
<li> Had used other products before.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if it actually works.</li>
<li> My husband uses this shampoo every day &amp; it usually costs $8-$9 per bottle for the Extra Strength.</li>
<li> All disclosures aside, I still prefer this product to the other dandruff solutions.</li>
<li> scalp gets a little dry.  </li>
<li> The only negative I have to say is the smell of the shampoo.</li>
<li> I have been having difficulty finding the extra strength version of T-Gel, but as usual, Amazon had it!</li>
<li> I found this on Amazon for almost half price - two bottles for about $10.</li>
<li> it is now Sept 2013, so less than two months.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m still trying it because I know that sometimes it can take a little perseverance, so I will keep trying.</li>
<li> /&gt;Complete waste of time/money/and energy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> a side note, it has a few warnings regarding sunburn after usage.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for years, but it&#x27;s difficult to find in local stores, so of course I turned to Amazon.  </li>
<li> life saver, ther is no better product for Seborreheic Dermatitis</li>
<li> No more proplems with scratching my head and no more itch.</li>
<li> I bought it maybe in late September, and it expires at the end of December.</li>
<li> A little on the expensive side here</li>
<li> I have tried them ALL and they either burn, tangle my hair so badly I can&#x27;t even pull a comb through it, or dry my hair out making the problem worse or they stink.</li>
<li> secret is to let it sit for a min or 2</li>
<li> Beware its a lousy deal if you have to throw one out at $1.00 an oz.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This does the job, but the two that was send to me was almost expired... The product was good but the expiration date was bad...</li>
    <li> My dermatologist had given me a sample of T-gel, and I found it to relieve my itch from Sebhoreic Dermatitis, where prescriptions treatments did not.  I hope it will provide relief with continued use.</li>
    <li> I really disklike the smell of the shampoo. Smells similiar to tar. Seems to work on dnadruff however</li>
    <li> Great price and shipped fast</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for years, but it&#x27;s difficult to find in local stores, so of course I turned to Amazon.  It&#x27;s the best shampoo for dandruff, seborrhea, and psoriasis that I&#x27;ve ever used.  I have very stubborn scalp psoriasis, but when I use T-Gel Therapeutic Extra Strength shampoo, it GOES AWAY and I don&#x27;t eve have any itching.  It&#x27;s the only shampoo that has ever controlled the problem.  I always follow it up with a very good conditioner to counteract any drying effects the shampoo might have, which is normal for any shampoo, and my hair is soft, manageable, and beautiful-without any scaling or itching.  It&#x27;s practically a miracle.</li>
    <li> Thought I was getting a very good deal, so good the first  place of purchase ran out while ordering. Got it very fast, but after uncovering the taped over expiration date showed Nov 2013. it is now Sept 2013, so less than two months. Beware its a lousy deal if you have to throw one out at $1.00 an oz. I will give one away,hoping I don&#x27;t offend anyone.&lt;br /&gt; Just checked price and it $4.00 cheaper as an add on. Now I really hate it.</li>
    <li> I suffer from seborrheic dermatitis and this stuff works wonders.  It is the best medicated shampoo I have ever used.  WARNING, it stinks.  I would try to be nice but it smells awful.  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend for a woman with long hair but great for the short haired guys.  A little on the expensive side here but what can I say, I keep forgetting to get it at cheaper places.</li>
    <li> I;ve been using for 3 weeks not and it doesn&#x27;t really help with my scalp psoriasis. I was really hoping it would but no results.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 15 years and its the only thing that fixes the issue for the people who say it doesn&#x27;t work your using it wrong&lt;br /&gt;1. Rinse hair&lt;br /&gt;2. Lather T-gel in I mean work it in really good&lt;br /&gt;3. Let it stay in for 2 mins&lt;br /&gt;4 Rinse it out really good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The secret is to let it sit for a min or 2 trust me this is the only thing that will work I have tried everything else</li>
    <li> After swimming laps daily  for the last year and a half my scalp and body suddenly developed an itchy sensitivity perhaps to the new chemicals they are using in the pool these days.  I was scratching my scalp so much it started bleeding, so I went down to the store and got some of this Neutrogene Therapeutic.  I&#x27;ve noticed I&#x27;m not scratching my scalp as much and it feels lots better after showering with it.  Just leave it on while you soap up your body, then rinse together.  At home, I&#x27;ve been using the cheaper Head and Shoulders Mint Sensitive Scalp Shampoo which works okay also.</li>
    <li> This is one of the few products I can actually rely on to relieve me from the irritation of dandruff both physical and fashion related.</li>
    <li> Pretty good, lather it in your hair when you begin your shower and leave it until you are ready to leave the shower for best results.</li>
    <li> My skin was dry and constantly itchy under my beard and I tried 4 different shampoos. This product worked within 2 days for me. The only negative I have to say is the smell of the shampoo. Let&#x27;s just say it&#x27;s unique. Luckily it goes away in a couple hours though.</li>
    <li> I recommend this shampoo to anyone with oily, flaky hair. I have tried them ALL and they either burn, tangle my hair so badly I can&#x27;t even pull a comb through it, or dry my hair out making the problem worse or they stink. T-gel gives my hair body and takes away all the flakes while leaving it soft, unscented and manageable.</li>
    <li> Did not notice much of a difference from the normal strength T/Sal medicated shampoo, but it doesn&#x27;t smell as bad as the normal strength.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this shampoo every day &amp; it usually costs $8-$9 per bottle for the Extra Strength. I found this on Amazon for almost half price - two bottles for about $10. You cannot beat that price anywhere. A very good value.</li>
    <li> I have been having difficulty finding the extra strength version of T-Gel, but as usual, Amazon had it! Good price, too.</li>
    <li> I had some irritation in my scalp and upper neck.  Quite bothersome.  Maybe an allergy.  This stuff took care of it.  Worth a try.</li>
    <li> I have seborrheic dermatitis and this is the only shampoo that actually controls my dandruff.  I lather, then I use a shampoo brush to lightly work my scalp.  Wait a couple of minutes.  Rinse.  Lather, brush, wait a couple more minutes, then rinse.  I do this twice a week and it is the only thing that works to control my dandruff.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product for many reasons. But for me it has finally fixed my problem with dandruff and itchy scalp. The active ingredient in the shampoo has vastly improved the quality of my living by assuaging my persistent issue since I was in middle school. I plan on buying more in the future. Also the smell isn&#x27;t bad at all. It is a very unique smell, which is neither bad or good. But I think that the smell is fine as I have much healthier skin in addition to having smooth and soft hair.</li>
    <li> I tryed almost all the trade-marks out there. This shampoo looks like the only one working against scalp inching. I have been using it for 2 years already and it still does the job. Good quality, dicent price.</li>
    <li> For decades I&#x27;ve struggled with dandruff (both scalp and beard.)  I won&#x27;t mention all the previous products I&#x27;ve used; to say the least they didn&#x27;t do much.  T/Gel  is one of the few that contain certain coal-tar derivatives, and that seems to give my case a day or two of  respite.  I like the T/Gel brand a bit better because I&#x27;m accustomed to the Neutragena soaps (possibly a better soap, and possibly a bit of liking the fragrance better.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;T/Gel sports a seal of approval of sorts (&amp;#34;Recognised&amp;#34;) authorised by the National Psoriasis Foundation.  (However, the box admits that &amp;#34;Neutragena pays a royalty to NFP for use of their logo.)  All disclosures aside, I still prefer this product to the other dandruff solutions.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it actually works. This was purchased to help my dogs with their shedding &amp; dry skin. I t was recommended by someone. I haven&#x27;t noticed that it doesn&#x27;t work, but haven&#x27;t really noticed a big difference. I&#x27;m still trying it because I know that sometimes it can take a little perseverance, so I will keep trying.</li>
    <li> get rid of that Seb Derm / Dandruff!</li>
    <li> i dont know if the shampoo is good or not. but when i received it, it was leaking, so i had to return it</li>
    <li> Forget how well the stuff does or doesn&#x27;t work...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller sold me two bottles of T/Gel that are EXPIRED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Complete waste of time/money/and energy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and just go to the drug store.</li>
    <li> This wasn&#x27;t a Super price, but better than locally. It is true that the product that was shipped to me had a near expiration date. I bought it maybe in late September, and it expires at the end of December. I&#x27;ll use it uo mostly though. If you don&#x27;t use it regularly, this could be an issue, but I wouldn&#x27;t think the efficacy would drop off significantly just after it expires.</li>
    <li> Had used other products before. This is sofar the  best,very good results.No more proplems with scratching my head and no more itch.</li>
    <li> It is about to expire, these will expire in June 2013 , But I bought a 5 PACK。 How can quickly expired products to sell ！！！</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to anyone that has scalp issues. It has worked well for me. The shampoo has a good lather.</li>
    <li> I have fairly mild psoriasis. This makes it not itch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it works very well as medicine. It works very badly as shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;wash your hair first, then wash with this stuff.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT COMES A TIME IN EXCELLENT CONDITION VERY RESPONSIBLE SUPPLIER, WE RECOMMEND 100% WHAT YOU FOR YOUR KINDNESS CERTIFY</li>
    <li> Excellent product. used for more than 15 years with no any issue. Works as expected. I would recommend this product</li>
    <li> this works better than any other shampoo on the market.i have a dry itchy scalp and this is the only one that has come close to working.</li>
    <li> Good Shampoo does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything else, and this just does the trick.  I&#x27;d experimented with the regular strength, and I could tell that it was working... but I still had flakes.  During my yearly physical, I decided to ask my doctor what I should do.  She was willing and able to prescribe something, but after I expressed my hesitancy she said &amp;#34;why don&#x27;t you just try the extra strength version?&amp;#34; .... um... yeah, I should have thought of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note, it has a few warnings regarding sunburn after usage.  I&#x27;ve not noticed a difference, but I do combat it in two ways, 1: If I know I&#x27;ll be outside, in the sun the next day for prolonged periods, I use another &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; shampoo. 2: I try to make sure I have a hat available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-No flakes... doesn&#x27;t get any more PRO than that.&lt;br /&gt;-Low price, lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-My scalp gets a little dry.  Just have to make sure that I use a conditioner after.</li>
    <li> I did not find this helpful and it smells terrible.  I&#x27;m writing this review to tell people that its second ingredient - after water - is Sodium Laureth Sulfate, a detergent.  Detergents are potentially very bad for your skin, and I have quit using this.</li>
    <li> I started using this product ten years ago on the recommendation of my hair dresser and I&#x27;m still using it today.</li>
    <li> I have psoriasis on my scalp that acts up during the colder months and this stuff works. I used head and shoulders at first, but i guess my skin just got used to it. I&#x27;ve used it twice now and i&#x27;d say my scalp is 75-80% clear and it also helps with the itching. Flakes are gone but there are still patches that need to heal. I&#x27;m so happy this product works. Flakes are ugly and it&#x27;s so uncomfortable. I will use this product until it stops working.</li>
    <li> life saver, ther is no better product for Seborreheic Dermatitis</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several other brands for my psoriasis problem on my scalp and this is the only one that truly works. when i have an outbreak i use it once or twice and then for weeks/months i don&#x27;t have an breakout, love it!</li>
    <li> Once in a while dry scalp happens because of medication and or weather. The medication in T/Gel works the best if used regularly.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  I use it 3 times a week! after the 2nd time of use, i was able to see the results! no more itchiness or red skin!</li>
    <li> worked for me better than the zinc dandruff products. better just to get the small bottle and see if it works for you first.</li>
    <li> Actually got this for my dog and it did work.  Very good service and got when I really needed it.</li>
