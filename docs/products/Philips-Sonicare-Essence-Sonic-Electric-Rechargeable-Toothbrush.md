      <li>Am pleased with item.</li>
      <li>SATISFIED</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>She literally loves everything about this toothbrush and she has been raving about how clean her teeth feel!</li>
      <li>The most important difference seems to be the battery type.</li>
      <li>I am fine with it.</li>
      <li>We received the Sonicare toothbrush very quickly and are delighted with this, our fourth Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>This one is lighter and easier to clean</li>
      <li>Read some reviews about keeping the unit clean.  </li>
      <li>Simple and effective.  </li>
      <li>First electric toothbrush and</li>
      <li>First purchase, at the suggestion of my dentist, of a &amp;#34;electronic toothbrush&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>Very good but no 30 second vibration stays cleaner than previous models.</li>
      <li>And the results have been positive.</li>
      <li>I like the thiner head as it is easy to reach my back teeth.</li>
      <li>Works very well.</li>
      <li>Works very well.  </li>
      <li>Thanks you for the prompt service.</li>
      <li>Holds a charge very well.  </li>
      <li>It is very efficient and we wouldn&#x27;t be without one.</li>
      <li>Brushed well but had to brush twice in order to have my mouth feel clean.</li>
      <li>Who needs one that&#x27;s easier to clean if you&#x27;re saving big money with no whammies?</li>
      <li>A little too early to tell how it will stand up, but works well and is easy to clean.</li>
      <li>Wish it would beep after the 30 second mark to say when to switch quadrants, but else is super.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>After using it for a few weeks I am surprisingly satisfied with the results.  </li>
      <li>Just like my old one, only a little better with the non slip grip.</li>
      <li>I received the product, The Box says HX5611, but the toothbrush inside is marked as HX5610 with date 12/12/11</li>
      <li>Kickin&#x27; it old school.</li>
      <li>Replaced my son&#x27;s old toothbrush - he LOVES it.</li>
      <li>Can see a big difference from the old brush.</li>
      <li>Only wish it had the 30 second beeper like my old one.  </li>
      <li>The brush heads are a little more expensive than those for the pricier handles - I haven&#x27;t done the math, but assuming those last as long, the models that use the more compact heads may save money in the long run.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Had my other one for over 18 years.  This one is lighter and easier to clean</li>
    <li> The product works as advertised and I&#x27;m hoping that my dentist will get off of me about my gum health...we&#x27;ll see in a few months.</li>
    <li> Works very well.  Holds a charge very well.  Only wish it had the 30 second beeper like my old one.  All in all I am fine with it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my best friends birthday present and she is completely in love with this toothbrush!! She literally loves everything about this toothbrush and she has been raving about how clean her teeth feel! I will be buying one for myself and my entire family!</li>
    <li> It met all expectations.</li>
    <li> Excellent product..1st replacement in our home in over 15 years of 2 adults using twice a day. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My husband calls this our Angry Bee!  Love it. Can see a big difference from the old brush.</li>
    <li> Very good but no 30 second vibration stays cleaner than previous models.</li>
    <li> This model doesn&#x27;t have a beep when you should change zones but I&#x27;m getting used to it.</li>
    <li> Performance is excellent and reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> Been using it for years the only thing I use</li>
    <li> was not powerful at all. Brushed well but had to brush twice in order to have my mouth feel clean.</li>
    <li> Works as expected!! . . . It&#x27;s a Sonicare!!  You cant lose.</li>
    <li> I like the thiner head as it is easy to reach my back teeth. Is a bit noisy though</li>
    <li> First purchase, at the suggestion of my dentist, of a &amp;#34;electronic toothbrush&amp;#34;.  After using it for a few weeks I am surprisingly satisfied with the results.  Great product. Simple and effective.  Read some reviews about keeping the unit clean.  This too is simple as long as you remove the brush and wipe it off occasionally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had past issues with gum problems. That appears to be improving with this system.  SATISFIED</li>
    <li> A little too early to tell how it will stand up, but works well and is easy to clean. Wish it would beep after the 30 second mark to say when to switch quadrants, but else is super.</li>
    <li> This is my second Sonicare. It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> We received the Sonicare toothbrush very quickly and are delighted with this, our fourth Sonicare toothbrush.  It is very efficient and we wouldn&#x27;t be without one. Thanks you for the prompt service.</li>
    <li> Just like my old one, only a little better with the non slip grip. Great price.

    <li> Tried and true, a great value. Kickin&#x27; it old school. Who needs one that&#x27;s easier to clean if you&#x27;re saving big money with no whammies?</li>
    <li> Am pleased with item. Works very well.</li>
    <li> Love this toothbrush!  And the results have been positive. But the gunk between the brush head and battery unit has destroyed the unit. So glad for this model and lower price so that if this is what is going to continue to happen I can afford to keep buying and using this toothbrush.....</li>
    <li> Excellent Product - we are sold on this type and brand of rechargeable electric toothbrushes - easy to use and for years we&#x27;ve all been having great checkups from our dentist - some of us have never even had a cavity!!  Highly recommend using one of these for dental care - we&#x27;ve always been pleased with the product(s), plus received great service, too!</li>
    <li> I specifically ordered HX5611, which is a newer release for the Sonicare Essence (HX5610)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received the product, The Box says HX5611, but the toothbrush inside is marked as HX5610 with date 12/12/11</li>
    <li> Replaced my son&#x27;s old toothbrush - he LOVES it.</li>
    <li> perfectly as expected</li>
    <li> First electric toothbrush and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I have used Philips Sonicare electric tootbrushes for years, and this one, like its predecessors, does a great job.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this!</li>
