      <li>it&#x27;s just a good conditioner to use after shampoo.  </li>
      <li>I love this!</li>
      <li>I love it!  </li>
      <li>On my second day of use I had my best hair day in months!!</li>
      <li>I think it is a much better alternative than some of the stuff you find on store shelves</li>
      <li>Same great formula! &amp;#34</li>
      <li>I wanted it to smell better.</li>
      <li>but I have received better results (softer/ silkier hair) from cheaper shampoos I have tried.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>I like the way the product works and has many non-chemical ingredients - a bit pricy.</li>
      <li>The almond fragrance is mild which is good because I would not want it strong.</li>
      <li>This is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve every used for my normally dry hair.</li>
      <li>I got a free tube of this from HouseParty.  </li>
      <li>, I love that it is &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; and the first week</li>
      <li>I wish this brand had a true conditioning treatment masque type of product.  </li>
      <li>or so my hair was soft and nice but after two weeks I started to notice my hair was getting dryer and frizzier..</li>
      <li>Smells pretty, too!</li>
      <li>Love the scent and the conditioner leaves my hair soft and shiny.  </li>
      <li>I use this with the shampoo and my hair is soft, healthy and has some shine.  </li>
      <li>but this seems just right.)  </li>
      <li>The first few weeks were great.</li>
      <li>light smell and just what I needed for my very sensitive scalp!</li>
      <li>I will definitely be buying more soon.</li>
      <li>After the first two washes, I realized I didn&#x27;t have to use the conditioner every time.</li>
      <li>Every time I brushed my hair there would be more hair in the brush than I&#x27;ve ever seen before.</li>
      <li>However after some time my hair (naturally straight), began to dry out and break very, very easily.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff for my frizzy, dry hair!</li>
      <li>But I like it so much I&#x27;ve bought 3 tubes of it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also important to me that this product has low toxicity.</li>
      <li>I was amazed at how much of a difference this made in my hair.  </li>
      <li>Really like this product.</li>
      <li>Conditions very well, even on my damaged hair.  </li>
      <li>it makes my scalp feel nice and conditioned, without a heavy perfumed smell.</li>
      <li>I first started using this early 2014...</li>
      <li>My hair feels young and supple and that&#x27;s a first after 50+ years.</li>
      <li>I would love to find an ecofriendly shampoo and conditioner that actually worked, but unfortunately it&#x27;s definitely not this one.</li>
      <li>It is very moisturizing and leaves my hair soft.  </li>
      <li>seem to give moisture to the hair without weighing my fine hair down.</li>
      <li>In OTHER STORES AMAZON NEED TO LOW THE PRICE AND WILL BUY MORE ...</li>
      <li>This plus the shampoo leave my hair so soft!  </li>
      <li>I guess they made much money now they are cheap with the ingredients or have no more of it to offer</li>
      <li>My hair is shiny, soft and manageable.  </li>
      <li>My hair was shiny and soft.</li>
      <li>When I used it, my hair was soft, degangled and manageable</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t mind the smell (like anise) and my hair is soft and manageable...</li>
      <li>and it does not get the job completely done.  </li>
      <li>Even when used after the shampoo, it made my hair so soft.  </li>
      <li>Decent enough conditioner I thought.  </li>
      <li>I use so much and my hair feels brittle and falls off due to constant detangling caused from using the shampoo first.</li>
      <li>I have fine, medium hair, so I only put this conditioner on the ends, usually just a pea-sized amount, if that.  </li>
      <li>About the only complaint I have, and it is minor, is that it doesn&#x27;t smell as nice as some of the other ACURE shampoos.</li>

<li> (I have very fine, curly hair that isn&#x27;t very thick - products that are too heavy weigh my hair down</li>
<li> Would not recommend applying to entire head as it will perhaps weigh down hair unless you try using a tiny bit.  </li>

<li> It would frizz like crazy and was just so ugly and dry.</li>
<li> PRODUCT!BUT IS EXPENSIVE</li>
<li> I am not impressed.</li>

    <li> IS VERY GOOD PRODUCT!BUT IS EXPENSIVE STILL I FOUND IT FOR $6.79 In OTHER STORES AMAZON NEED TO LOW THE PRICE AND WILL BUY MORE ...</li>
    <li> I wanted it to smell better. I am not sure this will be a repeat buy.&lt;br /&gt;Does seem to give moisture to the hair without weighing my fine hair down. Plus!!</li>
    <li> The ONLY thing that actually promotes hair growth that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Great product! Smells pretty, too!</li>
    <li> May b terrific for some ladies, however, this wasn&#x27;t helping me. My hair is too dry and frizzy.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I will definitely be buying more soon.</li>
    <li> i am using this after losing my hair (chemotherapy). it makes my scalp feel nice and conditioned, without a heavy perfumed smell.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff for my frizzy, dry hair!</li>
    <li> light smell and just what I needed for my very sensitive scalp!</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery and product just as described</li>
    <li> The first few weeks were great. My hair was shiny and soft. However after some time my hair (naturally straight), began to dry out and break very, very easily. Every time I brushed my hair there would be more hair in the brush than I&#x27;ve ever seen before. It would frizz like crazy and was just so ugly and dry. I would love to find an ecofriendly shampoo and conditioner that actually worked, but unfortunately it&#x27;s definitely not this one.</li>
    <li> I like the way the product works and has many non-chemical ingredients - a bit pricy.</li>
    <li> I am not impressed. It will collect on your hair. I bought a Clarifying Shampoo to counter it. I am looking for another shampoo, I do not recommend you buy this unless you have used it before and like it.</li>
    <li> I love it!  And I have color treated hair.  After the first two washes, I realized I didn&#x27;t have to use the conditioner every time. My hair feels young and supple and that&#x27;s a first after 50+ years.</li>
    <li> I got a free tube of this from HouseParty.  I was amazed at how much of a difference this made in my hair.  I have hair that is almost down to my pants.

    <li> I use this with the shampoo and my hair is soft, healthy and has some shine.  The almond fragrance is mild which is good because I would not want it strong. I have to wash my hair every other day because my scalp feels dirty if I don&#x27;t but my hair could go an extra day.</li>
    <li> Truly amazing product! Best conditioner I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Conditions very well, even on my damaged hair.  I slipped back into using box dyes and sulfates and paid for it with almost 2 years of chemical-free progress.  I have fine, medium hair, so I only put this conditioner on the ends, usually just a pea-sized amount, if that.  Would not recommend applying to entire head as it will perhaps weigh down hair unless you try using a tiny bit.  It is very moisturizing and leaves my hair soft.  I think it is a much better alternative than some of the stuff you find on store shelves, some of which have some crazy ingredients that just don&#x27;t belong on your hair or skin.</li>
    <li> This plus the shampoo leave my hair so soft!  I don&#x27;t mind the smell (like anise) and my hair is soft and manageable... On my second day of use I had my best hair day in months!!</li>
    <li> I like this stuff, my curly hair is alot tamer with this!</li>
    <li> Love the scent and the conditioner leaves my hair soft and shiny.  (I have very fine, curly hair that isn&#x27;t very thick - products that are too heavy weigh my hair down but this seems just right.)  It&#x27;s also important to me that this product has low toxicity.</li>
    <li> If you buy their shampoo buy this conditioner!! My hair and scalp was so dry without it. But I gave it a 3/5 because still results were not amazing for me, I love that it is &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; and the first week or so my hair was soft and nice but after two weeks I started to notice my hair was getting dryer and frizzier.. I hate to say it but I have received better results (softer/ silkier hair) from cheaper shampoos I have tried.</li>
    <li> This is a great conditioner.  It&#x27;s not really a &#x27;treatment&#x27; though - it&#x27;s just a good conditioner to use after shampoo.  I wish this brand had a true conditioning treatment masque type of product.  Its a really good brand, moisturizing, does not cause acne.</li>
    <li> Did not buy on Amazon, but wanted to see if anyone else had my experience.  Decent enough conditioner I thought.  But, is it my imagination or does it smell like the &amp;#34;puck&amp;#34; in a urinal?</li>
    <li> Great product but pricey</li>
    <li> Really like this product. Smooths curly frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> Where this conditioner is concerned,  something has definitely changed this year.  I first started using this early 2014...some time in february or march. When I used it, my hair was soft, degangled and manageable (I have afro american hair - 4C).  Even when used after the shampoo, it made my hair so soft.  I never needed a scissor to clip out nuts of falling hair that got tangled.  This year, forget about it!!!  Both the shampoo and conditioner has become unreliable.  I use so much and my hair feels brittle and falls off due to constant detangling caused from using the shampoo first. Now time for the conditioner and it does not get the job completely done.  I had to break out the aussie condition and undo what this acure condition and shampoo caused in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No idea what changed.  I guess they made much money now they are cheap with the ingredients or have no more of it to offer so they changed the bottle appearance - the ingredients is different.  It&#x27;s a marketing strategy I have always hated.  &amp;#34;New look. Same great formula! &amp;#34; I don&#x27;t think so.  I will not purchase again. Ever....</li>
