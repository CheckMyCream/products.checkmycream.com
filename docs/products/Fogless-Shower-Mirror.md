<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this  from my my local Bed Bath &amp; Beyond about a month now and couldn&#x27;t be happier. This mirror is unique for three reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*First - it isn&#x27;t fog RESISTANT its fogless. That means you don&#x27;t have to reapply a fog resistant chemical/spray as it ages. That is great news!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Second - It&#x27;s not something that will just fall off. For better or for worse this mirror is adheared to your shower with heavy adhesive pads (similar to Command Strips) AND silicone that is applied to the back of the mount. The silicone needs 24 hours to cure, but after that you&#x27;ll never have to pick it up off the shower floor or try and adhere it to just the right spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Third - it has a built in LED. This was the main selling point for me. The small LEDs on the left and right side of the mirror provide the perfect amount of light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mirror also allows you to ajust the angle so that you can shave, and then the misses can lower it so she can see while she exfoliates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall an excellent product. The only thing this mirror is missing compared to others that I have used is the ability to a just the magnification of the mirror. Even with out that, I still give it 5 of 5.</li>
    <li> the silicone this is interesting but inst fool proof.&lt;br /&gt;the mirror is prone to gaps where water can leak.</li>
    <li> Awesome product and fiancé loves it ! He said every man needs one of them. They also are very durable !!!</li>
    <li> Second one I&#x27;ve bought for our home and still very happy with both!</li>
    <li> Works well, doesn&#x27;t fog, perfect reflection.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and works exactly as described.  It is a little larger than a hanging shower mirror w/ suction cups you would purchase at the store, so try and hang it where it won&#x27;t be in your way while showering.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best shower mirror out there, and I&#x27;ve tried them all.</li>
    <li> Mirror works very well. Have used for several days with no disappointments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Installation was also a surprisingly easy using the combination of sticky tape and small tube of adhesive. The mirror comes in two pieces (black plastic) with the &amp;#34;back plate&amp;#34; with mounting bracket adhering to the wall. The instructions say to wait for 24 hours ... I gave it 12 and had no issues with it slipping or detaching from the wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the positive reviews are accurate. This is a great shower mirror. Five stars.</li>
    <li> Good performance, but no nice construction.</li>
    <li> Works exactly as described. Easy install,fill with hot water and no fog! Nice large mirror! You will not regret this purchase.</li>
    <li> My husband likes this mirror so much, we bought one for our son-in-law.  I also bought the travel version for my husband.  Works great.</li>
    <li> The first truly fogless mirror I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> This mirror works exactly as promised! I read a review on thesweethome.com &amp; after reading all the reviews on here, I knew it would be awesome. It is the only fog free mirror that is &amp;#34;truly fog free&amp;#34; &amp; I&#x27;ve even bought a mirror that was branded as &amp;#34;truly fog free&amp;#34;!!! Thanks a bunch. :)</li>
    <li> Great shower mirror. It is a simple system, easy to care for and works great. Great company service. I wishIhad found it before I wasted money onshower mirrors that didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Works great, never fogs up when I&#x27;m using it.</li>
    <li> never fogs up when their is water in it.  only thing is squidgy doesnt really get all the water away and i cant figure out how to clean the water spots off mirror without damaging it.  But the foglessness is really great and the movable head works well for my family, who are all varying heights.  The little shelf is very usefull.  glad i read all the reviews.</li>
    <li> Setup is real easy, and unlike traditional suction cup design bath mirrors, this one feels much more secure out of the gate.  Since I am near sighted, I would still use my glasses with my old bath mirror just so I could see more detail while shaving.  That is not necessary with this thing, it has a very clear, magnified reflection which is so great.  The fogless feature is actually pretty clever.  The mirror can hold water therefore bringing the mirror to the same temperature as your shower which in turn keeps it clear.  The onboard squeegee is real nice to so cleaning is a snap.  Totally recommend this especially if you are tired of the falling, fogging, suction cup mirrors like I was.</li>
    <li> I have tried numerous &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; mirrors though the years, and they last a few months and then the coating wears off and they fog up.  The thing I like about this one is that there is no coating to wear off. It just doesn&#x27;t fog up.  It uses the basic principle of physics that fog won&#x27;t form on a surface warmer than the surrounding air. I thought I would be a pain to have to fill it up with hot water every time I wanted to use it, but it just takes a few seconds. I have only had it a few weeks, so I don&#x27;t know how durable it will be.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Mounted it directly to glass surround. Product works great.</li>
    <li> It sticks to the wall and it doesn&#x27;t fog up (assuming you follow the directions and fill it with hot water).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No complaints here. It&#x27;s exactly what I expected it to be.</li>
    <li> The title pretty much says it all.  I installed the mirror about a month or so ago and it has performed flawlessly since then.  Big plus is that the only place to install it in my shower was to a rough-surface tile.  All my previous suction-cup-held mirrors dropped periodically.  No problems with this mirror.  Recommend the mirror w/o reservations.</li>
    <li> The product was missing the adhesive. We called the company and left a message so we could right the situation. We left a message and it has been a week now and no answer since then. As far as product goes for quality, not bad. But the customer service lacks!</li>
    <li> This item is exactly what I expected. My husband shaves in the shower with no issues. Neither of us find filling it with warm water to be difficult. I like using it to pluck my eyebrows (not as painful when the pours are open from the warmth) All in all we are extremely pleased and have had no issues in the past month since we put it up!</li>
    <li> The mirror itself works as it should. You have to fill it each time you use it with warm water to keep it from fogging up which is kind of a pain. But the worst part about this thing is it WILL NOT stay attached to my shower tile!! Twice it has fallen down and broken apart in the middle of the night causing my husband and I to jump up in bed in terror!!! It stays up maybe for 2 days and them comes crashing down!! And we used the glue provided, cleaned the tiles prior to installation and still no luck!</li>
    <li> This is a Great product. It has worked Wonderfully. Stays fog free and clear for a Great Shave. Have had many &amp;#34;fog less&amp;#34; mirrors in the past but none has ever stayed fog free. Highly Recommend</li>
    <li> I love my new mirror. definitely worth the price, better than the cheap store bought mirrors. I recently had a new shower put in and had my mirror professionally installed</li>
    <li> I had a mirror in my old house that actually hooked up to the shower head that lead hot water to the mirror.  That worked out but was a complete eye sore.  This product is perfect.  I never thought i would use the squeegee but I use that all of the time.  It never fogs up and instructions were very simple.</li>
    <li> Well made product. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Fiancé LOVES this! Doesn&#x27;t dog much at all</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and I have owned several mirrors for the shower and this one is the best I&#x27;ve ever had! The filling it with hot water to keep it from fogging was a stroke of genius!</li>
    <li> It works exactly as stated. Just fill the back with warm water and use. No need for any chemicals or wipes etc. Simple.</li>
    <li> The window fogs up unless you fill it with water. Not something i want to do each time i want to shave. Would have preferred a thin mirror that doesn&#x27;t take up much room</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used 3 different shower mirrors before this one. Both the ones that require water and not. This one is far better than any of the others.</li>
    <li> I rarely write reviews but I just love this mirror. I have been through countless mirrors before this and most were okay at best. After a while the coating would wear off or the mirror was made of something other than glass and wouldn&#x27;t hold up. None of them presented a truly clear reflection needed for shaving. The folks at Toiletree hit this one out of the park! It&#x27;s a simple concept that works flawlessly coupled with an elegant design. The glass remains clear during my shower and I can get a great shave. Few things function so well. Thank you Toiletree.</li>
    <li> Stays on the wall, has a handy shelf and mini wiper and it is a good size...but it does fog.</li>
    <li> Compared to mirrors from Frontgate, my husband loves it but wishes it had a light.  Recommend it for men who shave in the shower.  Would recommend they find a way to put a light on it.</li>
    <li> It is much better than all the previous mirrors I&#x27;ve used.  I keep a dry wash cloth to wipe any splash drops off and my image is very clear.  A previous tip said to use a glass, plastic, to pour the hot water into the mirror to keep it free of fog.  Works very good; I fill up the glass with hot water before I turned the temperature down to shower and then I empty out the previous day&#x27;s water and put in the new hot water.  Perfect.</li>
    <li> Works great! Just what I needed. Easy to remove mirror to load/empty water.</li>
    <li> Works as described.  Would be 5 stars if it had a hook for loofa, wife&#x27;s razor, etc.</li>
    <li> Works great and stays fogless. Using the squeegee once at the end of each shower keeps the mirror clean. The silicone mounting is nice and I wish it had other mounting options like hooks to go over the top of the shower or around the shower head. But still, this mirror is deserving of 5 stars. The LED version would have been a great upgrade but I decided to go with this non LED version due to cost.</li>
    <li> We just had our shower redone and I wanted a new mirror to shave by. This one is a bit larger than some and has a shelf for your razor and a squeegee that slides in the bottom. It is fog less if you remove the mirror from the holder each time and fill the reservoir with hot water, otherwise it will fog. It is not an issue and the connection is easy to make. It comes with two sticky patches mounted on the back and a tube of silicone that you have to spread for it to adhere to your shower wall. Instructions indicate the silicone is easily removed if you no longer want the mirror.</li>
    <li> Granted we have only used this mirror for about two wks but as other reviewers noted it does not fog up if you keep it filled with hot water. After checking the dimensions of the mirror I knew that this would fit perfectly in one of the cut out shelves in our shower so I removed the mounting bracket.</li>
    <li> Love it. The way it is made, there&#x27;s no way it can not work, unless it is not properly affixed to the wall. After a few months it did fall off the wall but was easily glued back. The fall did not damage it. Just be sure the surface to which it is glued is absolutely clean. I use it on days that I want to save some time shaving and don&#x27;t feel like hovering over the sink.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with the Fogless Shower Mirror. It was easy to install and when the reservoir is filled it really is fogless. I find that I can still use the mirror without filling the reservoir simply by using the squeegee. The mirror looks good also!</li>
    <li> My Nephew says so far so good on the mirror.</li>
    <li> Good mirror.  works well, but does start to fog after owning it for a year.</li>
    <li> What more can i say other than it totally works - no fog on the mirror whatsoever.  Easy to use - I love it!</li>
    <li> Very good instructions and easy to install.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used the product a couple of times, but there is no fogging, and the squeegee helps keep the mirror clear when water gets on it.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with this Fogless Shower Mirror.  It just the right size for my shower -- big enough but does not get in your way.  It is truly fogless by filling it with warm water, and the little squeegee cleans off the mirror.  One suggestion:  Before you install it, use a leveler to pencil in a line before installing it....I forgot to do that &amp; mine is a little uneven.  I plan to take it off &amp; reinstall it.</li>
    <li> Great product. Make sure to follow the mounting instructions and you will be pleased. I have not had any trouble with fog at all! Great purchase.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift for my father for his birthday.  It seems he needs a new fogless mirror every year, as the treatments go bad over time.  The idea that this uses warm water behind the mirror to keep from fogging, rather than a chemical treatment, is genius.  It was a purchase that was supposed to end the incessant need to replace shower shave mirrors.  It has thus far failed to do so, as he has been unable to get it to stick to his shower wall.  Good idea, poor delivery.</li>
    <li> It is mostly great, but the mirror has a slight fish-bowl effect.</li>
    <li> Most of all, I like the way this looks.  It has a TV type of look and feel to it, and was super simple to install.  The fogless option works well, but I probably don&#x27;t have my located in the same area most people do.  I have a shower caddy hanging from the shower head, so there&#x27;s no room for the mirror there.  So, I placed the mirror on the opposite end of the shower (in the back).  Perhaps that helps keep it fogless, or perhaps the product really works like it should.  You could keep a simple plastic cup in the shower in order to fill the reservoir with warm water just in case.</li>
    <li> This mirror works wonderfully! My husband wanted a new mirror for the shower that said was fogless and actually was.  This one is! It has a nice big mirror and tilts up and down when needed. I gave it 4 stars only because I wish it had a better place for razors to sit and when/if a razor is placed on it only one can be there. But other then that this is highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This is the second one I have owned.  The first was great and the second has a few improvement that makes it even bettrer.  After about 4 years the first started to tilt downward on its own when full of water.  The new one has a better tilting mechanism that will not allow this to happen.  I have owned the ones that hook directly to the shower head and they are ususlly built cheap and leak.  Also, If you install it correctly it will not fall off of the wall.  This is a good product.</li>
    <li> The mirror gives a distorted image. Would not buy a gain for the price.</li>
    <li> I have purchased numerous shower mirrors over the years and this is the first one I have EVER owned that lived up to the expectations. Just follow their instructions and you will be a satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> FANTASTIC MIRROR...  Only way to go above 5 stars would be to have hooks on the bottom for the few items that would benefit from them in the shower but thats purely subjective.  AMAZING MIRROR!</li>
    <li> Just ordered the larger one with LED lights for a second bathroom as my husband loves shaving in the shower.  Definitely keeps the bathroom sink area cleaner too!  Great product.</li>
    <li> This mirror is not fog proof.  You have to keep wiping off with squeegee.  Please do not mislead people.. This is not true is description.</li>
    <li> So far this is a great product. No problems hanging the mirror; I&#x27;ve only used it once but it worked perfectly.</li>
    <li> Works ok - very cheaply made</li>
    <li> I wished I would have thought of this. Best shower mirror without question.</li>
    <li> Been using if for a month. Fantastic product. Hasn&#x27;t shown a single sign of even one water vapor droplet on the mirror!</li>
    <li> We got this mirror to replace one that would not stay on the wall and constantly fogged up.  This mirror is great.  It is easy to install and is actually held very securely by the silicon glue.  The mirror stays perfectly clear even during the steamiest shower.  It is nice to be able to see while I shave.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Smartly designed setup that is working very well so far. My only complaint is that it was packaged in non-recycleable plastic.  Come on now, it&#x27;s 2015.</li>
    <li> There is NO BETTER Fogless Shower Mirror!  Stop your search and buy this one.  I purchased one may years ago and recently purchased a new one (only because I wore the old one out).  Everything is as advertised, the most perfect solution to keeping the mirror clear, and I&#x27;ve moved several times with it, so removal and reattachment is a cinch!!! A+++</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I&#x27;d like this but it works great for shaving in the shower.  The water you add keeps it from fogging up.  The adhesive makes the mirror stick solidly to our tile shower.  I even like the little razor shelf and squeegee which I wasn&#x27;t sure about.  Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> The mirror works, I&#x27;ll give it that. But the clips are cheap plastic and having water in the back makes this mirror heavy. The moveable part on the back broke within a week of having it. Too expensive of a product to last such a short time!</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s no fog on the mirror, the reason is the back of the mirror is open to the heated bathroom air behind the shower head.</li>
    <li> Great mirror, im in the military and shave every morning and have to in the shower, never ever fogs, awesome mirror</li>
    <li> Zero problems. Sticks to the wall like it never wants to let go. You don&#x27;t even need to put that much water in it for it to stay from fogging. Sometimes, if I&#x27;m quick , I only need to get the mirror wet with hot water. Visibility is great, no weird effects. Removing and putting the mirror on and off main hanging unit is done with ease.</li>
    <li> Has worked very well for boyfriend in the shower despite all the negative reviews I read prior to purchase. He is very diligent about putting cold water in the well prior to starting his shower. He has liked this from day 1.</li>
    <li> works great, &amp; doesn&#x27;t ever fog when you follow the directions....well worth the money.</li>
    <li> If you shave in the shower, then you&#x27;ll love this. My only drawback is after 5 months or so the silicone that came with the mirror lost it&#x27;s adhesiveness and it fell off the shower. I am about to remount it using a better quality silicone and should be good to go.</li>
    <li> What a great shower mirror. Fill it up with your hot shower water and within less than a minute it is fog free. Great little shelf for holding your razor. Well constructed with no distortion. Easy install. Would highly recommend for those men that shave in the shower!</li>
    <li> Followed instructions on hanging mirror and fell off within hours. Left a lot of silicon on the tile that won&#x27;t come off.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband after his cheap one kept falling off the shower wall and broke. He is so happy with it. It&#x27;s large enough he can see what he&#x27;s doing and its sturdy. The price seemed steep but when I saw how well made it was I realized it was worth it. He has no complaints!</li>
    <li> Awesome to finally shave in the shower. Works as advertised. The other fogless shower mirrors wont live up to this spend the extra few to get one that will last work as advertised its worth it.</li>
    <li> Stays on the wall so far. Not impressed with the no fog as one has to fill the mirror with warm water to achieve no fog.</li>
    <li> I have an extremely heavy beard and I always shave in the shower.  I have tried multiple fog-less shower mirrors with poor results.  This mirror is fantastic and it&#x27;s claims are completely true.  Thank you</li>
    <li> Works great, I love it.</li>
    <li> cool product but not a fan of filling with hot water</li>
