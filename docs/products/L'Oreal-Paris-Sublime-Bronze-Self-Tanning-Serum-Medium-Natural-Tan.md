      <li>and I love the glow that this serum is giving to my face...</li>
      <li>I truly totally love it.  </li>
      <li>I love this sell tanning serum.</li>
      <li>I am going to do one more application tonight before bed</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried L&#x27;Oreal tanning products before, and they were as OK as any others.</li>
      <li>I love the feel of this light serum!</li>
      <li>as they seem to take up more color.</li>
      <li>product is a light amber gel with a nice citrus-y/bronzer aroma that lingers but does not offend.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I only applied this 2 times and I was already noticing a difference very happy with the results</li>
      <li>For instance, I am a cyclist, and I like to use this product to even out the areas my bike shorts and top cover when I go to the beach or the pool.</li>
      <li>If you have to walk around, make sure not to lean or rub up against anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>

      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used it mostly on my legs</li>
      <li>applying self-tanner, always be sure to thoroughly exfoliate your skin beforehand.  </li>
      <li>L&amp;#34;Oreal did it again with this great product at a reasonable price.  </li>

      <li>I was so hoping to love this.</li>
      <li>Most have eliminated the tell-tale orange but the quality of tan produced</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it.  </li>
      <li>though I&#x27;m pretty fair</li>
      <li>However, on my body this is pretty good.</li>
      <li>/&gt;To begin with, the consistency is more gel than lotion and goes on smoothly.</li>
      <li>have fair skin, and I don&#x27;t need 3 consecutive days for this to look like a nice, light natural color</li>
      <li>just look AMAZING right now.  </li>

      <li>Easy application.</li>
      <li>I can afford to have lines because they are easily blended with the bronzer.</li>
      <li>If you want good results for a specific event, it&#x27;s best to start several days in advance.</li>
      <li>My arms were fine</li>
      <li>You do this so the product does not absorb more quickly into these areas and become darker than the rest of your body.</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t have an odor that I noticed.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Read somewhere to mix some of this with your favorite body cream and apply it that way for a gradual, natural look.  That&#x27;s how I used it and it worked very well.  Took the &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; away without turning me into a giant orange!</li>
    <li> I prefer the self-tanning towels, like TanTowel, but I thought I&#x27;d give this a try. I&#x27;m fair and cool-toned. I tried this on my face and it made an age spot darker, so I won&#x27;t use it there again. However, on my body this is pretty good. I mix it with a moisturizer and it&#x27;s like the Jergens Natural Glow self-tanner used this way. Although this is concentrated, slightly over 3 ounces in this bottle won&#x27;t last long, so mixing it with a moisturizer will stretch it out and make streaking less probable. Three days of use so far, and I have a natural-looking non-orange light tan with no streaks.</li>
    <li> I use self tanners occasionally and really never found any that I loved and this was no exception.  I have darker skin, not olive but i always look like i have a tan.  I followed the instructions,  exfoliated etc and used this for 3 days.  I did notice a slight color change but in the sunlight outside, it looked a bit orange.  Not alot orange like alot of these products, just a bit orange.  It went on smoothly enough and it was easy to use.  Maybe because my skin is on the tan side already it looked orangy.  I used it on my legs.  I asked a few people what they thought and they all said it looks good, which is why i gave it 4 stars.  If they thought it looked good, then maybe it looked better than I saw it.  I would use this again in a pinch if I needed a tan to appear in 3 days.  It&#x27;s not the worst of tanners.  It&#x27;s actually on the better side because of the smooth feeling, soft skin and quick drying and like I said, there is a color change in my skin but in the bright sunlight it just looks a bit orangy.</li>
    <li> I have tried many self tanners over the years with mixed results. Most have eliminated the tell-tale orange but the quality of tan produced still varies between products.&lt;br /&gt;This new L&#x27;Oreal self tanning serum successfully combines several things I like in a self tanner.&lt;br /&gt;To begin with, the consistency is more gel than lotion and goes on smoothly. The scent is pleasant and does not leave a chemical oder behind.&lt;br /&gt;Lotion products tend to leave my face in particular feeling too greasy, especially as the product develops. This serum does not.&lt;br /&gt;The tan develops slowly over several hours then lasts for up to two weeks. As with any self tanner, your results will depend on other factors like how often you exfoliate (or shave your legs) during this time.&lt;br /&gt;While this worked great on my face as far as color, I am using the L&#x27;Oreal serum mostly on my body (legs in particular) for its longevity. Because I use so many other products on my face, the tan did not last quite as long so I have been using a Jergens self tanning foam instead. While I need to reapply the Jergens more often, it seems a waste to use the longer lasting L&#x27;Oreal on my face but your own personal results will vary.&lt;br /&gt;But I really like this new L&#x27;Oreal tanning serum and will continue using it throughout the summer.</li>
    <li> I have a pretty decent tan after 3 days of application, and 1 week of waiting.  This is a powerful self tanner!  I would be careful not to apply too much to any given area of your face or it will streak.  But it does work.  If you have any dark spots (sunspots) on your face they will really stand out, so I would avoid that area, or the entire face if necessary.  This goes for any self-tanner.  My dark spots and dry spots on my face just get annoyingly visible.  If you have clear skin - go for it - you are indeed blessed!  I tend to want a face tan, because it makes my smile look better, so the only thing I can do is to mask those dark spots.  As I said, this goes for ANY self-tanner.  It does go on gooey, but it also dries fast.  I have streaks on my forehead, and I think it is because I didn&#x27;t use much care in applying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you want a deep tan without the sun?  Go for it?  Warnings aside, this is the quickest tan I have ever had from a bottle!</li>
    <li> I have used a variety of different self-tanners, and I do like this brand. However, it&#x27;s best for touch-ups and not for a full-body tan. For instance, I am a cyclist, and I like to use this product to even out the areas my bike shorts and top cover when I go to the beach or the pool. If you need a full-body tan, you&#x27;re better off going to a spray tan booth because it&#x27;s very difficult to get an even tan all over without streaking or making your hands and feet look strange. The tan lasts several days, but as it fades it tends to look spotty. Also, you get still get that self-tanner smell initially, so apply it on a day when you don&#x27;t have to go out anywhere.</li>
    <li> Works wonders I only applied this 2 times and I was already noticing a difference very happy with the results</li>
    <li> I really like the consistency and the color is nice and even.  This applied nicely and didn&#x27;t smell horrible.</li>
    <li> I am day two of application, and so far the results are great! I have never used a self tanner before other than the Jergens tinted moisturizer, so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. I showered, dried off really well, and then applied based on other reviews I had read. I had thought about diluting with a lotion, but I am already pretty olive skinned, so I figured full strength wouldn&#x27;t hurt. I applied about 5 pumps to each leg, arm, midsection, back, and shoulders. I rubbed, rubbed, rubbed so that I wouldn&#x27;t streak, because this is sort of colorless and is hard to tell where you applied. It dried relatively quickly, and I love the scent - so sunless tanner baking smell. After 1 application, I could see a little color, and after 2 I am in love. It is a nice bronze color, not orange, and so far no streaks! YAY! I am going to do one more application tonight before bed so I can see how long the color lasts. Overall, I am extremely pleased. The bottle is pretty small, and after 2 applications I am guessing that I will get a total of 10 applications from it or so. Other than that, great product.</li>
    <li> Smooth natural looking color without the unpleasant smell that self-tanners usually have.  Just wish it were moisturizing, as well.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for three months now. The lotion is smooth and easy to apply despite the stupid bottle shape that falls over while you try to press the tiny pump. The color darkens over 24 hrs and is nice but the smell the next day is awful.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s expensive for the very small bottle that fails to empty completely. I will change to another product as I tan my whole body.</li>
    <li> I am very fair complected.  I do go to the tanning bed a little just to get rid of the dead color (I’m so white my legs will be kind of purplish blue with no tan at all).  I was interested in trying this product to enhance the little tan I get from the tanning bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. I like the gel formula.  It goes on smooth and evenly with very little work.&lt;br /&gt;2. The price is reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;3. It seems to “tan” evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. I found it to have a very strong “fake tan” smell a few hours after application.&lt;br /&gt;2. I had some trouble with knees and ankles looking orange.&lt;br /&gt;3. It takes multiple applications to really notice a difference.  This is good and bad, but for me it’s bad because I tend to forget to use it day after day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it’s not a bad product at all.  The only star I dinged was for the smell.  It was very strong and a major con for me.</li>
    <li> I love self tanners...I normally use expensive self tanning cloths that also exfoliate.  However...this serum was a total surprise!  It has no discernible scent..it is light and not oily so I have not had any issues with that and I love the glow that this serum is giving to my face...I truly totally love it.  I have been using it in the mornings...every other day...I have medium warm skin anyway and this gives me a nice healthy  tanlike glow.  It has not been orange...it does not look fake at all and again...I love the feel of this light serum!</li>
    <li> This does not seem to work as well as the lotion. All it has done is make my brown spots on my skin darker.</li>
    <li> This is by far my new favorite of the L&#x27;oreal Sublime collection.  This is easy to apply without streaking.  It blends easily and was dry with a few moments.  I use the body wipes, the lotion and the gel throughout the year depending on what is available at the time.  The wipes are my usual go to because they are quick and simple, with no streak.  This serum feels rich and definitely moisturizes as well as providing a nice even healthy glow.</li>
    <li> I am a self tanner fiend and I love this product. It is a serum so goes on sort of wetter than the tanner I am used to but it soaks in and moisturises.  It has just the barest hint of gleam...not shimmer or glittery mind you, just a little sheen. It gave me a wonderful glow without being streaky or smelling like the telltale tanner.  I even used it on my face too and was very pleased.  L&amp;#34;Oreal did it again with this great product at a reasonable price.  This bottle should last me all summer.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way. Good smelling, slide on in more of a gel like substance then a lotion. No streaking if rubbed in really well and leaves you with a nice tan. It looks really good with my skin, no orange. So easy to use and apply.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff doesn&#x27;t rub off if you sit down or runs in the shower it&#x27;ll come off after the when your drying yourself</li>
    <li> I like this product (not love).  I am fair skinned and the color it gives is slightly orange, but I found if I apply it sparingly that it doesn&#x27;t look too bad.  Be careful around your knees and ankles it can really streak if you are not careful.</li>
    <li> When I first ordered this as part of the Vine program, I had mistakenly thought that it was just for the face since it&#x27;s called a \\&quot;serum.\\&quot;  It is, however, intended for full-body use, and the concentrated nature of this makes it different from other self-tanners I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This goes on really smoothly, and leaves a slight sheen to your skin, which is nice so you can see where you&#x27;ve applied it.  I&#x27;ve only used it for one day, but already a nice glow is developing - and my skin doesn&#x27;t have an orange Oompa Loompa look to it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When applying self-tanner, always be sure to thoroughly exfoliate your skin beforehand.  I also apply a very light layer of lotion around my knees, elbows, and feet to avoid darker spots.  It also helps to use a mitt; I use an inexpensive one that I can rinse and re-use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have that self-tanner smell from the DHA that all of them have, but it&#x27;s not as bad as others I&#x27;ve used, and it doesn&#x27;t linger too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I&#x27;m pretty fair (I wear MAC foundation in NW20 and Bare Essentials in Fairly Light), I&#x27;ve found that the medium color in self-tanners gives a better glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really like this and will be sure to update it as I use it three days in a row.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this product for my face. It enhances my wrinkles. Doesn&#x27;t work well on my legs either. Dark and light spots because I didn&#x27;t spread it even enough. I would not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I do like the product. However, you have to be very careful when you apply. My arms were fine but I had streak marks on one of my legs even though I meticulously tried to cover each area with the same amount and made sure to rub it in. I am now combining this with lotion which lowers the strength but is easier to apply. Be sure to wash your hands afterwards or they will stain.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week. This is the best tan I have ever had. The color looks natural and seems to be long lasting.</li>
    <li> Here is what I really like about this product:&lt;br /&gt;1. It&#x27;s nice scent. All the other self-tanners I have tried smell like the liquid that comes out of a festering wound. However, this L&#x27;Oreal product actually has a very pleasant odor and the scent fades rapidly After all, nobody wants their scent to announce that they are self-tanning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Color is very naturally looking and easy to control. I tested this product over a few days on skin that hasn&#x27;t seen daylight since 1997. I have very fair skin  and the medium tanning serum adjusted to give me just the right amount of tan.  Also, it leaves none of that orange glow. Tan looks naturally, well, tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Easy to apply evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes:&lt;br /&gt;1. I recommend exfoliating, shaving and moisturizing before using this product. I like doing this either the day or at least 12 hours before.&lt;br /&gt;2. Human error in applying any product is apparent. Although this serum goes on much more evenly than other products I have tried,you can still see where I stopped applying or missed a spot. Just be thorough and apply lightly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a number of different self-tanners this summer, mostly on my legs.  I have quite the &#x27;farmer&#x27;s tan&#x27; from all the gardening I do and wanted my legs to be as tan as the rest of me when I wear a skirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found almost all of them to work the same, with the main difference being how dark they tan you and the price.  I&#x27;ve seen some tanners go for over fifty dollars which I just don&#x27;t understand. The ingredient that gets your skin to tan is Dihydroxyacetone no matter what you&#x27;re paying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tanner is a Medium, which is my preferred tanning level. The light ones are too light for my skin tone and medium is just perfect.  I really recommend that you buy a tanning mitt.  I used my hand originally and ended up getting streaks. The tanning mitt helps you get the tanner on in a nice even way. Go lighter on your ankles, knees, elbows, etc. as they seem to take up more color. The color will show up by the next day, so be patient. If you want your tan to last longer, use the tanner a few days in a row. The color is nice and does match the rest of my tan pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tanning serum works just as well as the more expensive brands for a great price. Recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of different bronzers and they keep getting significantly better every few years.  This one is probably the best I&#x27;ve found so far.  It&#x27;s a gel so it goes on really evenly making it easier to avoid streaks.  Like most good bronzers you need to use it for at least three days to get a build up of color, but I really like that it doesn&#x27;t come on too strong too quickly.  Nothing looks more fake than going from pale to George Hamilton (does anybody remember him?) overnight.  The color comes on very gradually with this and seems to look more natural than many of the others I&#x27;ve used.  Three days is enough color for me so then I skip a few days and get into a routine of one or two days on and one or two days off.  This seems to hold it at the perfect level of light-tan for me... if you use it everyday it just keeps getting more intense and less natural looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it mostly on my legs so they don&#x27;t look so shockingly white when I wear a skirt so my only complaint is that I wish it came in a bigger bottle!</li>
    <li> In a climate where sun is a luxury and tanning beds are a luxury you can&#x27;t afford, this product becomes invaluable. I can afford to have lines because they are easily blended with the bronzer. I wouldn&#x27;t use this as an all-over tanner, but to erase tan lines it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> This product has a very strong, unpleasant odor. It also doesn&#x27;t give much color. I won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> I use this serum on my face and neck -- for everywhere else, I use the Sublime Bronze spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that the tan color matches between this serum and the spray (they&#x27;re both L&#x27;Oreal, so not surprising).  The serum actually colors better and more efficiently than the spray -- there&#x27;s little or no wasted product, versus the spray, which is easier to apply evenly to awkward areas, but ends up with a large amount of product on the floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fair skin, and I don&#x27;t need 3 consecutive days for this to look like a nice, light natural color -- I&#x27;d say two days is almost always just right.  I reapply (once) after about 3 days, or if I swim, exfoliate, sweat a lot, etc.  I like that it isn&#x27;t too much, too soon -- easier to correct minor mistakes (uneven application or skipped spots).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would DEFINITELY get a pair of latex or vinyl gloved to apply this, however!  It will stain your hands (hard to wash it ALL off, it always ends up somewhere), and also, you&#x27;ll waste a lot when it soaks into the skin on your hands.  With gloves, it almost all goes right into your skin, nothing wasted.  I think gloves help to apply it more evenly, too.</li>
    <li> This is great for face and neck. Feels greasy at first but dries quick and made my skin very soft (I have dry skin). The smell is not to bad, better than many others. I have used the lotions and sprays and don&#x27;t like them, but this serum is really nice for small areas. I&#x27;m glad I tried this.</li>
    <li> This does go on very easily and it does not streak.  Another huge factor is that is does not stink--most of these products have an awful scent that doesn&#x27;t go away.  It just does not provide much of a difference.  I know I put it on and even I have to look closely to see a difference.  The difference is very subtle.</li>
    <li> I really like this, it goes on like any other serum and it gradually tans your face. You are supposed to apply it three days in a row and it should last two weeks but I like to use it 3 times a week spread out to maintain a slight tan. I like that it can be used with your regular skin care and that you wake up with a natural tan in the morning. Sometimes if I apply too much it can be a little dark but using a face scrub will even it all out. Really cool product for the face and neck!</li>
    <li> I am quite impressed with this bronzer. It is easy to apply, dries fairly quickly, does not readily streak or spot, and imparts an attractive, fairly deep tan after 3 days of application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your happiness with this or any other bronzer, depends on applying it properly. If you are not an experienced user, and do not follow basic instructions, you will get uneven, streaky results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a light (not fair) olive complexion and applying this product three days in a row gave me an even, natural looking, deep tan. Several days of vacation sun in a fairly small bottle aint&#x27;t bad! My legs and arms looked quite good. The tan was quite natural looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is a light amber gel with a nice citrus-y/bronzer aroma that lingers but does not offend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the benefits of a gel rather than a cream or lotion is that it dries fairly quickly...in about 5-10 minutes depending on the temperature and humidity of the room where it is being applied. One of the negatives of a liquid (as opposed to a gel or tinted cream or lotion) is that it can be difficult to know exactly where and how thickly the product has been applied. This gel was very easy to apply. It smoothed quickly and evenly over my skin and did not run or glop. It was relatively easy to see where and how it was applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing to do is make sure your body is prepared. Exfoliate in the shower or bath using a loofa or bath brush especially over rough patches or areas of dry skin. Use a pumice stone on your feet, knees, and elbows. After bathing, do not apply any oil based lotion to your body......except to your heels, knees, elbows, and palms and around the finger and toe nails. You do this so the product does not absorb more quickly into these areas and become darker than the rest of your body. I often use Vaseline on my palms, heels, knees, and elbows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standing in a private room that is not too hot or humid (or for that matter, cold) squirt 4 or 5 pumps of the gel into your hand.  Always starting with your feet and then working upward, start smoothing the gel on to your skin and gently even it out with circular motion. Make every effort to ensure that the gel is applied evenly. After applying the bronzer to your legs, arms, and body, apply a very thin coat of it to your neck and face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dampen a washcloth and lightly tap it on your knees, ankles, and heels to ensure that the product was not applied too heavily in those areas. Use a light hand when doing this, you don&#x27;t want to totally remove the product, just even it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wash your hands carefully with soap and water. Use a nail brush on your palms and around your nail beds. Make sure that water does not splash or drip down your arms while the product is still drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once the product has been satisfactorily applied, stand still until it dries. This is the hard part. Do not sit or bend your legs or arms during this time or the product will pool on the insides of your knees and elbows. Do not apply clothing, just stand somewhere fairly cool and dry for about 5-10 minutes. If you have to walk around, make sure not to lean or rub up against anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once the bronzer dries on your skin, it will not streak or rub off. It will not wash off either. It will wear off gradually like a natural tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tan from this product emerges several hours later. The manufacturer recommends applying it on 3 successive days for best results. If you want good results for a specific event, it&#x27;s best to start several days in advance.r feet and then working upward, start smoothing the gel on to your skin and gently even it out with circular motion.

    <li> Tried using this in different ways but each time it ended up being streaky and quite orange. Going back to st moriz</li>
    <li> This is a good fake tan.  It is not orange &amp; seems to last about 7 days on my skin which is better than others I&#x27;ve tried - your results may be different.  You need to prep your skin prior to using for good results.  Shave, scrub/exfoliate, wash with soap, rinse &amp; fully dry skin before using.  I use plain old sugar as my scrub in combination with soap.  This works well for exfoliating, is cheap &amp; doesn&#x27;t hurt the environment with plastic beads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this serum version because it really seems to absorb better than the lotion versions with less rubbing &amp; it&#x27;s not messy like a spray.  Don&#x27;t apply too heavy &amp; work slowly/methodically to cover your skin evenly.  Wash your hands with soap &amp; water immediately after finishing.  I usually use my sugar scrub method with soap.  Let this dry completely on your skin before getting dressed.  This dries quickly &amp; doesn’t feel heavy like lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fair skin that tans easily &amp; I had a little bit of color already.  I only needed it 2 days in a row to get a good medium/light tan.</li>
    <li> This product works as advertised. I applied it for 3 days and kept my tan-look for 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> This is a great tanner and relatively inexpensive.  It goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t have an odor that I noticed.  I haven&#x27;t used the entire bottle yet so I am not sure how long it will last, but it depends on your frequency and how much skin you want to use it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color looked very good on my skin, not orange at all.  The color lasted for almost two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kind of tanning is much better for your skin than the real thing.  Give it a try and see how you like it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many self tanners, including the high end brands and I have to rate this one up there with the best.  First it is a serum and so the consistency is different than any other self tanner I&#x27;ve tried.  It glides on and has a more pleasant smell than most self tanners and it doesn&#x27;t linger.  It dries fairly quickly and leaves your skin looking soft and radiant.  The color turns over a few hours and the medium is perfect for my skin.  The color is nice too.  One coat and I looked like I had a nice even tan.  As always be careful applying to heels, toes,fingers and elbows.  I always go back over these areas, after I&#x27;ve applied self tanner with a damp face clothe and just brush them light so the formula doesn&#x27;t take too deeply in these areas..  I&#x27;ve also found a way to rid myself of any self tanner on my palms, by using a mixture of Bon Ami with liquid hand soap and gently exfoliate the palms after using any self tanner, that doesn&#x27;t require a mitt.  This method leaves your palms free of self tanning stain.</li>
    <li> Great fragrance, goes on smoothly, no orange &amp;#34;fake and bake&amp;#34; look, and I love that you can build up to the tone you want over several days instead of going too far with one application. The color develops slowly, so some patience is required. In other words, no need to reapply if you&#x27;re not seeing color in minutes. Wait a day then reapply if desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As other reviewers pointed out, gloves are a good idea so you don&#x27;t accidentally tan your palms. And do extra rubbing to make sure it&#x27;s evenly applied, and not too heavy on the knees and elbows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great natural looking results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of self-tanner and the L&#x27;Oreal single use sheets are my favorite, mainly because they work with my light skin tone, dry fast and the color last a few days. I was excited to try this one as it claims the color will last 2 weeks if applied every day for 3 days. Their test subjects must not have showered much because this didn&#x27;t last nearly as long on me. In fact, I&#x27;d say the sheets lasted longer and achieved a more uniform tan and glow than this serum did. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, because I LIKED it, and I think that, compared to more expensive brands out there, L&#x27;Oreal does a great job with this, just don&#x27;t expect 2 weeks out of it. The smell was the typical self-tanner smell. I did use it on my face and, while it made me a bit oily, it didn&#x27;t make me break out and gave a nice glow.</li>
    <li> Not that overpowering orange we all are used to seeing from self tanning products.  It is a gradual color difference that deepens over time so do not use too much right away.  It goes on very nice and is easy to apply evenly.  The odor is pleasant and goes away in an hour or so for the most part.  Since I don&#x27;t like a dark tan, just a sun kissed look, a single application worked great.  The color seems to last a week or so before needing to be applied again.  My only gripe is that the bottle isn&#x27;t larger.  Based on how much I used the first and second time, I will need to get another bottle for my third application.  Overall, I am happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Very natural tanning lotion!!</li>
    <li> This stuff works.  I will not sunbathe, it looks real and works fast and easily.  Lots of compliments on my tan. Gradual and natural look! Just follow directions!</li>
    <li> Finally a great self tanner! Perfect color and dries fast. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> My daughter likes fake tanner and was excited to try this product. She&#x27;s used mousses and lotions before, but never a serum. She exfoliated and shaved before applying, and used it for two days on her arms, legs, face and neck. She liked that it gave a nice medium tan color to her skin without being too orangey. I thought it looked a little more orange than some of the other products she&#x27;s tried. The tan lasted about three days without extra applications, and faded without streaks or spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She liked the consistency of the serum, and said it smoothed on and soaked in nicely. She didn&#x27;t wash her hands well enough after applying and did have some orange around her nails and palms, so be sure to scrub it off knees, elbows and hands before it sets. Another reviewer mentioned using rubber gloves to apply, and that worked better with less waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price ($6.77 as of the time I&#x27;m writing this review), this is a very nice product for less cost than some of the others she&#x27;s tried.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long as I expected nor does it make me as dark as it&#x27;s spray on counter part.  I&#x27;m going back to the spray on tanner from Loreal that I was using before.</li>
    <li> Good product--dries quickly and begins to &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; within a few hours.  The color is a bit orange-y but it&#x27;s not bad.  I find self-tanners messy and inconvenient to use.  I much prefer the old-fashioned way to tan (the SUN or a tanning bed) but I stopped using both years ago due to the risk of skin cancer.  As self-tanners go, this is one of the best.</li>
    <li> I have found this product to work great. I would definitely recommend exfoliating and applying lotion before using, as this helps it to go on smoothly and evenly. I use about 3 pumps for each leg, to cover from foot to just past the knee, and another 2-3 pumps for each thigh. I have not tried this on my face or arms or anywhere else.</li>
    <li> The gelee version of the Sublime Bronze tanner was my favorite for years, but now I like this serum version better. It dries quicker, not as sticky. Hardly has any detectable smell.</li>
    <li> Oh no! I was so hoping to love this. I am a redhead with pale skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the color of the  sublime &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; from loreal, but hate the way it goes on. It globs up, streaks, and fades in patches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping this would give me the same color with an easier application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say the application was nice!! It dried so quickly! I never feel comfortable enough to sleep in self tanners, but this was no problem!  There was no color guard, and it does dry so quickly I would not recommend for beginners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I woke the next day and oh my god! So so so orange! I have never been so embarrassed! I had to meet a friend for a birthday brunch and I wanted to die. Spent the rest of the day in hiding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today is day two. I scrubbed with a body brush AND exfoliated with a body scrub. Still so orange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cannot wait for this to fade! Really hope it doesn&#x27;t take two weeks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are like me, you&#x27;ll want to try it for yourself - even with bad reviews. And I get that. I even support it. Maybe this color would look good on your skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides the color, everything else was great. Easy application. Fast drying. DHA smell was not as bad as others I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;m so disappointed in the color. Really wanted to love it.  But way too orange for me!!</li>
    <li> Love this bronzer.  Very natural color.  I use for face and neck/chest area.</li>
    <li> I love this sell tanning serum. It looks natural and the results last a couple of woks. I will be purchasing more before I run out of it, and definitely recommend to everyone who is avoiding the sun for whatever reasons.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very fair, which I&#x27;m OK with for the most part, but going bare legged in the warmer months is really just painful. Fair skin is really pretty, but there&#x27;s no way white legs work in warm weather. I like to try self tanners to see if I can warm them up to, say, the shade of paper (yes, I&#x27;m really that white.) I&#x27;ve tried L&#x27;Oreal tanning products before, and they were as OK as any others. This one is a noticeable improvement. The color development is relatively quick, and wonder of wonders, the orange afterglow is really a true minimum! (There is one thing worse than white legs, and that&#x27;s white legs with an orange cast from bad self tanners.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like others, I mixed this with a moisturizer to level out the orange factor and to give my skin a moisture boost. I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m blown away, but it&#x27;s really not bad at all. It also helps that my legs are far enough away from my eyes that I can&#x27;t be THAT critical (distance is your friend with self tanners!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it. I&#x27;m still on the hunt for the perfect self tanner, but until I find it, this will more than do.</li>
    <li> I have used many different self tanners.  This product is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  Honestly I use it mostly on my face.  I have not experienced any burning or stinging.  It goes on smooth and then disappears, meaning I can&#x27;t feel any residue or stickiness.  It tries very quickly and then I apply my normal moisturizer.  It doesn&#x27;t sink into your pores or streak.  I absolutely love it.  I have tried it on my arms and legs though not to the extent that I&#x27;ve used it on my face.  I have had the same success so far on my arms and legs.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with this self-tanner!  I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, because the last time I used one I was young and ended up with orange knees, haha.  But I followed the directions to the T and my legs just look AMAZING right now.  I am confident enough to go out in public without any sort of stockings on.  GREAT product. I will definitely buy more!</li>
    <li> This stuff works great and the tan can last up to two weeks on areas like arms and legs.  Even though it is a small bottle I was able to get 4 full body tans. For reference I am 5&#x27;7&amp;#34; tall.</li>
    <li> I really do like this product.  I mix several pumps of it into my body lotion and facial moisturizer, and I get complimented on my tan all the time.  I used to use the Sublime Bronze Gelee the same way, also religiously, but it smelled much worse, was more prone to streaking, and did not mix as well with lotion.  This stuff is just a great tanning serum, with hardly any smell and a very natural color.  I only wish it either came in a bigger bottle or was more concentrated/darker.  I have to use quite a bit to achieve a good color all over.  I go through almost a bottle a week, and it is not cheap.  They do not appear to offer a Medium-Deep color like they do of the gel, and I wish that they would, so I wouldn&#x27;t have to use so much.</li>
