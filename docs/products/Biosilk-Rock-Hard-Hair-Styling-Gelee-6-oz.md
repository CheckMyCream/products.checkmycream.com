    <li> Holds my fine curly hair really well. I only need to use a small amount of gel</li>
    <li> This is a great gel that keeps your curls soft and firm. It does not leave you with that wet, crunchy look that some gels do. It also does a great job of preventing frizz.</li>
    <li> Love this product, gave one to my dermatologist. He loves it. The gel is great. Give a new slick look and doesn&#x27;t flake unless you mess with your hairstyle otherwise I use it all the time and people are always asking me what I use to make my hair style so slick and sharp looking. This is the product I recommend to them. Great stuff. I wish I could stop using it but it works so good and haven&#x27;t found anything else that works as well as Biosilk Rock Hard.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a long time, so it&#x27;s the same as always.</li>
    <li> CAN&#x27;T DO MY HAIR WITHOUT IT</li>
    <li> I recieved the &amp;#34;new look&amp;#34; ....&amp;#34;same great formula&amp;#34;.  The New look is in a tub now and is hard to get the product out - not good.  The &amp;#34;same great formula&amp;#34; now looks like pond scum (yellowish thick - ugly - it used to be clear) and had an perfume smell (that I do NOT like).  It is thicker (almost  Sticky/ gooey) and the &amp;#34;same formula&amp;#34; seems to not perform as well as the last one.  Overall, I have no issues with the shipping, but not sure I will buy this again (and I have purchased this product for 7 years now).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and it&#x27;s become more difficult to find in various stores. I like it because it doesn&#x27;t flake all up like other gels and has a really firm hold! Plus, I get it cheaper ordering it through Amazon.com!!</li>
    <li> I like this product because it dries well .It does NOT leave white glue when the is  hair is dry.&lt;br /&gt;It keeps my un-wanted fuzz hair in place all day when I make a Pony tail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking to spike hair, this is NOT  for you.</li>
    <li> I use the Rock Hard Gelee Firm hold to spike up my short hair. This product doe not leave a powder look after it is dry. I would recommend it to boys and girls that want the spike hairstyles.</li>
    <li> My fav hair gel. Any styles I want it helps me a lot!</li>
    <li> Love it. Works good on my hair style.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years and have found it to excellent.</li>
    <li> My favorite hair gel of all-time.  With only a little amount, the gel holds up my thin and fine hair throughout the day.  No flakes, no greasiness.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I have had good luck with this product holding my curl. It has a nice light fragrance as well.</li>
    <li> I tried 6 products and this is the one!  Just right........</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite gel for curling hair !!!  I can&#x27;t believe they discontinued it!</li>
    <li> This is great hold like glue!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for YEARS.. It holds a spiked hairdo UP  and it is never gummy......refreshes the next day with water!  One thing I did note about this particular tube---it is EXTREMELY thick---much thicker than the last half a dozen tubes I have purchased.  I had to thoroughly wet my hands and liquefy the gel before using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have no idea if the formula has changed or the product was subjected to severe temperature changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**1/6/2016**&lt;br /&gt;Just got another tube of gelee&#x27;. At first I thought I was sent the wrong thing!!!  LOVE the new packaging and the product is still the BEST on the market!</li>
    <li> Good product for fine, flyaway hair.  I have short hair, and this helps keep a style in place all day.</li>
    <li> Great stuff -- excellent quality.</li>
    <li> GREAT HOLD AND MAKES YOU HAIR SHINE.</li>
    <li> Great product....and a great price.&lt;br /&gt;Have been using this for several years....a little dab goes a long way</li>
    <li> Awesome product!!! Love this stuff!!!&lt;br /&gt;Will always use this Biosilk, its all what it says in it&#x27;s name . Very satisfied .</li>
    <li> This is the only hair gel product that my husband has used for well over 10 years.  It works for him.  He likes it.  So, there is no need to change.  Enough said.</li>
    <li> Spilled all over and dried to the container pre-arrival, it&#x27;s much stickier than when I purchase it at the store... I&#x27;m pretty sure this has been sitting on the shelf for a while.</li>
    <li> I love Rock Hard Gelee!!!!</li>
