      <li>I like fresh, citrus types of perfumes this is not a fresh smell,</li>
      <li>This product was introduced to me when I was sixteen years old back in 1981.</li>
      <li>It smelled like it was old, has been on the shelf too long.  </li>

    <li> I love Pheromone, and use it everyday.  I try to switch but there is something about this haunting fragrance that lingers and I just do not want to use anything else.  It probably is not for everybody.  But, for strong personalities and for those who wish they were, this just might be the one for you!</li>
    <li> This product was introduced to me when I was sixteen years old back in 1981. I remember Saks Fifth Avenue being the only store selling the product at that time.&lt;br /&gt;I would always go in and get a samples of Pheromone from the perfume ladies because I could not afford it for a long time. Several years later, I was able to buy the whole&lt;br /&gt;gift set. The smell of the perfume is very beautiful and very unique!!!!!  Robin</li>
    <li> Nice ..long and lasting for all day..do know if good for kids.my son 2 years old always followed me when I 1st time use..</li>
    <li> Warm and inviting on any woman. My wife loves it too.</li>
    <li> Have bought this before in larger oz/bottle and the fragrance(smell) lasted longer, this 1oz does not last over an hour have timed it with my family testing for me, before got compliments from people didn&#x27;t know would come up and ask what perfume do u have on! It is not as potent as the first bottle I ordered, that was what I loved.</li>
    <li> Smells OK, nothing to die for. I have tried better. Dont  think it works, only the delivery man is only one knocking on my door, even before I bought this. Lol. Everybody has different chemestry, maybe it doesn&#x27;t work with mine. This is something you have to try on your own to see if it works for you and you like it. For me, didn&#x27;t work, dont care much how it smells.</li>
    <li> THIS IS GREAT. LOVE LOVE LOVE IT. everyone asks what fragrance I&#x27;m wearing. Just get rave reviews about this scent</li>
    <li> It smelled like it was old, has been on the shelf too long.  Will not buy again</li>
    <li> A beautiful thing happened three years ago when I first purchased his fragrance.. I wanted to make sure that I wasn&#x27;t mistaken, so I purchased it again and gave it another go. Yup, it worked again. I can honestly say he is sprung. Thank  you Pheromone</li>
    <li> It is what my girlfriend wanted. Need I say more? She has always loved it!</li>
    <li> This fragrance wes one of my mother&#x27;s favorite scents. I wanted to purchase a bottle to remember the wonder fragrance again. It came in just a few days and the container is beautiful. I would purchase it again.</li>
