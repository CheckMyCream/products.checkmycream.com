      <li>I have sensitive skin and have had no problems using it.</li>
      <li>I got one shade darker than what I normally buy because their shade of light is very pale even for me.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m actually a little surprised how much is NOT rubbing off.</li>

<li> I have acne as well as dry flakes, and it covered the former without highlighting the latter.</li>
<li> My other, more expensive make-up was close to gone by noon.</li>

<li> It is not too thick or oily and it stays onost of the day.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s thick</li>
<li> It would work for me in summer when I&#x27;ve got a bit of color but not in the winter when I&#x27;m especially pale.  </li>
<li> For example, I have a sinus infection and cold</li>

    <li> I love elf!!! This is my favorite foundation!! I have fair skin and freckles....I use the color &amp;#34;sand&amp;#34; for me it is full coverage and matches my skin well and doesn&#x27;t make me break out!!</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t use any other foundation. Covers up my old acne scars and lasts all day. Works wells with ELF stipple brush</li>
    <li> This foundation has amazing coverage for an amazing price. It lasts long and doesn&#x27;t wear off throughout the day. Almost all elf products have worked amazingly for me, there is an occasional miss although my makeup drawers are almost completely full with ELF. This makeup is comparable to MAC studio fix.</li>
    <li> I really like this product and will by it again.</li>
    <li> Best foundation I&#x27;ve possibly ever used.  I&#x27;m hooked.  I think I could have used a little darker shade however so will order that next time.</li>
    <li> For the price it is great. It is not too thick or oily and it stays onost of the day. I bought almost all of the colors because i am a mua. It pretty kuch works great on everyone i have used them on and the colors seem true to the color swatch. I am a natural brunette with light eyes and pale skin, noe i have blond hair and like to look just a little darker so i use the sand color and it looks very natural.</li>
    <li> This is a great foundation! I have sensitive skin and have had no problems using it. A great balance, not drying and not greasy.</li>
    <li> I mix this product with my Neutrogena Sport Face 70 spf, as I&#x27;m not looking for a lot of color coverage.  This is my second time purchasing the e.l.f flawless finish foundation and I would recommend.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice foundation, for the money and for your skin. It gives you medium coverage with a flawless, semi matte finish. I have acne as well as dry flakes, and it covered the former without highlighting the latter. The porcelain shade is excellent for pale skin.</li>
    <li> My favorite foundation,  and it is one of the few I can use bc it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or break me out and the coverage is phenomenal!</li>
    <li> I read the comments on this make-up before purchasing and I will be honest that I was hesitant. It was pretty cheap compared to competitors (I used Revlon Colorstay in the past - $10 each). I read where folks said the color was off also. But, for me, I can&#x27;t see where any of the negative comments come in. This make-up goes on very smooth and covers up flaws nicely. It is oil free, but does have a little shine to it, as does any foundation when you first apply. Cover it up with a nice translucent powder and you&#x27;re all set. It comes in a pump, so you pump out a little on your make-up pad (what I use) and smooth over your skin. My skin is not as oily throughout the day while wearing this also (I have extremely oily skin). This color is sand which is exactly the color I used with other products and it matched perfectly. It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on my skin and it stays on well throughout the day. For example, I have a sinus infection and cold so I am forever blowing my nose... and understandibly some will smear off, but not much and I&#x27;m not walking around looking like rudolph the red-nosed reindeer!! I&#x27;m actually a little surprised how much is NOT rubbing off. I figured it would be all gone by the end of the day at the rate I am going. My other, more expensive make-up was close to gone by noon. Not to mention, all of ELF products are cruelty free and this is VERY important for me (no one should suffer for my &amp;#34;beauty&amp;#34;). I love all of their make-up and for me - it was better than expected and I&#x27;m a future customer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with anything, each person is different and has different needs and shades, but for me - this was perfect! I highly recommend making sure the color you get is comparable to what you&#x27;ve used in the past. If you can do that, you should be pleasantly surprised with this foundation! I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> As everyone else stated, the product is a little darker than pictured.  I bought sand because I have pale skin with yellow undertones. It would work for me in summer when I&#x27;ve got a bit of color but not in the winter when I&#x27;m especially pale.  That being said, it doesn&#x27;t look completely unnatural.  One of the biggest difficulties for me as a pale person as that the pale shades tend to have a pink undertone that looks completely wrong on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say that this is a medium coverage foundation but you could make it heavier or lighter by varying application.  I used it with an ELF primer and it lasted all day with no greasiness. If you can find a shade in your skin tone and department store brands are out of your price range, this is a good option for everyday wear.</li>
    <li> I truly love ELF. This is the second time I&#x27;ve bought this foundation and it&#x27;s great. Covers well but doesn&#x27;t give me that caked makeup look.  I have very porcelain complexion but bought sand. I got one shade darker than what I normally buy because their shade of light is very pale even for me. I never break out and what makes this a fantastic product is its cruelty free!</li>
    <li> accidentally got it in a shade darker than I am so I look like Jersey Shore almost but its flawless makeup! best coverage I&#x27;ve found in the cheap side of makeup. I went &amp; bought the right color off the website.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because it was incredibly cheap and well, I need a new foundation and wanted to see if this one was as good as my previous one. Before I put it on my face, I really liked it. It felt really creamy and it was a color that matched my ski tone pretty well. I put it on, and after a couple of hours, I was a greasy mess, I know this foundation is not for oily skin, but I am just warning other people with oily skin like mine that I&lt;br /&gt;This is not the product for you.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s thick so I mix it with moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite foundation - and sooooo inexpensive compared to what I have used in the past.  It looks great all day and does a nice job of covering imperfections but looks natural at the same time.</li>
