      <li>so i&#x27;m glad i found this great bargain!</li>
      <li>This shade is a perfect accent, and it meets my criteria of being easy to apply and of not clumping up.  </li>
      <li>I have used it on its own before, and it&#x27;s still a great product.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
      <li>Good coverage and primer like qualities.</li>
      <li>color good but application not so.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fairly neutral but a bit shimmery</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really good considering the price.</li>
      <li>The best news of all, of course, is that it did in fact wear for a full twelve hours without creasing or fading when I tested it.  </li>
      <li>It works very nicely on the cheeks (if you use a very light hand) as a highlighter.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I wish they had more colors!</li>
      <li>Love this color get lots of complements on it!</li>
      <li>I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and the color payoff is great.</li>
      <li>My skin is a medium light and this color is great for me.</li>
      <li>This stuff is AMAZING as an eyeshadow primer.</li>
      <li>Totally loving this...</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s own if you don&#x27;t want to use it as a primer.</li>
      <li>This had sparkles in it or I would have liked it..</li>
      <li>I was hoping this would be a nice primer or just a shadow that I could use with liner and mascara for a polished look.</li>
      <li>I have the world&#x27;s oiliest eyelids and this is the kind of product I like to spend my money on.  </li>
      <li>Lasts through workouts, a nice plus.</li>
      <li>This eyeshadow is really nice.</li>
      <li>I have very fair skin and barely branded works great as a neutral eye color for work.</li>
      <li>Love this -  but if worn on its own it does have a sort of shimmer that I was not prepared for.</li>
      <li>The shimmer when it sheers out is nice, and what I liked more about it was that it sheered out evenly so it could be easily used as a wash of color for when youâ€™re pressed for time.</li>
      <li>I am betting though that this would be beautiful on people with much darker skin tones.  </li>
      <li>beautiful, but much lighter than it appeared in the picture on my computer</li>
      <li>I used this cream eye shadow for the first time and it looked great.</li>
      <li>Good, cool shimmer nude.</li>
      <li>I love Color Tattoo eyeshadows.</li>
      <li>Love color tattoo, not a fan of this color.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;i love to use it as an all over the lid color  with another color on the crease  </li>
      <li>and I haven&#x27;t been able to find it</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m glad to see that it&#x27;s on Amazon.</li>
      <li>That night I fell asleep with all my makeup still on and even the next day it looked perfect</li>
      <li>I love it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>love them.  </li>
      <li>I am planning to order more eyeshadow from this vendor.</li>
      <li>I think oily eyelids would benefit most.</li>
      <li>I love that it helps brighten my eyes</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve learned it&#x27;s best to buy these types of products locally</li>
      <li>I absolutely love love this color.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love this cream eyeshadow.</li>
      <li>I can go all day (8-10 hours) without having to worry about what is happening on my eyelids!  :)</li>
      <li>love this....</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>It adds a shimmer that isn&#x27;t over the top and stays in place all</li>
      <li>so it compliments many skin tones.</li>
      <li>Its an ok eyeshadow to use.</li>
      <li>I love the look</li>
      <li>Read about this in Glamour magazine....use it to lighten up my face on my cheeks, forehead, chin and top of my nose.</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re going for, it glides on smooth and lasts!</li>
      <li>I was looking for a more skin tone neutral primer for under eye shadow.</li>
      <li>Though it is shimmery, it is appropriate for day time and makes me look more awake.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t expect to look &amp;#34;barely branded,&amp;#34; more like, &amp;#34;extremely glittered.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love building on them.</li>
      <li>I found it makes an amazing primer, because as with all of the others, the consistency makes it perfect for holding other colors.</li>
      <li>This stuff works pretty good .</li>
      <li>It had a nice creamy consistency that made for quick and easy application, and it built up color</li>
      <li>where they can be returned easily with no shipping charges.</li>
      <li>It stays on and doesn&#x27;t just rub off easily.</li>
      <li>The product got here very quickly.</li>
      <li>easy, though being a cream, had to dedicate a brush to it&lt;br /&gt;Appearance:</li>
      <li>I am 35 and do not wear a whole lot of color on my eyes so this skin tone with some shimmer is nice.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a light neutral color with quite a bit of shimmer.</li>
      <li>A great long-wear shadow that actually does what it claims to do--last!!</li>
      <li>Great eye shadow, I have never used gel eye shadow, so I have some questions on this product, turns out its great, long lasting and</li>
      <li>Barely Branded is more of a nude color and that&#x27;s why I love it.</li>
      <li>The only way this eyeshadow comes off is with makeup remover, which is a good thing in my book.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re in a hurry this is a nice shade to put on as a natural look.</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t take your makeup off at night (don&#x27;t judge), and wake up after a full night&#x27;s rest, it&#x27;s still there.</li>
      <li>It came fast and the presentation was cute sweet.</li>
      <li>Barely braded is a warm, creamy beige with a frosted, metallic finish.</li>
      <li>It lasts all day long even if I have sports practice and that is pretty amazing because eyeshadow creases most of the time almost immediately on</li>
      <li>This eye shadow is very pretty.  </li>
      <li>I use barely branded on its own on days I don&#x27;t feel like doing a lot of makeup or as a primer when I do.</li>
      <li>Still a very pretty shade, just not a flattering texture for me.</li>
      <li>It would be great under any other color as well!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Don&#x27;t really use it as eye shadow, but instead a eye shadow primer - it works very well - keeps colors on all day, and provides a neutral base so the colors really pop. Great investment.</li>
    <li> Was diappointed--it rather clumps going on. color good but application not so.</li>
    <li> Love this color get lots of complements on it!</li>
    <li> Great for a primer! Eye shadow stays on all day</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to try these eyeshadows, but they are amazing.  I absolutely love love this color.  It&#x27;s fairly neutral but a bit shimmery so it&#x27;s great for day OR night.  It really stays put and doesn&#x27;t move. The only way this eyeshadow comes off is with makeup remover, which is a good thing in my book.  I have the world&#x27;s oiliest eyelids and this is the kind of product I like to spend my money on.  It&#x27;s worth the price, and amazon has it a little cheaper than usual so it&#x27;s a deal.</li>
    <li> I wear this has an everyday brow bone highlighter. A little goes a long way so dont overdo it. I think its perfect to accentuate. It literally does stay all day too.</li>
    <li> Great product! I use this as a base almost daily. It holds my shadow in place ALL DAY without creasing or fading. I have used it on its own before, and it&#x27;s still a great product. I also use it for a brow/inner corner highlight often. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I love Color Tattoo eyeshadows. This has been my favorite color so far. I like that I can apply one coat to keep it subtle for when I do a thicker eyeliner line, or I can layer it to make it stand out more. It would be great under any other color as well!</li>
    <li> Love this -  but if worn on its own it does have a sort of shimmer that I was not prepared for. I was looking for a more skin tone neutral primer for under eye shadow. It is pretty - just not exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Great base shadow for any eye. Really love using it all be the lid for a base</li>
    <li> This eyeshadow is really nice. The color is really pretty. You can wear it alone or as a base for other other shadows. A lot of times I&#x27;ll wear this and then put a darker color in the crease and I&#x27;m good to go. I&#x27;ve had this for a year now, use it constantly as a base or alone, and I only have a small dent in it. It has great staying power and the Color Tattoo line has a lot of gorgeous eyeshadow shades(I have 5!). If and when I ever run out of this, I will repurchase this!</li>
    <li> The product is not a matte/one tone color tattoo shadow. I assumed it was similar to the &#x27;Just Beige&#x27; color I wanted, but this one has shimmer--which isn&#x27;t bad! Just an FYI for those who thought the same thing I did.</li>
    <li> This does what you&#x27;d expect. It&#x27;s a light neutral color with quite a bit of shimmer.It can be a little messy, but is easy to apply (no globs).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it as a brightener before applying eye shadow. It doesn&#x27;t create creases in my eye shadow halfway through the day like some other cream bases do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I use it as a primer for my powder shadow. If I don&#x27;t use a powder overt the top to set it then it creases really bad. I like the look with regular shadow though and it works well for long wear.</li>
    <li> I use this as a primer and shadow. EVERYONE needs this!!! I literally use this everyday. You only need a little of this and it works so well!</li>
    <li> when i got married several years ago, i had my makeup done by MAC cosmeticians. this is pretty much the exact same product they used on me except much much cheaper. i use this as a primer and base for my entire lid (like they had done). it has a very subtle color to it so it compliments many skin tones. i like that there&#x27;s a little shimmer to it because it seems to brighten my eyes. makeup can get ridiculously expensive so i&#x27;m glad i found this great bargain!</li>
    <li> Great eye shadow, I have never used gel eye shadow, so I have some questions on this product, turns out its great, long lasting and the color is just perfect for the look I like. Great produc/price</li>
    <li> I own a few of these eyeshadows and this one is definitely my favorite. I bought this eyeshadow in the shade Barely Branded sometime last year and I&#x27;ve recently ran out of it. I went to Wal-Mart and Walgreens searching for it and I haven&#x27;t been able to find it so I&#x27;m glad to see that it&#x27;s on Amazon. Barely Branded is more of a nude color and that&#x27;s why I love it. I normally use this shade as a primer but it&#x27;s beautiful all on it&#x27;s own if you don&#x27;t want to use it as a primer. This eyeshadow definitely lasts for hours and I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is my second time purchasing this product. It&#x27;s a must have! You can use all over your lid, as a highlighter, and in your inner eye. Love it!</li>
    <li> Very dry and hard to apply.  I tried adding water but it didn&#x27;t help.  I&#x27;ve learned it&#x27;s best to buy these types of products locally where they can be returned easily with no shipping charges.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this cream eyeshadow. I&#x27;m Asian with slightly oily eyelids. I tested this product without a primer, and I had no creasing after an entire day. I have also tried using this as a primer and it works well, but I would only suggest using it as a primer if you are applying shimmery eyeshadow because it will cause matte shadows to glitter a little. The only thing you may have to be mindful of is that it is a VERY long lasting eyeshadow so taking it off is a hassle. I would recommend using a makeup remover that can remove stubborn waterproof mascara to remove this product. When I first got this product, I swatched it on the back of my hand, and even aggressive scrubbing and hand soap would not remove it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color payoff is also really great. You can take a small amount for a light wash of color or you can really build it to get a super pigmented effect. I like that you have that versatility with this cream shadow. I have been wearing this every day just for a wash of color on my lids. The color is fairly light, so it removes all the redness and darkness on my lids and give it a nice little sparkle without being inappropriate for work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, for the price of this product, it&#x27;s an absolute steal.</li>
    <li> The color tattoo eyeshadows last really long and I have pretty oily eyelids.&lt;br /&gt;In the last months I used the shade bad to the bronze and wanted to get other shades because I just love it! It lasts all day long even if I have sports practice and that is pretty amazing because eyeshadow creases most of the time almost immediately on me.&lt;br /&gt;Barely branded is a beautiful everyday color and perfect to only use the shade or to use it as base for other eyeshadows.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend the whole color tattoo range to everybody!</li>
    <li> Beautiful color. Doesn&#x27;t clump or sit in creases of my eye. Truly lasts 24 hours! I went out on the town one night wearing this as my base and highlighter. I fell asleep (without taking my makeup off, oops!) and it looked just as good when I woke up the next morning as it did when I first stepped out for the night. I highly recommend this product. (Use with a primer on your lid though).</li>
    <li> I have very fair skin and barely branded works great as a neutral eye color for work. Though it is shimmery, it is appropriate for day time and makes me look more awake. It does crease up a bit on me, but I&#x27;m not using a primer at all and I have yet to find any high shadow (including luxury brands) that don&#x27;t crease after several hours. It&#x27;s really good considering the price. It&#x27;s easy to apply and the color payoff is great.</li>
    <li> Read about this in Glamour magazine....use it to lighten up my face on my cheeks, forehead, chin and top of my nose. I love the look</li>
    <li> I was hoping this would be a nice primer or just a shadow that I could use with liner and mascara for a polished look. I find that it exaggerates any dry and crepe like look my lids may have. Makes me look older than I am. Still a very pretty shade, just not a flattering texture for me.</li>
    <li> Lasts through workouts, a nice plus. Only drawback is that it has a bit too much shine and is a little shy on pigment.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING as an eyeshadow primer. My eyeshadow stays on for hours without running or smudging! Definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> This stuff works pretty good . It is very light and subtle I like to use it more as a primer since my eyelids are so oily . It helps with less transfer . It lasts all day and gives a pretty natural look.</li>
    <li> This stays on for all day.  I really like the product and the color.</li>
    <li> I purchased another shade of this at the store, a grey, and I loved it, but it was a little too dramatic for use at work.  This shade is a perfect accent, and it meets my criteria of being easy to apply and of not clumping up.  I can go all day (8-10 hours) without having to worry about what is happening on my eyelids!  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this and will be buying more in the near future!</li>
    <li> It makes a great primer for my neutral smokey eye. I tap this on first (not swipe it) let it set for a few seconds and check if it creased. If so, I spread it out and blend. Then I go on with the rest of my make up. Recommended</li>
    <li> I use barely branded on its own on days I don&#x27;t feel like doing a lot of makeup or as a primer when I do. It adds a shimmer that isn&#x27;t over the top and stays in place all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also purchased the white one as a base for more dramatic looks. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This is the second time I have bought this product and the first barely branded lasted me nearly 6 months. It&#x27;s an excellent value.</li>
    <li> Highlighted the crepe-like texture of my eyes worst than any eyeshadow I have ever used and that is with using eye cream.  Probably fine for younger ladies, but I would not buy again.</li>
    <li> This had sparkles in it or I would have liked it..Gave to my daughter.</li>
    <li> Works very well as a shadow primer.  Just as good if not better than Mac&#x27;s paint pots</li>
    <li> This color is very pretty and it lasts the only problem is it&#x27;s a little to metallic for my taste even under eyeshadow.</li>
    <li> Love color tattoo, not a fan of this color. I was expecting a neutral, beige, shimmer, got a super high shine, glitzy gold. Don&#x27;t expect to look &amp;#34;barely branded,&amp;#34; more like, &amp;#34;extremely glittered.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re going for, it glides on smooth and lasts!</li>
    <li> Even the add on price is more expensive than buying this at my local target.  This eye shadow is very pretty.  I am 35 and do not wear a whole lot of color on my eyes so this skin tone with some shimmer is nice.  My skin is a medium light and this color is great for me.</li>
    <li> Better than expected!</li>
    <li> Good coverage and primer like qualities. It&#x27;s a little lighter than what I was expecting it to be so I just use it as a highlighter on my brow bone instead of as the whole lid base color that I was hoping it to be.</li>
    <li> The product was not what I expected.  It is VERY difficult to apply and is too light and shiny for me.  I&#x27;m disappointed with the product.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Purchased in barely branded and the color is extremely pigmented and beautiful. Since it is a cream shadow I do recommend wearing over an eyelid primer but not necessary.</li>
    <li> I have an ivory skin ten and it looked angelic on my skin tone. The texture was rich and creamy and went on, very well. It works just like the one you can buy in the store!</li>
    <li> love this....it gives just enough color to give a natural look &amp; it last all day.  Would buy again, barely branded</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I had never used it before but read a review for it on a blog and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I love that it helps brighten my eyes and it&#x27;s not a pain to apply. It stays on and doesn&#x27;t just rub off easily.</li>
    <li> I tried it on my hand and had a hard time getting off.  I think oily eyelids would benefit most. I found beige to be a few shades darker than it looks in the jar.</li>
    <li> Good, cool shimmer nude. Stays on well. Wears all day.</li>
    <li> This works for what it&#x27;s meant to. No disappointment, but it doesn&#x27;t stand out as a product I must have again.</li>
    <li> love them.  ink in pink and barely branded  are my favorites&lt;br /&gt;i usually wear them on top of a primer  so i cannot comment on the lasting power.  it does last all day for me&lt;br /&gt;n i can see why people complain about blending&lt;br /&gt;u need to blend them fast  otherwise they will dry on u  just like gel liner does&lt;br /&gt;otherwise they are perfect n can use by their own or as a base&lt;br /&gt;i love to use it as an all over the lid color  with another color on the crease  n i am ready to go</li>
    <li> Color: beautiful, but much lighter than it appeared in the picture on my computer&lt;br /&gt;Wear: excellent staying power&lt;br /&gt;Application: easy, though being a cream, had to dedicate a brush to it&lt;br /&gt;Appearance: this is why it got three stars; if you have even the slightest &amp;#34;bumpyness&amp;#34; on your eyelids, it not only shows it, but makes it look worse.</li>
    <li> Its an ok eyeshadow to use. It seems to crease during long wear though. If you&#x27;re in a hurry this is a nice shade to put on as a natural look. I have four other colors and they&#x27;re all very pigmented.</li>
    <li> Thank you! Just as described!</li>
    <li> I really believe this product is overrated.  Too metalic in color or too shiny looking.  I found it hard to apply and not blendable.  Definitely won&#x27;t repurchase</li>
    <li> When they say tattoo, they aren&#x27;t kidding. This stuff lasts, and lasts, and lasts. If you don&#x27;t take your makeup off at night (don&#x27;t judge), and wake up after a full night&#x27;s rest, it&#x27;s still there. It feels more like a powder than a cream, which I really like, and doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s weighing your lids down like some other creams can. I have this in both &amp;#34;Barely Branded&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Tough as Taupe&amp;#34;. The Barely Branded color is more of a light gold than a beige color. While I was hoping for a more neutral color to use as a base, I&#x27;m actually very please with the shimmery gold that kind of melts into my skin tone. When I use it as a base, anything I put over it stays put just as long. Even if I rub my eyes, this stuff isn&#x27;t going anywhere. It has never faded or smudged. Tough as Taupe is a really nice purple-brown (so, it&#x27;s taupe...), and I find that it&#x27;s a great compliment to my green eyes. It goes on rather dark, though, so I only use it sparingly and usually as a liner. A little goes a long way. A great long-wear shadow that actually does what it claims to do--last!!</li>
    <li> Great staypower. The color isn&#x27;t as orange in real life. I&#x27;m fair-to-light skin toned and when applied heavy, it is a little yellow and shimmery. When blended well (and quickly before it dries) it is a very nice highlighter and blends into my skin tone well for a nude base.</li>
    <li> I own 6 of the Color Tattoo shades, and this one is one of my favorites! Lasts FOREVER, and is a beautiful, shiny nude color. I found it makes an amazing primer, because as with all of the others, the consistency makes it perfect for holding other colors. I love building on them. This one is awesome with \\&quot;Bad to the Bronze\\&quot; and \\&quot;Too Cool\\&quot;, the brown and white shades. The price is really steep since I can get it at a local grocery for 6 dollars, but if you can&#x27;t find it anywhere, buy it!</li>
    <li> I am happy with this eyeshadow. It bright the eye open it if you contrast it with other darker color around. It came fast and the presentation was cute sweet. I am planning to order more eyeshadow from this vendor.</li>
    <li> Love this makeup use as a base or as a shadow</li>
    <li> This is such a nice color.  Very natural on your lids and up a bit.  And it lasts, just like it says.  Not sure about 24 hours because I never leave my makeup on that long.  It&#x27;s not good for you.  Makes your eyes old looking after awhile, or so I&#x27;ve read.</li>
    <li> I am relatively fair skinned, am usually a &amp;#34;buff&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;sand&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;nude&amp;#34; in foundation colors.  This product was so light it is barely visible on my eyes.  It would be good for a slight bit of highlighting or for a minimal makeup look but that is it.  I am betting though that this would be beautiful on people with much darker skin tones.  It was a disappointing purchase for me, unfortunately!</li>
    <li> This was too hard to apply. It went on unevenly and got all over the place. No applicator is included.</li>
    <li> I use it for subtle to dramatic eye effects. As a makeup artist, I always carry it in my kit.</li>
    <li> Barely braded is a warm, creamy beige with a frosted, metallic finish. I see this shade being very versatile and easily becoming a go-to eyeshadow base for a good portion of people. The shimmer when it sheers out is nice, and what I liked more about it was that it sheered out evenly so it could be easily used as a wash of color for when youâ€™re pressed for time. The best news of all, of course, is that it did in fact wear for a full twelve hours without creasing or fading when I tested it.  It had a nice creamy consistency that made for quick and easy application, and it built up color wellâ€“Iâ€™d say use less for sheer color, because it is was nicely pigmented. I was able to get opaque color in one layer using a flat brush. Totally loving this...</li>
    <li> The product got here very quickly. I used this cream eye shadow for the first time and it looked great. That night I fell asleep with all my makeup still on and even the next day it looked perfect and I didn&#x27;t even need to touch it up.</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with this eyeshadow lately.! I have it in three colors. This color, I use as both an eyeshadow and a highlighter. It works very nicely on the cheeks (if you use a very light hand) as a highlighter. These eyeshadows last a really long time, and I am looking forward to getting more of them.  I wish they had more colors! It is a great line.</li>
