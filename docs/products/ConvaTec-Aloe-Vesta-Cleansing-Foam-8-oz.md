    <li> Excellent product. Good cleanser. Definely will but this product again!</li>
    <li> good stuff!!!!!! I recommend it. Cleans, softens, easy to use and apply</li>
    <li> Love the foam.Not messy and smells awesome</li>
    <li> Bath in a bottle. The very best option when running water isn&#x27;t available. :)</li>
    <li> Great product.  Came faster then I expected. Thanks.</li>
    <li> It is wonderful and I won&#x27;t be without it.</li>
    <li> Love the product but I do prefer the lotion, although the foam goes further.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my elderly mom so she could feel fresh when she needed. She really liked the foam because  it was easier for her to use rather than liquid. She loved feeling and smelling clean after using this.</li>
    <li> I was first introduced to Aloe Vesta Cleansing foam when my father was in rehab following his first hip replacement.

    <li> Perfect product for body and hair</li>
    <li> Getting these for my dad who it bed bound. Good for his body but not good for his hair. Washing his hair left it with craddle cap that babies get. Other than that I like it.....</li>
    <li> Cleans well. Silky foam texture. Nice clean scent that caretakers commented positively on. Had to hide it to make sure it was available when needed ;-)</li>
    <li> The Aloe Vesta is very gentle on my sensitive skin.  This cleansing foam feels luxurious and I like the fact it is PH balanced.  I use this to shower and it does cleanse from head to toe and rinses well.  It has a pleasant light smell without irritating my skin.</li>
    <li> Using this with a little hot water and washcloth, is how I clean up quickly without using all the water of a shower or tub bath.  I was introduced to this product while a patient in the hospital in years past and learned of its value this way.  I now get it online and use it at least five days of a week.</li>
    <li> Love the foam wash. I used it for my dad who is no longer with us. And now I&#x27;m using it for my disabled son. It makes the job much easier and I love the product</li>
    <li> I have a severely handicapped child who, at 14, still wears diapers.  Using this after a diaper change completely eliminates the residual smell of a dirty diaper.  Her sensitive skin is not adversely affected at all.  Have recommended this product to other mom&#x27;s with children with special needs as well.  It truly helps preserve my daughter&#x27;s dignity when she smells fresh and clean. It is also a body and hair wash that does not need to be rinsed.  We have used it when traveling and a full bath or shower is out of the question because of accessibility issues.</li>
    <li> The product works as expected.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful lotion for bathing.  Makes the skin soft and fresh!</li>
    <li> Thank you for the fast service.  I was very pleased with the packaging, I was worried about leaking but they arrived without a hitch.  I look forward to ordering again.</li>
    <li> great product.  convenient to get a pack of 3</li>
    <li> For anyone taking care of someone who is bed ridden this is the perfect soap. Its not harsh. Doesn&#x27;t dry the skin and gets the job done. It&#x27;s also used in the hospitals. I have been buying this soap for 2 years for my partner who had a stroke. She loves it and has no complaints. I was so happy to see you can buy it through amazon. This soap is foaming and softly scented. Not over powering at all. I highly recommend it. If you do buy it make sure to buy the Aloe Vesta Cleansing Foam.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mom and it works really well.  Like having the foam type.</li>
    <li> I used it for one of the kids and it did the job well.</li>

    <li> have used this cleaner for years does a good jib and doesn&#x27;t  irritate my very sensitive skin</li>

    <li> VERY PLEASED WITH THE CONVENIENCE AND EFFECTIVENESS,</li>
    <li> I always keep a bottle or  two in my medicine cabinet.  If you travel it&#x27;s a good idea to have this product for quick bathing.  You don&#x27;t have to rinse off, but I use Aloe Vesta all over my body and then rinse off well, leaving my skin feeling soft and very clean.  I sent my granddaughters off to college with bottles of Aloe Vesta and they were very glad to have it.  I also keep some in my emergency kits for hygene away from home.  I highly recommend Aloe Vesta.</li>
    <li> As others have noted, afer a hospital stay this product becomes a &amp;#34; life saver&amp;#34;.  Wonderful that we can purchase it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;It truly is rinse free and leaves no residue. It smells fresh and clean and is easy on the skin.  We have many bottles at home.</li>

    <li> Came sooner than expected.Soft is a great cleanser that does not need to be rinsed off.Does a job of cleaning older adults clean without drying out their  skin.</li>
    <li> Found out about this when my husband was in the hospital. Took a chance looking online. Love this stuff!! My husband is immobile and confined to a hospital bed. This no rinse cleansing foam is so quick and easy to use!!</li>
