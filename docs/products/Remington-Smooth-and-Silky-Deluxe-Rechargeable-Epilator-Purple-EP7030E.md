      <li>Better then the tweezy !!</li>

      <li>And I am thrilled with the results!</li>
      <li>so I assumed this one won&#x27;t be good.</li>
      <li>This is a good product</li>
      <li>I loved thisssss.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel good but it is ripping your hairs out 1 by 1.</li>
      <li>I have fair skin, and it tore it up and it hurt like heck.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say, pain wise, 5 out of 10.    </li>
      <li>epilator is really, really good.</li>
      <li>I very pleased with the product.</li>
      <li>I must say this works magic!</li>
      <li>It is so amazing,</li>
      <li>Amazons customer service was Amazing as always, with their help.</li>
      <li>and it is amazing.</li>
      <li>you will have redness/bumps, so do it the day before if needed; buy yourself some kind of ointment for after-</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon for the great price and great customer</li>
      <li>Its nice because you do not have to wait for the hair to grow 4-6 weeks like waxing and shaving once in between in a pinch isn&#x27;t detrimental.     </li>
      <li>But it is handy to check if you&#x27;ve missed any spots with.</li>
      <li>I had the older version of this epilator that I found in a thrift store, unopened and everything, worked without charging, It was great!  </li>
      <li>The machine does what it promises, it works very good, pulling the hair from the roots and is easy to use and clean.</li>
      <li>Quick delivery great company.</li>
      <li>Have had better Epilators, much better !</li>
      <li>(lets be honest, most of us do it or should)</li>
      <li>I find for me that honestly, on my legs the faster speed works better.</li>
      <li>This was not really painful at all which was a pleasant surprise.</li>
      <li>I am thrilled with the immediate,  hair free results I was able to obtain!</li>
      <li>But now, my underarms are very smooth and I&#x27;m relieved I can stop having to shave them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The results are very smooth skin.  </li>
      <li>- I&#x27;ll still have to pluck a bit, but for the most part, it wasn&#x27;t too bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I upgraded to the Emjoi Emagine epilator and love it.</li>
      <li>The most comparable epilator I&#x27;ve used is the [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>that was the issue, but I know that I&#x27;m going to be using an epilator (vs. shaving) from now on :)</li>
      <li>Read all of the instructions twice to make sure</li>
      <li>and I want to be able to do it.</li>
      <li>I keep rubbing my chin and mustache area to make sure I am not imagining things!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Brought more as Christmas gifts for my mom and sister.</li>
      <li>Over time much to most of the hair does NOT return.</li>
      <li>I read many reviews on Amazon and decided to try the Remington.  </li>
      <li>(And these days I buy most things that are the cheaper price because I don&#x27;t have unlimited money to just buy</li>
      <li>Not as well as the reviews had said it would, but it was okay.  </li>
      <li>You would think for the price &amp; with the job its meant for it would be more durable.  </li>
      <li>I did love it</li>
      <li>I have purchased an Eplilady that has many fewer tweezers and a battery life of 40 minutes.</li>
      <li>I am assuming using it in the tub would be a better solution to that problem, though.</li>
      <li>Since it seems to be working better now, I&#x27;m changing my rating from 3 to a 4, but I am buying an Epilady</li>
      <li>This time, the unit did charge and I was able to use it:</li>
      <li>In fact, most of the hairs broke</li>
      <li>One thing I did notice was that I started to get more in grown hairs on my leg.</li>
      <li>I read several reviews that said this product was the best for the face and chin....</li>
      <li>I still love that it has a light though!</li>
      <li>Most painless epilator I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>, I like no chin hairs for a week or more.</li>
      <li>I used to spend a lot of time tweezing and &amp;#34;nairing&amp;#34; and now I use my Remington and dont have to tweeze anymore and better than that, I dont have &amp;#34;whiskers&amp;#34; any more.  </li>
      <li>She is very pleased with the results and says it is not really painful either.</li>
      <li>(ok, maybe more like 3-5).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s better and faster than tweezing or waxing the hair</li>
      <li>And Amazon, you should be more considered and carefull with this things</li>
      <li>Hurts quite a lot, I was expecting better results.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I liked the light feature on this epilator and would get that again.</li>
      <li>There are many brands of numbing cream sold on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Picked this item in US and when I gave this to my wife we just found that item is not working at all, even after charging for more than 6 hours</li>
      <li>So j was kinda post that I paid more than others and this s</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s all I was wanting and more.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m hoping to get more efficient with practice.  </li>
      <li>The pain gets more and more bearable each time I use it.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It hurts like waxing would or maybe even a little more because of the tweezers but if you have a high tolerance to pain you&#x27;ll see it&#x27;s worth it. You get a smooth skin for weeks.</li>
    <li> Most painless epilator I&#x27;ve tried.  None of them are pain free, but this one comes much closer.</li>
    <li> Not a big fan of this thing. I miss my $30 one that worked far better and didn&#x27;t want to leave tinny micro cuts all over my skin.</li>
    <li> Works well, this is my first one and I just got it today. I used it on my legs and arms which both have very thin hair and it removed all of my hairs no problem. I&#x27;m working up the courage to try my underarms but I am very sensitive so I don&#x27;t think it will happen.</li>
    <li> Works very well and keeps the hair away for 4 to 6 weeks. I love it. Brought more as Christmas gifts for my mom and sister. I&#x27;ve also raved about it to everyone I know.</li>
    <li> Completely unsatisfied with this product. I have dark hair and pale-ish skin, so when I shave my roots are visible. When ordering this product, I was looking forward to not seeing said roots and having overall smoother legs. Not the case. All this epilator did was break the hair off, and not even that closse to the skin! It looks like I&#x27;ve done a poor shaving job. I&#x27;m new to this, so I read all the instructions to make sure I was doing it right, I did it on dry, clean skin. Very unhappy with the results. If you have any tips or anything I might&#x27;ve done wrong then let me know becasue I really like the idea of epilating and I want to be able to do it.</li>
    <li> Powerful and easy to use with minimal discomfort.  Epilators are a revolution in hair removal; I have said goodbye forever to waxing and chemical creams.</li>
    <li> Hurts like hell but it gets the hair out pretty well. I use it while standing directly under the shower. Oh, and I use it for my face. The cleaning brush leaves a lot to be desired. I found that running the epilator in a bowl of water got all the pulled hairs out.</li>
    <li> I had the older version of this epilator that I found in a thrift store, unopened and everything, worked without charging, It was great!  THIS ONE&#x27;S charging light will turn off as if it&#x27;s fully charged, but it won&#x27;t even start.</li>
    <li> So.. there are no reviews on this Epilator, I will be the first bc I know how helpful it is. This is my second review on Amazon only because the items turned out amazing.. I just had to let everyone know and help out. I&#x27;ve searched for over a month on the perfect epilator with great reviews, after I heard the hype on them. I saw many great reviews on a few different brands, some were up by or over $100 and some lower. I knew I wanted it to be cordless and a great amount of tweezers. Was originally going to purchase the model before this one by Remington, but saw that there was this newer model available. There were absolutely no reviews on it, but it seemed so perfect that I decided to purchase it and give it a try. Amazon had the best price! Let me tell u, its such a great investment, so glad I caved in. i cant imagine going back to shaving. Im only a week in and it feels amazing! Its true that it might kind of feel uncomfy at first, but its not as bad as it sounds. Everyones sensitivity spots are different. you will find that some areas will sting (not hurt) and some you wont feel at all. but one thing i can say is i cant wait for my next epilation session! Crazy as it sounds. you will feel good after! Epilating will pull the hairs out from the root, the same way waxing will but less painful and messy! Your hairs will grow back much thinner and lighter and some have said will eventually not grow back at all after constant use. The only problem I had was that the shaver attachment was missing in the box. The box was brand new with security seal and everything, so I assumed it was the manufacturers fault for forgetting that piece in the box, not Amazons. Amazons customer service was Amazing as always, with their help. I knew I didn&#x27;t want the hassle of exchanging the item, Bc I&#x27;m happy with the product itself, but I did pay for everything that was supposed to be in the box so I thought it was only fair to credit me the amount for the missing part. Even though it took a long conversation, Amazon did solve the problem with a credit for that. Thanks Amazon for the great price and great customer service!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update in a month or so..</li>
    <li> I bought this today at my local Ulta. I&#x27;m no stranger to epilating- I had a Braun one that I never really liked and I think I finally dulled out the tweezers on because it would break my hair really bad so I finally threw it away.  Time for a new one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So let&#x27;s go through all the steps from purchase to use:&lt;br /&gt;Purchase:&lt;br /&gt;After reading a lot of reviews I decided on this because I think this is just basically a newer model of the others that do have reviews- which I could not find in the store and I wanted to buy it today. So I paid $69.99 and got $3.50 off with my Ulta card, but they also have them at Target right now for $59.99.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unboxing:&lt;br /&gt;Holy cow. For a while there I didn&#x27;t think I was going to get this thing out of box. Based upon past bad experiences, I wanted to be as gentle in the unbox as possible should there be a need to return the unit but they make that REALLY hard. You will need a box cutter to open the box, but what is inside is well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prep:&lt;br /&gt;The instructions say to charge for 4 hours but I charged for an hour and managed to completely do both legs AND my underarms.  I used this dry- it says you can use it wet and I&#x27;ve read reviews that say epilating is less painful wet but my hair breaks easily so I decided to suck it up and just do it. Maybe I&#x27;ll try that next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experiences differ from others and I&#x27;m sure yours will, too. A lot has to do with your hair type, your skin sensitivity, your tolerance for pain, and the general overall smoothness of your skin.  Me: hair type- lots of it, but it&#x27;s fine in some places and course in others and grows in all sorts of crazeballs directions. Skin sensitivity: quite sensitive. My initial reaction to waxing and epilating is difficult, but I usually heal up in about 24 hours. Tolerance for pain- mine is really, really high.  General skin smoothness- not so great, so it takes a lot for me to feel smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, all that being said, let&#x27;s talk about the epliating. So after the charge I set to work and this was just as painful as I remember, as in, it HURTS.  But- if you have had a tattoo or given birth, this hurts nowhere near as bad as either of those so if you lived through that, you&#x27;ll make it through this. But it is still pretty rough, when you first start out on each leg. For me, though, after about 10 minutes and half a leg, it tends to numb out and become bearable.  Some say to take pain relievers or booze before hand, but I tend to be less accurate if I hit the sauce before this so I do it \\&quot;dry\\&quot; ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the instructions say to use the slow setting at first, use the massaging head, and use circular motions. I find for me that honestly, on my legs the faster speed works better. The massaging head is fine and I would recommend using that for a beginner or someone who has not epilated in a long time. I don&#x27;t use circular motions, I use quick, 90 degree motions with the grain of the hair on the faster cycle. Take your time, give yourself breaks if you need to or just barrel through it like I did. I haven&#x27;t used the regular head with it but I probably will in the future because over time this really will cause your hair to grown in finer and you will find you need to do this less often.  In about a week, you will have some regrowth because newly epilated hair does break in places, so like shaving, those spots will grown back in. Also, hair grows in cycles so it may take a good 2-4 weeks before all the hairs are actually yanked out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This epilator is really, really good. It did what it says and actually did remove the hair at the roots and not break it off like my last one did, because I could SEE the roots in the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then went to my armpits. I tried the targeted head for this on slow speed but it was just taking too long so I sucked it up and put on the massaging head at slow speed and went for it. The pain was breathtaking but over soon- so again, there is that tolerance and mindset thing. I&#x27;m one of those people that believes you can endure darn near anything for less than a minute or so...which is about how long it took me on each pit (ok, maybe more like 3-5).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now I&#x27;m sitting here with mildly painful, red, swollen but smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom legs and pits and I gotta say, I&#x27;m impressed. The swelling, pain and redness for me will go down soon but it might not for you, so you may want to consider doing this a couple days before a day at the beach or whatever special occasion you want to be smooth for comes up.  Again, popping some ibuprofens before or after will likely help as it is an anti-inflammatory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another couple notes about this: you cannot use it plugged in, probably due to the fact that it works in water and this is a safety feature so you&#x27;ll have to charge it before use. It has a light on it to ensure you get alll the hairs (seriously, why would anyone make one of these WITHOUT this light??), quality seems good, it&#x27;s quieter than the Braun I had before by like, half, and I think it was a lot faster to remove hair on the high speed. The head pivots, which is helpful for the curvier parts of the legs. It comes with a pretty satin storage bag and a wisk brush to clean it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After you are done, wash it gently and let it air dry before putting it away to prevent germs from growing in it and that way it will be ready for action the next time you get all Sasquatch-y.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this epilator at this or any other price and can&#x27;t see buying a more expensive one. This gets the job done and has a bunch of tweezers in it. The fast speed is FAST. My old Braun took literally an hour or more and this took maybe half an hour?lerance and mindset thing. I&#x27;m one of those people that believes you can endure darn near anything for less than a minute or so...which is about how long it took me on each pit (ok, maybe more like 3-5).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now I&#x27;m sitting here with mildly painful, red, swollen but smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom legs and pits and I gotta say, I&#x27;m impressed. The swelling, pain and redness for me will go down soon but it might not for you, so you may want to consider doing this a couple days before a day at the beach or whatever special occasion you want to be smooth for comes up.  Again, popping some ibuprofens before or after will likely help as it is an anti-inflammatory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another couple notes about this: you cannot use it plugged in, probably due to the fact that it works in water and this is a safety feature so you&#x27;ll have to charge it before use.

    <li> I bought it two weeks ago and it&#x27;s not charging properly anymore and it works for 10 seconds and then stops</li>
    <li> Item as described and received on time, good deal!.</li>
    <li> I bought this epilator thinking it was going to last a long time. It worked for a while but just having it for about 8/9 months the red light would turn on while I would epilate, constantly! So while I would epilate I would have to turn off for a few seconds then turn back in to start again over and over until I was done epilating. I would recharge how the instructions said to and still would stop when I would epilate. Well then I knew I needed a new epilator.  From other epilators that I&#x27;ve heard were cheaper than when I got this, reviews would say it would last them up 2 yrs! So j was kinda post that I paid more than others and this s*** didn&#x27;t even last up to a yeAr.</li>
    <li> Picked this item in US and when I gave this to my wife we just found that item is not working at all, even after charging for more than 6 hours, it just doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;Spent so much money, now can&#x27;t even return it as the time has expired and I don&#x27;t stay in US.&lt;br /&gt;Remington doesn&#x27;t have any service centre at India</li>
    <li> This Epilator doesn&#x27;t break the hairs and will pick up short ones. Maybe I am just used to it but I don&#x27;t experience any pain when using it.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time!! Product was perfect</li>
    <li> Package came on time and was sealed. Product appeared to be charging but when I went to turn it on the motor did not spin. Cannot rate the item&#x27;s performance since it did not work from the outset. Very disappointed in Remington products.</li>
    <li> I have tried shaving, waxing, even using tweezors in my legs, and armpit! But the hair grows back in two days or so; it doesn&#x27;t last a while. And for some reason when I got pregnant, some unwanted hairs were growing on my face! Eeww I don&#x27;t like it. So I started doing wax but it doesn&#x27;t completely remove</li>
    <li> Hurts a lot, makes really loud noises (almost too scary to use), and has to be mulitple times on the same area to get all the hair removed, which kind of irritates the skin area&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s better and faster than tweezing or waxing the hair so im pretty satisfied</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t use it much since I got it but after few uses I like it. Will recommend it to other people.</li>
    <li> Used a few times, held a long charge the first few times I would charge it but then wouldnt charge at all. This seems to be a common problem with people recently. It stopped just past Amazon&#x27;s return window so I&#x27;m hoping the manufacturer backs its product and replaces it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my face since I&#x27;ve been dealing with unwanted facial hair since middle school.  This product fails to do as it&#x27;s advertised as it just leaves not only with hair on my face but redness as well.  $40 down the drain, don&#x27;t waste your money like I did.</li>
    <li> This review is for the 7030 model:&lt;br /&gt;I like the wet/dry feature. Using it wet with soap is pain-free. However, after working great for 5 minutes or so it quits and the red light comes on, even after a full charge. I know it has a safety feature that turns it off if you press too hard, but this almost seems positional. Sometimes I can just hold it in my hand and turn my wrist over and it will stop. Taking the head off and cleaning the foam out seems to help, but my thumb hurts from turning it on and off so much. (When the red light comes on you have to turn it off until the light goes then turn it on again.) I don&#x27;t know if mine is defective or if they all act up. Oddly enough it seems to work the best right before the battery dies. Sometimes when I turn it back on, the light goes green but the motor hesitates a bit. I would return it but I ruined the packaging trying to open it and have now used it 5 times thinking I was just pressing it too hard, not charging long enough, charging it too long, or using too much soap.&lt;br /&gt;If it did not stop running every few minutes I would rate it a 5. It is painless and more efficient per stroke than other epilators I&#x27;ve used. It isn&#x27;t especially loud and the battery lasts long enough to use on both legs without having to wait to recharge. It should take very little time to use, but not when you have to turn it on and off over and over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;Three days ago I used the epilator and it did not stop once until the battery ran out. This puzzles me because I did nothing different from the last eight times when it was stopping every 30-90 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;Tonight it stopped four times when trying to do my knees. Since it seems to be working better now, I&#x27;m changing my rating from 3 to a 4, but I am buying an Epilady anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;I used this several more times without any problems. 72 tweezers removes both thick and fine hairs quickly and efficiently. Even when I have used another epilator I finish up with this one. I can use this and only this epilator to do both legs, my underarms and anywhere else and still have plenty of battery life left. Last night I began using it and it was stopping every 3 to 5 seconds again. I gripped it very tightly and shook it hard toward the head. The motor revved up a bit and I had no more problems. I am not going to raise my rating again but I highly recommend this epilator. I have purchased an Eplilady that has many fewer tweezers and a battery life of 40 minutes. I could use it on one calf or thigh for the entire charge and still not remove all the fine hairs with it. I have been using the Remington for only a couple of months and I plan to update my review again to report on the life of the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;This one lasted only 4 months. The plastic gears stripped.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it says it does.  Removes hair painlessly.  You won&#x27;t be sorry if you buy this epilator.  Works better than any I have tried in the past.  I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Update:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve left my previous below.  It&#x27;s been 2 years since I&#x27;ve been using this and the epilator&#x27;s head unit has stopped rotating.  The base unit will turn on, but when I attach the head, it runs slowly and unevenly, then it stops.  There&#x27;s a red light that comes on and I can hear a squealing sound like it&#x27;s jammed.  I&#x27;ve always cleaned it after each use and I know that it&#x27;s not running because of the battery life.  It runs when the head unit isn&#x27;t attached.  Sigh.  Unfortunately, my warranty ran out a couple of months ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can apparently purchase a new head unit for this epilator, but I&#x27;m on the fence about it now.  The interchangeable guards are loose when they are on and the wide guard popped off a couple of times when it was in use.  I thought this epilator would have lasted longer than 2 years.  I always used it dry and I did like the results, but I will be looking for a corded epilator next time.  I&#x27;m hoping they are built sturdier and last longer than a cordless model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Now the base unit alone will run for a few seconds before it stops woking.  Sigh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Old review:&lt;br /&gt;Let me preface this review by stating that I have used epilators in the past and have pretty thin hairs on my legs.  I wanted an epilator to use dry on my legs, underarms, bikini area and face. I have tried a few different epilators recently and so far, I like the Remington EP7030 the best. The most comparable epilator I&#x27;ve used is the [[ASIN:B0077PLNNE Braun SE7681 Silk-&amp;eacute;pil 7 Wet and Dry Epilator, White]].  I have not used either wet because I&#x27;ve found in the past that dry epilating works the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are both use a similar style tweezing action to remove hair. They both are wet/dry, for face and body, have multiple attachments for use on a single head, use two speed settings, have a light, and are rechargeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest and most important difference I&#x27;ve found between the two are: the rotation speeds of the tweezing heads.  The Braun Silk-epil 7 on it&#x27;s lowest setting is much faster than the Remington. I found that the overly rapid speed of the Braun, cut more hairs rather than pulled them out. It also pinched my skin and even left me with cuts and red follicles (red dots) in places were the hairs were yanked out too rapidly or cut.  I have a few scars from it now.  The Remington&#x27;s slower rotation speed, in my opinion, made for a far more effective  epilating experience.  The slower speed allowed the tweezers to actually grip the hairs and yank them out.  I understand the logic behind quicker hair removal, but if you&#x27;re constantly going over the same spots because of missed hairs or cut hairs that you can still feel and see - what is the point of using an epilator to quickly remove hair?  I really wish manufacturers would make the speeds adjustable, or offer more speed settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only really use the wide angle cap and the slowest speed setting.  The rest of the attachment heads don&#x27;t really allow for epilation of short hairs.  It takes a little bit of experimentation to find the best way to use this.  I found that starting at about a 45 degree angle and making short strokes into a 90 degree angle to the skin works the best. It&#x27;s like you&#x27;re making a &amp;#34;scooping&amp;#34; action. The light can look a little purple-ish in places because of the color of the plastic and I wish it showed more of the skin directly in front of the epilating head.  The light seems a little far ahead of the area you are working on.  I still love that it has a light though! I wish we were allowed half stars on reviews, but even with the design flaws this is still the most effective epilator I&#x27;ve found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If pain is an issue for you and you don&#x27;t want to buy a numbing cream or spray, I would suggest using ice before and after you epilate a section at a time. For prevention of ingrown hairs, I&#x27;ve found that dry brushing and/or using an exfoliation cloth [[ASIN:B004NHC5DG 2 Asian Long Exfoliating Back Washcloth]] with a acne body wash containing salicylic acid (BHA). If you still get ingrown hairs, allow the acne body wash to sit on your skin a little longer before washing it off.  As a side note, if you are allergic to aspirin, do NOT use salicylic acid.  Instead use something with glycolic acid (AHA).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps someone.  Remember, everyone is different and your experience may be completely different, but keep trying different products until you find the right one.</li>
    <li> it works yeah but after like a week I tried to charge it, it would not charge at all. I am very upset!</li>
    <li> First, I purchased this epilator at Target because it was only 5 dollars more there, and I did not feel like waiting a week for it to arrive in the mail. Second, this is the first epilator I have ever used so I have no other ones to compare it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I had done lots of research on epilators and saw that women had many many mixed experiences with them. Some women said it hurt so bad they couldn&#x27;t take the pain, others said the pain was quite tolerable. I decided &amp;#34;screw it, if it hurts, it hurts.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this particular epilator because I have always had good experiences with Remington products in the past, and because compared to the Braun, it is much less expensive. (And these days I buy most things that are the cheaper price because I don&#x27;t have unlimited money to just buy whatever)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, I removed it from the packaging and plugged it into the charger. Read all of the instructions twice to make sure I knew what I was doing. After the epilator was done charging (only took about 45 minutes more or less), I turned it on and began on my legs. IT HURT. But I knew it would, come on now, you&#x27;re pulling hair out of your skin from the root, DUH. I continued through the pain until both legs were done. It did very well. I&#x27;m part Hispanic so my hair is quite thick and grows really fast, and this epilator got all of the hairs out. After I was done my skin was red and bumpy and stung a little, which is normal with any hair removal. But the best thing you can do for that is to just blot your skin with a soft, cool, wet cloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have now been using this epilator once a week to trim up the growth. (It&#x27;s been over a month since I bought it) The pain gets more and more bearable each time I use it.&lt;br /&gt;Also, just today, I used this epilator on my armpits. YES I KNOW, I&#x27;m crazy. And YES it hurt. But now, my underarms are very smooth and I&#x27;m relieved I can stop having to shave them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, this epilator rocks. If you can bare the pain and just get over it, you&#x27;ll love this epilator.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re sick of shaving, don&#x27;t want the cost/hassle of waxing your bikini area, BUY THIS!! It works wonders and is way less painful than waxing. If you have never used an epilator before, I will give fair warming that it really does hurt the first time. However, I will promise you that each time you do it, it hurts less and less. It now doesn&#x27;t hurt at all until I start going really far south. I also notice my hair grows back slower, not at thick, and less of it. WAHOO! I tried it both wet and dry and did not have any success in the shower. My recommendations- you will have redness/bumps, so do it the day before if needed; buy yourself some kind of ointment for after- I use bikini zone&#x27;s after shave gel; exfoliate with a baking soda/water mix at least once a week and the day of epilating- I have found this prevents ingrown hair and making the process easier; don&#x27;t use the high setting; hold your skin taught when doing it; and lastly, I find that using it in a back and forth motion rather than circular works better for me. I have also used this on my armpits twice, but found that the hair needs to be much longer than for my bikini area in order to get all the hair. If you can get away without shaving your pits for a week, then I would suggest that. Though this area still hurts like hell for me. I have yet to try the legs and doubt I will. I highly recommend this product and will never go back to shaving or waxing my bikini area again. THIS THING IS AWESOME. Seriously. Buy it.</li>
    <li> Of course it&#x27;s painful at first, but after a while you get used to it. Doing this definitely took longer for my hair to grow back. One thing I did notice was that I started to get more in grown hairs on my leg. I don&#x27;t know if I was using it wrong...I&#x27;m still giving it a chance and will continue using it for a month or so.</li>
    <li> Still trying to figure it out.</li>
    <li> At first this worked so-so.  Not as well as the reviews had said it would, but it was okay.  At the time I&#x27;d have given it 3 stars.  However, it&#x27;s sat in a drawer for a while and now won&#x27;t charge.  I had went back to my old one because it worked better than this one, and recently wanted to try this again to see if maybe it was ME.  Anyhow, I&#x27;ll never know because das kaput.  And it&#x27;s well past the return date.</li>
    <li> Battery died within 6months. Now it won&#x27;t hold a charge and can only be used for a few minutes at a time. Apparently this is a common issue. I upgraded to the Emjoi Emagine epilator and love it.</li>
    <li> I cannot believe how much I love this product.  I used to spend a lot of time tweezing and &amp;#34;nairing&amp;#34; and now I use my Remington and dont have to tweeze anymore and better than that, I dont have &amp;#34;whiskers&amp;#34; any more.  WONDERFUL!  And it arrived on a Sunday.  Quick delivery great company.</li>
    <li> I must say I was very skeptical about the product. It was sitting next to $99.90 Brown one so I assumed this one won&#x27;t be good. I was wrong. Gets the job done.  I&#x27;m glad I spent $59.00, not $99.90.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay but not impressed. I have fine hair and this epilator pulls the hair more than it plucks it. Hurts quite a lot, I was expecting better results.</li>
    <li> I have another that I use dry and it is amazing. I bought this one to use in the water. Cons are: It hurts just the same (water or no water). Needs to go over the area multiple times to pull all the hairs out. Pros: You use it each time you are in the shower, which means you do it often when there are fewer hairs, so it is less painful and less time wasted.  Update: I have been using it now for almost two years. I did love it but now it keeps dying after 2 minutes of use. I turn it off then wait a few seconds till it is alive again then dies after 10 seconds. I&#x27;m not sure if I need to replace the battery or the whole gadget.</li>
    <li> Better then the tweezy !! I like it so much</li>
    <li> Works pretty good. The first use was interesting took a bit to get used to. By the 3rd time using it doesn&#x27;t really hurt. I generally have to go over Ares a second or third time a few hours later on spots that were missed. The next day my legs are soft and smooth and it lasts longer than shaving. I now prefer this over a razor, or spending outrageous $ on waxing my legs.</li>
    <li> The machine does what it promises, it works very good, pulling the hair from the roots and is easy to use and clean.</li>
    <li> Really good, having the light and 2 speed modes is really helpfull! Plus it comes with diferent hair removal heads for different type fo hairs...</li>
    <li> This is a flat-out terrific product. It works efficiently, removes hair much faster (and more thoroughly) than tweezing, and is comfortable and easy to use. People have complained about the discomfort or pain. Seriously? I can&#x27;t imagine how they&#x27;ve gotten through life if they find this painful. You barely feel it. And in any case, you&#x27;re hair-free for a very long time!! Isn&#x27;t that the point? Long before this one wears out (which I don&#x27;t anticipate soon--it&#x27;s extremely well made), I&#x27;ll be buying another. I don&#x27;t want to be without it.</li>
    <li> I wish I had more details to share about this product, but unfortunately it did not work at all since I received it. There was no damage to the box nor the product and even after several hours of charging it did not work, showing that the battery is not charged.&lt;br /&gt;I have contacted the Remington customer service to highlight the issue and seek for their assistance and advice since 13th of March and, although I have received several responses to my follow-up emails that the matter is with their technical team, nobody contacted me and I still have a non-working product that I have paid for and for which Remington doesn’t deliver on the warranty terms. It is extremely disappointing to find out that, after deciding to buy this product convinced that it will do what is required, I can’t get any support from the provider.&lt;br /&gt;Base on this unpleasant experience, I don’t recommend you buy a Remington product, because if it happens that you need assistance, unfortunately the producer will not contact nor solve the problem.</li>
    <li> You would think for the price &amp; with the job its meant for it would be more durable.  I&#x27;ve owned 2 within the last 6 months. If your drop it just one time, it looses its ability it catch gears correctly.  $60 down the drain. Having owned a Braun I know they can be built to be durable.  Probably dropped my Braun 20 times without damage. It does grip the hair well, I have thick &amp; dark hair, it is also nearly painless. These reasons are why I gave 2 stars rather than 1.</li>
    <li> I have bad experience with this</li>
    <li> This epilator is well made with a lot of features. However, the directions state that the product is made to be used in circular motion, which I found to be unintuitive and ineffective for me. I also tried using it in short strokes, but that didn&#x27;t work much better. I tried using it on my underarms and it was just not possible for me to move it around in a circular motion to pick up the hairs. It would pull and kind of get stuck for a split second. I must have gone over my right armpit for about an hour and I still wasn&#x27;t finished. Then I tried soaking in the bath for a while before trying again, it was slightly better but still terrible.  I found using this epilator to be very frustrating, it just wasn&#x27;t effective for me. I also found it to be much more painful than other epilators I have tried.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great little device,but the head pops off easily if slight pressure is applied. It happened a opulent of times during my first use of it, but now that I know how to handle it, it&#x27;s actually pretty nifty.</li>
    <li> I bought this epilator yesterday at a local Target. I have never used an epilator before. I must say that I was quite apprehensive to try it after reading other reviews about how painful they can be. Thankfully, that was NOT the case for me! I had absolutely no pain whatsoever when using it dry on my legs and face. Now it was somewhat painful on the inside of my legs near my lady parts and left awful red marks. I hope that will ease up after continued use, or I will just have to shave that very small area. Also, I have not tried it on my upper lip, since I&#x27;m afraid of those red dots. I&#x27;ll have to work up the courage when I don&#x27;t have to go to work. I also have not tried my armpits, luckily I have light colored hair and don&#x27;t have to shave them but every couple of days. It is noisy.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work at all right out of the box. I&#x27;m returning it for a refund.</li>
    <li> I found this product to be ineffective at hair removal, but I returned it because it was painful to use. It felt like hundreds of tiny knives whacking at my skin. Terrible.</li>
    <li> This was my first time using an epilator and I was well-aware of the pain factor, but it wasn&#x27;t that bad - mind you, I&#x27;ve plucked my underarm hairs before (and THAT hurt!) so I guess I have a moderate pain tolerance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I like the different caps that it comes with but I found that (after watching a Youtube review), it actually works a lot better WITHOUT any cap on it - you get a wider area and you still don&#x27;t get it too close to the skin. I used it on my legs and underarms and got pretty decent results. I had just shaved the week before, so the hairs weren&#x27;t that long, but it still removed most of them. You DO have to go over the area quite a few times, but once you&#x27;re done, you&#x27;re left with smooth hairless legs :) My legs were a bit irritated afterwards, but that just comes with the territory - I mean, I just PLUCKED a ton of hairs all at once; with any kind of plucking, you will get some irritation. But the results are well worth it. My underarms were a different story, however - I have bumpy underams, so it didn&#x27;t get every single hair - I&#x27;ll still have to pluck a bit, but for the most part, it wasn&#x27;t too bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if it was the brand of epilator or the type of tweezer (lots of little short tweezers vs. a few big/long ones) that was the issue, but I know that I&#x27;m going to be using an epilator (vs. shaving) from now on :)</li>
    <li> I bought this Epilator yesterday in a store and thought I would write a review, here, since a lot of people buy it here. I researched hair removal systems for months because I am not happy with my current system of shaving or waxing. I originally wanted a laser, but after reading the reviews for them and hearing that I will still most likely have some hair and some regrowth and have to continue to treat, anyways, I went for a cheaper option because if I am going to continue having to remove the hair, why not?    A little about me because I think it is important to understand where someone is coming from, prior to reading a review:    I am a 30 year old, mother of 3 small children, I am fair with very sensitive skin, I am Italian, French, and Russian and have dark, thick, coarse, body hair. I shave my legs in the morning and have stubble by the late afternoon again (5 o&#x27;clock shadow, really?). Shaving my bikini line is a NIGHTMARE. Basically, if I shave, anywhere, daily, I get red and irritated almost immediately. I have to shave my underarms daily and those get irritated too. I have to change razors every 4 or so shaves as well, which is expensive because I cannot use cheap razors. I feel like I am constantly deciding whether to be hairy or be uncomfortable from shaving. Waxing works well for me and the pain of waxing doesn&#x27;t bother me, at all, at this point, however, the time it takes to go and get waxed, making an appt, being away from my kids, paying for the service and a sitter, is not always easy. Plus, getting waxed all at once to save time is NOT pleasant. Eyebrows, Lip, Legs, Brazilian, by the end of it, I am exhausted and sore.    The most important things to me in a hair removal system are:  Efficiency  Ease of use  CLEANLINESS******    Onto my review:    I used the Epilator on my legs, dry. I have not tried it elsewhere because I am going away this weekend with my husband and I do not want my skin to be angry or red at all in places I cannot cover. My leghair was only 1.5 days of growth and about 1/16 of an inch but the Epilator grabbed it. The hair was removed with ease and it def didn&#x27;t cut it because the hairs were much longer than what was showing above the skin, once pulled out. I did have to go over the area a few times and still have some hair left but that is normal and I plan on Epilating every other day until I get it all, since hair grows in many cycles. I did follow some recommendations from other users like doing small sections at a time at first. Also, I held my skin taut and that seemed to help, although not necessary. It IS painful. I am sure as the hair thins and grows less it will get easier. I am excited to use it on my underarms later when the hair is just long enough, although I anticipate that will be painful. On a scale of 1-10 in pain, I will give it a 6. It&#x27;s annoying pain, think getting a large tattoo about 3 hours in (if you have one). My legs are VERY angry and red but that is normal for me, even with waxing.    I gave it 4 stars for one reason and it&#x27;s not really a flaw of the Epilator, using it dry is a little messy! The hairs fly all over. I am assuming using it in the tub would be a better solution to that problem, though. I just didn&#x27;t expect it (Stupid on my part, where did I expect the hairs to go? LOL). I will say, it is MUCH better than at home wax or depilatories in the mess factor area.    I hope this review helps! All in all I am VERY impressed with this Epilator!    Edited to add: I have now used the epilator on all areas I desire hair to be removed. I wanted to come back and write a bit more.     Underarms: VERY efficient and very pleased with results, pain was about a 4 out of 10. Even with the smaller area attachment, however, the hair can be hard to remove under the arm, which is true of waxing as well.     Bikini: I used the epilator on my bikini, I did not do a full brazilian because I do not feel comfortable using it on my labia, however, the rest was not really bad,it really, WASN&#x27;T. IDK if I am used to it because of waxing or it&#x27;s put in perspective from giving birth (LOLOLOL) but it just wasn&#x27;t that bad. Only thing is you have to be able to contort yourself into some odd positions and be willing to touch up spots the next few days. I&#x27;d say, pain wise, 5 out of 10.    Legs: still by far the WORST pain-wise. It takes a lot of time. I do them in increments over a few nights. It is hard to get around the knees with the device but it can be done. Again exfoliation is key here. I&#x27;d say this area is a 6/7 out of 10. If you use it and then keep using it every few days, you will get all the hair and it will pay off in the end.     Toes/feet/lower belly area: works well in these areas and doesn&#x27;t really hurt much....    A few notes:    YOU HAVE TO EXFOLIATE! Do it daily, once the tenderness and redness subsides from removal, also creams like Finipil afterwards on the bikini area will stop the infected bumps.     Continue using it every few days, especially on large areas. Its nice because you do not have to wait for the hair to grow 4-6 weeks like waxing and shaving once in between in a pinch isn&#x27;t detrimental.     You will be red and irritated, plan accordingly. I have extremely sensitive skin and it was the worst the first time I used the Epilator, it has gotten a lot less severe with subsequent use.     Overall, the original review and rating I gave stands.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not going to mince words people. I hadn&#x27;t used one of these in awhile. But as I get older, I felt the need for it again. I use it on my arms and chin. It is not comfortable. My husband has seen me use this, with wide eyes and chocolate at the ready. I think the neighbors are thinking I&#x27;m hollering for other reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product. Makes me feel alive!</li>
    <li> It does the job very, very well.</li>
    <li> This sucks. Only worked for three months and then wouldn&#x27;t charge. Will not be buying anymore small gadgets from Amazon. Sucked big time</li>
    <li> I was trepidacious about using this product.  The first time was a little uncomfortable, certainly less painful than waxing and it lasted longer.  Have only used it on facial hair.  And I am thrilled with the results!</li>
    <li> It quit on the second use.  I have emailed the company twice, but so far, no reply.</li>
    <li> Its an okay product you can really see the device getting the hairs from the root. The hair gross back less coarse and slower. ......BUT omg when I first used it, hurt so bad and I have an high pain tolerance. I did the hair in sections in the course of like 3-4 days. But after it was gone it got easier and easier. That still hurt like a fu**ing bi**ch. As they say tho beauty hurts.</li>
    <li> This wasn&#x27;t nearly as painful as I thought it would be.  It doesn&#x27;t feel good but it is ripping your hairs out 1 by 1.</li>
    <li> This is simple to use once you get use to it.  I really like the light. It helps me to see the light color hairs.</li>
    <li> This one seems to break about half the hairs instead of pulling them out. So my hair is thinner now but still end up with stubble the next day and some ingrown hairs. Exfoliating helps. Also seems to have much better grip on hairs if everything is completely dry. I&#x27;m not sure I would recommend this particular one or not.</li>
    <li> This is less discomfort than I experienced in tweezing my eyebrows. My experience has been that the hair follicles grow back MUCH more slowly than with shaving. Over time much to most of the hair does NOT return. With repeated use of the EP7030 not all the previous hair returns.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using epilators for about 25 years, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the quality &amp; price of the Remington7030. A favorite feature is that the head can be removed completely; it will make cleaning easier and more thorough than with fixed-head previous models I have used, and also no hairs will disappear down into the mechanism. This model is also much lighter that any I&#x27;ve used before, and I think going cordless is going to make it easier to maneuver around the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others have already posted useful information here on how to use the epilator, so I will just add a few tips that I&#x27;ve learned over the years:&lt;br /&gt;*Before you can expect to be hairfree for 4-6 weeks (with the occasional touch up), you must epilate regularly through an entire cycle of your personal hair growth pattern. For me, that means epilating weekly for about 5 weeks. Early on, even after you&#x27;re sure you&#x27;ve thoroughly epilated every round of new growth as it grew in, you may still discover a tiny clump of hair has popped up overnight on your calf or chin or wherever -- these are just follicles that have gotten off the schedule of the rest of your hair growth. Eventually most of your regrowth will be on a similar schedule.&lt;br /&gt;*If you&#x27;re new to epilating, take it slow and you WILL get used to it. Try first doing a small area around one knee; if it starts to sting too much, press your palm firmly against the area for a few seconds then move to the other knee. If your skin is very sensitive, it may even take a few days to get the first leg done, but that&#x27;s ok.&lt;br /&gt;*Helpful supplies: a glass of wine before you start and Lidocane (sunburn) spray for cooling afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;*Do your face in the evening, in case of redness.</li>
    <li> Just got this and OMG! It is wonderful for the face. Have been using a nono and hate it. It can burn you and because it burns hair off it smells terrible. This was not really painful at all which was a pleasant surprise. Really took the hair off. So far this is just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I owned/used a Silk-Epil epilator for many years and it finally stopped working.  The same brand wet/dry newer model was almost double the price of this Remington epilator and -- at the time I ordered this -- the reviews for Remington were decent so I chose this one over the Silk-Epil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first Remington unit I received was practically DOA -- as with another reviewer&#x27;s experience, the unit would not hold any charge and so would not turn on.  I returned it and Amazon sent a replacement.  This time, the unit did charge and I was able to use it: I do not have any good things to say about this and, after owning it for over 6 months, will surely not recommend this to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Remington epilator is weak. i.e. Slow and not powerful, at all, whether it is fully charged or not.&lt;br /&gt;It does not pluck hair well.  In fact, most of the hairs broke and so I had to make extra passes.&lt;br /&gt;It is painful to use this:  I also got many nicks from my skin being pinched by the epilator.&lt;br /&gt;And, finally, after using this approximately *3 or 4 times* (at most!  This epilator was proving to be so useless to me, I often went to a salon instead) over the course of 6 months, it died and would not turn on even after being charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I could give less than one star since ordering this turned out to be a waste of money, I would give it negative scores.</li>
    <li> Works good, hurts like expected when ripping out several thick dark hairs from my face lol The price was right, keeps a good charge, moving it in small circles is recommended by the manufacturer. Some hair breakage, but this is my first time using one and I did a dry run without soaking or using lotion on my winter dried out legs. Plus had really long leg hair (don&#x27;t judge!) :D I loved it for my chin and neck hairs, but man oh man upper lip... just hurts to bad for me to use it for that yet. Maybe holding ice to the upper lip fir a bit before hand would help. I&#x27;d rather have someone wax my upper lip so far though, cause just OW with random hairs on the upper lip being grabbed and it taking a few minutes to get them all. Coarse chin hair, hurt but liveable, you sort of go numb after a few minutes with the chin. &amp;#62;.&amp;#62; I wouldn&#x27;t give it up though, I like no chin hairs for a week or more. Not many ingrown issues so far (I get more irritation from a razor to my chin). The hair also does not grow back so stiff and sharp (pokey) as it does with shaving on the chin. Love this product for the chin, hate it for the upper lip, not sure about it yet for the legs because I don&#x27;t do the exfoliating and lotion like most girls do.</li>
    <li> She is very pleased with the results and says it is not really painful either.</li>
    <li> Not compatible with 230 V .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using epilators for years, and I&#x27;ve owned this one as well as two Braun models. I liked this at first, thought it was nice to be able to use it in the shower and the motor in this was a lot more powerful than my old Braun model, but after a year of using it, it no longer holds a charge. You also can&#x27;t use it plugged in. So I ended up getting the Braun 5 series and it&#x27;s awesome and it&#x27;s actually a lot less painful and more efficient at getting the short hairs. Do yourself a favor and don&#x27;t waste your money on this one. There are better options available.</li>
    <li> I have fair skin, and it tore it up and it hurt like heck.  No lotion or cream helped clear it, and now I look like I have a rash in those areas of the body where I tested it.</li>
    <li> I previously owned a Braun Epilator but went on the hunt for a new epilator after I was unable to find a replacement head. This is my first Remington. I have been using it for about two months and I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: under $100, pretty clean epilation, gentle enough for face around jaw line &amp; chin (lets be honest, most of us do it or should), charges quickly, multi-head cleaning brush, wet or dry use, pivot head which is more effective in curved places such as the underarm (unlike my previous Braun), IMO seems the epilation is visibly cleaner than when I used a Braun&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: the guard pops off at random times (fortunately the tweezers aren&#x27;t sharp enough to break the skin), seems like the opening for the tweezers is a little bit smaller than the Braun, feels like the guard doesn&#x27;t allow the tweezers to be as close to the skin as a braun- resulting in making a few extra passes- however end result is satisfying</li>
    <li> This product is a no go!</li>
    <li> I bought this product with a lot of hope. I have course hairs on my chin and I hate tweezing them. I refuse to shave and hair removal creams don&#x27;t work. After reading reviews and product information, I decided to purchase the Remington EP7030 epilator. I read all the warnings and reviews that stated that it would hurt the first few times until you go used to it - I anticipated this. What I didn&#x27;t anticipate was that is would chew the flesh of my chin off. I read the instructions carefully and used it exactly how it was supposed to be used. It did not remove the course hairs I was wanting, instead it removed part of my skin. Not happy at all with this product. It has been boxed up and returned for a refund. I&#x27;ll just stick to tweezing the hairs individually for now.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I was always hesitant to do something like this, so I just bleached, but I was getting to a point that I couldn&#x27;t stand all the hair on my face, I am on medication that I think increased it. So, I bought this and WOW it worked I haven&#x27;t felt my face without hair in so long I was shocked it felt really nice I couldn&#x27;t believe it.  It does it hurt a little but not that bad.</li>
    <li> This takes time to get used to but when you do it does the job!</li>
    <li> This is great for in-between waxes but if you try to use it in the shower good luck! You will need it. You need to pass over an area many times even on the dry settings.  I use it for my underarms and legs and so far it works best on legs, and if you go very slowly it works best but also hurts more that way.  I think waxing is way less painful.  This is good but not great.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife to replace the old model she had for few years now, and so far she is loving it.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this epilator; it works very well.  I bought this unit because it was rated as the best epilator for coarse hair on an independent site.  I use it primarily on my face for those thick white \\&quot;granny hairs\\&quot;.  It works well on the coarse hairs, as well as the peach fuzz on my face and upper lip.  No more trips to the salon for waxing! It is not to be used on eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a learning curve to get the angle and pressure just right as well as keeping the skin taught, and glide it slower than you would a razor.  I did have to go over the same area a few times to get everything.  Faces and chins are much more difficult to do than legs.  I&#x27;m hoping to get more efficient with practice.  The results are very smooth skin.  I&#x27;m looking forward to only having to do this every few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pain level is about the same as waxing or tweezing.  Painful for the novice, mild discomfort for someone who is used to waxing and tweezing. As with waxing, immediately after using the unit, I used ice then aloe to minimize skin irritation on my face.  I don&#x27;t think this would be necessary for legs unless you have very sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***If the pain bothers you, apply a laser or tattoo numbing cream as directed before using the unit.  There are many brands of numbing cream sold on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As directed, I brought the unit to full charge before I used it.  This will maximize the life of the battery.  I also plan to keep it clean so it should last a long time.  This is the first epilator I&#x27;ve owned so I can&#x27;t compare it to other brands, but I&#x27;m very satisfied and would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very loud and doesn&#x27;t remove hair very well.</li>
    <li> This is not working as advertised. Not happy with the product&#x27;s job</li>
    <li> I had expected this to take about the same time as waxing or shaving. It took so much longer. Not pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> The product does wat it says it does after short term use.Wil post another review in 2mths after extended use.</li>
    <li> The product is fake, I bought this on April, and now the machine don&#x27;t work anymore.</li>
    <li> I had an old cheap Epilator and I felt it was just cutting my hair instead of yank it from the root.  This device really works wonders on your face. I like the fact that it&#x27;s wet and dry. Though I think I will only use dry. I like the you can use it for your face, this product is much more effective than that small devices out on the market.  The light it really valuable, it assures that your really getting all the hairs. I very pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> Liked it when it was working, but less than 3 months and used not more than 10 times, it quit working!</li>
    <li> Great, got one for my daughter and myself, great product</li>
    <li> This product change my skin!! I had a lot of problems because my skin is very sensible,so i tried this product and it works very good to me, now no more hair and no more itch in my legs and in all body. I recomended 100%</li>
    <li> So, I was incredibly skeptical about purchasing this product.  I wanted the results of waxing without the continual cost and definitely can&#x27;t afford laser hair removal.  I purchased it for the light peach fuzz all over my face that I can never get all of with a set of tweezers.  I wasn&#x27;t sure how effective this would be with such fine hair.  I have to say, it removed almost every hair on my face and chin. I couldn&#x27;t believe it!  So, I decided to try another difficult area.  My underarms have dark coarse hair.  I&#x27;m not going to lie, the underarms were quite painful, but I stuck it out and, again, was incredibly pleased with the results.  The hairs weren&#x27;t broken but were genuinely removed.&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars because it IS painful to use.  However, when you consider that you are plucking the hair from your body, it is sort of expected!</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s face it this epilator is pricier than some of our other options. I went for it because of the built-in light and because the tweezer count is (40) on the high end.  I bought it to replace my lost two-year old Panasonic ES-WD51-P which has 48 tweezers and I do believe is faster at removing hair than this one. The light is useful to have although it&#x27;s not angled well for use while you&#x27;re running the epilator. But it is handy to check if you&#x27;ve missed any spots with. Is the light feature worth an additional $20-$30? Probably not.</li>
    <li> I loved thisssss. Worked great until one day about two months of having it, I went to use it and it wouldn&#x27;t come on at all.</li>
    <li> Not a great product. I expected more. This just breaks ur hair and gives u lots of pain.</li>
    <li> Two stars because it&#x27;s okay on other areas other than my face. Okay so I used this on my face and it has completely ruined my skin. For the past 4-5days I have had a red rash on both cheeks to my jaw line (I am obsessed with the tiniest hair being on my face that&#x27;s why I used it) and it&#x27;s so bad they look like acne which I have never had and what is worse is that it feels like I have tiny pebbles in my skin when I run my hands over it. It&#x27;s depressing to pay so much for a product after three months of research and come out with such a horrific outcome. I do not recommend this for your face what so ever. I am extremely unhappy.</li>
    <li> Worked alright but have pimples after using this ... :(  tried cleaning the area ASAP after using still figuring out why its happening ....</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave your legs that well. Have had better Epilators, much better ! Not real happy with product at all.</li>
    <li> The item did not charge, so I had to return it. The item appeared to be new and unopened, so it might have just been bad luck!</li>
    <li> I find myself going back over my legs the next day or two. I think some of the hair is not being pulled from the root then. This still beats shaving.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s all I was wanting and more.  No longer have to purchase blades for a traditional razor.</li>
    <li> Product did not work at all. Had to return.</li>
    <li> I liked the light feature on this epilator and would get that again. This epilator only worked in the shower-- it was useless at dry epilating, and more painful. However, I always had to finish with shaving if I wanted a complete job. It did a decent job for the first few months, then would only work for a few seconds before shutting off (despite having a fully charged battery). I would turn it off, I&#x27;d wait a few seconds, then it would work for 2-20 seconds, shut off, repeat. Needless to say, it would a very long time to make any progress! Then it just stopped working all together. I certainly expect a product like this to last more than 6 months. Extremely disappointed.</li>
    <li> Ok so i&#x27;ve bought this machine twice and in none of them have worked!!! I had to ask for a refund, and then i thought that if i buy it again it will work but NOO!! So please don&#x27;t buy this thing. Don&#x27;t loose your time! And Amazon, you should be more considered and carefull with this things, i&#x27;m considering to never buy again in this page.</li>
    <li> The idea of this product was great. I was so excited. I got it and it didn&#x27;t work, I got a defective product. It wouldn&#x27;t even turn on or charge. So disapointing.</li>
    <li> This is the third time I buy this product and it doesnt look like it&#x27;s working properly. The last time, the product wouldnt be able to charge; this time it goes too fast and make weird noize when I turn it on, so I didnt even use it and ask for a refund. This is a good product but I need something that is working properly.</li>
    <li> Item won&#x27;t hold a charge. It will run for only 3 to 5 minutes before needing to be recharged. It must have been an old item that should have been taken.off the shelf.</li>
    <li> Although I have given very few reviews on Amazon, I feel so strongly about this epilator that I simply had to recommend this wonderful product.  This is my first epilator.  At age 60 something, I have been increasingly struggling to manage my old lady chin hairs.  Who knew you start growing WHISKERS as you age?!  This has been an ongoing and silently maddening problem for me for several years now.  I have been tweezing daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally fed up, I looked into permanent hair removal.  My goodness, the expense!!!  So I decided to try an epilator before going to such extreme measures.  I read many reviews on Amazon and decided to try the Remington.  They have been making shavers for decades, so I figured they know a bit about hair removal.  I have only used the epilator twice, but after only my second use, my face has been hair free for 5 days!  FIVE DAYS!!!  It is so amazing, I keep rubbing my chin and mustache area to make sure I am not imagining things!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the middle size guard thing, set it on low speed, and go slowly, pulling my skin taut like men do when shaving, repeating areas until I no longer feel any hairs being pulled.  Having tweezed for years, the pain seemed minimal to me (I do have pretty sensitive skin), but at any rate, I was prepared for some discomfort. This hair problem has had me so unhappy, I was willing to put up with almost any amount of pain, if the hair could be kept at bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This just solves so many problems for me, especially travel issues.  I can pack this with me for trips lasting longer than a week.  No more tweezers confiscated at the security check in!  No more waking with whiskers!  No more five o&#x27;clock shadow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have course and fine hair on my face.  I am hoping, as stated in many reviews, the hair growth continues to become less and less as I use the epilator more.  I may try this on my underarms and legs at a later time.  For me the simple joy of not having to tweeze my face daily, is quite simply a miracle.  I plan to buy another one of these and tuck it away for future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you hate the hairs on your chinny chin chin, PLEASE try this.  With lovely Amazon you have 30 days to return it, so what can you lose besides disgusting, awful whiskers?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If my opinion changes, I will write an update, but for now, I am one happy woman!simply a miracle.  I plan to buy another one of these and tuck it away for future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you hate the hairs on your chinny chin chin, PLEASE try this.  With lovely Amazon you have 30 days to return it, so what can you lose besides disgusting, awful whiskers?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If my opinion changes, I will write an update, but for now, I am one happy woman!</li>
    <li> This product is a god send! Its easy to use and runs just as the directions describe.  I bought this on a whim hoping it would do the trick. I read several reviews that said this product was the best for the face and chin....I must say this works magic! I wont ever go back to using a no no ever again. I am thrilled with the immediate,  hair free results I was able to obtain!</li>
    <li> After testing this out for the last two months, I am ready to review this item.  I was sick and tired of tweezing, waxing and shaving the hair on my chin.  After you have children, you tend to grow hair in places you never knew you could grow hair.  I was in need of other options, and stumbled upon this little tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading other reviews, I was anticipating a little pain or discomfort, but not at all.  Maybe my skin in that area is less sensitive from all the waxing, etc...This tool is worth every penny.  It comes with a pretty little storage bag, charger and adapters.  I use the smallest one for my chin area.  The hair seems to stay away longer after using this, which is a great thing.  I have not used it anywhere else on my body. but plan to do so soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are in need to an alternative to waxing, shaving and tweezing, this is the tool for you!!</li>
