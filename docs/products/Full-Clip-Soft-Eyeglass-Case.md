      <li>/very pleased with the case.  </li>
      <li>Beautiful quality for FULL SIZE eyeglasses; however my eyeglasses are more slender, or that new unisex rectangular shape.</li>
      <li>Lined and sturdy, with a strong plastic clip.  </li>
      <li>and it is fine.</li>
      <li>I was happy to find it after searching through several drugstores</li>
      <li>/&gt;These will fit most types of glasses but not, for example, sun glasses with extremely large frames.</li>
      <li>It was what I wanted and it arrived quickly and smoothly in ordering.</li>
      <li>Order was shipped quickly.</li>
      <li>Well worth the price, except for one thing.  </li>
      <li>Good glass case for my husband, not too wide.  </li>
      <li>I am pleased with the brown soft eyeglass case.  </li>
      <li>It is a nice case but the clip is loose.  </li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for in terms of value.  </li>
      <li>exactly what I ordered.  </li>
      <li>The spring portion of the pocket clip is made of plastic rather than steel, and the clip on the first case I used broke during the first week of use.  </li>
      <li>been looking for a long time for them  the most inportant thing in his life  to catty them everywhere</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
      <li>(I bought three, and use them to keep reading glasses in my shirt pocket), and it was shipped very promptly.</li>
      <li>More expensive than ideal, but that is largely due to shipping.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The provider should give more advertised detail about the difference between half and full-clip variants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My husband liked it very much, not good if you bend down to much as glasses will fall out.</li>
      <li>Roomy enough for large glasses.</li>
      <li>That said, any case like this offers virtually no crush protection.</li>
      <li>and I didn&#x27;t want a hardcover larger case, because it would take up too much room in my purse.</li>
      <li>I only wish it came in brighter colors because brown and black are easy to lose.</li>
      <li>It is exactly what I expected it to be, it does what I want</li>
      <li>It is sized to handle small and large glasses alike, and the inside is soft to prevent scratching.</li>

    <li> I bought two or three of these and was immediately disappointed in the quality.  The spring portion of the pocket clip is made of plastic rather than steel, and the clip on the first case I used broke during the first week of use.  The remaining cases seemed to have some oily substance on the interior which smeared the lenses of my glasses every time I put them inside, so I stopped using them.  I wouldn&#x27;t suggest that anyone spend money on these.</li>
    <li> Roomy enough for large glasses. Well padded for protection. I only wish it came in brighter colors because brown and black are easy to lose.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for in terms of value.  Case is flexible and appears as though it will last longer than what I got at optometrist office.  Have had it a few months so far.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with the brown soft eyeglass case.  It was what I wanted and it arrived quickly and smoothly in ordering.</li>
    <li> Well worth the price, except for one thing.  The clip that holds the case to your shirt pocket is actually not capable of doing that.  I fixed the problem by gluing a little piece of sandpaper on each side of that part of the clip where the two edges touch.</li>
    <li> It is sized to handle small and large glasses alike, and the inside is soft to prevent scratching. The clip, although plastic, works well and is nicely placed for most shirt pockets. That said, any case like this offers virtually no crush protection.</li>
    <li> /very pleased with the case.  Just what I was looking for.  Order was shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> Not much you can say about a glass case. I lost two that I owned previously and this replaced it.</li>
    <li> The eyeglass case met all my expectations.</li>
    <li> It is a nice case but the clip is loose.  Tried to use it on a visor in the car and it did not hold. I am using it elsewhere and it is fine.</li>
    <li> Great case a I was happy to find it after searching through several drugstores</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and essentially as described. More expensive than ideal, but that is largely due to shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The provider should give more advertised detail about the difference between half and full-clip variants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These will fit most types of glasses but not, for example, sun glasses with extremely large frames.</li>
    <li> A simple, inexpensive product, but one I could not find at local stores, including several opticians.  It is exactly what I expected it to be, it does what I want (I bought three, and use them to keep reading glasses in my shirt pocket), and it was shipped very promptly.</li>
    <li> exactly what I ordered.  My husband liked it very much, not good if you bend down to much as glasses will fall out.</li>
    <li> Works well for me.  The extra reading glasses that I bought online didn&#x27;t come with a case and I didn&#x27;t want a hardcover larger case, because it would take up too much room in my purse. This fits well and protects my glasses.</li>
    <li> Good glass case for my husband, not too wide.  I would like to have had black</li>
    <li> hard to find soft cases. glad I got these now</li>
    <li> to anyone looking for eye glass case with clip. cant beat the price. bought 3. good quality.&lt;br /&gt;Kenneth E cave</li>
    <li> Excellent value for price and is well padded inside. the clip lets you snap it on to your shirt pocket-if you have one</li>
    <li> My son has been looking far a case to put his glasses in his pocket and that one was perfect he is very pleased.</li>
    <li> same thing can&#x60;t find any in stores  been looking for a long time for them  the most inportant thing in his life  to catty them everywhere</li>
    <li> As others have stated, a very nice eyeglass case.  Lined and sturdy, with a strong plastic clip.  Fast shipping.  I would buy this again!</li>
    <li> Beautiful quality for FULL SIZE eyeglasses; however my eyeglasses are more slender, or that new unisex rectangular shape. Sometimes when I bend over they slide out upon the floor.</li>
