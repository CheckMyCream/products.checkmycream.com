      <li>Goes on smoothly; cap stays on tight and does not come off in my purse and the color is beautiful!</li>
      <li>Not too brown, and not too light either.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfect especially if you don&#x27;t really feel like wearing lipstick</li>
      <li>Put it over NYX matte lip cream for extra pigment and it looks very nice.</li>
      <li>it is rich and goes on smooth.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a really nice lip butter the color looks good on dark skinned people</li>
      <li>This lipstick has a velvety rich feel when you put it on.</li>
      <li>i wouldn&#x27;t say this color has lasting power, more like a stronger lip gloss in terms of staying power, however since it enhances my own lip color it wears well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I went right on to Amazon and bought it!</li>
      <li>Package-wise, I say Revlon wins because the cap is secure</li>
      <li>a great year round neutral) and</li>
      <li>fig jam...and lollipop is a great nighttime pop of color all year round...</li>
      <li>if you can wait 3 days its worth it&lt;</li>
      <li>so I mix this in with a chocolate brown lipstick I own to give the color some extra depth.</li>
      <li>I own multiple colors as I&#x27;m a make up junkie!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>Priced right, prompt service.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just right</li>
      <li>I am hispanic with yellow undertones to my skin and some red areas on my face, this color is very nice.  </li>
      <li>they don&#x27;t have the staying power of most lipsticks, but they are very low maintenance, which is what i go for.</li>
      <li>revlon lip butter has been the only lipstick that i have ever been able to wear.</li>
      <li>This product is Exactly as described.  </li>
      <li>First time purchase of colorburst lip butter and is one of my favorites now.  </li>
      <li>Love the lipstick...but the twist mechanism on 2 tubes malfunctioned early on and I had to discard the nearly new tubes.</li>
      <li>This is a warm nude color that works well alone or over other lip products.</li>
      <li>I really missed Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm and this product from Revlon appears to be the same with a better case.  </li>
      <li>you can build it up for a more deep color or leave it sheer for a comfortable day look...</li>
      <li>I really like this lipstick a lot for the shade and texture of it as well.</li>
      <li>I really like this stuff.  </li>
      <li>it is very hydrating.</li>
      <li>my lips dry easily</li>
      <li>This particular color is for those who have fairer skin than myself.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I love this lipstick,a really natural lipstick for a dark skin tone...</li>
      <li>Very natural looking and emollient for brown skin tone.  </li>
      <li>this is such a pretty color of the Revlon colorburst lip butter.  </li>
      <li>I am black but I have light complexion so the color complements my skin tone for a natural appeal that I was searching for in this color.</li>
      <li>i typically wear rich plums to burgandy on my lips.  </li>
      <li>then I would suggest using clear lip gloss over it to get that mocha color</li>
      <li>My lips feel so soft &amp; hydrated</li>
      <li>this has a high shine similar to that of a gloss but not as shiny.</li>
      <li>It has a very buttery consistency and lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>but I buy at least 2 every year to make sure I always have a back up!</li>
      <li>I love this color so much, and am so sad that I can no longer find it in stores</li>
      <li>My mom is 91 years old and used to use this lipstick, but has been unable to find it in stores any longer, and I&#x27;ve tried many stores myself for her.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>is a highly pigmented brown and goes on as a nude or slightly pink depending on your lip pigmentation.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t moisturizing really; in fact it pulls slightly on my lips when applying, but I like the way Vaseline Lip Therapy feels.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Loved the feel and texture but the color is way too light for my medium complexion. I would buy a darker color next time.</li>
    <li> Very nice color, and it is very hydrating.</li>
    <li> I love the collection, just not this color. This particular color is for those who have fairer skin than myself. I&#x27;m a cinnamon brown tone. This leaves me looking washed out when worn alone so I mix this in with a chocolate brown lipstick I own to give the color some extra depth. Overall the feel of the collection is similar to that of lip balm and this has a high shine similar to that of a gloss but not as shiny. I recommend the colorbrust lip butters to any one.</li>
    <li> I love this lipstick,a really natural lipstick for a dark skin tone...i love it,ladies you have to buy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a really nice lip butter the color looks good on dark skinned people&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Must buy!!!!</li>
    <li> This lipstick is amazing!!! My lips feel so soft &amp; hydrated</li>
    <li> Love the texture, color and wearability.</li>
    <li> First time purchase of colorburst lip butter and is one of my favorites now.  Does not dry on lips like other brands.</li>
    <li> I really missed Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm and this product from Revlon appears to be the same with a better case.  I bought several colors and this is my favourite.</li>
    <li> It seems like this product has been discontinued - I can&#x27;t find it in any stores anymore. So thankful I can find it on Amazon!!! This is truly the only lipstick I will ever need again. It&#x27;s super moisturizing, shiny, feels light, and is the perfect color for me!</li>
    <li> Well im not a big fan of this lipstick by its self, I have pigmented lips so it goes on a little grey witch I don&#x27;t like, but when I put a little of clear lipgloss over the color the brown pops out. So over all i do like it but if you have pigmented lips and don&#x27;t like that grayish shimmer then I would suggest using clear lip gloss over it to get that mocha color</li>
    <li> I have a stick of this lipstick and I don&#x27;t like the smell or the taste but I will keep it</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff.  It isn&#x27;t moisturizing really; in fact it pulls slightly on my lips when applying, but I like the way Vaseline Lip Therapy feels. It goes on semi-sheer, isn&#x27;t sticky, and is a perfect neutral for a deep autumn.  I want people to say \\&quot;You look radiant\\&quot; not \\&quot;I like your lip color\\&quot;.  This accomplishes that.</li>
    <li> I love this color and can&#x27;t find it in the store anymore.  It&#x27;s not like wearing lipstick.  It&#x27;s more like wearing chap stick or lip balm.</li>
    <li> I love this color so much, and am so sad that I can no longer find it in stores but I buy at least 2 every year to make sure I always have a back up! Kind of a frosted-brown sugar color, would recommend to those looking for a softer brown shade for summer or spring seasons!</li>
    <li> This color was very hard to find in a store so when I found this for my girlfriend here on Amazon she was thrilled. Bought 3 of them and the shipping was just amazing. It shipped out the same day ordered! She is thrilled with them and overall just a great experience in buying. Priced right, prompt service. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is my second order. I love the Brown Sugar color and very smooth moisturizing ingredient without a taste. I will buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I found this fig jam shade to be the most favorable out of all for me.  Looks really dark but is quite sheer as it&#x27;s not a true lipstick but lip balm type lip color.  The only irritating aspect is that the tube is too hard to open.  I also have the brown sugar shade and definitely the tube is problematic-maybe for me only I don&#x27;t know-as it&#x27;s also hard to open.  I do think the price is a bit steep for a lip balm though.  I read Maybelline&#x27;s Baby Lips is excellent, and certainly the price is lots cheaper so may give that a try.</li>
    <li> Nice color, not moist so it tends to stay in place</li>
    <li> This lipstick has a velvety rich feel when you put it on. This Brown Sugar color is gorgeous. Not too brown, and not too light either. It&#x27;s just right and it lasts for a while too.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect nude shade for women of color. I am a medium brown complexion and it gives just a hint of color. Don&#x27;t care for the shimmer, but will be buying again.</li>
    <li> I really like this lipstick a lot for the shade and texture of it as well.</li>
    <li> revlon lip butter has been the only lipstick that i have ever been able to wear. my lips dry easily and i don&#x27;t like the stickiness or other glosses. brown sugar is my favorite shade but they are all great. they don&#x27;t have the staying power of most lipsticks, but they are very low maintenance, which is what i go for.</li>
    <li> My mom is 91 years old and used to use this lipstick, but has been unable to find it in stores any longer, and I&#x27;ve tried many stores myself for her.&lt;br /&gt;I thought I&#x27;d take long shot and it worked.  Mom is a happy 91 now.</li>
    <li> Some were almost empty</li>
    <li> I love this lipstick...it is a must have in my makeup bag...good color coverage...you can build it up for a more deep color or leave it sheer for a comfortable day look...you can also blend colors to create your very own color thats right for you...I have 5 favorite must have in my collection...I wear sugar plum and cupcake mostly in the summer...in the winter I prefer brown sugar(also a great year round neutral) and fig jam...and lollipop is a great nighttime pop of color all year round...I love love love these lipsticks...</li>
    <li> i have a fair to medium complexion that looks good with saturated pigments.  i typically wear rich plums to burgandy on my lips.  this is a beautiful color, i&#x27;d say it actuallybplays up the color of my own lips.  it is rich and goes on smooth.  i wouldn&#x27;t say this color has lasting power, more like a stronger lip gloss in terms of staying power, however since it enhances my own lip color it wears well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me it is similar to black honey by Clinique.</li>
    <li> used in brdal shower gift great color the girls loved it</li>
    <li> Very natural looking and emollient for brown skin tone.  You can use lip balm or this colored lip butter - works the same, but with a hint of shimmery color.  An everyday thing.  Put it over NYX matte lip cream for extra pigment and it looks very nice.</li>
    <li> Its my most favorite color</li>
    <li> Oh... my... flob! I love this! I saw this in Walmart on Halle Berry and I went right on to Amazon and bought it! It&#x27;s perfect especially if you don&#x27;t really feel like wearing lipstick but you just want something on your lips. It&#x27;s creamy and shiny! TOTALLY love this. I will buy again!</li>
    <li> This product is Exactly as described.  Just like the ones I used to purchase at the store.  I just ordered more!</li>
    <li> this is such a pretty color of the Revlon colorburst lip butter.  I have no idea why they discontinued it.  it goes on creamy and lasts a long time.  a great neutral that goes with many skin tones.</li>
    <li> One of the great colors in the lip butter line by Revlon. I own multiple colors as I&#x27;m a make up junkie!&lt;br /&gt;This is a highly pigmented brown and goes on as a nude or slightly pink depending on your lip pigmentation. It has a very buttery consistency and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I love the color, perfect for me.  What irks me is the packaging.  It&#x27;s very difficult to open with the lower base very small to hold when you pull the top part.</li>
    <li> Goes on smoothly; cap stays on tight and does not come off in my purse and the color is beautiful!</li>
    <li> Love the lipstick...but the twist mechanism on 2 tubes malfunctioned early on and I had to discard the nearly new tubes.</li>
    <li> Buttery just like in the name. Leaves your lips feeling &amp;&#x27; looking moisturized (Told to me by my mom). She insisted I give her my backup</li>
    <li> I bought this and L&#x27;Oreal Colour Riche Le Balm (Caramel Comfort) at the same time. I&#x27;ve seen bloggers say that the Revlon Colorburst Creme Brulee lost to L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Caramel Comfort when they were compared. So, I opted for a darker shade and picked Brown Sugar. When compared to L&#x27;Oreal, I would say the color is more visible but both brands have a great consistency and I love the moisture it packs. Package-wise, I say Revlon wins because the cap is secure and I&#x27;m not worried about keeping it in my purse. This is a warm nude color that works well alone or over other lip products.</li>
    <li> if you can wait 3 days its worth it&lt;br /&gt;i bought this in the store for $8 then lost it on a night out&lt;br /&gt;so happy this was $5 &amp; same quality</li>
    <li> This is a nice product. I am black but I have light complexion so the color complements my skin tone for a natural appeal that I was searching for in this color.</li>
    <li> I am hispanic with yellow undertones to my skin and some red areas on my face, this color is very nice.  Brown Sugar is a very nice nude with a hint of dusky rose.  The perfect neutral.</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing and love the color!</li>
    <li> nice sugar brown light coverage color.</li>
    <li> Why do they always discontinue the products I love?  This lipstick is moisturizing and sheer - perfect!</li>
