    <li> It&#x27;s just like what I need and it came really fast and looked exactly as picture</li>
    <li> This is a great wax warmer for home use. I used to have a La Petite warmer that worked great for many years. Alas, it bit the dust. One caveat for this product is that it is fairly large. For someone used to the La Petite size it seems huge!  Otherwise a great product!</li>
    <li> it does its purpose pretty well.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Affordable price and it fit the wax jar easily. The cap got bent or dented somehow, maybe because of the heat (?) so I would suggest you place the cap balance or in a good place when you are performing wax (not half way in/out)</li>
    <li> This was great price but even on the highest heat it still doesn&#x27;t get hot enough for facial and eyebrow waxing.</li>
    <li> the product came when they said it would . I used it and it works wonderfully , I would recomend it to friends</li>
    <li> Works great. Delivered on time</li>
    <li> Gets wax hot enough to do the job.  If there are problems with wax not melting it may be related to inferior wax products.</li>
    <li> Working well with Cirepil blue wax. Just don&#x27;t know how to clean it...But the way, the instruction is really hard to read.</li>
    <li> Fantastic price beautiful machine. Got two. We usually buy other brands for price yet this one is such a good deal. Could not pass it up. We are impressed.</li>
    <li> I love this wax pot!&lt;br /&gt;It heats and cools very quickly too!</li>
    <li> Love it, the instructions seem to be for Paraffin wax, but it heats my hard wax quickly and keeps the heat consistent. Very easy to clean.</li>
    <li> The product works very good! I am happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I got this for my niece and she loves it. It has help her and she would get another</li>
    <li> was exactly as described</li>
    <li> I ordered this to use at home.  It works well but is somewhat large.  It heats the wax in the metal container if you want.  It is made well and seems as though it will last for years.</li>
    <li> I do a lot of hair removal waxing and this warmer is perfect!  Keeps my hard wax at the correct temp for those tender spots on my clients.  A deal and a half with the price and being prime eligible.  Just bought my second one for strip wax.  I will update if this product has a sudden issue.</li>
    <li> This Chinese made wax warmer is an enigma. I believe that it is a good deal based on its cost and some of its features. I will be modifying it to correct some of its shortcomings and will adapt it for my off-label intentions to melt paraffin for bicycle chains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that being stated:&lt;br /&gt; Plus Features -&lt;br /&gt;  1-removable pot&lt;br /&gt;  2-pot cover&lt;br /&gt;  3-reasonable dead-band on the temperature control (about 8 degrees F)&lt;br /&gt; Minus Features -&lt;br /&gt;  1-the pot cover not an exact fit&lt;br /&gt;  2-the pot handle needs to be bent so that it folds under the pot cover&lt;br /&gt;  3-the info sheet is comical, with English that is horrible (misspellings, uninterpretable sentences, and thanks you for purchasing our ion sprayer)&lt;br /&gt;  4-the power switch and indicator light are held in place with hot melt glue only, which might ultimately fail and become an electrical hazard&lt;br /&gt;  5-the unit label calls for a 2 amp fuse, which is installed, but the 2 provided spare fuses are 5 amps (again, an electrical hazard)&lt;br /&gt;  6-the label and literature states that the device is 150 watts, but it actually draws about 175 watts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this again, unless it fails prematurely, but my reasons are based on my off-label intentions and the remedies that my modifications will make to correct some of the deficiencies.</li>
    <li> Turned it on the first time and it stopped warming the wax after it was on for a while. Tried to turn it back on and it never turned on.</li>
    <li> Love this!!  I&#x27;m saving so much in waxing and it&#x27;s super easy to use and easy to control.</li>
