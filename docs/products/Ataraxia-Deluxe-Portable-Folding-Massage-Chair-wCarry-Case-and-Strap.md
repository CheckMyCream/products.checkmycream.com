    <li> I bought this chair after using a different one for many years. Was swayed by picture that showed exactly how it folded. NO! It is extremely difficult to move the seat and armrest pieces and when you set it on the &amp;#34;lowest&amp;#34; seat setting you still feel as though you are going to fly over the headrest. Having used another I would never choose to put a client on this chair. It would ruin their experience.</li>
    <li> Not well made. If your going to use it for bigger people the quality is an issue. Face cradle broke after 5th use. Complaints made on comfort of face cradle and pillow assembly. Company is willing to sen out face cradle, but I am again not satisfied with the quality or the lack there of. Spoke to manufacturer will not refund monies because I had it for over 30 days (36). Very disappointing and again poor quality. Spend the extra monies.</li>
    <li> Just got this product yesterday and headrest is broken</li>
    <li> bad chair looks home made and is too small .not like me</li>
    <li> The head face  cradle dosent work like it should the bolt moves to much&lt;br /&gt;I would like someone to make this right with the money spent</li>
    <li> The chair is light and easy to transport but I found the face rest hard to adjust and was concerned that it&#x27;s support was plastic. The frame is very sturdy. The adjustments for the padding took a little getting used to but work well. My biggest complaint is that the carry bag that came with it tore within two days of me getting it. If I continue to use it the chair will eventually fall out and become damaged.</li>
    <li> I realy like this chair is very reliable light weight and supper portable. The price of the chair is excellent.</li>
    <li> chair is very good and comfortable. delivery was on time, faster than expected...i am so happy with this purchase...</li>
    <li> Base was bent. Does not adjust smoothly.  Email not responded to. Less than one star. Poor quality carry case. Thin material. Zipper sticks. Will never but equipment online again.</li>
    <li> I totally loved it. It was awesome and a great price as well.</li>
    <li> WISH THE HEAD PIECE WOULD SLIDE DOWN MORE  NOT GOOD FOR ALL CUSTOMERS  ( SHORTER) BUT OTHERWISE EXCELLENT .&lt;br /&gt;NICE CUSHIONS  ARM REST  AND STURDY .</li>
    <li> The carrying case could be a little sturdier since it was already torn a little when it arrived, but seems like a good value so far for the temporary use that we need it for.</li>
    <li> Easy setup. Sturdy. Good entry level for the price. Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Receive with missing screw.</li>

    <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Got it for my husband, and he doesn&#x27;t care for it much, but as a product, it is great quality.</li>
    <li> Great chair for the price.  I am 205 lbs and it feels very solid under me for a massage.  Easily put up and taken down. Great job Ataraxia!</li>
