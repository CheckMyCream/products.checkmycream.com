      <li>This thing gets super super hot!!!  </li>
      <li>Just like my other one, this will give you beautiful beach waves, or spiral curls (depending on the angle</li>
      <li>/&gt;-It is somewhat unclear in the description, but this product comes with the curling wand, a full heat protecting glove (not one of those dinky finger cover ones) as well as 2 salon-style hair clips</li>
      <li>I love the size, nice loose curls.</li>
      <li>Just like its &#x27;little sister&#x27;, this wand heats up fast, does not leave my hair frizzy and makes perfect, long-lasting curls!</li>

      <li>It gets really hot</li>
      <li>This one is just as good as my Jose Eber wand and at half the price!</li>

      <li>otherwise it gets hot pretty fast and comes with a heat glove and of course it&#x27;s pink! :)</li>

      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend for beginners.</li>
      <li>Hot enough, does the job.  </li>
      <li>I wanted pretty waves and didn&#x27;t think it was possible because my hair is stick straight and long.</li>
      <li>I have owned the Le Angelique 13-25mm curling wand for a few months and love it so after a few sub-par hairstyles resulting from a traditional 1 1/4&amp;#34; curling iron, I decided to go ahead and purchase this 32mm Le Angelique curling wand.</li>

<li> Not hot enough to hold a curl all day.</li>
<li> if you have very long hair, buy both the 32mm size and the 25mm size.  </li>
<li> Just be careful and wear long sleeves and pants when you use it!!!</li>
<li> I burned my arm just out of not really knowing how to use it yet.  </li>
<li> The power switch had a short, and smelled like a burned electrical smell after being plugged in for a few minutes.  </li>
<li> It took me a few tries to get used to it</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t like the wand that gets narrow at the tip because my hair would slide down the barrel and bunch up at the bottom.</li>
<li> The Remington wand was 1/2\\&quot; - 1\\&quot; and gave me WAY too tight curls.</li>
<li> This is going to take some practice to get down!</li>
<li> A few additional notes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> so if ur not used to a clip less curling iron I will advise to use the glove!</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure why they don&#x27;t</li>
<li> I love the curls, but holy crap I have burned myself 3 times with this thing and bad!</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t have anything bad to say about it except I wish it had a temp choice like other irons.</li>
<li> Ill now be using it weekly to switch up my look.</li>

    <li> Love it! With shoulder length hair it creates great curls.I love the size, nice loose curls. The glove is nice, I definitely burn my hand. Heats up quickly.</li>
    <li> Great size, light, well packaged, includes nice clips and gloves.  BUT IT DIDN&#x27;T WORK.  The power switch had a short, and smelled like a burned electrical smell after being plugged in for a few minutes.  I will probably try to order another and give it a second try.  Hopefully, this was a fluke and not indicative of a low quality product.</li>
    <li> Not hot enough to hold a curl all day. Save your money, get a NuMe, gets way hotter.</li>
    <li> This curling wand is PERFECT! I got the Remington Pearl curling wand before i bought this one and didn&#x27;t like it one bit. I didn&#x27;t like the wand that gets narrow at the tip because my hair would slide down the barrel and bunch up at the bottom. This barrel keeps my hair uniform throughout the wand, giving me even waves. The size (32mm which I believe is 1.25 inches) is perfect too. The Remington wand was 1/2\\&quot; - 1\\&quot; and gave me WAY too tight curls. Couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better than this wand - it heats up fast, comes with useful clips, and gives me beautiful curls!</li>
    <li> This is my first curling wand and it is fantastic !! Highly recommend for beginners. Gives really beautiful curls and and holds them for a long time !!</li>
    <li> I got this in the mail yesterday and tried it out immediately. I have a smaller Jose Eber one that I love but wanted something bigger and didnt want to pay that much again. This one is just as good as my Jose Eber wand and at half the price! I highly recommend it. Just like my other one, this will give you beautiful beach waves, or spiral curls (depending on the angle you hold it) that will stay in until you wash your hair. The second day is the best because the curl relaxes and looks natural and beautiful! Im a hairstylist and love using these on clients! The result, no matter what type of hair Im working with, is always amazing!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t have anything bad to say about it except I wish it had a temp choice like other irons. otherwise it gets hot pretty fast and comes with a heat glove and of course it&#x27;s pink! :)</li>
    <li> When this arrived I was worried the barrel was too big, but I&#x27;ve been using this for months now and I absolutely LOVE it.  I can curl my hair fast and it creates gorgeous loose curls.  I&#x27;ll post a picture!</li>
    <li> Great wand. Perfect NUME dupe. Gets super hot. I&#x27;ve had this for a while and haven&#x27;t had any issues with it.</li>
    <li> I really like this curling iron. It took me a few tries to get used to it but I love the curls it gives my hair (think more along the lines of beach waves). Glove is a must with this curler though! I&#x27;ve burned myself a couple of times but it was my fault for not paying attention.</li>
    <li> I am a hair dresser!  This is a wonderful curling wand.  It gets super hot, was delivered fast, came with a glove (which I never use) and it feels like a quality product.  I also ordered another wand in a smaller size, and it was cheaper, but it FELT cheaper.  I am very happy with my purchase and I tell all of my clients they need to buy a wand!!!  Here&#x27;s a tip.  if you have very long hair, buy both the 32mm size and the 25mm size.  You will like both of them.  If you have medium length hair, buy a 25mm wand.  The 32mm wand is much better for very long hair.  &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> i use it all the time! im in love! im glad i purchased it, it was so inexspensive too thank you</li>
    <li> Like design and  color</li>
    <li> This curling wand was exactly what i wanted and arrived early. I wanted pretty waves and didn&#x27;t think it was possible because my hair is stick straight and long. I originally purchased this wand to do my hair for a wedding and it turned out better than i expected. Ill now be using it weekly to switch up my look.</li>
    <li> This curling iron give big bouncy waves! It gets really hot so if ur not used to a clip less curling iron I will advise to use the glove! For curling the hair please count to 7 then release the curl from the barrel, we want healthy curls not burnt curls! Lol I highly recommend! Also used a heat protectant before usage!</li>
    <li> Love this wand. I do think all wands should start coming with stands though. I&#x27;m not sure why they don&#x27;t so you don&#x27;t burn your counters. Anyone know why?</li>
    <li> Good iron.  Hot enough, does the job.  (I&#x27;ve got long, fine hair)  Cute packaging, too.  I&#x27;m keeping that for travel.  Good price.  Wish it had a stand to keep the heat off the counter.  Good thing I have granite.</li>
    <li> Love this curling wand. I have fine hair that won&#x27;t hold a curl but this definitely helps them stay longer.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the size of the barrel, exactly what I was looking for. Easy to use. And I love how 2 pink clips were included. Now I can finally achieve the big curls I&#x27;ve always wanted. ❤️</li>
    <li> Loved it! And I loved how it came with a glove and hair clips too. Use this wand all the time!</li>
    <li> I have owned the Le Angelique 13-25mm curling wand for a few months and love it so after a few sub-par hairstyles resulting from a traditional 1 1/4&amp;#34; curling iron, I decided to go ahead and purchase this 32mm Le Angelique curling wand. Just like its &#x27;little sister&#x27;, this wand heats up fast, does not leave my hair frizzy and makes perfect, long-lasting curls! If you are looking for looser, yet still polished curls, this is the product you should get (think Emily Thorne/Amanda Clarke on &#x27;Revenge&#x27; hair). A few additional notes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-It is somewhat unclear in the description, but this product comes with the curling wand, a full heat protecting glove (not one of those dinky finger cover ones) as well as 2 salon-style hair clips&lt;br /&gt;-Hold the wand upside down as you curl for best results, meaning the handle of the wand should be closest to your scalp&lt;br /&gt;-the hair must be spread out on the wand (think about how a stylist spreads the hairs out while he/she paints color on for foils) as you wrap it because if it is all held together (like rope), you will get waves instead of curls</li>
    <li> Great product. , very pleased..does the job...my hair looks wonderful. Very easy to use I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product.</li>
    <li> I love the curls, but holy crap I have burned myself 3 times with this thing and bad! Not on my hands but on my arm and then on my leg. This thing gets super super hot!!!  It doesn&#x27;t sit nicely on my vanity.  It rolls around and that&#x27;s how I burned my leg.  It fell off the vanity.  I burned my arm just out of not really knowing how to use it yet.  This is going to take some practice to get down! Just be careful and wear long sleeves and pants when you use it!!!</li>
