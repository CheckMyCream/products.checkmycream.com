    <li> I paid $200 in salon to have my hair done Brazilian style....well I need not ever bother again. This is awesome! You must follow all directions to have it be effective but you get the salon results. Let me tell you this is not like the cheap $30 stuff you get in any store that claims to be brazilian. This is real deal so Ur not wasting your money.</li>
    <li> Just love it! It is very simple to use following the instructions and also watching the video.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it several times on myself, sister and friends and everyone was completely satisfied and very happy with the results. They even had it done more than one.&lt;br /&gt;It works much better than other brands that it tried.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work properly . I lost my clients due to this kind of keratin although I have bought it many times same kind with different types of hair  but this time doesn&#x27;t work ad usual . That&#x27;s why I have to return it .</li>
    <li> I did not see any difference to my hair is still fluffy</li>
    <li> I like it leaves your hear very soft.</li>
    <li> I love it!  I have paid $250 in salons and this has given me the same result. It has been two months and I live in SE Louisiana where the humidity is ridiculous. I make sure to use sulfate free and is very pleased.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this 3 times now and it makes my hair so shiny and healthy looking. My hair is so damaged and dry, but this makes it actually look healthy again! I love it. It doesn&#x27;t last as long as a professional blowout, I&#x27;d say it probably lasts about 4 weeks or so. But doing this once a month saves hundreds versus going to the salon. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 star review is because when you&#x27;re applying the solution to your hair, the fumes burn your eyes and nose. I always do this in a well ventilated area with an overhead fan going and a table fan blowing also, but it still makes my eyes water. So just wanted to give a heads up to buyers who might not be able to handle that. Anyway, for the price I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Use this for my daughters and I get salon results!</li>
    <li> Its straightening effect is about 80 % which is not bad and it stays up to 3 months. But the formaldehyde in it is very strong and hurts the eyes badly.</li>
    <li> very satisfied with the product and your service was very good ty&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  darl</li>
    <li> Worked very well on my hair. Easy to apply and fantastic to be able to wash it out after 24 hours.</li>
