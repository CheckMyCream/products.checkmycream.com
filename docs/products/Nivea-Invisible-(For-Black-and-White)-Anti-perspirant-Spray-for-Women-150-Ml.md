    <li> The best deordorant . Too bad it&#x27;s not found where I live</li>
    <li> I love the application, but unfortunately it does not provide as much protection as an anti-antiperspirant.</li>
    <li> Struggled for years to find something that worked as well as a product I used in the UK - this is very close, dries quickly without white marks.</li>
    <li> Finally I have found a deodorant that doesn&#x27;t leave yellow stains on white or white marks on black! Smells and works great and leaves skin smooth.</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant. It is invisible and it works for about 2 days.</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant and the delivery was right on time. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Excellent protection love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a repeated consumer of this product</li>
    <li> LOVE this deodorant.  Bought it in France first. Could not get it here other than online, but smaller than France size.  For those interested it contains Aluminum Chorohydrate.</li>
    <li> Even better than I expected. I first used Nivea products in France over 40 years ago. Great quality then and now. The fragrance is very clean and pleasant without being obvious. It does what it should and lasts a looooong time. Dries very quickly and does not show on clothing. A bonus, a little seems to go a long way. The spray is controlled going where it should and not all over the room. The top opens by twisting so it never gets lost or ornery. Good product.</li>
    <li> They shipped fast to the mail. I couldn&#x27;t get this product anywhere but amazon, thank god they sell here because aresols are not legal to sell overseas. The price could be a little lower, its just a tad bit much for only 150ml! But whatever im happy i got my stuff.</li>
    <li> Smells and works great</li>
    <li> Nice, but I like the men&#x27;s version much better!</li>
    <li> This spray deodorant is my go to .  It is easy to use, with no scent and does not mark your black or white clothes- I first discovered it in Italy and luckily Amazon has it because it is not available in the stores</li>
    <li> Fresh and nice smell. Great protection</li>
    <li> Love the smell, very good protection. Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> This deodorant is AMAZING. My friend brought it over from Spain for me and I fell in love with it and had to order more. It&#x27;s the only deodorant that stays all day long and doesn&#x27;t stain any of my clothes, and I sweat a lot. Smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> No residue on my clothes!  Dries fast.  Lasts less than  day on me.  Not a deodorant, just an antiperspirant.  So use something else in addition if that&#x27;s an issue.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes like other antiperspirants and deodorants do. I put it on in the morning and on a moderate day it will last all day, now if I&#x27;m super active that day I may have to reapply it once again. Overall though a great buy. I have been using this for the last three years now and I wouldn&#x27;t go back to deodorant if I had to. And the fragrance is fabulous, a very fresh light scent.</li>
    <li> This is the best product deodorant that I have found.  Leaves no white residue and keeps you fresh all day long even in the heat.  I found this product in Hong Kong and it should be sold in stores within the US and TRAVEL SIZES would be great too!</li>
    <li> The best, never have to worry about white marks ever again.</li>
