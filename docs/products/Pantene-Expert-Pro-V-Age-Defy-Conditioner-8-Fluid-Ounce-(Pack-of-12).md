      <li>I happily found it on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed a great difference in the thickening lotion on my hair</li>
      <li>and we have been happy using these products -</li>
      <li>The conditioner is great.  </li>
      <li>One of the things I liked best was that I no longer had to use conditioner or detangler, as my hair combed out with no problem after washing.</li>
      <li>I used it with the matching conditioner and the results are fantastic!!!</li>
      <li>It is a very nice shampoo</li>
      <li>Very nice shampoo smells good.</li>
      <li>I will say that the scent of the shampoo is pleasant, but I&#x27;ve come to expect that from Pantene.  </li>
      <li>and the fragrance was pleasant without overpowering.  </li>
      <li>But this shampoo is as good as the rest of their line.</li>
      <li>Really good shampoo.  </li>
      <li>It has a great scent too, so many shampoos are overly flowery and not in a good way.</li>
      <li>They have commented that my hair looks great and I am so pleased.</li>
      <li>Love that!</li>
      <li>LOVE Pantene Pro-V Age-Defying Shampoo as well as the Pantene Age-Defying Conditioner!</li>
      <li>It is so effective I&#x27;ve even been able to reduce the amount of time I spend with my curling iron!</li>
      <li>nothing amazing.</li>
      <li>While the product does rinse out amazingly well and adds marginal volume, it&#x27;s sulfate based and for me, it is drying.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be honest, I don&#x27;t notice any thickening of the hair.  </li>
      <li>No one should expect miracles, and this is a nice shampoo.  </li>
      <li>but honestly I can&#x27;t see any difference</li>
      <li>it is: the kind of curl</li>
      <li>and it still allows me to brush out my hair nicely after</li>
      <li>Nice shampoo, lathers nice.</li>
      <li>I brush from crown to ear lobe with a nice twist at the cheek and--</li>
      <li>I honestly think that it has improved the 5 issues I had</li>
      <li>I consider this a very good product, probably one of the most useful things I got to try on Amazon.</li>
      <li>This is my new best friend.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still working and still like to be presentable to my students, which means the Pantene Agedefy shampoo is my new best friend in the shower stall.</li>
      <li>Love the way this shampoo is gentle and yet cleanses so well, leaving your hair feeling great!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now and can honestly say I love the stuff.</li>
      <li>I found that I liked it even more with the accompanying products.</li>
      <li>After washing, my hair feels strong and good smell :)</li>
      <li>I gave this rating because on my first use of the product it was great, so I am just waiting for the end results after I have completed the content of the bottle.  </li>
      <li>If your hair is fine, don&#x27;t use this product!</li>
      <li>Love this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>I am assuming it is okay</li>
      <li>This product works well with my hair, although I don&#x27;t see that I have thicker hair or more prolific growth.  </li>
      <li>and I think my hair has more static when I use it.</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>My hair did seem to be brighter in color and was shinier, a bit more silky and had more body.</li>
      <li>What&#x27;s not to love about any Pantene product?</li>
      <li>Dullness seems to be better; hair is shinier.</li>
      <li>you might be ok without conditioner.</li>
      <li>My hair has never looked better</li>
      <li>It truly delivers as well (better?)</li>
      <li>With mostly salt and pepper hair (silver), this works well.</li>
      <li>Nothing helped for more than 1 or 2 treatments.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
      <li>hair has a tendency for the top layer to become frizzy, and this shampoo tamed that tendency.  </li>
      <li>It does what it promised and gave me fuller and more voluminous hair</li>
      <li>After a hair cut, it worked even better.</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>I really love this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>Okay, I&#x27;ve been using both products the shampoo and conditioner for over two weeks</li>
      <li>Absolutely love this shampoo.</li>
      <li>The burning and itching lasted for the better part of two weeks.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a shampoo and conditioner for my hair that would work better on my greys.</li>
      <li>It seems to stay better looking longer throughout the day and holds my curl longer.  </li>
      <li>I think most women would like it.</li>
      <li>After using it twice, my hair felt softer, fuller and has more movement.  </li>
      <li>I purchased these items because of the many glowing reviews at Amazon.  </li>
      <li>I was also pleased with the price and speedy delivery.</li>
      <li>I tried all sorts of products, in all sorts of price ranges and none has made my hair feel more like it used to than this product.</li>
      <li>So, I would say that these products do most of what they say.  </li>
      <li>It worked better when combined with their hair thickening treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say that this is any better than Suave.  </li>
      <li>This product delivers healthy hair.</li>
      <li>This product delivers healthy hair.t all overpowering.  </li>
      <li>I love bed head and will stick with that.</li>
      <li>one of best shamppos I used in recent times.</li>
      <li>I color my hair about 2-3x/year, and while I love the color, the process does make the hair feel more brittle.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> What&#x27;s not to love about any Pantene product?</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this shampoo. My thin, drab hair has now become full, shiny and looks great.</li>
    <li> Nice shampoo, lathers nice. Leaves&lt;br /&gt;hair clean.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great! I highlight my hair every 5 to 6 weeks and really found it makes my hair softer and more manageable!  Thank you for a great product</li>
    <li> Love the way this shampoo is gentle and yet cleanses so well, leaving your hair feeling great! I use this in conjunction with Pantene&#x27;s Age Defying Conditioner. With mostly salt and pepper hair (silver), this works well. I would highly recommend this product and seller!</li>
    <li> one of best shamppos I used in recent times. After washing, my hair feels strong and good smell :)</li>
    <li> Great price for a product I use regularly. On my long [almost waist-length] silver &amp; blond hair, it gives me the kind of results I like. Soft without being fly away or &amp;#34;mushy&amp;#34;, a healthy shine, manageable, and thickness that other shampoos don&#x27;t give me.&lt;br /&gt;Used with the conditioner, my wash and wear hear is easy to manage, static free even in dry indoor heat.</li>
    <li> Terrible!  Makes your hair feel like straw and after a few weeks of use my scalp has red itchy sores. Would not recommend  saw no benefit or change in my hair</li>
    <li> I knew I would like the product because I&#x27;ve been using it for a while, it&#x27;s just that I can&#x27;t find it locally anymore.  I was also pleased with the price and speedy delivery. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Although this is inexpensive, it just does not provide the moisture I get from higher quality shampoos. I love bed head and will stick with that.</li>
    <li> Product as described, fair price, well packed, fast delivery</li>
    <li> This product works well with my hair, although I don&#x27;t see that I have thicker hair or more prolific growth.  I would recommend this product to anyone who has fine hair and wants more body in it.  No one should expect miracles, and this is a nice shampoo.  It arrived on time in perfect condition</li>
    <li> Great shampoo.  Makes my hair easy to manage.  Grays aren&#x27;t so unruly.</li>
    <li> Great product--seems to perform as advertised.</li>
    <li> Tried a small sample that came in mail.  Loved what it did to my hair, very soft and smooth, so I purchased the full size.  Still lovin it!</li>
    <li> Works great for me. I have fine, frizzy, thin, grey hair. It is smooth and sleek after using both the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> best I have found for my colored aging hair</li>
    <li> This product and it&#x27;s partners, conditioner and thickening lotion do what they promise.  After two days of use I had more volume and less breakage of hair.  After a month there is quite a difference.  I highly recommend these products.</li>
    <li> I find that this product helps keep my hair hydrated and soft.  I will purchase this again in the future.</li>
    <li> This is great shampoo. Since I have been using Pantene Pro-V Age Defy shampoo, my hair looks and feels healthier. It has restored my hairs&#x27; shine and helped it have more body. I have long hair and before I started using this, my hair looked dull and it seemed to tangle easily. Pantene Pro-V Age Defy shampoo  has made my hair smoother and more full of life, and more manageable.</li>
    <li> that is 5 time that I bought this shampoo very good</li>
    <li> I am a little below the targeted range for this shampoo (I am 29). However, I can definitely benefit from the effects that this shampoo promises. So, I decided to give it a try. It is supposed to help Breakage, Split Ends, Frizz, Unruly Grays, Lackluster Color, Thin Look, and Dryness. I have 5 of the 7 issues (no grays or dryness here).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After just one wash I noticed that my hair looked fantastic. It actually felt and looked thicker. It was super shiny, smooth and felt amazingly healthy. The next day I picked up the conditioner and treatment to use with the shampoo. I found that I liked it even more with the accompanying products. I have been using this for a little over a week now and I love it. I honestly think that it has improved the 5 issues I had (Breakage, Split Ends, Frizz, Lackluster Color and Thin Look). I would recommend trying this shampoo for anyone who wants to improve the condition of their hair.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say I noticed any notable change upon using this shampoo--nothing for the worse and nothing for the better.  It seems to work fine.  The only minor thing I dislike is the color of the shampoo. It&#x27;s a light golden color, which would probably look fine coming out of a light colored bottle.  But coming out of a black bottle it makes me think of mucus.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Pantene products for years, and have always liked them very much, so i may be biased. But this shampoo is as good as the rest of their line. Works great, lathers well, makes my hair look soft and shiny. That&#x27;s all I expect it to do, and it does it very well!</li>
    <li> I received this product for free to review from the Amazon Vine program. I ordered this shampoo to review because I am a satisfied user of other Pantene hair products. My family uses the Classic brand Pantene shampoo.  I use the Pantene shampoo for color treated hair and sometimes a Pentene conditioner as well.  They work well and we have been happy using these products - but I never noticed any obvious scent with those brands. This particular shampoo smelled so strong of a perfume-like scent that even in the shower I could wash it out of my hair fast enough.  I can&#x27;t tell you how it left my hair looking because I never got that far.  There is no way I personally would ever wear something with that strong of a scent.  I just don&#x27;t think it is healthy for me or the people around me to breath in a strong, artificial scent like that all day long.</li>
    <li> As far as the \\&quot;specialty\\&quot; style hair care products go, this one isn&#x27;t too crazily priced, although it&#x27;s obviously several dollars more than the cheap store brands. After using Pantene&#x27;s \\&quot;Age Defy\\&quot; for a few weeks I can report has had a positive effect, and I&#x27;m experiencing much less frizz than normal with my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the smell goes, it&#x27;s actually quite pleasant without going overboard like the dollar shampoos with scents like \\&quot;Mandarin Breeze\\&quot; or whatever. You shouldn&#x27;t expect to go from full-gray back to dark brunette, but it&#x27;s definitely worth trying if the standard shampoo options aren&#x27;t giving you the shine or frizz-free look you want.</li>
    <li> And I do think it has helped..my hair is definitely not getting any thinner and it does seem thicker..although it could also be due to the Kefir I have started drinking daily..it help with hair growth too..why, I have no idea!</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo in combination with the rest of the Age Defy line. I got the best price through Amazon, using the &amp;#34;Subscribe and Save.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this shampoo a lot. It is gentle enough for me to use every day. And with the leave-in treatment, I find that I do need to wash my hair every day to prevent little white flakes when I comb my hair. It has a gentle scent and leaves my hair soft.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo...very nice and clean scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This, along with the entire line of products for thinning hair have really transformed my hair literally over night!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase again!</li>
    <li> Great product.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> The name of this product says it ALL.  After trying the shampoo and the rejuvenating hydration masque, I am back to Pantene for life!!!  I use the entire line.  All I can say to Pantene is &amp;#34;where have YOU been with THIS?&amp;#34;  Don&#x27;t you dare stop making this!  This is a product line you will do well to you earlier than &amp;#34;age&amp;#34; may indicate.  You won&#x27;t believe how long this stays and defies the affects and signs of age?  (You will want to wash your hair nearly every day whether you need it or not.)</li>
    <li> My hair is thin and fine. This product makes it seem more full and easier to style and hold it&#x27;s shape.</li>
    <li> Good stuff overall. No complaints.  Haven&#x27;t noticed it helps fly away grays though.</li>
    <li> TOO DULLING  AND STICKEY</li>
    <li> LOVE Pantene Pro-V Age-Defying Shampoo as well as the Pantene Age-Defying Conditioner! Bought it just about a month ago. My somewhat thin, 68-year-old hair feels better than ever, has nice body, and the color of my hair, white, has never looked so beautiful, thanks to your Shampoo and Conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks. Pantene!</li>
    <li> my hair was always silky soft... until I got these crazy white kinky hairs with a mind of their own. I tried all sorts of products, in all sorts of price ranges and none has made my hair feel more like it used to than this product. People have noticed. They have commented that my hair looks great and I am so pleased. I just wish the larger bottles were more readily available.</li>
    <li> Wonderful for your hair!</li>
    <li> This shampoo works well enough, leaving my hair tangle-free and soft, and without leaving it greasy or limp.  I can&#x27;t say I noticed any difference from many other shampoos, so I&#x27;ll give this 4 stars instead of 5.  It&#x27;s a nice product and decent value and I&#x27;d buy it in the future, but, really, it&#x27;s nothing spectacular.</li>
    <li> This is very luxurious!  Very thick shampoo, makes your hair very silky and smooth!</li>
    <li> I have been on some anti seizure medication that causes my hair to thin and break easily.  I have been using vitamins, drinking more water, changing my diet, trying every single hair care product on the market, switched to satin pillowcases, wearing a sleep cap, no heat tools, etcetera for my hair.  My hairdresser told me to keep my hair moisturized in order to stop all the breaking.  I saw this product and thought why not give it a whirl.  I&#x27;m getting married in a year and I would really like to have long healthy locks to style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I have been using the shampoo, conditioner and the cream that you put on afterward.  The consistency of the shampoo is very thick and doesn&#x27;t lather like most shampoos.  It rather smooths on.  The conditioner is also very thick and while the bottle does not give any directions to use, my hairstylist recommends letting sit for 3 minutes, combing through with a wide toothed comb and then rinsing with cooler water.  Hot water is your hair&#x27;s enemy.  When I leave the shower I use the anti age cream by pantene which is a liquid spritz, I spray three spritzes down my center part, and then lift my hair with a comb and spritz several more times along the roots.  I let my hair air dry for about 10 minutes before using any sort or hair dryer or styling aides.  Sometimes I use a blow dry speed up spray from Kenra so that I am not blow drying my hair for extended periods of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this Pantene system for almost four weeks.  I have less hair in my comb.  Less hair pulls out when I take out ponytails.  My hair looks fuller and thicker from the roots all the way down to the ends.  My hair is extremely shiny and bouncy.  My hairdresser wondered how much I was paying to keep my hair moisturized.  My ends are not snagging and breaking like they have in the past, they are very smooth and snag free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is not as flowery as Pantene normally is.  It is very clean as you can expect from Pantene, but not at all overpowering.  This product may or may not reverse aging, but it definitely has kept my hair healthier then it was and it is keeping my dreams alive that I can grow it out.  This product delivers healthy hair.t all overpowering.

    <li> This is one of the few shampoos I&#x27;ve used that actually lives up to its promises! After using it for a few days, I did notice a difference. My hair wasn&#x27;t as frizzy and the gray hair wasn&#x27;t as unruly. One of the things I liked best was that I no longer had to use conditioner or detangler, as my hair combed out with no problem after washing. Love that! My only complaint was I couldn&#x27;t skip a day between washings, as my hair is a little oily and whatever ingredients used to control the frizz made my hair a little oily-looking the second day. Will definitely be buying this for myself!</li>
    <li> I used this for a week+ with no other hair products, to see if I really felt it did anything for \\&quot;unruly grey hair\\&quot; as I have a head full of that. It did fine, I felt that my hair was \\&quot;smoother\\&quot;. I have some natural curl that thankfully this product did NOT deaden that down as some products seem to leave more on your hair than others do and I did not feel this way about this shampoo. It has a great scent too, so many shampoos are overly flowery and not in a good way. I&#x27;ve used Pantene products for years and felt this was in keeping with the typical quality of their products.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a shampoo and conditioner for my hair that would work better on my greys. Though I dye my hair and have for nearly 20 years, the greys are always a little wiry, harder to control. I&#x27;m at about 35% grey right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo actually controls them better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried thus far. I started using it when I needed a trim, and it helped control frizz. After a hair cut, it worked even better. When I dyed my hair, I discovered I didn&#x27;t have any color treated shampoo, so I used this and it was terrific. It&#x27;s gentle, with a good scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t get any extra body from the shampoo, but lustre and frizz control are well worth it. I definitely recommend giving this a try.</li>
    <li> After using the entire bottle, I did find that my hair had improved in terms of overall texture and manageability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair has a tendency for the top layer to become frizzy, and this shampoo tamed that tendency.  It was notable, since that was the case even when I let it air dry.  Some of the other noted benefits of using this shampoo were less apparent to me since I do not have gray or dull hair - but it cleaned it well and left it shiny as well as manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is a bit different than other shampoos I&#x27;m used to - a bit more like that of some conditioners - however it lathered well and the fragrance was pleasant without overpowering.  Men or women could use this equally without feeling like they were wearing perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, it went on easily, was easily rinsed, and left me with clean hair that was better-behaved than before.</li>
    <li> suds up well, hair feels strong after use, a decent scent-not overpowering.  I&#x27;ve used other panetene products in the past and this in is yet another I will buy in the future.</li>
    <li> To me, this product has a kinda funny smell so I&#x27;m still trying to get used to that, works well on my hair though.</li>
    <li> I am 54 and about 30% grey. I have been using pantene for about as long I can remember. So here I go. I bought shampoo and conditioner. It did tame my grey hair but my hair was dull ,weighed down and just plain drab. No silky smooth feeling at all. My hair also was falling out more than usual. I used it for 2 weeks to give it a chance. Washed my hair today with good ole regular pantene and it feels good to be back to smooth and silky, and I will live with my unruly grey hair.: )</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Pantene products for years.  When any product claims to \\&quot;Age-Defy\\&quot; and help hair with split ends and other problems, it&#x27;s going to take more than 30 days of testing to see if the product can live up to its claims.  Given that I am a Senior Citizen with other age-related issues going on, it&#x27;s taking me longer than that to analyze the claims of this product.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I still like Pantene.  I just tend to be skeptical  of any product&#x27;s claims nowadays.</li>
    <li> I gave this rating because on my first use of the product it was great, so I am just waiting for the end results after I have completed the content of the bottle.  I haven&#x27;t noticed a great difference in the thickening lotion on my hair but I look forward to the end results of that as well.  The conditioner is great.  It has really brought the texture of my grade of hair texture back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> Very nice shampoo smells good. I used it with the matching conditioner and the results are fantastic!!! No other products needed to get great results. My color, blow dry, curling iron treated hair loves this product and looks healthy. Not oily or weighted down.</li>
    <li> My hair is only a little gray, so I may not be the best candidate for this shampoo - I&#x27;m not entirely happy with it, which may be because of the non-gray hairs.  It definitely adds smoothness and shine - my pre-gray hair was always quite shiny, but in recent years, lost some of its gloss (perhaps because of hard water?), and I was very pleased to see the shininess back.  However, my non-gray hair is also fine and limp, and this shampoo adds too much smoothness for that type of hair, emphasizing its lack of body.  So anyone with mostly gray hair, which is thicker and coarser, may be pleased, but it&#x27;s perhaps not the solution for mixed hair.</li>
    <li> This shampoo works really well with my hair, which is very fine, dry and thin.  After using it twice, my hair felt softer, fuller and has more movement.  I have a collection of more expensive shampoos in my shower, such as Fekkai, Kerastasse and Nioxin, and none of them come close to giving similar results as Age Defy did.  All the volumizing formulas dried out my hair and made it impossible to brush out and actually left it more limp than before.  I use about a teaspoon amount, add some water and massage it onto my scalp.  It lathers really well after massaging it evenly on my head for about a minute.  I don&#x27;t use a conditioner and it still allows me to brush out my hair nicely after I towel dried it.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all, which is amazing for by baby fine hair.  I give it 4 stars only because of the steep price.  $8 for a bottle of shampoo is a lot for me, but since I use a small amount and wash my hair every 2 or 3 days, it&#x27;s worth it for me.  I actually like how it looks on the second day better, where it&#x27;s softer and smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried the thickening treatment.  It does what it promised and gave me fuller and more voluminous hair but it contains alcohol denat, an ingredient that I&#x27;m not familiar with and it raised some questionable side effects, thus, I&#x27;m holding off on it for now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> Really good shampoo.  It&#x27;s golden in color and low on scent, which to me is a great thing.  A little goes a long way.  It&#x27;s easy to rinse it out of your hair, and leaves your hair feeling good, not super tangled after use.  But, the best thing about it is that it seems to just melt other hair products away effortlessly.  I tend to use a lot of hair spray, and with other shampoos, as I wash my hair I can feel the tugging on my roots from my rubbing the shampoo around.  Some shampoos have actually left hairspray residue behind with one washing.  Not with this product.  It removes hairspray gently and instantly.  Since my poor roots, what&#x27;s left of them, could use some babying, I just love this product!  I&#x27;ll be honest, I don&#x27;t notice any thickening of the hair.  But what I do notice, TLC to the hair, has me sold.  And the price here on Amazon is just extraordinary.  Give this a try.  Don&#x27;t expect miracles, but do expect a product that helps leave your hair soft and manageable and seems to me to be much less likely to produce hair breakage.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t know how to rate this as I just received it and haven&#x27;t used it yet. I am assuming it is okay and it may be great - I just don&#x27;t know yet. There should be a star that says &amp;#34;haven&#x27;t used it yet&amp;#34; if you want an opinion this quickly. Give people a week or two to try the product, then send them the reviews to comment on.</li>
    <li> I have baby fine hair, so I&#x27;m always looking for a decent volumizing shampoo. This claims to give your hair some \\&quot;extra fullness\\&quot; and help prevent split-ends and breakage. The perfect shampoo for me...or so I thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair felt soft and healthy before I used Pro-V Expert. After using it my hair felt dry, brittle, and very fragile. It was so tangled and dry that I couldn&#x27;t even get my widetooth comb through it. I used a deep conditioner to try and bring it back to life, but it was useless. Not only did Pro-V Expert fail to reduce breakage and split-ends, it actually caused my hair to break!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mother also tried this shampoo and the same thing happened to her hair - it felt like a brillo pad!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To top it all off, I suffered a horrible allergic reaction. My scalp began to itch and burn within 5-10 minutes of leaving the shower. My scalp actually became quite pink and started to swell a bit. The burning and itching lasted for the better part of two weeks. My doctor suggested that the citric acid and caffeine in this shampoo were what caused my allergic reaction. Like one of the other reviewers, I was actually left with scabs on my head because of the citric acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo may work wonders for some, but if you have sensitive skin, be careful, carry out a skin test - like you would with hair dye - before using.</li>
    <li> I really love this shampoo.  It makes your hair soft and shiny.  I don&#x27;t need conditioner with this shampoo.  It is very nourishing.</li>
    <li> Silicone in hair care products can do a number of things.  It can make the hair appear smoother and less frizzy and it can make split ends less noticeable.  It can definitely add shine.  In fact, silicone is the active ingredient in most of the \\&quot;shine\\&quot; products (sprays and oils) on the market.  It does this by coating the hair, which for me presents a problem.  I have a lot of hair but the texture is fine, and I find that products with silicone tend to weigh it down, making it too flat and stick straight.  When I used this shampoo my hair was soft, but it had a funny feel to it - almost like a synthetic wig.  I also found that my styling products didn&#x27;t work as well, probably because they couldn&#x27;t penetrate the silicone coating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So is silicone a bad thing?  Many hairdressers seem to prefer products that are silicone free, or at least contain only a minimal amount.  My hairdresser swears that if you use products containing silicone frequently, that you will experience build-up and other styling products will be less effective.  I could see where some hair types might find the coating effect beneficial.  If you feel that your hair has a very coarse texture or you are trying to smooth some curls or waves, this might give you more control.  I would still recommend that you alternate it with another shampoo to avoid any build-up, and those with fine hair who want extra body should probably give this a pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few other things to consider:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-This is NOT a sulfate-free shampoo&lt;br /&gt;-There is a scent, but I didn&#x27;t find it overwhelming or distinctly feminine&lt;br /&gt;-I think that $13.00 is steep for this product.  For a few dollars more you could purchase a salon professional product with higher quality ingredients&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line:  Not a bad product, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for those with fine (or thinning) hair.  Contains sulfates and silicone. Not particularly a bargain at the current price of $13.00.</li>
    <li> I found this shampoo to be different than similar products. I have colored hair and have noticed that after a few washings with this shampoo, my hair appears to be more supple, less stiff, and not dull. I shampoo every other day and I find my hair is more attractive now than with the use of other brands. My hair is normally drier than usual, and this shampoo appears to be aimed at dry hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many Pantene products in the past and I&#x27;ve always been very happy with them.  However, this shampoo claims to be an AgeDefy shampoo and I guess I was expecting a miracle.  I&#x27;ve used this product for about a month now and I&#x27;ve seen no noticeable difference in the dryness, split ends, frizz and breakage in my hair, nor has anyone else seen a difference.  I will say that the scent of the shampoo is pleasant, but I&#x27;ve come to expect that from Pantene.  Overall, I think I prefer the cheaper Pantene product for normal hair.  It gives me the same results for less money.</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this product for anyone who has thinning hair.  My hair was at the point where I was beginning to be self conscience about it.  This stuff is fantastic.  I use the shampoo and serum. But I will admit that Amazon&#x27;s price is double the price than the grocery store.  At whatever price, it&#x27;s still worth the money.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t blame the product so I&#x27;m giving the shampoo the average score it currently has, four stars, making my review a wash. Which is kind of ironic.</li>
    <li> I tried samples of this shampoo and the matching conditioner.  They are very nice, and I ordered them for times when I want to just jump in the shower and go fast.  Usually I use Wen, but it takes some time when I use it.  This other shampoo is for those other times occasionally when I&#x27;m short of time &amp; just want to get it done as fast as possible.</li>
    <li> I am in my mid-40&#x27;s and noticed changes in my hair about a year ago.  I have fine hair that is a bit longer than shoulder-length.  Advice says not to wash your hair everyday, but I just have to.  If I don&#x27;t, my hair looks flat and lifeless, and it will just hang on my head like I&#x27;ve done nothing to it.&lt;br /&gt;I had noticed hair loss in the past five years; however, I was noticing that my hair always looked dull, but more than that, it just felt rough and unmanagable.  I kept changing my hairstyle, thinking that would help.&lt;br /&gt;After the first washing with Pantene Age Defy, my hair felt amazing; soft, managable and healthy.  I still wash everyday, and I love the way this product makes my hair look and feel.  I definitely see and feel the difference in the \\&quot;7 signs of aging\\&quot;.  When i use both the shampoo and conditioner (I use the thickening treatment about every other day), the results have been fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;Usually when my hair gets this length, I end up cutting it because of the limp and lifeless look, but I don&#x27;t feel the need to do that while using this product; at least not yet!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the same as with the Hair Mask.  After a few uses my hair becomes full of static and hard to manage. Read my rating and description on that.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo. It puts the shine back in my hair!</li>
    <li> I bought the trio of products offered here in Canada.&lt;br /&gt;I faithfully used them and after two weeks had a huge hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;During one shampoo-conditioner session about 20% of my hair came out. I had I was hoping my hair of average fullness would begin to appear fuller, the exact opposite happened.  I stopped using it immediately.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry Pantene, wish I could give you a glowing recommendation.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo for grey hair.  Prevents that yellow color that happens.</li>
    <li> Have used other Pantene shampoos for years and thought I would try this new one...so far it works great...time will tell.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo and conditioners I have used.  My hair is much silkier, feels in much better condition and yet not weighed down with heavy oils.  I have fine hair  (color treated and several gray hairs) and love this product!</li>
    <li> I have used various Pantene products for years so it wasn&#x27;t hard for me to turn to them for the latest hair emergency in my life.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is perfect in the summer - happy, shiny and bouncy. But the last couple of years it has lost it&#x27;s happiness as soon as summer was over and started to be brittle, dry and static filled. I tried various moisture shampoos with no lasting success, tried conditioning until my hair was lifeless. Nothing helped for more than 1 or 2 treatments.&lt;br /&gt;When I saw the Pantene for aging hair it suddenly struck me that THAT was the problem - my hair was getting older too.&lt;br /&gt;The first couple of times I tried the shampoo I really didn&#x27;t see much change. Then I added the conditioner and still not much but now after using them both for 2 weeks I can tell you that it IS working. I have lots less static in my hair, it looks shiny again and feels moisturized. I don&#x27;t know if it will be a permanent fix but I&#x27;m hoping and happy that Pantene figures out my hair solutions before I do!</li>
    <li> Pantene Pro-V Expert Collection Age Defying Conditioner was specially designed with Olay experts to help fight seven signs of aging hair: 1. Reduces breakage 2. Prevents split ends 3. Reduces frizz  4. Controls unruly grays 5. Minimizes lackluster color  6. Minimizes the look of thinning hair 7. Minimizes dryness. It is gentle enough for daily use on color-treated hair.  Okay, I&#x27;ve been using both products the shampoo and conditioner for over two weeks and I don&#x27;t know about all the above seven claims for fighting the signs of aging hair, but it&#x27;s a great concept and will undoubtedly sell shampoo and conditioner.  I mean, that&#x27;s why I wanted it. I will say that the shampoo bottle is a little hard for me to open.  I have a hard time almost every morning finding the indention to push down on to get the lid to pop open.  I like that it takes very little shampoo to get a good lather and works very well into my hair.  It has a very mild smell and is creamy in texture.  The conditioner bottle is easier to open and also is mild in smell and works equally well into my hair.  What have I noticed about my hair after almost three weeks?  My hair is definitely softer and feels fuller.  It seems to stay better looking longer throughout the day and holds my curl longer.  I do color treat my hair so the fact that it is gentle enough for daily use on color-treated hair was one of the reasons I requested this product.  I can&#x27;t comment on the unruly grays as I color mine.  It does seem to minimize dryness as my hair is not dry and even better, not oily.  I worry about that when using a moisturizing shampoo, but I shampoo my hair every day and have for years.  I have used Pantene products over the years and like them and I like Olay.  So, I would say that these products do most of what they say.  It hasn&#x27;t been rainy so I don&#x27;t know about frizz as that&#x27;s when my hair goes wild.  Overall, I like the products and will continue to buy them.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say that this is any better than Suave.  I saw it in a magazine and wanted to try it.  Wish it did something but honestly I can&#x27;t see any difference and I think my hair has more static when I use it.</li>
    <li> So let me say this shampoo smells really nice, and it washes your hair very well.  I don&#x27;t see much of a difference in this shampoo and other Pantene shampoos. My hair is constantly colored, so I really need a shampoo that is not going to strip out my color, and treat my hair well.  With that being said, I try to only wash my hair twice a week.  I don&#x27;t notice that this shampoo makes a radical difference.  I have used about half of the bottle, and I can&#x27;t say that this does something different.  I wouldn&#x27;t mind trying the conditioner and giving that a try.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is wonderful.  I don&#x27;t even use a conditioner.  I will purchase this product again.  I think most women would like it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product and the serum for about a month. At the beginning I raved about it but now I have developed a dermatitis and it seems it&#x27;s from the drying effect. I don&#x27;t know if it is the serum or the shampoo though because I don&#x27;t use one without the other. The rash is all along my hairline and I will need to discontinue. Bummed because it did show results but you do need to use a conditioner with it.</li>
    <li> I used this product in conjunction with the conditioner and the advanced thickening treatment and I followed the directions exactly.  I purchased these items because of the many glowing reviews at Amazon.  Sadly, the product did not work for me AT ALL.  I have had much more success with Toppik and Folicure lines and can recommend either of them.</li>
    <li> I am a 55 year old woman and have thin hair and falls off when I shampoo my hair. After reading the reviews on Amazon how great this work I tried it. BIG MIstake!!! After using it for one month my hair still falls off in the shower when I shampoo and I still have alot of frizz. My hair still looks the same NO change for the better. So disappointed.</li>
    <li> This product is great- I wish I could find it in stores- I would recommend to all my &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; friends! My hair has never looked better</li>
    <li> My rather dry, shortish, mostly gray hair did respond well to the Pantene Pro-V Expert Collection Agedefy Shampoo (my what a long name), becoming softer and smoother without use of conditioner (which I intentionally left out in out to accurately guage the shampoo).  It truly delivers as well (better?) as high-end salon brands I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this Pantene Pro-V, I noticed very mild scent that I have trouble classifying . . . maybe floral, but not really strongly feminine.  Pleasant enough, but very muted and not a major feature of this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought the lather was relatively thin.  On closer examination, the lather was actually quite creamy with a lot of body, but lacked a lot of the foaminess that I am used to with other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After air drying, I found my hair to be unusually soft and \\&quot;slick\\&quot; to the touch.  Definitely.  Again, this was without the use of a conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with this Pro-V Agedefy and was actually pleasantly surprised, as I generally find that among mainstream shampoos one is about as good as another and I end up with the same old stiff, dry, grayish hair. My hair is still gray (there are other products to address that as desired), but feels pleasingly soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make your own decisions about the price and how much you are willing to spend (this is not by any means cheap), but it is indeed an unusually good shampoo in my experience.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll begin by saying that I&#x27;m old enough to be retired and have color-treated hair, which puts me in the market niche for whom this shampoo was apparently developed. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now and can honestly say I love the stuff. I do use a styling gel with another label but have used it long enough to know that it wasn&#x27;t the gel alone that restored the gloss, shine, and manageability to my hair. I&#x27;m still working and still like to be presentable to my students, which means the Pantene Agedefy shampoo is my new best friend in the shower stall. It is so effective I&#x27;ve even been able to reduce the amount of time I spend with my curling iron! I brush from crown to ear lobe with a nice twist at the cheek and--voila!--there it is: the kind of curl I had \\&quot;back in the day.\\&quot; I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I used this product for two weeks and there was a noticeable improvement with dryness and shine. It worked better when combined with their hair thickening treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I didn&#x27;t think it adressed all the problems that it claims to nor was it any better or worse than the other Pantene products I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another good product from Pantene but not worth the extra hype of a special \\&quot;Agedefy\\&quot; label.</li>
    <li> It made my hair limp and without any body. I would never buy it again! If your hair is fine, don&#x27;t use this product!</li>
    <li> Been using this for quite a while. Love it</li>
    <li> I used this shampoo product along with the The conditioner for several weeks on a 2-3 times a week basis.  My hair did seem to be brighter in color and was shinier, a bit more silky and had more body.</li>
    <li> UPDATE: 11-28-2012&lt;br /&gt;After using daily for a week, I still love this product. HOWEVER, don&#x27;t fall for the Olay/Pantene marriage hype that it will &#x27;fix 7 signs of aging hair&#x27;. While the product does rinse out amazingly well and adds marginal volume, it&#x27;s sulfate based and for me, it is drying. I find I need to deep condition more than normal with it. The label claims it &#x27;fixes&#x27; frizz, dryness and dullness. Dullness seems to be better; hair is shinier. But the frizz/dryness? No way. If you live in a humid climate (it&#x27;s going into winter here in Ohio and very dry) you might be ok without conditioner. For me? It drys me out a bit. Might be fine in the summer. I haven&#x27;t noticed any residue/build-up although it does have silicones in it. Hope this helps you out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thin, fine hair that is always limp and looks oily after a day. I shampoo every day because otherwise, my hair looks like it hasn&#x27;t been washed for a week. I have used Pantene products before with so-so results; nothing amazing. I bought this because I read an article about how this formula not only helped with the signs of aging hair, but also gave great body. Here&#x27;s the thing; I have never used a shampoo without needing at least a very light conditioner (and in the winter, much heavier conditioners) to get the shampoo residue and tangles out of my jaw-length bob. I used this once and I simply could not believe that I could run my hands through my hair after rinsing, still in the shower, without ANY type of conditioner. That&#x27;s a huge deal for me. My hair is very dry, especially now in winter as I color my grays regularly. Fearing fly-aways, I used a tiny amount of conditioner on the ends and then dried/styled. Wow! Body, shine, softness and none of that heavy silicone layer feeling I&#x27;ve felt from some products before. It&#x27;s day 2 now and I have to admit; my hair looks great and I haven&#x27;t washed it again yet! This is my new best friend. Note: Shampoo is yellow/brownish in color, a little thick but easily lathers and rinses out. The scent is nice; not too strong and for a jaw-length bob I only needed about a dime sized dollop. Will update in a week or so to see if buildup is a problem. I still can&#x27;t believe how well it rinsed out!but easily lathers and rinses out. The scent is nice; not too strong and for a jaw-length bob I only needed about a dime sized dollop. Will update in a week or so to see if buildup is a problem. I still can&#x27;t believe how well it rinsed out!</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo.  I originally received a sample of the shampoo in a box of hair color but could not find it in any stores.  I happily found it on Amazon.  I am 62 and have color treated hair that is thinning is spots and brittle in other spots.  This shampoo makes my hair feel and look soft.  My hair also feels much healthier to me since using the shampoo along with Pantene&#x27;s thickening treatment.</li>
    <li> Been using this formula for a few months now and I have to say, I don&#x27;t need anything else to work with.  This is fabulous.  I have hair down to my backside, so with hair that long, you have to really take care of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has not only improved my hair, but it is actually like &amp;#34;new hair&amp;#34; all the way to the ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even the ends are shiny and no spit ends from using this regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I especially love the Age Defy conditioner.  It has worked wonders for me.  My hair, when short is very curly.  Long, it&#x27;s straight.  This formula brought back body and curl to mine.  No frizz and no breakage.  Highly recommend for long hair.</li>
    <li> I have been \\&quot;fighting\\&quot; with my hair for ages now, and as I get older I find that hair products can contribute significantly to this battle. I either get knocked out of the ring right at the first bell, or I manage to keep my hair in control for half a day, or something happens and I end up looking like Don King.&lt;br /&gt;Enough boxing similies.&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s get to the point.&lt;br /&gt;Pantene Pro-V Expert Collection Agedefy Shampoo \\&quot;understands\\&quot; me. It keeps my hair looking silky and younger,&lt;br /&gt;I adore this product! I feel so much prettier!&lt;br /&gt;Feeling pretty and good about yourself should be a part of why you do the things you do when you \\&quot;perform your ablutions\\&quot; (as I like to say when I am kidding around with my husband)!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Pantene, you&#x27;re the champ!</li>
    <li> I have long, thick and wavy salt-and-pepper hair that often looks fly-away and a little frizzy. This shampoo does seem to make a noticeable difference. My hair is softer and easier to manage right after a shampoo, when it&#x27;s usually wildest. I&#x27;m using the same Pantene Ice Shine conditioner I was using with my earlier shampoo (Pantene Ice Shine).</li>
    <li> My hair is thinning so I purchased this product to help with that problem.  It is a very nice shampoo, I hope I get the desired results.</li>
    <li> I received this product via Amazon Vine. I am not a big believer in most advertisement. However, this product really does make my hair feel more luxurious, and more resilient. I color my hair about 2-3x/year, and while I love the color, the process does make the hair feel more brittle. Of note, I have thick black straight hair.  Since I&#x27;ve started using this, I&#x27;ve noticed that the hair has starting to resume some of the original fullness and strength. I am not sure how I can comment on the \\&quot;AgeDefy\\&quot; part since I am probably not of that age demographic and I have been only using this for 2 months. I consider this a very good product, probably one of the most useful things I got to try on Amazon. The only other thing I have noticed that I should bring up is that I seem to need to wash my hair more often, as it seem to make my hair feel more oily sooner. Overall, a solid product.</li>
    <li> First of all, I am NOT getting a discount or freebie for writing this review, I just want to tell you how amazing this stuff really is!! I&#x27;m not THAT old - maybe I feel like I am with 3 kids, but really, I&#x27;m only in my early 30s - but I discovered the Pantene Pro-V Age Defy shampoo (and conditioner!) a few years ago and it really has been a life changer! I have super fine hair, but lots of it, so I went through SO MANY different brands of shampoo/conditioner over the years and just never could find &amp;#34;the one&amp;#34; that made my hair feel beautiful. I think I tried just about every volume-inducing/volume-enhancing/volume-boosting product on the market, and yet, my hair was still dull, dry and lifeless. I tried the Age Defy on a whim (I think I probably had a coupon for that first bottle), and I instantly noticed a HUGE difference! My hair had not felt so soft and looked so shiny since Ross and Rachel had their first kiss (I always wanted Rachel&#x27;s hair!!)! I was also very impressed by the amount of volume that I got (and still get!) with this collection that doesn&#x27;t even advertise how great it is for hair that needs - and begs for! - volume! I seriously have no idea what they put in this stuff, but the &amp;#34;Age Defy&amp;#34; claim is spot on. Even if you&#x27;re not &amp;#34;THAT old,&amp;#34; you might want to give this a shot if your hair is anything less than what it used to be before you found yourself with a mortgage/husband/kids/etc.</li>
    <li> I have not seen any real change to my hair, but I have only used it a couple of times, so I will continue to use it and hopefully I will see improvement.</li>
    <li> In combination with the other Pro-V Expert Collection Agedefy products, it really does make my hair appear thicker.</li>
    <li> This is a great product no matter what your age because it helps to thicken and strengthen hair.  I had almost given up on my frizzy falling out hair until I started using this and the conditioner. Now I get this on the subscription amazon so I never run out.</li>
    <li> The shampoo is below the expectation. Does not keep the promises. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> I chose this product from Amazon Vine because I have always liked and trusted Pantene products, and my hair was driving me crazy! I&#x27;m in my late 40&#x27;s and have very dark brown, almost black hair, and have been getting stray gray hairs for years; my hair has always been very shiny though, so the odd silver gets lost in the black and I haven&#x27;t had to resort to the hassle and expense of coloring my hair - yet. I was beginning to think I would have to, though, because in the last six months or so the texture of my hair has changed, becoming duller, dryer, more flyaway. My stylist rolls his eyes at my Pantene and says I have to use better shampoo, and he has sold me a couple of European shampoos, twice the price of this product, for fine hair and dry hair. They are very nice and help somewhat but don&#x27;t address the texture issue, so I was eager to try this product from good old Pantene - at half the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I&#x27;ve been using it for over a week, daily shampooing, and I can&#x27;t believe the difference in my hair - it feels thicker, the shine is back, no more dry, brittle texture or flyaways - wow! And an added bonus, I really love the smell and texture of the product, thick and golden and pearlescent and smells like cocoa butter, lovely and luxurious - although I must admit, I was so frustrated with the condition of my hair I would&#x27;ve been happy to get these results if it had the texture and smell of peanut butter (although I LOVE peanut butter)... VERY highly recommended to middle-aged people like myself who are facing the inevitable signs of aging hair (coarse texture, dryness, flyaways, unruly grays, etc.), and the label says this product is safe for for daily use on color-treated hair.</li>
    <li> I am 26 years old, thin curly hair. I love trying new thickening or volumizing products and I especially like anything that promises to reduce frizz and increase shine. money is not a problem as I&#x27;m willing to try new products at any price so I decided to give the full system a try and bought the shampoo, conditioner and thickening treatment. I was really hoping for good results but after the first wash, my hair was DULL, DRY, FRIZZY! It did have a thickening effect but not the one you would want. My hair felt coarse and unruly. I gave it another shot and washed again another day but this time blow dried my hair with a round brush hoping it would help with the smoothness instead of letting it air dry.....that was a little bit of an improvement with a little less dullness and frizz. I am on day 3 and hate to say but I will have to return this shampoo and conditioner. Maybe I will try the keratin shampoo instead but I would just wait for a free sample instead of spending money on it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will also keep the thickening treatment and try using it with another shampoo/cond combo and hope that will help.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this shampoo and conditioner my hair looked and felt good, but after the fourth time I used it my hair looked a felt the best it had in years!  I have thick, straight-ish, light brown hair and it makes my hair soft without making it flyaway.  I don&#x27;t color or perm my hair so I don&#x27;t know how well it works on treated hair.  I use it in combination with [[ASIN:B0098JU8T2 Pantene Pro-V Expert Collection Agedefy Conditioner]]. I got this as a free trial, but I&#x27;ve already ordered more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS - It always makes my day to know that people find these reviews helpful. If you&#x27;d also like to ask a question or leave a comment I usually respond the same day, so if you have a question or comment (even if it&#x27;s just to say, Hi!\\&quot;) feel free to post it below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Claire</li>
    <li> First of all this stinks, literally like nauseating overly sweet oil or olay (yuck). It did not make my hair thicker it made it thinner weighted down, flat, sad and worst of all??? It gave me very bad dry scalp/irritation/dandruff I had SCABS on my head I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m allerigic to something in it or the fragence is irrating to the scalp but this is literally a hot mess. I&#x27;m done with pantene, they were great in the early 90&#x27;s but since then nothing of theirs has even come close to their old scents and the body their shampoos USED to give me hair, it&#x27;s a shame.</li>
    <li> I started going grey in my 20&#x27;s so I&#x27;ve had long experience with that type of hair and the shampoos that do and don&#x27;t work with it.  I have thick hair, the kind that frizzes up whenever the air is either very humid or very dry.  I found that this shampoo works well on my hair.  The scent is strong right out of the bottle but doesn&#x27;t remain strong on the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The liquid itself is a golden color, which sort of reminded me of a shiny version of wood glue; I thought it was a strange color choice for grey hair, which can occasionally get a yellowish tinge to begin with.  If you wash your hair everyday, you can get away with one lathering, but if you go more than one day, it requires two applications to get your hair clean.  It does rinse out cleanly, with no residue.  I&#x27;d say that my hair is slightly softer after using it for a couple of weeks, not so wiry and slightly easier to manage.  It played nice with the various after-shampoo hair products I use - no untoward interactions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say that it&#x27;s a good shampoo choice if you have the kind of grey hair that I do. It didn&#x27;t make any dramatic difference with my hair, but it didn&#x27;t dry it out or make it less manageable.  The scent didn&#x27;t annoy me, it lathered nice and rinsed cleanly; it left my hair feeling clean not stripped.  I see that Amazon is listing the price as $19.99 as of the time I&#x27;m writing this; personally, I wouldn&#x27;t pay that much for this shampoo or any shampoo for that matter.</li>
    <li> While I don&#x27;t many of the problems listed on the label that this product is supposed to help, I do fight with unruly grey hair.  My hair is about 70% my natural color and 30% grey, but those awful greys want to stick up and be noticed. After using this shampoo for about a month I can say that I like it.  It lathers well yet rinses clean without leaving any residue behind with a pleasant fragrance.  It leaves my hair soft and manageable without being so overly moisturized that it hangs limp. Do all of the greys stay hidden because of it - no, but they are definitely easier to control.</li>
    <li> Shampoo has been used for the past two weeks, to positive results: very soft, very clean hair. The scalp seems to be less dry, no longer issues with itching and dandruff, the final result after each use is a sense of overall balance and health for the hair. Overall a great product to make your hair feel healthy and look more vibrant.&lt;br /&gt;I do apologize if this sounds like a commercial, but from my personal experience I really feel this is an above average shampoo. 4 Stars.</li>
