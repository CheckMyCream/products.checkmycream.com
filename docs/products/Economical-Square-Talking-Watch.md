      <li>Great.</li>
      <li>Changed band to stretchy one and is really great for the price.</li>
      <li>I think the speaker is great on the front as dad is both viually and hearing impaired.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great buy!1</li>
      <li>/&gt;Should make one with just one proud button to get the time and all the others recessed.</li>
      <li>This talking watch isactually very nice</li>
      <li>Nice watch!</li>
      <li>Speaker volume fair.</li>
      <li>This is a good watch, does what it&#x27;s suppose to.....tell time.</li>
      <li>the hourly chime is good.</li>
      <li>I made a good choice and would do it again.</li>
      <li>I gave this to my toddler who always wants to know what time it is and its PERFECT!!</li>
      <li>Keeps good time and easy to set.  </li>
      <li>but she finds it very easy to hit the button and hear the time.  </li>
      <li>It is very easy for her to set and change.  </li>
      <li>so the fact that its loud and easy for her to hit was best.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad you guys sell them .</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s his favorite thing.</li>
      <li>Well this one works OK.</li>
      <li>so I was nervous as to whether she would be able to hear it.  </li>
      <li>The watch didn&#x27;t even work more than 2 weeks, but while it was working it did what I needed it to do.</li>
      <li>So thank you magic genie who lives in this watch and announces the time, you&#x27;re a lifesaver</li>
      <li>Even in the best circumstances sometimes it&#x27;s not clear and you have to listen 2-3 times to get it.</li>
      <li>wish I could find the original model instead!</li>
      <li>Great watch; my 84 year old dad loves it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not the prettiest watch, but since my wife is allergic to anything containing nickel, I didn&#x27;t want to risk a reaction to the more \\&quot;elegant\\&quot; looking watches that aren&#x27;t exactly made from the most elegant materials.  </li>
      <li>, it is easy to hear and use.</li>
      <li>It is below the button to tell time and is easy to turn on by accident.</li>
      <li>This product does all that it promises, easy to program easy to use, light weight and has been durable for six months.  </li>
      <li>This is fine for the price.  </li>
      <li>This watch is a great help to my recently disable mom.</li>
      <li>I guess that a cheap price meant a cheap product.</li>
      <li>they normally sound louder than this one did</li>
      <li>seems to enjoy it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This is a great watch for visual impaired.</li>
      <li>I bought this watch because of its rating and not its price and was not disappointed.  </li>
      <li>Setting the time is fairly straightforward.  </li>
      <li>I love these watches as a field technician its good to know how much time is going by while I&#x27;m doing time sensitive work.</li>
      <li>Received watch in original packaging with no package damage.  </li>
      <li>is an economical, easy to use watch.&lt;br /&gt;She</li>
      <li>Overall though, it&#x27;s good at telling time and at the end of the day</li>
      <li>I went with this style, because I really don&#x27;t think she would be able to see any size clock</li>
      <li>Great product...more than expected for price!  </li>
      <li>Although this watch was cheap the reviews for it seemed mostly positive</li>
      <li>This watch is far superior to the new watch</li>
      <li>Although it has the positive feature of the speaker on top rather than the bottom as ones finds with many others, the quality of the &#x27;driving&#x27; chip&#x27; determines the overall effectiveness of the watch.</li>
      <li>The purchase price would range as &#x27;great deal for so little&#x27;.</li>
      <li>Nice and simple for him to use.</li>
      <li>Price point is about right</li>
      <li>Since they&#x27;re so affordable, I bouVery ght 3 more for my 88-year-old, very deaf, vision impaired mother&#x27;s hard of hearing friends because they loved the fact that the voice announcing time on my mother&#x27;s watch was clear and easy for them to hear.  </li>
      <li>The watch works great, but sometimes the voice is hard to understand.  </li>
      <li>Keeps her aware of the time by talking .</li>
      <li>The first one died, which raises the question, battery or watch?</li>
      <li>I ordered the first one from the Braille Store and when it quit working in two weeks</li>
      <li>She absolutely loves it!  </li>
      <li>I recommend that anyone needing a talking watch should purchase a bit more expensive brand ($30 to $50) and get one that will be more comfortable to put on,</li>
      <li>but once you get the hang of it the next time is easy</li>
      <li>I would certainly recommend this watch.  </li>
      <li>Arrived quickly, works great, my son is blind</li>
      <li>It can be heard loud and clear, and it is easy to use.</li>
      <li>Just removing the battery and putting back reset the watch and is working fine.</li>
      <li>My father in law loves this watch, it&#x27;s easy for him to use and loud enough for him to hear with out his hearing aids if he puts it right up to his ear.</li>
      <li>haha.  </li>
      <li>she can&#x27;t see very well &amp;</li>
      <li>He has had a  watch like this in past and it worked great for several years</li>
      <li>It is a little large , like most talking watches, which I don&#x27;t like</li>
      <li>I see it is much better quality than any previous ones we bought.</li>
      <li>Simply the loudest and best made talking watch on the planet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t go wrong with this</li>
      <li>The accompanying catalogues that came with the watch (mostly products for the blind) also pleased my father.</li>
      <li>but it turned out to be of high quality.</li>
      <li>great gift for my blind grandson....</li>
      <li>For that price, I had expected to be a cheap watch</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not hard of hearing, and I also cannot understand the speaker giving the time.  </li>
      <li>When a watch wears out, and she has to wait for the new one to come in, she feels lost without it.</li>
      <li>but I had to buy a new battery for it because it wasn&#x27;t working.</li>
      <li>a new battery would not work</li>
      <li>Heading to store to buy new cr2025.  </li>
      <li>so they gave her a new watch just like it for $10</li>
      <li>The voice with a new battery is nice and loud for anyone hard of hearing like my Dad.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really think someone that is hard at hearing would be able to hear the watch girl speak.</li>
      <li>Cheaply made, not worth buying.</li>
      <li>I purchased for my blind father he loves it speaker could be alil better but overall its ok for the money</li>
      <li>This 94 year old WW2 Pearl Harbor Veteran friend that cannot see and has 2 hearing aids but is sharp as a tack wanted to be able to know what the ime was.</li>
      <li>The watch is also a little bit too big for my taste, with most of the space being used by the not so loud speaker.</li>
      <li>Purchased watch for one hundred year old mother who has macular degeneration and depends on watch to tell time.  </li>
      <li>use and hopefully last much longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I bought this watch for my grandmother as her 10 year old talking watch was showing its age.</li>
      <li>I thought maybe they was old.  </li>
      <li>The time voice is no longer as loud or as clear.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;VE PURCHASED IT FOR A  YOUNG GIRL THAT WORKS WITH ME .  </li>
      <li>I wanted an inexpensive one to use while working outside in the yard in case I lost or broke it I wouldn&#x27;t be out too much.</li>
      <li>wanted one with buttons that wouldn&#x27;t be pushed accidentally and it&#x27;s working out som far.</li>
      <li>Make sure you have someone set the watch if the individual has trouble seeing.</li>
      <li>These are good watches for the price-I have bought them for years for my blind husband</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product...more than expected for price!  Will definitely purchase again.   EDIT: my blind aunt had to take the watch in to replace the battery. she was told that the watch has been water damaged and soldered back together. a new battery would not work so they gave her a new watch just like it for $10 they normally sound louder than this one did but we didn&#x27;t give it a second thought. from now on we will order from the catalog for blind customers and pay $11.00 for brand new product. Had I known this was a used watch I would not have ordered it for her</li>
    <li> Got it for my mom who is essentially blind and now she knows what time it is without asking anyone.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Nice watch! Only thing missing is the date and year!</li>
    <li> Did not work out of the box, took the back cover off to properly seat the battery, which got it working.  However while trying to set the time the buttons stopped responding to any input, so the watch is not functioning.  Cheaply made, not worth buying.</li>
    <li> I purchased this watch for a legally blind, elderly friend of mine. The watch is just like the one Radio Shack use to sell. This watch is far superior to the new watch Radio Shack is selling. It can be heard loud and clear, and it is easy to use. I would recommend it for any one with vision problems.</li>
    <li> Bought for my uncle he has Macular Degeneration in both eyes! So he is considered legally blind! This watch works great!</li>
    <li> My Mom is blind and uses this watch and cannot be without it...</li>
    <li> These are good watches for the price-I have bought them for years for my blind husband</li>
    <li> I purchased this watch for my blind father-in-law.  He is very happy with it. Says he won&#x27;t be without one now.</li>
    <li> The talking watch works well, it is easy to hear and use. My only issue is I wish there was a way to disable the buton that turns on the hourly report. It is below the button to tell time and is easy to turn on by accident.</li>
    <li> My father in law loves this watch, it&#x27;s easy for him to use and loud enough for him to hear with out his hearing aids if he puts it right up to his ear.</li>
    <li> Dead on arrival.  Figure the battery is dead so I remove back according to instructions.  Battery is difficult to remove.  Heading to store to buy new cr2025.  We see about review after that!</li>
    <li> I purchased the talking watch for my father who is blind, he loves it. I see it is much better quality than any previous ones we bought. very happy with the product and seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> My brother&#x27;s talking watch failed him so he needed a new one and had ordered one from his normal place,waiting for it few weeks to get delivered .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look online here @ Amazon, got it weeks before his other one came and cheaper (PRIME Rocks) !!  BTW it was the same watch like the one he ordered .</li>
    <li> Bought this for my grandmother who is 94 and has trouble seeing. The screen isn&#x27;t very big but she finds it very easy to hit the button and hear the time.  I went with this style, because I really don&#x27;t think she would be able to see any size clock so the fact that its loud and easy for her to hit was best.  Make sure you have someone set the watch if the individual has trouble seeing.</li>
    <li> My mom can&#x27;t see a regular watch but this one talks to her. Keeps her aware of the time by talking .</li>
    <li> My 90 year old blind brother has dementia and can&#x27;t remember which button to push.</li>
    <li> The product works, but barely. The &#x27;voice&#x27; is tinny and hard to hear, and the buttons are poorly placed and hard to actuate by a 93-year old parent, making the product functionally useless for the purpose intended. I guess you can&#x27;t be too picky given the cheap price, but in this case, you get what you paid for and absolutely no more.</li>
    <li> This product does all that it promises, easy to program easy to use, light weight and has been durable for six months.  My only complaint is the enunciation of the times is not very clear.  If there is any background noise you can&#x27;t understand what it&#x27;s saying.  Even in the best circumstances sometimes it&#x27;s not clear and you have to listen 2-3 times to get it.</li>
    <li> Too many buttons for a senior blind person.&lt;br /&gt;she&#x27;s constantly pressing the wrong button and turning on the alerts or alarms.&lt;br /&gt;Should make one with just one proud button to get the time and all the others recessed.</li>
    <li> I ordered this watch because I needed to replace another watch which was going bad.  The alarm is different and I like that and so do our birds. It&#x27;s easier to program although when I attempted to  operate it for the first time I discovered that the battery was installed in a very tight possition but thanks to a family member I had it functioning in no time. I use this item daily and consider it not to be a waste of time.</li>
    <li> This is a great watch. For that price, I had expected to be a cheap watch but it turned out to be of high quality.</li>
    <li> Unlike the previous models made by the same maker, this one is very difficult to understand the time announcements.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could find the original model instead!</li>
    <li> It was shipped with a dead battery. There is no way to turn it off when not in use so the batteries just run down.&lt;br /&gt;A person with reduced eyesight could not change the battery themselves.</li>
    <li> This watch does just what it is supposed to. It works, and it&#x27;s low cost. My father-in-law is legally blind and loves it.</li>
    <li> A few months ago my wife lost her vision due to a combination of pseudotumor cerebri and sagittal sinus thrombosis putting pressure on her brain and optic nerves.  At this point in time, it&#x27;s hard to say if she&#x27;ll ever get her vision back.  In the meantime, however, we&#x27;ve been buying products that can help her NOW.  After looking at the various watches Amazon has, I decided on this one.  It&#x27;s not the prettiest watch, but since my wife is allergic to anything containing nickel, I didn&#x27;t want to risk a reaction to the more \\&quot;elegant\\&quot; looking watches that aren&#x27;t exactly made from the most elegant materials.  That and there isn&#x27;t a lot of point behind a blind/visually impaired person wearing a large watch face.      This watch has been great for her.  She can now know the time whenever she wants to, rather than having to ask someone or just be in the dark (no pun intended) about what time it is.  It&#x27;s pretty solid, though I doubt it&#x27;ll last forever.    Definitely a recommended purchase.</li>
    <li> If I could give 0 stars I would. I had ordered this for my Grandpa and it arrived defective. Needless to say I was rather disappointed, I am currently looking for another seller.</li>
    <li> I love these watches as a field technician its good to know how much time is going by while I&#x27;m doing time sensitive work. the hourly chime is good. My only problem with the watch is it can&#x27;t take heat or sweat. I blew 2 watches this summer with the watch just being on my wrist while I worked.</li>
    <li> The watch didn&#x27;t even work more than 2 weeks, but while it was working it did what I needed it to do. I hope the manufacturer makes a longer lasting product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this watch for a visually impaired friend in June, 2013.  By the end of July, it was broken and unrepairable.  I guess that a cheap price meant a cheap product.</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 watches.  First one I sent back because after 2 days it didn&#x27;t work,  Received 2nd watch and that didn&#x27;t work either.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I got this for my blind father, who already had a talking watch, but he liked this model better and passed the other down to a Braille member.  I bought this watch because of its rating and not its price and was not disappointed.  The accompanying catalogues that came with the watch (mostly products for the blind) also pleased my father.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my toddler who always wants to know what time it is and its PERFECT!! he can recite the time after hearing it and even looks at the numbers to verify. And, even with his small wrist it still fits, granted with the long excess band hanging off, but I&#x27;m debating trimming it.</li>
    <li> My Mom has low vision and needs a talking watch.&lt;br /&gt;This is an economical, easy to use watch.&lt;br /&gt;She seems to enjoy it.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted one with buttons that wouldn&#x27;t be pushed accidentally and it&#x27;s working out som far.</li>
    <li> The watch was not working properly ,even though i change the battery .that the reason i returned it and requested a refund wil continue to shop with amazon</li>
    <li> My near-blind mother-in-law relies on it. The first one died, which raises the question, battery or watch? I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;ve never seen the watch in person. Does it have a battery? If yes, what&#x27;s the battery life? Is the battery replaceable?</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly, works great, my son is blind so I purchased these watches from other companies before, when I get them they never work there dead! My son gets very upset and disappointed! But this company was 100% satisfaction guaranteed thank you!!!!!</li>
    <li> My friend has been blind since birth.  She has been wearing these watches for years and will only consider wearing this watch.  It is very easy for her to set and change.  When a watch wears out, and she has to wait for the new one to come in, she feels lost without it.</li>
    <li> In addition to being blind, my husband is also hard of hearing.  He cannot understand the speaker. I&#x27;m not hard of hearing, and I also cannot understand the speaker giving the time.  Do not buy this product.</li>
    <li> She doesn&#x27;t like black.  Gave it away.</li>
    <li> Simply the loudest and best made talking watch on the planet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t go wrong with this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No brags, just fact!</li>
    <li> Digital Screen very small.  The sleek black finish makes it hard to read.  Keeps good time and easy to set.  Speaker volume fair.</li>
    <li> The voice was not clear at all.  The watch should have been checked before shipment.  I was not satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> I had been buying RS talking watches for my 90+ father-in-law, who has wet macular degeneration and is compulsive enough that he needs to know the time every 5 minutes. They would last about a year, then fail for one reason or another. These are about half the price but otherwise seem to be functionally the same. It&#x27;s too soon to gauge durability, but the upfront value is tough to beat. At this price I bought him 2 so he has a spare to put into immediate use until I can change the battery on the failed one.</li>
    <li> You can barely hear the person telling the time. Even when you put it up to your ear. Very poorly to give to someone with hearing problems.</li>
    <li> This 94 year old WW2 Pearl Harbor Veteran friend that cannot see and has 2 hearing aids but is sharp as a tack wanted to be able to know what the ime was. Never sure what to go with as very little information regarding how loud any of these watches are, so I took chance. I thought with the speaker out in front should make a difference. Well this one works OK. I would recommend this watch. I call this gentleman and ask what time it is and I can hear it over the phone. I made a good choice and would do it again.</li>
    <li> For less than 20 bucks, you can&#x27;t beat it. Mom has macular degeneration and loves it. A huge help at a small price.</li>
    <li> its just what i asked for</li>
    <li> This is a good watch, does what it&#x27;s suppose to.....tell time. The voice however could bear to be a little louder. I don&#x27;t really think someone that is hard at hearing would be able to hear the watch girl speak. The watch is also a little bit too big for my taste, with most of the space being used by the not so loud speaker. Overall though, it&#x27;s good at telling time and at the end of the day that&#x27;s what a watch is.....a time teller.</li>
    <li> HAVEN&#x27;T TRIED IS YET.  I&#x27;VE PURCHASED IT FOR A  YOUNG GIRL THAT WORKS WITH ME .  SHE HAS DYSLEXIA AND IS UNABLE TO TELL TIME.  HOPE THIS WORKS FOR HER</li>
    <li> My daughter loves her watch she can&#x27;t see very well &amp; this helps her thank you</li>
    <li> Bought for 92 year old blind father.  Nice and simple for him to use.</li>
    <li> this was purchased for an elderly blind person..item stopped working within a week. tried a new battery and still didn&#x27;t work.very disappointed</li>
    <li> I obtained the watches (one for backup) for a blind cousin and they are everything that I had hoped they would be for the price.  The voice is clear enough to be understood.  Setting the time is fairly straightforward.  The only hassle involves the 6 tiny screws that one must deal with in order to change the battery.</li>
    <li> My mother is blind and could never set this watch herself.  Even her neighbor could not figure it out.  I finally set it but the alarm keeps getting set accidentally because the buttons to set are small and my mother keeps pushing the wrong one. Since she can&#x27;t see she has to feel for the buttons.  The idea is right but someone didn&#x27;t think about how a blind person would set the watch themselves.</li>
    <li> My blind father loves these things. He hits the buttons constantly and is 92 so he eventually beats the heck out of the product. Even with constant abuse and spilled drinks and morning showers they still hold up on average about three months before the buttons go hinky. At the price I buy them 4 at a time. The voice with a new battery is nice and loud for anyone hard of hearing like my Dad. It&#x27;s his favorite thing.</li>
    <li> Great watch; my 84 year old dad loves it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this watch for my 84 year old mother who recently went totally blind.  She absolutely loves it!  She is also extremely hard of hearing so I was nervous as to whether she would be able to hear it.  She can and it is a great help to her. Before she would constantly be asking what time it was.  This watch has given her a sense of independence again.  I would certainly recommend this watch.  It&#x27;s a great buy!1</li>
    <li> My mom is losing her vision and loves this watch which can tell her the time. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Although this watch was cheap the reviews for it seemed mostly positive so I ordered one for a visually impaired relative. Big mistake for several reasons. The watch arrived with one button missing, just the tiny stub left underneath. The buttons were too small, hard to set and easy to push the wrong one. It took several minutes each morning to buckle it on. After about two weeks it died completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although Amazon does have a good return policy it is never easy for the visually impaired to locate phone numbers and emails on this site, and not easy to manage mailing labels and getting packages to UPS. I recommend that anyone needing a talking watch should purchase a bit more expensive brand ($30 to $50) and get one that will be more comfortable to put on, use and hopefully last much longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This watch was the wrong choice.</li>
    <li> The watch works great, but sometimes the voice is hard to understand.  My husband is blind and really depends on the voice of the watch. He has had a  watch like this in past and it worked great for several years</li>
    <li> This watch is a great help to my recently disable mom. Now she can know the time. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I am blind and have had several talking watches. I wanted an inexpensive one to use while working outside in the yard in case I lost or broke it I wouldn&#x27;t be out too much. This talking watch isactually very nice, it has a clear loud enough voice and is not too difficult to set. It is a little large , like most talking watches, which I don&#x27;t like so I keep it in my pocket but, it tells me what time it is so... The only really negative is the fact that it has a very strong plastic or chemical smell, which I hope will lessen over time. If you can&#x27;t see  a watch and want something  not too expensive, this is the watch for you.</li>
    <li> There was either no battery in the watch when I received it or the battery was dead. I found another watch that had a big green button on the front, which was much easier for my husband to feel/see, so that he didn&#x27;t have to worry about trying to fiddle with the very tiny buttons on the side. This is not a watch for people with seeing issues.</li>
    <li> i like it but I had to buy a new battery for it because it wasn&#x27;t working. if I knew I was buying a watch that didn&#x27;t run I would have got it from somewhere else.</li>
    <li> Purchased watch for one hundred year old mother who has macular degeneration and depends on watch to tell time.  The watch stopped working after six weeks.  Called Lily&amp;#34; Home and I was advised I would receive credit on Amazon account.  Waiting for e-mail confirmation from Amazon.  Ordered replacement watch from another company.</li>
    <li> Since they&#x27;re so affordable, I bouVery ght 3 more for my 88-year-old, very deaf, vision impaired mother&#x27;s hard of hearing friends because they loved the fact that the voice announcing time on my mother&#x27;s watch was clear and easy for them to hear.  Unfortunately, they&#x27;ve made a minor change.  The time voice is no longer as loud or as clear.  The battery is hard to change, but Radio Shack will do it for customers at no charge.  The replacement battery there costs around $7.00.</li>
    <li> Got the watch for my father for Father&#x27;s Day,when package arrived took watch out to set and it wouldn&#x27;t work. I had to go and purchase a battery for it. Don&#x27;t feel I should&#x27;ve had to do that.</li>
    <li> The purchase price would range as &#x27;great deal for so little&#x27;. Although it has the positive feature of the speaker on top rather than the bottom as ones finds with many others, the quality of the &#x27;driving&#x27; chip&#x27; determines the overall effectiveness of the watch. Even after replacing the battery with a new one, numbers such as 6 and 8 were often garbled and requires several attempts for it to be clear. This is extremely frustrating for a completely blind watch wearer.</li>
    <li> Picked this up for my uncle who&#x27;s legally blind in both eyes.  He is also a diabetic and needs to know the time so he knows when he has to eat, snack or get a shot.  Think he was driving the family a little crazy from asking the time every 20 minutes haha.  So thank you magic genie who lives in this watch and announces the time, you&#x27;re a lifesaver</li>
    <li> great gift for my blind grandson....he loves it.</li>
    <li> This is fine for the price.  I think the speaker is great on the front as dad is both viually and hearing impaired.  I did need to put in a battery for it to work.  Lost 2 of those tiny screws on back in the process of changing battery.  Changed band to stretchy one and is really great for the price.</li>
    <li> anyone who has trouble with their vision the watch was a little hard to set but once you get the hang of it the next time is easy</li>
    <li> Great. My grandmother is blind. She uses this all the time . Her previous watch stopped working she felt so lost without her talking watch. I&#x27;m glad you guys sell them .</li>
    <li> I ordered the first one from the Braille Store and when it quit working in two weeks I thought maybe they was old.  But ordered this last one from Amazon and it also quit in a week.  I don&#x27;t think I will order another one from anyone</li>
    <li> I purchased for my blind father he loves it speaker could be alil better but overall its ok for the money</li>
    <li> could not set time all buttons are black small and close together got the watch for someone who can barely see and it didnt work right out of the box</li>
    <li> Received watch in original packaging with no package damage.  Noticed it not running.  I read directions and attempted setting time... It appeared the battery was out.  Simce I&#x27;m visually impaired, I chose to get a new battery locally. Same results.  A non-working watch.</li>
    <li> I bought this watch for my grandmother as her 10 year old talking watch was showing its age. It only worked for an hour. Seller says no return. Poor product and service. This is the only one star rating I have ever placed on amazon after countless purchases.</li>
    <li> I order this watch for my mother in law who has impaired vision, and although it only lasts about 6 months, I keep buying it because it is cheap.&lt;br /&gt;However the one I just received is not working at all, and it is disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;I am going to have to return it and will try to find a watch that can last longer.</li>
    <li> Did not work from the start.  No instructions were provided. Price point is about right If it only had worked</li>
    <li> It can be a pain sometimes.</li>
    <li> This is a great watch for visual impaired. I received it dead on arrival. Just removing the battery and putting back reset the watch and is working fine. I wonder if MicroSoft was involved?</li>
    <li> It was difficult to set because the buttons are so small and needed a new  battery after we received it.it was fine but has now stopped working. Can&#x27;t get the back off(someone else helped us with it before) and don&#x27;t know where to go to get it serviced.</li>
    <li> We could not get this watch to run much less keep time.  A talking watch is for sight impared people and the handicapped.  The person who was to get the watch was blind.  I tried to get the watch set and carefully followed the instructions but it would never activate and keep time.  There was no information to get in touch with the seller that we could find to discuss a return so we just purchased a watch that does not keep time.  This was a waste of time and money.</li>
