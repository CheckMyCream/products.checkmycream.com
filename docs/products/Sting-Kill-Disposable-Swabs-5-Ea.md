    <li> This stuff will stop the sting of any bite or sting from anything instantly. Great if you have kids</li>
    <li> This stuff really works!  It&#x27;s amazing.  We were riding horses in Shawnee and knew there were bee issues.  Sure enough I got nailed by something more than a bee.  It immediately helps the sting.  I had to keep putting it on but it did help a lot!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with product, works very well on mosquito bites especially. I live in a semi rural area so there are always things that sting and bite near by, this has been a great help. Shipping was faster than most, great service all round.</li>
    <li> I am a beekeeper and I use this any time I get stung!!  Great product!!!</li>
    <li> These things are awesome. I have some that are expired in the 1980 that I keep in my car emergency kit that still work. So glad the same company is still around.</li>
    <li> Works great with wasp bites around here.</li>
    <li> Bought these because I have a bee hive and wanted to make sure I had something on hand....just in case.</li>
    <li> Seemed like a great deal for these, for next time I go camping and come back with mean bug bites that&lt;br /&gt;sometimes sting or itch like crazy.  I&#x27;ll be looking forward to sharing these with friends too.</li>
    <li> This makes the bee sting mark go down within minutes and takes the itch away! It worked great on my kids and myself!</li>
    <li> Seems like a good product but it&#x27;s hard to review without being stung. I hope I never need to write a review but I&#x27;m glad I have these just in case.</li>
    <li> Remarkable stuff.  The grandkids were playing too close to a hornets nest.  They were chased off and received multiple stings.  These swabs made the pain go away instantly!  I&#x27;m not kidding, it was instantaneous!  Well worth the money.  Now in my car, my medicine cabinet, and my first aid kit.</li>
    <li> Doing pest control, I occasionally get stung (usually when I don&#x27;t know there&#x27;s a nest).  I stay swollen for weeks where I get stung.  This is the only product that prevented me from swelling up.  I&#x27;ve only used it once though.</li>
    <li> These things work great for bee and wasp stings.</li>
    <li> Already had to use 3!</li>
    <li> Caught my finger in The Club® brake lock on our truck. No broken skin but it hurt. Grabbed a Sting-Kill from the wall of the garage (the red and yellow package makes it stand out), rubbed it on and bandaged it in case I bumped it while working. Blood blisters usually hurt more and more; this worked so good I forgot about it.</li>
    <li> Dreadfully allergic to bee stings. Carry this with me where ever I go.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work go out and get the itch stick or whatever it is called it works much better than this stuff and it is hard to use.</li>
    <li> These Sting Kill are the best for treating bee and wasp stings. I recommend them to everyone.</li>
    <li> Sting-Kill will instantly neutralize any insect sting or bite.  I have used this product for over 45 years.  Anyone allergic to stings needs to keep it close at all times.</li>
    <li> Good to have when camping. Easy to use and disposable. Nice additional to a First Aid kit.</li>
    <li> Takes the sting right out!!!!</li>
    <li> Help take the pain out of bee stings. An old fashioned remedy but seems to work.</li>
    <li> A must; my grandson stepped on a bee the other day; this calmed him right down. I gave a pack to each of my daughters to keep in their glove box and first aid kit.</li>
    <li> This is aboslutely the best ever bee sting swab I have ever used. it works on spider bites too love it</li>
    <li> Superior product.  enjoyed this very much.</li>
    <li> I have used these for years. ran over a nest of yellow jackets on the tractor while bush hogging.  Got stung 12+ times. nasty things, but the swabs treated 2 to 3 stings each, took the pain out and the swelling stopped.  I went back to the nest on foot with my propane brush torch... crispie critters!</li>
    <li> These are the best for insect bites that itch. Have used them for years.</li>
    <li> I grew up with sting kill.  My father owned a company who built power lines.  They always had sting kill on every truck in their first aid kits.  He brought some home for us to use.  Now I use it with my son.  When a just stung autistic 3 year old will calm within 30 seconds of application, you know it works!</li>
    <li> This product works really well if you use it right away when you get stung. Really minimizes the swelling &amp; pain. I keep a pack in my car &amp; home. It has saved the day many times most recently when a friend was stung by wasp.</li>
    <li> I have not had to use any of these yet but have in the past and they work to relieve the pain of a wasp or bee sting.</li>
    <li> I used a swab recently after a bee sting.  It immediately eliminated the pain and I was very pleased.  It did not reduce the swelling.  I was relieved to have the pain gone, so thought this was a great buy.</li>
    <li> Great if your allgeric to bee stings</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a bee keeper...enough said 😄</li>
    <li> These are hard to find and really work...they were just as I expected and got to my door in a flash...Thanks!</li>
    <li> I was so glad to find this, hard to find, item.  I have used this for years and like to keep several on hand for bee stings.  Handy to use and invaluable when someone experiences a &amp;#34;sting&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I needed one right away when I stepped on a bee at a concert.  It took the pain away quickly.  Great product.</li>
    <li> We have scorpions where we live and I have a 2 year old granddaughter.  I have to have these just in case.  They also work great when she steps in a fire ant pile!  They work very quickly.  Don&#x27;t know why you can&#x27;t buy them in a store.</li>
    <li> I like to have these on hand for stings.  Good to keep in small first aid packs just in case.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works.</li>
