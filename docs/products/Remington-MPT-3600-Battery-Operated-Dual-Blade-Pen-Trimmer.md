### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Called Remington customer service - excellent assistance.  </li>
      <li>My hubby is very happy.</li>
      <li>I have been using Remington detail trimmers for sometime now and find they are excellent.</li>
      <li>The best tool for the job.</li>
      <li>It has always worked wonderful.</li>
      <li>works great</li>
      <li>always a great item except for battery issues</li>
      <li>No ON indicator on mine, and a battery compartment that didn&#x27;t make contact with the battery, makes an otherwise great product suffer.</li>
      <li>After a year with the product, it still works great</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>but it does a great job</li>
      <li>No ON indicator on mine, and a battery compartment that didn&#x27;t make contact with the battery, makes an otherwise great product suffer.</li>
      <li>The best way so solve the issue is to remove the battery when storing for a week or more, then return it just during use each time.</li>

      <li>Battery is good - unit just stopped working.  </li>
      <li>Good luck.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Even so, the product trims ear and nose hair so good, and I&#x27;m guessing 90 percent of these probably work out of the box without modification</li>

      <li>Very pleased with this trimmer.</li>
      <li>I have had the predecessor to this one for 20 yrs., and always liked it</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure the trimmer will bring plenty of good use.</li>
      <li>Nice electric shaver.</li>
      <li>Very handy to have available for touch-ups around the ears, nose and eyebrows as needed.</li>
      <li>Great Trimmer, keep your nose clean and your ears too.</li>
      <li>Also, a good quality battery like a Duracell alkaline or even better a lithium will be better.</li>
      <li>Also, a good quality battery like a Duracell alkaline or even better a lithium will be better.</li>
      <li>Very easily, they will get minute amounts of hair or oil accumulated in the blade areas.</li>
      <li>I plan to brush, then oil the blades, which comes off very easily, after each use, for longer life.</li>
      <li>One of the issues I have had with pen trimmers is that they do not seem to have very strong motors.</li>
      <li>first 2-3 months were great</li>
      <li>Glad I bought another from Wahl as a backup</li>
      <li>If you examine the design and positioning of the blades on this trimmer you will be able to see why these are a better trimmer choice.</li>
      <li>At first he loved it and was very satisfied with the close and painless trimming and that it was light.  </li>
      <li>of this writing (4-20-14), I am completely satisfied with this Remington MPT-3600 Dual Blade Pen Trimmer.</li>
      <li>Overall, still the best trimmer for your nose or ears</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sure if I&#x27;d pursued it, Amazon would have replaced them, but I didn&#x27;t keep the packaging in either case and just couldn&#x27;t follow up on it.  </li>
      <li>Trimmer has quite working with no return now available!</li>
      <li>Overall, still the best trimmer for your nose or ears</li>
      <li>I am satisfied with it and would recommend it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Just be sure that you keep fresh batteries in it, or it won&#x27;t be as effective.</li>
      <li>Handy for those hard to reach nose hairs and great for keeping your eyebrows in good shape.</li>
      <li>So far this unit is working great.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Motor has better power than the cheap 5 dollar one my girlfriend bought</li>
      <li>The accumulation is easily cleaned by disassembling the blade, however.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s Ok, nothing special...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d like to see reviewers be &amp;#34;honest&amp;#34; and share up front whether their hair is course or fine.</li>
      <li>viola, the unit worked fine.</li>
      <li>Worked fine for four weeks  - stopped working.  </li>
      <li>I had a cheap unit that just didn&#x27;t have any power.  </li>
      <li>Worked okay for a bit, then motor stopped running even with fresh batteries after a couple months.  </li>
      <li>This product is worth buying for sure, and for your friends too.</li>
      <li>This feels so cheap though</li>
      <li>far as how the unit works, for trimming nose and ear hair, this is by far the best product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>Very useful for nose and ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If this had a charger to drop into after each use, so you had a full charge every time you used it, it would be fine.  </li>
      <li>Kind of cheap and only works ok.</li>
      <li>The motor on this unit seems fairly strong compared to an older pen trimmer that I have used for many years.</li>
      <li>This tapping method was good for the next two times.  </li>
      <li>The blades extend outward and are positioned perfectly to cut better than other similar trimmers.</li>
      <li>First, I have fairly fine hair.</li>
      <li>but it stops running quite quickly.  </li>
      <li>This price seemed worthy of a try.</li>
      <li>It is OK for your eye brows and pretty much nothing else.</li>
      <li>It does have trouble getting through thicker patches of hair, but its great for quick trims around the eyebrows or neck line.</li>
      <li>would mostly just use this if I wanted to shave off the hair completely, like the peach fuzz on the rest of my face.</li>
      <li>I like nice and short eyebrows</li>
      <li>Totally worth the money.</li>
      <li>Taking it back to get my money refunded, and will gladly pay  a lot more for a decent product.</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly, and is exactly as described.</li>
      <li>This actually clips all the hairs it contacts with and is very quick, easy and painless.</li>
      <li>Only time will tell if the battery life is good, but as I don&#x27;t think I will use the thing more than once per week, I have a feeling it&#x27;ll last at least 6 months to a year before I have to worry about replacing the battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After a year with the product, it still works great</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t be fooled with the other products out there in every store, they are not near as good as this product!!!</li>
      <li>This thing is great but that second blade on the back just gets in the way.  </li>
      <li>Great product for everyday use and reasonably priced...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve purchased many top brand ear/nose hair trimmers with the round end on them and they all blow.</li>
      <li>I only use it to trim my mustache and eyebrows, use it very lightly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure most would return it for another product if the unit didn&#x27;t turn on at all, but I think I may have actually improved the unit by bending that pin to make really solid contact with the battery.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve ever used (used a lot of them), just have to work around the battery issue, and possibly bending the clips to make better contact on each side of the battery.it</li>
      <li>The first one worked for awhile, then died.  </li>
      <li>to make sure I didn&#x27;t receive a different unit from what was ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I swallowed my pride and bought this one which trims just as well as the first one.</li>
      <li>broke after the first use.</li>
      <li>Pretty rubbish.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve ever used (used a lot of them), just have to work around the battery issue, and possibly bending the clips to make better contact on each side of the battery.</li>
      <li>and I love the extra tilt ability of the shaver head.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure most would return it for another product if the unit didn&#x27;t turn on at all, but I think I may have actually improved the unit by bending that pin to make really solid contact with the battery.</li>
      <li>Finally, I figured the contact must not be touching the battery, and sure enough</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is much better, and about the same price.</li>
      <li>I bought this trimmer at a local store for about one dollar more than listed here.  </li>
      <li>Make sure that you put a drop of oil on the blades every &amp;#34;once in a while&amp;#34; to keep it running smoothly or when it slows down.</li>
      <li>so it made contact with the positive contact of the battery, and</li>
      <li>I bought a more hefty, and more expensive, Norelco trimmer that was infinitely better made but did not trim as well as the old Remington.  </li>
      <li>These little trimmers are so handy and convenient.</li>
      <li>normally when a shaver my beard,i would first use the andis to lineup my beard, than use a women eyebrow straight razor (Kai Eye Brow )with shaver gel...</li>
      <li>Drains batteries fast but works well</li>
      <li>have to bump the head to make it work fast.</li>
      <li>Thinking it was a fluke, I bought another one, and it wouldn&#x27;t work from the very beginning.  </li>
      <li>I bought a few of the others that were more expensive and this thing is just perfect.</li>
      <li>Individuals with really course hair may find pen trimmers ineffective.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Battery last a long time and it gets all those annoying little hard to reach hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All hairs be gone</li>
    <li> This trimmer would not turn on with the stock battery. I replaced it with a new Duracell and it still did nothing. I spent 15 minutes trying to figure out how to turn it on. Instructions on Remington site say there is a ON indicator above the Remington logo. Not so, on mine. In fact, there was no ON indicator anywhere. A couple other customer comments on Remington&#x27;s site asked where the on off switch was and &#x27;how do you turn this thing on&#x27;. A product picture on Remington product picture clearly shows an ON indicator/label above the slide I was trying, but on mine, it was missing. Finally, I figured the contact must not be touching the battery, and sure enough, that is what it was. Using a small pointed knife I bent the metal pin on the bottom of the battery compartment so it made contact with the positive contact of the battery, and viola, the unit worked fine. I think many negative comments about how short the battery life, may in fact be due to poor contact to the positive battery post. After a couple minutes carefully bending this metal pin up towards the battery may resolve the battery life issue. Not sure, though, as I have only had the unit one day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as how the unit works, for trimming nose and ear hair, this is by far the best product I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve purchased many top brand ear/nose hair trimmers with the round end on them and they all blow. This actually clips all the hairs it contacts with and is very quick, easy and painless. I did not use the attachment, just the long clipper side &#x27;rolled&#x27; on the inside wall of the ear and nose a couple times and in 15-30 seconds, I didn&#x27;t see a hair anywhere. I plan to brush, then oil the blades, which comes off very easily, after each use, for longer life. For a $10 product, I think this is a 10 out of 10 for trimming ear and nose hair on a male my size or larger. The trimmer barely fits inside the ear canal and I&#x27;m 5&#x27; 11&amp;#34;&amp;#34; so it may be too uncomfortable for someone with a smaller frame. I only gave it four starts out of five because the manufacturing quality control and design seems very poor. No ON indicator on mine, and a battery compartment that didn&#x27;t make contact with the battery, makes an otherwise great product suffer. Even so, the product trims ear and nose hair so good, and I&#x27;m guessing 90 percent of these probably work out of the box without modification, it&#x27;s still a solid four stars. I&#x27;m sure most would return it for another product if the unit didn&#x27;t turn on at all, but I think I may have actually improved the unit by bending that pin to make really solid contact with the battery. Only time will tell if the battery life is good, but as I don&#x27;t think I will use the thing more than once per week, I have a feeling it&#x27;ll last at least 6 months to a year before I have to worry about replacing the battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After a year with the product, it still works great BUT the battery life actually is not as great as I hoped. It lasts a month or so then gets weak or dies. The best way so solve the issue is to remove the battery when storing for a week or more, then return it just during use each time. Also, a good quality battery like a Duracell alkaline or even better a lithium will be better. Another option, the one I use, is if you happen to have rechargeable batteries and a charger, to use rechargeables. I have one battery charged in reserve at all times, then have to worry about nothing.

    <li> These little trimmers are so handy and convenient. I wish they were made a little sturdier because I seem to have to replace mine every year but for the price it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> this product gets the job done when it works... but it stops running quite quickly.  I have purchased 3 of these in the past and they all broke (stopped running)... i will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used now for a month, and the jury is still out...  It&#x27; works but it might have a tendency to pull/cut sensitive areas...</li>
    <li> This thing is great but that second blade on the back just gets in the way.  I have smallish nostrils and that second blade makes it difficult to get the shaver in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Motor has better power than the cheap 5 dollar one my girlfriend bought (and I killed), but it is a bit too weak to trim my sideburns.</li>
    <li> Bought 3 and only one works and then only if you twist the case you really do get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this little shaver to strim facial hair, side-burns, even nose hairs!&lt;br /&gt;This is second one!  Thank you for carrying this product.  My hubby is very happy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for years.  I&#x27;ve bought others and they don&#x27;t even come close to the precision this one has.  Make sure that you put a drop of oil on the blades every &amp;#34;once in a while&amp;#34; to keep it running smoothly or when it slows down.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for one I had that quit working, even with a new battery.  This feels so cheap though, it is likely it will need to be replaced eventually as well.</li>
    <li> I finally got tired of slapping it, banging it against the counter, and rearranging the case and junked my old Remington trimmer.  I bought a more hefty, and more expensive, Norelco trimmer that was infinitely better made but did not trim as well as the old Remington.  I swallowed my pride and bought this one which trims just as well as the first one. If you&#x27;re not hung up on quality, workmanship, etc. this trimmer is for you.</li>
    <li> Great Trimmer, keep your nose clean and your ears too.</li>
    <li> Easily bogged down, burns up batteries and motor died after 3 months. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this junk, not worth it.</li>
    <li> Worked fine for four weeks  - stopped working.  Battery is good - unit just stopped working.  Amazon indicates refund/replacement period has lapsed.  Very disappointed as Amazon has been great for many purchases.  Update:  Called Remington customer service - excellent assistance.  Sending a replacement unit to me.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly, and is exactly as described. Work VG. I have had the predecessor to this one for 20 yrs., and always liked it, it finally just ran out of life. Update: 9/20/15 Trimmer has quite working with no return now available!</li>
    <li> Worked okay for a bit, then motor stopped running even with fresh batteries after a couple months.  Not worth it.</li>
    <li> always a great item except for battery issues</li>
    <li> The battery seems to run down almost immediately on this trimmer.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to have the power to get itself going.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Bought this at my local CVS Pharmacy for about $10 after using a coupon.  I bought it to trim&lt;br /&gt;my eyebrows primarily as my old one had broke.  I used the short settings first on the comb and it&lt;br /&gt;totally shave my eyebrow off !!  Be careful not to use the short setting on your eyebrows as it&lt;br /&gt;will completely shave it off.  I like nice and short eyebrows but this made me look like a Chemo patient !&lt;br /&gt;I got a ton of hell in the office from my buddies !  Other than that, it seems like it&#x27;ll do its job.</li>
    <li> Totally worth the money. So much better than the other contenders!</li>
    <li> First, I have fairly fine hair. Individuals with really course hair may find pen trimmers ineffective. I&#x27;d like to see reviewers be &amp;#34;honest&amp;#34; and share up front whether their hair is course or fine. Some folks have hair like barbed wire then write a negative review of the product. Pen trimmers have tiny motors running on 1.5 volts DC, folks!! It&#x27;s not the fault of the pen trimmer if YOU have barbed wire hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this trimmer pen arrived, it has been operating up to &amp;#34;my&amp;#34; expectations. The motor on this unit seems fairly strong compared to an older pen trimmer that I have used for many years. My older unit finally quit. One of the issues I have had with pen trimmers is that they do not seem to have very strong motors. Very easily, they will get minute amounts of hair or oil accumulated in the blade areas. The accumulation is easily cleaned by disassembling the blade, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Remington MPT-3600 Pen Trimmer seems to have a much stronger &amp;#34;sounding&amp;#34; motor. This perception may be due to the fact my old pen trimmer (I forget its brand as I threw it away, but it was not a Remington) was significantly less powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the tilting head, I find no particular advantage in this feature. I do not have a beard or moustache so this feature may very well be conducive these folks. The tilting head does not seem to be detrimental to the speed at which the trimmer motor runs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read other reviews regarding a slow down of the motor or poor trimming performance. I&#x27;ve noticed with my operation of this model of Remington pen trimmer, that if the blade assembly  is not fully engaged and latched, it will not trim for beans. A couple of times, I hastily reassembled the head after cleaning, I did not insure the blade assembly was fully engaged and latched. I wouldn&#x27;t trim for squat!! So, carefully insure blade assemble is properly engaged and latched after cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As of this writing (4-20-14), I am completely satisfied with this Remington MPT-3600 Dual Blade Pen Trimmer. I will update this review if and when it necessary due to defect or disappointment. Otherwise, consider it working to &amp;#34;my&amp;#34; expectations and satisfaction.</li>
    <li> Very, very rough on skin. I don&#x27;t recommend buying this product.</li>
    <li> I have bought this product numerous times. It has always worked wonderful. But this time I was incredibly disappointed. It cut my skin and painfully ripped the hairs out instead of shaving them like they are supposed to.</li>
    <li> first 2-3 months were great but after that it become awkwardly slow and doesn&#x27;t work that well. did try changing the batteries but still is the same. have to bump the head to make it work fast.</li>
    <li> THis product shavers closer than my Andis t-line....and I paid abt 9$ for it and paid 50$ for my Andis.....normally when a shaver my beard,i would first use the andis to lineup my beard, than use a women eyebrow straight razor (Kai Eye Brow )with shaver gel...&lt;br /&gt;to give the sharper edge, NOW, no more gel and eyebrow razor, I use this product for trimming around the ear and between the nose and lip and around my gold-t..but come on this product isnt mint to shaver you whole head...but it does a great job</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Ok, nothing special...</li>
    <li> Works as expected. Arrived with a dead battery.</li>
    <li> I have had one in the past and it lasted for years---the new one is even better, cuts better and is sooo quiet. This product is worth buying for sure, and for your friends too. I trim my fuzz on my face, hair on my arms, nose hairs, neck hairs, around my eye brows, just anywhere you don&#x27;t want hair. Don&#x27;t be fooled with the other products out there in every store, they are not near as good as this product!!!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this trimmer. It works well and I love the extra tilt ability of the shaver head. This is a nicer than usual pen trimmer.</li>
    <li> Handy for those hard to reach nose hairs and great for keeping your eyebrows in good shape.</li>
    <li> Works very quietly and fast</li>
    <li> I was purchasing these at a local brick and mortar until they were no longer available.  The most recent set I ahve purchased have broken very quickly after just a week of using them.  I am disappointed.</li>
    <li> This thing has some serious horsepower and RPMs. Mows down hair like a lumberjack on crack let loose in an enchanted forest.</li>
    <li> I agree with all the other 1 start posts. This starts of well and dies shortly thereafter. Pretty rubbish.</li>
    <li> Bough for my husband’s nose hairs at the end of June.  He uses the clippers about every two weeks.  At first he loved it and was very satisfied with the close and painless trimming and that it was light.  The third time he went to use it, two weeks later, it stopped working.  He put a new battery in and it still didn&#x27;t work.  We read the reviews and used one of the suggestions and he tapped it against a hard surface and it worked again. This tapping method was good for the next two times.  Last week he tapped for quite a while and put in yet another fresh battery.  Dead as a door nail.  Of course now it’s too late to return it.  We had bought this same clipper a couple of years ago and it lasted about  nine months before it died.  The price is still cheap but it’s now an even bigger waste of money.</li>
    <li> It works well, but the attachment was disappointing. I use this trimmer to shorten my bushy brow hair. The &amp;#34;long&amp;#34; side doesn&#x27;t get them short enough, but the &amp;#34;short&amp;#34; side shave my brow completely off!!&lt;br /&gt;I would mostly just use this if I wanted to shave off the hair completely, like the peach fuzz on the rest of my face. It&#x27;s not good for trimming eyebrows with the attachment it comes with.</li>
    <li> Great product for everyday use and reasonably priced...</li>
    <li> works great no complaints</li>
    <li> Not a great product, get Wahl 5640-600 Micro Groomsman Personal Trimmer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is much better, and about the same price.</li>
    <li> It is OK for your eye brows and pretty much nothing else. Blades are not good, pulling hair, does not cut fine hair. You get what you paid for.</li>
    <li> It does have trouble getting through thicker patches of hair, but its great for quick trims around the eyebrows or neck line. It did pull some hairs without cutting them, but for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> I just received my MPT-3600 and the unit uses a single AAA (that&#x27;s 3-A&#x27;s, not 4) battery. The listing is wrong. I double checked the model number, etc. to make sure I didn&#x27;t receive a different unit from what was ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if - like me - you often order batteries along with the product that requires them, do not make the same mistake I did. I have NOTHING in my house that uses AAAA batteries. Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product DOES come with one AAA battery in the box. I&#x27;m sure the trimmer will bring plenty of good use. Trimmers like this range in price upwards to $50+. This price seemed worthy of a try.</li>
    <li> It never worked. Piece of junk.</li>
    <li> Came defective out of the package. True disappointment as Remington has been a pretty reliable product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to find a pen trimmer that worked as well as my other one for a cheap price.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these, and I regret both purchases.  The first one worked for awhile, then died.  Thinking it was a fluke, I bought another one, and it wouldn&#x27;t work from the very beginning.  Very disappointing, and I definitely don&#x27;t recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure if I&#x27;d pursued it, Amazon would have replaced them, but I didn&#x27;t keep the packaging in either case and just couldn&#x27;t follow up on it.  But I have to emphasize that these were poorly made and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them at all.</li>
    <li> Nice electric shaver. No pinches, no cuts; no complaints.</li>
    <li> So far this unit is working great.  I had a cheap unit that just didn&#x27;t have any power.  This Remington has 2 blades, small and normal size, push on trimmer for short or long length.  You can adjust the angle, but I keep it set and haven&#x27;t moved it.  Has a cap to protect the end when you put it in away.</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer at a local store for about one dollar more than listed here.  It comes with a small instruction booklet written in english and french and one AAA battery.  It works well and does what I want.  Very handy to have available for touch-ups around the ears, nose and eyebrows as needed. It probably works as well as other similiar priced trimmers.  I am satisfied with it and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Spouse likes it, I think that it costs too much (the reason for the 4 not 5 stars). These things used to be free with other bath utensils. Well packaged, hard to get the thick plastic separated.</li>
    <li> So far I have had this blade a little over two weeks and it&#x27;s working well.</li>
    <li> Worked well, but did not last beyond the year mark.</li>
    <li> I used mine like once a week and even after cleaning it after every use the next time it would not start. I would have to take it apart and move the arm up and down to get it started.It does not feel like it had enough power to move the small arm inside up and down. Maybe if it had 2 batteries or less friction inside. It does cut very close and has a very small head.</li>
    <li> Good product. Would buy again... Drains batteries fast but works well</li>
    <li> I have been using Remington detail trimmers for sometime now and find they are excellent. The only thing is that they need to be regularly cleaned and lightly oiled. If you examine the design and positioning of the blades on this trimmer you will be able to see why these are a better trimmer choice. The blades extend outward and are positioned perfectly to cut better than other similar trimmers.</li>
    <li> quit working after one use</li>
    <li> This is a perfectly simple moustache and beard trimmer in a compact form factor with only one attachment that you can leave on the device.  That one attachment has a long beard trimmer on one side and a short beard trimmer on its reverse side.  Be careful not to slice your thumb when you slide the attachment over the blades.  This trimmer uses on AAA battery which is included.</li>
    <li> The best tool for the job. I used one of these the last few years and am getting a new one because the last one has started to fail intermittently after over 5 years of use. This thing is way better than the more expensive trimmers on Amazon and other retail stores. I bought a few of the others that were more expensive and this thing is just perfect.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had two of these.  It&#x27;s a toy, hopelessly underpowered for whatever efficiency the cutter action utilizes.  It is uses a single AAA battery.  The battery runs down quickly, and performance is immediately impaired as the power level falls.  If this had a charger to drop into after each use, so you had a full charge every time you used it, it would be fine.  However it doesn&#x27;t, and cutting speed and quality drop too quickly with only one AAA battery.  At low battery power levels, it stalls and the cutting action is unacceptable, so you&#x27;re forced to throw out (replace) a half spent battery, and to install a fresh one, just to get acceptable performance. That gets expensive.  If you have a beard and mustache that requires regular attention, you need a trimmer that&#x27;s rechargeable, not this.</li>
    <li> broke after the first use.</li>
    <li> Very useful for nose and ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be sure that you keep fresh batteries in it, or it won&#x27;t be as effective.</li>
    <li> This was the worst product ever. Bought it, didn&#x27;t  work. Thought it might be the battery it came with, so changed the battery out. Still don&#x27;t know if it works or not, as I can seem to find a button that says &#x27;on&#x27; or &#x27;off&#x27;. It&#x27;s made of the cheapest plastic, and the blade looks flimsy. Will never buy another product by Remington. Ever. Taking it back to get my money refunded, and will gladly pay  a lot more for a decent product.</li>
    <li> I try to look in the mirror as seldom as possible. When I do, this type of trimmer seems to function well to maintain the areas that ordinary haircutting clippers fail to access. I had a similar trimmer years ago and it eventually \\&quot;froze up,\\&quot; so the note of the earlier reviewer about cleaning and application of a bit of light oil to the cutters should prolong the life of these trimmers.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done and a decent value for the price.  Won&#x27;t last forever, but expect to get lots of use out of it.</li>
    <li> Piece of junk. This is the third one I bought and it jams or breaks in just 5-6 uses. I only use it to trim my mustache and eyebrows, use it very lightly. Never Remington again!</li>
    <li> Worked well for a few months. Then stopped. And yes, I changed the battery.</li>
    <li> Great product. Works as advertised! A++</li>
    <li> Kind of cheap and only works ok. But I would recommend it at this low price. Very small light and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Installed battery. Used ONCE. Tried to use two weeks later and the unit did not operate. Glad I bought another from Wahl as a backup</li>
