      <li>I use this primarily to make stock, soaking the bones in a tad of vinegar and lots of water to leach out the minerals.</li>
      <li>Too light in color and no mother in the bottle.  </li>
      <li>2-3 times a day mixed with a cup of R.O. water and noticed some good and welcome things such as much better energy and digestive health.  </li>
      <li>useful for ur skin :)</li>
      <li>There are so many uses for ACV its worth a try.</li>
      <li>I could not recommend Apple Cider Vinegar any higher!!</li>
      <li>ACV is very powerful stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>But did you know that ACV in the drinking water of you chickens makes for happy, healthy chickens that can fight off many of the common ailments of poultry and strengthen the immune system?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The one benefit I do find is after consistently doing this I do seem to have more energy.  </li>
      <li>It is apparently a potent, natural anti-inflammatory, and many scientists are concluding that inflammation may be either the root cause or a contributing factor in almost every disease.&lt;br</li>
      <li>this stuff has positively changed my life, just as I&#x27;ve heard about from so many others.</li>
      <li>I use one tablespoon full in a shot glass and mix with juice.</li>
      <li>Dilute it I use full strength</li>
      <li>Awesome as usual!</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly.  </li>
      <li>IT REALLY WORKS!!  </li>
      <li>The product itself looks fresh.</li>
      <li>For athlete&#x27;s foot or jock itch we were amazed to experience how effective apple cider vinegar is when used daily or even both morning and evening.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed myself having more energy , less of an appetite , my skin has improved and even my hair is more healthy and has some new growth.</li>
      <li>I like it very much.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;a little pricey but good stuff.</li>
      <li>, yes, I love and swear by the ACV very strongly still, even if just for those three uses, at the least.</li>
      <li>If I start to sniffle or sneeze a bit, I get back to having 2 tablespoons per day, and I feel perfectly healthy again in no time.</li>
      <li>Exactly as advertised.</li>
      <li>the first sign of a sore throat</li>
      <li>Exactly what it says on the bottle- apple cider vinegar.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Great, reliable product for the whole family!</li>
      <li>I have been on medications for years for my stomach not emptying correctly and for the sphincter at the bottom of my throat ( top of stomach) was somehow damaged and doesn&#x27;t close properly and stomach contents leak upwards after a meal.  </li>
      <li>Maybe further diluting it would work better</li>
      <li>Bought this mainly interested in clearing my acne.  </li>
      <li>I had been taking this ACV for about a whole bottles worth (maybe 2 months) at two tsp.</li>
      <li>The first thing I noticed was my sinuses opened up.  </li>
      <li>Still new user so time will tell, if the taste is worthy.</li>
      <li>, I begin to gargle with ACV (2 teaspoons in a 1/2 cup of water), and it goes away, very quickly, with no hint of further symptoms.</li>
      <li>Easy enough to replace, but I lost about a cup of product and the post office</li>
      <li>We have been trying to add Apple Cider Vinegar to our daily diet for health reason, but grocery-store products tasted and smelled too strong for us.</li>
      <li>I keep a large bottle in my kitchen and one in the bathroom.  </li>
      <li>This worked very well.</li>
      <li>It seems to stop a cold and is an excellent aid in digestion!  </li>
      <li>I believe the Bragg&#x27;s is very helpful in that regard.</li>
      <li>and it has really helped her skin.  </li>

<ol>
    <li> I feel healthier by the day!  Great deal.</li>
    <li> Works well but taste will burn mouth and throat.</li>
    <li> I always come back to Bragg&#x27;s as the quality is the best for Apple Cider Vinegar. It definitely has become a part of my daily regiment.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly.  Wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Apple cider vinegar is very good for you. however make sure you follow their directions I had heart burn!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use in my animals water bowl.</li>
    <li> I use this primarily to make stock, soaking the bones in a tad of vinegar and lots of water to leach out the minerals. This product works well.</li>
    <li> My order was received before expected. This apple cider vinegar is the best I&#x27;ve ever tasted. It is beyond comparison to normal processed varieties. I recommend it. Try it - you&#x27;ll like it or like me love it.</li>
    <li> Great product, it&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for, Top shelf product. I have already reordered.&lt;br /&gt;a little pricey but good stuff.</li>
    <li> Omg the taste is not the most desirable,  but if it holds true to some of the claims then it can be tolerated. The first thing I noticed was my sinuses opened up.  I could breath easier. The next day I felt upbeat,  I just had a different stride in my step. Still new user so time will tell, if the taste is worthy.</li>
    <li> We have been trying to add Apple Cider Vinegar to our daily diet for health reason, but grocery-store products tasted and smelled too strong for us. In addition to the benefit of being organic, this product is very mild in taste and smell (easy to ingest) and seem to have very potent health benefits.</li>
    <li> I bought this product as a remedy for my acne. The product itself looks fresh. the packaging was good as well. I have been applying it, diluted with some water, on my face. The big and tough acne have almost stopped after i started using it on my face. But i still get small pimples here there every now and then. I hope I will see better results soon.</li>
    <li> I have to say the package came promptly and well put together. I am very satisfied with this product and its quality.</li>
    <li> Although I have not purchased through Amazon YET, this product is amazing.  I keep a large bottle in my kitchen and one in the bathroom.  I take 2 tablespoons each morning in a shot glass diluted with organic orange juice.  It seems to stop a cold and is an excellent aid in digestion!  I also have psoriasis and have tried everything for years, and this is working!!  I use it diluted on a cotton pad.  If you are like many other older women who have spent a fortune on creams claiming to fade age spots, only to be let down over and over, try diluted ACV on a cotton pad.  IT REALLY WORKS!!  It has faded age spots on my hands!  I love this product!!!!</li>
    <li> Exactly what it says on the bottle- apple cider vinegar. A bit stronger than the stuff I bought from the grocery store, but I&#x27;m pleased with the results. I drink a little myself and put some in my pet&#x27;s drinking and bath water, and I have occasionally used it on salad to good effect. A nice, good quality all-round cider vinegar.</li>
    <li> I wanted an organic version since it&#x27;s not sold in my area so I bought this. I&#x27;ve used ACV for my hair and its anti-fungal properties and PH balance help get the build up off of my scalp when needed. I also use it in a foot soak and it helps to take the dead skin right off. There are so many uses for ACV its worth a try.</li>
    <li> I have noticed a Difference as well as others Iv seen in feedback. I have been buying for many years. And to me it still taste that night bubbly zing. I do like it. BUT... It does not have as much mother as in the past. In fact I do not see ANY sediment (mother) at the bottom at all. And before there was alot. So if I am going to pay 25 bucks counting shipping,for a gallon,I want the the mother they had in the past. I will have to contact the company seeing this is a vast disappointment. Heine s in walmart has the mother at the bottom Just like Bragg&#x27;s USED too,That is sad.  Note I bought the 32 oz glass jar 1st saw the difference. Thought it was a fluke thing. Then bought the gallon same thing.</li>
    <li> I been using this for quite some time for my acid reflux.  I like the taste of this over other brands.  But my great surprise was when I found out it stops the hiccups. Try it!</li>
    <li> Very strong, you will smell this coming into the room.  Yes there is a &amp;#34;mother&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One star off for the vinegar leaking all over the other stuff in the box, it was not packaged securely and the lid didn&#x27;t hold up to shipping.</li>
    <li> For athlete&#x27;s foot or jock itch we were amazed to experience how effective apple cider vinegar is when used daily or even both morning and evening.  Now there&#x27;s a surprise!</li>
    <li> useful for ur skin :)</li>
    <li> Awesome as usual! Use it as conditioner, in my bone broth, and for cooking bear!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It is really good for detoxing.</li>
    <li> I have been buying this ACV for two years and Bragg&#x27;s has the best ACV.  Both my daughter and I use it as a facial toner.  I do 50/50 ACV/purified water.  Best toner I have ever used.  My daughter does 80 purified water/20 ACV because she has acne/rosacea/sensitive skin and it has really helped her skin.  ACV is also an antiseptic so it&#x27;s great on pimples/acne. I sometimes add a quarter teaspoon to my tea or water, etc. to keep my system cleaned out but I can only handle a small amount.  ACV is very powerful stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I, like other customers, had problems with my last order of Bragg&#x27;s that I purchased through Amazon because it did not look the same.  Too light in color and no mother in the bottle.  It looked like barely colored water.  I called Bragg&#x27;s directly and they said that they were using a different apple that was lighter in color and I thought that was a bunch of BS.  I felt that she was doing damage control.  She sent me a couple of bottles that looked more like the Bragg&#x27;s I always have ordered from them in the past.  I took a chance and decided to order this bottle through Amazon and this seller.  I was very happy because it looks just like the original Bragg&#x27;s so I am very happy with this seller and they did a great job packaging this glass bottle.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff.I would probably purchase again.No it doesn&#x27;t taste the greatest,but you could mix it with orange juice or something.I would totally recommend this to any and everyone.</li>
    <li> received the wrong product. Not received the apple cider vinegar, received a canola oil. Please check the products before sending.</li>
    <li> Thank you . Love this product and it was very nicely packed and very fast shipping.</li>
    <li> 10,00000 uses for it!</li>
    <li> ACV is great for many things.  Recently had terrible rash on face, arms &amp; legs.  Believe it was poison ivy since I had been working in the yard.  Terrible itching &amp; was spreading.  Decided to apply ACV full strength to rashes with a cotton face pad &amp; it burned but not terrible.  Within a couple days, noticed the rashes drying up &amp; then disappearing.  I believe the ACV would help with all skin problems.</li>
    <li> I could not recommend Apple Cider Vinegar any higher!! It has changed my life like nothing else! Re-reading my previous review today, makes me want to get back to taking the stuff regularly every day again, but in truth I haven&#x27;t been doing that. However, it has been displayed on my kitchen counter without exception now, for the whole time, right next to my coffee pot! I take it about half as often as I would like to, but I still take it several times a week, and I always remember it first thing, when my allergies start to creep up, or there are colds going around at work or in the family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the first sign of a sore throat, I begin to gargle with ACV (2 teaspoons in a 1/2 cup of water), and it goes away, very quickly, with no hint of further symptoms. If I start to sniffle or sneeze a bit, I get back to having 2 tablespoons per day, and I feel perfectly healthy again in no time. If I could remember to do it every single day, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d ever get that sniffle to begin with! So for immunity and allergies... this stuff has positively changed my life, just as I&#x27;ve heard about from so many others. Yes, it still tastes and smells pretty bad, but you are done with all of that in less than 20 seconds. Are you really such a wimp that you can&#x27;t handle something minorly uncomfortable for as little as 20 seconds, when the results are so undeniable?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thirdly, I love how ACV can get rid of the warts I&#x27;ve had on the backs of my hands and fingers for years, permanently, in no time at all. All I did was scratch the wart up a bit with a clean sewing needle, then soak a small piece of cotton (perhaps torn from a q-tip), place that on top of the wart, and secure it snuggly with a band-aid. Then, for two days, I would re-soak that piece of cotton, replace the band-aid if necessary, and the wart would almost certainly be gone within 48 hours. But me being me, I usually continue to do it for an extra day just to be sure. From my experience, and from a few others whom I&#x27;ve convinced to try this, it works at least 90% of the time, or 100% of the time if they need to do it again a second time with a little bit of deeper scratching from the pin. This doesn&#x27;t hurt! All you are doing is scratching the wart&#x27;s thick outer layer so that the ACV can seep down into the root.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, yes, I love and swear by the ACV very strongly still, even if just for those three uses, at the least. Others have worried that I am just saying all this to sell bottles of Apple Cider Vinegar, but I am certainly not! I&#x27;ll happily repeat... this stuff is cheap! There are MANY brands that are just fine, so long as they are raw and have &amp;#34;the mother&amp;#34; in it. I&#x27;ve used 5 different brands over the past 2 years and have noticed no difference other than if one brand was cheaper than the other! So what do you have to lose? My attendance at work has been better than ever in my entire life, and I am now using my sick days for personal days off instead, or else I get a check at the end of the year because I didn&#x27;t need to use them- I couldn&#x27;t be happier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, for weight-loss, and cholesterol, please read this review I&#x27;ve written:&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMDWL7KIPD5G2/ref&#x3D;pdp_new_read_full_review_link?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;page&#x3D;1&amp;sort_by&#x3D;MostRecentReview#R27BJFRZFPX2XX&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve given up sugar a month and a half ago, and lost 31 pounds (I still would like to lose another 30). The author calls it a diet, but it has changed my life already in so many ways in addition to the weight loss! I&#x27;ve learned that I have a dreadful addiction to sugar, and some people may not have as big a problem with it as I do, but sugar has zero benefit, and giving it up, while increasing fiber, has been nothing less than an exceptional experience! I think my ACV use has complimented my results as well! I&#x27;m not saying that you need to buy this book, but if you&#x27;ve think you might be addicted to sugar and cheap carbs too, I highly recommend you research what giving up sugar can do for you!ch what giving up sugar can do for you!</li>
    <li> Gives lots of energy!</li>
    <li> Buy somewhere else. This is a complete rip off. Way too expensive. You can buy the same product for 1/3 of the cost. Wish I could get a refund for the difference.</li>
    <li> To put it simply I havent gotten sick since drinking this. I use one tablespoon full in a shot glass and mix with juice. Cheers. Try it took about two weeks to feel a noticeable difference. I take it at least once a day. I also use on my face for acne. Dilute it I use full strength my acne is under control.</li>
    <li> I LOVE tHIS PRODUCT!  I use this Apple Cider Vinegar all the time!  It tastes wonderful, and helps not only my tummy, but also, 1/2 teaspoon helps my dogs&#x27; tummys too!</li>
    <li> The lid blew off the glass bottle.  Easy enough to replace, but I lost about a cup of product and the post office wasn&#x27;t happy about it.</li>
    <li> Definitely a slightly different taste than the regular clear ACV but I like it. Will switch from my previous brand to this one.</li>
    <li> ACV is great for you!  Organic ACV, with the mother in it, is the best, and in my opinion, Bragg does it best.  But did you know that ACV in the drinking water of you chickens makes for happy, healthy chickens that can fight off many of the common ailments of poultry and strengthen the immune system?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great, reliable product for the whole family!</li>
    <li> Tastes great and makes you feel better. Just take a shot of this everyday with some water. Kinda of like a DIY energy drink.</li>
    <li> I live in ecuador and don&#x27;y know why don&#x27;t give me de 8 botles, later make me a refund ok, but only for 5 of 8 botles that charge me, I don&#x27;t know how recoup my money</li>
    <li> Great, perfect product!</li>
    <li> I had been taking this ACV for about a whole bottles worth (maybe 2 months) at two tsp. 2-3 times a day mixed with a cup of R.O. water and noticed some good and welcome things such as much better energy and digestive health.  Well, I just went to SeaWorld and didn&#x27;t think about bringing any along.  My big mistake!  I have been on medications for years for my stomach not emptying correctly and for the sphincter at the bottom of my throat ( top of stomach) was somehow damaged and doesn&#x27;t close properly and stomach contents leak upwards after a meal.  So cognizant of that, on the trip, I had very been careful of my diet, specifically the meal times and amounts, to no avail.  Soon as I got home and started my routine of two or three times a day, problem symptoms have disappeared.  There seem to be so many uses and benefits of this solution you&#x27;d think this would be talked about and recommended much more often.  Psst, I did find this 32oz. bottle at Wallyworld for half this price.  Enjoy the many benefits and mild flavor!  Peace</li>
    <li> the product arrived on time and in great shape . I have been drinking apple cider mixed with water for forty plus years and this brand is as good or better than most. I like it very much.  thank you  John</li>
    <li> Bought this mainly interested in clearing my acne.  I&#x27;ve tried both drinking it and using it on my face and it hasn&#x27;t worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Topically: Tried using it on my face as a toner.  Mixed it 50/50 with water and applied it before bed.  I did this about a week and I went from having mild-moderate acne to the worst breakout I&#x27;ve had in 10 years.  The type of breakout where you don&#x27;t want to leave the house.  Maybe further diluting it would work better but after that I&#x27;m not willing to try this on my face again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drinking: Been drinking a tablespoon twice a day mixed with water for almost 3 months.  Taste isn&#x27;t nearly as bad as I expected from the smell.  Hasn&#x27;t done anything for acne.  The one benefit I do find is after consistently doing this I do seem to have more energy.  I&#x27;ve basically given up caffeine and it hasn&#x27;t been difficult.  But for acne this hasn&#x27;t worked for me</li>
    <li> This vinegar tastes great and has so many health benefits. I never want to be without it. I love the glass bottle!</li>
    <li> Great Product! you should definitely use it with the Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay Deep Pore Mask.</li>
    <li> This is one of the unsung products of our time that drug companies don&#x27;t want you to know about. I had horrible indigestion for a long time. Interfered with my sleeping and quality of life. I started taking a tablespoon of this two or three times a day at the beginning and within a couple of weeks the indigestion was completely gone. I had tried all kinds of other things from medicines to changing of my diet and probiotics. This worked very well. Now I take it maybe once a day or once every two of three days and the indigestion stays away. After a while, I got out of the habit of taking it and the indigestion came back as bad as ever. I started with two or three times a day again and it again stopped. Now I make sure I take it every two or three days and that seems enough to keep the indigestion in check.</li>
    <li> Love the product have used for many uses...digestive problems, acne..etc..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years now - to keep my hair and skin healthy, for gut health, and weight loss.  I use it everyday.  It&#x27;s a terrific product.</li>
    <li> I use 1 tablespoon of this apple cider daily in 8 ounces of low-sodium V8 juice. It tastes terrific, and apple cider vinegar has numerous health benefits including: stabilizing blood-sugar levels, detoxifying the liver, aiding digestion, lowering blood pressure, helping with allergies, and relieving joint pain. It is apparently a potent, natural anti-inflammatory, and many scientists are concluding that inflammation may be either the root cause or a contributing factor in almost every disease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have arthritis in two fingers and a thumb, and I have no pain from it at all. I believe the Bragg&#x27;s is very helpful in that regard.</li>
    <li> I purchased this vinegar for health reasons. I had been suffering from a pretty severe case of Gerd for about a while, and I simply refused to become dependent on prescription meds. And it was pretty bad! In fact, so bad that I have had panic attacks that were attributed to not being able to breathe due to severe heartburn. It had gotten to the point where nearly everything I consumed caused me grief and the 14 day OTC Prilosec treatment was no longer effective. After researching alternatives, I read that raw apple cider vinegar could help, if not completely alleviate, my problem. So I stumbled upon the Bragg&#x27;s brand, and after reading countless reviews/praise, I took the plunge and purchased! I am OVERJOYED that I did! I did as advised and, first thing in the morning 30 minutes prior to eating, added at least a tablespoon to 8 oz. of water. It was slightly difficult to consume with the taste, but I was determined (not to mention, I got used to it after the first few tries). Afterwards, later in the day, I consumed some cheese, which is most definitely a heartburn trigger, but so hard for me to give up completely. I had an episode of heartburn, but it definitely was less harsh than normal! Then from the second day on, no matter what I consumed, I had ZERO issues!!! I cannot believe how effective this vinegar has been! It is now a staple in my kitchen and daily routine! Not to mention, it makes my baked chicken taste divine! I am a very happy consumer!</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> Loving this stuff ! So many  health benefits to drinking this. I&#x27;ve noticed myself having more energy , less of an appetite , my skin has improved and even my hair is more healthy and has some new growth. I use 2 tablespoons in 16 ounces of water with some organic cayenne pepper and honey . You won&#x27;t be disappointed !</li>
