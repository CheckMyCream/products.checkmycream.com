      <li>This is one of my favorite bronzer because it is not too dark or pigmented.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Having fair skin I am thrilled to finally find a bronzer that gives a subtle and natural glow that looks like I spent some time in the sun.</li>
      <li>Would recommend to anyone looking for a new bronzer.</li>

      <li>It can go on really light for daytime, or heavy for a night out on the town.</li>
      <li>Very Natural, I have used Bare Minerals for years, it never disappoints</li>
      <li>Definitely a big fan of the new &amp;#34;BEready bronzers!</li>
      <li>so it lasts much longer than the loose powder versions.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s Bare Minerals</li>

    <li> I love BareMinerals new solid mineral formulations.  So much easier to apply!! This bronzer goes on smooth without too much shimmer.  I would only recommend this color for very fair complexions(skinny dip). I have a light-medium skin tone and this bronzer is way to light for me. I should have gone up a color. On the upside, I&#x27;ve decided to use it as a light contour to sculpt the cheeks.  Even though, this color isn&#x27;t bronzy enough, I still found a great use for it.</li>
    <li> Wonderful color!  Now, if I can just learn to use it!</li>
    <li> This is so much better then their loose powder bronzers that I&#x27;ve been using for about five years. I&#x27;ll never go back.

    <li> Great color.. (I tried the lighter of the 2 shades due to being a fair haired blonde)..hasnt made me break out and lasts a long time..only wish it would come w a brush or applicator instead of having to purchase separate. .</li>
    <li> Just a fantastic bronzer. I am ghost pale and prone to acne. Last for months.</li>
