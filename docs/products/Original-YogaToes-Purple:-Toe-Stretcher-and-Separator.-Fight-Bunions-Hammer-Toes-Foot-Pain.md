      <li>Love them.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I did,</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re not really meant to walk around in, and I can see how they would get stuck on any type of sheet or blanket, but if you&#x27;re just sitting and doing something, they&#x27;re great!</li>
      <li>, my feet feel more comfortable even though my choice of footwear hasn&#x27;t changed.  </li>
      <li>but I love that they help with my toe/foot pain and are relaxing and comfortable to use.</li>

      <li>these fit well, and</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a significant decrease in my foot pain.</li>
      <li>and I picked both the YogaToes Gems and the Original YogaToes for us to try.</li>
      <li>However, until that time happens, it sure is nice to sleep through the night without the constant foot pain spasms.  </li>
      <li>However, until that time happens, it sure is nice to sleep through the night without the constant foot pain</li>
      <li>After a long day on your feet, these definitely give them a wonderful stretch and you feel better after</li>
      <li>Now in my second career I spend a lot of time on my feet and sometimes my toes and feet just need a good stretch.</li>
      <li>actually seems to feel good and works to polish nails as well</li>
      <li>They give the toes on my size 6.5 feet a good stretch and aren&#x27;t so big that it hurts.</li>
      <li>Oh my goodness I love these so much.</li>
      <li>I received a Free sample for an evaluation; however, the usages, my personal results, statements and opinions are my own.</li>
      <li>I used it few times and feels great.</li>
      <li>I am a barefoot, minimalist shoes devotee, and I am currently studying body alignment and how healthy and flexible feet are key to good alignment.</li>
      <li>My sister-in-law’s situation is the toes on her right foot had begun to curl under and her toes are too close together.</li>
      <li>, the YogaToes are made of a very soft and pliable gel-like material, which is quite flexible and easily manipulated between the toes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>only received this product yesterday, and have only used them 3 times so far, but I&#x27;m very happy with them.  </li>
      <li>These definitely spread your toes and make them feel better.  </li>
      <li>so I was pretty nervous about buying.</li>
      <li>I do not have any difficulty wearing the YogaToes Originals; however, I am using the YogaToes Purifying Spray to moisten my toes first, which enables the gel material to slide easier between my digits.  </li>
      <li>It did take a bit of finessing to get them on at first but now that I&#x27;m used to it</li>
      <li>At first you might ask yourself - what the heck am I doing?</li>
      <li>my feet are relaxed and pretty again.</li>
      <li>a lot and my feet ache in the evenings and sometimes - many times - even the next morning.  </li>
      <li>Really helpful to spread and stretch toes;)</li>
      <li>My feet feel great after a little stretch, especially at the end of the day.</li>
      <li>These re really helping my arthritic toes.</li>
      <li>Work very well for bunion relief.</li>
      <li>I use an arch bandage with it the end of my day for 30mins.. with a glass of wine, haha.</li>
      <li>gives my toes much needed relief.</li>
      <li>omggggg if you wear high heels you NEED this!</li>
      <li>/&gt;I received a Free sample for an evaluation; however, the usages, my personal results, statements and opinions are my own.m for about an hour.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s going to be another month or two until I try wearing high heels to work, but I have hope it will happen again!</li>
      <li>My sister ended up ordering a pair because they helped with my pain so much.</li>
      <li>Immediately after ordering these I had some fears that I&#x27;d fallen prey to a gimmick, but they really do work.  </li>
      <li>I am hoping that with consistent use, the damage may reverse for correction since I no longer live in my stilettos every day of the week.  </li>
      <li>I am hoping that with consistent use, the damage may reverse for correction since I no longer live in my stilettos every day of the week.  </li>
      <li>They provide more stretch for your feet than some of the other types I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>When my feet are very sore, I give them a good massage with lotion after my shower, but I was looking for something that would really give my feet a little something extra.  </li>
      <li>Not sure it does anything honestly</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s not a quick fix, but because my feet do feel better</li>
      <li>They are of decent quality but WAY over-priced.</li>
      <li>The older</li>
      <li>I find them comfortable to wear for about an hour, and I am able to walk while wearing them and even climb the stairs, although I would never win a foot race while they are on my feet.</li>
      <li>I find them comfortable to wear for about an hour, and I am able to walk while wearing them and even climb the stairs, although I would never win a foot race while they are on my feet.</li>
      <li>The quality seems good, I can see these lasting a long time - they do get fuzzy and need rinsing regularly, no big deal.</li>
      <li>I work 9 hours per day in an office, I run on concrete, and I dance ballet.</li>
      <li>so you feet look normal.</li>
      <li>These are really great to keep my extra long second toes from crossing over the big toe.  </li>
      <li>I bought this on a whim because my big toes are abnormally large and tend to smash the toes immediately next to them, especially when I wear high heels and more fitted shoes.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great product but the space for the big tow is the same as the space for the small toes.</li>
      <li>I still get quite a nice stretch from these extra smalls and they relieve just everyday foot tension for me.</li>
      <li>It fits well for her just as we expect as we choose extra small size thinking that it will fit better for Asian toes.</li>
      <li>So far these haven&#x27;t really worked for the second purpose since it spreads my toes out a little too wide to fit inside the small LED light I use to cure the gel polish, but I&#x27;m LOVING them for foot comfort.  </li>
      <li>I can definitely feel a stretch, but it&#x27;s not uncomfortable.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used them for about 2 weeks &amp; so far they seem to increase flexibility in my toes.</li>
      <li>This really is the only drawback though</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also been pleasantly surprised</li>
      <li>They fit - even my small, narrow feet; they&#x27;re comfortable; they&#x27;re compact and portable.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> After 30 years of wearing between 4 – 5 inch stiletto heels on my boots and shoes, five to seven days a week, I had eventually caused some nerve damage in my feet.  My pain starts in the evenings, and sometimes after I am asleep, I awake from a shooting pain that starts in my arches, extends to my toes, and then shoots half way up my legs.  The result is that my toes go numb and I need to use my hands to manually press my toes and the top of my feet hard in a forced upward position, (while gasping for breath) for the pain to finally subside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By coincidence, my sister-in-law recently had a diagnoses of hammertoes, so I decided to try the YogaToes for our conditions and I picked both the YogaToes Gems and the Original YogaToes for us to try. My sister-in-law’s situation is the toes on her right foot had begun to curl under and her toes are too close together. Upon forcing her toes through the Originals, she had a substantial amount of pain, and immediately took them off, so she chose the YogaToes Gems, and I tested out the Originals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not have a problem with curling toes, my situation is both foot pain and toe ‘spasms’ for the three smaller digits of my feet, which leads to numbness, pain, and poor foot balance, as I tend to balance on the outside part of my foot in the evenings.  I do not have any difficulty wearing the YogaToes Originals; however, I am using the YogaToes Purifying Spray to moisten my toes first, which enables the gel material to slide easier between my digits.  I am able to walk in the Yoga Toes, and even up and down the stairs, although I do not walk with the grace of a ballerina, but neither is my stride like a robotic Frankenstein.  Actually, they are similar to my foam separators that I use when I paint my toenails.  However, there is a difference, my toe separators are a hard foam material that is not flexible and my toes will start aching after a short time. The Yoga Toes are made of a more flexible gel, and I am able to wear them for about an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Results:  For two and a half weeks, I wore the Yoga Toes about every other night for an hour in the evenings, and I did NOT experience any foot pain during the night.  Then I stopped wearing the Yoga Toes for five days in a row, and unfortunately the toe ‘spasms’, numbness, and foot pain came back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, the YogaToes Originals have eliminated my personal foot pain, toe spasms, and numbness, as long as I use them for an hour a session, a few times a week. They have also improved my balance so that I am not walking on the outsides of my feet as I start to tire in the evenings. I find them comfortable to wear for about an hour, and I am able to walk while wearing them and even climb the stairs, although I would never win a foot race while they are on my feet. I am hoping that with consistent use, the damage may reverse for correction since I no longer live in my stilettos every day of the week.  However, until that time happens, it sure is nice to sleep through the night without the constant foot pain spasms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Reference Purposes – Both my sister-in-law and I wear a 6 ½ shoe and the extra smalls work perfectly for us both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a Free sample for an evaluation; however, the usages, my personal results, statements and opinions are my own.m for about an hour.

    <li> I probably could have used a small instead of x small. I would rather had a solid  form instead of having the ends split.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used them for about 2 weeks &amp; so far they seem to increase flexibility in my toes.</li>
    <li> A little odd at first but I like the stretch they give.  Seems to help with plantar fasciitis.  My feet feel great after a little stretch, especially at the end of the day.</li>
    <li> These re really helping my arthritic toes.</li>
    <li> Gift for my daughter who is a dancer and loves yoga. She says they are fantastic!</li>
    <li> They give the toes on my size 6.5 feet a good stretch and aren&#x27;t so big that it hurts. Quite happy with this size</li>
    <li> actually seems to feel good and works to polish nails as well</li>
    <li> For size 6.5 shoes these are still waaay too big.  I couldn&#x27;t get all of my toes in them at the same time.  The material is nice and cushy and I get how these could be helpful, just they need to fix the sizing chart!</li>
    <li> Awesome for the end of the day!</li>
    <li> I work 9 hours per day in an office, I run on concrete, and I dance ballet. Plus I have flat feet. You can imagine the pain I feel in my feet...&lt;br /&gt;This product really helps me relax after a long day and I can already notice my toes looking prettier and more slender.</li>
    <li> Not all my toes spread easily when I&#x27;m doing yoga but they spread easier since I started using the Yoga toes.</li>
    <li> These are definitely worth the money! I have had numerous leg surgeries and my feet and toes have begun to hurt. I also have two hammer toes.These definitely spread your toes and make them feel better.  I am a shoe size 6B and I ordered the EXTRA SMALL.</li>
    <li> These are wonderful for my toes!!  I wear 3 to 4-inch high heeled shoes and at the end of the day, these feel awesome on my feet.  I also take them with me when I get my pedicure.</li>
    <li> I thought I had ordered a Small, but I received an Extra Small.  I am using them anyway.  They did tear shortly after I started using them, but are still usable.  I have noticed less foot pain, so maybe they are working.</li>
    <li> Oh my goodness I love these so much. I am flat footed and was a professional dancer for almost 7 years. I have messed up feet to say the least. Now in my second career I spend a lot of time on my feet and sometimes my toes and feet just need a good stretch. These do the trick while I am bumming out on the couch.  I read numerous reviews of people saying yoga toes were painful the first couple of times they wore them so I was pretty nervous about buying. I didn&#x27;t have a single problem! I definitely recommend!!!!</li>
    <li> If you have severe bunion problems this will take time, so be patient and you have to use daily. It won&#x27;t  remedy the bunions, but will help get your toes in maybe a little better alignment just depends on how bad your bunions are to start with.</li>
    <li> Although I wear size 5 shoes, I&#x27;m surprised that the XS doesn&#x27;t give enough of a stretch to my toes.  Should have ordered size S.  They are of decent quality but WAY over-priced.</li>
    <li> I wear a size 7 shoe and these fit well without being too painful. I have a fallen arch and arthritis in my big toe on one foot and I can feel the stretching along my arch when I wear the Yoga Toes. Word of caution, when the instructions say to start slowly, you should! I left them on too long on day and I paid for it for a couple days afterwards. I try to increase the length of time by 5 minutes a day and that seems to be working for me.&lt;br /&gt;With the arthritis (maybe a bunion too), my big toe pushed into the other toes and sometimes my second and third toes would go numb. Since I started using the Yoga Toes, my big toe is not as pushed over as it was and no problem with pain or numbness. It&#x27;s going to be another month or two until I try wearing high heels to work, but I have hope it will happen again!</li>
    <li> I bought this on a whim because my big toes are abnormally large and tend to smash the toes immediately next to them, especially when I wear high heels and more fitted shoes.  The older I get the more it seems to bother me so these seemed like a nice option to provide relief and I also thought as a side benefit I might be able to use them as toe separators when I give myself a gel pedicure.  So far these haven&#x27;t really worked for the second purpose since it spreads my toes out a little too wide to fit inside the small LED light I use to cure the gel polish, but I&#x27;m LOVING them for foot comfort.  I&#x27;m not going to lie.  Immediately after ordering these I had some fears that I&#x27;d fallen prey to a gimmick, but they really do work.  I&#x27;ve been wearing them 20 minutes to an hour 3-4 times a week for a month and overall, my feet feel more comfortable even though my choice of footwear hasn&#x27;t changed.  My toes also seem more flexible and it&#x27;s getting easier to separate them.  My big toe still does smash the toes immediately next to them so it&#x27;s not a quick fix, but because my feet do feel better I&#x27;m hoping they will continue to improve the separation between my toes over time.  I&#x27;ve also been pleasantly surprised that after the first couple of times these stopped feeling uncomfortable to me.  They do feel like a slight stretch but to me it is in a pleasant, not an unpleasant way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a size reference, I will also say that I wear a size 7-7.5 in women&#x27;s shoes and these fit me perfectly.  Even though my big toes as I said above are quite large I find the spaces for my toes fit perfectly and no force is necessary to work these on.  It did take a bit of finessing to get them on at first but now that I&#x27;m used to it I can put them on and take them off quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really the only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the material is ever so slightly sticky and seems to attract dust and other particles.  It makes me wish they came with a carrying case to hold them in between uses or that I at least had the foresight to stick them in a baggy because I brought them on vacation with me and they quickly got sandy and dirty.  This really is the only drawback though and I quite love them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, I haven&#x27;t found these to be perfect to be used as separators when doing gel pedicures but I love that they help with my toe/foot pain and are relaxing and comfortable to use.</li>
    <li> These are really great to keep my extra long second toes from crossing over the big toe.  Just have to remember to use them -</li>
    <li> I have bought this product as a present for my mom. It fits well for her just as we expect as we choose extra small size thinking that it will fit better for Asian toes. Although it is a bit hard to put it on by mom herself without applying some cream, but overall it works wonder for her to separate the toes from one another. Thanks</li>
    <li> Very comfortable. Wear them for an hour every night. Working on balance in Pilates</li>
    <li> I work 40 hrs a week and am on my feet 8 hrs a day. Not to mention on my days off i wear stilettos. The shoes I was wearing started giving me a hammer toe on both feet I was mortified. I saw these online and I tried them for a week and I feel 100% better. I can&#x27;t even believe the difference I no longer have a hammer toe on either foot my feet are relaxed and pretty again. It did take a few days to get use to these but by day 3 I was accustomed to them.</li>
    <li> At first you might ask yourself - what the heck am I doing? After a few times wearing you will understand what they are doing for your feet. They are stretching out YEARS of abuse. Love them.</li>
    <li> I love these Yoga Toes! I was having a painful problem with my feet cramping during my yoga practice, and after just a week with these, worn only an hour at most every evening, the problem started to disappear. I&#x27;ve used them for a little while now, I have not had these annoying and painful foot cramps at all for about a month! I use them every evening when I sit down to read or watch a movie. They&#x27;re not really meant to walk around in, and I can see how they would get stuck on any type of sheet or blanket, but if you&#x27;re just sitting and doing something, they&#x27;re great! I would recommend.</li>
    <li> These definitely work.  After a long day on your feet, these definitely give them a wonderful stretch and you feel better after</li>
    <li> A very healthy habit to get into, if you can be disciplined enough to wear these for a few minutes everyday. They are good quality and easy to use. I wear size 5 shoes and the XS fits me perfectly. They provide more stretch for your feet than some of the other types I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> They help a lot with bad feet.</li>
    <li> I discovered this item while I was researching foot massagers because I&#x27;m on my feet a lot and my feet ache in the evenings and sometimes - many times - even the next morning.  When my feet are very sore, I give them a good massage with lotion after my shower, but I was looking for something that would really give my feet a little something extra.  Due to my research, I discovered that the two smallest toes on my right foot are showing signs of the beginning of &amp;#34;hammer toe&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;claw toe&amp;#34;.  The are just beginning to curl under, despite the fact that I&#x27;ve been living in flip flops for about the last 5 years - no more tight, confining toe boxes.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I wear a size 5 shoe and have rather narrow feet and the extra small YogaToes, surprisingly, are working well for me.  I can definitely feel a stretch, but it&#x27;s not uncomfortable.  There&#x27;s just the tiniest bit of discomfort, when I first put them on, between my little toe and the one next to it on my right foot - which are the toes that are beginning to curl under.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the YogaToes are made of a very soft and pliable gel-like material, which is quite flexible and easily manipulated between the toes.&lt;br /&gt;I only received this product yesterday, and have only used them 3 times so far, but I&#x27;m very happy with them.  They fit - even my small, narrow feet; they&#x27;re comfortable; they&#x27;re compact and portable.  I was so happy with them, I bought a pair for my daughter to try.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been getting sore feet a lot lately, so I thought I&#x27;d try these -- they actually make everything from your toes to your arches feel stretched and relaxed after you use them. The first few times it&#x27;s a bit uncomfortable, but, like regular yoga, you just keep trying and eventually it&#x27;ll work!</li>
    <li> gives my toes much needed relief. I use an arch bandage with it the end of my day for 30mins.. with a glass of wine, haha.</li>
    <li> small was still too large</li>
    <li> omggggg if you wear high heels you NEED this! does a great job with separating your toes so you feet look normal. you NEED to read instructions and gradually wear them longer because your feel need to get used to the stretching. Results will not happen over night, so be patience.</li>
    <li> A bit pricey, but the cheaper versions didn&#x27;t have size options and I have very small feet so I opted for the extra expense. I&#x27;m glad I did, these fit well, and I&#x27;ve noticed a significant decrease in my foot pain.</li>
    <li> I wish I would have bought these years ago. Great stretch for the feet.</li>
    <li> Really helpful to spread and stretch toes;)</li>
    <li> Feel good and cute as a button!</li>
    <li> Work very well for bunion relief. I got the XS and have 6.5 size feet and they fit perfect. My sister ended up ordering a pair because they helped with my pain so much. My only complaint is they are like a gel so everything (blanket or carpet fuzz) stickes to them, also they are very hard to walk in so you have to have some time to sit if you want to wear them.</li>
    <li> I have crooked toes and the Yoga Toes help. They do take a while to get used to.</li>
    <li> I bought extra small YogaToes because shoes have made my toes stay tightly together. However, there was too much space between the toes, even using the extra small. YogaToes stretched my toes apart too much, causing pain. I suggest smaller spaces between toes for new users, and a way to gradually increase this space.</li>
    <li> My chiropractor recommended me to get a pair. I do not have bunions, but I dance in pointe shoes, so I thought I should do something to relax my feet and toes while I am not en pointe. I used it few times and feels great. I can&#x27;t use more than 30 minutes yet (it gets a bit painful afterwards) but I am sure I will get used to using them soon. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Not sure it does anything honestly</li>
    <li> Helps me with my neuropathy.  Soothing</li>
    <li> I LOVE these. I am a barefoot, minimalist shoes devotee, and I am currently studying body alignment and how healthy and flexible feet are key to good alignment. I am a solid size 7. Even though I am in minimalist (zero-drop, wide toe box, no cushioning, padding) shoes 90% of the time, my feet still need a good stretching. I try to wear these twice a day for around half an hour at a time. Because my feet are so flexible and I can spread my toes quite far by themselves, I probably could have sized up to small, but for the average shoe wearer, I think the sizing is correct. I still get quite a nice stretch from these extra smalls and they relieve just everyday foot tension for me. The quality seems good, I can see these lasting a long time - they do get fuzzy and need rinsing regularly, no big deal. Happy feet!</li>
    <li> Extremely uncomfortable.  Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Not crazy about these, hard to put on, and not seeing a difference. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product but the space for the big tow is the same as the space for the small toes. It doesn&#x27;t fit either, the big toe space is a little small and the toe space for the small toe is way too large and painful.</li>
