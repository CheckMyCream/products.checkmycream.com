      <li>Great mug.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s unbreakable and it does a great job holding heat.</li>
      <li>It holds heat very nicely.  </li>
      <li>I have used it for many months now, and it is still perfect.</li>
      <li>I use a soap that comes in a bar style, but it easily works into the shape of circle and sits perfectly on bottom of mug.&lt;br /&gt;Ordering</li>
      <li>This mug lives true to it&#x27;s name on the quality and feels very great in my hands while I am shaving.</li>
      <li>I am very satisfied with it and would recommend it to others.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Heavy duty, wont chip or break, holds heat well for warm</li>
      <li>You need a nice brush with it.</li>
      <li>Ager breaking a couple of mugs, two bowls and a nice coffee cup, I went for this.</li>
      <li>Soap fits nicely into the bottom.  </li>
      <li>more could you want from a shaving mug?</li>
      <li>I use it mostly with Williams mug soap, put a couple inches of the hottest water I can get out of the tap in it, and let it soak while I soak my brush and my beard.</li>
      <li>expect to use this mug for many years to come.&lt;br /&gt;Size</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know what else I could ask for in a shave mug, but whatever I think up, I&#x27;m sure this will do it.</li>
      <li>The color just makes it stand out as its own unique object.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been dropped on steel decks and flung across my stateroom in high seas and still whips up some great lather.</li>
      <li>Great, soft rubber, unbreakable.</li>
      <li>but you&#x27;ve got better things to think about than whether the soap is corralled or is free range.  </li>
      <li>It is over size and makes it easy to whip up a lather.</li>
      <li>Mine stays in the shower and looks fine after months of use.</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure at first, but like it a lot!  </li>
      <li>I liked it so much</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in the Navy and therefore need something that can take a beating but still fit in a seabag.</li>
      <li>Not sure if I liked the built in ring on bottom, but found it to be great.  </li>
      <li>Seems to me, that&#x27;s true.</li>
      <li>Is nice and I keep it to try a puck in the near future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The Marvy Green Rubber Shaving Mug is by far the best shaving mug available.  </li>
      <li>The mug is light and well-designed and absolutely perfect for traditional wet shavers.  </li>
      <li>Plenty of room left for nice lather.</li>
      <li>Just put the soap in microwave first to soften it and mold it into the bottom of cup.</li>
      <li>I put an ounce or two of hot water and the brush before jumping in the shower.</li>
      <li>Maybe better with a smaller brush.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Just add hot water to mug, put your brush on the water, let it soak 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Remove</li>
      <li>so I could easily keep various soaps straight</li>
      <li>Nice but a little pricey for a rubber cup.</li>
      <li>The hard rubber material seems to be a good design choice for the intended use.</li>
      <li>I also do not have to worry so much about dropping it on my tile floor.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Col. Conk 2.25 oz size, and it fits very snugly.  </li>
      <li>Then empty out the water, and shake most of it off the brush.  </li>
      <li>doesn&#x27;t look like much.  </li>
      <li>It may be to keep the soap out of standing water or it may be that some pucks of soap will fit inside the ring; mine doesn&#x27;t so the soap scoots around a tiny bit for a day or 2 until it softens and sticks in place</li>
      <li>I highly recommed it.</li>
      <li>Hot lather is ready 30 seconds later.  </li>
      <li>Near future) after 2 tubes and one bowl of proraso cream I decide to try a puck again, the first time I just put the puck inside the mug a press firmily to attach soap to the bottom ring, don&#x27;t work, puck move and can built a lather.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little big for Proraso soap, but it works ok.</li>
      <li>on 15 seconds steps until completely melt the puck, then wait one or two days  when solid is ready to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
      <li>Note, the hot water in the tap(at least not in my house) is not hot enough to soften the soap, and retain enough heat to provide a luxurious hot lather, so better heat some water in in a kettle, or microwave.</li>
      <li>When looking for a shaving mug to take with me on deployment, I searched high and low because all I could find were ceramic or flimsy metal mugs.</li>
      <li>Hard rubber texture and mug has a rim inside to fit shaving soap.  </li>
      <li>It is not heavy like the only ceramic shaving mug I have owned.  </li>
      <li>But I don&#x27;t care about such things, so for me it is not a minus.</li>
      <li>The mug is just a little bit too large for my taste and for my bathroom shelf.</li>
      <li>This method uses up my shaving soap much faster, but with Williams mug soap at $1, and shaving only every 2-3 days a week, I still use less than a fistful of $$ per year on shaving soap.  </li>

<li> Does the job I expected.</li>
<li> Only small minus is the mug  </li>
<li> a little snug to make lather with my omega pro48.  </li>
<li> so it may not fit on a medicine cabinet shelf if you need to conceal it there.</li>
<li> dropped a few times no damage to mug</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on anything else.</li>
<li> My comments are on based on the GREEN Rubber mug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I have the green model.</li>
<li> Unlike a regular mug, there is no risk of dropping it and then stepping on broken ceramic.  </li>
<li> Please note this mug is designed to be used with a soap puck, is not good for cream.</li>
<li> I got this to add to my offbeat mug collection of dollar store chili mugs and sale priced ceramic bowls.</li>
<li> It won&#x27;t break, or make horrible clinking noises.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought on a while ago. Wanted a second. Nice but a little pricey for a rubber cup. Is in breakable so that&#x27;s a big plus, for slipper hands on a bathroom tile floor, it just bounces away without shattering</li>
    <li> Nothing fancy but gets the job done; a must have for beginning wet shavers. Has a place for soap puck, fits a Van Der Hagen luxury soap puck with some trimming. Don&#x27;t think about it just get it!</li>
    <li> This thing is just about perfect!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my travel/army shave mug. I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> If you shave in the shower, this cup is for you.  Unlike a regular mug, there is no risk of dropping it and then stepping on broken ceramic.  Soap fits nicely into the bottom.  Plenty of room left for nice lather.</li>
    <li> EDIT: My comments are on based on the GREEN Rubber mug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heavy duty, wont chip or break, holds heat well for warm lather.&lt;br /&gt;What more could you want from a shaving mug?</li>
    <li> Rubber &#x3D; doesn&#x27;t break when bumped against a sink or dropped.  It is not heavy like the only ceramic shaving mug I have owned.  Ugly old coffee mugs work fine too but they break.  There is a raised ring in the bottom of the mug. It may be to keep the soap out of standing water or it may be that some pucks of soap will fit inside the ring; mine doesn&#x27;t so the soap scoots around a tiny bit for a day or 2 until it softens and sticks in place but you&#x27;ve got better things to think about than whether the soap is corralled or is free range.  It is 4\\&quot; in diameter so it may not fit on a medicine cabinet shelf if you need to conceal it there.</li>
    <li> I got this to add to my offbeat mug collection of dollar store chili mugs and sale priced ceramic bowls. The ring at the bottom works perfect for keeping a soap puck in place. I use it mostly with Williams mug soap, put a couple inches of the hottest water I can get out of the tap in it, and let it soak while I soak my brush and my beard. It&#x27;s unbreakable and it does a great job holding heat. It gives you plenty of room to whip up a rockin&#x27; lather. I don&#x27;t know what else I could ask for in a shave mug, but whatever I think up, I&#x27;m sure this will do it. Don&#x27;t waste your money on anything else. This is what you need.</li>
    <li> This mug lives true to it&#x27;s name on the quality and feels very great in my hands while I am shaving.</li>
    <li> Great, soft rubber, unbreakable. Please note this mug is designed to be used with a soap puck, is not good for cream. Is nice and I keep it to try a puck in the near future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Jan 2, 2016&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two years later (Ha! Near future) after 2 tubes and one bowl of proraso cream I decide to try a puck again, the first time I just put the puck inside the mug a press firmily to attach soap to the bottom ring, don&#x27;t work, puck move and can built a lather. So I put aside the soap puck and continue using shaving cream with my brush and child size cereal bowl leaving this mug to wash my razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now with no cream left to use I tried the puck again but before that I read some reviews for this mug and found (finally) the correct way to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just put the puck in the mug&lt;br /&gt;Mug in the microwave oven&lt;br /&gt;Heat on 15 seconds steps until completely melt the puck, then wait one or two days  when solid is ready to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to use it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just add hot water to mug, put your brush on the water, let it soak 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Remove water from mug and shake excess of water out of the brush.&lt;br /&gt;Move the brush in circles against the puck and in no time you have enough lather to shave an army.</li>
    <li> The Marvy Green Rubber Shaving Mug is by far the best shaving mug available.  It is the right size, and made of durable hard rubber.  There is a clever &amp;#34;shaving soap puck holding ridge&amp;#34; at the bottom of the mug which holds the shaving soap in place and when you whip up the shaving soap with your shaving brush, the hard rubber keeps the brush from clacking on the side of the cup.  The mug is light and well-designed and absolutely perfect for traditional wet shavers.  I highly recommed it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s big selling point is that it is indestructible. Seems to me, that&#x27;s true. The mug is just a little bit too large for my taste and for my bathroom shelf.</li>
    <li> too deep ...... doesn&#x27;t hold shaving soap well</li>
    <li> wish they had this same product in other colors so I could easily keep various soaps straight</li>
    <li> It won&#x27;t break, or make horrible clinking noises. It&#x27;s a little big for Proraso soap, but it works ok. You need a nice brush with it. Mine stays in the shower and looks fine after months of use.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure at first, but like it a lot!  Hard rubber texture and mug has a rim inside to fit shaving soap.  Not sure if I liked the built in ring on bottom, but found it to be great.  I use a soap that comes in a bar style, but it easily works into the shape of circle and sits perfectly on bottom of mug.&lt;br /&gt;Ordering another one for another type of soap.</li>
    <li> Great mug.  I have used it for many months now, and it is still perfect. I have the green model. It holds perfectly a puck of shaving soap at the bottom. Just put the soap in microwave first to soften it and mold it into the bottom of cup. Only small minus is the mug  doesn&#x27;t look like much.  But I don&#x27;t care about such things, so for me it is not a minus. It holds heat very nicely.  I put an ounce or two of hot water and the brush before jumping in the shower. Then empty out the water, and shake most of it off the brush.  Hot lather is ready 30 seconds later.  This method uses up my shaving soap much faster, but with Williams mug soap at $1, and shaving only every 2-3 days a week, I still use less than a fistful of $$ per year on shaving soap.  Note, the hot water in the tap(at least not in my house) is not hot enough to soften the soap, and retain enough heat to provide a luxurious hot lather, so better heat some water in in a kettle, or microwave.</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace a smaller glass cup. It is over size and makes it easy to whip up a lather. Since it is made of rubber I also do not have to worry so much about dropping it on my tile floor. I am very satisfied with it and would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> as said a rubber mug.  a little snug to make lather with my omega pro48.  Maybe better with a smaller brush.  dropped a few times no damage to mug</li>
    <li> This mug is great! It&#x27;s big and green and rubber, so it won&#x27;t break when I inevitably drop it in the shower (where I shave). The color just makes it stand out as its own unique object. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nothing fancy, but it does the job and will surely last forever.  After having used it for a few months, I don&#x27;t miss my old ceramic mug at all.  The hard rubber material seems to be a good design choice for the intended use. There is a ring in the bottom to hold a puck of soap in place... I&#x27;ve been using Col. Conk 2.25 oz size, and it fits very snugly.  I imagine that&#x27;s a &amp;#34;standard&amp;#34; size puck. I haven&#x27;t tried larger pucks with this mug, and I don&#x27;t think I will.  The mug seems designed for the smaller ones.</li>
    <li> Ager breaking a couple of mugs, two bowls and a nice coffee cup, I went for this. Does the job I expected. Of course I dropped it, but it is still there.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in the Navy and therefore need something that can take a beating but still fit in a seabag. When looking for a shaving mug to take with me on deployment, I searched high and low because all I could find were ceramic or flimsy metal mugs. Until I stumbled upon the Marvy Rubber Mug. This thing is great. It&#x27;s been dropped on steel decks and flung across my stateroom in high seas and still whips up some great lather. I liked it so much I now have two of them.</li>
    <li> This may be the best value shave mug available.&lt;br /&gt;I expect to use this mug for many years to come.&lt;br /&gt;Size is perfect for puck soaps.</li>
