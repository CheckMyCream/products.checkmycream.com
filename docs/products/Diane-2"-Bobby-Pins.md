<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Fast delivery!  Very happy about that ..</li>
    <li> These are very well made!  When I received the box I was...underwhelmed...by the size.  But after opening them and seeing how many there are in there and how well made they are, I am TOTALLY satisfied.  Great product!  I recommend!</li>
    <li> Your basic bobby pin. I had hoped they were the same product I purchased about ten years ago (that&#x27;s  about how long these will last a person!) but I couldn&#x27;t remember the brand. These are not quite as nice, but they do the job just fine.</li>
    <li> It feels like I have a lifetime supply of bobby pins! Great quality and fantastic value.</li>
    <li> Arrived before the delivery date. Exactly as listed</li>
    <li> Literally my best purchase here on Amazon. These are great quality Bobby pins that&#x27;ll last you a lifetime. Nothing bad to say at all</li>
    <li> Funny smell. And some of the coating comes off when removing from hair.</li>
    <li> strong lovely, does not twist( thank god)</li>
    <li> I use bobby pins all the time, and I used to buy the 20 or so pack from the local store and end up losing them all in a month. So I decided to buy this 1 lb box and wow, there are so many in there. I&#x27;ve given a bunch to a friend and I know I&#x27;ve lost a few but I still haven&#x27;t even gotten half way through the box.</li>
    <li> Wow! I will likely never have to buy bobby pins again. Super good value.</li>
    <li> These might be ok for thick hair, but for thin to regular hair these bobby pins are not strong enough to hold in place.  They are also just plain metal and don&#x27;t have the outer coating that also helps hair stay in place.  They were a waste of money and I would not buy again.</li>
    <li> A bajillion bobby pins came in this box. Pins work great and the little rubber tips haven&#x27;t come off like some brands. Gave it a 4 star instead of 5 because the box has little black flakes all over that I assume are paint flakes. Didn&#x27;t have this issue with the brown ones.</li>
    <li> There was a truck load. Well maybe not but there was alot. Should last a long time. Very happy.  Will be getting again</li>
    <li> Super high quality pins. Great bargain. I&#x27;ll never overspend on a smaller pack ever again.</li>
    <li> If I ever run out of bobby pins again my husband says that they aren&#x27;t meant for me to have! They are sturdy and perfect</li>
    <li> I bought these because they came highly recommended by a hair guru; however, I find the Goody ones from the drugstore holds my hair way better than these (I have thin hair but a lot of it).  The price is great but you get what you paid for: loose pins and the paint was already flaking off onto my hands when I put the first two pins in my hair.</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE GREATEST THING AND SO CHEAP YOU GET LIKE 700 BOBBY PINS I WONT RUN OUT FOR AT LEAST A MONTH 😏 for real though buy this!</li>
    <li> It is what i paid for. Lots of bobby pins all though i wanted a bigger box for the buck spent</li>
    <li> These pins are great because they are tight and stay in place.</li>
    <li> Great deal! I lose these things like nobody&#x27;s business so it&#x27;s really handy to have 4 pounds of it laying around.</li>
    <li> I love it. It&#x27;s good quality and the price is right for about 600 pins.</li>
    <li> I used to think that all bobby pins were created equally... until I met these!  I wanted some in bulk since we are always losing them, but now I&#x27;m hooked on this brand!  I&#x27;ll never buy cheap store brands again.  These never get crossed when I try to open them, nor do they get stuck in my hair (like cheap ones when the little plastic tip covers would peel off and pull my hair out with it!)</li>
    <li> So many bobby pins come in here. Cannot count them all but I would say easily at least 300 come one box. Shipping was fast and great quality bobby pins.</li>
    <li> Lot&#x27;s of pins.  Delivered on time.</li>
    <li> Great price for 1 lb of bobbin pins. Use for hair for brides maids during wedding</li>
    <li> Although the quality of this pin is fair, the &amp;#34;black&amp;#34; covering peels off after a couple of uses. Now I am gathering a bag of&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;silver&amp;#34; hairpins in my Black hair (:-(. I just have to dispose of them. Will not purchase these again.</li>
    <li> I push my pins to hold way more hair than they should so they are always over bent and hardly reusable. Now I don&#x27;t have to worry for awhile.</li>
    <li> this is exactly what i needed, the box was organized and the pins were not all over the place. i highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Amazing value for bobby pins. I go through them quickly because I don&#x27;t usually recycle them (shame on me, I know). So since bobby pins are pretty much disposable for me, this is an awesome deal. They&#x27;re good quality, standard bobby pins. And you get like a zillion of them. Would buy again (in like 5 years when I get through these).</li>
    <li> These are so worth the bit of extra cost. They really hold in place.</li>
    <li> I love them. They do not fall like other brand. I don&#x27;t think I will ever purchase Bobby pins any time soon</li>
    <li> This box has a ton of bobby pins, way too many to even count. I do wish the box was sealed up a little bit better. Due to &amp;#34;rough&amp;#34; shipping practices the contents of this whole 1lb box spilled everywhere inside the amazon box that was sent to me.</li>
    <li> I like the pins are secure and it&#x27;s a great deal. The only slight problem with the pins is that the black paint chips off.</li>
    <li> When i got these they were all over in the box.</li>
    <li> I never worry about losing Bobby pins anymore</li>
    <li> No marks or tears when I opened the package. The product came fast and it was in excellent condition as expected. Needed and using it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always losing bobby pins and keep having to buy new packs usually spending $3 for 30count or so. So when I saw that I could get a pound for about $6 I had to get them. My boyfriend is not so happy. He hates finding these all over the house. They are great and hold my hair in place.</li>
    <li> I lose bobby pins nearly everytime I wear them, so paying $4-$5 per 18 pack, or whatever at the store was unjustifiable for me.  These pins are good quality, hold well and a huge bargain.  Definitely worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I opened my amazon box which also contained a few other items and there were bobby pins spread throughout the box. The box with the bobby pins was broken. Also there was a black powder over all my items. When I examined the bobby pins it became clear that they were chipping. All of the ones I looked at had some sort of paint missing. The box of bobby pins was pretty large but not worth getting black powder everywhere.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll still use them for securing buns and other styles that aren&#x27;t very delicate, but these pins don&#x27;t open very easily.  I&#x27;m used to opening a bobby pin a little before putting it in my hair, but these go crooked and useless if I try to slightly open them.</li>
    <li> These do shed their coating fast.</li>
    <li> This is a lot of bobby pins... I could throw half away and still have more than a lifetime supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;They work just like a bobby pin should and hold their tension.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box is horrible. It is very hard to this seemingly unlimited supply of bobby pins in the box. We had to move the pins to another container&lt;br /&gt;because the box likes to explode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pain chips... The pins rub against each other in the box and the paint likes to chip off. After a few uses the paint will flake off in your hair or around the house. This alone would warrant a one star review, however, the sheer number of pins for the price offsets the reduction in quality. Just use the pins once and toss them if the chipping  and flaking is a big annoyance.</li>
    <li> So. Many. Bobby pins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just.... wow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Combine this with the &amp;#34;Goody Ouchless Pillow Pack Black Elastics, 4mm, 70 Count&amp;#34; and you&#x27;ll never run out of hair containment devices again. Your significant other, roommate, or parents might get a little miffed at the shear quantity of them that you can now lose about the house, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But seriously, these pins are strong, not brittle, and the edges are smooth for easy insertion.</li>
    <li> I got these to shut my gf up. She’s ALWAYS complaining that she doesn’t have bobby pins, so I bought here these as a gag gift. She gave me that “YOU PUNK” look and we shared a good laugh. When I asked her if she liked them, or if they worked, she in a smart ass response told me they did the job. I think she&#x27;ll be good on bobby pins for a while.</li>
    <li> Im plotting to take over my boyfriends house so I&#x27;m just going to scatter them everywhere to mark my territory and hope i have enough left to actually do some fun hair styles... or at least thats what he thinks. Honestly I just loose them so easily they fall out of my hair or my bag and then its like a game of friggn pick up sticks for the rest of the year. I have no problems with this product.</li>
    <li> The only reason I am rating these so low is because the black on the pins flakes off and is always on my neck, ears and face. Annoying. Otherwise a lot of pins for a good price.</li>
    <li> Love these! You can&#x27;t by pins like these at the store...these are the kind they use in hair salons. I have to get these because I have such thick hair...the cheap ones from the store don&#x27;t get the job done. But these are awesome, and there are so many in the box that I don&#x27;t have to worry about losing them because I have so many!</li>
    <li> I was quite shocked at how heavy the box was! Completely full of bobby pins. It&#x27;s nice that they are in a box. Easy place to keep them. The box is probably actually heavier than 16 oz (lb). So I felt like I got a good deal. The bobby pins have been great so far. They don&#x27;t slip or fall out. I have VERY long hair and it kept all my hair in a bun etc. Good deal. Highly recommend to others.</li>
    <li> Overall it is good product. But from recent order, I did found a lot of the pins are very soft, which are just very rare from my previous purchase. I hope the manufacturer could see this and improve it!</li>
    <li> These are sturdy bobby pins, and there are so many! I doubt I will  have to purchase another package of these anytime soon, they will last forever!</li>
    <li> I will never buy those small packets of bobby pins again! These are the best!</li>
    <li> These are really good bobby pins. I use bobby pins pretty much every day and these hold up really well. I also know that I will never run out with this many, and it&#x27;s such a bargain since at a store you could buy a pack for like $4 with maybe 100 bobby pins, so you&#x27;re getting your money&#x27;s worth with these. Definitely a great buy!</li>
    <li> I love these and I won&#x27;t be running out any time soon. They don&#x27;t snag my hair. :)</li>
    <li> Certainly worth the buy! I am no longer constantly digging around the bottom of all my purses and bags, in every nook and cranny to find bobby pins! I just keep this big boy right on the counter in my bathroom for easy access! As crazy as it seems I think I might also be losing less bobby pins with this big box.. I feel more inclined to redeposit my bobby pins back into the box instead of just lazily leaving them everywhere. Then again I&#x27;m probably just crazy! haha still a good buy!</li>
    <li> As per other reviews, when I got these in, there was black paint dust everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;The opening seems narrow, but they hold pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, not bad, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy these again.</li>
    <li> Such a great buy!  I used bobby pins all the time, and I lose them all the time.  I run out like crazy and to buy the small packs at the drug stores is craziness.  They are so expensive for only 20-30 bobby pins, here I have probably a couple thousand.  No joke, I had before bought 1,000 from another company and this is a lot more.They are great quality too.  They are firm and strong, made well.  Sometimes you buy bobby pins and they are flimsy and weak.  You will not be disappointed here.</li>
    <li> I mean, I can give it a lower rate but I&#x27;m not a bitchy girl. The box came in a tattered purple box, but it was still intact with bobby pins from the bottom to the top. I&#x27;m glad to say that theses bobby pins were very worth the money. I&#x27;d buy even more as a gift to a girl that has hair needs! It&#x27;s probably going to take me 10 years to use it all because of how I conserve my pins. Overall, I would tell you to go for it and buy it. Its amazing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I bought this, I usa bobby pins everyday and buying in bulk makes life a lot easier.</li>
    <li> Great little pins, handy since I use these often. Great price for so many.</li>
    <li> The quality of the Bobby Pins isn&#x27;t that great, they tend to twist and warp all funny. Good news is it does get the job done.</li>
    <li> they are exactly what I want in bobby pins</li>
    <li> The price is as much as a small pack at the drug store and you get a huge box of pins.  I go through these huge so am so happy I bought 2 boxes.  One for me and one for DD.</li>
    <li> Ill be throughly surprised if my wife ever runs out of bobby pins with this box. It has increased the number of random lonley bobby pins around the house though. So husbands know what your getting into. They might as well be craft glitter cause your gonna find these things 50 years from now.</li>
    <li> Exactly what they claim...good price for the amount.</li>
    <li> Thought the price was great.  But they don&#x27;t hold as well as i thought they would.  They become ajar after one use and i end up tossing them. Good thing there&#x27;s over 700 of these babies. But once  again,  the grip wasn&#x27;t totally great . Also box inside was crushed.</li>
    <li> The bobby pins are certainly numerous, but not of the highest quality necessarily. Quantity here trumps the inherent quality.</li>
    <li> WILL DO BUSINESS WITH AGAIN</li>
    <li> These are typical bobby pins, they will hold just fine and seem to have no problem with twisting. The super cheap bobby pins twist when you try to put them in your hair. The only negative is that the paint or whatever the black coating is chips. The rubber tipped ends seem to stay on just fine, I&#x27;ve found problems with that as well in other pins. Great price for pins that will probably last a couple years, or even longer if you don&#x27;t perpetually lose them like me.</li>
    <li> These are probably better for one time only use.  I like to pin up my shorter hair and re-use pins.  When sprayed with hair spray the paint melted off.  (What was in that hair spray!?)  They also loosen grip pretty quickly and are &#x27;sprung&#x27; out of shape and go into the trash.  I wish I had just purchased higher priced regular pins to re-use.</li>
    <li> The paint comes off in your hair, and the tips do too. I only get about 3-4 uses out of each one. Seems a waste to me.</li>
    <li> These bobby pins are hold up better than the ones I&#x27;ve bought at the drug store. They hold my hair better as well. So far they are working great. And there are a TON in the box. I won&#x27;t have to buy any for a long time.</li>
    <li> Very great product and great price. These have a great grip on the hair and it came with a lot!</li>
    <li> I have two of these boxes, but oh my goodness...one can last you forever! I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll need to go looking for bobby pins for the rest of my life. These are a great essential to have. The only negative is, as the other reviewers have said, the black &amp;#34;paint&amp;#34; on these pins do chip off (SOME of them) and when a greasy/oily product gets on them, it makes it chip off even more, but not so excessively to the extent where I&#x27;m finding stuff in my hair and it&#x27;s making a mess. Just a few chips here and there. I guess it&#x27;s tolerable. Can&#x27;t argue much about this product. It&#x27;s good deal and all-in-all you get what you pay for. I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> Very sturdy pins. With my super thick hair its hard to find ones that dont bend out of place when i try to use them. Needless to say the walmart ones usually aren&#x27;t reuseable for me. These definitely are though. I&#x27;ve only had one that stretched a little too far it wouldn&#x27;t close again. So glad i made this purchase. I won&#x27;t be buying Bobby pins for a looonnggg time.</li>
    <li> bobby pins are bobby pins</li>
    <li> I bought these after deciding to a straw set! I have not done the straw set yet, but it feels great having enough bobby pins in one area without me having to stumble around!</li>
    <li> These are great! Most bobby pins only stay in my hair for 10 minutes without me needing to re-pin them, but these ones stayed in for hours!!! (I cross them in an x position, but I could see it staying even without doing that)</li>
    <li> I had no idea just how many pins would be in a 1lb box. I haven&#x27;t counted them but I will never run out (I think this box is meant for beauty salons rather than individuals). I will probably give some to friends and family too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price was right and they hold my very curly and thick hair just fine.</li>
    <li> Good quality.  HUGE box.  Happy customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you lose pins all the time like me, order this box immediately :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t say anything negative about anything with this order.</li>
    <li> How much can you say about bobby pins?  These seem to be well made and certainly a bargain at this price.  I am happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I use them everyday since I got so many, but the curved part is wider (I measured about 5 mm) than the vidal sassoon bobby pins.</li>
    <li> I love these bobby pins!  They are a little shorter than the ones I remember from over 50 years ago BUT they work.  They are tight -- holding my hair nicely.  These are the first bobby pins with the &amp;#34;rounded tips&amp;#34; that actually work!  These rounded tips are a part of the bobby pin thus they will not come off or get your hair caught in the &amp;#34;seam&amp;#34; where rounded tips were added.  AND they are a great deal!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the number of pins for the price!</li>
    <li> Terrible pins. It is too soft to hold the hairs up. As I order it through international shipping, it&#x27;s just too troublesome to return it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t if I actually got a pound, but I sure did get a lot of them. They do what they are expected to do.</li>
    <li> Well.... they are good pins, and seem to hold up very well. Unfortunately there is a downside, not in the product, it seems perfect, its with the end user. There are now bobby pins everywhere I look in my house.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Enough bobby pins to for my hair and craft projects.  Also, I attach labels to the bobby pins and use them to name seedlings in my greenhouse.</li>
    <li> They keep the kippot on the good old cabezza! What else is there to say?</li>
    <li> a ton of basic bobby pins,  its pretty much that, they are what they are.</li>
    <li> They are black but they blend in well with my light brown hair. Haven&#x27;t had any issues with them yet.</li>
    <li> This has a ton of bobby pins in it, they were actually overflowing when I took it out of the package, I will for sure have to put them all in a ziplock bag because there&#x27;s too many for the little box it came in. I love bobby pins, but just like everyone else you can go from 15 to none in like a week so I was tired of wasting my money continuously buying new packs that I decided to get this, GREAT BUY! The price is excellent and for those wondering how many a pound is, this includes about 700 bobby pins. I couldn&#x27;t find a better price and I love the Diane bobby pins, they aren&#x27;t the cheapo ones in the dollar and hair store.</li>
    <li> Giant container of hairpins.  What&#x27;s not to love?  Very durable, don&#x27;t bend at all.  Great bargain and value.</li>
    <li> Packaging sucks but there&#x27;s so many that I find them everywhere throughout my house. For the price I will never buy them at the market again.</li>
    <li> A fantastic bargain. If you use a reasonable amount of bobby pins for anything, this is for you. These pins hold their shape and have coated tips. Very happy with them.</li>
    <li> I am a Natural chick and my hair tends to swallow bobby pins so when i found this box of the bobby pins that i like at its great price i couldnt resist. And i am happy with my buy. A pound of pins is more pins than you could think i believe its between 680-800 bobby pins</li>
    <li> They work great, save for the occasional without a head (ouch!), but I honestly didn&#x27;t expect that many. Probably a lifetime supply.</li>
    <li> Cant beat the price!! Havent used them yet but im sure they will do the job! Id buy these again just for the price cuz I use them all the time</li>
    <li> Excellent value, but a lot of the pins were not well made- they were missing the little plastic protector things on the ends, so I had to throw them away. Overall though, I would buy them again, although I will probably never have to ever purchase bobby pins in my life.</li>
    <li> I ordered these because I liked that they came in a box for storage.&lt;br /&gt;The image is slightly misleading in that the bottom of the bobby pin is slightly shorter then the top. I don&#x27;t like these kind. I prefer the kind where both sides ends are even.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the black coating flakes off very very  easily and has made a bit of a mess where the box is placed.</li>
    <li> There are Enough to last a lifetime. They have a  good price as well. They have the rounded head. Thanks</li>
    <li> Still using this with my whole family</li>
    <li> The bobby pins do their job well of securing my hair. It&#x27;s nice for people who lose or use lots of bobby pins. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the the black chips off in some places.</li>
    <li> Not very thick! Barely use one pin for several of times</li>
    <li> i should have found a better brand, these are cheap and twist shut when i try to open them, very disappointed</li>
    <li> Every girl needs a pound of bobby pins. I&#x27;m so tired of losing mine and the packs of 30 just don&#x27;t last long enough. They&#x27;re great quality and you can&#x27;t even feel them. I&#x27;m very happy about my purchase</li>
    <li> Great Product!  Fast shipping!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> You definitely get a lot of bobby pins for the money but after just one use, you&#x27;ll be brushing black paint out of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;d be perfect if they weren&#x27;t painted.</li>
    <li> A really good deal! I love the fact you can get a pound of bobby pins! Way better than buying at walmart or target.</li>
    <li> Really do like the quality! The price is really good, as is the quantity!</li>
    <li> Not the best quality of bobby pin.</li>
    <li> As a hairstylist, these are great! Great for updos, very strong. U counted one box to see if its worth the money. 686 pins in the one i counted.</li>
    <li> Great price point for the amount of bobby pins. However, the black coating is constantly chipping off. This includes the coating on the ends of the bobby pins, which leads to my hair hair snagging when removing these. I find that I end up just throwing a lot of them out. I also noticed the actual box these arrived in was damaged. Didn&#x27;t matter much since I planned to transfer them to a different container. Still pretty annoying though as the pins began to fall out as I opened the box. Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I lose these things SOOOOOO much.  I live in Arizona so updo&#x27;s are pretty much life right now.  These help my hair stay up and look less like a sweaty, scraggly mess when I have to be outside for more than a minute.  My boyfriend hates them though.  Apparently these things breed and find their way into every single place ever.</li>
    <li> Amazing Bobby pins I love them. And they hold well in thick hair. I lose these things like crazy and the box is still full...wow</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think I will ever run out of bobby pins again and I use them daily and constantly lose them. I have pretty thick hair and these keep it in place all day. Not to mention the price is about what you&#x27;d pay in a drugstore for maybe 50. This box has at least HUNDREDS. Definitely recommend these.</li>
    <li> With a daughter who&#x27;s in theater and is a majorette, we were going through bobby pins like nobody&#x27;s business! This convenient box means never running out, and not having to pin them back on those flimsy little cards. Everyone asks where we got them every time we use them! Haven&#x27;t had one break yet, either.</li>
    <li> Never a bobby pin around when I needed one.  This is a full pound and soo happy I got these.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a strong pin that wouldn&#x27;t snag my hair.  This one is both weak and snags when I pull them out.</li>
    <li> Great bargain since I always seem to lose them. But they do rust quickly if left near any liquid.</li>
    <li> Pro: you get a ton, more to last one girl a life time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: i have thick, wavy hair and these things dont seem to hold up my hair. i have to use a lot of them to keep a section of hair in place. they bend or loose shape really easy. i think i might have to pass these along to my sister who has very thin/fine hair.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and bobbies are good quality</li>
    <li> These hold so much better than your drug store variety bobby pins. Bought because I saw them recommended on The Small Things Blog. Glad I did. (It&#x27;s a huge box so they&#x27;ll last forever.)</li>
    <li> This is a great deal! A pack of 90 bobby pins details for $4-5 where I live so you can&#x27;t beat this price. These pins are slightly smaller than others I&#x27;ve used which won&#x27;t be a problem for me because I&#x27;ve got thin/fine hair. They work as well as any others I&#x27;ve used. I think this box will last me years even though I lose bobby pins like crazy.</li>
    <li> My house is now lousy with bobby pins and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> Such nice bobby pins they are very sturdy and hold in hair nicely and stay there unlike some other bobby pins, I would definitely buy again but so many come in the box for such a low price it might be a while before I run out!</li>
    <li> A huge box for a great price!</li>
