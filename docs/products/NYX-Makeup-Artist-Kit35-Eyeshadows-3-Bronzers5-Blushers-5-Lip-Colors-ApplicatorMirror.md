<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard so much about how good NYX is, but not so great for this brown girl.  The pigments are not that rich and some are a little ashy looking.  and Yes I use a primer by UD.</li>
    <li> Love it! It was just what I was wanting. So glad I got it! Came in perfect condition, no broken eyeshadows or anything.</li>
    <li> This product first arrived to me and was shattered - so I could not tell what the color or pigmentation was like. I called amazon and they quickly sent me a new kit. The new kit arrived in perfect condition - but I was once again disappointed. The colors in the photos seem much brighter and the colors in front of me were very dull. The pigmentation is OK but the colors themselves were not as vibrant as they appear in the photos. May be a good kit for someone who is a beginner and has yet to collect very many products, but overall it is not very impressive. Will be returning.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my mother for Christmas, and I was so excited, I mean who wouldn&#x27;t be excited to give someone a professional make up kit for a present. Anyways, my mother opened it, and one of the blushes were busted! making the whole entire product filthy with the blush. It has taken me two days to clean it up! I called to return so I could get a new one, and I couldn&#x27;t! All I got back was $7. I won&#x27;t be ordering from this company again, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
    <li> I received this compact as a gift from my boyfriend for Christmas and even though it wasn&#x27;t my biggest gift it is my favorite. EVERYTHING you could possibly need is in this one compact other than your foundation, eye liner, and mascara... HONEST! I have had several eye surgeries and the skin around my eyes is very thin so eye shadow seems to wear off or crease but, these products do not, they also blend very well and are not glittery but have a nice hue to them. I literally think you could wear a different combination of colors for every day of the year. I will say however, the brushes included are more of a bonus... use your own brushes and keep the ones in the compact for your purse or \\&quot;as an emergency set\\&quot;. Enough can&#x27;t be said about how many small eyeshadow, and blush compacts I have been able to eliminate with this one kit. It&#x27;s simply a time saver and it keeps you so much more organized. I would recommend it to all my friends, in fact any of my friends who have seen it want one... so that&#x27;s says a lot.</li>
    <li> Arrived broken and it was tough to return.</li>
    <li> I purchase this product for my 17 year old daughter.  She loves it!!!!! I found out about this product on an episode of \\&quot;The View\\&quot;.  They were talking about the best Christmas gifts.  Of course I went straight to my favorite online store. Amazon.com for the best prices.  I was happy that you carried this product.</li>
    <li> Based on some of the mixed reviews, I wasn&#x27;t so sure how I&#x27;d feel about this product. BUT it just came today and I absolutely LOVE it. First off, the packaging looks and feels a lot nicer than I anticipated. All the powders are gorgeous and silky (NOT chalky at all, which I often worry about with cheaper makeup), and the color choices are great for a wide variety of looks. There is also a generous amount of each product, so it will last you a while. The little applicators are worthless, of course, but that&#x27;s no news to anyone. This would be especially fabulous for traveling over a more extended period of time. It&#x27;s got everything!  This is a GREAT deal for us ladies on budgets.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a makeup kit that had bright, not common eyeshadow colors and this was the one i liked the best. Regulary for eyeshadows NYX is my brand of preference and this Makeup kit was no disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;The size is great for traveling and the blushes and bronzers are really pretty. The eyeshadows are very pigmented and come in a very good size. The only cons I found were most of the lip glosses don&#x27;t really suit me, and the applicators are useless. Other than that I will recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have bought a few single eye shadows from nyx and been happy w color payoff. And although the packaging was great and everything came fast and intact. The payoff didn&#x27;t seem the same as single authentic nyx shadows. So I was left wondering is it authentic nyx eyeshadows bc I had to wet my brushes in order to get it looking like the color front of me. Also, some colors in pictures don&#x27;t really look the same as thy did in person. Which is important for someone who does makeup. But the price was great for the amount you get. I would say only a few colors were True to color once wet. So I will be using a few that I have fallen in love with. Others will probably just stay in the pallet untouched.  I would still say nyx is a great company but make sure it is authentic. Also one of the shimmery bronzers was really beautiful on.</li>
    <li> I gave this product a three star rating because for 2 reasons. I fell in love with this palette as soon as I saw it. However I found it on the nyx cosmetics website and was a little dismayed that the colors on the nyx site are much more lovely than those I see here. Maybe its poor lighting or a bad quality camera. I&#x27;m not sure but I gave the product some hope and ordered it. I&#x27;ll see when it arrives. Here&#x27;s the link to the nyx site to see the difference for yourself. [...]</li>
    <li> I was in need of some new eyeshadows and came across this palette on amazon and it had everything I wanted and then some, plus the price was great so I decided to order it. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this kit. The makeup has great pigment and lasts all day. There are so many colors that I can wear bright and bold looks, smokey looks, and natural looks. The kit arrived in perfect condition with nothing broken which was a relief since I read so many reviews with people recieving a damaged kit. The only part of the kit I don&#x27;t use are the brushes. The lip gloss brush was pretty hard but luckily I have a makeup brush kit so I can get over that.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using nyx cosmetics, and I am very pleases. The eye shadows go on very easily, and they blend, nicely, the blush and lip colors are just right, not too dark, I would recommended this product, my only complaint would be, the company should package it better, I had two eyeshadows that were broken, but still love this pallette.</li>
    <li> I love this pallet. The only thing that was wrong with it was I had a cracked Mirror when I opened it. Otherwise wonderful great product &amp; it is very pigmented</li>
    <li> Love the colors in the palette.   Where this product is a major FAIL is in the poor packaging.  I received it  with broken eyeshadows which ruined everything.   Judging from the other bad reviews with similar problems to mine my advice is that if you really want this kit buy it directly from the NYX site itself or some other beauty site like cherry culture.  I&#x27;m very disappointed about the way I received my package and the only reason I bought it on here was as opposed to elsewhere was due to a $5 amazon coupon.</li>
    <li> The quality of this product FAR exceeded my expectations!  It arrived well before I expected it, it was wrapped and packaged beautifully, it was in perfect condition when I received it (thank you, Flossy!!!), and it looks like professional makeup kits I&#x27;ve used in the past.  So many choices, and the colors blend very well --- perfect if you like the bright colors, and still perfect if you want to tone down some of the brights by blending with more neutral colors.  Since it has EVERYTHING, I&#x27;ll be taking this whenever/wherever I travel, and I&#x27;ll be giving it as gifts to my girlfriends! The seller (Flossy) offers great products at amazing prices, so I&#x27;ll be back soon for more goodies.</li>
    <li> Kind of upset that it was a bit broken but the make up was great quality and good condition :)</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PALETTE! THE ONLY BAD THING I CAN SAY IS THAT THE PACKAGING WAS HORRIBLE. WHEN I RECIEVED MY FIRST ONE THE ENTIRE BLUSH-BRONZER PART WAS SHATTERED INTO PIECES. I WAS ANNOYED BUT WHEN I CALLED AMAZON THEY SENT ME ONE FOR FREE! THE SECOND ONE WAS DEF IN BETTER SHAPE.SO HERE I AM AGAIN ORDERING MY THIRD ONE!! THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A GREAT BIRTHDAY GIFT FOR A FABULOUS FRIEND!! I RECOMMEND THIS FOR ANY GIRL WHO LOVES TO GET DOLLED UP OR FOR A PROFESSIONAL ON THE GO! ENJOY!! XXXXX</li>
    <li> Do not buy this product! It arrived damaged due to poor packaging, and now Amazon says it is an item not eligible for return. You will simply throw your money away if you purchase this.</li>
    <li> I love this makeup kit! I was worried when I first decided to get it because I had heard that the shadows sometimes get broken during shipment but I got mine as a gift and it was compleatly taken care of and protected by a few different things. None of the shadows where broken and they all work amazingly. I love all the colors and how well they go on and stay on. Of your looking for a makeup kit I would recoment this one for sure.</li>
    <li> I received my NYX kit today. Unfortunately due to packaging one of the eye shadows broke and ended up ruining all the other colors. So now I have to return it and wait for another kit to come. I was so excited, now I&#x27;m a little leery. I&#x27;m going to give it another try. Please don&#x27;t let me down Amazon.</li>
    <li> amazing colors I really love it ,, it look like the photo .. it&#x27;s perfect set the colors not too much glittery but shining give the eyes great natural look &amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I use every product. Beautiful! Colors need to be patted on for depth, but love the contents. I do recommend</li>
    <li> The product was nice but not great! it came banged up a bit so that broke apart one of the colors which created a mess all over the product and the case it is in. The colors aren&#x27;t as vibrant as they appeared in the photo. I really needed a black black, and the black they have in it is more a black gray. Thankfully I am an MakeUp Artist and can make do with this but refer back to other product I have. *I wasn&#x27;t blown away by this, but its ok.*</li>
    <li> This makeup is beautiful, I love the whole kit, the eyeshadows have great pigmentation, I also love the blushes and the bronzers, since are very good quality. I was very pleased with this buy.</li>
    <li> Love it every color you&#x27;ll every need is in this kit and at a great price - I need to reorder</li>
    <li> I just received my order today. If it wasn&#x27;t for nearly all of my eyeshadows being crushed it probably would have been a great buy. There was crushed eyeshadow over the entire container. It was even mixed into the lipsticks... The container itself is pretty sturdy and the products (that weren&#x27;t damaged) look very bright and vibrant. I was really looking forward to receiving my package. I&#x27;m currently waiting on response from seller for a replacement/refund..........</li>
    <li> Let me just first thank Misspinkcat and Amazon for their exceptional product, packaging, and customer service! Over the past five years, I have spent over $10,000 on beauty products, $7,000 on make-up alone. I have purchased beauty products from almost every retailer out there and tried a versatile selection of brand name products. I guess you can say that I am a beauty queen who takes her make-up very seriously. I consider myself a pro when it comes to applying make-up, so no false advertisement here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, my husband wanted to purchase a Valentine&#x27;s Day gift for me and I knew exactly what I needed. I was looking for a complete make-up kit with the works (bright colors, product quality, price, &amp; versatility). I had researched for hours, coming across pricey and monotonous kits, until I discovered the NYX eyeshadow, lipstick, and glitter shade kits. (Now, I have used NYX products before, they have always been fav, but I never invested in complete kits like these.)  So after reading the reviews and deciding to make a $150.00 investment with standard shipping (35 eyeshadow kit, 36 lipgloss kit, 78 eyeshadow kit, &amp; 40 eyeshadow glitter) I was excited, but nervous because of the reviews I had read about shattered eyeshadows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After waiting only four days, I received my shipment. As I carefully opened the box, I said to myself \\&quot;here we go; I really hope I don&#x27;t have to make a return due to a lemon product.\\&quot; Once the box was open, I noticed that everything was neatly placed and wrapped in bubble wrap; I was relieved and grateful all at the same time.  Now when people refer to these products as \\&quot;crack\\&quot; or \\&quot;magic dust,\\&quot; they&#x27;re not kidding.  Once I tried every color, lipgloss, bronzer, powder, and glitter dust I knew I had made a life-time investment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RESULTS:&lt;br /&gt;35 pc. Eyeshadow Kit: Amazing! Glides on perfect, with a variety of colors, and last all day! Good Beginner kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;78 pc. Eyeshadow Kit: Dress-up or dress down, this kitwill offer you everything you need for eyes and cheeks. Can be used for work or play!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;40 pc. Glitter Eyeshadow:  Perfect for the glam girl! Love glitter, just can&#x27;t get enough of it? Then this is a must, believe me it will be one of the best purchases you will ever make! Added Bonus: Make-up brush (too big for bottles, but is great for applying concealer or other shadows).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;36 pc. Lipgloss Kit: I especially like that these lipglosses are fragrance free because they never feel sticky, always make my lips feel smooth and shiny. Plus, great colors and will last forever! Perfect for gifts as well. Added Bonus: Free Lipgloss Bag!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I&#x27;m hooked now, saving a fortune and continue to be impressed with the quality and versatility of these products, the kits are as big as they look don&#x27;t be fooled! I&#x27;m so happy with my purchase that I would recommend this to anyone who wants to look fabulous.</li>
    <li> I ordered this feeling scared because I saw some of the pics of destroyed and busted eyeshadows. I&#x27;m sorry for anyone who received those but mine came in flawless!!! Perfectly all together just amazing!!!!&lt;br /&gt;The make up itself is amazing as well!! Loving the colors and all it has to offer</li>
    <li> i really liked this i love the eyeshadows and the bronzers and the lip color i was not really expacting the lip colors to be good but i feel in love with them and the packing was good you can do a lot with the eyeshadows and the bronzers are nice cuz they give you differne once to work with so if you dont like one of them you can pick a differnt one so its</li>
    <li> The eyeshadow colors are dull. Not enough brightness even with the Eye Base and primer added. However, I do like the blush colors and lipgloss. I just wish the eyeshadows were much brighter. So many colors with out the brightness. What a waste.</li>
    <li> Just bought this for my wife, and she loved it. Many colors, options and good quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> All the colors are great! I use it everyday, my girlfriends are all jealous I got it at such a bargain, usually its worth 50 bucks at ulta! For sure gonna keep watching for deals!</li>
    <li> This palette is sooo much fun. The eye shadows are pretty good quality and came in a much larger size then I expected. The bronzers and blushes are awesome! So many choices with a look for any time of the day. You can definitely experiment and have a ton of fun with this thing. NYX products are by far my favorite products and half the price of high end makeup, yet comparable to a lot of the higher end makeup brands. I like the bronzers in this palette better than Urban Decay bronzers. The blush options are great as well, very pigmented, so you don&#x27;t need a ton of it. I love, love, love this palette.</li>
    <li> Love this color pallet.. the eyeshadows rock, the blushers are great, I haven&#x27;t used the lip colors yet. But so far I am very pleased with this kit and use it every day!</li>
    <li> This is mostly a good palette.  Some of the eyeshadows are not very pigmented, but they build up nicely. The lip glosses are junk, they all go on quite sheer. Even the darker red toned ones (and I&#x27;m a pale toned person). The blushes and bronzer are nice-go on nicely and are pigmented. If your looking for a diverse palette but something not too crazy, this is a good buy. Most of the eyeshadow&#x27;s are everyday wearable, even the aquas. Give it a try, you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> Love it! The make up set was a lot better than I expected. I will buy more as they make great gifts.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic!!! I was little worried when I bought it because it was going to be an international delivery and it was the first time I had bought anything from N.Y.X! But boy I was so surprised when this arrived 10 days earlier than I expected! And all  eyeshadows, blushes, etc were in perfect condition! They are really pigmented and I&#x27;m more than happy with this purchase! And is a super deal for the price! A must buy if you want a quality makeup at a good price</li>
    <li> Great collection of excellent makeup</li>
    <li> Every year I buy me a Christmas gift. One way to make sure I get something I like. Upon receiving this in the mail. I bought another one as a gift, Quality product at a great price.</li>
    <li> Quality through and through.  Long lasting but cleans up easily when you want to take it off.  Everything you need in a make up kit.&lt;br /&gt;I used to be a professional make up artist - I spent a fortune on my products but I must say this came at a bargain price for the quality&lt;br /&gt;that rivals even the very best I used to carry with me on the job.</li>
    <li> I received this not so long ago. I love it! Here&#x27;s the deal....I live overseas. I have a PO Box and often items come to me damaged. I ordered this palette and was very worried after reading some of the reviews about broken sections. However, I am delighted to report that my kit came completely intake halfway around the world. Product quality: The shadows are wonderful. The color application matches the color in the pan, which is not always the case with inexpensive shadows. Application IS light BUT buildable. This is perfect for a beginner or someone who prefers a lighter more subtle look. For makeup artists, this is not an issue. We just continue to build until desired saturation is achieved. Plus, wetting the brush makes the colors apply more saturated as well. Blushes and bronzes are highly pigmented but still buildable and blendable. Brushes are not that great but that is to be expected. Glosses/lipsticks are moisturizing. Not as great as the individual ones sold by this brand. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Just perfect, great packaging, has all the colors for a pro MAKE UP! Was my best purchase in MAKE UP.</li>
    <li> Nice set of colors.  Use an eyeshadow primer and it should work nicely.  It&#x27;s a nice set for the price and a great way to have a little bit of everything on hand in one package.  I still prefer individual eyeshadows and blushes, but it&#x27;s worth having for the variety.</li>
    <li> I love nyx cosmetics this pallette is highly pigmented. Beautiful colors very multitaskable, u can blush, contour, hightlight and bronze your face. the only bad thing was my purple eyeshadow came broken but everything elae was find the brushes were real small so ull have to buy ur own.</li>
    <li> its a lovely set but i came a little damaged when it was shipped to me.... one of the palettes were destroyed</li>
    <li> I was a bit scared to order this because of the many comments and reviews saying theirs came damaged and/or broken. I took a chance because I adore this brand and ordered it anyway. I received mine in PERFECT condition with not a single speck of powder out of place. I was thrilled. And this product is surprising large and heavy, so if you&#x27;re hoping to take it along with you in your bag, you might want to reconsider. Because it&#x27;s so large you&#x27;re getting more product and that&#x27;s what really puts this product over the top!</li>
    <li> I love this cosmetic set so much. It has everything I need. A lot of eye shadow colours. I really really love it. Thank you NYX for such a good product :)</li>
    <li> This item arrived intact and in very good condition!.. I&#x27;m sure the preteen who is going to get it for Christmas.... will love it!!</li>
    <li> I am not big fan of this palette. I like many NYX products but this particular palette is no on of them. It is just OK palette.</li>
    <li> My kit arrived quickly but one of my eye shadows came broken so right away I returned it and asked for a new one and in 2 days I got a new one in perfect conditions. I did my make up to go to work at 6:30am went n worked for 8 hours n came back home n my make up was stil stunning! I got compliments from everyone now i did buy a primer to help it last longer! The reason i gave em 4 stars because many colors are similar. But over all is worth the buy! Once again thanks Amazon for ur great business! 😊</li>
    <li> This is thumbs up very good colors...all you need is there must have!!! i will get one for my sis!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of NYX makeup for years. This makeup kit is wonderful. The shades are beautiful, they mix well and they are long wear. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I was so Happy when I opened this up On Christmas!I had been asking for this from my husband for months! My only disappointing endeavor was that the mailman obviously paid no mind to the \\&quot;Handle with care\\&quot; label, because there were 4 broken shadows when i opened it!! &#x3D;( also... I think the brush and bronzers broke my lovely honey complected skin out, Other than that....Muy Bueno!! I use it DAILY and i get soooooo many compliments! I&#x27;ve even encouraged my mother to start wearing makeup...Oh dios mio!!! hahahaha!!!</li>
    <li> Perfect.  All colors, I use primer on my eyelids and colors last even longer. Love the bronzers too! I&#x27;m sure this palette wil last me a few years.</li>
    <li> I received the product tonight. It came completely damaged. I chose not to gift my wife with it because it was unusable.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, I use it all the time and it has not made me break out, which is nice!  Worth the money for sure.</li>
    <li> Got this as a gift for my mom, she loved it and so did I! Had to get one for me.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend for anyone</li>
    <li> I will explain my title in a moment.&lt;br /&gt;The colors in the kit are vivid and beautiful.  Kudos to NYX.&lt;br /&gt;However, I rated this low because when it arrived the case was broken, and some of the pans of eyeshadow were broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me, common sense would say never ship fragile items cross country in paper thin packaging. The kit was shipped in the thinnest package available, the only thing thinner than the shipping packing used would be toilet tissue.&lt;br /&gt;It was encased in bubble wrap, but so what, it was still stupidly shipped. Common sense would say get a cardboard box, encase the item in bubble wrap and ship it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NYX did what they were supposed to, if only the shipper had done what they were supposed to do, the experience would be so much better.</li>
    <li> The colors are beautiful, and with a primer, or white base under the eye shadows they are very pigmented. I am very pleased with how much product you get for the great price.</li>
    <li> I the kit I received from NYX IS NOT what was pictured on Amazon..AWFUL COLORS...1990s OLD..&lt;br /&gt;I would appreciate NYX refunding my money and issuing me a pre-paid return label...as this is not what I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;The colors of the eyeshadows ARE NOT anything like the PHOTO..&lt;br /&gt;NOT HAPPY with NYX</li>
    <li> This was just what I&#x27;ve been looking for!  I use it daily. The eye shadow palettes are filled with vibrant colors, I&#x27;m in love with the blushes &amp; bronzers, &amp; the lip pallete is nice as well!</li>
    <li> I bought this set for my daughter. She uses it everyday. It has every color you could ask for. Shadows last all day.</li>
    <li> lovely collection of makeup, especially the various eye shadows. great quality, I only gave it 4 stars because one of the eye shadows was missed up when it arrived and got all over the eye shadows area.</li>
    <li> Best purchase!! Love it! A lot of pigment! Will buy again!</li>
    <li> The colors were as vibrant as they appeared online; the package was shipped wonderfully packed and all arrived in tact. My teenager loved it.</li>
    <li> Colors are not pigmented, looks like an armature makeup artist kit. Perfect for someone in high school. Coastal scents has better pigmented shadows and blushes.</li>
    <li> When i received this product  the bottom row of lip glosses were stuck.  So when i tried to pull out the top row i could not doe so because the lip glosses were stuck underneath.</li>
    <li> i love love love this.. its very pigmented and although its nt a very wide variety of colours the quality its supurb</li>
    <li> love it sooooooooooooooooo much&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;excellent quality, still being used like new 2 years later, i would recommened this product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
    <li> Very nice variety of shades here :) I love this product and its results! Perfect starter gift for those starting their journey into really using makeup :D</li>
    <li> Great color options and wear. Great if you like shimmery eye shadows.</li>
    <li> It is good for a makeup student. Not a bad product at all. You can not get a better product for the price. However, I would like better selects for eye and lip colors</li>
