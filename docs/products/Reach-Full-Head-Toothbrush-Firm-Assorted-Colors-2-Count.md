      <li>They&#x27;re long-lasting, affordable, and have many great features like the ones I mentioned earlier.e first few times I had used it.</li>
      <li>received quickly and as described</li>
      <li>I like the firm tooth brushes but most stores carry the soft, so to have twin packs are great.</li>
      <li>My husband struggles to find toothbrushes that are firm -- it was great to get these online.  </li>
      <li>The firmness and &amp;#34;reach&amp;#34; is just right.</li>
      <li>It has to have good, firm bristles to get the job done right.</li>
      <li>Great toothbrush but hard to locate in stores.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;This may be more of a personal preference, but a toothbrush also has to have good, firm bristles.</li>
      <li>I only wish for more colors....</li>
      <li>I bought several - glad to find amazon still carries them.</li>
      <li>Nice rough brissels the way I like it.  </li>
      <li>They are exactly what he wanted.</li>
      <li>So first, thank you Amazon.</li>
      <li>: I can honestly say that I&#x27;ve broken more than one toothbrush in my mouth while brushing my teeth.</li>
      <li>The toothbrush also has to be an overall good length, which is surprisingly hard to find with most toothbrushes.</li>
      <li>The local shops don&#x27;t seem to carry them very often, so it&#x27;s super easy to order (and reorder) using my Prime account and know I&#x27;ll have new toothbrushes in two days.</li>
      <li>The whole family loves &amp;#34;Reach&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>and afterwards I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;ve cleaned my teeth very well.</li>
      <li>You really cant find these in the stores unless you go on a mission.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t get any bleeding with hard bristle, and they clean a lot better.</li>
      <li>Finally my teeth are really clean.  </li>
      <li>The Reach has very strong and firm bristles.</li>
      <li>Obviously, this was very surprising and frustrating.</li>
      <li>If I have soft bristles, it really doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m getting the job done very well when I&#x27;m brushing</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m always searching for a decent toothbrush</li>
      <li>However if you are carful not to thrash your gum line with the stiff bristles these do get your teeth clean quickly.</li>
      <li>it has the unique Reach shape that I love for getting behind my molars.</li>
      <li>These are my favorite toothbrushes and not readily available in stores.</li>
      <li>cant they make normal colors?</li>
      <li>Never tried a firm toothbrush before, glad I did.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Something else that seems more and more common these days with toothbrushes is that manufacturers are making the overall length too short.</li>

      <li>One thing I&#x27;m particular about are hygiene, specifically dental hygiene, which is why I use the Reach Advanced Design Toothbrush with firm bristles.</li>
      <li>While the size can be considered \\&quot;full\\&quot;, the bristles are not firm.  </li>
      <li>soft or medium makes me want</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t understand why everything is soft bristle.</li>
      <li>They are not firm.</li>
      <li>It takes me 3 times longer to brush my teeth with a soft brush.</li>
      <li>The Reach Advanced Design Toothbrush is plenty long enough even to get the back of your mouth in hard-to-reach areas like the molars.</li>

      <li>I wanted a firm toothbrush with a FULL SIZED HEAD.</li>
      <li>We like this firm full brushes.</li>
      <li>Take a little getting used too, but well worth it.</li>
      <li>With some toothbrushes, you barely have anything to hold on to while you brush your teeth.</li>
      <li>If not careful, scrapes the roof of your mouth</li>
      <li>With some toothbrushes, you barely have anything to hold on to while you brush your teeth.</li>
      <li>The toothbrush that this happened with wasn&#x27;t even very old and had only been within the first few times I had used it.</li>
      <li>This is the right size and it&#x27;s firm.</li>
      <li>They clean a lot better than the stupid, overpriced soft brushes my family has been using.</li>
      <li>I have always liked using firm, or hard toothbrushes.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> looked everywhere in stores could not find a hard toothbrush where i live looked for six months hope they keep selling there here Tom</li>
    <li> Never tried a firm toothbrush before, glad I did. They clean a lot better than the stupid, overpriced soft brushes my family has been using. Buying these from now on!</li>
    <li> not my favorite toothbrush of all time or anything like that. It works fine and I can get it on scheduled delivery so I am happy.</li>
    <li> I ordered these as a \\&quot;firm\\&quot; bristle.  They are not firm. I wouldn&#x27;t even call them a medium.  they were soft and did not clean my teeth and gums as well as other firm brushes I have used. very very disappointed. and i will not buy them again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just what I wantec. I like them alot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am use to firm tooth brush bristles.&lt;br /&gt;The soft or medium makes me want&lt;br /&gt;to gag.</li>
    <li> You really cant find these in the stores unless you go on a mission. The firm brush is the best and feels great on my teeth. I wont use any other toothbrush.</li>
    <li> The bristles of this toothbrush are bunched together in small clusters.  This has the effect of making the bristles act as a unit and lessens the effectiveness and firmness of the toothbrush.  While the size can be considered \\&quot;full\\&quot;, the bristles are not firm.  I will not buy another one of these.  Disappointing.</li>
    <li> received quickly and as described</li>
    <li> I like the firm tooth brushes but most stores carry the soft, so to have twin packs are great. I stocked up on them. Thank you Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> Good purchase.  All things worked well.  A tooth brush is a tooth brush unless it is soft (like almost all are today) and then it is a tooth brush that does not clean well.  I found what I was looking for... good product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so difficult to find hard toothbrushes in the U.S. now.  The only place I knew they were still was in Canada.  I&#x27;m so happy to find them on here.</li>
    <li> Good product. Almost impossible to find Firm Heads at retail. Maybe impossible. I brush maybe once/da on average, I find this lasts a year. Don&#x27;t understand why everything is soft bristle. I&#x27;m 83 and I don&#x27;t get any bleeding with hard bristle, and they clean a lot better.</li>
    <li> I have always liked using firm, or hard toothbrushes.  I know that dentistry today recommends using softer ones.  However, I have every tooth, except the wisdom ones.  I seldom need cleanings because the firm brushes keep my teeth so tartar free.  I looked everywhere in local stores and no one carried the firm ones.  Out of desperation I looked online and found them on the Reach site.  My teeth are so clean, and tartar free.  And my dentist says my gums are exceptional.  I will never be satisfied with softer ones.</li>
    <li> I really liked good products excellent</li>
    <li> good product have used for years</li>
    <li> Nice rough brissels the way I like it.  They last for a long time.  I have to regrets buying this product.</li>
    <li> not bad, but suppose to be little harder :/</li>
    <li> I had gotten discouraged at the prospect of ever finding a firm toothbrush since they seem unavailable in stores. I can&#x27;t express how happy I was to find this online. So first, thank you Amazon. Second, it was everything I had hoped for. Firm enough to work well, yet not so hard that it hurt my gums. Added bonus it has the unique Reach shape that I love for getting behind my molars. If you like firm bristles this is a winner!</li>
    <li> Why is it so difficult to buy hard toothbrushes here? These are great and do a much better job of cleaning than the soft or medium ones. Good toothbrushes and you want a firmer brush, then these are the ones you need.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get these for teeth,I got them for cleaning hard to reach spots in the kitchen..  You know,plastic lids,fork tines,such..</li>
    <li> The dentist don&#x27;t want you to use a firm brush cause they actually clean your teeth.  Finally my teeth are really clean.  These firm brushes are the only ones to use.  Very very hard to find in the stores.  I bought several - glad to find amazon still carries them.</li>
    <li> Amazon makes it easy to get the firm toothbrushes I want at a great price. The local shops don&#x27;t seem to carry them very often, so it&#x27;s super easy to order (and reorder) using my Prime account and know I&#x27;ll have new toothbrushes in two days.</li>
    <li> Still the best toothbrush I can find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New changes include bi-color bristles for wear tracking.  Minus one star for the &amp;#34;REACH&amp;#34; embossed logo on the backside of the brush head.  If not careful, scrapes the roof of your mouth and/or inside of cheeks. Could do without the embossed logo!</li>
    <li> We like this firm full brushes. The whole family loves &amp;#34;Reach&amp;#34;. Good price, and I love the scheduled deliveries, as they also remind me to change the brushes on time. I only wish for more colors....</li>
    <li> One thing I&#x27;m particular about are hygiene, specifically dental hygiene, which is why I use the Reach Advanced Design Toothbrush with firm bristles. Call me crazy, but I&#x27;ve always been picky about the toothbrush I use, and with reason. I&#x27;m always searching for a decent toothbrush and I think I&#x27;ve finally found a reliable one. There are a few things I expect out of a toothbrush. It has to be durable for one, because I do brush my teeth more hard than average. It has to have good, firm bristles to get the job done right. The toothbrush also has to be an overall good length, which is surprisingly hard to find with most toothbrushes. The Reach Advanced Design Toothbrush has all three of these qualities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush I use has to be durable and able to withstand about a month&#x27;s use. I mentioned early that I brush my teeth rather hard and to demonstrate what I mean by this, I&#x27;ll give you an example: I can honestly say that I&#x27;ve broken more than one toothbrush in my mouth while brushing my teeth. Other brands have not stood up to such a test that I give them. If this hasn&#x27;t happened to you, take it from me, it&#x27;s a very unpleasant feeling having a toothbrush snap in two and then inadvertently stab yourself in the gums without the head on it. As hard as I brush my teeth and as long as I have used the Reach, I haven&#x27;t broken one single toothbrush yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may be more of a personal preference, but a toothbrush also has to have good, firm bristles. If I have soft bristles, it really doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m getting the job done very well when I&#x27;m brushing and afterwards I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;ve cleaned my teeth very well. The Reach has very strong and firm bristles. Also, another issue I&#x27;ve had in the past is that I&#x27;ve actually had a toothbrush in the past that as I was using it, all the bristles fell out into my mouth. Obviously, this was very surprising and frustrating. The toothbrush that this happened with wasn&#x27;t even very old and had only been within the first few times I had used it. Fortunately, I&#x27;ve never encountered this problem with the Reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something else that seems more and more common these days with toothbrushes is that manufacturers are making the overall length too short. With some toothbrushes, you barely have anything to hold on to while you brush your teeth. Well, this is one thing that rings true with the Reach and probably the reason for its namesake. The Reach Advanced Design Toothbrush is plenty long enough even to get the back of your mouth in hard-to-reach areas like the molars. I&#x27;m not sure why more manufacturers are skimping on the length of toothbrushes. Humans aren&#x27;t getting any smaller. My guess is that it&#x27;s out of be economical, but I call it being cheap. Like many of its qualities, this too, is an area where Reach didn&#x27;t skimp. The length of the toothbrush is sufficient to easily reach my back molars without having to put half of my hand in my mouth like some other brands of toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What more could you ask for in a toothbrush than the qualities I have mentioned with the Reach Advanced Design Toothbrush? I&#x27;d recommend this toothbrush to anyone. They&#x27;re long-lasting, affordable, and have many great features like the ones I mentioned earlier.e first few times I had used it.

    <li> You can&#x27;t buy hard brushes anywhere I know of at stores...I&#x27;ve looked for years and of course Amazon has everything. I feel my gums coming back to life. I know lots of people who don&#x27;t believe in them but I still love them.</li>
    <li> For two years Ive been using the hardest bristle brush I could find. That would be med because you cant find firm/hard in any store, even walmart.  I had almost forgot how real clean teeth feel.&lt;br /&gt;Whats up with that?  I mean why did they take away my firm brushes?  If you say because its not good for your teeth I say, its not good for dentists because my teeth are way cleaner than the soft or med.  Whats this world coming to.  ADA conspiracy. Not only that but they last 10x longer.  And there good for the gums and tongue.  They get under the gums better and inbetween the teeth better? Not for panzies though because they definately are harder.  Take a little getting used too, but well worth it.</li>
    <li> I had been using this brand  of tooth brush for a year now and it works great! Will be using it for many years to come unless a better invention comes to the market.</li>
    <li> My husband struggles to find toothbrushes that are firm -- it was great to get these online.  They are exactly what he wanted.</li>
    <li> These seem softer out of the box than the crystal firm reach toothbrushes i ordered last time. actually these feel like the crystal ones after a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i like that these have the tongue scrapers on the back, thats new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;why cant they make normal colors? why cant they make an all white or all black or grey or blue. why must toothbrushes have neon and feminine colors?</li>
    <li> These are my favorite toothbrushes and not readily available in stores. My dental hygienist hands out free toothbrushes to me but I&#x27;d rather use these since the head is larger.</li>
    <li> I searched and searched locally for someone who had firm/hard bristle toothbrushes in my area and could find none. I think the Dental organizations have leaned on the manufacturers to stop selling them. Yes if miss-used they can lead to receding gums. However if you are carful not to thrash your gum line with the stiff bristles these do get your teeth clean quickly. It takes me 3 times longer to brush my teeth with a soft brush. Glad to see that Amazon has not caved in to pressure to not offer them...</li>
    <li> Quality!!  That is not available in my area.  So glad to be able to order them from home.  Thank you for making them available and easy to pruchase.  These are a toothbrush that is made to do a really good job.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush but hard to locate in stores.  This is the only toothbrush my husband will use.  The firmness and &amp;#34;reach&amp;#34; is just right.</li>
    <li> This is truly a FULL HEAD toothbrush. I previously bought a box of Oral-B Complete Advantage toothbrushes. The head on those are very small. Great for a child I guess, but I hated them. I wanted a firm toothbrush with a FULL SIZED HEAD. This is the right size and it&#x27;s firm. Great for the price.</li>
    <li> Hard to find a FIRM head!  I buy 4 of these at the beginning of every year.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush at a good price</li>
