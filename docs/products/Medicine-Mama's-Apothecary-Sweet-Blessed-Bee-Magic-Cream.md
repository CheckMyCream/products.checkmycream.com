      <li>The more I use it, the better my skin looks and feels.  </li>
      <li>Well, as much as it does NOT work for me, it works great for my husband.</li>
      <li>That was the clincher for me, between purchasing this or the Egyptian Magic All Purpose Skin Cream.  </li>
      <li>The fact that it&#x27;s organic makes it way better than Egyptian Magic, and the consistency is nicer too.  </li>

      <li>Love that it&#x27;s organic and love the price.  </li>
      <li>but it sure worked on my hair.........</li>
      <li>Also it&#x27;s safe to put on my lips, so I use it as chapstick sometimes.</li>
      <li>But this product is SO much more.</li>
      <li>Love all of the Medicine Mama&#x27;s products.</li>
      <li>Excellent for dry cuticles, feet, or wherever your skin needs hydrating.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve ordered and re-ordered Sweet Bee skin cream many times, in fact I&#x27;m ordering two more jars today.  </li>
      <li>It is also so great for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>It has many uses and is well worth the price!  </li>
      <li>It is easy to tell there are no added fragrances.</li>
      <li>This was shipped very quickly and arrived packaged wonderfully~&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It goes on easily</li>
      <li>It has full healing properties in my experience!&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful product that I&#x27;m so glad that I purchased.</li>
      <li>First of all it is nice to see the honey is used in this product.</li>
      <li>I always wake up with smooth, hydrated skin.</li>
      <li>Another great perk I&#x27;ve noticed is that smaller pimples will disappear overnight.</li>
      <li>and *Bazinga* smooth, moisturized tootsies.  </li>
      <li>Basically it does make my skin look better, but not so much so that it&#x27;s some kind of miracle cream, or worth the greasy feeling</li>
      <li>I ordered the smaller jar since it was cheaper than Egyptian Magic, and the reviews said it was a good alternative.</li>
      <li>When I got the jar, the first thing I noticed was the smell was off, not like Egyptian Magic.</li>
      <li>It works great for my cuticles which are now no longer dry and ragged.</li>
      <li>When using just as a moisturizer I apply heavier for full treatment.</li>
      <li>well what do you know, I&#x27;m not kidding, the magic worked on my hair, the falling out literally stopped, I would comb and comb and nothing, really,  </li>
      <li>Overnight any blemish of any kind in that area is either completely healed or is almost healed.  </li>
      <li>forgot to add that I also received a free sample of the VMagic and also a smaller sample of Sweet Bee Magic Skin Cream, which I just take along with me</li>
      <li>It has the exact same ingredients as the Egyptian Magic Cream (which I have never tried), and based on all the great reviews of EMC, I thought maybe this can do something similar.</li>
      <li>This cream has given me no bad reaction whatsoever as it is only really good natural chemical free</li>
      <li>Warm it up in your hands and use it anywhere on your body, especially face, neck and hands.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d rather pay more and get an all natural product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a useful, multi-purpose cream to have around.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It is also great for scrapes, bites, small sores, etc.</li>
      <li>On the contrary, this stuff stays on my face all night, and I can still feel it on certain areas (that don&#x27;t touch the pillow) in the morning!   </li>
      <li>Sweet Bee Magic is made using a chemical process, and so even though the ingredients are natural, the product isn&#x27;t actually a naturally made product.</li>
      <li>I even had some rough callous on my heels and this Sweet Bee Magic has softened them out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Just don&#x27;t leave it in your car on a hot day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>As soon as I hope out of the shower, I put this on my face as a moisturizer, it doesn&#x27;t take too much, and it melts into my skin, just like that!  </li>
      <li>Can also be used to seal in your favorite skin cream than doesn&#x27;t moisturize enough in the winter.</li>
      <li>Absolutely UH-MAZING product!</li>
      <li>My favorite use is as a lip balm (which would last years in this size) &amp; as a balm for cracked heels.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s really thick, more like petroleum jelly, where SB is softer and easy to spread!</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve found that this product is great to have on hand for minor scrapes, burns, and skin irritation, and it&#x27;s been very moisturizing for my dry spots (feet, cuticles, elbows, etc.).</li>
      <li>Large container.</li>
      <li>I was certain</li>
      <li>This balm is very healing.</li>
      <li>My complexion has really improved.  </li>
      <li>So lips &amp; cuticles, really, is what I&#x27;m using it for.</li>
      <li>really recommend.</li>
      <li>It has also helped with some of my more recent scarring; however, it hasn&#x27;t really done much for the old, persnickity spots yet.</li>
      <li>20 minutes later, I noticed his skin had completely absorbed it!</li>
      <li>and I have a tendency to react to many other moisturizers that have any sort of chemical in them.</li>
      <li>I purchased this product thinking it would be useful as an all-around healing skin cream, and (more particularly) hoping that it would help diminish past acne scars I have on my neck and chin</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used on my face (sensitive, dry-ish skin, with bouts of rosacea) &amp; it&#x27;s oK in a pinch, but even the thinnest layer takes forever to absorb, remaining sticky a long time.</li>
      <li>So overall, I have a meeh-so-so experience with this cream (it at least has not broken me out or anything), whereas my husband is getting great results.</li>
      <li>The mornings after using this product, I DON&#x27;T wake up with smooth or soft skin, neither has it really helped my winter dry skin.   </li>
      <li>I think I&#x27;ll try some other similar creams first, but I wouldn&#x27;t mind buying this again, as it hydrates my skin better that normal drugstore creams.</li>
      <li>This product made me really nervous because it looks like greasy, balmy, oily concoction.  </li>
      <li>My acne has gotten much better and the dry patches are totally gone.</li>
      <li>For me personally, this product really doesn&#x27;t do anything much.</li>
      <li>But with this Sweet Bee Magic--noooooo dry feet!  </li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>Anyway, that same sticky problem is exactly what makes this product work for healing my skiin, so I will keep purchasing it for that reason.</li>
      <li>I was worried that the skin cream would clog my pores, as it&#x27;s pretty oily (and my skin freaks out at the slightest provocation) but it actually seems to be improving the tone and texture of my skin.  </li>
      <li>will use it consistently and give any update latter on.</li>
      <li>I usually do not notice the itchy feeling until 8 hours after working.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is a little greasy when you first put it on, but after rubbing it in for a few seconds it leaves a nice moisturizing dewiness.  </li>
      <li>I rub a little bit between my hands and smooth onto my face.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a nice, thick sloppy moisturizer for those times when nothing else seems to work. It&#x27;s got a consistency similar to petroleum jelly, for those who are wondering. The smell is great (it smells like olive oil and beeswax) and it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers have mentioned absorption issues, and I have the same problem. If I apply this on my skin in the morning, it will still feel tacky at the end of the day. You can imagine the lint and debris that get stuck to my skin throughout the day as a result. Don&#x27;t let cats rub up against your legs, because they will leave a &amp;#34;fur swipe&amp;#34; where this moisturizer is, lol. Anyway, that same sticky problem is exactly what makes this product work for healing my skiin, so I will keep purchasing it for that reason.</li>
    <li> Still not sure if it is something I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Apparently, I&#x27;ve had dehydrated skin for quite some time (acne combined with dry, flaky patches and a tight feeling after just splashing with water) but just didn&#x27;t know. This stuff has totally helped me re-hydrate my skin! My acne has gotten much better and the dry patches are totally gone. Another great perk I&#x27;ve noticed is that smaller pimples will disappear overnight. There one day and gone the next. A little bit of this stuff goes a long way, too! Totally glad to have an organic miracle product. :)</li>
    <li> I just had to post a review for this product.  I rub a little bit between my hands and smooth onto my face.  My skin drinks it in after a bit.  I keep touching my cheeks and I&#x27;ve had this for a while.  Does not make me break out and protects my skin from winter chill/heater dehydration and those crackly lines that come with it.  Can also be used to seal in your favorite skin cream than doesn&#x27;t moisturize enough in the winter. Love that it&#x27;s organic and love the price.  A little goes a long way so this is a great buy.</li>
    <li> Excellent for dry cuticles, feet, or wherever your skin needs hydrating.  Love it in the winter on chapped lips. This balm is very healing.</li>
    <li> This product made me really nervous because it looks like greasy, balmy, oily concoction.  I was certain i would slather it on my face and wake up completely broken out.  But the reviews I read were so good and my skin was going through a horrible dry/peeling phase, so I tried it.  I have no explanation for what this product does!  Not only was my face not broken out at all, it felt so moisturized, it was incredible.  The more I use it, the better my skin looks and feels.  My complexion has really improved.  I&#x27;m not sure how this products works with all skin types, but for my combo skin (oily t-zone and really dry everywhere else) it worked amazingly.  I&#x27;m convinced!</li>
    <li> I ordered the smaller jar since it was cheaper than Egyptian Magic, and the reviews said it was a good alternative. I&#x27;ve been using EMC for years, and I was very happy to find a cheaper version. Well, i guess you get what you pay for. When I got the jar, the first thing I noticed was the smell was off, not like Egyptian Magic. Also the texture is slimy and chemically, not the soft oil I was expecting. I have very sensitive skin so I was a little worried and did some research online. Sweet Bee Magic is made using a chemical process, and so even though the ingredients are natural, the product isn&#x27;t actually a naturally made product. So frustrating! It&#x27;s so hard to get all-natural products! Needless to say, I returned my jar and purchased Egyptian Magic again. I&#x27;d rather pay more and get an all natural product.</li>
    <li> Too oily for me, will not order again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered and re-ordered Sweet Bee skin cream many times, in fact I&#x27;m ordering two more jars today.  Everyone in my family uses it.  My son who suffers with rough red patches on his skin uses this and it clears right up.  I use it on my face both morning and night and it&#x27;s also something we use when we get a scratch or burn to aid in healing.  I love the way it feels on my skin after showering.  A little goes a long way, a jar lasts me months before I need to re-order.  The fact that it&#x27;s organic makes it way better than Egyptian Magic, and the consistency is nicer too.  I&#x27;ve used EM and it&#x27;s really thick, more like petroleum jelly, where SB is softer and easy to spread!</li>
    <li> I tried this as a &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; substitute to Egyptian Magic it has the same ingredients but the consistency was different.  It seemed a bit greasier and didn&#x27;t soak in as well.</li>
    <li> I bought this product hoping it would help my acne and acne scars. It made my acne worse. It&#x27;s like putting petroleum jelly on your face. I&#x27;m still trying to get my acne back under control after using this crap. DO NOT BUY FOR ACNE!</li>
    <li> This stuff is a miracle worker!  I get acne breakouts due to hormonal issues, and nothing seems to work well for them...except this stuff!  I also sleep under a running a/c vent each night, and never realized just how bad that dried my skin out until I started using this product.  I put a pea size amount on my face and neck each night, and also my arms.  Overnight any blemish of any kind in that area is either completely healed or is almost healed.  It truly is amazing.  My face is also much more bright in complexion than before.&lt;br /&gt;It is a little greasy when you first put it on, but after rubbing it in for a few seconds it leaves a nice moisturizing dewiness.  It doesn&#x27;t leave grease or marks on the pillow cases, and sinks in fully over night.</li>
    <li> For me personally, this product really doesn&#x27;t do anything much. It has the exact same ingredients as the Egyptian Magic Cream (which I have never tried), and based on all the great reviews of EMC, I thought maybe this can do something similar. The mornings after using this product, I DON&#x27;T wake up with smooth or soft skin, neither has it really helped my winter dry skin.   So why would I give this product a 4 stars? Well, as much as it does NOT work for me, it works great for my husband. He has flaky dry patches of skin in the winter and recently has these dry red bumps that looks like eczema (which he thought were pimples and were using salicylic acid on them) on his cheeks. One night, I decided to try this Bee Magic on his problem areas, and the next day, I noticed the red bumps and dry patches were almost gone, and no more flakey skin! I&#x27;ve only used this thing twice on his face, and the bumps are now completely gone, and his skin is back to normal. Another difference with this product between me and him is that his skin literally drinks up this stuff. I put enough on his face so that it looks really oily, and no joke, 20 minutes later, I noticed his skin had completely absorbed it! On the contrary, this stuff stays on my face all night, and I can still feel it on certain areas (that don&#x27;t touch the pillow) in the morning!   So overall, I have a meeh-so-so experience with this cream (it at least has not broken me out or anything), whereas my husband is getting great results. I will probable repurchase this- but just for him.</li>
    <li> First of all it is nice to see the honey is used in this product. Something natural. I use it after shaving so the next day my skin does not break out from my clothing when my facial hair is growing back it. It does not stop it from happening but it does help it and less break out. It also helps slow that down during long shifts after work. I usually do not notice the itchy feeling until 8 hours after working. Also great for cuts and wounds.</li>
    <li> This stuff is a bit of magic in a jar! I had gotten this product to use as a cuticle cream of sorts. It works great for my cuticles which are now no longer dry and ragged. But this product is SO much more. I use it to seal in my nightly facial treatments. I apply a tiny amount under my eyes under my morning sunscreen and makeup to moisturize that area.  It is easy to tell there are no added fragrances. The scent takes a little getting used to, but once you do it is actually sort of neutral. This one is definitely a keeper. I will order again and again.</li>
    <li> I keep this at work for the winter months when lotion just won&#x27;t do. And for paper urs or any other booboos. Great ointment.</li>
    <li> Oily, but works well on skin.  Keep hair back or do before you shower.  Works great on feet and face.  Large container.</li>
    <li> Love all of the Medicine Mama&#x27;s products. I keep this by my bed for lips, feet, elbows and hands. Right after the shower and just before bed - great cure for winter feet!</li>
    <li> I use this product as a night cream and for my hands. If I am to be indoors all-day, I use it as my daytime moisturizer. It goes on easily &amp; I recommend it for anyone with dry skin.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!  2 ounces doesn&#x27;t sound like a lot, but it is!!!  I have peeling around and in the crease near my nose, so I needed something that wouldn&#x27;t dry me out.  This stuff is perfect!  As soon as I hope out of the shower, I put this on my face as a moisturizer, it doesn&#x27;t take too much, and it melts into my skin, just like that!  I also use this at night before I go to bed and when I wake up in the morning, you can&#x27;t tell that I slept with it.  I use this for bugbites, and slight burns, and also on my chapped lips.  I also use it on my boyfriend&#x27;s shaving nicks and scrapes.  I also had him using it after he got his tattoo, after he forgot to put ointment on it.  It has many uses and is well worth the price!  I also appreciate that it is Certified Organic.  That was the clincher for me, between purchasing this or the Egyptian Magic All Purpose Skin Cream.  Just don&#x27;t leave it in your car on a hot day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:&lt;br /&gt;I forgot to add that I also received a free sample of the VMagic and also a smaller sample of Sweet Bee Magic Skin Cream, which I just take along with me so I always have some on hand.</li>
    <li> Based on the reviews and the product name, I was lead to believe that this was a skin cream. It is NOT!  It is of a petroleum based consistency and quite greasy. I also do not care for the oily smell.</li>
    <li> I use this at night before bed. Warm it up in your hands and use it anywhere on your body, especially face, neck and hands. Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> This was shipped very quickly and arrived packaged wonderfully~&lt;br /&gt;I would give this product 5 starts if it weren&#x27;t for the smell--it is not a &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; smell--it just smells like unprocessed honey....(yah, I know that  is &#x27;what it is&#x27;) but it lingers a little too long for my taste.  If you have a sensitive nose, this may bother you.&lt;br /&gt;BUT it moisturizes like nobody&#x27;s business!  Gooooooood stuff for that!  I have the WORST dry feet you could ever imagine and  after a pedicure using other feet creams, lotions, potions you name it--my feet are back to sandpaper within a couple of weeks.  But with this Sweet Bee Magic--noooooo dry feet!  Put some in your hand and emulsify--rub it on--put some socks on and *Bazinga* smooth, moisturized tootsies.  I even had some rough callous on my heels and this Sweet Bee Magic has softened them out.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use on my feet...it is far enough away from my nose that the smell doesn&#x27;t bother me way down there~lol&lt;br /&gt;Wish there was a way for this to be truly &amp;#34;fragrance free&amp;#34; I would slather this stuff all over my body!!</li>
    <li> I brought this cream months ago  and it did nothing for my face,  I was so angry I threw it with the pile of other stuff I purchased that didn&#x27;t work.....My hair  was pulling out, very dry and dull so I thought I&#x27;d put some of this Bee thing on my hair to give it some shine.... well what do you know, I&#x27;m not kidding, the magic worked on my hair, the falling out literally stopped, I would comb and comb and nothing, really,  I&#x27;m in shock and disbelief but hey it is called a miracle cream , now I&#x27;m a believer.....it did nothing for my face but it sure worked on my hair......... I&#x27;m about to purchase another one will use it consistently and give any update latter on.</li>
    <li> good price. big buzz about this.  I use on cuticle nails. for very dry skin. otherwise a little too thick</li>
    <li> My favorite use is as a lip balm (which would last years in this size) &amp; as a balm for cracked heels. I&#x27;ve used on my face (sensitive, dry-ish skin, with bouts of rosacea) &amp; it&#x27;s oK in a pinch, but even the thinnest layer takes forever to absorb, remaining sticky a long time. So lips &amp; cuticles, really, is what I&#x27;m using it for.</li>
    <li> As some other reviews have said, this is good but not great. Pros: helped clear up my acne a bit and it&#x27;s a very effective moisturizer...I always wake up with smooth, hydrated skin. Also it&#x27;s safe to put on my lips, so I use it as chapstick sometimes. Cons: Feels a bit greasy/oily...it helps if you rub it in for a bit, but I still wouldn&#x27;t want to put my head on a pillow until it dries up a little. Basically it does make my skin look better, but not so much so that it&#x27;s some kind of miracle cream, or worth the greasy feeling (also if my hair touches my face accidentally it makes my hair greasy...I have bangs so this is kind of a problem). I think I&#x27;ll try some other similar creams first, but I wouldn&#x27;t mind buying this again, as it hydrates my skin better that normal drugstore creams.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! So moisturizing and I love the smell.</li>
    <li> Absolutely UH-MAZING product! Feels amazing on my skin and ever works on acne.</li>
    <li> it is perfect .I really recommend.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product thinking it would be useful as an all-around healing skin cream, and (more particularly) hoping that it would help diminish past acne scars I have on my neck and chin area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that this product is great to have on hand for minor scrapes, burns, and skin irritation, and it&#x27;s been very moisturizing for my dry spots (feet, cuticles, elbows, etc.). It has also helped with some of my more recent scarring; however, it hasn&#x27;t really done much for the old, persnickity spots yet. I was worried that the skin cream would clog my pores, as it&#x27;s pretty oily (and my skin freaks out at the slightest provocation) but it actually seems to be improving the tone and texture of my skin.  I use it at night so that my face isn&#x27;t beaming an oily shine to people during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a useful, multi-purpose cream to have around.  Will definitely repurchase in the bigger jar after this one runs out.</li>
    <li> I must say that I bought this product and it has been absolutely wonderful. When my facial skin or anywhere else for that matter needs moisture or softening I use this. It is also so great for sensitive skin. My skin is drier now than when I was younger and I have a tendency to react to many other moisturizers that have any sort of chemical in them. This cream has given me no bad reaction whatsoever as it is only really good natural chemical free ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a tip for using under makeup. I first add a little water to my face and then apply a very small amount to my hands and then to my whole face. If it seems too heavy I just blot a little. When using just as a moisturizer I apply heavier for full treatment. It can be oily but that is the nature of these ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also great for scrapes, bites, small sores, etc. It has full healing properties in my experience!&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful product that I&#x27;m so glad that I purchased.</li>
