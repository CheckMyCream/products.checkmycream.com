      <li>If I continue to see improvements in my skin I may come back and give this a 5 star, but until I find the absolutely perfect skin care product for my skin, it&#x27;s going to be 4 stars.</li>
      <li>so I appreciate a more &amp;#34;tingly&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s now been more than a month</li>
      <li>If I were to recommend it, I would say it&#x27;s great for older or combination skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very impressed with how well this has worked to get rid of my acne and even more compressed at how easy it was to implement into my daily routine.</li>
      <li>I have tried many neutrogena products as well as other brands of acne cleansers and this one has been the best for me.</li>
      <li>Great product &amp; very reasonable compared to higher end acne systems.  </li>
      <li>This has a nice soft texture when applying and a nice scent to it.</li>
      <li>As a 40-something, this is too strong for everyday use but perfect for the flare ups that continue to crop up</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not comfortable using a product that is so strong that it bleaches a towel even after I&#x27;ve done my best to rinse it all away,</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product over Proactive because it is much cheaper and more effective!</li>
      <li>I picked up this face wash in a local store and It was a happy find.  </li>
      <li>I found this to be more effective, less drying, and a nice one-step alternative.</li>
      <li>So far I’m very pleased.</li>
      <li>I am really excited to have found this product.</li>
      <li>I gave this to mu 14yo son, who has some mild acne.</li>
      <li>It works and its super inexpensive.</li>
      <li>is that not only does it control my acne better than others I&#x27;ve tried, but it is smooth (no gritties!)</li>
      <li>considering buying and have even mild acne problems I would give it a try.</li>
      <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with how well this worked on my hormonal breakout and will be using this again.</li>
      <li>Absolutely the most effective daily treatment for spots caused by sweating at the gym and running.</li>
      <li>However, I have dry skin and a good moisturizer will counteract the effects of the dryness.</li>
      <li>This wash was gentle &amp; very quickly</li>
      <li>Try this product it is definitely worth it.</li>
      <li>So worth it though.</li>
      <li>It knocks out the acne pretty quick.</li>
      <li>The Neutrogena Rapid Clear cleanser is just that - strong with quick results.</li>
      <li>Remember, however, that it may not work for everyone and other good health habits like eating well</li>
      <li>but I always moisturize right after.</li>
      <li>/&gt;While this product is definitely effective, I will happily return to using something that is milder but less alarming (and damaging to my towels).</li>
      <li>The cream itself has little odor and is pleasant to use.</li>
      <li>and it has a light, fresh scent - kind of like baby powder, but not strong smelling at all.  </li>
      <li>It really itches and my skin is super irritated.</li>
      <li>I have been using Neutrogena products since I was a pizza faced kid in my parents’ house and the products have only gotten better over the years.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend!!  </li>
      <li>work!&lt;br /&gt;Another stellar product from the Neutrogena</li>
      <li>I find Oxy pads or similar pads to work better than this cleanser.</li>
      <li>Also, it seems to be gentle enough not to cause more issues.</li>
      <li>This Neutrogena product worked as good as or better than any of the previous tries.</li>
      <li>In fact my skin was super soft to the touch I wanted to cry!</li>
      <li>This stuff is perfect for deflating any gross flareups and really does reduce it in just a few hours!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different products such as clean and clear advantage, Neutrogena body clear scrub, Neutrogena all in one acne control, Neutrogena acne stress control and their spot treatments, Loreal grapefruit face wash... and nothing has worked as effective as their Rapid Clear.</li>
      <li>I never did understand why companies put those gritties in there when dermatologists and studies recommend that people with oily skin and large pores do not use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I really like how it cleans.  </li>
      <li>On the flip side, start carefully to make sure there are no adverse reactions to the ingredients.  </li>
      <li>but I thought that this one really deserved it.</li>
      <li>really does</li>
      <li>and it did not do nearly as much as Neutrogena does.</li>
      <li>Made my skin feel very refreshed after using and it seemed to do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Very meh, it didn&#x27;t help me at all.</li>
      <li>My breakouts are mild, so I really don&#x27;t need anything major to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Ok, so I&#x27;m 18 and my acne isn&#x27;t extreme</li>
      <li>And I wanted to also mention I thought this would over dry my already sensitive combination super dry/oily skin, it did not!!</li>
      <li>I found Neutrogena Rapid Clear to be a very mild cleanser actually.</li>
      <li>Say what you will but having visible acne as an adult is pretty embarrassing.</li>
      <li>Despite being of a certain age, I still have occasional break outs that require something strong and fast acting.</li>
      <li>However, I do notice that my breakouts are much less when I use products with benzoyl peroxide rather than the salicylic acid, which most seem to have these days.  </li>
      <li>Went back to the dermatologist, she prescribed many different regiments, but nothing worked.</li>
      <li>Everyone&#x27;s skin is different so you may see different results, but for me benzoyl peroxide works much better on my acne than salicylic acid.</li>
      <li>He tried it a few times, but it didn&#x27;t do much for him, in fact it made his skin look more oily.</li>
      <li>It feels more dried out and my acne is still just as much as before.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I get the occasional break out, for no apparent reason, so I thought I would give this a try, to see if it would help. My breakouts are mild, so I really don&#x27;t need anything major to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This helped make the acne go away faster, but it made my face dry out.  It makes sense that it would do that, but I am just letting you know in case this is a concern for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a cost effective cleanser, give this a try.  It might just be what you are looking for.</li>
    <li> Typically, I never have serious acne. From time to time, I have hormonal acne or just the random flare up. For the times when the flare ups are not cured by my standard methods, this cleanser has become my go to. It knocks out the acne pretty quick. While I am not a fan of the smell, it is works well enough to over look that. Also, it seems to be gentle enough not to cause more issues.</li>
    <li> I am 33 years old and have never had a problem with breakouts until about six months ago.  After using this product for only two days, my acne is nearly gone, and my natural shine is back.  I am so grateful for this product and will continue using it.</li>
    <li> Amazing!! I used to use benaclin topical cream and take minocyclin for years as a teen. For some reason, that stopped working. Went back to the dermatologist, she prescribed many different regiments, but nothing worked. Finally, after a year of dermatologist visits and considering Accutane, I gave up and started buying different things from the drug store. Nothing worked. I struggled for about two years with this. Seemed like I would get a new zit everyday, had a minimum of 5 zits on my faces at a time, started appearing on my neck, thought I&#x27;d never be clear again. Saw a commercial last week for Neutrogena rapid clear, went to Target and bought the cleanser and topical cream, and after A WEEK my skin is basically clear. I have like one zit maybe, but you can barely notice it. The cleanser smells amazing, but doesn&#x27;t feel good when you get it in your eyes, Lol. I am 26 years old and so far I like the results I am getting with this. Way better than Proactive, better than using Salicyclic Acid products. It does make my skin a tad dry, but I just put an application of face lotion on with it before bed. So many of my coworkers have already noticed a difference. If my case seems similar to yours, I would definitely give it a try!</li>
    <li> If you wear eye make up you&#x27;ll need to use a cosmetic remover before this. Works well without completely stripping my skin of moisture.  I bought this as an alternative to a popular acne cleansing system because I didn&#x27;t want to sign up for recurring orders. I only need occasional use. I found this to be more effective, less drying, and a nice one-step alternative.</li>
    <li> I have acne.  I&#x27;m 50 years old and still have to fight pimples on my face!  I get a small breakouts every few weeks.  This has been my constant battle since puberty!  Needless to say, I&#x27;ve tried a wide variety of products.  So far nothing has been the perfect answer to perfectly beautiful skin.  However, I do notice that my breakouts are much less when I use products with benzoyl peroxide rather than the salicylic acid, which most seem to have these days.  This product, Neutrogena Rapid Clear, contains benzoyl peroxide.  I&#x27;ve been using it about a week now and I really like how it cleans.  It also doesn&#x27;t have the little &amp;#34;gritties&amp;#34; that other products seem to love putting in there, making it a &amp;#34;scrub.&amp;#34;  Seriously, when you already have large pores from acne and oily skin, those little gritties aren&#x27;t really good for you - the can cause small tearing of the pores which makes them larger.  I never did understand why companies put those gritties in there when dermatologists and studies recommend that people with oily skin and large pores do not use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;what I like about this product is that not only does it control my acne better than others I&#x27;ve tried, but it is smooth (no gritties!) and it has a light, fresh scent - kind of like baby powder, but not strong smelling at all.  it is easy to rinse off and, again, no left over little gritties to deal with.  I have not had any issue with dryness, but then my skin is used to acne medication.  If you&#x27;re not used to it, and you get a lot of drying, I&#x27;d suggest using it just once a day for at least a week then up it to twice a day.  Also, get a good oil-free lotion to follow it with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line - I like this much better than the others I&#x27;ve tried (Biore, Aveeno, Olay).  Everyone&#x27;s skin is different so you may see different results, but for me benzoyl peroxide works much better on my acne than salicylic acid. Most product these days don&#x27;t use the benzoyl peroxide, so I&#x27;m glad to to see Neutrogena including it here.  If I continue to see improvements in my skin I may come back and give this a 5 star, but until I find the absolutely perfect skin care product for my skin, it&#x27;s going to be 4 stars.eutrogena including it here.

    <li> I am in my early 20s and I have slight to moderate acne all the time. However, I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month and I LOVE it! It works amazingly. I have noticeably less acne, and even my acne scars are starting to disappear. I will definitely be repurchasing!</li>
    <li> I have been using Neutrogena products since I was a pizza faced kid in my parents’ house and the products have only gotten better over the years. I don’t have a severe acne problem but on occasions I have a minor outbreak and it is embarrassing at my age. This has a nice soft texture when applying and a nice scent to it. Made my skin feel very refreshed after using and it seemed to do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If considering buying and have even mild acne problems I would give it a try. It helped me.</li>
    <li> I gave this 4 stars because it does what it says. However, after several days of using it I have a rash on my neck and jaw line. It really itches and my skin is super irritated. I&#x27;ve never had an issue with putting anything on my skin before. I&#x27;ve used other acne medication without an issue. Seems looking at other reviews and sites I&#x27;m not the only one... So I would try it and if you don&#x27;t develop a rash then perfect, you will love this product.</li>
    <li> This works so well. It cleared up my stubborn acne on my chin within 24 hours. I absolutely love it and will be buying again! Nothing else seemed to be working for me (even dermatologist prescribed medication!), but this worked wonders.</li>
    <li> Over the past 20 years, other acne products have made my skin feel nice, but none of them significantly changed my acne. I always had many ugly zits all over my face no matter what I used. Not cool for being in my 30s. Within a week of using Neutrogena Rapid Clear Stubborn Acne Cleanser, the red spots were gone!! I still get little bumps but they don&#x27;t get big or red and my blackheads have noticeably decreased in size. It&#x27;s now been more than a month and I&#x27;m still getting great results. The only down side for me is my face feels a little dry (but doesn&#x27;t look it) and slightly itchy (not that bad but occasionally noticeable). May not work for everyone, but I&#x27;m sticking with it.</li>
    <li> I have used this 2 weeks. Now, I do not have any red acne in my face. I love this!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Neutrogena Rapid Clear Stubborn Acne Cleanser, 5 Ounce&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still have some persistent acne, even as I approach 60. I’ve tried various over the counter and prescription creams. Some helped none worked. This Neutrogena product worked as good as or better than any of the previous tries. I’m going to continue to use this and see if it helps me long term So far I’m very pleased. The cream itself has little odor and is pleasant to use. I’m impressed an hopeful that this is the one.</li>
    <li> Just as advertised. I tried everything else with salicylic acid and nothing worked. Finally with this I have clear skin</li>
    <li> Wow!  I LOVE this cleanser!!  It has a very weird texture, so I was worried at first.  It is more like a lotion instead of a nice foaming wash, but it sure does work great!  I am in my late 30s, and still have acne :-(  Nothing serious, but always 1-2 on the chin areal.  I barely ever get a pimple anymore.  This has done wonders for my chin!!  I would highly recommend!!  It does bleach out your towels though, so you might want to use something you don&#x27;t care about.  So worth it though.</li>
    <li> My 13 year old nephew has pretty bad acne, and this stuff did help a lot with his problem.&lt;br /&gt;It really does work!&lt;br /&gt;Another stellar product from the Neutrogena family.&lt;br /&gt;Very recommended!</li>
    <li> I have suffered from severe acne and sensitive oily skin ever since I was 11 years old and have tried numerous benzyl peroxide products, antibiotics, and prescription creams with little success. On any given day before I started using this wash, I would have 10+ red inflamed pimples on my face, cystic acne along my jawline, and wicked blackheads on my nose. I&#x27;ve only been using this wash once a day for about 2 weeks now in combination with birth control and the Clinique Dramatically Different moisturizer and all I can say is WOW. The difference has been incredible and I&#x27;m overjoyed to have found my holy grail acne wash.</li>
    <li> This product did help to clear my acne, and it was fast acting.  I saw results after only two applications.  I experienced no skin irritation and thought the cleanser felt fine when I applied it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I was very unhappy with the extent to which this bleached my washcloths and towels.  There is a warning that states &amp;#34;avoid contact with hair or dyed fabrics, which may be bleached by this product.&amp;#34;  However, I interpreted that to mean that if I spilled a big blob of it on my shirt, it might bleach it.  I didn&#x27;t expect that it would bleach my washcloth, and I absolutely didn&#x27;t expect it to bleach the towels that I used to pat my face dry after I had thoroughly rinsed my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not comfortable using a product that is so strong that it bleaches a towel even after I&#x27;ve done my best to rinse it all away, and I also don&#x27;t particularly want to use a bleaching agent that apparently stays on my skin even after I&#x27;ve tried to rinse it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this product is definitely effective, I will happily return to using something that is milder but less alarming (and damaging to my towels).</li>
    <li> Very meh, it didn&#x27;t help me at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different products such as clean and clear advantage, Neutrogena body clear scrub, Neutrogena all in one acne control, Neutrogena acne stress control and their spot treatments, Loreal grapefruit face wash... and nothing has worked as effective as their Rapid Clear. I am so happy I found and bought this product. It literally worked over night, no exaggeration. Whereas I should of woken up with these huge blemishes, this product really brought the inflammation and redness down. The blemishes themselves are barely noticeable had I not used this the night before I would of had my regular unsightly blemishes. Try this product it is definitely worth it. And I wanted to also mention I thought this would over dry my already sensitive combination super dry/oily skin, it did not!! In fact my skin was super soft to the touch I wanted to cry! I used my daily moisturizer and SPF as I normally do before I head out.</li>
    <li> I have tried so.... Many face washes after I had broke out so bad because the one I was using th at had my acne under control was discontinued I decided to try this one and I am so glad I get hormonal acne and acne right before I get my period and nothing I love it would recommend to anyone!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product, I only gave it 4 stars because it smells weird #crowdtap</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a month now, and it has done NOTHING for my skin. If anything, I feel like it&#x27;s made it worse. It feels more dried out and my acne is still just as much as before.</li>
    <li> I have never written reviews for a product before but I thought that this one really deserved it. I had perfect skin up until my sophomore year of high school and I started to get it BAD. I tried about every acne system the drugstore had to offer and was even considering going to the dermotologist until I discovered this product. This stuff is perfect for deflating any gross flareups and really does reduce it in just a few hours!! I am now going to be a senior and after 2 years of hiding my face under pounds of foundation/powder my acne is almost completely gone after using this for about 2 months. This acne wash has seriously been a lifesaver!!!</li>
    <li> Ok, so I&#x27;m 18 and my acne isn&#x27;t extreme but it isn&#x27;t a walk in the park either. I still get pimples but it&#x27;s every once in awhile compared to me always breaking out. When I first tried this product, my skin had THE WORST reaction. It felt as if my skin was on fire and it was peeling everywhere. It was awful. Since it says it treats stubborn acne, I didn&#x27;t want to give up on the product just yet, and I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t. I waited about a week and a half before I tried using it again, meaning I waited until the peeling of my skin was finally over. I use this about once a day after I&#x27;ve washed off all of my makeup (I use the grapefruit cleanser because it washes off ALL of my makeup), and then I use this stuff. It&#x27;s a godsend. After using it your skin feels clean and tingly and awesome but I always moisturize right after. If your skin has a bad reaction, wait a week or two before trying again, I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
    <li> Ive tried many other face wash cleansers for acne prone skin including proactive and this if the first one I&#x27;ve tried that actually works. I noticed the difference in this cleanser immediately after using it. Since I have been using it, I have had no break outs. My skin is clearer than its been in a long time. I use the Rapid Clear lotion by Neutrogena after the cleanser. You have to use a lotion after the cleanser so your skin doesn&#x27;t dry out. I am really excited to have found this product. It works and its super inexpensive.</li>
    <li> I have always struggle with acne and have spent so much money trying to clear it up. Recently, I was paying $60/month for a new system and not seeing results. Within 2 days of using this face wash (along with the toner), my skin has finally cleared up! I&#x27;m so happy!!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely the most effective daily treatment for spots caused by sweating at the gym and running.</li>
    <li> As a 35 year old woman with PCOS I&#x27;m finding that the acne I never dealt with as a teenager has become a demon to deal with on my thirties. Say what you will but having visible acne as an adult is pretty embarrassing. I&#x27;m also not someone who tends to spend tons of time on any sort of beauty care regimen, so I was worried that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to stick with applying an acne cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so wrong! The fact that you&#x27;re able to bring the tube into the shower and to simply wash your face with it, regardless of whether you take morning or evening showers, has made it possible for me to use the product regularly. As other reviewers state, your skin can get a bit dry with this, as mine did, so I&#x27;ve had to start using a moisturizer right after I get out of the shower as well, but I probably should&#x27;ve been doing that anyway. I&#x27;m very impressed with how well this has worked to get rid of my acne and even more compressed at how easy it was to implement into my daily routine.</li>
    <li> This cleared up the hormonal acne I&#x27;m prone to in the first few days of use and I was delighted. However, with continued use it began generating micro pimples on my skin. Clearly some sort of allergic reaction. I&#x27;ve had similar mixed results with other, newer Neutrogena products. I&#x27;m beginning to think it&#x27;s the products that have floral scents that, while they tackle the problem they&#x27;re intended to, actually generate other issues overtime. I&#x27;d love it if Neutrogena would release scent-free versions of this and other, similar products.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t by this product on Amazon, but will in the future for lower cost.  I picked up this face wash in a local store and It was a happy find.  I&#x27;m 42 &amp; had a bad breakout of cystic acne.  It was painful &amp; embarrassing.  This wash was gentle &amp; very quickly I saw results. I have very sensitive skin &amp; this wash did not dry it out.  I was desperate so I did use it twice a day to start, but have since cut down to once a day.  Great product &amp; very reasonable compared to higher end acne systems.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Your teen (or whomever is using it) needs to be diligent in skin care for it to do its job. The medication in this OTC cleanser has helped my 16yo more than the other common ingredient in many cleansers...even another category of Neutrogena products. On the flip side, start carefully to make sure there are no adverse reactions to the ingredients.  Remember, however, that it may not work for everyone and other good health habits like eating well make a difference as well.</li>
    <li> Good product. Works well. Good for people with oily skin.</li>
    <li> This is the absolute best acne cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used! I had really bad cystic acne on my chin and it completely cleared it up. It only took it 3 days to clear up my acne. I was very impressed. I love that this has benzoyl peroxide not sure I spelled that right but that is really hard to find in acne products. It helps a lot. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with severe acne. I will definitely re buy this when I run out.</li>
    <li> Despite being of a certain age, I still have occasional break outs that require something strong and fast acting. The Neutrogena Rapid Clear cleanser is just that - strong with quick results. As a 40-something, this is too strong for everyday use but perfect for the flare ups that continue to crop up every so often.&lt;br /&gt;I know this is targeted to teens but it is a great product for adults as well.</li>
    <li> I used this cleanser as a spot treatment (since benzoyl peroxide can cause excessive drying) rather than all over my face. I used it on clean wet skin as directed and rinsed it off after massaging it into skin for 30 seconds or so. I followed up with my usual argan oil and that was it. I don&#x27;t know about the overnight claim, but the duration of the breakout was noticeably shorter (maybe 3 days as opposed to 5 to 7). And I noticed very little drying (although that may be due to the argan oil). Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with how well this worked on my hormonal breakout and will be using this again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple of months now and it has worked wonders. I have tried many neutrogena products as well as other brands of acne cleansers and this one has been the best for me. I never had terrible acne, but when I did get it acne, they were always huge pimples that would leave very dark scars. As a result, I have always had bad acne scarring. Since I have been using this product, I have had almost no breakouts. Occasionally, I might get a tiny pimple, but if spend extra time cleansing that area with this product, the pimple is usually gone in a day or two with no acne scars left behind. Because of this product, I have finally gotten rid of my majority of my acne scars, because I stopped suffering from continuous breakouts. My only warning with this product is that it is very drying. However, I have dry skin and a good moisturizer will counteract the effects of the dryness. Overall this product has been a lifesaver.</li>
    <li> I gave this to mu 14yo son, who has some mild acne. He tried it a few times, but it didn&#x27;t do much for him, in fact it made his skin look more oily. I had a few pimples on my chin, so I decided to try it myself. It doesn&#x27;t really make any foam, and the cleanser is thick and heavy, so it didn&#x27;t feel like my skin was totally clean at first. But I have to admit, my chin cleared up within a day! If I were to recommend it, I would say it&#x27;s great for older or combination skin.</li>
    <li> I found Neutrogena Rapid Clear to be a very mild cleanser actually. I have a lot of problem with acne so I appreciate a more &amp;#34;tingly&amp;#34; cleanser. I don&#x27;t have cystic acne so I don&#x27;t need a professional cleanser, by I find Oxy pads or similar pads to work better than this cleanser. It&#x27;s fine for everyday face cleansing, but I wouldn&#x27;t consider it an option for stubborn acne as it claims.</li>
    <li> Incredible! After a few days I saw extreme visible results. I used Proactive for 4 years before I found this product and it did not do nearly as much as Neutrogena does. I highly recommend this product over Proactive because it is much cheaper and more effective!</li>
