      <li>I could not be more pleased with it or with the seller!</li>

      <li>I have purchased many Givenchy Gentleman by Givenchy for men over the years.</li>
      <li>and I still love the smell.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Personally, I love it, now that I have learned not to douse myself.</li>
      <li>My husband doesn&#x27;t care for many men&#x27;s fragrances, but he likes this one.</li>
      <li>I was able to get a refund by calling in and explaining an issue.</li>
      <li>This happens to be my favorite for many years.</li>
      <li>I love Givenchy been using this product</li>
      <li>The packaging looked authentic except for the cap.</li>

      <li>Have been using Givenchy Gentleman for many, many years</li>
      <li>I never leave any reviews, and I have always been satisfied with amazon products.</li>
      <li>My favorite go-to scent.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE THE WAY IT SMELLS</li>
      <li>If you are a fan of this cologne, definitely purchase it from Amazon for you will love the product and great value you receive! :)</li>
      <li>Very clean.  </li>
      <li>Good price, ship on time, thanks!</li>
      <li>The original product my husband used was very strong.  </li>
      <li>Unique and incredibly elegant.</li>
      <li>Amazon has a GREAT price for it and it comes in great packaging to assure you that it won&#x27;t arrive broken.</li>
      <li>If it isn&#x27;t, the copy is fantastic.</li>
      <li>Smelled like a used diaper filled with Indian food.</li>
      <li>I do hope to fine the original.</li>
      <li>Bought this kind purely by accident, I had gone to an ulta store with my fianc√©e and while she was looking at all the makeup I went over to the men&#x27;s cologne area and sprayed some of the givenchy gentlemen only, she smelt it and loved it</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not like the original.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Quietly male, exotic, and very sexy -- the right thing to wear with a suit when you&#x27;re spending the evening with a woman who appreciates the finer things in life.</li>
      <li>Could this be true?</li>
      <li>This is more for an evening out and not so much during the day or at the office.</li>
      <li>He absolutely loves this cologne, and I absolutely love it as well.  </li>
      <li>The fragrance is elegant and full of strength at the same time, balance that makes it special and unique personality</li>
      <li>It smells awesome and last all day long!  </li>
      <li>Huge bottle and a gift that definitely says \\&quot;I LOVE YOU\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>Matter of fact it smells more like old play-doe.  </li>
      <li>so I was able to do a direct comparison.</li>
      <li>Well, it is the cologne that I&#x27;m really paying for and I like it, so I shouldn&#x27;t complain too much about the bottle. :)</li>
      <li>Very glad it&#x27;s still available, and even more surprised Amazon offered it as cash was tight but had an Amazon gift card to redeem towards purchase.</li>
      <li>This Givenchy Gentleman is really the original.</li>
      <li>In fact, I still have a bottle of the original cologne that I refuse to use and the product that you are selling is not the real deal.  </li>
      <li>gives just the right touch without overdoing it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>version is softer but still real powerhouse and true masterpiece.</li>
      <li>They did it right the first time.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
      <li>Since it can not be returned due to hazardous rating they just issued a credit to my card right away.  </li>
      <li>This is not the real deal!  </li>
      <li>The only product I will use and this was a better price than I have seen elsewhere.</li>
      <li>I wish there way a way to know if you are buying the real thing!</li>
      <li>This is a potent fragrance, only for those who want to make people say, as they walk by, &amp;#34;Who&#x27;s wearing patchouli?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I know exactly what it smells like.  </li>
      <li>Tarragon, cinnamon, bergamot, patchouli, vetiver, sandalwood, rose, carnation, civet, Russian leather - all bound to perfection in this deep, rich, irresistible cologne.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t recommend this product at all, if you want some seriously good Givenchy products try Givenchy Xeryus Rouge, Givenchy pour Homme ( sometimes called Red Label ), Givenchy Blue Label, and Givenchy Pi...</li>
      <li>This item was exactly as described and came VERY well-wrapped / protected.  </li>
      <li>It is hard to find in local stores, and the good news here is that the product is genuine</li>
      <li>Musky, but not too much so.  </li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>It seems to me it is much lighter now</li>
      <li>and I know the real thing.</li>
      <li>This is not the real product.</li>
      <li>very manly fragrance with lots of class.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
      <li>I have mini-bottle of the REAL Givenchy Gentleman and the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; one doesn&#x27;t even compare, scent-wise, with what&#x27;s in the mini-bottle.  </li>
      <li>But I must not be the only one who likes it because it is available online and in perfume specialty stores.</li>
      <li>The bottom line is that it smells quite nice, but it&#x27;s not the same as my last bottle of Givenchy Gentleman.</li>
      <li>negative is its a strong fragrance and can  easily be overdone</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not aware of many others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This was new, in a closed box and very light on the scent.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Repeat order. Wonderful fragrance, good price, good packaging, prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> A very sexy scent!  My husband doesn&#x27;t care for many men&#x27;s fragrances, but he likes this one. I do too!!</li>
    <li> Great gift item.  A wonderful scent which my husband loved years ago and so did I.  Bought it as a gift and he was pleased with it more than any of his other expensive colognes. Huge bottle and a gift that definitely says \\&quot;I LOVE YOU\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> This was my first experience with this cologne, so I cannot comment on whether the scent is not like it was in the past. I do like the version that I ended up with, in any case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it says in the title to this review, if you like patchouli, you&#x27;ll like this cologne. It will be the dominate scent when applied after things settle a bit. Ignore the initial scent as it fades out fast, then the patchouli is very evident. It is hard to find cologne with such a nice patouchli presence. I&#x27;m not aware of many others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first got it, the scent would last a long time. Lately, it seems to fade faster. - I&#x27;ve only had the bottle a few months. Maybe I&#x27;m just too used to it or need to put a little more on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some less positive things that I noticed is that the label and cap on the bottle look a little cheaply done. Would have expected something a little more fitting from Givenchy. Well, it is the cologne that I&#x27;m really paying for and I like it, so I shouldn&#x27;t complain too much about the bottle. :)</li>
    <li> Bought this kind purely by accident, I had gone to an ulta store with my fianc√©e and while she was looking at all the makeup I went over to the men&#x27;s cologne area and sprayed some of the givenchy gentlemen only, she smelt it and loved it so I wanted to purchase it, turns out I had ordered this horrible smelling &amp;#34;cologne&amp;#34; instead of the gentlemen only.  It smells awful, and I just wish I had been paying more attention to what I was buying. This cologne is horrible.</li>
    <li> Good price, ship on time, thanks!</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted. Great, fresh and my favorite eau de toilette at a good price. Hope to keep finding it here.</li>
    <li> I remember the vintage version. It was rich, animalic, leathery, very brilliant scent. I was impressed as never before.&lt;br /&gt;New version is softer but still real powerhouse and true masterpiece. Unique and incredibly elegant. Not acceptable for little, immamture boys. This is scent of real man, with great sillage and devastating longevity on my skin (more than 12h). Uncompromising patchouli, honey, frankincense and leather gives me olfactory heaven. Is it dated? Not for me. This is the niche in mainstream fragrances.</li>
    <li> My favorite go-to scent.  I always get compliments when I wear it, often from strangers in elevators, etc... Light, long lasting fragrance.</li>
    <li> My husband loved it!!! I think he loves it too much he wears it everyday!</li>
    <li> This is not the real deal!  I have been using this cologne, Gentlemen by Givenchy, since 1980.  It is the only cologne I use and I know exactly what it smells like.  In fact, I still have a bottle of the original cologne that I refuse to use and the product that you are selling is not the real deal.  It is extremely disappointing to spend so much money to find out that I have purchased a counterfeit or knock-off product.  Check the legitimacy of your distributors to ensure it doesn&#x27;t tarnish your reputation.</li>
    <li> Been using this for at least 25 years. Is a good scent that is no longer marketed in department stores and in a variety of forms. But I must not be the only one who likes it because it is available online and in perfume specialty stores. This price was low but shipping was high; so I probably did not save a bunch.</li>
    <li> Rich, classy, musky, woody, opulent and yummy, just few words to describe this scent. I have been wearing it for over 34 years and I still love the smell. One of the worlds great scents for men. IMHO.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product.  I can smell it on someone from across the room.  It is amazing.  You won&#x27;t be sorry if you purchase this for a special someone.</li>
    <li> Best price, although fragrance has been changed a bit since I started using it 40 years ago, still my favorite.</li>
    <li> It almost seems like this product is watered down.  The original product my husband used was very strong.  This was new, in a closed box and very light on the scent.</li>
    <li> This is obviously not my cutest perfume. Will not use again. Smell is not so impressive. I&#x27;m disappointed against all comments I read prior to buying!!!</li>
    <li> MY HUSBAND LOVES THIS PRODUCT AND WILL ALWAYS WEAR IT... THIS IS HIS GO TO BOTTLE OF COLOGNE. I LOVE THE WAY IT SMELLS AND LAST ALL DAY IF NOT HEAVY SWEATING. I RECOMMEND</li>
    <li> It is a classic and gets more difficult to find every year.  I buy it as my husband&#x27;s go-to Christmas gift.  A refined and complex fragrance that transports me every time.</li>
    <li> Great fragrance....classic!</li>
    <li> The product came with a black cap instead of the normal silver. I spoke to a person in the fragrance industry who said this product came from Dubai and the fragrance contained less essential oils and more alcohol. The packaging looked authentic except for the cap.Could this be true?</li>
    <li> This is not a legitimate Givenchy product. Packaging and fragrance bottle both clearly knock-off Givenchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE don&#x27;t support counterfeit imitations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This so-called &amp;#34;Givenchy&amp;#34; fragrance smells repugnant regardless.</li>
    <li> Nothing to write home about.</li>
    <li> Tarragon, cinnamon, bergamot, patchouli, vetiver, sandalwood, rose, carnation, civet, Russian leather - all bound to perfection in this deep, rich, irresistible cologne. I buy this for my husband.</li>
    <li> Never get tired of it. Get a lot of compliments too, it&#x27;s a distinguished, subtle  and different distinctive style of mens cologne.</li>
    <li> This is a favorite and has been worn for many years. It was a very good price and arrived quickly!</li>
    <li> The negative reviews are ABSOLUTELY right.  Either it&#x27;s counterfeit or Givenchy has done a BAD reformulation, &amp;agrave; la &amp;#34;New Coke.&amp;#34;  The color of it was a tipoff; it was MUCH darker than the original.  I have mini-bottle of the REAL Givenchy Gentleman and the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; one doesn&#x27;t even compare, scent-wise, with what&#x27;s in the mini-bottle.  I just hope Givenchy hasn&#x27;t ruined &amp;#34;Pi,&amp;#34; also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon should check their fragrance supplier out.</li>
    <li> I have purchased many Givenchy Gentleman by Givenchy for men over the years. The product I received IS NOT the same spray!&lt;br /&gt;Although the spray has a favorable aroma, it IS NOT what I ordered. I believe the product I received is a &amp;#34;Knock Off.&amp;#34; I would like to return the product and receive another in its place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not Happy!</li>
    <li> I never leave any reviews, and I have always been satisfied with amazon products. But this is truly fake. Horrendous smell. Also, the cap is black, no chrome as on the picture. I was able to get a refund by calling in and explaining an issue. Thank you, Amazon, for excellent customer service, but these type of products should be banned.</li>
    <li> Speed is not the scent is a little long.&lt;br /&gt;Seems to be a scent that suits for men.</li>
    <li> Have been using Givenchy Gentleman for many, many years and this was a very good price.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> The only product I will use and this was a better price than I have seen elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I just opened up my new bottle that my wife gave me as a gift, and realized the smell was very different from the one I just finished up. I have been using this cologne for years. So, pls do not order from this company, as they are selling a fake product. I hardly ever give reviews, but wanted to at least lower the average rating of 4 stars that it has. This company should not be allowed to operate in Amazon. Btw, I complained to Amazon and I got an immediate refund from them, they are amazing. If my wife had read the reviews before ordering she would have realized not to order this product.&lt;br /&gt;FYI  I noticed that the real cologne has a label in the back of the bottle, which this one did not. Also the cap is black plastic instead of the original which is silver, as in the picture.</li>
    <li> Look-A-Like box &amp; bottle and labels, but not the same Cologne. I would never buy this again!!! I do hope to fine the original.</li>
    <li> This classy, long-lasting, masculine scent has been a personal favorite for over 30 years.  It&#x27;s always pleasant, without being overbearing, and gets favorable feedback from others.</li>
    <li> Best cologne on the market. Has a long wear time.</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne for my dad, its his &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; scent. When I first starting buying this cologne for my dad as a present (birthday, Christmas, etc), I purchased it at Nordstrom&#x27;s for over $60 a bottle. Amazon has a GREAT price for it and it comes in great packaging to assure you that it won&#x27;t arrive broken. If you are a fan of this cologne, definitely purchase it from Amazon for you will love the product and great value you receive! :)</li>
    <li> I am a Givenchy Gentleman user for 30 years. Many women have asked me, &amp;#34;What is that wonderful scent you have?&amp;#34; They want to give it to their man as a gift! I swear this stuff is irresistable! The finest woman getter out there! Two spritzes, and you WILL get compliments!</li>
    <li> This item was exactly as described and came VERY well-wrapped / protected.  I could not be more pleased with it or with the seller!</li>
    <li> I have used Givenchy Gentleman by Givenchy for Men 3.4 ounce EDT spray for years and I find it marvelous.&lt;br /&gt;It gives just the right touch without overdoing it.&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied with this cologne and use it daily.&lt;br /&gt;I dont try other products. It is unbeatable.</li>
    <li> Cologne is a very personal experience. This happens to be my favorite for many years. It is hard to find in local stores, and the good news here is that the product is genuine (you have to be careful - there are many fake perfumes and colognes around at &amp;#34;great&amp;#34; prices). And the price, for the real thing, was very good.</li>
    <li> This is not the real product. I have been using it since the 70&#x27;s and I know the real thing. I wish there way a way to know if you are buying the real thing!</li>
    <li> This Givenchy Gentleman is really the original. It smells awesome and last all day long!  This was shipped prompt. I am very happy with this seller.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Not only does this cologne NOT last long enough, it is too stodgy and stuffy for a person of my age ( I&#x27;m 37 years old turning 38 in early January ).  I am very disappointed with this fragrance because not only is the smell really off-putting to me it doesn&#x27;t last at all, I noticed that it would fade upon applying it... usually I buy winners but this one definitely was not one of them.  I can&#x27;t recommend this product at all, if you want some seriously good Givenchy products try Givenchy Xeryus Rouge, Givenchy pour Homme ( sometimes called Red Label ), Givenchy Blue Label, and Givenchy Pi... all are very, very good Givenchy products but this one reeks, it DOESN&amp;#34;T rock!</li>
    <li> It was ordered as a gift for a family member and arrived in excellent condition.  It is a very nice fragrance.</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume as a gift for my husband because he used it a lot in the 80&#x27;s and could no longer find it in regular stores.  He absolutely loves this cologne, and I absolutely love it as well.  Would recommend to those who used it in the 80&#x27;s or even todays new generation who is looking for something classic.</li>
    <li> I smelled this cologne at the store before I bought it and loved it, so I decided to purchase this from Amazon.com to save some money. Big mistake! When the package got here, it was trashed, half of it had leaked out, and it smelled like pig urine! Worst smell ever. Smelled like a used diaper filled with Indian food. Worst purchase from Amazon ever. Worst cologne ever. Worst experience ever.</li>
    <li> Seemingly ancient. Musky, but not too much so.  Touch of patchouli.  Lasts and lasts.  Ages like wine.  Subtle, yet SO present.  Sportive?  God no.</li>
    <li> The fragrance is elegant and full of strength at the same time, balance that makes it special and unique personality</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like it&#x27;s watered down.............it&#x27;s not like the original. It doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long as original. Should be cheaper.</li>
    <li> Hmmm not sure if I like it. üò© it&#x27;s very musky which reminds me of an old man. Oooppps! !</li>
    <li> Thank you for the great deal and the great price.</li>
    <li> Have worn this fragrance for 40 years. It&#x27;s my signature scent. Very glad it&#x27;s still available, and even more surprised Amazon offered it as cash was tight but had an Amazon gift card to redeem towards purchase.</li>
    <li> This bottle of Givenchy shown above in comparison was no were near the lasting fragrance quality as my bottle of eau de toilette 50ml vaporisateur Parfums Givenchy S.A.</li>
    <li> This product (cologne) never ceases to amaze me , this is the one and only cologne that I shall ever use !! And i been using it since1970 !!!</li>
    <li> Have been using Givenchy Gentleman for years and still get lots of compliments on it.  Wouldn&#x27;t change to anything else.  Had to get it at Duty Free shops for a long time, but then Amazon came along with it in current inventory. Cudos to Givenchy and to Amazon</li>
    <li> One of my all time favorites! This is more for an evening out and not so much during the day or at the office. Great buy!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff.</li>
    <li> Have used Gentleman by Givenchy for Men for over 40 years.  My wife says she likes the smell.  Very clean.  Not an overbearing  odor.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!! People always ask what after shave lotion I use because it smells so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;H Stoffers</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for 35 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Massive compliments throughout this time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RWH</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t like patchouli, avoid this cologne.  It was invented, I think, for the hippies who turned corporate, to remind them of their childhoods.  This is a potent fragrance, only for those who want to make people say, as they walk by, &amp;#34;Who&#x27;s wearing patchouli?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I love it, now that I have learned not to douse myself.</li>
    <li> They did it right the first time.&lt;br /&gt;A very manly fragrance with lots of class.&lt;br /&gt;Only negative is its a strong fragrance and can  easily be overdone</li>
    <li> This perfume is not exactly the same as my last bottle of Givenchy. I have been wearing this for 20+ years and the change is subtle, but noticeable. Some have alleged that these bottles aren&#x27;t genuine. If it isn&#x27;t, the copy is fantastic. The packaging exhibits a level of attention to detail that I have never seen in a knockoff. That this would be a very high quality copy seems unlikely for a product that no longer sells in mass quantities, so I assume that it&#x27;s genuine with a slightly altered formula. I still had some of my old bottle left so I was able to do a direct comparison. The bottom line is that it smells quite nice, but it&#x27;s not the same as my last bottle of Givenchy Gentleman.</li>
    <li> The Givenchy Gentlemen does not seem like the old I used to order. It almost seems fake or full of alcohol. EDT, I thought meant more of an oil base. Something has changed in the scent-subtle change, but different. I want the REAL old stuff</li>
    <li> The tarragon and bergamot give this a \\&quot;citrus\\&quot; top that smells as rich and golden as a Rembrandt; there&#x27;s just enough patchouli that it smells \\&quot;exotic\\&quot; without overpowering you, because it&#x27;s balanced by the honey note; and the civet and Russian leather give this a smoky, tannic \\&quot;cured\\&quot; quality that reminds one of the dangerous cafes where Bogie lurked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quietly male, exotic, and very sexy -- the right thing to wear with a suit when you&#x27;re spending the evening with a woman who appreciates the finer things in life.</li>
    <li> I used to use this when I was 18. It seems to me it is much lighter now but still  wonderful. Brigs back the memories when ladies used to ask me what I was wearing.</li>
    <li> Makes me smell great. Hard to find locally.</li>
    <li> I love Givenchy been using this product many years somehow when i bought this one and received it i sprayed some in my body and ths smell is so horrible...</li>
    <li> The product was not made by Givenchy.  Bottle was wrong shape, cap was black, not chrome, did not have printing on back of bottle which gives product info as a real bottle does, and does not smell like the real product.  Matter of fact it smells more like old play-doe.  You would think that at least the counterfeiters would have tried to get close on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now all that said, Amazon was absolutely wonderful about this problem.  Since it can not be returned due to hazardous rating they just issued a credit to my card right away.  No hassles what so ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would in particular like to thank Jodi O. the customer service person who handled this for me.  Her actions and the policies of Amazon once again proved why they are so very successful in the marketplace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Richard H.</li>
