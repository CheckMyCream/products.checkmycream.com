<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> There are so many new commercials out there about the amazing new flexball handle. The flexball doesn&#x27;t really make a difference in shaving. The razor is nice and not is reasonably priced, but if you still have another razor that works you don&#x27;t need to buy this one.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, totally recommended.!</li>
    <li> Happy about purchasing it. It is improved version of mach 3 with extra bell and whistle.</li>
    <li> Gillette Fusion Proglide, 5 Blade razors are the best on the market. Nothing but a straight razor can come close to the shave quality. The power makes the razor more effortless and painless, even if I cut myself, I barely notice it. My only gripe is that the flexball makes it hard to use the back blade to shape up my sideburns. If they could devise some sort of a lock that made the flexing stop when you needed it to, that would be the absolute ultimate shaver!</li>
    <li> By far the best razor I have used. I have used almost every single disposable razor and razors with cartridges and have to say this razor shaves the best out of them all. I especially have thick facial hair so usually I&#x27;m left with a shadow no matter if I shave. This razor gives me an almost baby smooth appearance and doesn&#x27;t give me a shadow until the next day. I also like have the single blade on the edge which is great for shaping up around my goatee and neck. I also always get really bad razor burn on my neck but with the razor I only have to pass each time once which helps prevents razor burn and bumps. I highly recommend this razor for everyone especially those with thick beards or whoever has trouble with razor burn or bumps.</li>
    <li> Not sure how much value the ball adds but the razor itself is great.</li>
    <li> Cuts better than the other Fusion Razor I had, this new model has much going for it love the thinner blades.</li>
    <li> as advertised.  great razor</li>
    <li> That is a very, very sharp knife, that is.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned a few of the Gillette models and would say this is a slight improvement over the last. I like the new technology but it didn&#x27;t change much the way I shave and feels a bit more smooth.</li>
    <li> Been using another brand for a while, and found this so much nicer. It&#x27;s all relative, but I have no complaints whatsoever about the quality of the shave - not a single drop of blood was drawn. Not sure if I can tell the difference in shave when the power is on though, suspect the same one without power is just as good.</li>
    <li> excellent product, good for money, prompt delivery by amazon,</li>
    <li> Works great. As expected.</li>
    <li> The husband very happy</li>
    <li> Works great. Husband loved it</li>
    <li> Nice razor. Expected more rotation</li>
    <li> Razor is a slight upgrade from the last version and the blades are better.  I wouldn&#x27;t say you will notice much difference with this razor that rotates with more degrees of freedom than the last version that just pivoted up and down, but for a few bucks I would still recommend it.  When you need new blades, give these new, thinner blades a try, I think you will notice they are improved over the prior version.</li>
    <li> The commercials do not lie.  This is the first product that I have used where I did not get razor burn.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this razor!!</li>
    <li> I like it very much.&lt;br /&gt;I can take a cleaner shave now.</li>
    <li> The gift to my father.He very like it</li>
    <li> This razor has, hands down, gave me one of the closest shaves I&#x27;ve ever gotten.  I love the combination of a powered shaver and the simplicity of the hand-held razor.  It glides over my skin...and leaves me smooth and nick-free.  It&#x27;s a great deal, and an even better one when combined with a coupon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a military man and that means shaving daily for the nearly 15 years I have served. For most of those years I&#x27;ve used an electric razor due to the fact that the first safety razor I tried didn&#x27;t give me a good shave and gave me horrible razor burn. That was many years ago and, thanks in no small part to my wife, I recently decided to try the safety razor again. For this trial, I selected the highly advertised Gillette Fusion Proglide with Flexball which she commented on every time we saw such an advertisement or walked past their display in the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette has really done well this time. With this razor, I get a good, close shave, and with many uses have yet to cut myself from shaving. My Fusion Proglide razor has, without trouble, left my face smooth for everything from daily shaving to removing a 10 day old goatee I tried out while on leave. What does this mean for my electric razor? I’ll still keep it around for when I don’t have the time for a wet shave, but for my regular use my choice is now the Fusion Proglide, until Gillette finds a way to improve upon seeming perfection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This post is in no way sponsored or endorsed by Gillette. I purchased this product and the expressed opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Great product and fulfillment</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product!!&lt;br /&gt;It makes the skin so clean and pure ...it becomes the skin of a baby!!&lt;br /&gt;Super well-raccomended!</li>
    <li> Went from a mach 3 that vibrated to this.  Best shave since i was 13 and learning.  Gets so close and unlike mach 3 i can get 3-4 shaves in a 3-4 week period out of my razors!</li>
    <li> buy it for my father, looks good.</li>
    <li> Good shave. Best razor I have so far. My only advice is to apply lotion to legs after because it can leave skin really dry.</li>
    <li> I love this knife , smooth movement on my face is perfect also cut very flush of my face so you do not have to pass more than once</li>
    <li> Gives a great shave and is very comfortable holding.  No drag and it glides right over my face while giving a super close shave.</li>
    <li> Have the Art of Shaving version and wanted a cheaper one for travel. Works as well as the more expensive AOS with the only difference being the lighter weight.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality blades and costs a lot less then at Walmart</li>
    <li> Love it, but the blades die real fast. I only used a razor on my neck and when I am taking a hot shower. This blade I think lasted me 3 weeks (6 uses on my neck) before it went dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I was given one of these. What a piece of junk. The Flexball is my judgment is nothing but marketing mumbo jumbo. The blades are inherently dull. I&#x27;m going back to my old school double-edge razor and Feather blades. You younger guys should really try a double-edge with Feather. That will give you a good shave.</li>
    <li> Best razor ever! Almost 7 weeks and still on original battery and blade. Less drag. Fewer strokes for smooth shave.</li>
    <li> Said to be electric, just shaking, feeling somewhat disappointed, easier to use to scratch the face, need to pay attention ~ other better</li>
    <li> Buy for dad, it&#x27;s very good.</li>
    <li> I got to try out Fusion ProGlide Manual razor with flexball along with the 2-in-1 gel through BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Fusion ProGlide Manual razor with FlexBall Technology:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Manual; I never understand why a razor should need a battery.  Give s me a clean shave and I like the trimmer attached to the back that allows me to do a more precise shave. Pivot mechanism works very well - but nothing exceptional from the past experiences with other razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I felt like I have to keep my finger on the flexball, which was an awkward holding position and uncomfortable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fusion ProGlide 2-in-1 Gel + Skin Care - Ocean Breeze:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: No leakage once you stop squeezing, really a no mess formula!  Nice menthol smell but not overly strong.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Doesn&#x27;t lather up very well.  It feels more like a face wash rather than a shaving cream.</li>
    <li> Good product, not as much upgrade from original Fusion Proglide.</li>
    <li> Always used Gillette and the new technology really does make a difference. Just a great close shave.</li>
    <li> perfect shaving tool, better than my previous manual one</li>
    <li> Works well. The vibrator may have other uses, not one I have a desire for...;)</li>
    <li> nice product. Gillette always try to put some thing new after research and that makes gillette no.1</li>
    <li> Results in comfortable shaves. What more can I say .</li>
    <li> I mean it works like any other razor but seeing how the blades are 4x the cost of the razor... i would find a different razor.</li>
    <li> Great product, I was skeptical earlier in buying it since I have the previous model, but these turned out to give a smoother and cleaner shave than expected.</li>
    <li> Awesome!  Major improvements just what the doctor ordered!</li>
    <li> Expensive blades make for a great shave!</li>
    <li> Nice razor. No nicks, no bleeding, no redness, no irritation.  Only negatives are the replacement blades run about $20 for 4 cart. at Walmart or target....and it doesn&#x27;t give me the closest shave I want on my face.  I usually make 3 passes and still see stubble/shadow...with the grain, sideways to the grain, and against the grain.  I&#x27;m actually eyeing the straight/safety razor shave.  That being said, this Gillette is a good razor...4 star.</li>
    <li> I live these razors. It works so good.</li>
    <li> Happy that it swivels according to the contour, reducing the chance of nicking still further. Even when I am in a hurry and try and shave in a haphazard manner, the razor does the job well.</li>
    <li> As an Army guy I&#x27;ve got to shave every day, and usually in a pretty big hurry.  I&#x27;ve tried just about every name brand and generic blade you can get your hands on, including those mail order blade companies with the hip trendy commercials, and electrics ranging from $20 to $200.  For my very coarse hairs electrics have never been able to hold a candle to the closeness I can get from a blade shave, and I&#x27;ve been shelling out for the Fusion line of blades since they came out because they absolutely provide the closest shave available, and despite their exorbitant price they hold an edge long enough that they are not as terrible a value proposition as you might think.  I&#x27;ve also found that the vibration does actually help to alleviate some of the razor tug and pull, especially near the end of the blade&#x27;s life span when I am trying to squeeze out &amp;#34;just one more shave&amp;#34; day after day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The big selling point with this razor is the &amp;#34;flex ball technology&amp;#34; which is supposed to to help the blade hug the curves of your face better.  While I&#x27;m not really sure what I expected that to &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; like, I do generally get the impression that it is pressing more evenly on my face that my non-flex ball razor when I do a side by side comparison.  I think the bigger telling factor is that I feel like I get a cleaner shave with fewer passes and have noticed less of those random &amp;#34;missed&amp;#34; hairs that you only seem to notice on your way to work when your shaving paraphernalia is long gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d buy this again without hesitation.  There are surely a lot of other options available, but for my money Gillette has been making the best razors on the market for quite some time now and this one is no exception.</li>
    <li> Great price, very happy with how it works. Best shave I&#x27;ve ever had</li>
    <li> Performs exactly as Mach3 but is too heavy, not worth the change</li>
    <li> My favorite Gillette razor</li>
    <li> After having received this product to try for free from Gillette, I have to say that I am extremely impressed with this razor. Having tried many different brands (including tradtional and electric razors), this FlexBall razor gives me one of the closest shaves I have ever had. I recently went on a business trip and had to use one of my traditional style razors, which made me fully appreciate how well the FlexBall allows the razor to contour to your face. As someone who is prone to nicking themself when shaving, I have used this razor for several weeks without a single cut. Even with the pivoting head, the edging blade gives a nice clean line for sideburns and the like. The handle is a bit bigger than most razors since it can take a battery, but I found that to be a positive since I felt that it gives me better control. Overall, this is a fantastic razor!</li>
    <li> Yoda777 from bzzagent here,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this product and simply loved it. I felt that it had some of the best angles and closeness of any razor ever; however, it is so close that some with sensitive skin have complained about it to me. My full post is on Bzzagent, but basically it is a great razor. If you want a smooth cut while using a razor that grips your face, go with the Gillette Proglide</li>
    <li> I received a free razor from Gillette for this particular product and really enjoyed the shave. I typically use the regular Gillette Fusion and was worried that by developing the product even more the close shave would fall short of what they deliver and was very impressed it did not! The razor in my opinion is a tad bit to fancy for my taste as the pivot head wasn&#x27;t needed for me at all but I would recommend it to others who have more to shave in tricky places. Really loved the close smooth shave I have come to expect from the Gillette brand!!</li>
    <li> When I was picked to try this razor as part of a campaign from Gillette, I was very excited and was eager to give it a go. I have been consistently using the Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall Handle for a couple of weeks now. I really like the FlexBall Handle and can only wish Gillette will someday add this feature to their ProGlide Styler. The FlexBall Handle allows the blades to flex left or right with the curvature of your face. I really could have used this feature when I first started shaving. It makes getting a close shave around your chin line so much easier to accomplish.I really like the FlexBall Handle.</li>
    <li> Love the proglide.  Never buying another razor.  This gives a close shave every time and refillable.</li>
    <li> It makes me happy to shave.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think the jiggling is much of an enhancement, but it hasn&#x27;t cut me yet, so that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this razor. It gives a clean shave and moves well on the contours of his face without cutting or giving a rash.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect， I like it very much</li>
    <li> A good razor with a AAA battery, 5 blade design makes the same location only need to scrape two times, satisfied</li>
    <li> This is the best yet!!!!!  Using this razor to shave my face and head, it is awesome, not only does the flexball improve glide, when you use the trimmer, it also works on that feature, making for a better shave overall.  I have used Gillette Fusion for years, started with the Mach 3, then to the fusion, then the proglide, I also have the styler, all are awesome, but this, this is the razor for me, I have previously nicked myself behind the ears when shaving my head, however with this, as I stated, the flexball technology improved that to take care of that issue.  I would highly recommend this and will be purchasing another one.  Get yours and enjoy the best shave yet offered by Gillette.</li>
    <li> I received a free Proglide from Gillette to try.  I have sensitive skin and I&#x27;ve used a safety razor for a few years.  I decided to try this razor because of the new technology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Uncomfortable, irritating, benefits of the Flexball are unclear&lt;br /&gt;Pro: The vibration helped provide a smoother glide than with no vibration&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I felt like the razor gave me micro-cuts.  This was true even after a few days of use.  I also didn&#x27;t feel like it provided me with as close of a shave as my safety razor.  In addition, the Flexball technology didn&#x27;t make sense to me.  I felt no benefits from the pivot and I think it added to the discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll stick with my safety razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m tired of the flimsy razors they market to women, so decided to try a manly razor. I was shocked&lt;br /&gt;at the check-out because the refills are costly! However, came home and immediately sat down to try it.&lt;br /&gt;My legs looked like porcipines it&#x27;s been that long since I&#x27;ve bothered to shave, but the Proglide lived up&lt;br /&gt;to it&#x27;s name - no water, no lotion, just bare, dry legs - it did a great job! Didn&#x27;t even nick myself, as I always&lt;br /&gt; do with a new razor. And Gillette, please don&#x27;t make a flimsy, pink version of this razor for women.</li>
    <li> I received this razor as a free product sample. It is really nice! It shaves much closer than the electric razor I usually use. The vibrating (power) feature does seem to help gain a closer shave - especially with 5 blades. The flexball technology really does curve with the contours of your face. The only drawback that I&#x27;ve seen is that it doesn&#x27;t clean very quickly when rinsing under hot water. It almost seems like the comfort strip hangs on to hairs that have been cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The build quality is top notch. It&#x27;s very sturdy and seems like it will last for a quite a while. It really is easy to use and does seem to glide through hair with little to no tugging. I will definitely be looking for replacement blades to continue using this razor!</li>
    <li> I received a Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor from Gillette to try out, and, it turned out to be a far, far better razor than I could have expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually have a pretty thick, partial beard at all times. I use an electric razor for most of my shaving, but I have a Gillette Mach 3 for when I want a nice, clean shave. Most razors that aren&#x27;t electric can&#x27;t even touch my beard, and a lot of electric razors even struggle. Not only did the Gillette Fusion Proglide give me a perfectly even, clean shave, but it felt great and was extremely gentle on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always been a sentimental fan of Gillette because they made the first razor I ever used when I started shaving, and Gillette Mach 3 blades have always served me well. I now have a more tangible reason to be a fan of Gillette, and a new favorite manual razor. The Gillette Fusion Proglide gave me THE BEST shave I have ever had from a manual razor, the vibration felt nice on my face and helped to keep the shave smooth and even, and I recommend this product to everybody interested in trying out a great (and pretty spiffy) new razor!!</li>
    <li> Received Fusion ProGlide Razor with Flexball recently.  This razor provided a close shave and the vibration made for a much easier shave.  Would recommend this for anyone looking to use a non-electric razor. Not sure that the &amp;#34;Flexball&amp;#34; technology added a lot to the shaving process however.</li>
    <li> I received the Fusion Proglide Razor with Flexball Handle from Gillette to test and review.  As I&#x27;ve come expect with Gillette&#x27;s products, the shave is close and comfortable.  My skin, which is sensitive and has been subject to irritation with other razors, was completely irritation free with the Proglide.  The Flexball was an interesting twist - it gave me better control of the direction of my shave, something that resulted in less shaving over the same area of my face.  My only complaint is the size of the handle.  I understand that the batteries have to go somewhere, but I find the width of the handle very hard to grip.  At times I found myself fumbling just to keep the razor in my hand.  I&#x27;m still using it and I hope to find a satisfactory way to hold it because the shave is outstanding.</li>
    <li> After using the Gillette Fusion Pro Glide with flex ball for a few weeks now, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it. I have had to use an electric razor for the past 13 years because every time I tried a different kind of razor I ended up with terrible razor burn and a less than smooth face.  Since using this razor I have been very pleased with my shave, smooth and no razor burn!  Not every product works well for ever person I know, but after years of searching I have finally found a razor that is a perfect fit for me.</li>
    <li> Was sent this product top review and I loved this razor, at first I didn&#x27;t understand the little orange basketball little thingy but I quickly caught on. It helps to maneuver the razor around the nooks and crannies. It also provided and very close shave. I will purchase, thanks gillette for my opportunity to review your product.</li>
    <li> Every other day I have to shave not only myself, but my disabled son, razors are a pain in the neck, usually cut him and pull hair.  I don&#x27;t even use razors anymore, I have opted to use hair trimmers.  I tried this razor on myself and my son and it follows the contour of your face, shaving all the hair the first time over, you don&#x27;t have to keep scraping over the same hair trying to get it to shave.  Very nice!!! Best razor Ive ever used, I recommend it to everyone!</li>
    <li> Here is my analysis and test results for the new Gillette &amp;#34;Flexball&amp;#34; razor:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▲ The razor comes with a very handy stand to hold while not being used. Fits well, stays put. The razor is very hefty--about 1.8 oz measured on my scale. By contrast, a disposable typically weighs-in less than 1 oz. I measured a Gillette disposable at 1/2 oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▲ The razor body is very solid, and has a comfortable feel to it. I liked the feel of the razor body--it felt solidly constructed, and is also well-balanced. I also liked the black raised ergonomic contours on the body of the razor. Again--felt very solid and well constructed. The color of the body is black with silver trim, plus the orange Flexball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▲ For &amp;#34;Field Test #1,&amp;#34; I did not shave for several days, so that I had a 3-day beard. I washed my face with cool water, left my face wet, then applied a smooth layer of the Proglide gel. I then waited several minutes for my beard to soften. I began shaving in the easier portions of my face, where the whiskers are lighter, then proceeded to the heavier sections around my chin. The razor nicely navigated all the crags and contours without the slightest drag or snagging. The blades cut very close without the hint of scraping or cutting. I examined my face very closely after shaving, and I was very pleased with the result. The razor did an outstanding job, providing a very close, clean shave. (For the records, I do NOT have a really smooth face--it&#x27;s about normal roughness.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▲ For &amp;#34;Field Test #2,&amp;#34; I had just the normal 1-day beard. I washed my face with warm water, left my face wet, then similarly applied a layer of the same gel. I waited exactly 3 1/2 minutes for the bristles to soften. This time, I paid attention to how well the razor traversed over the chin and down to the neck. I wanted to see if the rotating head of the razor could smoothly navigate this hilly territory. As before the razor did a similarly outstanding job, providing a very close and smooth shave. Thus, both the Field Tests confirm the capability of this product. It works as advertised. When I completed my shaving, I rinsed the razor, and noticed that it is somewhat difficult to get the blades entirely clean of shaving gel. With 5 blades closely spaced together, this is not a trivial feat. After cleaning, I thoroughly dried the cartridge, as I hope to extend the life of the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▲ The famous &amp;#34;Flexball&amp;#34; is obvious because of its bright orange color. The Flexball pivots in 2 different ways. As you hold the razor in front of you, it pivots left to right, in an angular fashion--perhaps up to 15 degrees in each direction. There are little &amp;#34;stops&amp;#34; on the Flexball that prevent it from rotating too far. You can see a very fine band (at first I thought it was a wire) that allows the angular pivoting. This movement is very smooth--no hitches whatsoever. There is a small screw-like pivot-point, around which the movement takes place. This fastener appears to be very solid; I doubt anything will come lose. The head of the razor also pivots forward and back, using a thin &amp;#34;bar&amp;#34; going into the head of the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▲ The above Flexball is very impressive engineering. It appears to operate flawlessly. All of this is to allow the razor to match the contours of your face. That&#x27;s a nice way of saying, shave around all those divots and dents in your face (not that YOU have any, of course, but someone else might.) To further get around those slight detours, this product uses extremely thin, five blades that are designed to glide more smoothly; thus, there is no tugging on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▲ Gillette also claims to incorporate a proprietary strip called the &amp;#34;Enhanced Lubrastrip.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s the part of the cartridge that is pale green. This strip contains mineral oil and &amp;#34;lubricating polymers.&amp;#34; Well, my skin appreciated those &amp;#34;polymers.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;✔ SUMMARY: My shaving &amp;#34;test&amp;#34; passed with flying colors. My shave was very smooth, very close, no tugs, no snags. The razor feels very solid. One possible caveat--the razor itself, and the replacement blades are not cheap compared to other products. However, it seems unfair to lower the rating because of the cost; the shopper can make their own decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;♫ A Review by Chris LawsonY: My shaving &amp;#34;test&amp;#34; passed with flying colors.

    <li> I Am in love with this shaver i got it from bzzagent campaign and its awesome. Happy to have it. #GotItFree</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really shave. I don&#x27;t like the idea of nicking myself. I do get my hair cut though. I just go to a barbershop and they do it. SO when they brought this in I wasn&#x27;t sure how much nicer it was going to be.&lt;br /&gt;Turned out it&#x27;s pretty good. You can actually get a fairly safe and nice shave from it. Cuts the hair very cleanly and if you so desired. You don&#x27;t have to break out the shaving cream. You don&#x27;t have to just shave the face either. You can shave the pits or the arms and even the legs!&lt;br /&gt;It has a battery function (never figured out how to replace it). I didn&#x27;t care for that as much I thought it didn&#x27;t add much to the product and it seemed like the vibration might hurt the precision of your shaves but that&#x27;s not mandatory to have on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yeah. Nice product.</li>
    <li> This razor is ultra nice. I received my razor free from Gillette. A close shave has never been easier with the FlexBall technology. This razor goes everywhere you need it to with ease. It looks like a $100 razor and works just as good as one. The blades are awesome but not really any different than other razor blades or razors. Not really sure why this razor has a battery or needs one for that matter. I can shave just as well without turning it on as I can with it on. Nice razor. Im pleased. Wife is happy. Would definitely recommend</li>
    <li> Product as listed.  Prompt shipping</li>
    <li> Wow what an improvement to daily shaving. I received a sample from the Gillette and will never go back to my old razar. The gliding action makes shaving easier then ever before. The razar contours to your face so no more hard to reach areas which reduces accidental cuts. The price is a little higher then the normal razor but it is well worth it.</li>
    <li> I received a free Fusion ProGlide Power FlexBall from Gillette to try. I currently own a Fusion ProGlide manual razor but use the power blades. First, the shave I get from the ProGlide blades is unmatched. Expensive, but unmatched. I use the power blades because they have the MicroComb channel that I believe makes a huge difference. Second, the FlexBall is great. It truly is a game-changer. The blades are always perfectly on your face no matter what angle or direction you are shaving at. I couldn&#x27;t believe how much better this seemingly simple change made my shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why 4 stars instead of 5: the power razor handle. Don&#x27;t understand it. Don&#x27;t like it. Unnecessary. The &amp;#34;power&amp;#34; i.e. vibrations do nothing for me. In fact, Gillette provides NO literature about the power function on the handle whatsoever. Probably because they have been challenged by their competitors on it since they introduced the power razor and have proven that is actually doesn&#x27;t do anything. So why not just not turn it on? The problem with that is the power handle is significantly more bulky and at the same time lighter than the manual handle making it much harder to work with and flip/move around vs. the manual (which is great by the way). Also, the holder for the razor requires you to sore the razor lying flat vs. standing up with a regular Fusion razor. I have a Fusion and have my limited bathroom space arranged to accommodate my standing up razor. Switching to a horizontal setup is certainly not ideal and a pain. Why not just use the old holder? Doesn&#x27;t fit because of the FlexBall handle design. I&#x27;m guessing they cut out the full holder to keep costs down for the higher costing FlexBall addition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: do your face a favor and buy yourself a manual (non-power) Fusion handle with FlexBall. The FlexBall is excellent and you will notice the difference as it contours to your face like nothing before especially if you shave with anything less than Fusion today. Theblades are ~$4 a pop anyway so when you buy a FlexBall handle for ~$9, you are really only paying $5 for the handle upgrade because it comes with a razor on it.</li>
    <li> I loved using the Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall handle technology. The way the blades glide across my face was realy amazing. I love the way the head rotates in different directions. I also like how the blades vibrate. Overall this is a great shaver.</li>
    <li> i like it,not expensive!!</li>
    <li> Does what I wanted -- close shave</li>
    <li> I received a Gillette Fusion Proglide for free from Gillette.  I have used a electric razor for years, but from time to time I like to use a blade razor for the close, clean shave you just can&#x27;t quite get from a electric.  I was pleasantly surprised with this razor, as to the ball movement allowing the razor to follow the contours of my face more effectively, the power movement eliminating razor bumps and irritation, and the number of blades seemed to really cut back on the number of passes needed.  I would definitely recommend this razor to anyone looking for a new one with comfort in mind.  I know this will be kept in my razor collection for many years, and will be my go to when I am looking for that clean shave.</li>
    <li> I really love my new  Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall handle.  I have been using Gillette Fusion for a number of years with great satisfaction, but the flex handle allows me to shave much faster, and get everything in one pass!  And...Love the Vibration!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, especially on my neck.  This razor I got from Gillette is perfect!  A close shave in one stroke.  I don&#x27;t think I have ever used a razor that cut as smoothly as this one does.  The flexball allows the razor to stay in contact with my skin even when going over my jawline and other curved areas.</li>
    <li> I received this from Gillette and I used it for almost 2 month and after that, I can say that this new razor works very good and I like that I can use the old blades.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely, I&#x27;ll continue using this new razor.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try the Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall handle technology when Gillette sent it to me as I’ve been using the Fusion ProGlide Power since it came out. It didn’t disappoint. It’s got all the features I’ve come to love about the Fusion series of razors, the aloe strip, multiple blades, the single blade for tight lines, but now the pivot head has been added for ease in shaving the jaw lines. It works just as advertised in keeping a more constant contact with your face and eliminating a few strokes when you shave. For sensitive skin like mine, I’ll take that any time I can get it. The handle will connect to any of the Fusion Proglide heads so I’d recommend the purchase to anyone, even if you still have blades left from a previous razor.</li>
    <li> The new FlexBall razor from Gillette make me want to never go back to an electric razor again!  Gillette outdid themselves on this one and my shaving time has been greatly reduced since using this new razor.  For those on the fence, do yourself a favor and make this your next purchase at the store.  Your wives and girlfriends will thank you later!</li>
    <li> To start this review, I would like to disclose that I received the product free to review from Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;t took me a while to get used to using a new razor (I usually use a Mach3), and it was very sharp and actually cut my neck up quite a bit.  It appears to have 5 blades, as opposed to the 3 i am used to using.  I like the packaging - it took up less space than my other razor.  I didn&#x27;t really see the benefits of the flex ball, it still missed the spots that i used to miss with my Mach3.  I will continue to use this razor and see how it performs going forward.</li>
    <li> I love this arzor it moves arounf my face well and i have yet to cut myself with it..... well worth it :)</li>
    <li> Okay, so this is a very good razor and I will continue to use it. However, I did not notice that much of an improvement performance-wise from the Fusion Proglide Power Razor (without the Flexball Feature). It just does not seem to shave any closer or really have any extra benefits that makes it truly stand out, and in my opinion, the marketing of this specific razor is just way too much and could even be an overkill…but really, it works just as good as any other power razor by Gillette. I would give this product a try guys, but don&#x27;t expect it to be some &amp;#34;super&amp;#34; razor that is just going to get rid of irritation, cuts, redness, etc… It&#x27;s all in the prep prior to shaving, not the razor itself….Overall — 3/5 stars — OK product — just because I did not notice any substantial improvements in the shave…performs the same as any other power razor….I will not be falling for anymore marketing/ads from Gillette, since the quality seems to be the same from product-to-product lately…</li>
    <li> Really good razor, gives a good shave.  My wife used it since some women say men&#x27;s razors do a better job.  She isn&#x27;t sure what the vibration function was for though.</li>
    <li> I have tried the other offerings by Gillette since the Mach 3.  None have been good enough for me to ditch my Mach 3...until the ProGlide Power.  Now I have been fortunate enough to be able to test the Gillette Fusion Powered Proglide with ROLLERBALL for free.  I am very impressed.  I am a lazy shaver and usually only shave once a week.  Wife hounds me and I eventually give in.  So my beard is always pretty rough each time I shave.  The proglide is very good but the added Rollerball is excellent!  I never thought is give up my Mach 3, then the proglide power.  Never say never!  I recommend  to anyone who wants a closer, easier shave.</li>
    <li> I am not gifted with the privilege of being able to grow a full beard which means that when I shave my face gets irritated very easily. That being said, I experienced no irritation while trying out the Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall and still got a smooth, close shave. The first time I tried it out I used the vibrating handle which for some reason gave me a sense of urgency and made me shave unusually fast which produced some sort of irritation, so for my subsequent shaves I decided to do without the vibration. The FlexBall was able to reach every contour of my face and the precision edge blade allowed me to shave very close to my sideburns. All-in-all I am extremely satisfied with this razor.</li>
    <li> I recently received the latest model razor from Gillette to test out and I was quite impressed with it.  The Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor has a rotating head that makes shaving difficult spots easier.  This model also includes a battery with led indicator and vibration.  The vibration seems to help provide an even closer shave and the battery adds a nice weight to the razor.  Overall I would recommend the Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor with Flexball Handle to anyone who is looking for a faster and closer shave.</li>
    <li> I replaced my Mach 3 with this Proglide Razor that I received from Gillette.  I must admit I was hesitant to replace my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; razor but I figured it was time to give something else a chance.  I am sure glad I did.  This razor and its 5 blades gave me the closet shave i have ever had with zero irritation.  I also loved the addition of the precision trimmer.  That worked well with my beard / mustache. The Flexball technology was feature I wasn&#x27;t sure about when I first got it but it really works.  It helps keep everything even.</li>
    <li> This razor was very comfortable to use. Not only for me, but my wife has confiscated it!! It gave a very close shave after a long weekend of being lazy...</li>
    <li> This razor is amazing. It leaves my skin feeling so soft and fresh. I have very sensitive skin and tend to break out every time I shave but with this razor none of that happened. I loved that it has so many blades. I was able to shave in half the amount of time than with and ordinary razor. I am definitely going to keep buying this razor it&#x27;s amazing quality and a great price.</li>
    <li> As a guy who shaves his head regularly i have used many different types of blades and creams. at this point i began to think, what more can they come up with and does it really matter? YES, when shaving my head without the flex ball i used to miss pieces on the side of my head and now its 1 smooth stroke. when gilette sent this to me to try out i was skeptical but i was wrong. i have already recommended this to a few other people who shave their head and now my girl used this for her legs (got her own). a really phenomenal product</li>
    <li> Upon first getting the Gillette Fusion ProGlide SilverTouch Power Razor from Gillette, the razor seemed to dry my skin and took double the time to shave. After waiting a couple of days, the razor was tried again. This time the razor seemed to work fine, yet it was only shaving stubble. Overall opinion, this razor is fine for stubble but for anything else a regular razor will do. Also without the power on, the razor will not work---it feels as though the skin is dry.</li>
    <li> Disclaimer: Received as part of a promotion from the manufacturer so price was not a factor in my review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely amazing product, I have been shaving with cheap disposable razors for years and had never tried a product like this before. I was quite impressed, I could actually notice that the shave was much closer to the skin, but at the same time it did not hurt my normally sensitive skin. Will definitely consider purchasing replacement razors in the future.</li>
    <li> When I seen that Gillette was coming out with yet ANOTHER razor I was skeptical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a shave daily guy, however the biggest take away of this new razor is it&#x27;s FAST, and CLEAN!  I can easily shave in a hurry, half awake in the mornings!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t really notice the new technology until you actually use it.  But when you do... WOW, It really is a new razor from Gillette! Worth the less then $10 price you pay absolutely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your skeptical try it, it&#x27;s worth the affordable price!</li>
    <li> I have to say without a doubt this is the fastest shave I have EVER had.  I have been using a Schick Hydra 5 for the extra moisturizing it offers and the &amp;#34;power&amp;#34; option as well.  I was pleasantly surprised when I picked up this Gillette and gave it a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now let&#x27;s talk about the things I liked about the razor.  The long handle fits very well in your hand.  I&#x27;m not a huge person but, I have long fingers so holding on to it was very easy and very comfortable which I did not expect at first.  The grip itself was very sure so to speak.  It didn&#x27;t feel like it was going to flop around or slip at all.  The power vibration option is very well needed for me as well.  I grow very little facial hair so I can easily go a month without shaving.  However, what does grow curls very badly.  This completely cut down on snags and pulling.  The razor head itself threw me for a loop as I watched it move.  This thing moves much like the Dyson vacuum that rides on a ball.  It swivels easily about and never seems to lose contact with your face. The blade head also folds easily to ninety degrees if not more so you can use very long and proper strokes.  I also normally need to go back over between my jaw and chin a time or two to get the stray hairs.  That was completely unnecessary but, done solely out of habit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, I do have a few things I was not pleased about with the razor.  As mentioned I use the Hydra 5 due to the extra moisturizing available from the razor.  That is a feature I miss sorely right now.  My face is definitely tingling more than normal after using this razor because of it.  I always have to endure some degree of razor burn so it is expected.  This is just a bit more uncomfortable than the norm.  Also, due to the lack of hair along my neck I enjoy the variable power option from the Hydra 5.  This doesn&#x27;t have that either.  I like to turn it down as it&#x27;s not much to fight with.  I was disappointed with the basic off and on functionality in this case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all this is a great razor.  It gave a very quick and close shave with little to no effort at all.  Again, the blades always kept contact and not once felt unsure or unsteady.  But, be aware if you have sensitive skin you&#x27;re are going to want to get the extra moisturizing cream or gel and apply your after shave lotion liberally.n this case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all this is a great razor.

    <li> Purchased Proglide Power on sale at big box Retailer but wanted to share my experience here in the hopes it will help others.  Wanted to love it but, sadly, one of the worst shaves I ever had.  Don&#x27;t understand all the &amp;#34;best shave ever&amp;#34; reviews.  My experience was different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick whiskers and do not have sensitive skin.  I have found that, whatever razor I use, I need to shave &amp;#34;up&amp;#34; against the grain in order to get a close shave. The Flexball on this razor causes head to skitter back and forth if used in this manner resulting in patches of stubble and gouges.  I tried shaving down with the grain first and letting the razor do the work but, shave was not close enough and found the Flexball caused patches of longer stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have mustache whiskers that grow up to where my nose meets my face.  Impossible to get a close shave in that area with this razor design.  About 1/4inch between the leading/trailing edge and first cutting blade on head means a bush of whiskers left under nose.  I tried shaving up under nose but head travels behind handle and, although handle pivots out, spring on head wants to pull flat with handle.  Significant pressure is required in order to keep head in contact face when handle pivoted outward resulting in cuts from one of the 5 blades whose plane is violated by the curvature of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found no difference between using this razor with the power on vs with power off (like regular Proglide).  Of all the gimmicks this razor has, I thought the Power feature had the most promise.  Sadly, had the same issues both ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this razor left me with patchy stubble and nicks/cuts. I&#x27;m going back to the fully manual Gillette Sensor which truly gave me the best shave.</li>
    <li> Excellent shave from this new product.  Definitely worth a try.  Much better than others I have tried.  Have used a few times with no skin irritation and closest shave in a long time!</li>
    <li> Gillette does it again. Great product.</li>
    <li> I received this as a sample from Gillette and have been using it a few weeks. Great razor &amp; great shave. It seems to be a much closer shave than the typical disposable and the flexball handle makes it very comfortable.</li>
    <li> Great price for a great razor</li>
    <li> Smooth, but works perfectly!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been a guy who shaves much, mainly because I hate the chore of shaving, but after receiving the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Razor with Flexball through a promotion by Gillette, I began to like shaving a little more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was wary of the Flexball at first, but I had no problems using the razor with it, in fact it seemed to make navigating the uneven surface of my face easier, resulting in a closer shave with less need to pass over an area more than once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I don&#x27;t grow facial hair that quickly I only need to shave about every other day. So I&#x27;m not sure how long the blade will last me, but it&#x27;s still pretty sharp.  Not as sharp as it was when I received it a month ago, but pretty sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t see a difference between a shave with the vibrations on vs off.  I&#x27;m not really sure what that is supposed to do, I&#x27;ve never had a razor with that before, but it doesn&#x27;t hinder shaving if you turn it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;d rate this razor as the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  It consistently gives a very close shave, and I think the Flexball has a lot to do with that.  I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone out there looking for a close shave with minimal effort needed</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll be the first to admit that I&#x27;m cheap when it comes to buying razors.  I generally avoid the big &amp;#34;name&amp;#34; razors, out of fear that I&#x27;ll (1) not appreciate the difference in shave vs. the difference in price or (2) enjoy the razor enough that I&#x27;ll be stuck paying more for replacement cartridges that I have to replace all too frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a Gillette Proglide Razor with the Flexball (the powered version) through a promotion by Gillette.  A wanted to use this razor for about a month before I could give an accurate review (I occasionally use blades for that long).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shave - the shave that this razor gets is the best I&#x27;ve ever tried.  The roller ball took a day or two to get used to (the movement is great once you get a hang of it, but is different from others I&#x27;d tried), but turned out to be a major benefit.  The razor was able to give a close shave on the first pass, and didn&#x27;t need multiple passes to handle some of the harder angles (chin, jawline).  A very close shave to boot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Durability - as noted above, I used this razor for almost a month.  I shave daily, occasionally skipping a day, and this razor lasted the month.  After about 2 weeks, it became apparent that the shave wasn&#x27;t as smooth as when the blade was new, but it was not uncomfortable.  However, by the end of the month, the last shave or two began to have that uncomfortable feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Power - I have never found much of a benefit using the power models of razors.  In fact, I often find them to be a hindrance, as the vibration of the blades makes it harder to shave in tight areas.  While I don&#x27;t feel like the vibrations on this razor helped a lot, at least they weren&#x27;t so forceful as to make shaving more difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great razor, and one for which I&#x27;ll be buying replacement blades.</li>
    <li> I received a Fusion Proglide from Gillette, for free. I love this razor. Not only does it give me a nice clean and close shave, but this razor travels well also. Attached is a small over that protects the blades and keeps the razor small enough to easily pack. Good for the man on the go. I recommend anytime. . .</li>
    <li> I received this razor from Gillette as a trial.  I&#x27;ve used a mach3 for years as my go-to razer in the shower. I like this one better but I haven&#x27;t researched the replacement/blade cost. If the up-charge is reasonable, I&#x27;ll continue to use this.</li>
    <li> I used this razor on my legs, and was impressed with the performance. It was smooth and close. Only 1 star off because I couldn&#x27;t feel the contours of my knees and ankles as well when the power was turned on, which made me nervous that I would nick my skin. I ended up turning the power off for those areas. I liked the pivoting action, it seemed to hug the curves nicely!</li>
    <li> Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch Power Men&#x27;s Razor with Flexball Handle was sent to me to try for free.  It&#x27;s a good razor, but at first use, it really had issues with missing patches of hair on my face.  With a week&#x27;s worth of stubble, I&#x27;d have to go over places on my jaw two or three times to get it all.  I really expected better, but after a few uses, even with the same amount of stubble, it works just fine now.  Go figure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nice and quiet when you use the power option as well, which is always a plus!  The head is supposed to pivot so that you can get every hair... I don&#x27;t know if that happens or not.  Like I mentioned, it definitely didn&#x27;t work that way the first time, but now the razor is as good as others I have used.  Not better, but as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a nice razor, it isn&#x27;t earth shattering, but I think you&#x27;ll be pleased with it.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor with Flexball Handle from Gillette for free to try out against my facial hair that needs to be shaved at least every other day in exchange for a review.  I&#x27;ve always used razors with multiple blades in order to get the closest cut, but unlike some of my friends, I always cut against the grain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I&#x27;ve noticed with other razors when cutting against the grain is that unless I move my hand/arm in a steady position while cutting against the grain, I will most likely walk away with a few nicks here and there and will need to apply the \\&quot;razor cut band-aids\\&quot; of toilet paper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I don&#x27;t claim to have a steady hand, the Flexball Handle did the hard part for me.  It was actually flexible enough to twist and turn the razor head while I moved the handle in an upward motion that wasn&#x27;t necessarily straight.  What I was most impressed with was the fact that I only needed to swipe upwards against the grain once and didn&#x27;t have to go over it multiple times like I used to do in order to catch what I had intended to cut, but missed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The longevity of the razor was impressive too.  Not only do I shave my face, but I also shave my head.  By using the same razor for my head and face, I typically cycle through a razor after only 2-3 shaves before I start feeling the dullness of the blade.  But, the Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor lasted beyond the 2-3 shaves and increased it to 3-5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t like spending a lot of time having to shave and you&#x27;ve often found yourself going over the same area with a razor in order to get everything, you definitely need to try the Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor with Flexball Technology blade.  Shaving is made simple and will only require you to shave over the area once with and against the grain to get the smoothest, closest shave.</li>
    <li> very smooth shave, and the vibration is good for little nubs.  I usually &amp;#34;dry shave&amp;#34; and have yet to get a nick!&lt;br /&gt;great product, I recommend</li>
    <li> This shaver does everything it promises. It is the most comfortable shaveer I&#x27;ve used.  I like the fact that it dies not nick my sensitive skin. I recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Please note that this review was contributed my my husband, who shaves his face, as I do not. The flexball adds countouring ability that makes the shave even closer on those really hard-to-shave areas. I can pretty much get away with just one pass with this razor, something I absolutely could not do with other blades. Leaves my skin smooth and hardly ever nicks.</li>
    <li> I really love this Proglide. It&#x27;s actually the best one I&#x27;ve ever used. The flex ball is what get&#x27;s my attention most because the razor can literally move around easily.</li>
    <li> Love the new razor. Meets expectations.</li>
    <li> When I saw my disabled neighbor with cuts on his face from shaving, I knew he needed a new razor. When I saw this one, I decided to give it a try. He was agreeable, so I opted to shave him myself rather than see him struggle and fret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were both surprised how it fit the contours of his face and how easy it was for me to shave him. That&#x27;s not a chore I had ever tried before, so was rather leery. But I need not have feared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make a long story short, after seeing how easy it was for me to shave him, he tried it himself and is one-hundred percent happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, flexball technology really works and I recommend this product heartily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reviewed by Betty Dravis, July 20, 2014&lt;br /&gt;Author of &amp;#34;Six-Pack of Fear&amp;#34; (co-author Barbara Watkins)</li>
    <li> I received a free razor from Gillette to test. I am already a fan of Gillette razors, Sensor, Mach 3, Fusion...this is just the next in a line of all around good razors.  The flexball handle feels a bit delicate, but works great at providing close contact with the blade to give a close, smooth shave without cuts.  You kind of have to take your time a little because it \\&quot;glides\\&quot; but that is a bit of a good thing.  It provides a relaxing shave so your mind can wander a bit if you like.  The razor looks great likje it has a lot of bells and whistles, but it basically a slightly upgraded Fusion.  I like it though and will probably buy another while I wait for the next Gillette innovation.</li>
    <li> When I first got this razor, I was a bit skeptical. It looks fancy and high tech but does it really do that great of a job? Yes, its awesome. I have very sensitive skin and have used this for almost a month and haven&#x27;t broken out, no razor burn either. I love that it flexes in all directions as well, it contours to your face perfectly. Most razors these days, the head flexes but not left and right, that helps make this razor very unique. Plus with the vibration it cuts very close to the skin for a perfectly smooth shave. I would recommend this razor, like others the blades are expensive but it is worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I have used Gillette products in the past but wanted to test the new flexball handle and see if it lived up to it&#x27;s billing. It did deliver as promised and glided over my face in hard to reach curves. It provided a smooth shave and lifted and pulled the hairs ot without pain. I di not notice any pull or tug like with other battery powered or manual razors. I love the closeness it gets to your skin and the Gillette fusion proglide power men&#x27;s razor with the flexball handle moved at new angles that stiff handled razors can not and got into area&#x27;s on my chin and side of my face that I normally can not get with out the flexball handle, Overall I would recommend this product and give it a high mark for close shave.</li>
    <li> I received this product as a sample from Gillette.  I honestly don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;d be anything that I would purchase in the future.  The blades were great and gave me a nice clean/close shave, but the &amp;#34;flexball&amp;#34; feature didn&#x27;t do a whole lot for me.  This didn&#x27;t seem to me to be that much of an improvement from what I have been using.</li>
    <li> Most of these Gillette razors seem identical to me. They are very good razors for shaving shorter hair, especially if you shave to keep a clean shave look. The razor is still somewhat sharp, and I have used it 4 times a week. I have been using it to see what kind of wear and tear I can get out of it, and it is still holding up. The flexball handle is pretty cool when you play with it, and feels like a normal razor when you are using it. I am unable to notice any difference from Gillette razors I have used in the past. All in all, this is a good economical razor that will give you the close shave you want. I have always preferred Gillette and recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I picked up this razor after comparing it to all the others on the shelf.  I have been an electric razor user since my teens but I give a manual razor a try every now and then.  Upon first opening the razor I was impressed on how well it was made. It was rather heavy and not some cheap flimsy plastic thing that will break.  The head is very easy to install and/ replace.  Unfortunately all we had in the house was my wife&#x27;s leg shaving cream but I used it anyways. The razor felt good on the skin and did not get hung up on even some longer hair.  It left a smooth finish but still some hairs visible to the eye.  I didnt really notice the &amp;#34;Flexball&amp;#34; feature coming into play much; however as I said I come from the electric razor world and not a blade one.</li>
    <li> I tried the new Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor with flexible handle technology when they sent me one to sample, and all I can say is, &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34;  what a great shave!  I don&#x27;t have an angular face so I can&#x27;t really tell if the new fangled handle makes a difference on other types of faces, but the system works great for my egg shaped face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only other experience getting a super close shave is when I get a shave with a straight razor at the hair place I visit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My old standby had been a Gillette Mach 3 turbo for many years.  I always thought three blades was enough for my face and didn&#x27;t see any point in going for the new fangled 5 blade systems.  Now I&#x27;m happy to say I was wrong.</li>
    <li> I once believed all razors were basically equal.  I now know better. The Fusion ProGlide Power with FlexBall Handle gave me an amazingly quick and clean shave.  I shave my head and face so I use a razor a fair amount.  I found using this razor not only gave me a great and nick free shave but shortens the time I spend shaving, and that is amazing.  The vibrating razor seems to quicken the time it takes to complete my shave, one or two passes and I am baby smooth.  I love this razor and will definitely stick with it.</li>
    <li> I was glad to be trying a razor as a free sample.  I am in the military so I have to shave every day which gets expensive.  This Fusion ProGlide razor with the flexball provided a great, close shave.  I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily say that it was noticeably different from any of the other Fusion razors though.  They are great razors overall but I feel like the &amp;#34;different&amp;#34; razors that they come out with are just to make more money having people buy more to try them out.  They don&#x27;t really perform any differently.  The flexball (or the power option for that matter) did not add noticeable changes for me.The cost is also very high.  Again, the razor is excellent (as all other Fusion razors are in my opinion), I just don&#x27;t know if they are really worth their cost to me except when they are on sale.  If you are looking for the best shave regardless of the price, the Fusion line overall is the best.</li>
    <li> Ok. I am always skeptical when it comes to new razors.I have sensitive skin and dread shaving because of the itching and the razor doesn&#x27;t give a close enough shave so I tend to go over the same area several times and my face is aggravated by the shave. I AM A FIRM BELIEVER IN THE GILLETTE FUSION PROGLIDE SILVERTOUCH POWER!!!!!! This razor left me with a very close shave and no razor burn. NO MORE CONFUSION WITH THE GILLETTE FUSION !!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide SilverTouch Power Razor from Gillette to try out. I&#x27;m a huge fan of my Mach 3 Turbo but I tried the new Proglide Flexball because I was curious to see which one was better. After trying both of them, I discovered that the new Proglide razor is bulkier. However, it definitely shaved closer than any shaver I&#x27;ve used before. In any case, I still like both razors. The Mach 3 is hard to beat but I&#x27;m might slowly transition to the Flexball because it cuts closer and doesn&#x27;t take more than one stroke in each direction. Give a try for sure! Who knows, you may do what I did -- keep one at home and the other in the gym bag.</li>
    <li> Best Shave I ever had.  Been shaving for the better part of four decades and this is the best razor I ever used.</li>
    <li> i got the GILLETTE FUSION PROGLIDE SILVERTOUCH POWER RAZOR form buzzagent and i love the GILLETTE FUSION PROGLIDE SILVERTOUCH POWER RAZOR i works good i reLLY LOVE IT</li>
    <li> I have tried to use 5 bladed razors before but ended up just using a single blade cuz the others sucked, but that all changed with this razor!!!! I received the Fusion Proglide from Gillette and have been using it ever since.  This is an absolutely amazing razor.  I have not gotten anytype of razor burn or bumps like with my old ones.  It gives an amazingly close shave.  I have very thick curly hair (i&#x27;m italian) but it cut through with one swipe.  The flexball makes it easier to shave under myneck and does not give me any knicks. It makes it easy to reach tight corners without any problems.  My new favorite razor!!!&lt;br /&gt;(Matthew Fazzio {used wife&#x27;s account lol})</li>
    <li> I have shaved my face with this razor i received from Gillette and I&#x27;ve used lots of different razors this one did great. My current favorite method is the old fashion straight razor this one is better. When I first opened the Razor Proglide I thought It looked great.The first day I shaved with it I realized it was great.I was interested in the electric vibration that it uses.It actually does help it glide across my face.I tried it with the device turned on and then with it turned off.leave it on.</li>
    <li> OK, so, I bought this for my boyfriend. I don&#x27;t know how he feels about it, honestly. But I used this today to shave my legs (w/o his knowledge, shh, don&#x27;t tell him) and I freaking LOVE this razor. SO quick to shave, clean, smooth cut, NO KNICKS and it moves around your knee/ankle easily &#x27;cause of the pivot head. I think I&#x27;ll be tossing my &amp;#34;lady razors&amp;#34; and getting one of these for myself.</li>
    <li> Gillette has a winner with this Proglide Silvertouch and the regular Proglide. The Silvertouch refers to the chrome finish. Though it seems gimmicky, this is absolutely the best shave I have ever had. I can recommend it highly. Keep in mind though replacement blades run about 4 dollars a piece, which is not unusual in this day and age.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall handle technology that I received from Gillette for a free trial for about two weeks now. I was thinking that this was just marketing hype. Would it be any different than the Fusion ProGlide razor that I normally use? The regular Fusion ProGlide gives a very close, very comfortable shave, however my only complaint it that it feels clunky to use, more like rubbing an oar over your face than controlled shaving. This new Flexball seems to have addressed this issue. The orange Flexball does indeed allow the razor to pivot very easily in all directions. Changing directions around the chin and jaw are more comfortable than before. It may be guilding the lily but the update does make shaving even more comfortable. The replacement cartridges are still quite expensive though.</li>
    <li> I must admit I really like the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power shaver. Close smooth shave, moves very well with the skin and the vibration makes it a more comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> I received this kit from Gillette for free so that I could review it.  This is the first time i have ever tested out a product to review and I hope it does this product justice.  I wanted to make sure it was a product that I would want to invest money in and I have to say, I love this razor!  The Fusion ProGlide Power with the new FlexBall Handle really allows this razor to adjust to the contours of your face.  For me personally, this comes in handy, because being right handed I always have a hard time getting the right angle on the left side of my face.  It has also been some time since I used a razor that vibrates and I forgot how it does actually help me to get a closer shave.  I can say this, because I have been using the Gillette Fusion for about 3 years now and this was a stark contrast in the closeness of my shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Can use same cartridges as the Fusion(if you have extra)&lt;br /&gt;Vibrates for closer shave&lt;br /&gt;Flexball handle actually works&lt;br /&gt;Microcomb does a great job channeling hair&lt;br /&gt;Blades cut better which means less time irritating your face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;I was just a little disappointed that it did not come with an extra blade&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all this really is a great razor that I would recommend to anybody seeking a more ergonomic and better functioning razor!</li>
    <li> The new Flexball razor provided a shave that was incrementally better than the original Fusion. Overall it felt very similar to using the standard Fusion, which was the best razor that I had used up until that point. But where the Flexball was able to improve was around the jawline and the transitions around the chin. Because of the swivel it was able to keep the entire razor in contact with my skin at all times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So while it isn&#x27;t a totally different shaving experience from the original Fusion, it does provide some very interesting improvements that helps keep the Fusion line of razors ahead of the competition.</li>
    <li> qood quality. NICE!!!</li>
    <li> As advertised, a) the FlexBall Handle Technology contoured to my face&#x27;s shape, b) thePrecision Trimmer was perfect for edging, and I barely felt the razor gliding on my face thanks to the Micropulses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product from Gillette and used it with the Fusion ProGlide Sensitive Shave Gel (purchased by me).</li>
    <li> Awesome product. I didn&#x27;t think I would use another razor again but Gillette sent me this and I figured I&#x27;d give it another try. .wow what a product. I&#x27;m the hubby btw LOL.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it. It shaves close like he likes it and glides well. He recommends it.</li>
    <li> It does everything Gillette says it will.</li>
    <li> i really enjoyed this razor. it worked better than i anticipated. i recommend this razor for all to try</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power with the NEW Flex Ball Handle is better than I thought it would be. When I received my free razor from Gillette I thought it was just another gimmick but to my surprise. Very close shave no nicks or cuts. Now instead of shaving every other day and can skip a couple of days.</li>
    <li> Not sure this gives you any closer shave than any other razor but I am bald and thought this would be a better shave for my head whic it is as it moves with my head shape but its nothing revolutionary. Just a nice gimmick and change of pace from my other razors which are  older</li>
    <li> This works well. The ball function does allow for better control on neck and chin. Is this a gimmick? Maybe but I like it and use it.&lt;br /&gt;It would be a gimmick if they would have designed a special razor to go with it...they did not.</li>
    <li> This review is for: Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch Power Men&#x27;s Razor With Flexball Handle Technology With 1 Razor Blade (Health and Beauty)    I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch Power Men&#x27;s Razor With Flexball Handle Technology With 1 Razor Blade from Gillette to try out and share my opinion.     I DO like the Flexball Pivoting Head.  I DONT like the blade, it is too wide  The Vibration doesn&#x27;t make much difference.  Cost of refill blades is 2x more than the ones I have been using.    For years I have used the Gillette Mach III and will go back to using this razor.</li>
    <li> Gillette sent me the Fusion Proglide Silvertouch Power for free to review. I have used the razor several times and overall I would say that the razor is a decent razor. I do not think that the battery feature of this razor added nor took anything away from the shave. So the power part of this razor was kind of a waste of a battery. With the razor turned on I found that it caused me to get razor burn easier. When I shaved with the razor off it was just an average shave. In the end this razor was not good enough for me to want to change and buy this razor.</li>
    <li> I have to admit I was very skeptical about this new Gillette Fusion Proglide with the Flexball… In fact, I have been mainly sticking to using Gillette’s Mach3 since its introduction in the late 90’s. If it isn’t broke don’t fix it and having dealt over the past 16 years of the slight advancements of these multi-blade razors I have not found a more useful advancement like this one…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More blades? &#x3D; More $$$ - 3 blades works just fine!&lt;br /&gt;Adding water/gel bubbles around the shavehead? &#x3D; Makes lathering up ineffective!&lt;br /&gt;Battery powered vibrating feature? &#x3D; Laughable… Give me a break!&lt;br /&gt;…&lt;br /&gt;Pivoting head? &#x3D; Well now… there may be something to this!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After Gillette had me try out their new feature I certainly have hope for this product! Does very well with using on contours of you face, especially around the chin and the other side of you face (left side for me) that is usually harder to see with your peripheral vision in the mirror. Will definitely be upgrading my stock of razors using my new Proglide Flexball!</li>
    <li> this is a good razor.i love how smooth it glides across my neck to my chin.</li>
    <li> I switched to an electric razor years ago. Using a blade always left me with irritated skin and razor burn. I tried using sensitive skin shave cream and the special razors. All to no avail. But I received this Proglide free from Gillette and decided I would give it a try. I must say I was surprised. At first it felt weird as I ran it across my face, it felt as if it was just gliding over my skin. To my surprise as it felt like I was doing nothing it was in fact giving me a smooth shave! Not only did it shave me smooth, but it did it without any razor burn! I have decided to give this razor a go for a little bit and see how it goes. So far I am happy. After giving it a go for a few weeks I am really liking this razor. I may still use the electric razor for daily quick shave, but when I want the smooth shave only a razor can give without razor burn, I have my go to razor now!</li>
    <li> A very convenient way to get household essentials!</li>
    <li> I received a free Flexball razor as part of promotion.  I was really interested to try it because I have been extremely happy with the Fusion Proglide line of razors.  So, on one hand, it was a great shave like I have come to expect.  The flexball part, I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference from any other Fusion Proglide razor.  Bottom line, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this line of razors.</li>
    <li> Recently, I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Razor from Gillette. I was on the lookout for a new razor, when I got this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me just say, when I first used this, it was AMAZING! It is the best razor I&#x27;ve tried so far. It has given me the closest shave of my LIFE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What made be want to buy the product again is the Flexball handle technology. It felt amazing when I was using the razor, and I knew that no other competing brands could come close to this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Razor again :)</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed this razor. Very cool looking, solid, and does a fantastic job. I have been using an electric razor and this swayed me back towards regular razors. It provides a nice close shave just in one swipe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Flexball is a very cool add in some ways but unpractical in others. Lets face it, how many contours does a normal face really have? My face is very straight minus having to shave my jawline. Which is where I will admit this razor does a fantastic job. I usually end up leaving a little stubble around my jawline but somehow the flexball allows it to trail just right to get &amp;#34;virtually every hair&amp;#34;. If you don&#x27;t really have an issue with shaving your jawline then I would recommend the regular Proglide, if you think this could help you I would go with the Flexball. Myself, I would gladly get another Flexball just because, heck, it looks cool.</li>
    <li> This Sci Fi version of a razor looked very much like the previous models. Thick grip, feather light and precision blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The previous razor has the trimmer and multiple blades. The other with the vibrating handle is actually effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t  expect too much since the handle and blade appear to be very similar to previous models(I know I have gone through a few of these myself). The very futuristic look is something I have not been too fond of as I have gotten older but the substantial handle does fit nicely in small or large hands. The blades are crisp and the trimming blade is still a treat to see. That is an innovation that has become a necessity over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for my experience. I didn&#x27;t notice a difference from using my similar Gillette razor blades. THAT WAS PERFECT! This new razor does what it is supposed to and more. The self intuitive device does a great job of cutting close to the skin with little to no irritation. The flex portion does as advertised and I didn&#x27;t notice until I finished shaving that the flex ball had done its job well. I shaved using fewer strokes since I was able to shave from my neck to my cheek without lifting the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use razors on a daily basis and was fortunate to try this razor by receiving a complimentary razor blade set from Gillette. I always feel fresh and crisp after a shave and this was no different. The blade performed well and I finished quicker. Thank you Gillette!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion the design can be updated or a more business option be provided. The blade provided the closest shave I have ever had but it may have contributed the the shorter blade life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from those issues the Gillette family may have another hit on their hands (or cheeks)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
    <li> I received this from Gillette to test out.  I have a full beard and head of hair which are not being cut down in their prime!  However, I have a close friend who must shave for work and also chooses to shave his head.  He&#x27;s impressed, and that is not usually the case.  He refuses to go back to anything else (until the next generation/version of this comes out!).  He loves the close, comfortable shave of his chin and head as well as the ease of shaving.  He was excited to get back to me (so much so that he chose to text and call after the first use).  It&#x27;s a hit and there is one man out there who is loving this product!</li>
    <li> Works really good...no problems at all will buy in the future</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to give this a try.  While it did glide more effortlessly over my face, it did not shave as close as my previous generation fusion power...especially on the flatter parts of my face (sideburn area and lower neck).  In trying to get my neck closer I actually got razor burn which I have not had since I was a kid.  So, sadly, it goes back to Costco.  Too pricey to keep for gadget-sake.  I prefer the comfort and the closer shave that I had been accustomed to...</li>
    <li> I received this razor from #Buzzagent as part of the Proglide campaign. Over all I think that if you have the money to get a proglide then it is a fine razor. The thing will rarely let you down. But it is pricey and I do not think that this particular razor had a profound increase in quality of shave with the flexball. Its a good razor for a slightly high price compared to some of the &amp;#34;Ship to home&amp;#34; razor websites that are very popular now.</li>
    <li> Good razor, cuts clean and smooth, but I find the battery operated vibration makes it easier to cut myself.</li>
    <li> I liked the small profile design and how smooth the shave was without having to go over the same area multiple times, which irritates my skin.  Although it&#x27;s a little more spendy, I think the shave is worth it and it lasts over many more shaves than other brands.</li>
    <li> I received this razor from gillette and was fairly pleased with the product. It shaved very smooth and the 5 blades provided for a tug free shaving experience. I completely shave the little bit of hair that I grow  on my face so I have no need for the trimming blade on the back side of the razor, but I do find it a very good idea. One thing that has fallen by the wayside is the vibrating action. Maybe I am just naive, but I do not quite understand the reason for the vibration. The razor seems to perform just as well with or without the vibrating action. Overall I was pleased with the way this razor felt while shaving and it&#x27;s ability to follow the contour of the face. Quite revolutionary with the with the ball that the razor sits on.</li>
    <li> Excellent shave. The only other better shave I&#x27;ve ever had, was at a barbershop, where the barber used a straight razor. The Proglide was effortless and gave me a very close shave. My 5 O&#x27;Clock shadow was late by a full hour! I highly recommend the Proglide if you care about a smooth, close and proper shave.</li>
    <li> I was recently given the opportunity to test the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to give it a fair trial, I shaved half of my face and head with the Gillette razor and the other half with a comparable 5 blade razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first noticed that it is considerably heavier than my other razor. This is due to the internal motor and battery. Even without the motor, I prefer the more substantial feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to the quality of the shave, I did get an extremely close shave in which I did not have to keep shaving specific areas repeatedly. In fact, I got as close a shave from the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power as I did with my personal razor. It took about the same amount of time, gave the same closeness, and my skin felt just as smooth. I did not notice a improvement with either the pivoting head, nor the vibration although it did feel soothing in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really have no negatives to list but unless you are looking to replace your current razor, I see no reason to search this one out.</li>
    <li> I love this razor. The shave is so close its almost weird! The blades each last me months. Don&#x27;t buy anything else. It is worth the money for something that you use so often. It is actually fun to shave with this razor because there is no drag.</li>
    <li> My husband sometimes uses cheap products and when he saw this he was like I already have an electric razor but after his first shave he was very impressed. I will definitely be buying this razor for him.</li>
    <li> BzzAgent and #GotItFree. I was skeptical about the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power. I thought it was going to be just another razor. I got it in the mail and tried it the next day. I absolutely love the close shave it gave me. Its a good 5 bladed razor that doesn&#x27;t nick and cut you up. I have yet to try the power part of it as I was wanting to try and see how close of a shave I could get without it first. I am going to try the power part tomorrow. If it gives a good shave without the power , what an excellent shave it will give with it. So glad I got this. I can honestly say that I found my razor.</li>
    <li> This is a nice razor. No, it&#x27;s not the fanciest, but it&#x27;s also not a disposable. It shaves a lot better than a disposable! I&#x27;m not quite sure what the battery operated &amp;#34;vibration&amp;#34; is supposed to do, bc I don&#x27;t notice a difference with or without it on. The flex ball is great though! It moves around my face and jaw almost as well as my Phillips Norellco electric shaver!</li>
    <li> I have somewhat sensitive skin and have never really been fully satisfied with a razor. I received my Gilette Fusion Proglide Flexball razor last week and have used it three times without any irritation! I think I have found what works for my face and I recommend it to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I received the product from Gillette to review.  From the beginning I thought this razor was strange but as someone shaved me (I am disabled)  this was a great shave. No pulling, the accidental cut. Absolutely none of that a hassle free close great shave.</li>
    <li> I shaved with this razor 4 times, twice with the vibrator on and twice with it off. first of all I still don&#x27;t know why it vibrates and it sure didn&#x27;t do any thing for the shaving. I didn&#x27;t really care for the 5 blades. it didn&#x27;t do anything my regular razor does and as with multiple blades it was harder to clean. as I checked out the price for this razor and the price of the replacement blades I personally would not buy or use it. just my opinion.</li>
    <li> Love it!  No more little knicks.</li>
    <li> Just got the Fusion Proglide razor and gave it a try today. First, let me just say that Gillette has done a great job on packaging this razor. In the past, it was a pain to open the package without using a hammer and chisel. Much easier to open. The top is perforated so it sort of tears open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically use the Proglide 3 in 1 razor because I really think Gillette razor blades are the best when it comes to clean shaves. Their blades can be a bit pricey, but definitely top notch. It comes with a battery and buzzes I guess is the best way to explain it. I really didn&#x27;t notice that much of a difference when I turned it off. The flexball is kind of cool. Probably is best if you shave your body vs just the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a really good razor. Good blades, comfortable in hand, great shave. Strongly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor! I have very sensitive skin and normally get razor burn very easily on my neck, but that wasn&#x27;t the case with this razor. Powered by AAA battery the Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch left my face and neck feeling extra soft when no sign of razor burn anywhere. I would definitely recomend this product!</li>
    <li> I received this razor from Gillette and it is amazing. It felt like I was cutting through butter with a hot knife! I was previously using the Gillette Mach 3 and didn&#x27;t think it could get any better but this thing gives an even closer shave with very little resistance! The flex ball makes it very easy to shave my jaw line and leaves no nicks or cuts!</li>
    <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide razor with flexball really did give me a nice clean shave. I like the look and feel of it. My only problem is I think this razor would be more for someone who shaves does a clean shaving everytime. I always leave a thing beard and it wanted to curve in places I wanted it to stay straight. But other than that I really liked the results after using.</li>
    <li> Great product, great price!</li>
    <li> Love it. Hugs the face better then ever.</li>
    <li> My Name is Mike and I am using my fiances account to write my review. I got this product from Gillette and I absolutely LOVE it. It contours to my face and gets every last hair without any hassle. My face stays smooth for days!!! This product is on the top of my list of something I would buy for friends and family.  I highly recommend it!!!!</li>
    <li> I was going to go old school and get a single blade safety razor but received the pro glide power razor. It is without a doubt the best most comfortable razor that I have used. It is smooth, gentle on the face and one of the closest shaves I&#x27;ve had next to the barber shop. Well done Gillette. The issue regarding the $1 claim is a moot one for me. I shave once to twice a day. The Mach 3 would only last 4 days for me. The pro glides are lasting 14 days with the same closeness. A must try.</li>
    <li> Probably my closest shave ever! Makes my face so smooth and feels like a spa experience with the vibration. My wife even used it on her legs and she loved it. Would definitely recommend!!! I received the product from Gillette.</li>
    <li> I thought the battery operation would just be a gimmick, not worth much, but it does seem to work and make the shave very smooth.  I guess my face is &amp;#34;flat&amp;#34; enough that I don&#x27;t really feel the swivel motion of the shave, but it is a very comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent razor which easy and safe to use,I am still on my first blade after two months and no cuts.this razor is a pleasure to use ,the length of use of the blade makes it cheaper to buy than other makes over a period of time&lt;br /&gt;P.madden</li>
    <li> Fantastic! Best shave ever - definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> This really deserves it&#x27;s 5-Star because of its new flex ball technology. I don&#x27;t have to stretch my face and move around, I love this razor I would really recommend this to any one.</li>
    <li> overall I found this to be a good shaver but I wasn&#x27;t as impressed by the razor as the commercials may have one believe. Sure, the ball technology is pretty cool but you still need to stretch your skin are lift her head oddly to get every spot. I read somewhere that this razor shaves just a few microns closer than a traditional one - an improvement sure but probably not worth it if the price is much higher than a competing model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I have learned and strongly recommend is drying off the razor blades after every use. If you do this they barely dull, I&#x27;ve been able to use a single razor head for several months with it still performing like it was new! Try it out, it&#x27;s a big money saver.</li>
    <li> I recived the Gillette Fusion ProGlide SilverTouch Power Razor from Gillette as a promotion to try. I love this product. I use it twice a week and could not be more pleased. FlexBall Handle Technology responds to contours for Gillette&#x27;s best shave, is an understatement. Its amazing in all aspects of  a truly world class shave. No need to go over areas more than once. I highly recommend this Gillete Fusion Proglide Silvertouch to every man out there! You will never go back to your old razors again!</li>
    <li> This was a really great razor.  I have course facial hair. I  have always had problems with razor burn from trying to shave close, especially under my neck. I typically have to go &amp;#34;against the grain&amp;#34; to get a close enough shave. This razor works without irritation or cutting my skin no matter what direction I go. That was pretty impressive.  Then I noticed that I can shave &amp;#34;with the grain&amp;#34; for even less chance of irritation, and the razor mows my beard off after three days growth right down to the skin.  Great Job, Gillette.</li>
    <li> I HATE shaving! That being said I have to for work. I usually have to go back and touch up around the chin and jaw line areas. I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch Power Men&#x27;s Razor With Flexball Handle Technology from Gillette as a promotion to try out. With the Flexball handle I have noticed that I now only have to go over the areas once to get the same result. I was skeptical about the new \\&quot;gimic\\&quot; but after trying it, I have to say I think it gives me a closer shave in less time. I would recommend it to everyone!</li>
    <li> Cheap, noisy, low rpm motor, handle very large and heavy - feels like I got a small shaving hummer, ball does almost nothing, excellent blades</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Shick quatro for several years but after trying this Gillette Fusion Proglide it will be my razor from now on. The best shave I&#x27;ve ever had! I normally shave every other day but this razor shaves so close I can now get by with once every third day. My face is still smooth the second day and my beard is just starting to show again on the third. The flexball handle keeps the blades perfectly against your skin getting every hair the first time. I highly recommend this razor. Virtually zero irritation for a truly comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> I like the razor a lot. It seems to provide a nice smooth shave and with the vibration action it helps keep the shave closer than conventional razors.</li>
    <li> I got sucked in buying the razor due to the continuously advertisement by Gillette during WorldCup FIFA.&lt;br /&gt;I am glad I bought it. It is a huge improvement over the non powered Mach 3 blades&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)  The pivoting flexball gives me an even closer shave as it follows the contours of my face even more closely especially the chin and upper lip area&lt;br /&gt;2) The razor is smooth and doesn&#x27;t hurt you.&lt;br /&gt;3) The blades are much better than the Mach 3&lt;br /&gt;4) You just have shave only nce.  My older razor, I had to shave 3-4 times to get rid of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think you can go back to the older version once you use this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> This Gillette razor I have to say is the best razor I&#x27;ve used in years. My face doesn&#x27;t get cut up and it stays smoother longer. I really like the vibration too. I would definitely recommend getting this razor totally worth it.</li>
    <li> Ok..So we upgrade our phones every two years...our TV&#x27;s every 5 or so years....why did it take so long to get a high tech upgraded razor??  Gillette got it right on this one!! I&#x27;ve been a Proglide user for the past 5 years, and this new Flexball answers all the complaints over the past years.  A mans face isn&#x27;t flat!  The Flexball rolls effortlessly over every facial contour....which means a lot less nicks and cuts!  Thanks for the upgrade!! Received this razor straight from Gillette as a beta tester and have put it through lots of shaves across the country!  Well done!</li>
    <li> This is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used. I used the head on my old fusion handle, shaved half my face, then switched the head over to the new handle and shaved the other half. If just floated over my face. My wife knew immediately which was smoother, which was the flex ball side. This is the end of shaving evolution. No more redesigns needed. This is the end of new razor purchased. THIS IS THE LAST RAZOR YOU&#x27;LL EVER HAVE TO BUY. PERIOD.</li>
    <li> I am so in love with the Gillette Fusion Razor. It does the trick and gives me a close shave without nicking my face. I have given these razors as gifts to my co-workers and friends. It is sleek in design and really works better than any razor on the market and I have tried them all.</li>
    <li> Gillette gave me this razor so I could try it and give my honest opinion. Well here to is; I love, love, LOVE it!! I mean really, whats not to love? It gives me a very smooth shave but still cuts closer than any razor I&#x27;ve ever used. And I have course hair! And don&#x27;t get me started on the vibrate. It feels like you aren&#x27;t even shaving. The flexball lets the blade get every part of my jaw for a cleaner cut with no Knicks. My wife even uses it for her legs! My only complaint is that the price for Gillette blades are a bit high. But, you do get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> It must be difficult for the folks at Gillette to keep coming up with new ways to improve their razor. The Flexball sounds like a great idea, but in practice, adds very little to the shave experience. Just didn&#x27;t see the flexball doing much at all. If anything, I prefer the shave of the standard fusion power which does the job pretty darn well. Still can&#x27;t blame Gillette for trying - I expect next year they will be trying to convince us that 6 blades are better than 5.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this razor to try it out and see if i would actually want to switch over razors from my usually standard Shick, and i am glad i did! I loved this razor like it was my baby. I just got to experience the close shave that it delivers last night, and after 24 hours i have yet to see any of me usually standard 5 o&#x27;clock shadow. The rotating ball head was also great and delivered a the much needed extra contact when shaving my head (other razors are a task due to the little bit of surface area that they cover over the fact that they do not have any rotation in the head). I can without a doubt say that i will be buying myself more of these in the near future. The price may be high, but you get every penny worth of value out of it no questions asked!</li>
    <li> The new Fusion Proglide Silvertouch razor with Flexball handle has converted me to a razor user again. I have sensitive skin and have been using electric razors for the past few years. But after just a couple shaves with this razor, I am hooked. The Flexball handle really helps the razor glide smoothly on my face for a comfortable and close shave every time. This is a great razor! And my wife loves the clean shave I get from this razor as well!</li>
    <li> Full Disclosure:  I received this razor free of charge from Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;I have always used Gillette products and the razor&#x27;s quality deserves the Gillette name.  This razor gives a great, smooth shave.  I have large hands and the handle seemed small so I was unsure I would have enough control.  After a couple of uses, I became comfortable using it.  The only downside is the cost of the refills.  The price of refills for all razors has really gone up over the years.  While the product is great, its upkeep may become pricey and in turn the loss of 1 star.</li>
    <li> It can cut your face if you are not careful.</li>
    <li> I was sent this this razor free to try from Gillette. It works awesome. I really the flexball technology, it helps the razor contour to my face quite well, and it works better than similar razors of it&#x27;s kind that I have tried. It gave me a very close, smooth shave. I liked this product more than the Braun electric razor I normally use daily and I definitely plan on purchasing refills so I can continue to use this great product.</li>
    <li> Every time I upgrade my razor I go through he same thought-process: it starts with me wondering how they could possibly improve on the previous model and ends with me amazed that they did it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THis new razor was no different.  Outside of the price I have zero complaints about the my old Gillette Fusion Proglide handle and razor blades, and I was certainly never cursing the lack of a ball-joint or flexible handle.  Even more, even though they&#x27;ve been offering &amp;#34;power&amp;#34; versions for a while I&#x27;ve never tried it because it seems like nothing but a gimmick (what would &amp;#34;power&amp;#34; even do - it&#x27;s a straight razor blade slicing hairs at their base?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I was happy to give this one a try and BOOM - I won&#x27;t be going back any time soon.  The blade cartridges are the same as all the fusion razors, which is good.  The improvement is that the blade does rotate slightly and it follows the curves of your skin better.  Also, the power feature DOES do something - or at least it FEELS like it&#x27;s doing something - I don&#x27;t know what, but when I fired it up I instantly sensed I was getting a better shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is longer than the the non-power version, but the battery gives it more heft and it feels more significant in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is that this thing gives the best shave and is the cutting edge of shaving tech.  The blades are still ridiculously expensive, and you can live with older Fusion models, but maybe life&#x27;s too short to mess around with lousy shaves.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been meaning to do a review on all the different razor cartridges. I shave my head and face at least 3 times a week and have been for over 20 years. The Proglide cartridges are my favorites, but I usually buy Schick Hydro 5 since I get longer use out of them and they are cheaper than the Proglides. I saw this flexball handle with working display at a local store and picked one up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a head shaver, this is the best handle for you. As simple as the technology looks, it really makes a huge difference on your head, especially in the crown area. I&#x27;ve been shaving long enough and frequent enough that I rarely get a nick on my head, but if I do, it&#x27;s in the middle of the crown right where the back and top of my head meets. This handle allows a smooth transition over that area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the face, the main advantage I see with this handle is in the lower cheekbone/jaw area. It really does a nice job of gliding along that area which is often an area where I miss hairs at. I did find this handle along with 4 Proglide cartridges at the big membership club warehouse for under twenty dollars and had a three dollar coupon on it, made it roughly fifteen dollars for the handle and 4 cartridges. I really wish they could figure out a way to make these cartridges a bit cheaper and/or longer lasting. If I could get two weeks of use out of one, I would switch over to these all the time. And for what it&#x27;s worth, I prefer the silvertouch version, just feels better in the hand.</li>
    <li> What can I tell you?  It&#x27;s a razor... nothing special.  I used it on my legs and underarms and did not feel or notice a difference.  This might be because the item is marketed towards men and the contours of their faces.  As far as a female&#x27;s anatomy is concerned, it is just another gimmicky razor.  The vibrating is annoying and placed in a horrible location which causes me to turn it on and off.  The roller ball head swivels and does make it easier to navigate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO not recommend for women&#x27;s use.  Our products better suit us as this product ed is most likely better suited to my husband&#x27;s face :)</li>
    <li> So I was a bit skeptical about this razor because it has a button that makes it vibrate... which is seriously kind of weird. But I tried it because I&#x27;ve been told time and time again that men&#x27;s razors are better than women&#x27;s. In the end, I&#x27;m not really sure if the vibrating element really made a difference. I&#x27;d say go for a regular razor and skip this one&#x27;s extra cost.</li>
    <li> very impressed with the flexball handle, a great improvement , much more ergonomic to use .</li>
    <li> Gillette sent me a free razor to review their product. I found this to be the best razor I have ever used. The pivoting head really tracks the curves and contours of your face. I have sensitive skin so I use this with Gillette sensitive shave gel. The handle fits my hand perfectly and feels natural. The battery operation makes it even smoother than the regular razor. I bought the Fusion before the battery operated one came out, and it didn&#x27;t give me as close a shave as this one. I will continue to use this razor from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used Gillette for years as their products seem to give me the closest shave. When their new products come out, I tend to upgrade to them. The new Fusion Proglide Power is the best razor yet. It has a pivoting head that moves with the contours of your face to give it a close shave. I get a close good shave every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette made this FUSION fit a guy&#x27;s hand. It is light weight but has a sure, firm grip. The unit is well crafted and gives you a clean shave quickly with no bumps, bites or nicks. The vibrating motion helps to ensure that you get the closest, cleanest and smoothest shave you can imagine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative would be the replacement blades are expensive but I find they&#x27;re worth it. You can buy the blades in multiple units and lower the cost per razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette NAILED it. I&#x27;m glad I tried this out and give it a buy recommendation.</li>
    <li> I love this razor!!!!  My face is so smooth and no more cuts!</li>
    <li> I received this as a trial test from Gillette and think its great. I have tried most of the Gillette razors and I prefer this one the most. Very cool desighn and works great. Smooth close shaves everytime!</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide with Flexball from Gillette earlier this week.  I could not wait to get it in the mail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using an electric razor for the past 5 years and have only used a real razor once a month or less when I would let my beard grow out some and it be too hard to shave with the electric one.  I did not shave for a few days and when I received this razor in the mail I tried it out right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Opening the box, you could tell it was built well.  It felt sturdy and the handle holding the battery was tight and well sealed.  I knew it came with the battery in it, but was a little confused at first look because there were no instructions explaining how to use the power from the battery or how to replace it, but after looking at it for a second you can easily see the power button and that just twisting the handle opens up the battery container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always had trouble shaving with small moles by my ear and on my chin, but the Flexball technology on this razor along with the power function helped it glide easily over all the contours on my face, chin, and neck.  The vibration felt real nice while shaving and made it a real easy smooth and close shave.  For the first time in a long time using a real razor, I did not experience any cuts on my neck or chin from shaving and I believe it was the combination of the Flexball and the vibration that made this possible.  My face felt so smooth after my first use.  I have finally found a razor that has made me think about leaving behind my electric razor and using this one full time.  My girlfriend also likes it a lot more than my electric razor because of how smooth and close the shave is compared to an electric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this razor to anyone interested in trying something new.  You will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I received this little guy as a gift (NOTE: I received the razor as a gift directly from Gillette!).  I&#x27;m not usually a big fan of non electric razors or shaving consistently in general.  I have a ton going on and I don&#x27;t like spending the time required for a regular razor and shaving cream.  But, I got this one and I felt obligated to at least try it.&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve found:&lt;br /&gt;1. This thing bends and moves to follow the contour of your face like nothing I&#x27;ve ever used. - The whole process goes faster and easier!  You don&#x27;t have to contort you face or hands to get the hard to reach spots.&lt;br /&gt;2. It moves really quickly and easily across your skin w/o missing anything.  - Given the volume of facial hair I had accumulated I did have to make extra effort to keep the blades unplugged the first time I used it.&lt;br /&gt;3. You get a really close shave. - I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the vibration or the blades or what but it leaves your face - smooth - very smooth!  As an added bonus, the vibration feels cool.&lt;br /&gt;4. Batteries included! - Well it&#x27;s only the 1 AAA but still it&#x27;s cool that they included a decent battery.&lt;br /&gt;So in summary:&lt;br /&gt;Did this convert me to shaving daily? No&lt;br /&gt;Is it quicker and easier than any other razor I&#x27;ve had: Yes&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be using this bad boy every date night.  It&#x27;s actually a requirement as per. my girlfriend!  She like how smooth it leaves me and I love how fast I can get it like that.  Overall i&#x27;d suggest this razor to anyone who needs to shave.</li>
    <li> Gillette Fusion ProGlide! I really did love it! For years I have been using disposable razors did not realize how much better shave I could have been getting. The track ball is the amazing for keeping contact with face at every angle. The blade design also makes for much closer shave. Now for the power razor part, who would have dreamed! Without a doubt this is now my new favorite shaving system.  And I must admit I do not know which part is the best. Must be just the right combination of blades, track ball, and the added power for the best shave ever. I have sensitive skin and usually end up with an irritated face after shaving so I always shave at night to allow my face to calm down before going out in public. This last Saturday night I forgot to shave so had to shave Sunday Morning before heading out to church. Wow no irritation best shave I believe I have ever had. Went to a professional barber and got straight razor shave several weeks ago, will never do that again. The Gillette Fusion ProGlide is a better plan!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many razors in the past, but this one seems to be a keeper. I have pretty sensitive In and tend to get pretty bad razor burn. This razor eliminated that. It gave me a nice smooth shave and no unsightly bumps. The pivoting head gets even the toughest to get spots. Definitely a must have.</li>
    <li> I received a Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch Power Men&#x27;s Razor With Flexball Handle from Gillette as a product sample to be reviewed.  I had tried power razors in the past but had never tried a razor with anything like a &amp;#34;flexball handle&amp;#34;.  I was genuinely impressed by both!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blades.&lt;br /&gt;It seems that as I age, my face becomes harder to shave. Changes in skin texture and skin sensitivity become more of an issue with each passing year.  The Fusion Proglide razors were very close shaving and gentle on my face. That&#x27;s a rare combination that I had pretty much given up on with the brand I was using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flexball Handle.&lt;br /&gt;I was reminded of that vacuum cleaner commercial with &amp;#34;the ball&amp;#34; handle when I first looked at this shaver.  It really can maneuver and keep the blade flush against my face from almost any angle.  It eliminated the problem I have had in the past of skipping over certain areas of my face that are hard to reach.  One swipe was all that was required on my entire face. I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Power Razor Handle.&lt;br /&gt;In the past I couldn&#x27;t really tell the difference between power razors and non-power.  I tested this one by shaving with power on vs. power off on either side of my face.  There was definitely a difference between ease of use on each side and quality or closeness of shave on each side. I am sold on the effectiveness of the power handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product.  If there were an area that the Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch Power Men&#x27;s Razor With Flexball Handle doesn&#x27;t measure up, I didn&#x27;t find it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Gillette!!</li>
    <li> Almost the perfect shave. Like it a lot.</li>
    <li> Had the version without the flexball...this is a lot better.</li>
    <li> Great shaver; love the handle and blades.  The power option gives a Super shave.</li>
    <li> Repeat purchase, one of the best shaving units. Built sleek and in style. Its a repeat buy for us</li>
    <li> I tried this instead of my trusty old Mach 3. I received this from Gillette to try out. Here&#x27;s what I found:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being a beardy dude, I wanted to make sure it was something that could trim around my cheeks and under my chin to make things tight. I found the vibrating part distracting, and the blades to do no better job than the Mach3, but they a definitely sharper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering the gap of about $10 in blades from this razor to the Mach 3 blades, I&#x27;d probably not continue using this razor.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying I have been using an electric razor for MANY years now. I have only used an actual razor a few times a year max when I was away and forgot my razor. Prior to my electric razor use I was strictly a Gillette user that had 3 blades.&lt;br /&gt;I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor with Flexball Handle Technology (now that&#x27;s a mouthful) from Gillette as a trial so I figured I would give it a try. I was skeptical that I would like it to say the least. To the point that I didn&#x27;t like it before I even tried it. Well, I finally said what the hell, I will give it a try I can always finish with the electric razor when I confirmed I didn&#x27;t like the blades. I WAS WRONG! I cannot stress this enough.&lt;br /&gt;From the very first pass (which I was cringing before I even did it expecting it to pull my hair and/or niche me) my outlook changed. It was smooth and easy as it glided along my face great. The Flexball swivel made all the curves of my face and neck seem like childs play. This razor kept such close contact with my skin.&lt;br /&gt;The vibrating handle.... well that part I can take or leave. I used it both ways and honestly didn&#x27;t realize too much of a difference. I may after using it a few more times figuring Gillette must have had a good reason to add it.&lt;br /&gt;Now the conflicted part. I have just recently purchased the expensive electric razor. Granted they both works great, but the new Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor with Flexball Handle Technology razor gives me a closer shave than expected. I can get away with waiting an extra 2 days between shaves. For now I will probably use a combo of the 2.&lt;br /&gt;Great job with this one Gillette!</li>
    <li> I have to say this is the smoothest shave that I have gotten from a razor.  I even had someone ask me if I had a professional shave!  I am so glad the Gillette sent me a sample to try it out because I am going to for sure keep using it!</li>
    <li> In a market that is over-saturated with all sorts of razors that promise to do this or that, Gilette continues to prove that it is worthy of being heralded as the best of class.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gilette Fusion ProGlide SilverTouch Power razor is another testament to Gilette&#x27;s skill, expertise, and even artistry, when it comes to razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Fusion ProGlide SilverTouch Power razor provides me with the quickest shave of all the razors I&#x27;ve used, electric and manual. What&#x27;s even better is it gave me that quick, close shave with little to no irritation. I hope it continues to perform that way even as the blades get more dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adding to the list of features such as five blades and vibration, the FlexBall handle pivots as needed to wrap around the curves of my face (i.e., my chin) with ease and complete comfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The precision blade is not something I use often, just every once and a while after a nice haircut to keep my sideburns straight and tidy, but it&#x27;s a standard feature that no razor should stray away from if it is to even be considered as a top tier razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one and only complaint (besides the outrageous price on razor cartridges) is that the grip of the handle doesn&#x27;t reduce slippage as much as I would&#x27;ve hoped it would when wet. It does fine for the most part, though. It&#x27;s certainly not something major enough to not warrant using this product that Gilette generously let me try for free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would gladly recommend the Gilette Fusion ProGlide SilverTouch Power razor to any man who appreciates a fast, precise, and smooth shave.</li>
    <li> I received a complimentary Gillette Pro Glide Silvertouch Power Razor from Gillette to try out and I love it!  I was already using the Gillette Power Fusion Razor and honestly I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be much different, but the head swivels which allows it to smoothly glide across your skin without really applying any pressure at all. I&#x27;ve been using it everyday for a month and it&#x27;s still sharp and the battery seems to be as powerful as the first shave. It&#x27;s definitely a keeper.</li>
    <li> After years of using cheap disposable razors I got sent this gem .  I didn&#x27;t really expect much because I believed that all razors basically did the same thing and that this razor only looked better. After using it I found that not only was it a more comfortable shave, but it gave me a very close shave. I always use the blade on the back to edge my beard and it&#x27;s actually very convenient to have. I would also cut myself a lot with disposable razors but I&#x27;ve never experienced that with this razor. Shaving with this razor is also a lot faster than shaving with disposable razors. It seems to shave hair easier and you don&#x27;t have to use multiple strokes just to make sure you got all of it. I&#x27;m very satisfied with the way this razor works. Other than that I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> I received this razor for free to try out and put my thoughts out there on it. Gillette is a good brand. I use manual and electric. The Fusion Proglide works so much better than a disposable. It really does glide on all over easily. The handle is comfy and controllable (same as most other razors).I personally don&#x27;t need the power (vibration) of this razor I felt it did nothing extra special for me. Over all though, I did get a clean close shave. Didn&#x27;t have to spend a long time either. Definetely a good razor.</li>
    <li> I received this razor free from Gillette. Upon initial inspection of it, I doubted that it would be any different than any other razor. I decided to shave one side of my face with it and the other side of my face with my existing razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I get to that I want to mention a few things I really liked about this razor. I really liked how the flex ball allows the razor to move especially when moving around my jaw line when I&#x27;m shaving. It allowed me to move down below my jawline in one shaving motion rather than having to remove it and reposition it to keep going. It shaves down to skin so it leaves my skin feeling very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, when I tested it the first time I used it, I shaved the left side of my face with the proglide power flexball razor. I used my existing razor on my right side. The left side with this razor did come out smoother and a much closer shave. The &amp;#34;power&amp;#34; of this razor provides the vibration that I assume helps with a closer shave. It also didn&#x27;t take me as long to shave. I save about 2-3 minutes. My right side took as long as it usually does and it wasn&#x27;t as smooth on the first go. It took several strokes to get it to feel like it was as smooth as the left side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like the most out of this razor was the way it felt the next day. The left side (proglide power flexball razor) was smoother than the right side (my existing razor). So it&#x27;s obvious to me that this razor provided a closer shave and in less time.  The flexball technology really does make it easier to shave with less strokes and in my case, seemed to save me some time. It definitely cut closer to the skin allowing for a smoother shave. I really love this razor and plan on sticking with it.</li>
    <li> I really like the Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch Power Men&#x27;s Razor with Flexball Handle. I like all things about it except the name of it. Anyway, I have used this razor every since I learned about it. I got a sample of this from Gillette, and I must say there is no other razor like it. I guarantee if you used this razor just once, you would NEVER use another one. Do yourself a favor and get this one. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This razor works great even for someone with sensitive skin. Very close shave without irritation. A very good razor would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Since Gillette was gracious enough to provide me with their Fusion ProGlide Power with FlexBall Handle free of charge, I thought I should provide more than just an initial assessment of the product. Also, in my experience, the first time I use a new razor I get an amazing shave. But how will this razor stack up after I have used it for a week and have grown accustomed to the pivoting head action the FlexBall handle provides? Read on to see how it fared for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face: I have fairly sensitive skin. I usually try to only shave a few days a week unless I have a big meeting to avoid razor burn. I find that shaving every other day provides a closer shave. My biggest problem area is my neck. Most days I have terrible razor burn all over my throat, many times with nicks. I also have a very thick beard, so razors seem to dull quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My setup. I shave in the shower. I like to let the steam from the shower get my face prepped to shave. I also wash my hair and face prior to shaving. I use a shaving lubricant that resembles a diluted lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 1: Woke up early to get to work after a holiday weekend. Haven’t shaved in 4 days. This is some heavy stubble. Also, shaving early before my face “wakes up” can sometimes lead to disaster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave. Razor glided through the stubble like cutting warm butter. The vibration from the handle is interesting (I have used a Gillette power razor in the past, but it’s been awhile). I think the vibration helps me not press down so much. This is important because pushing down yields bad results. So the the shave is great on my cheeks, mustache, and chin. What about the neck (my problem area). It’s been a few hours since the shave and my neck is still smooth. Razor burn is minimal, and I think I can definitely shave again tomorrow. So far so good! This razor works well. My only complaint so far is that the power started cutting on and off during the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 2: Super close shave!That is rare for shaving back-to-back. Unfortunately, I do have some razor burn and nicks. This is just the way my skin is sometimes. It still glided pretty effortlessly along the contours of my face. Not sure I see the benefit of the FlexBall. I am interested to see how the razor handles my shave tomorrow now that I do have some razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 3: Not good. Lots of razor burn. I’m going to take tomorrow off and shave on the weekend to see if that helps. Don’t get me wrong. I don’t totally blame the razor. This happens with most razors I use from time to time, but I have lots of razor burn the shave isn’t as close as the previous days. Also, the power vibration is still turning itself on and off. I wonder if it is a faulty handle or if the battery is low. The battery came packaged with the razor, so I hope it isn’t low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 4: Rest. No shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 5: The razor has been used 3 times now. As previously stated, I have a very thick beard. This added up to a pretty painful shave. It’s fairly normal. I ended with not that close a shave on my face, but surprisingly, even though there was razor burn, my neck was pretty smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:I was hoping that the razor would last a week, or that the FlexBall would be a revelation. Unfortunately, it didn’t make a difference to me. Overall, I think this razor is on par with other Fusion razors I’ve used in the past. What would get me to shell out the money for a Gillette razor in the future isn’t more blades or a fancy handle that pivots in every direction (although the up and down pivot that has been standard for years is great), but a way to keep the razor sharper for longer. I’m not one of those men that goes weeks (or months) without changing blades either. I change my blade weekly, so what I’m asking for is a razor that lasts a week, 5 shaves. Give me that and you can keep FlexBall.</li>
    <li> Have been using the Gillette</li>
    <li> I received the product for free from Gillette in exchange for a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor bridges the gap between an electric shaver and a manual one.  If you&#x27;re on the fence about switching to an electric, this is a good product to try.  It&#x27;s also a great option if you&#x27;re traveling and may not be able to charge your razor as it&#x27;s battery powered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flexi ball does a great job of helping to navigate the curves and difficult spots.  It provides a nice clean shave.  I still prefer my electric, but this is a nice option if the electric isn&#x27;t an option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife has since claimed it, and she has found it to be better than any woman&#x27;s razor she&#x27;s tried.  She says it doesn&#x27;t tug on the hairs like a lot of other razors, navigates curves very well, and cleans up easily, even with a thick shaving cream or gel.  She also finds minimal irritation.</li>
    <li> To be honest I thought this was going to be a big gimmick like other &amp;#34;ball&amp;#34; things. This really does work very well. I have a chiseled type face with high cheek bones and its nice to have a razor that does move to the contours of my face. I would recommend this to everyone or anybody that is looking for a very good manual razor.</li>
    <li> When u have to shave before going into work everyday you need the best razor you can find. The new Gillette Fusion Proglide is great. It is very smooth and fits in your hand comfortably. I would recommend this product for everyone who shaves.</li>
    <li> I love this razor.  I&#x27;ve been using the cheap disposable razors for quite a while now and started getting really tired of cutting my face and not getting a close enough shave.  This razor glides over every contour of my face, and I haven&#x27;t once pulled my hair or cut myself with it.  It is so smooth and easy to use.  Makes shaving a lot quicker and keeps my face smooth and hair free longer.  Would highly recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I received this free from Gillette and I am so happy with it. The flex really makes a difference. No stubbles were left on my face. Usually my neck has stubbles from other razors including my electric razors. With this razor my neck was smooth. I have been using the same blade for two weeks and I shave every other day. I am still getting smooth results. The only thing and it is really not a big problem but I would like a slightly shorter handle but that&#x27;s just me.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor. It gives me the smoothest shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten in a long time and the blades seem to last forever. Its comfortable to hold and durable.</li>
    <li> I have to shave every day because of work, so finding a good razor is important to me. I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch with Flexball from Gillette to try it out and it truly is a great razor! It gives me a nice, clean shave without irritating my face. It glides easily and gives me a close shave. I&#x27;ve tried many different razors, but I like this one!</li>
    <li> The Gillette Proglide has improved my skin texture. Less shave bumps and skin is softer. The only problem is my wife tries to steal it for her legs.</li>
    <li> One of the better shaves I&#x27;ve had in a long time!</li>
    <li> Thus is one of the best razors I have ever used.  No pulling,  no razor burn,  and one of the closet shaves I have ever firm.</li>
    <li> The Fusion ProGlide Power with NEW FlexBall Handle Technology is a nice razor.  I&#x27;ve used the Gillette brand in the past with success and this razor doesn&#x27;t disappoint.  It&#x27;s a nice weight and makes for a tight, comfortable shave.  While not unique to this particular razor, the blade on the back for trimming is a handy feature.  I received this razor from Gillette to try.  There&#x27;s really nothing NOT to like about it. Give it a try...you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Razor works far better than expected. Tried non power model and was not impressed. Bought this model and Gillette Proglide sensitive skin shaving gel and got the best home shave in forty years. The power model really does a better job. Shave matched a real barber shop shave for closeness ( so says my wife ). I do not think you can get a better shave without a straight razor.</li>
    <li> 3 blades, then 4 blades, then 5 blades, then &amp;#34;power&amp;#34;...I thought this would just be another gimmick.  I mean how much different can another razor be, right?  Well I was wrong.  This gives me the closest and smoothest shave I have even had.  I was completely surprised.  Now got one as a give for my dad as well.  Only been using about a month and it is great.  The only thing I wonder though is it feels like these blades don&#x27;t keep their sharpness as much as my old blades -- may be that they are sharper than my old ones but I used to get a month out of blades, now getting closer to 3 weeks.  This razor is great either way.</li>
    <li> Not much of an improvement and not even close to the Schick Hydro 5 which by far the best razor on the market.The Gillette gives about 1-2 good shaves when new but the Schick holds up to 12-15 shaves.</li>
    <li> Best razor I&#x27;ve ever tried. Smoothest shave plus plus plus no cuts!</li>
    <li> Before trying the Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch, I had been using a safety razor for over a year. I did a side by side test comparing the closeness of shave and ease of use between my safety razor and the Proglide; the Proglide outperformed my safety razor in both categories.  In fact, I went back and used the Proglide to finish the side of my face I had initially shaved with the safety razor.  The Proglide was easier and quicker to use, and resulted in a much closer and smoother shave. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am not usually a fan of using \\&quot;manual\\&quot; razors and much prefer to use powered electric models instead. However, I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch Power Men&#x27;s Razor with Flexball Technology for free from the company and decided to give it it&#x27;s fair try.    My previous experience with manual razors left me cut, often bloodied, and usually with horrible razor burn. Due to their inability to really twist and curve around, small cuts on my neck and jawline were common. This Gillette model tipped left to right and better flexing and pivoting than any other razor I&#x27;ve tried - especially the electric ones that I most prefer using. This made it much easier for me to get around my jaw and afforded me a much closer shave with no pulling of my skin. Score one for the Proglide!    The \\&quot;Flexball Technology\\&quot; truly does sound like a gimmick. I&#x27;m still skeptical if it is REALLY worth the extra weight in the razor handle as well as the added cost of the product. I did notice that there was some vibration while using the product, which I&#x27;m not sure did much for my shave, but was nice to have as a feature regardless of it&#x27;s efficacy.    Finally, it was nice to see that instead of coming out with disposable razor heads that only worked with this model of razor, Gillette decided to make all of their heads uniform. Should I be upgrading from the Gillette Fusion Proglide to this version with the Flexball, I could take all of the razor heads that I bought with my old razor handle and they would work with this version seamlessly. It&#x27;s great to see a company be mindful of the consumer.</li>
    <li> I really like this razor a lot! The swivel head cuts down on my shaving time from having to go over the area again and again. I am an awkward shaver and the razor following the shape of my face is really nice! Being able to replace the blades is also very nice. I usually don&#x27;t like electric razors like this because for my sensitive skin they shake to much. This razor was very smooth on the skin and din&#x27;t leave me any razor burn. Of the low end razors this is the best I have found.</li>
    <li> Item: Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch Power Razor&lt;br /&gt;This is a really good razor that provides additional protection with the added vibration feature. Less irritation from the power, and the flexing head does mold to the contours of the face. The blades are very close together (same as manual Fusion razor), there&#x27;s a lot more and thicker grip, the razor is heavier than other razors but still lightweight. The head flexes back and forward (Y-axis), and because of the flexball, it rotates left and right (X-axis).  I shave in the direction of hair growth, and noticed that the movement of the flexball was rarely used in my case. I guess it depends on how you shave. The blades themselves do not flex in and out, but the razor still does a great job of giving a great shave, especially with the Power on. The whole razor works very smoothly in its movement. The cap for the battery locks tightly in place and is watertight, but don&#x27;t drop it in water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My facial hair is dense and coarse. I use an electric razor to handle most of my facial hair, and the remaining is removed with a manual razor. For people with a light facial hair, this thing will handle your hair easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flexball feature: The flexball allows movement left and right (X-axis). It moves very smoothly.  The way I shave did not utilize the flexball much. It&#x27;s a great idea, but it depends on your shaving strokes and technique. I mostly go with the grain and mostly up and down two inches, rinse, and repeat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The power feature: A battery is included inside the razor, allowing for the vibration feature.  Switch it on/off as preferred, and it provides additional protection against irritation and possibly a closer shave. I tried using the razor with it on and off, and noticed that I did not cut/bleed or irritate the skin more often when the power was on.  Something about the vibration that protected my skin. The razor runs on the included AAA battery, and it can be replaced by unscrewing the cap at the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comparing this Proglide Power razor to a regular manual Gillette Fusion razor, the first difference is easily the weight. The PP is heavier, thicker in the grip area with much more rubber and ridges for grip, and a half inch longer. The blade placement and head is nearly identical to the manual Fusion. It&#x27;s the same size too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many different razors, including five and six blade razors and the ones with batteries. I really like this razor, but my shaving technique is different than most people. I use an electric razor first, then wet my face continuously for 2 minutes, then shaving gel and let it sit for 2 minutes, then shave. I rarely get cut, even using month-old razors.</li>
    <li> I like the idea, but the blades are only good for a week or so.</li>
    <li> Another razor with over priced blades.  but they work so great!!</li>
    <li> before i would use a hair trimmer but when i tried this it made me change my mind.This razor worked really well when my kids saw me after i shaved they couldnt help but my face.i got this for free courtesy of bzz agent</li>
    <li> Excellent product, GREAT shave! Gillette has put together a great razor here and the shave is close and without cuts. Love the way is moves along my face without having to twist and turn the razor to hit those tough places. Love it! Gillette does a great job with the razors, thanks for continually making it better.</li>
    <li> I was sent this razor to try by the company as part of their product testing and I had some reservations because I prefer a razor that isn&#x27;t powered, but I gave it a shot and here&#x27;s the lowdown on it after using it for a week.&lt;br /&gt;I could shave daily but usually do about every other day, so the first day I used the Fusion Powered Flexball with the vibration on; the second time I used it like a regular razor and the third time I used it with the vibration on again.&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s:  This razor gives the smoothest shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten with either an electric or non-powered razor.  I barely feel the blades move over my face and there is no discernible tugging or pulling at all.  The blade face has two gel pads; one on top and one along the bottom edge and this is what give the razor such a smooth glide over your skin.  The shave is extremely close; my fiance commented on that the first day.  The flexball handle is great; allows for tight turning; I maintain a goatee and it was very easy to get clean lines using the flexball.  The handle is comfortable and doesn&#x27;t slip or turn when I&#x27;m angling it for different areas.  The vibration...the part I was most hesitant about...isn&#x27;t bad at all but I could take it or leave it, honestly.  The shave is close enough that I and my fiance noticed less stubble/5 o&#x27;clock shadow at the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is that the razor feels a little heavy, but this is due to the battery and not a design flaw or really much of an issue at all.&lt;br /&gt;All in all; I will definitely continue to use this razor.  And I will probably grab one without the battery operated vibration for travel as well.  Good product.</li>
    <li> This razor gave me possibly the best shave in my 62 years. Removed all hair first pass. Very pleased. Would recommend to anyone desiring a clean close shave.</li>
    <li> This Gillette razor surpasses any of this type of razor on the market!! It shaves closer than any of  the competitor&#x27;s products available. And I love the fact you can flip it over and trim up my mustache and goatee. I am giving this product 5 stars!!</li>
    <li> I received this new Gillette Fusion ProGlide SilverTouch Manual Razor from Gillette - although I&#x27;ve been using an older Gillette Fusion razor for several years before present. Honestly I wasn&#x27;t expecting a giant difference in performance as my facial hair isn&#x27;t too thick or unmanageable. I was surprised to notice a remarkable difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think rather than the flexball handle (which is nice) the redesigned razor makes the largest impact. I feel now like I&#x27;m just passing the razor over my face without applying any pressure - whereas before I had to pass over the same area several times and apply considerable pressure to achieve a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flexball is also a pretty nice feature, it contours nicely to your face so you don&#x27;t have to think too much about where exactly you will have a non-flat surface to shave over; it is particularly helpful for shaving the area just under your chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design of this product is also pretty damn sexy. It looks like a spaceship is flying over my stubble in the morning. Kudos to that. The rubber gripping is also pretty adhesive while shaving (even in the shower) which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am very happy with this product and would recommend it fully.</li>
    <li> When I got this Razor i was skeptical, but upon using it, both on my face, and body, I noticed it was more efficient. Less time going over the same spot, and especially in odd spots such as the edge of the chin. Overall, not a bad product. not to mention an incredibly close shave.</li>
    <li> Great product! The razor moved and cut with ease. A product I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
    <li> Very flexible for shaving, very nice.</li>
    <li> I was excited to receive a sample from Gillette so I could try their product. I have a spot on my neck that has always been very sensitive, and susceptible to razor burn. I&#x27;ve tried a number of different razors, including some that are supposedly designed for sensitive skin, but still almost always walk around with a big red spot on my neck for a day or so after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first tried the razor, I naturally tried it with the vibration on. I got a remarkably close shave everywhere else, but when I got to the trouble spot on my neck, it didn&#x27;t go as well. I got a big cut, my first shaving cut in years. I was a bit disappointed, but decided I&#x27;d reserve judgment until I had tried it the other way, too: no vibration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took a while before I shaved again. Right after that first attempt, I went on vacation, heading home for my wedding. By the time I finally shaved a second time with the new razor, it was actually on my wedding day, hours before the ceremony. I was really hoping it wouldn&#x27;t cut me or leave a red mark, since I was about to be in dozens of pictures. I tried it without the vibration this time, and I had a smooth, close shave with no issues and NO RAZOR BURN. I have shaved a few times since and it&#x27;s been working great. Some days I use the vibration feature on my face and the other side of my neck, and just turn off the vibration when I get to that tricky spot, but the point is, it&#x27;s been fantastic since then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in short, I really like this razor, but if you have any sensitive spots, you might want to turn the vibration off when you go over them.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch Power Razor by mail to try out from Gillette.  I really like it!  I highly recommend it to anyone.  It&#x27;s quiet and gives a smooth shave.  The floating head followed the contours of my face nicely.  It was a joy to shave with.  I had been using the Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor - non powered.  I also like this razor, but now that I&#x27;ve had a chance to try the Power razor - it has it all over the non powered razor.  Gillette - you do a great job with razors!</li>
    <li> Very good product. I usually shave once a week and with this one I can shave more often without hurting my face!!</li>
    <li> The razor I liked a lot. Having a heavy beard it gave me a close shave. The razor contours to my chin very close and I was impressed with the shave. The razor has a battery so the handle it a bit large. It was worth spending for the razor, I wish the blades  were cheaper. I would buy it again</li>
    <li> Normally I tried to stay away from a traditional razor and always opt for a electric shaver. After trying Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch Power Razor I would switch to the new Gillette Fusion. This razor is gentle on my skin and gives me a precise shave. It is easy to handle and the power ball definitely helps. With other razors I normally would get cuts and an uncomfortable feeling on my skin. I am very pleased with the results from the Power Razor I received from Gillette. I would highly recommend this razor to anyone looking for change and better results,</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this razor my dad got it free from Gillette and I snagged it right up. I love using male razors as most would call them. Razors made for females just don&#x27;t always cut it. I love the flexball technology as it helps get every curve that needs to be shaved. Leaving behind no nicks, cuts, stubble or razor burn is a major plus in my book. I love the precision blade which makes it easy to trim and shape. I have tried other razors but always find myself back to using the Gillette Power Men&#x27;s Razors. I would recommend this razor or any of the Gillette Fusion Razors to people I know.</li>
    <li> I tried this product as a free gift from BzzAgent. I love razors and this one has a very nice appearance. Although it did take me a while to realize where the electric portion of the razor worked, it was a fun experience. The razor was good at shaving smaller facial fair, but it was actually really difficult to shave slightly longer hair along the face. However, the gliding of the razor made it easier to move along the curves of the face.</li>
    <li> Gillete has really done it this time .....I am a middle aged man and have been sportin a bald head for over a year now, and I have to shave literally everyday due to my hair continues to grow in some places. since using the proglide I have noticed that my shave actually last a lot  longer compared when I used other brands.....my facial hair always grows within 12hours, not when I use proglide! I was impressed that I can go without shaving a complete day and half without stubble....truly impressed and love the vibration from the blades on my head ---thought it would be weird but felt good actually. FIVE STARS!</li>
    <li> My husband got tho razor from Gillette and he kind of liked it. He liked the way it was powered and it&#x27;s ability for a close shave. It&#x27;s also great for shaving legs. He did cut himself while shaving but he said it was because the shave was so close and he wasn&#x27;t paying attention. He continues to use it in between going to the barbershop.</li>
    <li> best one I have ever used.........  Easy to use and last longer than any other I have used!</li>
    <li> This is seriously the best razor I have ever used. I received this Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch Power Men&#x27;s Razor from Gillette excited to try a new type of razor that featured the Flexball Handle. It truly makes a difference in the way the razor performs, how close of a shave I get and the confidence I have that it will glide over the edged of my face with out slicing me open :) I have tried many other types of mens razors but I truly think this one is the best of its class so far. It has so many features on it that I think every razor should have, from the lubstrip to the micro pulses this razor has everything a razor needs. I highly recommend this razor and know that those who try it will find that it works awesomely.</li>
    <li> Got this razor directly from company to test for free and its awesome! Fusion ProGlide Power with NEW FlexBall Handle Technology is easy to use and contours directly to the skin because of the flex capability. Love it!!</li>
    <li> Good but not much improvement from last ones. I feel like I&#x27;m getting ripped off from Gillette.</li>
    <li> I received the Fusion Proglide from Gillette to test and was pretty impressed with the results. I usually grow my beard out long and don&#x27;t shave too often so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to. The flexball definitely adds more precision and control to the shave than a standard cartridge razor. Overall I was satisfied with the close shave it provided without irritation to my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This razor is a terrific item. I was not sure if I would like the vibration of the Men&#x27;s Fusion Proglide Silvertouch Power Razor, but it wasn&#x27;t too bad and gave me a very close shave. The blades had good durability and a great battery life. The blades are a bit pricy, but if you wan t a great shave you will get it from this item.</li>
    <li> For anyone who cares to know, this works very well on the face and the scalp...has not found any other product that even comes close in ease and effective use!</li>
    <li> I have used a Mach 3 for over 10 years and purchased this razor after seeing the FlexBall handle on the commercial. This handle grip is good and provides a great close shave. I didn&#x27;t have any big problems with my old Mach 3 but I feel this razor does provide a closer shave. Neither cause me razor burn. I can&#x27;t tell if the vibrating helps any, but I have noticed that the blades do not cut 4 day stubble any better than my old Mach 3.</li>
    <li> Just have to say wow. I tried the Gillete Fusion Proglide Silver Touch razor and it has to be the best razor to move to the shape of your face. I usually use electric, but after how close this razor shaved to my face I have changed my mind. I will continue to use the Gillete Fusion Proglide Silvertouch. I would say if you are looking for a razor that is smooth to your skin, close shave, and moves to the shape of your face try this razor and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is an impressive razor but it&#x27;s a bit too sharp for my taste. The Flexball handle made shaving over contours easier and it&#x27;s true that this razor gives you a closer shave, just be careful that you have a steady hand prior to using it. Other than that; I didn&#x27;t see the vibration as particularly helpful. It&#x27;s a nice touch but it doesn&#x27;t offer much of an added benefit.</li>
    <li> Gillette sent me a ProGlide Power to try for free.  I hadn&#x27;t previously tried any of the many-bladed razors, a couple of years ago I moved from the Atra Plus to using Feather double-edge razor blades in a safety razor.  I wasn&#x27;t sure what difference to expect, but was interested to see the difference.  After trying it for a week, it has been a really nice shaving experience.  The blades follow the contour of my face very well, and even when I press hard, the blades travel smoothly across my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a two-pass technique--the first pass is downstrokes to the jawline and side strokes under the jawline, followed by a second pass of diagonal upstrokes.  The ProGlide Power worked great without changing that technique at all.  The end result has been a very close shave, and it seems to me just about no chance of ever cutting myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the only issue is cost.  The Gillette blades cost 12 times as much as the Feather blades.  I expect a lot of people may not go for the double-edge safety razor experience--I do cut myself with it from time to time, and have to be more careful to avoid doing so with the ultra sharp Feather blades.  I suppose I&#x27;m just kind of cheap that way, looking for blades more in the 27 cents each range.  For the rest of you that are going to buy one of these many-bladed cartridges though, I have no hesitation recommending this one.</li>
    <li> The ball makes this razor work really well!</li>
    <li> I thought the original was epic but now with the pivoting head it allows me to get a closer shave without having to twirl and twist my arm and hands.</li>
    <li> I received the Fusion Proglide Power razor from Gillette as a trial for a review.  I was delighted with the close shave and ease of shaving with the power assist.  I&#x27;ve used a standard Gillette Fusion Proglide and didn&#x27;t think that this new razor would make much of a difference.  Boy, was I wrong!  I generally use my Fusion Proglide razor a few times a week and fill in with my Norelco cordless for quick clean-up.  However, since using this new razor over the past six weeks, I haven&#x27;t used my electric cordless once and continue to feel close shaven after a day or two of using the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power razor.  I have recommended it to friends and will continue to use it from now on.  It far exceeded my expectations.  Thanks Gillette for the opportunity to prove me wrong!!</li>
    <li> Finally! Best, fastest and smoothest head shave in years...! I was using a Mach 3 Sensitive, but switching to This now and recommend to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  all same - cartrige don&#x27;t last and CRAZY EXPENSIVE</li>
    <li> This is a great little razor. I use it as travel blade in my overnight kit, it would work well for a daily shaver.</li>
    <li> Husband loved these razors didn&#x27;t love the replacement price</li>
    <li> It came from USA to me in UK very quickly and wonderfully packaged. The product its self is wonderful. They&#x27;ve done it again.</li>
    <li> It is very nice !  And ship fast .</li>
    <li> Shaves are excellent.  I have a light beard. With this razor, I can get away minimally 2 days (sometimes 3 days) without shaving.</li>
    <li> Great product good close shave. A bit expensive but you get one month per blade use. Shicks version is similar and is just as good. I have tried both and at this point would not recommend one over the other.</li>
    <li> So far, so good.  I think it does work a little better than past models.</li>
    <li> Super nice razor. This gave me the best shave ever!!!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t miss my Mach 3 at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor for three weeks now.  I bought it since it had a rebate on Amazon and I already had used the manual version.  I thought the power version was a gimmick.  However, this is the first razor I&#x27;ve ever used in my life where I did not get torn to shreds the first two times I used it.  The vibrating handle allows me to slowly bring the razor down my face once, maybe twice, and then move on.  Normal trouble areas like my chin are no problem now.  The handle does all the work for me.  With other razors, and I&#x27;ve tried them all like most of you, believe me, everything from the old safety razor and brush to Mach III&#x27;s.  This razor has not cut me yet.  I&#x27;m hoping I can make the blades last a month with some of the tips from other reviews.  My tip is to remember to NEVER shave against the grain.  That&#x27;s a recipe for ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> Smooth feel when shaving</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the fushion power and loved it but this new powerball technology is great</li>
    <li> This is an improvement on the regular ProGlide razor. I find that it is more effective and provides a cleaner shave. However I still find the Mach 3 to provide the best shave. The Fusion and ProGlide blades while thinner, are spaced too close together and after a few shaves get clogged and dull. They do provide a smoother shave over Mach 3 but they need to be replaced more frequently.</li>
    <li> I received this razor from Gillette. It is an awesome product.  I like how it flexes and the vibration stimulates my hair follicles.  I would recommend this razor to anyone.</li>
    <li> Great razor. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Excellent new lproduct for achieving an excellent shave provided that the face is properly prepared for that. When this razor is paired with a glycerin containing shaving cream or one of Gillette&#x27;s new shaving creams, you got yourself an excellent shave.</li>
    <li> Classic fusion razor, with that extra ball that actually works. I got my bear off in less then a minute without struggle to reach some spots</li>
    <li> Fairly good upgrade to the proglide power razor.... The vibrations are soothing and the blades are really good.  The  movement of the ball on the razor head is very smooth - lesser chance for nicks and cuts. Lube strip also lasts longer.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent service from Amazon as always.</li>
    <li> No better than my original fusion razor</li>
    <li> As advertised...very nice and comfortable to use.</li>
    <li> Great razor.  I think a worthy improvement on my past model.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this on kind of a whim -- a vibrating razor -- what a gimmick.  However, it shaves wonderfully!  Nice, close, no nicking.  I get a very good shave with this thing without having to go over the same area several times.  Very nice idea.  I have had no issues with either razor blade longevity, nor battery life.</li>
    <li> Very Good Deal..Always Great Product From Gillette. ..5 Stars! !!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband.  He has used it several times.  He likes it.  He said that it gives him a nice shave, but it takes a little bit to get used to the way it moves on his face compared to a conventional razor.</li>
    <li> Present for my girl friend, so she is not tempted to use mine, hers is better.</li>
    <li> Amazon offered a coupon on this razor so it was reasonably priced.  While it is slightly nicer than my previous Proglide razor, I found the Flexball handle to make only a very minor difference in shaving closeness.  I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this at full price if you already own an older Fusion Proglide -- which were my razor of choice.</li>
    <li> I find this razor system to be a little cheaper than the Schick Hydro 5 system just because there tends to be more promotions ran for Gillette than Schick. So, if your looking to save money just wait until they throw a manufacturers coupon around!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On to the actual razor. This razor definitely gives a closer shave than the Schick and it includes a trimmer razor on the back unlike the Hydro! However, to achieve these results you must be a familiar with good shaving techniques. Just use some old school shaving cream and a badger brush to get a good lather and to raise your hairs. After your skin is loose from a good warm shower first shave with the direction of your hair growth. Then re-lather and shave against the hair. Your skin will be as smooth as a baby&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The negative to this razor is the durability. I find this lasts only four or five shaves before the razors start to tug and make your shave more painful than a waxing! The Schick wins here, because it can last me up to either or nine shaves!</li>
    <li> Just ordered more blades. So smooth so close wow.</li>
    <li> Really smooth shave. I don&#x27;t know why anyone would buy an electric shaver when they can use this gem.</li>
    <li> Best shave ever. No pulling and cannot tell the blade is on your face. Great invention.</li>
    <li> It is very comfortable, but do not expect too much on this. I can&#x27;t feel exclusive difference from older fusion models, though it has outstanding innovative technology. The flexball technology is absolutely innovative.</li>
    <li> This is the best Gillette product . Works well with a light touch.</li>
    <li> This is amazing as when you turn on the battery, you get a very close shave with no pulling of hairs.</li>
    <li> Is a very good product.&lt;br /&gt;The product has to inform good friends</li>
    <li> I have been conducting a long term comparison for over a year, since switching from an electric. I have a good supply of the following, and have been switching every week, and every two weeks for some trials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette Fusion&lt;br /&gt;Dorco Pace 6+Trimmer&lt;br /&gt;Schick Quattro Titanium&lt;br /&gt;Schick Hydro&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Cremo Cream shaving cream. My beard type is very thick,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, the Fusion blades give the closest shave and caused the fewest cuts and nicks. Unfortunately the performance deteriorates rapidly after one week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Schick blades are very good and last for several weeks. Dorcos are good and have good longevity, but not quite as good as Schtick. The nuisance is the cuts and nicks that these all seem to cause.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to stick with Fusion once the other blades run out, planning to change cartridges every 1-2 weeks. It&#x27;s more of an investment but worth it IMO, I&#x27;m done with the electric.</li>
    <li> Very nice item, shave very nicely and fast.</li>
    <li> Until laser guidance is added, this is really the top of the line product available, technologically speaking, from a manual razor. The five blades of the classic Mach Five are here and provide the smooth shave you have always enjoyed. Now in addition you get battery powered vibration to massage your skin and the latest development, a specially devloped rotating ball-like hinge to more easily shave around the contours of your face without contorting your hand/wrist I unnatural ways, what more could you want? I think that carpal tunnel sufferers, or others with decreased mobility may be particularly interested in trying this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Full disclosure: I am reviewing a free sample provided by the manufacturer)</li>
    <li> BEST razor I have ever used (I&#x27;m 79 years old, so I&#x27;ve used quite a few...including the old &amp;#34;single-edge&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;double-edge&amp;#34;). It&#x27;s like a combination electric and regular. I&#x27;m also an engineer...I think it has just the right amount of reciprocating motion frequency as you pull it down...a &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; shaving device.</li>
    <li> Well in terms of the swivel function ?  That is very Neat It follows every contour of your face with ease and I like it but in terms of the sharpness of the Blades ? Not was what I expected, a little rough on my skin, you have to shave slowly because if not, I&#x27;m sure you going to get cut, To Me they have to make better blades and then I give this Item 5 stars.</li>
    <li> i have always been  skeptical of gimmicks with razors but decided to give this a try…WOW i have shaved with it 3 times and am sold on it….i am about to order extra blades and probably will shave more often!</li>
    <li> Great product by a great company</li>
    <li> The reason I&#x27;ve been getting such close shaves without any burn is partly due to this battery powered handle. It does what it&#x27;s designed to do. It makes the hair on your fface stand up, so it can be cut easier, and with less pull.. I haven&#x27;t had mine long enough to see if the battery is going to last long enough to suit my liking. However, it has done a great job up to this point and i&#x27;m satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> I received the new Gillette Fusion Power Glide razor to try for free from Gillette.  I must admit that I was a bit skeptical to try yet ANOTHER razor promising more.  I tried it with several days of growth.  I typically get bad razor bumps from shaving.  Using this razor solved all those problems. I was able to shave without having to use multiple passes to cut all the hair.  The roller-ball motion eliminates the need to become a contortionist trying to get into the nooks and crannies.  Simply put - this is hands down the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used in my life.  I&#x27;m a total convert now.</li>
    <li> This razor is awesome. With the flexball and the battery and the sensitivity strip all makes this product a great toiletry addition. When I use this razor, my skin feels so smooth and it takes less time to shave with the incorporation of the power factor. Also the flexball glides to the contours of my face. I recommend this product to anyone who asks about it and feel very confident to continue with the use of this great razor.</li>
    <li> Around one month ago I had the opportunity to reviewed the new Fusion Proglide Razor with FlexBall handle technology. Handling this razor is very easy and comfortable, I had a good experience I shaved my right and left side with this razor, it was a piece of cake, my only problem was my chin, this razor is so powerful that I must be very careful when I shaved my uneven skin. My final decision, this is a great razor, my experience so far with Gillette razor is really good, and this razor is a piece more of really improved razors.</li>
    <li> I  received this razor to try from  Gillette. With the flexball technology it allowed for the razor to move with the contours of my face, allowiing for a better shaving experience and a closer shaver. I also like that its a power razor which helps with the shave too. This razor also cut down on the usual razor burn I get while shaving. I would definitely recommend giving this excellent razor a try.</li>
    <li> I have been using Gillette razors for many many years now and every time they came up with a new technology I was able to see the difference between old one I was using and new.&lt;br /&gt;This time I feel like Flexball improvement doesn&#x60;t change anything for me. It feels and shaves same as the older one I had.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x60;s still a very good shaver I was just hoping for something bit better</li>
    <li> Received this razor from Gillette. It is a very good razor, but so far I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference between this model with the hinge and the previous one without hinge. This one is definitely heavier, but not awkward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about all these recent models is that it is pretty much impossible to cut yourself. The shave also goes quickly compared to razors with less blades.</li>
    <li> The look I want when I shave is perfection. Not one hair missed in the facial area in the back of the neck. I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of 3 to 5 blade razors before and this new Gillette pro glide is absolutely the last razor I&#x27;ll ever have to buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the curves of my jawline to the areas on my neck that I can&#x27;t see this razor gets it all. Gillette has always strived for the best razors and I think this time they got it.</li>
    <li> I tried the Gillette Proglide Silvertouch Power Razor this morning.  I had a 2 day beard growth and I did not know what to expect. I was very pleasantly surprised.  I got a very close shave with little effort and no nicks.  The vibration was a new experience and seemed to work great.  It seemed like a little lawnmower on my face.  This is the best razor I have ever used and I am 65 years old.G.B.</li>
    <li> i recieved a full size sample via bzzagent . i love this raZor. its amazing with a close shave. very smooth. i wasnt at all worried about cutting myself. the vibration is just right.</li>
    <li> I received one of these, from Gillette in the Mail, via Bzz Agent The Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor took my scraggly facial hair, and made it a smooth shave. The Battery allows the razor to be moving at all times allowing a nice even shave. I recommend this product to new shavers, giving more of a comfortable trim.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m updating this review as it&#x27;s been a while longer with the razor. Gillette provided me with a Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch Power Men&#x27;s Razor With Flexball Handle Technology, and as I&#x27;ve repeatedly used it, I still find it offers a closer shave than my regular fusion. The only concern I have is how quickly it seems that the blade looses its edge. Once the lubricating step wears off, it starts to pull a little and the effect is more noticeable since the contouring of the blade is so well executed. So it&#x27;s still a big thumbs up, but expect to spend some money on replacement cartridges sooner. One last thing, I use this in the shower daily, and I was initially worried about the power feature. Well, it works great and no notable problems with the seal around the battery at all.</li>
    <li> I have never experienced such a smooth shave in my life.  I have tried several razors and the Gillette Fusion Proflide Silvertouch with the Flexaball Handle makes it so much easier to glide over my face.  I will continue to by the Gillette Silvertouch it is really amazing, I could nout believe the closeness of the shae and how soft and smooth it felt.  I use it every day and my mom even tried to take it from me.  I do share, every once in awile.</li>
    <li> Incredible razor!!! I just love it. I&#x27;m a paramedic and I love my job, but the part I hate the most is shaving every day. For years i have tried all kind of different razors; manuals and electrics, I could never find one that will go with the contour of  my face until a couple of weeks ago that I receive a Gillette Fusion Proglide Mens Razor with Flexball from Gillette to try it. Is amazing how easy and fast I shave now. Before is used to take me from 10 to 15 minutes to shave, but with  the Gillette Fusion with Flexiball the last time I shave i did it in 3 minutes. Is incredible how it goes with the contour of my face and  it gives a really smooth and close shave that other razors don&#x27;t really give me unless i keep going over it and over it.</li>
    <li> Full disclosure: I received this product for free, to try and review, from Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, it is a really great razor. I honest expected to \\&quot;feel\\&quot; the pivoting action of the blade more, but the feeling of the blade against my face is pretty typical, I&#x27;d say. I guess the fact that I don&#x27;t feel it is a good thing, meaning it&#x27;s adhering to the contours of my face better. The \\&quot;power\\&quot; element to this razor is fantastic and definitely leads to a much closer shave. This feels like a very premium razor and a decent price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I don&#x27;t give five stars is because, like most razors nowadays, once purchased, you are locked into buying the outrageously expensive replacement heads. I am convinced Gilllette doesn&#x27;t make much money on the razor itself (it&#x27;s pretty cheap) but over time, buying the replacement heads, you end up paying a small fortune for a soft, smooth face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as I said, an excellent razor overall. If you&#x27;re going to be buying replacement heads anyway, might as well buy them for this razor. It&#x27;s top notch.</li>
    <li> I decided to try the Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch Power Men&#x27;s Razor With Flexball Handle Technology, and by far this is the smoothest and closet shave I have experienced.  I love this thing.  I suffer from sensitive skin and bumps, but the flexball handle allows the razor to countour against my skin and go with the grain to avoid irritation. The flexibility allowed me to get in hard to shave areas with no problems and getting all those hard to reach stubs around the neck and cheek bones.  Since the razor is also powered, the added vibration resulted in getting a close smooth shave with less effort.  I highly recommend this razor!</li>
    <li> I recently received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch Power Razor with Track Ball and I could not wait to open the package and use it. Thank you Gillette for letting me try it. I have never felt my face so smooth and quite honestly I was able to shave slightly faster than I do with any other razor. My fiance tried snagging from me and used it around her knees. It&#x27;s rare a woman steals a mans razor because of softness and pleasure to use. I would definitely recommend this razor. Go out and try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed. Keep it up Gillette!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a stickler when it comes to the razor i use to shave my face. I have always been a fan of Gillette because it seems they have always been ahead of everyone else when it comes to blade technology. The previous razor i used was the Gillette Fusion Proglide and I thought it couldn&#x27;t get any better, until I tried the new Fusion Proglide with Flexball. I have never had such a clean cut free shave without having to spend tons money at the barbershop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this razor to anyone who wants a clean cut free shave at an amazing price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Razor was given to me to review by Gillette.</li>
    <li> I wrote my initial review on my wife&#x27;s account. Cindy Edwards&lt;br /&gt;This is my update after using the razor for a little over a week and as stated before I received the product from the brand, goit it free to review. It was not purchased GOT IT FREE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product mainly for shaving my head on mornings, I find it more responsive and allows the closest, smoother shave.&lt;br /&gt;I am still maintaining my 5 star review because of the reasons in my original review. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I am always looiking for a shaver that will give me a close shave without irritating my sensative skin.  I have found such a razon in the Gillette Fusion Proglive Silvertouch Power razor.  All I had to do was to turn on the power and shave.  I experienced the closet shave without any irritation.  I have experimented and have shaved with the Silvertouch not using shaving cream.  I experience the same results.  For an effortless shaving experience the Silvertouch is absolutely the razor to own.  Could not be without it.</li>
    <li> When i got the razor from Gillette to try i thought how much better will this be over any other razor? I have to say i was quite impress with it Over all, great razor got the job done fast with no nicks and my face felt great after.Very Happy with it.</li>
    <li> Gillette Fusion Proglide Power razor.  This was a replacement for my old one.  My first one lasted about 10 years and each blade will last several weeks with the vibration action.  The blades are expensive (5 blades in each cartridge), but they last much longer than others.</li>
    <li> Great shave, It would be nice if it had different levels of vibration. So far continues to give a great shave after two weeks.</li>
    <li> I got this razor in the mail a few weeks ago. The overall appearance is flashy and appealing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It appears to be your standard battery vibration setup that Gillette introduced a while back. IT is a reliable function and seems to help.  I like the look of the flex ball handle, but do not find myself needing it for everyday facial shaving.  I also found the replacement blades to be very expensive.  I get a similar shave quality with a double edge razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gillette razor is a reliable and effective product.  It always gives a good shave as I expected.  Possibly the flex ball would be more suited to removing hair from other parts of your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all this is a great product, but not sure the new flex ball is worth the upgrade for people using a power glide razor already.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used the Mack 3 razor that I received from Gillette when I registered for selective service.  The flexball and micropulses are a nice touch and I can definitely tell a difference when shaving.  The process is definitely faster and Gillette always seems to be at the forefront when it comes to innovation and the changes this time around are definitely functional versus cosmetic.  While I think that the changes are nice to have, I don&#x27;t think that they would be enough to change razors, especially given the additional cost, which is the the reason for the lack of the final star.</li>
    <li> I recently received the Gillette Proglide Razor with the Flexball Handle Technology to try , Sleek design it looks really cool, I love the silver look and the hints of blue and packaging. I loved how easy it was to open the Unlike most plastic casings, no scissors required&lt;br /&gt;I can say that this razor  is better than the regular Proglide. The swivel rocking head works great and adjusts to the contours of your face perfectly, especially under your neck and the side of your chin area just below your ear These razors give an excellent shave. Love the razor.</li>
    <li> great razor. smooth shave and i like gillette products a lot but I am not sure I would actually buy this without getting a free sample due to the cost.  I just don&#x27;t like paying a lot for razors and really not sure the power feature is worth the extra cost.</li>
    <li> My husband used this razor only a few times before he finally lost his patience with it and threw it away.  He says the head of it is too floppy and does not conform to your face; therefore, it is impossible to get a good close shave.  He had to keep taking it off of his face and readjusting it in order to get a decent shave.  He says it being battery powered did not make a differnce in how poorly it shaves.  I cannot recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> I was already a Gillette user and fan before I received the new Fusion Progilde with Flexball Handle. Frankly, I did not expect that the new design and the additional blade would make much of a difference. I was happily surprised when I used it the first time (and every other time since) at how close the shave is and how much better it really is. I had read an article speculating that adding a fifth blade was some sort of razor marketing arms race, and I don&#x27;t know how much that additional blade makes a difference or how much is the result of the roller ball, I just know that this is a great razor that produces a great shave. The razor has some weight to it...it feels solid, and I like that. It really does get a close shave without razor burn or nicks. Now I just need to find a good home for the old blades I just bought...because I do not want to go back to my old razor.</li>
    <li> Throughout my life I see inventions and I sit back and think, why didn&#x27;t someone think of that before? Spray pancake batter, Toasters that toast things into the side of your toast, that where&#x27;s my droid app that helps you locate lost phones. All genius ideas that once they came out I was like, duh! How did I not think of that. This is one of those products. You know, for years all we had were straight razors, which were nice if you knew what you were doing with them, which I assume most of the population didn&#x27;t since they went to the barber for a shave. Then came disposable razors, but it only flexes a little bit and only up and down, not left and right. Then some brilliant engineer at Gillette (I assume he&#x27;s an engineer, engineers think up all the cool stuff) sat down and was like, why on earth do I only get two directions when I could have four. 22 minutes, and 6 cups of coffee later the prototype was born. Granted that initial prototype was probably a razor blade strapped to a tennis ball and I&#x27;m sure that engineer tried it and ended up in the ER, but then a bunch of engineers got together and perfected it. And thanks to that ER visit, those 6 cups of coffee, and that engineer, we have this bad boy. This will revolutionize the way you shave. Probably. Looking for them to add wifi and facebook connectivity in the next one. Maybe a touchscreen as well and a bluetooth module.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR I really like the razor. It&#x27;s my new go to razor. No complaints really, well except the vibration function that I don&#x27;t like but plenty of other people like it.</li>
    <li> The ball swivel noticibly increases blade/skin contact. A much closer and more comfortable shave compared to the earlier fixed head Fusion.</li>
    <li> This razor truly does a great job.  The added weight in the handle combined with the track ball provided an above average shave.  I experienced no pulling and appreciated the ability to get around the chin without lifting. A very very nice product.</li>
    <li> Seems to get a slightly better shave then the non-flexball version of this razor. Definitely heavier, but not a big deal at all.</li>
    <li> Excellent Razor!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For many years I have used an electric razor because it gave me the closest shave without the harsh after-effects of razor burn. I came to use my trusty electric razor after using all types of razors with trial and error.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just like most men, I started with the disposable razor cartridges which worked well, but gave extreme razor burn and had to go over the same section of my face multiple times to get all hairs. I went through numerous brands and models in the disposable cartridge category.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to my sensitive skin, I was eager to try an electric razor after being referred to a certain one from a friend. Although the electric razor did alleviate my razor burn, it did not get as close of a shave as the cartridge razors. Again, I tried many different styles of electric razors: three-foil,  rotary, wet/dry, you name one... I tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all those attempts, I figured I would stick with a three-foiled, wet/dry electric razor that did the job and prevented razor burn. Although I had to use it a couple times a day on some days, I stayed away from the cartridge razor since. Until...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally tried the GILLETTE FUSION PROGLIDE SILVERTOUCH POWER RAZOR. All I have to say now is WOW! Since using this razor, I can now get an extremely close shave without the razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch Power Razor gives an extremely close shave with only having to use one swipe. The vibrations that the Fusion Proglide Silvertouch Power razor gives off simulates the way an electric razor stimulates the hairs on my face. This allows the blades to cut the hair as close to the skin as possible. The pivot ball on the Fusion Proglide Silvertouch Power Razor follows the contours of my face which allows me to swipe only once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An added bonus on this razor is the trimming blade which allowed me to trim my sideburns in a straight line (for once). Now if there was a feature of this razor to make my sideburns level and even, it would be perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have to say that this is an excellent razor! All in all, I have now found my regular razor for the foreseeable future.</li>
    <li> Gillette sent me this razor to try out and review recently. I&#x27;ve been using the same two blade Gillette Sensor razor for probably 20 years, so I&#x27;m glad I could try out something new. Overall, I&#x27;m impressed.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* Smooth! Turn on the power and this thing just glides across your skin remarkably well. It feels almost as if it &amp;#34;floats&amp;#34; on your skin. I imagine the vibration somehow does this.&lt;br /&gt;* Fast * I only shave 2-3 times a week, so I&#x27;m a little scruffy by the time a shave. With my old double blade, that means a lot of time going over and over the same areas to catch missed spots. This one gets it clean in one or two passes.&lt;br /&gt;* Agile * I was surprised how easy the flexball makes it to maneuver around my chin and jaw.&lt;br /&gt;* Safe * Between the smooth and agile, I never get even the slightest hit of a tug or nick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;* Cost * It looks like the replacement cartridges will cost about twice as much as my old sensor ones (but then you get 2.5 times as many blades on the cartridge :)&lt;br /&gt;* Durability * With my sparse schedule, I can go about a month with the sensor blades before replacing. These, only a couple of weeks. I think they are thinner and sharper, so they dull faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great product! The time savings and smoother shave are probably worth the extra cost.</li>
    <li> I have yet to use a fusion pro glide razor and get a bad shave so I was excited to receive one with a flexball handle free from Gillette. As expected the razor provided me with the closest shave out of any razor I&#x27;ve used. That being said I have yet to feel any difference in the gimmicky additions Gillette makes to the standard fusion pro glide. The pulsing did not make a difference when shaving and I could not tell any advantage with having a the flexible head. To me this all seems like a marketing ploy to sell more razors.</li>
    <li> i dont see any difference between using this or proglide, dont waste money on it if you already got proglide.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Rusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall Handle Technology is the most unique razor I&#x27;ve ever seen.  No other razor has the flexibility to cover (and closely shave) the contours of your neck and face like this razor does.  Unlike other razors, this one maintains contact with your face and neck the entire time that you are shaving.  This razor is the next step in shaving technology. Full Disclosure: I received this razor from the manufacturer for product-testing.</li>
    <li> I have been using Gillette products for a long time and i am very satisfied with this product. I would recommend this product to anyone. It has a nice pivoting end on it and leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth and leaves no irritation. Very great product!</li>
    <li> Great razor for on the go but not as close as I would like.  I was given an opportunity to try this product from Gillette. I was excited to try it.  It&#x27;s very easy to use. The flexible handle is nice for control but it doesn&#x27;t give as close of a shave as I would like. However for traveling this razor would be great as it is small and easy to transport.</li>
    <li> Best razor available, IMO.</li>
    <li> this product is very good the product glide very smoothly i recieve my razor from the company gillette themself but i would give this a 5 star</li>
    <li> I have been shaving for many, many years.  I have tried lots of different razors and I must say that this one is the best!  I get a very close, smooth shave and no nicks or razor burn.  I got this razor as a free sample from Gillette for review.  Thanks Gillette.  My search for the perfect razor is finally over.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty nice razor. I have extremely sensitive skin and have trouble using certain razors, and this new proglide was one of the most comfortable shaving experiences that I can remember. For the longest time I&#x27;ve been using safety razors but having used this one for a little while I am tempted to continue buying cartridges. I&#x27;m not totally certain that I would choose this batter-powered version over the regular flexball gillette as I didn&#x27;t think that it did much more than tickle my skin, but perhaps that will change after I&#x27;ve used it for a few more weeks. Overall this really is a good razor and if you have sensitive skin like mine I doubt you&#x27;ll find a better solution at this price point.</li>
    <li> The razor seems really smooth but I noticed some drag from the blades. My next shave was used with my regular safety razor with the Gillette Platinum blade and I much preferred that shave to the prior one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will still use the blades until they are out and will use this blade when traveling as it&#x27;s easier to travel with.</li>
    <li> Having used the regular fusion for awhile now I decided to give this a shot. This is a slight upgrade from the fusion. As advertised the razor does get the \\&quot;tough to shave\\&quot; parts of the face pretty well and with great ease. The \\&quot;Flexball\\&quot; technology does give this razor a slight advantage over other razors. The shave is smooth and quick, and makes shaving a little easier in the morning. I would recommend this product anyone that&#x27;s looking for a well made razor that does the job with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample of this product from Gillette to try and use.</li>
    <li> Very Very Nice!! I was expecting a normal razor, nothing special, but then I used it. WOW it was a perfect close shave i have been looking for. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s for everyone, but it definitely works for me. Thanks Gillette, and BzzAgent for allowing me to find out about this amazing product.</li>
    <li> I do enjoy the razor from the company. I just don&#x27;t seem very usefull the flexball, I haven&#x27;t really felt that i need that additional movement from the razor when shaving, I think it would of been okay without the flexball and stayed as the previous version for the Gillette razor.  But over all I enojy my product.</li>
    <li> So, I received the Fusion ProGlide Silvertouch with Flexball Handle from bzzagent for free.  In return, I am reviewing the razor for the whole world to see.  A little background.  I only shave a couple times a week, and actually took this on vacation with me for the testing and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like this razor very much.  It fits nicely in the hand, is easy to control, the vibrating is not excessive as to cause any problems while shaving, and it&#x27;s actually pretty quiet in the hand as well.  I used it twice during my vacation (had a blast, thanks for asking).  Each time, the razor delivered a close, smooth shave with a minimum of going over areas again.  I would recommend this razor to anyone that like a smooth, easy shave.  My wife even used it on her legs after we returned home, and she thinks it works very nicely for women as well.  The 4-Star rating is for the cost of replacement blades, but that is an issue with all razors.</li>
    <li> Wow! I&#x27;m so glad that I purchased this Razor ... so easy to use ... super close shave ... no skin razor cuts for me ... purchase delivered to my home right on schedule.</li>
    <li> I usually have to shave every 2-3 days. With that being said, I found this razor to be okay. I didn&#x27;t find the battery-operated gizmo to be very necessary and think that you could really do without that aspect of it. Also, I don&#x27;t recommend this razor for someone learning how to shave for the first time. It has a good cut. The trimmer is fine without the power added to it; I was kind of afraid to use the trimmer with the power on it for fear of tearing some skin off. The proglide portion of it takes some getting used to but all in all I think this is a good razor.</li>
    <li> We received this product free from Gillette for this review.    I had switched to an electric razor but after using this, I am back to using a hand-held razor. This is a very smooth cut, no pulling, no burning afterwards. Comfortable to hold, easy to clean. We&#x27;ll see how durable the cutter is and how long the batteries last but I would recommend this razor since it is now my razor by choice. Directions would be nice to check on newer features.</li>
    <li> As Gillette has continually improved their razors over the years, I&#x27;ve moved right along with them.  But since this uses the same blades as the previous generation, I was somewhat skeptical that the &amp;#34;flexball&amp;#34; would make a difference.  I was wrong.  The blades swivel and hug your skin as if they were magnetized, resulting in a quicker shave without the need to repeat strokes.  I am highly satisfied, and if shaving can be enjoyed, this is the closest I&#x27;ve found so far to the perfect shave.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide with flexball as a trial from Gillette!  I&#x27;m hooked!  I have been a fan of the older version without the flexball for several years now.  The addition of the flexball improves this product that I didn&#x27;t know could be improved!  Wow.  Very close shave and cuts a few seconds off of my shave time because I don&#x27;t have to go back over certain areas anymore.  This also causes less irritation.  The only thing that I don&#x27;t like is that it no longer comes with an upright stand. The upright stand helped it dry quicker.  AMAZING PRODUCT!!!</li>
    <li> I received this razor and handle as a free promotional item through Gillette, so that I can write an honest on review it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It&#x27;s a nice upgrade to the previous Proglide that didn&#x27;t have the Flex ball. I really like the razor and the multi-blade style head. It provides a great, clean shave. I have pretty thick coarse hair, and this just glides right through it. (no pun intended) Like the previous versions, I feel like the head itself is a bit too tall, making the first couple uses awkward. After a couple of shaves, it was awesome. I do wish that the blades were a little longer lasting.&lt;br /&gt; My wife stole this from me as soon as she could and absolutely loved it. The flexball made a huge difference on shaving the contours of her legs and ultimately gave her a quicker, smoother, more comfortable shave. I really liked the old pro-glide and wouldn&#x27;t upgrade unless I needed to replace my old handle. But, my wife says that this Proglide with the Flexball technology is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> This was a very good product and has kept up with the standards the gillette tries to amount to. the blades are well designed and the fact the ball can move from side to side helps with the ability to get a closer shave. The only downside is this takes batteries and I found that the vibration did nothing short of feel someone nice and funny on my face. This is why I gave it a 4/5. There is no necessity for the vibrations or for the power and certainly no need for you to replace the batteries. It is more of a soft massage and doesn&#x27;t help with the ability for a closer shave. If you want to shave closely, go against the grain and save the money for replaceable blades instead of batteries.</li>
    <li> Gillette sent me this razor to try out. I have really sensitive skin so the first time that I used the razor, I was scared to push hard enough to make the razor pivot. Because of that, the angle seemed awkward. It was not until my wife used it on her legs and she noted the pivoting action that I tried it again. Once I realized that it moves easily and does not need a lot of pressure to get a close shave, I fell in love. I have a very angular face so the original reason for the pivoting is perfect for me. Of course, I feel a little silly that I did not figure out how to work the blade right away but I am better now.</li>
    <li> Gillette sent me this razor to try out. I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in the closeness of the shave from the regular Proglide razors that I normally use.  The pivot ball seemed awkward but I guess I was not pressing hard enough on it.  My wife used it on her legs and she said it gives her a nice close shave and doesn&#x27;t get cuts on her shins and ankles. I think if they made a power version of this razor it would be great.</li>
    <li> This is truly an amazing product!! Thanks again bzzagent for the trial!!!</li>
    <li> Great shave and worth the 12 bucks.  After all I shave everyday.  I change the blade once per  month and shave everyday.</li>
    <li> First, let me start by saying I absolutely LOVE Gillette and am excited that Gillette decided to send me a free sample. Several years back, after experimenting with electric razors and standard blades alike, I settled back on the basic old handle w/ disposable blades. For the past couple of years I&#x27;ve been using a Gillette Mach 5, and been quite happy with it. One of the reasons / main use cases is that I like to shave in the shower (with shower mirror) and get it all done then vs. hanging over my sink. I got my hands on the Fusion Proglide a few weeks back to try out, and I must say I really like it. I tend to shave every 1-2 days (often aligned to customer meetings :) and am finding that the FP works very well in my morning routine, holds its own in the shower, and actually enables me to get a nice clean, close shave with only going over my face once. This is in contrast to the blade I&#x27;d been using, where I typically had to do one direction and then again reverse (against the grain) after to get it nice and smooth. Overall, very pleased with this device and can see myself using it for a long while</li>
    <li> I thought this looked a bit gimicky, but the swivel ball and even the battery power really do help.  I&#x27;ve been using the old fusion for over a year, and misplaced it (I ended up finding it, and still use it for travel, but actually notice a degradation when using the old one).</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t&#x27; noticed a difference from previous versions.</li>
    <li> Gives a great shave, it contours to your face when you shave so that it never misses the hard to reach spots, one of the first razors I have had that do that very effectively! This is very sensitive for your skin, anbd the trimmer is great for the stubble or loose hairs that are left, or as it says, trimming. Razor cuts are almost non existant with this razor, which is great.</li>
    <li> This time Gillette struck gold! When I received the razor from Gillette it looked space age but when I shaved with it was heaven. I&#x27;m hispanic so my facial hairs are not perfectly straight especially around the neck area, so when I used the razor it was amazing how I can go for longer strokes with out pulling out. It cuts close to the skin around the chin and with the vibrating it&#x27;s effort less. You really don&#x27;t have to reposition your self to get to tight corners or spots the &amp;#34;flex ball does it all&amp;#34;! My only flip side is how long it last. For the money it should give me a month at least. You feel the dragging after about 3 weeks. But over all good job Gillette.</li>
    <li> No significant improvement over previous model. But, still a good razor.</li>
    <li> Awesome Razer. I&#x27;ve owned this model and the one before this without the flex ball.  I can really tell the difference with this one compared to the last model I owned. It&#x27;s a great razor, I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone looking for a Power Razor.</li>
    <li> I have used a blade for as long as I can remember since electric shavers just don&#x27;t shave close enough.  I have also used Gillette razors as my stable for the everyday shave.  When Gillette came out with the Silver touch I was intrigued.  After using it for about a month, I had mixed feelings in the beginning as I wasn&#x27;t sure I liked the vibrations.  However, after a month of use I have noticed a closer shave with a lot less time invested.  With a very busy schedule and shaving not high on my list of things I enjoy doing...the Silver touch has saved me time and came through with a close shave!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Gillette!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have used Gillette for a long time and watched them go from Mach 3 all the way to Fusion Proglide. This razor has got to be their best yet. It really hugs the contours of my face and is a delight to use with its superior razor glide. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best razor I have ever used!  Thank you Gillette for inventing this and making a real chore a lot easier and safer.</li>
    <li> When I received this ptoduct free to try from BzzAgent I honestly thought it was going to be like any other razor blade I&#x27;ve ever tried but boy was I surprised. First off the handle is heavy but definitely not uncomfortable to use. The flexball is amazing and helps to contour every part of your face. It gave me a really smooth shave without and tug and pull. The razor is sooo good I had to start hiding it from my wife.</li>
    <li> First, I got this razor free from Gillette to test out. Second, Best Razor Ever! I have super sensitive skin so if I have to go over it more than once, you can bet that I&#x27;ll have shave bumps. Not with the &amp;#34;Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch Power Men&#x27;s Razor With Flexball Handle&amp;#34;.  One swipe with this razor that seems to be magnetized to my skin and every trace of a beard was gone! Love the vibrating handle and the precision line cutting tip. Will be buying replacement cartridges for sure!! Seriously, if you have hair and you need it gone, then this is the razor for you!!</li>
    <li> I was using the Mach 3 razors already.  Never used the power razors at all.  Mach 3 was already great, so why pay more?  Well, Gillette sent me this razor with the FlexBall Handle and it&#x27;s powered.  Such an amazing difference.  I get a close, comfortable shave every time I use it! I don&#x27;t have to keep going back over the same spot multiple times.  It&#x27;s very effective! Will continue to use!!!</li>
    <li> Let me first start off by saying that I am a black male who does not use razors often to shave because I suffer from razor bumps.  I usually use electric shavers for the reason of razor bumps. So, when I received the Fusion ProGlide Power with NEW FlexBall Handle Technology by Gillette I was a little skeptical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received the product in the mail, I decided to give it a try.  First thing first, the directions on using the new product are terrible.  No proper directions were given at all; however, it is shaving so I guess they assumed that all men shaved before.  After I used the product, I have to admit that I experienced a very close shave.  This was one of the closest shave I had in a long time.  Experiencing a close shave was not my concern, but the development of razors bumps.  To my surprise, two days after shaving, no razor bumps.  This is a pleasant surprise and I will probably continue to use the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One improvement that Gillette could make for this product is to actually include proper directions.  Once proper directions are incorporated, I will probably give this product 5 stars.</li>
    <li> It was just a matter of time before a vibrating razor would hit the market.  Now my collection is complete.  I have a vibrating toothbrush, a vibrating dental scaler. a vibrating chair, vibrating knife, and now a vibrating razor.  My first thought was what a total gimmick this is. But after trying it, I am converted. So much so that I am going to buy anything that vibrates..well almost anything (Amazon does sell those items too, in case you were wondering).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My concern was that if you start to vibrate a sharp blade, wouldn&#x27;t it result in a greater chance of cutting yourself? But to my delight, it does not.  It actually results in a smoother shave that helps to produce an effortless glide over your shaving surface. Think of it as air hockey on your face. I also found that it reduced the amount of irritation. Not that I am sadistic, but I even went as far to try it out sans shaving cream. Not that I would do that again, but it really proved that you get far less irritation with this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also really like that you can change out the one AAA battery so that way you don&#x27;t have to buy another razor or go to the store to get special sized batteries.  Well done, Gillette, well done.</li>
    <li> Blades seems to dull much more quickly than they used to.  I loose the close shave even after a few neck cleanups (not even full shaves)</li>
    <li> I was already a big fan of the Gillette Fusion razors, but the new FlexBall handle really makes my face do a little happy dance!  I love when a company improves an already good thing, and let&#x27;s face it, sometimes shaving can be boring.  This new little twist gave me just the pep I needed to enjoy shaving a little more!  I received this as part of a promotion from the manufacturer, but my review would stand regardless.</li>
    <li> I have been using Gillette all my adult life and this razor by far is the finest yet. I use it in the shower with  shaving soap and I find that I shave much faster and one pass with this razor. very happy with it since it follows all the contours of an aging beard.</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t use any other razor after trying this one.</li>
    <li> I can only say that I regret bought it</li>
    <li> Was given a free Proglide w/ flexball technology from Gillette for a trial. Excellent technology.  You can definitely tell the difference on how the razor glides over your face.  I&#x27;ve never been a fan of the actual Gillette razors, but the dynamic handle takes away most of the discomfort I&#x27;ve experienced previously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is definitely worth a shot, and this is coming from a loyal Schick user.</li>
    <li> Seriously, until a razor company bites the bullet and comes out with a ceramic razor we are only going to see tiny little improvements in multi-blade shave technology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So as far as I can tell the blade technology is the same, which is the Fusion Proglide.  Which is the latest and greatest at the moment.  Read the product description and Gillette bloviate son how great it is.  And it is in my opinion the best shave in the business at this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what do we get with this shaver then?  Well this is a powered shaver, meaning the handle and therefore razor vibrates, which is supposed provide a smoother less irritating shave.  This handle also comes with a chip that keeps the vibrations, or micropulses, as a consistent rate the whole time, so that as battery wears down the shave does not get diminished. Instead the vibrations will just stop and light will indicate the battery needs to be changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other big feature is that now along with the shave head tilting up and down which we have had for a long time, head of the razor can tilt side to side by a few degrees, so in theory the razor blades can follow the contours of your faces more closely, providing less irritation and a closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I used this did I notice a difference…..no.  Is there a chance that it can provide a closer shave…..yes.  Is it is a big improvement over the previous Gillette razor…..no.  Is it still the best handheld multi-blade razor on the market today…..yes.  So if you need a new razor then yes give this one a try, if you old Fusion is working fine….then just stick with it.  No essential need to upgrade here.</li>
    <li> Typically an electric shaver person, but decided to give this a try. Got it straight from Gillette. Amazingly close shave. While the whole vibration thing might seem a little gimmicky I have to admit I&#x27;m a true believer. I would definitely recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> This is a great close clean shaving razor. I was a little hesitant about the battery operated hand held ( have only used electric trimmers) very happy.&lt;br /&gt;Close with out the burn, clean and even no need to re-shave for two days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;very happy would reccomend!</li>
    <li> I received this directly from Gillette, and am satisfied with it for a few reasons. The Flexball system provides adequate resistance to prevent unintentional sliding of the blade, and does allow for a more effective angle against the skin. The single blade on the back for precision cuts appears to have been mildly mproved as well.</li>
    <li> Received the razor from Gillette to try. I generally don&#x27;t shave since i left the army but this razor is great. I&#x27;ve got the one that pulsates.  Personally don&#x27;t like using the razor with pulsating on during shaving but like using the pulsation to help finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flexball is great as it really does contour along your face and would greatly recommend this razor to anyone.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a pretty great razor. Very smooth and accurate and it helps due to the fact that I sensitive skin. The vibration doesn&#x27;t really make much of a difference though but overall, I&#x27;ve enjoyed it and I hope the blades are not expensive.</li>
    <li> Very nice razor.  Better than the straight fusion and better than the competition.</li>
    <li> Got it for my wife who has been using disposable razors for too long. I used to have a mach 3 in normal and turbo and powered versions, and the powered version makes all the difference. It even took off a small mole she had under her arm without her even knowing it. You should shave a sleeping bear with this thing and the bear wouldn&#x27;t even know you were there.</li>
    <li> Been a while since I wanted to pick up a razor been using power shavers for a long time.  But shaver finally died and wanted to check out these multi bladed razors.  Picked this one up and wasn&#x27;t disappointed, however could use more explaining on how it all works thought the power part with trimmer was kind of like a bear trimmer but the power part makes the razor act almost like a shaver.  Good product if your thinking about switching from a electric shaver go here.</li>
    <li> Im 52 and figured I have seen everything when it comes to shaving.  This thing is awesome!!  Works so well that you don&#x27;t even need shaving cream.  I would Highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> The Best Price you can get in INDIA</li>
    <li> Substantially better than it predecessor. The power system works better and battery lasts longer.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this razor has made my shaving easier.</li>
    <li> Buy this on sale - those who have sensitive skin - it helps.</li>
    <li> Wow this is a great razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve become cynical about razors- it seems like each new generation is just another excuse to raise prices, add blades, include batteries- anything in the quest for more and more profit.  These cretins know that we have whiskers that grow EVERY SINGLE DAY.  Many of us have rebelled, choosing to grow beards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m no lumberjack, however, and my flirtation with beardedness only lasted a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So back I am, to razors.  And this one is amazing!  The ball mechanism does indeed make for a better shave because you know what, my head isn&#x27;t flat like a board!  This thing glides around the curves and gives a tight shave without pain or irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m writing this, but this one is actually worth the money.</li>
    <li> I received one from Gillette to try out and see how I liked it.  First of all, I have a tuff bead and a tender face.  I have tried dozens of manual as well as several electric razors and NONE have ever given a better shave than this new Gillette Fusion Power with the Flexball handle.  I have used it over two weeks and it is still like new and gives me a great looking comfortable shave.  I believe the Flexball handle with the battery powered razor is the difference for me getting the best shave ever.  I will get me some refills as soon as I need them and will continue to use this razor.  Yes, I am really impressed.</li>
    <li> When I got selected to try this razor as part of a bzzcampaign for bzzagent I was hesitant. I have very thick facial hair and it&#x27;s hard to find a good razor. But I was blown away by the results. It glides effortlessly over my face, and gives me a clean shave without nicks or pulling my hair. I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> My husband liked this but for the price it doesn&#x27;t really seem worth it. If it was a little cheaper I could see buying it again.</li>
    <li> Improved over the last model. Doesn&#x27;t plug up as much and a lot easier to clean out. Last model was really hard to clean the hair out of. If you didn&#x27;t like the last one, I would recommend trying this one. Longevity is good.</li>
    <li> it was ok, but prefer the non-motorized razors. thanks</li>
    <li> Noticed better shave and the blades are lasting longer with this new swivel head.</li>
    <li> Best Gillette shaver so far. Close shave without cuts.</li>
    <li> I ordered this after accidentally leaving behind my razor (a basic Fusion Proglide, non Silvertouch) when I went to visit family for a couple of weeks. I was not expecting to like it, but it is noticeably more comfortable than I older Proglide, and I find the vibration option does make the shave smoother - i feel less pulling of hairs when shaving, especially if I had let it go for a few days.</li>
    <li> I got a free sample of this razor from Gillette, but I had used it long before that, and have been a fan of the ProGlide razor before the freebie.  One razor blade lasts me half a year (I only shave twice a week, admittedly). And it does a great job compared to the disposable razors. For somebody like me who only shaves rarely it&#x27;s surely worth having a nice razor like this given how long it lasts.  The Flexball part seems weird to me, but doesn&#x27;t get in the way, either.</li>
    <li> I got the GILLETTE® FUSION PROGLIDE RAZOR &amp; 2-IN-1 SHAVE GEL for free from Gillette through BzzAgent and wanted to tell you what I thought. The razor was perfect. No joke. It contours to the face, not a single nick, and a really smooth shave. You don&#x27;t realize how much time you spend shaving until it takes half the time with a better razor. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> all i can say about this product is ........ Smooooooth</li>
    <li> GOOD。I like it very much.</li>
