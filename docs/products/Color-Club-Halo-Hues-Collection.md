      <li>Love the color.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping ,great seller.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty but very similar to the cloud nine color, which is why I gave it 3 stars, it&#x27;s good polish, it glides on with one coat and is beautiful in the sun</li>
      <li>Chips easily.</li>
      <li>but it chips easily....  </li>
      <li>The holo is so beautifully strong.</li>
      <li>You only need two coats of this polish to get the BEAUTIFUL holographic effect.</li>
      <li>Very pretty - Love the way it looks -</li>
      <li>I like having a little something on hand to reward them for their good behavior and as a reminder of good times with grandma.</li>
      <li>I really love it, and it&#x27;s not crazy out there, so you can wear it anywhere.</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth like a dream.</li>
      <li>This polish goes on smoothly.  </li>
      <li>I love this holographic nail polish-it is so pretty.</li>
      <li>I hope your day is as special as you all are.</li>
      <li>I had my doubts about this color, but it does shine holographically in the right light.</li>
      <li>quickly also.</li>
      <li>The holographic is not as distinct as with the silver one.</li>
      <li>So pretty, I have to hide it from granddaughters</li>
      <li>Inside it is still pretty.</li>
      <li>I never fail to get compliments when I wear this nail polish.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d buy more in different colors though.</li>
      <li>Miss Bliss is a very pretty color, but when swatched alongside the others, it doesn&#x27;t have nearly the holo-ey goodness as some of the others.</li>
      <li>People notice it even from a distance when I wear this particular shade!</li>
      <li>so I can really see the holograph.</li>
      <li>Really shows it self off.</li>
      <li>Thanks to all employees at amazon</li>
      <li>This is more of a light red than pink.  </li>
      <li>Wears very well.</li>
      <li>I really like this color and the fact that it is a &amp;#34;vegan&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>The base colors are beautiful, and the fire in the holo is stunning.</li>
      <li>No need to do multiple coats, covers pretty well on the first one.</li>
      <li>This is by far the prettiest nail polish I have seen!!</li>
      <li>It was pretty anyway, just different than I thought.</li>
      <li>It looks great under artificial lights, and in the sun it just explodes in rainbows of color.</li>
      <li>but I expected something more pink.</li>
      <li>I wish you could see this, The big color picture of the pink color is an accurate representation of it, on my screen.</li>
      <li>I did a watermarble with black and it looked soooo cool.</li>
      <li>The polish is an easy two coater (maybe one, if it&#x27;s thick) and wears well.</li>
      <li>A pale creamy pink, which can be paired with a glitter gloss on top for an extra look.</li>
      <li>Actually I now know what little gift items I can keep on hand for them for a special day or even the for the average day.  </li>

    <li> Goes on smooth like a dream. Really shows it self off. Very lovely color too. And can see myself using this color any season.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty but very similar to the cloud nine color, which is why I gave it 3 stars, it&#x27;s good polish, it glides on with one coat and is beautiful in the sun but I expected something more pink. It would be five stars if I was happy with the shade.</li>
    <li> Love the color. It came quicker than expected. Have had several comments on the color when I am out and about. Wears very well.</li>
    <li> This polish is amazing to put it lightly. It is so pretty and shiny and is perfect with just one coat!! You need this color it&#x27;s beautiful!!!</li>
    <li> Wife purchased this. The holographic is not as distinct as with the silver one.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I thought it was more pinkish but it was more towards brownish. It was pretty anyway, just different than I thought. It went on very nice and lasted 4 or 5 days before looking worn. I&#x27;d buy more in different colors though.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color. I never fail to get compliments when I wear this nail polish. It&#x27;s just so pretty!&lt;br /&gt;Dries quickly also.</li>
    <li> This is more of a light red than pink.  It also gave me explosive diarrhea once it dried.  Yes, I put it on my fingernails and no I can&#x27;t explain it....  Maybe it&#x27;s not meant to be drank?  But really, color club has great polish.</li>
    <li> THIS is the very best of the hologram polish colors they offer! People notice it even from a distance when I wear this particular shade!</li>
    <li> This polish is beautiful and goes on very smoothly and coverage is awesome. I expected it to be almost see through but it is not! I wish I had all the colors in this polish.</li>
    <li> O M GOSH... I wish you could see this, The big color picture of the pink color is an accurate representation of it, on my screen. Except it morphs into different shades of pink as you move your hand around. I get mesmerized watching my thumb move around. It&#x27;s a great spring color. I really love it, and it&#x27;s not crazy out there, so you can wear it anywhere.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had a weakness for holos, and the color club line has some of the best I&#x27;ve ever worn. The base colors are beautiful, and the fire in the holo is stunning. It looks great under artificial lights, and in the sun it just explodes in rainbows of color. The polish is an easy two coater (maybe one, if it&#x27;s thick) and wears well.</li>
    <li> I had my doubts about this color, but it does shine holographically in the right light. A pale creamy pink, which can be paired with a glitter gloss on top for an extra look. No need to do multiple coats, covers pretty well on the first one. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I picked out a couple of shades to try.  This polish goes on smoothly.  I was able to get away with just one coat of beyond.  The rainbows are slightly visible in regular room lighting, but get in the sunlight and WOW!  I find myself just staring at my nails.  I will be purchasing more shades.</li>
    <li> buy this polish, you won&#x27;t regret it, beautiful prismatic color like a butterfly wing</li>
    <li> Very pretty - Love the way it looks - but it chips easily....  Sorry...</li>
    <li> Love the color. Chips easily. Typical with this brand.</li>
    <li> I love this holographic nail polish-it is so pretty. When I wear it I want to be outside so I can really see the holograph. Inside it is still pretty. I did a watermarble with black and it looked soooo cool. It goes on nicely. Looking forward to having more in my collection.</li>
    <li> I really like this color and the fact that it is a &amp;#34;vegan&amp;#34; polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately it will not stay on my nails.  I have tried everything from a new base coat and top coat to roughing the nail before using the polish.  It starts peeling off the nail the same day:(</li>
    <li> You only need two coats of this polish to get the BEAUTIFUL holographic effect. I want more colors of this polish!    I have photos on my blog: [...]</li>
    <li> I have looked for this color for along time. I bought 5 bottles I was so pleased. Thanks to all employees at amazon you guys are the greatest. If I had workers like you I would be in buisness 1,000 years. I hope your day is as special as you all are.</li>
    <li> The shade and holographic makes this an awesome nail polish.  The holo is so beautifully strong. I&#x27;ve received many compliments.</li>
    <li> amazing!!! looks like you have foil on your nails.</li>
    <li> Miss Bliss is a very pretty color, but when swatched alongside the others, it doesn&#x27;t have nearly the holo-ey goodness as some of the others. Specifically, Harp On It or Over The Moon.</li>
    <li> Its holographic and changes colors in different lighting I have one in every color!!! This is by far the prettiest nail polish I have seen!!</li>
    <li> There is 2 that I didn&#x27;t like,chunky holo bluebell and chunky holo black..LOVED THE OTHERS...</li>
    <li> So pretty, I have to hide it from granddaughters or it goes home with them.  Actually I now know what little gift items I can keep on hand for them for a special day or even the for the average day.  I like having a little something on hand to reward them for their good behavior and as a reminder of good times with grandma.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping ,great seller. Color is great, really holographic effect, stays really good on my nail. Polish doesn&#x27;t  chip!.</li>
