      <li>Smells good and does the job.</li>
      <li>The good news is that it does work</li>
      <li>/&gt;In summary, I believe this to be a good brand and a good product, but the off-putting scent of the sunscreen kept it from getting a 5-star rating.en kept it from getting a 5-star rating.</li>
      <li>Had to rub in really good to feel like we were covered.  </li>
      <li>and she loved it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was very happy with this product, seemed to go on easy and has a nice scent.</li>
      <li>She was very pleased and it didn&#x27;t bother her skin at all.  </li>
      <li>I have found that the sun screen qualities of Banana Boat seem to be as good or better than any sun screen I&#x27;ve used, so will make good use of the convenient spray.</li>
      <li>Love the mist and the smell!</li>
      <li>It will be perfect for anyone who wants to head to the beach or just hang out in the sun!  </li>
      <li>Nice to have in the spray can.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cooling when you apply- nice sensation.</li>
      <li>: I really liked the non-greasy formulation of this product.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel oily at all which is nice.</li>
      <li>Nice cap that locks in the off position to avoid leakage in ones luggage</li>
      <li>It is a nice size.</li>
      <li>aerosol spray sunscreen is cooling when you spray it, so that is a nice side benefit to the sun protection it contains, which is SPF 30.</li>
      <li>This is not the kind of mace used by law enforcement.</li>
      <li>The smell is nice as well.</li>
      <li>I liked that I didn&#x27;t feel greasy after applying.  </li>
      <li>that the off-brands provide (and is highly effective)</li>
      <li>Ideal for really hot days.</li>
      <li>Coverage is good, easy to apply and gives needed protection for me.</li>
      <li>Is easy to use and smells good.</li>
      <li>best price was on amazon and that&#x27;s good enough for me , priced it in the store</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and it does a good job of evenly covering the area you are spraying.  </li>
      <li>Why after I paid  $7.00 to keep my fair skin pain free, and applied  you 3 times, am I now a crispy critter?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a good product that is possibly better for women because of the scent although admittedly the scent is not that strong.</li>
      <li>I have very fair, light skin and tend to burn super easily.</li>
      <li>It gave good coverage and everyone liked the cooling effect on a hot day.</li>
      <li>I suppose it is better than water-babies spray Lotion (which requires rubbing in).</li>
      <li>It does indeed go on with a cooling, refreshing feel although the scent may be bothersome to you if you are allergic to scents.</li>
      <li>Most spray sunscreens contain alcohol.  </li>
      <li>or I&#x27;m sticky from reapplying 4 times to make sure I have some.</li>
      <li>This was my favorite bottle.  </li>
      <li>The CVS house brand I used that made me fall in love with spray sunscreens</li>
      <li>Also, spray sunscreens allow more chemicals to enter the lungs...</li>
      <li>The problem is that you can&#x27;t see where it isn&#x27;t --  I haven&#x27;t been able to get fully coverage.  </li>
      <li>It is a brand I trust that has been on many a vacation with me and always kept me</li>
      <li>Most sunscreen are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not my favorite sunscreen.</li>
      <li>Spraying is the most convenient way to get sunscreen on kids too.  </li>
      <li>Okay, so here is the deal.</li>
      <li>He sprayed a lot more of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The can produces a nice, light spray and when I rub it into my skin, it doesn&#x27;t feel oily.</li>
      <li>But its better than nothing.</li>
      <li>Like most people, we&#x27;ve used all kinds of suncreeens.</li>
      <li>Love this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The \\&quot;continuous spray\\&quot; probably won&#x27;t be sufficient sunscreen for most people.</li>
      <li>but I like coppertone, Walgreens, equate, and even bull-frog brand spray better.  </li>
      <li>I love Banana Boat products.</li>
      <li>This sunscreen did an excellent job of protecting my skin with only one application.</li>
      <li>I knew I&#x27;d be sitting on the beach, most of the time in the sun, but trying not to burn, since I take medication which advises against prolonged sun exposure.  </li>
      <li>I normally love spray sunscreen because I have 5 kids</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure it will again pass with flying colors---but until then........</li>
      <li>Great for the whole family.</li>
      <li>I need to be able to apply it evenly and on my own;&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
      <li>Nah, but it is so convenient and easy to apply, and feels great on the skin when you are boiling hot...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is not the kind of mace used by law enforcement. You really have to get someone square in the eyes if you have any chance of stopping them. But its better than nothing.</li>
    <li> Who know the Banana Boat&#x27;s product, knows that is a excellent SPF. And protect for real!! I tried at the Caribbean Ocean!!!</li>
    <li> This product is terrible. I have used spray sunscreen since it hit the market and purchased this today on my way to the beach. I am now a patchwork of sunburn and white spots! As other reviewers have said, this product needs to be rubbed in/around, which completely defeats the purpose of spray sunscreen. I highly recommend Aveeno, which I have never had a problem with.</li>
    <li> Went to a red sox ballgame and I covered myself with this stuff. In fact put it on several times throughout a four hour ballgame and it was like I was wearing no protection at all. This stuff is crap or the lot I got was bad. Won&#x27;t risk buying this brand again.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Sprays evenly and is a lot less of a hassle to use on kids. Its at the school, so can&#x27;t really say how long its lasting but it does work well.</li>
    <li> I am not really big either way.  The stream is small, and it is not the best.  NOt the worst either</li>
    <li> I took this on vacation.  I knew I&#x27;d be sitting on the beach, most of the time in the sun, but trying not to burn, since I take medication which advises against prolonged sun exposure.  I found this product to be convenient to apply and very effective.  I have a slight tan, but no burn, no bad results of 2 full days on the sunny beach.  This spray was also used on 3 and 4 year olds who played in the sand all day with the same results.  I&#x27;m sold on this product.</li>
    <li> How can it be hard to use? They add a chemical, or water, that cools you by evaporating as you spray. But if you are too close, it gets sticky, and if you are too far, you get nothing, which is dangerous right? I use spray sun block all the time and this version is a pain and I either feel I have none or I&#x27;m sticky from reapplying 4 times to make sure I have some.</li>
    <li> Not my favorite sunscreen. I am in the sun a ton and have tried every sunscreen out there. It works obviously, but it is hard to tell if it is being applied. You can&#x27;t feel it when you are spraying yourself.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ll definitely want a cream for facial application as this would choke you, but it&#x27;s nice and quick for the rest of your body.</li>
    <li> This worked great for me while in the Dominican republic. would last a good hour or so and would reply. Didnt get burnt at all.</li>
    <li> Can runs out pretty quickly and I&#x27;m never sure that my children actually have enough on.  I used the entire can after only a few beach trips with 2 kids.  I will contribute that to some getting sprayed in the wind because of the spraying mechanism.  I live on the beach and normally I only have to buy one bottle of sunscreen a year, if that.  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend for that reason.</li>
    <li> My toddler twins both have sensitive skin, and sunscreen in particular, even the supposedly gentle brands, would cause a head to toe scaly rash. This brand does not. Don&#x27;t know why, but after trying just about all of the major organic brands, we settled on Banana Boat.</li>
    <li> Does the job, spray is cool to the touch</li>
    <li> I got this for free from Crowdtap and it works really well my kids did not burn when they went swimming.</li>
    <li> I purchased the for field day at our school and it was great to keep kids fom getting burnt with out having to rub them own with lotion! Lasted ll day plus majority of the summer and we live on a lke and we are outside all the time!</li>
    <li> We all had stripes of sunburn, the spray pattern is about a 2 inch width.  Your options are either to spend 30 minutes cross hatch patterning your sunscreen application, or to have stripes of sunburn where it misses applying.  I normally love spray sunscreen because I have 5 kids and it takes forever to do lotion, but this is a TERRIBLE PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my daughter.  She was very pleased and it didn&#x27;t bother her skin at all.  The value was very good.  It was more expensive in my area.  I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> The sunscreen worked great, but the bottle didn&#x27;t last as long as I wanted.  I was in Mexico for a long weekend, and I needed to borrow more from a friend part way through the trip.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen  is wonderful.  Not sticky at all. One bottle lasted almost the whole week and applied twice a day. Smelled good too.</li>
    <li> The spray nozzle produces a narrow cone, making it impossible to hold the can far enough away to effectively spray to get sufficient coverage.</li>
    <li> The worst sunscreen I have ever used. Two of us covered ourselves in this repeatedly during the day and were in agony with sunburn that night. We were in the sun less than when we wore another product (Nivea) which was much better and kept us protected. Generally I think Banana Boat is great, but this was just rubbish.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m burned as red as a cooked lobster. I reapplied this spray 3 times during the day. Unbelievable. How can this product be called \\&quot;sunscreen?\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I bought this a year ago and did not leave a review until now.&lt;br /&gt;I am pretty sure that it made my skin darker. My skin is tan genetically and I like the way my skin color is and do not like to darken it anymore. So I stopped using it.&lt;br /&gt;For people who wants a darker shade,maybe you can try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is oily! Most sunscreen are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS： I thought a spray would be easier to apply than a suncreen lotion, but I was wrong! For your face, you cannot just spray it on your face, you have to spray it on your hands and put it on your face. And it adds extra alcohol in sprays. You dont want to put alcohol on your face, do you?</li>
    <li> Bought this because I exercise outdoors during the day, and wear contact lenses and need an extremely sweatproof product.  I&#x27;m still looking because this stuff is not the answer.  Guaranteed not to run into eyes as long as you don&#x27;t go anywhere near your face with it.  Also the mist seems like a wasteful gimmick.  I can&#x27;t help but think that a lot of the mist ends up on my floor and in my hair.  The problem is that you can&#x27;t see where it isn&#x27;t --  I haven&#x27;t been able to get fully coverage.  I&#x27;ll keep looking</li>
    <li> Overall, Banana Boat Sport Cool Zone Sunscreen Continuous Spray works rather well to block the sun&#x27;s rays. It does indeed go on with a cooling, refreshing feel although the scent may be bothersome to you if you are allergic to scents. (Try looking for something hypoallergenic if you are allergic to scents or if you simply want a product without a scent.) For me, the scent, while certainly not *too* strong, is just OK because it smells a little bit like a lady&#x27;s perfume; so I didn&#x27;t really like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I tried this a few times, I found out that while this protected me from the sun&#x27;s rays, it does need to be rubbed on in spots because it never gets fully everywhere I want it for example on parts of my face like my cheeks and the back of my neck. The \\&quot;continuous spray\\&quot; probably won&#x27;t be sufficient sunscreen for most people. I don&#x27;t like it on my hair, obviously; and don&#x27;t even try to spray this on your face, spray it on your hands and gently apply it to your face skipping the areas immediately around your eyes, nostrils and mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reviewer notes that the twisting cap prevents any spray from leaking out--and I agree! Good point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a good product that is possibly better for women because of the scent although admittedly the scent is not that strong. This also works well as a supplement to other similar sunblock products by Banana Boat including Banana Boat Sport Performance Sunscreen Lotion SPF 50.</li>
    <li> Love the mist and the smell!</li>
    <li> Much cheaper online than in the store.  I bought several to take on a two week vacation.  One bottle will last several days for two people included multiple re-application.</li>
    <li> I have used many different spray sunscreen brands(neutrogena, coppertone, target&#x27;s brand) and this one was my least favorite. The spray was very narrow and difficult to cover all of my child&#x27;s skin without having to rub it around with my hands. the spray was not generous, but rather thin and airy. i felt as though i had to go over the same area over and over to make sure the skin was protected. I would not buy this or recommend to others</li>
    <li> This has a great spray nozzle, other brands tend to leak or get all over your hands. This also works well and for a long time.</li>
    <li> I used this repeatedly throughout a day on the beach and am, days later, still incredibly red. Will not recommend to anyone. Will likely not be purchasing a spray sunscreen again, either.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and works well. Doesn&#x27;t run into your eyes. Only issue is the price because you can easily go through a can a day.</li>
    <li> Son got a sunburn patchy one at that after using this, also my kids get contact dermatitis two days up to a week after, rashes that turn to boils that can get easily infected after using this product. Why are the ingredients not listed?!</li>
    <li> Have no complaints about this sunscreen. Is easy to use and smells good. That&#x27;s half the battle as makes you want to use it. I assume it&#x27;s doing its job. Sunscreen is a must if you are outdoors with the vanishing ozone. I prefer using a spray to a lotion so this is a no brainer. Reasonably priced too.</li>
    <li> Why does a product called &amp;#34;Banana Boat&amp;#34; not smell like, well, bananas? Or at least something tropical? Or how about nothing at all? Instead it smells like nasty cheap perfume. Three stars because it works really well; I&#x27;ve been cycling a lot and I&#x27;m still pale as an albino in Siberia.</li>
    <li> Okay, so here is the deal. I don&#x27;t burn. My sons don&#x27;t burn. Thank you Portuguese genes! However I am afraid of skin cancer. So I put this on myself and my kids. My husband this year was like &amp;#34;Sprays don&#x27;t work. The wind blows them around and you can&#x27;t get complete coverage.&amp;#34; And all I could think that it would be WAY EASIER to apply to our very active toddler, who unfortunately has his skin and not mine. He was so set in his idea that he was right and I was wrong that he challenged me to spray him with it before going out for a BBQ. SO I did. And guess what....he didn&#x27;t burn. TAKE THAT! I am a little paranoid for my toddler though, because what if it was a fluke? I don&#x27;t know, but I think for adults, this stuff works fine. Obviously. I win.</li>
    <li> I had a bad allergic reaction to this product after applying this to my face. My face got very red and irritated and then my skin reacted like I was burned..peeling badly over a few days. Don&#x27;t put this on your face, especially if your skin is sensitive.</li>
    <li> Stuff sprays well, and seems to protect well.  I like it!</li>
    <li> I think you need to apply the entire bottle to get enough sunscreen out of it. Do NOT rub, as you will rub it off, not in. I got fried as well as 2 friends who used it. Worst sunscreen ever!!</li>
    <li> Spray-on sunscreen is so convenient and easy to use. My kids don&#x27;t fuss about having to put sunscreen when spraying is an option. It&#x27;s not nearly as sticky and messy as the rub-on kind. Goes on light and dry and offers great protection from the sun.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got three basic requirements for sunscreen:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It needs to work;&lt;br /&gt;2) I need to be able to apply it evenly and on my own;&lt;br /&gt;3) I don&#x27;t want to pay $20 a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Banana Boat makes good stuff and the spray applicator is even, meaning that the spray is something I can control without a mess. The price point is good, too -- a blend of value and quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We bought 3 cans this summer. Why experiment with another brand when Banana Boat is solid for a fair price?</li>
    <li> Best spray sunscreen I&#x27;ve tried. It&#x27;s cooling when you apply- nice sensation. It&#x27;s also non-sticky and actually dries quickly. I&#x27;ve already recommended it I like it so much. Ideal for really hot days.</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen and it does have a cooling effect when applied. My kids thought that was pretty neat. Covers well and dries fast. Holds up being in water, too.</li>
    <li> Love it, its cool as described and it sprays well to reach my back...goes on evenly.</li>
    <li> It does seem to prevent sunburn, but it is cold when sprayed.  Not sure why, but I like coppertone, Walgreens, equate, and even bull-frog brand spray better.  I suppose it is better than water-babies spray Lotion (which requires rubbing in).</li>
    <li> On the surface, this sunscreen works just like all of the other spray sunscreens.  It&#x27;s easy to apply and it does a good job of evenly covering the area you are spraying.  The difference with the Sport Performance Cooling is that the spray actually feels cold.  Now, I know - you&#x27;re thinking why the heck is that important.  Dude, when it is 100 degrees outside and you&#x27;re spending the day at the beach, the pool, an amusement park or just outside in the summer -  this stuff feels ah-maz-ing.  If you&#x27;re going to buy sunscreen anyway - why not get the added benefit of something that can instantly cool your skin on the hottest of days?  You can thank me later.</li>
    <li> good product but not enough volume.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen has a great cooling feeling when applied. It is a nice size. It smells pretty good too. It is the typical sunscreen smell but I enjoy it. I would definitely repurchase! Just an overall great sunscreen.</li>
    <li> This is our spare can for the car. Works as well as any other general sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I really like it. Very confortable.&lt;br /&gt;All my friends want it...</li>
    <li> First: My brother got SECOND DEGREE SUNBURN when using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My grandmother bought this for my brother, some friends, and I for a waterpark. I have very tan skin that rarely gets sunburnt, usually I get minimal peeling if I am out for a long time in the sun and my brother (who has fair skin) gets red and peels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While my brother and I used this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Me: I got the worst sunburn of my life. My skin was red, itchy, and peeling like crazy. I have never had a sunburn that bad!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My brother: He got SECOND DEGREE SUNBURN! He was not only red and peeling, he had BLISTERS from the sun/sunburn!&lt;br /&gt;*Note He sprayed a lot more of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope that it was just our bottle, but it baked us!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never had a problem with the brand before, but this product did the opposite of it&#x27;s purpose. I&#x27;ll just buy a different product from their brand next time.</li>
    <li> Pleasant scent and ease of application are just two of the positive qualities of this product.  It also is an effective sunscreen and is available for a reasonable fun.  If you prefer the spray on sunscreens, this one is strong choice. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> yes,this is a gift for my friend</li>
    <li> Banana boat, you lied to me! You said if I bought, that you would UVA/UVB protect me. Why after I paid  $7.00 to keep my fair skin pain free, and applied  you 3 times, am I now a crispy critter?&lt;br /&gt;I bought this  product for 1 reason. to protect my skin and my childs skin from sunburn. We both are burned and in pain. It doesn&#x27;t matter  about the convenience of a spray or the cooling effect or even the nongreasy, nonsmelly wonderfullness if it doesnt protect you from the sun. I will never  use  this product ever again. I love my pale skin and hate sunburn and not to mention the  risk of skin cancer. To me if a product doesn&#x27;t do what it says it&#x27;s supposed to do  then, I  is false advertising.</li>
    <li> Makes it easy to apply to ones back by yourself. Nice cap that locks in the off position to avoid leakage in ones luggage</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a Banana Boat fan and user for several years. I gave this product a try as an experiment because I was getting tired of having to lotion up with the cream for the summer. Safe to say that was a bad idea. This did not make my skin feel good at all. It felt rough and dry. And I didn&#x27;t feel my skin was adequately protected when I went out in the sun. I usually look at the ingredients before buying a product but in this case, I was so desperate to try something new I didn&#x27;t do that. Won&#x27;t be using this again.</li>
    <li> Nice to have in the spray can.  That way I may actually use it!</li>
    <li> Best smelling sun screen around and it does feel cool when applied!</li>
    <li> I mean, it&#x27;s sunscreen. And it&#x27;s probably destroying the ozone, but it had free shipping, and cvs is 10 minutes away.</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen for the price, though you need to be thorough since the stream of the spray is very narrow. I somewhat resembled a zebra after doing a 3 hour river float with this on.</li>
    <li> I like spray better than rub on and didn&#x27;t burn this summer, so I would say this works pretty well. I like the contoured bottle as it fits the hand well. Other than that, what can anyone say? Since I got it towards the end of summer, I haven&#x27;t used it quite enough to determine whether the nozzle gets clogged and it becomes unusable before you are done. Maybe I can amend this review next summer.</li>
    <li> We tried the sunscreen during one of the extremely hot days this summer. It was close to 100 degrees when we used it. The good news is that it does work and we didn&#x27;t get burned. But I still prefer just regular sunscreen instead of spraying it. Sometimes it seems like the spray comes out isn&#x27;t getting to every part of our body or else it just took a lot more spray to get the full coverage that is needed. It is a nice cool mist that you&#x27;ll get from the spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We also did use this on our 6-month-old at the time since we didn&#x27;t have anything else and while it did protect her from the sun, she didn&#x27;t seem to really care for the feel of the sunscreen. She reacts better to regular sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I did like the idea of a sunscreen that sprays but the spraying action still does need some work. Once the spray effect is made better, then this is the perfect solution to not having to rub in sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Throughout the summer we probably go through at least 15 bottles of sunscreen in our household.  This was my favorite bottle.  It smelled like cucumber mellon.  I loved the cooling sensation.  It provided smooth and even coverage.  I liked that I didn&#x27;t feel greasy after applying.  Super easy to reapply after going in the water.  Making this part of my beach bag from now on.</li>
    <li> Love this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took this on a family vacation this summer, and encouraged everyone there to help test it for me. With a big Puerto Rican family and assorted married-in relatives, we had almost every skin type in the book covered (pun intended). From blue-ivory to deep brown, no one burned. One pale-skinned \\&quot;test subject\\&quot; did note that she sprayed it on, then got in the pool, and her swimsuit top shifted position enough to expose skin she hadn&#x27;t treated; she ended up with symmetrical bright red sunburns outlining the difference between protected and unprotected skin. Even she didn&#x27;t burn where she&#x27;d sprayed the sunscreen, though. The kids liked it because it went on fast and easy, so they didn&#x27;t have to stay still for long. Even when they jumped in the pool faster than I thought prudent--I thought it should have time to dry fully--they still didn&#x27;t burn. We did spray it on hands to wipe on faces, to avoid spraying too close to eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this will definitely be a staple part of our outdoor plans from now on!</li>
    <li> I thought I&#x27;d already reviewed this product, so forgive me if this repeats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried the other BB spray on sunscreen, the lotiony kind and been frustrated with how spottily it goes on compared to the clear (and more pricey) Nutrogena equivalent. The ONLY point of spray on sunscreen is to distribute the substance widely over hard-to-reach areas. Otherwise you&#x27;d just rub in lotion by hand. So the lotiony BB spray was ultimately pointless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sport Cool Zone approximates the Nutrogena spray-on: Clear, fine, goes on evenly. You can spray it on your back, rub the back of your arm around the area, and be pretty confident you&#x27;ve got coverage.</li>
    <li> A little runny, but does the job.</li>
    <li> A few of us used this product at the beach and ended up with streaks of sunburn. When applying, everywhere was shinny, as if there was sunscreen on it, but afterwards there were definitely spots missed. The cooling effect was neat, but it would have been better if the sunscreen part actually worked.</li>
    <li> We bought this sunscreen as we had heard it was great for active people. First off, it smells horrible! Second, it is NOT rub free as advertised (false advertisement?). The worst part was that we were only outside for just over 2 hours and for the look of our burns we began to burn immediately after heading outdoors. I would like to add that we followed the apply 15 minutes before heading out rule even! My husband and I are both red as a lobster. 9 hours after being in the sun and we are already blistering up. Aloe, witch hazel, cool showers, ice packs wrapped in a small towel...no relief? If I had the $200 for an ER visit I would have been there a few hours ago. As it goes now I&#x27;ll be in the dr. office in the morning. I&#x27;m dizzy and nauseous from the burn that using this sunscreen has caused! Please think twice before using this product!</li>
    <li> This is a great sunscreen and so convenient. It is pricey compared to the typical tube of goop. But I love the convenience of this kind of sunscreen to reapplication after the initial goop application in the morning! So simple and on a super hot day on the beach still feels cool. I had no burns, and spent a lot of time on the Atlantic beaches this July (record heat!). So it certainly works.. My first choice? Nah, but it is so convenient and easy to apply, and feels great on the skin when you are boiling hot... Great product!</li>
    <li> I saved this product until I could give it a true test, so this review is a result of a test run during a very sunny long weekend at the shore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: I really liked the non-greasy formulation of this product. I tend to break out from traditional lotions, so I appreciated another option. Initially, I also liked that it went on clear. The marketing literature for Banana Boat Sport Cool Zone Sunscreen Continuous Spray SPF 30 states that it \\&quot;instantly cools and refreshes skin.\\&quot; It lives up to the cooling side of that promise in spades, so much so that I got goosebumps while applying it in the morning in my chilly air conditioned hotel room. The can is sizable and will last many applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: Unfortunately, one of the aspects of this that I liked eventually turned out to be its downfall. Because this sunscreen goes on invisible and dries almost instantaneously, it&#x27;s almost impossible to tell what parts of the skin it&#x27;s covered and what ones it hasn&#x27;t. As a result, I experienced a few burn spots. As other reviewers have pointed out, despite the manufacturer claiming this product is rub-free, the instructions state to rub in, and I believe you need to do so to get proper coverage. Just make sure you do so quickly because the mist is gone within seconds.</li>
    <li> I hate having to apply the usual cream stuff, so this makes everything a breeze.  The locking cap works with just a simple click left or right.  Of course for the convenience it&#x27;s pricier than the cream stuff.  My bald head burns pretty easy if out in the hot sun, but I have not had any problems when applying this stuff.  Not only would I buy again, I already have.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen does protect you from harmful UV rays. Sprays on clear and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue. It does however make your skin feel slightly dry almost sticky in a way after you are coated. It&#x27;s kind of weird for me to describe. Its not super unpleasant just odd. I guess it&#x27;s less noticeable and easier to apply than normal sunscreen. The feeling on the skin is just different. The smell is nice as well. Keeps you protected.</li>
    <li> This product is subject to a recall due to fire hazard.  There are reported cases where people have caught fire after applying the product and then being in close proximity of open fire or a BBQ before the volatile content had evaporated from the skin.  Secondly the product was close to its sell by date.</li>
    <li> I got this for around $3 and it was a great deal and the product works great. No complaints at all.</li>
    <li> I have very fair, light skin and tend to burn super easily. This sunscreen did an excellent job of protecting my skin with only one application. Was outdoors in bright sunlight at a festival for several hours, and my skin was only slightly tan, no redness or burning at all, even on my ears and nose. I worried that some of it got rubbed off, and had forgotten it in the car, but even with just that one application it did fine. Will definitely use and purchase again!</li>
    <li> It sprays like it should, keeps away the sunburn like it should. They could drop the cool zone as far as I am concerned, I didn&#x27;t care for the feel of it. I will therefore not buy this specific product again.</li>
    <li> The fragrant of this sunscreen is a little strong.</li>
    <li> As far as sunscreen goes it&#x27;s fine, I don&#x27;t like that it&#x27;s got a perfum-y scent to it.</li>
    <li> We used this over the summer before heading out to the pool or going for a run.  It was easy to use, dried quickly and pretty much did the job.  The formula dried out my skin, but this is probably due to the aerosol format.</li>
    <li> I bought a bunch of these to take to the beach and regretted it! They sprayed so unevenly that I had to rub in after and still ended up burning. Switched to a diff brand (Hawaiian Tropic) of spray, which really reinforced how bad this one was.</li>
    <li> Used this product at the beach and the kids loved it. It gave good coverage and everyone liked the cooling effect on a hot day. It seemed to be water resistant, but we did reapply after playing extensively in the water. For best results you may wish to spray it on and then use your hand to evenly spread around preventing any thinly sprayed areas from sunburning. Do note the flammable precaution so don&#x27;t spray around the bbq or other open flame. Good overall product!</li>
    <li> Stuff is great if you are lazy, put on in a well ventilated area otherwise its hard to breath if you take a whiff of this.</li>
    <li> I am fair-skinned and extra sun sensitive due to prescription medication I take, so it is important that I be careful about sun protection. Five years ago, I moved to a small beach town so, since I am outside and at the beach more often now, sun protection has become even more important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This aerosol spray sunscreen is cooling when you spray it, so that is a nice side benefit to the sun protection it contains, which is SPF 30. The can produces a nice, light spray and when I rub it into my skin, it doesn&#x27;t feel oily. It was super windy at the beach today and, even when the sand blew against my legs, the sand did not stick to my legs. I have severely dry skin, though, so it could be that my skin absorbs it more completely than oilier skin would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that the spray feature can be disabled (for transportation or storage) by turning the top of the can two clicks. Two clicks back, and it&#x27;s ready to spray. This is helpful as I use a backpack as my beach bag and there will often be things piled on top of the sunscreen can on the way to or from the beach that could cause a mess inside my bag if it didn&#x27;t have this feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am quite fragrance sensitive, so I notice the fragrance of products more than most people. I found the fragrance of this spray unpleasant--it reminds me of bug spray. THANKFULLY, once it absorbs into my skin, I don&#x27;t notice it much, if at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The protection the sunscreen provides is good. I am out in the sun enough that I still tan, but I tan slowly and I do not burn. Many people may not need an SPF as high as 30, but for those of us who are sun sensitive, it is a Godsend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a long-time user of Banana Boat sunscreens, though this is the first aerosol spray I believe I&#x27;ve used of theirs. It is a brand I trust that has been on many a vacation with me and always kept me protected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, I believe this to be a good brand and a good product, but the off-putting scent of the sunscreen kept it from getting a 5-star rating.en kept it from getting a 5-star rating.</li>
    <li> Banana Boat Sport Cool Zone Sunscreen Continuous Spray SPF 30 was my first experience with using a spray sunscreen. I only applied the product below the neck because I don&#x27;t use many products on my face. You can apply the spray faster and it is less messy than using lotion which is a plus for me. I never had any problems with the product and enjoyed using it so much, that I convinced my mom to try it as well and she loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend Banana Boat Sport Cool Zone Sunscreen Continuous Spray SPF 30 for people who are active. I was able to use the spray and sweat a ridiculous amount and the product stayed on.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, not greasy and hope I&#x27;m protected.</li>
    <li> Everyone knows that sunscreen not only helps prevent sunburn, but also protects you from harmful rays. And while I admit I don&#x27;t always remember to apply sunscreen when I plan to be outdoors, I do remember to bring it along when I go to the beach or pool for a swim. Banana Boat&#x27;s spray provides ample protection for me - as I have avoided burns for quite some time. The cooling spray, which tingles when applied, is fairly easy to use. Unlock the cap (it twists to prevent accidental discharge), point and push. The mist covers your body quickly without any stickiness, residue, or mess. There is no/little scent worth mentioning, so no worries about smelling like a 1980&#x27;s tanning booth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I&#x27;ve run into, which is fairly minor, and likely easy to correct, is that in even minor winds, the spray dissipates quickly instead of applying to your body. I&#x27;ve overcome this by applying the spray behind my car door or down wind, ensuring the spray makes contact with my body. Additionally, because the mist is so gentle/light, I sometimes reapply as I&#x27;m not sure that it has covered the entire surface. I know that sunscreen lotions also fail to cover your entire body evenly, as you rub them in, but at least with those, you know you&#x27;ve at least tried. With a spray like this, you can only hope that you covered your entire exposed surfaces. While a minor complaint about this type of product, it is worth noting, especially if you live in an area with high winds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m a big fan of the spray. No overpowering scent; no mess; no fuss; and a cooling effect when applied, which I can only imagine is very helpful if you apply it a bit after you&#x27;ve been exposed to the sun and realize you forgot to do it earlier.</li>
    <li> The attraction of spray-on sunscreen is huge: you don&#x27;t have to get your palms filthy smearing around a cream, it&#x27;s less greasy / sticky, and the rapid coverage from a moderate distance lets you apply and reapply easily and quickly by yourself (especially the hard-to-reach areas on the back!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, this product fails to live up to any of those promises, and therefore is at best an expensive novelty and at worst inadequate sun protection when you need it most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the one good thing about the sunscreen: when you spray it on heavily and then rub it in, it provides effective sun protection.  Wait a second, doesn&#x27;t that sound a lot like using a sunscreen cream, and totally defeats the purpose of spending 2x the $ for half the quantity for the convenience of a spray?  Yes, yes it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the bad: it&#x27;s almost impossible to spray enough of this sunscreen on in a uniform layer.  It may have something to do with whatever propellant Banana Boat uses to make this a \\&quot;cooling\\&quot; spray, but rather than the heavy self-propelled \\&quot;sheet\\&quot; of sunscreen fluid that the off-brands provide (and is highly effective), this product creates a sunscreen \\&quot;fog.\\&quot;  Very little of said fog ends up on your skin, and really only does so in patches.  Which means you have to go ahead and rub that stuff around to get good protection.  Again, completely defeats the proposed convenience of this product, and means the incremental expense over a bottle of sunscreen lotion is wasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do no buy.  The CVS house brand I used that made me fall in love with spray sunscreens is far, far superior stuff, so I would point you there.</li>
    <li> Both of my cans of this stuff lasted about 2/3 the way thru then started spitting and had to be shaken vigorously to get anything out of them.&lt;br /&gt;No  buying them again. The ones at target are cheaper and don&#x27;t spit.</li>
    <li> THis is really a great product. Had a lot of exposure this last Labor Day weekend and no burning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for getting the kids coated and protected.  Adults, too.</li>
    <li> Purchased for a cruise.  It was Perfect!  Had purchased several and only needed part of first one.  Great buy for anyone!</li>
    <li> If you have kiddos, you know what a challenge it can be to get sunscreen on them. My son absolutely refuses to let me lather him up with sunscreen lotion, but he thinks this spray sunscreen is pretty cool. It sprays easily and dries quickly (I do go ahead and rub it in a little bit to make sure all the skin is covered - I don&#x27;t want to worry about accidentally missing a patch of skin). It doesn&#x27;t feel oily at all which is nice. Great for the whole family.</li>
    <li> If it would spray evenly every time it would be great, but it doesn&#x27;t. More often than not the stream is a direct stream that you then have to spread out with your hands. Given that I&#x27;ll stick to regular sun lotion.</li>
    <li> Purchased this product after seeing the number of positive reviews.  Used on a vacation in Central America with sun exposure of approx. 2 hours with sunscreen applied. Please be warned, this sunscreen did not work at all.  When applied, I covered every inch with the spray and rubbed in (although difficult to rub in) and received sunburn after only 2 hours in the sun.  I even waited the full 15min after applying the sunscreen indoors. I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Worked well and easily covered the skin.  It did seem to waste a lot of extra sunscreen when spraying although this is with any spray sunscreen so not really a con.</li>
    <li> If you have not bought a bottle of sunscreen in a while toss the old ones and buy Banana Boat Sport Cool Zone Sunscreen. It is a spray type sunscreen. From the other reviews it looks like multiple applications might be a good idea, however  I live in the mid-west, applied a few times when out in the sun for very long, and my experience is that it goes on easy, smells ok, and prevents a sunburn. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Smells really good!  Better than the usual smell of sunblock products.  It does feel cool to the skin.  Very happy with product.</li>
    <li> It seems cool at first. They sold me on the easy to apply spray on. After my vacation in mexico I came back looking like I had leprosy. It is impossible to spread this stuff evenly. Leaves you with blotchy-looking skin. I will definitely stick to the old-fashioned lotion next time for an even sunscreen. This sunscreen ruined my life temporarily. To think I will be a bridesmaid in two weeks wearing a strapless dress! Ruined!!!</li>
    <li> I got this for a beach themed raffle basket and it tucked in nicely and looks good!  It will be perfect for anyone who wants to head to the beach or just hang out in the sun!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is a terrible product! It leaves streaks on your body and you will be left half burnt where the product &amp;#34;appeared&amp;#34; to be! I&#x27;m not sure if the spray nozzle is too narrow or what but I am now not able to leave the hotel due to the burns on my body from this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An excellent producti if you want to look like someone practiced calligraphy on your skin;  solid line of protection surrounded by a deep burn.</li>
    <li> Most spray sunscreens contain alcohol.  When sprayed on any open skin (sunburn, cut, burn, injury) it will hurt.  Especially on kids!  My 5 year old son cried and screamed bc I sprayed some on his sunburn.  I felt so bad for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please read your spray sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I love Banana Boat products. They have a gentle pleasant scent, . This sport cool zone spray is the perfect sunscreen for touch ups, because it goes on light, and at 30 spf, it definitely does the job.</li>
    <li> Who doesn&#x27;t want to be outdoors on a perfect summer day? You need protection, but you don&#x27;t want to feel greasy or smell like the cosmetics department. Banana Boat has a nice, clean feel and no cloying odor. This is a spray, so it&#x27;s easy to apply, and it feels very refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our family used it this summer, and it seemed very effective. You can&#x27;t spray yourself in the face, though, so you need a separate product. The facial moisturizer I use contains sunscreen, so this wasn&#x27;t a problem for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you plan to spend the day at the beach, use this for your arms, shoulders, etc.,  and bring a small bottle of sunscreen lotion for your face. You probably won&#x27;t have to reapply the Banana Boat spray if you go for a dip in the lake, but you may want to touch up the lotion on your face after swimming.</li>
    <li> Like most people, we&#x27;ve used all kinds of suncreeens. Lotions, pump bottles, sprays. And they each have their advantages. We liked this one because it was convenient, fast and dried pretty quickly. No bottle tops to pop open, no mess on your hands. Just quick and easy. We found it to be especially helpful for the younger set that was too anxious to go play to allow us to fully lather them up with lotion. It just took too long. But we could hit them with this quickly and efficiently and send them back out to play. In terms of coverage, we had no complaints. Seemed to do what it was supposed to do. My only complaint is that it seemed to run out quickly. Then again, it was a 6-ounce bottle and a 6-ounce bottle of lotion would run out quickly too. Still, for a busy day, you may want to grab more than one.</li>
    <li> This is a convenient to use Sun Screen.  I got it to use on my 5-year old grandson who loves the outdoors; and it is quick and easy to apply so gets the job done.  I have found that the sun screen qualities of Banana Boat seem to be as good or better than any sun screen I&#x27;ve used, so will make good use of the convenient spray.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen mainly because it is a spray on! Coverage is good, easy to apply and gives needed protection for me.</li>
    <li> This works well on my 5 year old son in and out of the water. I would remember to rub it in after you spray as the bottle&#x27;s directions say.  I would use a face stick or sport stick for a child&#x27;s face.  Even spraying it in your hand and then applying to the face creates the strong odor still near the child&#x27;s face.</li>
    <li> good, but kinda expensive for what you get.</li>
    <li> Once we got to the lake we applied this to the kids, it was very easy to use on them, and quick too. We had to spray it into our hands and apply it to faces, but it worked. It did the job, but I still prefer a lotion that can be applied ahead of time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been pretty satisfied with Banana Boat products in the past, and this one is no exception.  The spray is convenient and easy to apply, though as some have already mentioned, you have to apply it to your face by hand. The scent is not unpleasant, and it&#x27;s much less messy than creams or lotions, Coverage is not a problem as long as you hit all the right spots.  My family is all fair-skinned, and it&#x27;s good for at least 1-2 hours of direct sun exposure.  Depending on how liberally you apply it, the 6-ounce can may not last at long as you would like, but overall it&#x27;s a very good product.</li>
    <li> best price was on amazon and that&#x27;s good enough for me , priced it in the store this was way cheaper we got 8 cans and saved like 30 bucks , sometimes i still feel i have to rub it in don&#x27;t know how that is but it did protect me in the mexico sun , i also the the 15 and it worked very well.</li>
    <li> the best, easy to transport and apply</li>
    <li> Very good quality! My childrens loved: Invisible, rub-free, quick drying, and non-greasy!</li>
    <li> This is very convenient to use especially is no one else is around to help you get all the exposed skin covered. Smells good and does the job.</li>
    <li> I put this on several times throughout the day and it didn&#x27;t work at all. I have a bright red, uneven sun burn. Besides looking absolutely ridiculous, I&#x27;m not confident that it provided me with any SPF protection. Never buying this again.</li>
    <li> First, the sunscreen does do the job, probably as well as any of them if you put it on every so often (yes, they are right, if you sweat a lot or are in the water a lot, the stuff rubs off).  However, I don&#x27;t really like the feel of the stuff; it is clear, and it has a kind of slimy (to me, anyway) feel; it isn&#x27;t really greasy, just not real comfortable to me.  The old white colored lotions work well, and they don&#x27;t have the icky (again, the way it feels on my skin) feeling.  I realize this is kind of a subjective rather than objective approach, and for you, it may feel fine.  Nonetheless, those are my impressions.</li>
    <li> This product seems to have kept my skin safe from high altitude sun on a mountain hike.  It also had such a strong, unpleasant odor that it kept away insects and my hiking partner too.  I did not have the opportunity to find out if it also works against bear.  I like the idea of a flavored sunscreen and found the dispenser worked fine.  It may be an OK choice for people without sensitive noses and no concern for covering themselves with strong chemicals.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d give this a higher rating if it wasn&#x27;t freezing cold when applied.  Especially unpleasant for the kids first thing in the morning before camp.  Brrr.</li>
    <li> i guess it worked, but you have to apply when there is no wind.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with this product, seemed to go on easy and has a nice scent. I got it for my boyfriend who refuses to put on sunscreen so this worked out very nicely for my sneak sunscreen attacks. I imagine if you have kids, it would work very well for that as well. My boyfriend did complain that the smell was a little too &#x27;feminine&#x27;. Either way, I was happy.</li>
    <li> This stuff feels so good when it is hot or when you already have a sunburn. Seemed to work just fine.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the current recommendations from the American Academy of Dermatology being SPF 30-50 every two hours (do it!) I keep this in every room and bag and don&#x27;t leave the house without it.</li>
    <li> Light and easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling all greasy. Getting ready for vacation.</li>
    <li> This is the easiest method to apply sunscreen with less mess than using conventional creams.  Although you do need to use your hands to smooth over the sprayed areas, there is less excess on the hands.  Spraying is the most convenient way to get sunscreen on kids too.  I wouldn&#x27;t ever go back to creams.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen contains oxybenzone, a harmful chemical absorbed by the skin that is also hormone disruptor and linked to low birth weights. I avoid it completely in sunscreens. Also, spray sunscreens allow more chemicals to enter the lungs... I use mineral sunscreens instead- yes they are thick and may be harder to apply, but safer for my body.</li>
    <li> I did not purchase this through Amazon, but I wanted to warn everyone that my daughter (19 years old) has a terrible burn despite using this product very frequently.  I applied it all throughout the day and she still burned.  She is very fair-skinned and burns easily, but as long as I constantly apply, there never seems to be a problem.  I have never used this particular sunscreen before (I&#x27;ve used Banana Boat before, but not this cooling version).  Please please be careful - especially with fair, sunburn prone skin!!  There were areas that did not get burned, but I have no idea what the difference in those areas and the ones that did get burned.  I always spray the lotion on, then rub it in.  And was very consistent!</li>
    <li> Works well and its easily applied with little mess.  Great for the kids when on the go.  Price was competitive as well without all the shopping / running around.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great to have an effective sunscreen that you can spray on.</li>
    <li> Just put in a bag, pop it out in the middle of the day to refresh and pop back in the bag.</li>
    <li> Banana Boat Products never seem to offer less than the best ...and to me this sunscreen product works well ..just as one would expect these products to do..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this 30 SPF Spray under several different situations over this last summer months--at the pool , hiking and just hanging out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have to re-apply often...it protected my skin--I received no sun burn while using it.So this I want to state for now for usage on the East Coast over the summer months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However--the true test will be when I have a chance to travel to the Carribean or Florida--which I had planned to do much earlier..only to have to change my plans at the last minute. I hope to travel in the next couple of months in which I will add more to this review as I try this product out under more vigorous heat , sun and surf !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure it will again pass with flying colors---but until then........</li>
    <li> We had good results with this sunscreen, however if you read the directions you still need to rub it in. Also, in case you have not heard this yet, one of the most important things you need to know about sunscreen is: dont use it if its out of date.</li>
    <li> Very inconsistent.  Had to rub in really good to feel like we were covered.  My son and I actually got uneven sunburn, ever though I reapplied every two hours</li>
