<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> wonderful soap, last a long time a few drops go a long ways lathers and cleans nicely and will help prevent fungus and bacteria wonderful product couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. Will buy again and buy for others.</li>
    <li> Great multipurpose soap but the smell takes some getting used to</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend who has reoccurring skin fungus problems. They look like little discolored or white/red spots on his skin. He has been using this for less than a week and it has treated his skin very well and a lot of the spots have faded. He will probably end up using this body wash for a long time due to the fungus problem being genetic (?) and reoccuring. I&#x27;d recommend this for anyone struggling with skin fungus since it has Tea Tree Oil which is an antifungal.</li>
    <li> Peppermint &amp; eucalypses still the best for fragrance and feeling fresh after your bath/shower</li>
    <li> This stuff is garbage. Just as bad on sensitive skin as any other soap I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> This is great soap! I feel like it has made a definite improvement in my skin. My skin was always very dry and I think this has given me better looking skin without the harsh cheap chemicals in everyday bodywash and soaps</li>
    <li> I make my own laundry detergent and this is what I use to do it with.  The smell is clean and refreshing.  I also make my own shampoo with this.</li>
    <li> Great for fungal outbreaks from the heat and sweating....enough said!!</li>
    <li> We love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soaps, this one especially! Wonderful for bathing the dogs and my shower as well.&lt;br /&gt;Bob</li>
    <li> The scent isn&#x27;t fantastic but this soap is the definition of squeaky clean. You can&#x27;t go wrong with any dr. Bronner</li>
    <li> Soap. Buy it, don&#x27;t buy it. I don&#x27;t care. It&#x27;s soap. Really?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve turned so many people onto this soap. I&#x27;m turning 30 next month and have super sensitive skin - this soap 100% saves my face. My younger (she&#x27;s 27) sister battles acne too. She came and visited me a number of months ago, forgot her face wash, used this, and hasn&#x27;t looked back. We swear by this now. It even helped her 5 year old daughter&#x27;s ringworm clear up in about a week without medication. My mom and two close friends also made the switch. Do yourself a favor, try out a small size for a week or two, and you&#x27;ll discover your new favorite face wash!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: it doesn&#x27;t travel well because it&#x27;s oil based and super thin. That causes leaks usually. When putting it in a travel bottle, use cling wrap over the opening and the screw on the lid on over the cling wrap.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It works well and I personally like the smell a lot. If you are not sure what tea tree oil smells like I would go smell some at a store before ordering though as it&#x27;s a very particular smell that some people really hate.</li>
    <li> Excellent product that I shower and shave with. Rinses clean and goes a long way. I am not down with saving humanity, but this simply a great soap. Girls often comment how nice it is that I use organic and champion environmentalism, they love it.</li>
    <li> I needed something to clean with that was septic safe, so I found a recipe using these and baking soda. and I also used a solution of dr bronners tea tree oil and castile soap to bath my dog in . his skin is better and he doesn&#x27;t scratch all the time now. glad I went on the wed site and found these products</li>
    <li> Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps have taken over as hand soap, dish soap, laundry soap and body wash</li>
    <li> This product is great. It clears the skin and leaves your skin clean and fresh. I will order again. Thanks.</li>
    <li> My sister ended up loving this stuff after I gave it to her! Be sure to test it on your skin if it&#x27;s sensitive because I become out in a weird rash! Which is why I&#x27;m giving it a three.</li>
    <li> i love the smell of this and a little goes a long way (like a few drops on my loofa is enough for all of me, it suds up pretty fast) so i know it will last a long time. it does not have a super menthol cooling effect like the Dr Bronners Mint Soap, which i actually like  (the Mint one makes me feel like my crotch is being submersed in candy canes, its a little much) ...anyways, the container is a decent size so make sure you will have room for it in your bathroom on a lower shelf because its also heavy. you may want to get some anti-slip adhesives, at least for my cheap apartment tub i needed it because the natural oils in this did make it a little slippery. it helps a lot with body odor, so my husband started using this too and he really likes it too</li>
    <li> Soap, not much to say. Some of the words/passages on the bottle are a bit strange,</li>
    <li> Been using this soap since 2010 when I worked at Trader Joes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the Tea Tree scent, it really cleans my body well and brightens my face up. The antiseptic properties are a plus</li>
    <li> This is great soap!  Smells good, tea tree oil is supposed to be antifungal which is good if you do combat sports.</li>
    <li> I bought this soap because I read that it&#x27;s the best at getting cooked on gunk off your pots and pans. I don&#x27;t think so. Barkeeper&#x27;s Friend has it beat for that. I also don&#x27;t like the smell of it. It smells like dandruff shampoo, which I understand is a great use for this product, but since I don&#x27;t need dandruff shampoo, I&#x27;ll probably use what&#x27;s left of this to wash the cars and then not buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Lavender Castile Soap. It&#x27;s wonderful. I use it for all my cleaning. It makes the house smell so fresh!</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Well worth the money,</li>
    <li> I personally recommend Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Liquid Soaps to everyone. They don&#x27;t disappoint. The Tea Tree soap works like magic.</li>
    <li> The best soap.around!</li>
    <li> Finally a good clean soap without all of the fillers.</li>
    <li> Love this soap.  The smell is like pine sol.  I will buy other fragrant next time.</li>
    <li> Use this soap all the time, good for your skin.  I had a dry skin, itching problem and this product cured symptom.</li>
    <li> Although product performs well the smell is just awful</li>
    <li> Good for irritated skin</li>
    <li> It is the only soap we use, has been so for a number of years now. I have extremely dry skin due to thyroid issues and my husband is a cancer survivor, initially without an immune system after a stem cell transplant. We have only used Dr. Bronners Tea Tree oil. It is pure, it leaves no itchy stuff on your skin afterwards. You can wash yourself or any other thing with it.</li>
    <li> It Works well in doing the job. The smell is soft, it came on time and good price. I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
    <li> Dr. Bronners just makes great products. The scent is intense due to the natural ingredients. Tea tree oil is so beneficial to your skin, for its ability to cleanse and purify you. The other benefit to it, is that scabies, lice and other pests hate the scent, so with regular use, you can keep those little buggers at bay!  You can use this product from head to toe. Just don&#x27;t get it in your eyes!</li>
    <li> I could not bare the smell.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about the rose fragrance.  The aroma is amazing!  No toxic, synthetic smells with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s.  Also, there is no other product that offers the pure Castille oil creamy lather!</li>
    <li> This is some of my favorite soap to use in the shower.</li>
    <li> I love this soap for so many reasons. It works great with dry skin too. You just have to get used to the smell.</li>
    <li> Great product! I dilute the heck out of this and still get a great lather. I use it as shampoo and it works great!</li>
    <li> I have been using Dr Bronners Magic Soap for over 30 years and every time I try anything else I am reminded that Bronners is the best. It is great to take camping in the back country as a little goes a long ways and does not hurt the environment like a lot of products do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good:&lt;br /&gt;*  Works on just about anything like your body, your clothes, your teeth (yes it makes a tremendous replacement for all those chemicals in toothpaste) and a lot more&lt;br /&gt;*  Cheap, a little goes a LONG ways and way cheaper than anything else per use, 32 OZ lasts us most of a year&lt;br /&gt;*  You know what is in this stuff, and it is all stuff you don&#x27;t mind putting in/on your body, no animal testing needed, human animals have been using these ingredients forever&lt;br /&gt;*  The new labels don&#x27;t come off and wash down the drain&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad:&lt;br /&gt;*  Really miss the old label with Emmanual&#x27;s holy writ, used to read that in the shower to start my day, wish it would come back</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, I am trying all flavors of Dr.Bronners soaps i started with their lavender one years ago and then their eucalyptus version and their Mint version and I love them all so far but  the Tea Tree ones is Great for me :D</li>
    <li> Bronners is Bronners. Seems silly to be buying soap off the Internet, but Bronners isn&#x27;t carried in my local stores. The free shipping helps since the price is a little higher than in a store.</li>
    <li> Super concentrated is no lye! This soap is powerful stuff and I think I could do wonders with it. The problem is what are those wonders? 18 uses and I&#x27;m being let down on just one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Countless sources say this stuff will not lather easily  in hard water, which I&#x27;m finding to be true. However, even when I used it liberally in a dilution with water, the later is very difficult to come by. The tea tree scent is not very powerful, at least not as the peppermint variant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now, this bottle is under the bathroom sink until I figure out how to maximize it.</li>
    <li> This is detergent free and an amazing soap for your body!!  However, it costs the same at the lowest possible price here, on Amazon,  when you go to your local Walgreens (haven&#x27;t checked CVS yet)...but it is a fantastic product for you, your pets...pretty much everything!!!  Sorry couldn&#x27;t find it less expensive on Amazon.  But buy it...will not let you down.</li>
    <li> I love the castile soaps.  They don&#x27;t dry out my skin like traditional soaps.  The scent is VERY strong though, so if you don&#x27;t like tea tree oil smell, this is not for you!</li>
    <li> Got this for body wash and for my hair in place of shampoo that held sulfates in it. Turned out im allergic to sulfates and sulfides.&lt;br /&gt;A LITTLE BIT GOES A LONG WAYS. DILUTE DILUTE DILUTE. especially if you are using this on skin and hair. I keep mine in a pump with a 1:8 ratio of Bronner&#x27;s and water and it lathers well. Works best if you rinse repeat, just dont leave it in your hair or skin for very long otherwise you may end up dried out.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure what it is but this cleans my hair well, but dries my scalp out and makes some flakes. Not near as bad as regular store bought shampoo with sulfates, but still more than I like.&lt;br /&gt;Been using it now for about 8 weeks. Body wash it works, love the smell, bit on the strong side though.&lt;br /&gt;Some of the dryness may be because of winter and hard water at the place I reside in, so will update it later on down the road as the weather improves.&lt;br /&gt;I expect this bottle to last me an entire year. 2 months in and I am just barely past the top of the label.</li>
    <li> The only &amp;#34;dandruff shampoo&amp;#34; that has worked for me, wish I had tried it years ago, but bought into the Head and Shoulder&#x27;s etc lie. After just two washes (and a rinse with water/apple cider vinegar) my scalp is not itchy!  Raw, red spots have gone away. My scalp feels normal and happy. Thank you Dr. Bronner&#x27;s!!</li>
    <li> I have been purchasing castille soap for years. I love this stuff. For some reason it seems to clean me better than any other product around. And you can also use it to clean your house. Its that good!</li>
    <li> The smell is not very good... I wished this product had a better smell when using it. Not sure if I can ever get past the smell enough to try it.</li>
    <li> Best soap ever..I suffered with perspiring no matter what kind of deodorant I used..I also suffered with boils for over 20 years. But since I been using tea tree I can skip a day without deodorant an I haven&#x27;t had a  boil since thank you lawd..this is some good stuff..I also use a shower gel after as well so I won&#x27;t be smelling like tea tree...cause the scent is strong but its great</li>
    <li> I LOVE Dr. Bronner&#x27;s!!  It&#x27;s excellent - I use it on myself when mosquitos bite or if I get a hold of poison ivy, and I use it on my Yorkie when she&#x27;s itchy, careful not to get it in her eyes - it kills fleas, and ticks ON CONTACT!  This is an amazing all natural product that I&#x27;ll contiinue to use for years.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my bathroom sink as a hand cleaner.  Just can&#x27;t get past the strong pine-sol like odor.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I will try it out on the floors.</li>
    <li> Good product that helped with my mite problem.</li>
    <li> This stuff is phenomenal. Worth every penny. It is a bit much for hair (really strips the oils, I assume), but lathers wonderfully as a body soap. Few soaps leave this kind of &amp;#34;obvious clean&amp;#34; feeling on body or hands. It is  very concentrated. Diluted, it has replaced all my hand soaps and bar soaps. It is a great clean soap for countertops and floors, and works really well as dish soap  - although the dedicated dish soaps (Dawn) do have better grease-dissolving properties. This is a great product, and I feel good ecologically using it. Keep the harsh chemicals out of our sewers.</li>
    <li> Best soap/shampoo on the planet.  Squeaky clean, no residue, no harmful chemicals.  Great skin, hair, and scalp health.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I mix it with water in squirt bottles and use it to clean my bathrooms and kitchen. I also use it in my swifter wet mop too to clean my floors. It leaves everything super clean, smelling great and disinfected. It also is gentle on all the surfaces I use it to clean. Love it!</li>
    <li> Attended a music and arts festival where this was the soap of choice.  Our family made the switch.  It&#x27;s great for cleaning body and face, as well as, hair.  The tea tree formula is perfect for our family as we have little children and tea tree is well known for preventing against lice.  We&#x27;ve never encountered it but with this we are hoping to avoid it :).  Also, Bronners can be used as a cleaner for your home.  Just dilute with a little water, spray, and wipe down.</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap for years, and so far, my skin has become even, healthier, clearer and less dry over time. Also has made my hair stronger, thicker and shinier. I love this soap so much, I&#x27;ve made converts out of friends and family because its great quality and you don&#x27;t have that filmy feeling you get with conventional soaps. I will never stop buying this product. Ever.</li>
    <li> Like their Peppermint variety better!! Would give it a 5! But this is good!!</li>
    <li> Love this soap! I am very sensitive to soaps and fragrances and this is the only type of soap I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin</li>
    <li> I love it!!!! I used on my hair and it worked great, deep cleaned, took all of the hair product build up off, I will use it for that about twice a month. Used it on my body, I felt squeaky clean. I used it in my laundry, clothes smelled terrific and looked very clean. I mixed in a spray bottle and used it to clean a very,very dirty piece of furniture that I bought at a garage sale that had been sitting uncovered for what looked like years, it is extremely clean now.  I will be using this on my dog who suffers with hot spots.I have siblings that have psoriasis around their hairline,it is going to take some convincing them to try this, but I will persevere. The price can&#x27;t be beat, I have seen this size bottle in stores for no less than $6 more</li>
    <li> Not wild about the smell, but am happy that it&#x27;s not leaving chemicals behind as I clean.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s simply amazing.  I use it on everything and I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m in danger with chemicals.</li>
    <li> I love this product it is great at lathering, is ethically made, and always consistent.  I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the tea tree as I have been a peppermint fan for many years, wanted a change.  I&#x27;ll go back to peppermint but only because of my personal preferences not the product.</li>
    <li> The best soap I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> These products are great for the skin and our entire family uses it.  Highly Recommend.</li>
    <li> Dr Bronners works great on my Wyoming dry skin! I will be keeping it for that. It left my thin fine hair oily and just never looking or feeling clean. It smells phenomenal in the washer, but my clothes had a dingy feel.  Works great for washing my hands but definitely not my dishes. They were spotty and filmy. Maybe I did something wrong, but I wasn&#x27;t as impressed a these other reviewers. I use citrus orange, fantastic smell and not horribly strong in the shower.</li>
    <li> With all the chemicals we have in our lives these days, it&#x27;s best to avoid the ones that you can.  I use this as shampoo, face, and body wash.  It&#x27;s a great product that happens to be natural as well.  Most shampoo is made with all sorts of cancer causing chemicals.  A little goes a long way.  This bottle will last a long time.</li>
    <li> works awesome son uses on his face for acne works where many other products didn&#x27;t</li>
    <li> I love this soap and have used it for many years.  Often wash my hair with it, too.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love the Tea Tree smell. I add my own essential oils to it also. Its a good soap. Give it a try.</li>
    <li> From cleaning kitchens and bathrooms to using it on your skin, this product can really do it all and we do!</li>
    <li> Great product! I love it! Used it to bath and wash my hair with! Make sure if you do use this to wash your hair dilute it first so it doesn&#x27;t strip your hair of its nutrients! This also lasted half year, even after I gave a bottle full to my mother and sister.</li>
    <li> love all dr bronners soaps</li>
    <li> I received this soap as part of a gift basket about a month ago, and in general I am pretty happy with it. It does a good job for a variety of household tasks such as hand washing and cleaning the various things around my apartment, but I would like to voice a couple concerns. Here are my pros and cons:&lt;br /&gt;  Pros:&lt;br /&gt;  1) This soap can handle a variety of messes. So far I haven&#x27;t found anything that this soap can&#x27;t do an adequate job of cleaning. (in my experience it has handled paint, oil, grease, and dirt very well)&lt;br /&gt;  2) I paint for a hobby and this soap takes the paint off my hands very well, and doesn&#x27;t dehydrate my skin as much as most other soaps.&lt;br /&gt;  3) The soap is very strong, and for that reason you only need a little do get the job done; which also makes it a good value.&lt;br /&gt;  4) It is &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;free trade&amp;#34;, which doesn&#x27;t hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Cons:&lt;br /&gt;  1) This soap is very pungent. Some people find the scent pleasant, but I do not. When I wash my hands with it, I can still smell the soap hours later. I find myself avoiding this soap  because of this.&lt;br /&gt;  2)  The bottle has what seems to be a ten page essay on it. There is just way to much going on in the label, and it is a pain to try and find the information such as dilution instructions, and suggested usages. Yea I can see how this makes the packaging more eco-friendly, but it also makes it annoying to use.&lt;br /&gt;  3) It can be harsh on sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I hope this is helpful!</li>
    <li> Just started using this soap in the shower after my roommate recommended it. I use all organic products for the body... except soap. I kept meaning to buy this but it was just so expensive. Now I see that it&#x27;s worth it - the bottle is huge, and you really only need a LITTLE BIT! Plus it has many uses, so it is well worth the price. And it smells great!</li>
    <li> Best soap out there, I don&#x27;t need to have it shipped yet to know that.&lt;br /&gt;Similarly priced in the Organic Store, but I don&#x27;t have to deal with parking in their lot&lt;br /&gt;or standing in line just for soap.  I love this stuff, and you will too if it&#x27;s something&lt;br /&gt;that you&#x27;ve never tried before, but are willing to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Bronner&#x27;s is Magic.</li>
    <li> I have other Dr Bronner&#x27;s liquid soaps and they have all been quality products. I bought this one because of the tea tree oil in it. I caught a foot fungus from a hotel shower. Tea tree oil cured it. Now I will travel with this to prevent another occurence.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got to say, I&#x27;d never realized how poorly my non-soap shower gel and facial cleaners performed until trying Dr. Bronner&#x27;s. I use it to clean my face and body. I tried it for laundry, and it performed phenomenally, though Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Sal Suds product is slightly cheaper with comparable results. Ditto for dishwashing. I must say, though, I&#x27;m a total convert. I get smoother skin. a closer shave, and and overall better clean from this soap than with any other.</li>
    <li> Great. Next time I will buy the larger size.</li>
    <li> Best soap in the world!</li>
    <li> The soap itself is great. I just cant believe I paid 18 bucks for it. I found out Fairway supermarket by me sells it for 11 bucks.</li>
    <li> have used this on my hair for year and as a body wash .good face cleanser no need for soap</li>
    <li> This has so many uses in our house that I&#x27;ll always have a bottle on hand.</li>
    <li> Have used Dr. Bronner&#x27;s on and off for years, and the quality and &#x27;clean&#x27; feeling the soap provides is excellent.  After rinsing off your skin, you are left with skin that is perfectly clean, without smoothing additives or lubricants(if you like that sorta thing I&#x27;d look elsewhere).  The organic, animal-cruelty free, and free trade aspects are much appreciated as well.  The scent&#x27;s are fairly strong - I normally use tea-tree and peppermint and they smell strong, but the odor does not linger long and should not a problem for sensitive users.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When some escapes from the plastic bottle, it will dry and create a film.  This is also why the soap will clog some hand pumps, due to exposure to air.  I use a 3 oz squeeze bottle with locking top and have not had problems like when using a pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean up and rinse away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all an excellent product that I will continue to use personally and recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this soap. Everything about it!&lt;br /&gt;Is it possible for a soap to have positive energy? I  am a huge fan of Lush cosmetics and this soap is of similar quality and the company has similar ethics. It always makes me happy to read the uplifting quotes on the bottle when I indulge in a hot, relaxing shower.&lt;br /&gt;I invested in a large bottle of the tea tree-18 in 1. I have problem skin. A mix of oily Mediterranean and delicate and sensitive Scandanavian. Tea tree has always worked well with my breakouts and other skin ailments, and boy has it worked well for me in this soap !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my face, every other day and it&#x27;s cleared my skin and has made my skin tone more even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has cleared up my whole body, actually. I get out of the shower feeling clean, and balanced. You feel traditionally &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; clean without feeling dry. I definitely have seen a difference in my skin. I wash areas with the soap after I shave and I have also noticed a decline in post-shaving related issues ( irritation, in- grown hairs).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also scrub my feet in the shower with it and soak my feet in it once a week, and it got rid of my athlete&#x27;s foot, I developed from hitting up the gym ( sorry if that&#x27;s TMI but if you have foot issues, this thing also works miracles).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for &amp;#34; head to toe&amp;#34;. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This product arrived on time as promised and in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I was curious about this because of so many great reviews. I am not quite sure about my final opinion since I have only been using it for a few days. The maker of the soap claims many uses for their soaps  (including brushing teeth??) and I guess ANY soap could be used 18 ways or more but as a practical matter I&#x27;m not so sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I bought the Tea Tree type expecting to get a tingly feeling, similar to Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Tea Tree shampoo....which I LOVE.&lt;br /&gt;I primarily was interested in using it as a body wash since the price places it in the Neutrogena price range. I liked the claims that it was a natural anti-bacterial.&lt;br /&gt;I used it full strength but can&#x27;t say it tingled. I used it un-diluted as a shaving cream. It did OK and did not break me out. I used as a body wash. It felt a little odd, made some lather but didn&#x27;t feel smooth or jellied like regular body wash. It did make me feel clean.&lt;br /&gt;I used it as a shampoo. It really cleans hair down to a squeaky clean and removed all oils and buildup. Some people may think it cleans TOO well on hair and may strip it of too much oil, but a conditioner was recommended and probably a good idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now....the bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me and to several of my friends..  in the bottle.....the Tea Tree soap smells STRONG and almost like Kerosene! One described it as a mix of Diesel Fuel and pine oil! I kind of agree. I&#x27;m not sure if that smell  stays with me when I wash with it but if it does, that will be a drawback. Maybe with some watering down or a follow up with another product will help, but that will defeat my purpose of using all natural product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At $16 a quart, I would not want to use this cleaner to scrub a toilet, wash dishes,  mop my floors or do anything like laundry with it. I may test it as a degreaser or use it at different dilutions just to see how that goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, not quite what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Does work well. Seemed to clear the ringworm on my thigh well enough. Not great for smell (acquired I suppose) or if you like to lather (lathering soap is apparently due to a &amp;#34;chemical romance&amp;#34; of not-so-eco-friendly ingredients). However, my favorite thing about this product is reading the bottle while I relax in the bath. Despite the obvious presence of mental illness, there is something kind of relaxing nonetheless about a guy wanting the world to be at peace and using a literal soapbox (or bottle) as a means to get it.</li>
    <li> This is the only soap I use in the shower......hair and all.&lt;br /&gt;I also have sensitive skin, and it doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I&#x27;m not a fan of the scent, but it&#x27;s not over powering.  Perfect for using after my workout.</li>
    <li> Soap smells great. I&#x27;ve used it to clean my shower, wash my hair once a week, and as a body wash. I dilute it with water because it is very harsh, but get&#x27;s the job done, while being all natural!</li>
    <li> A natural product that gives a #$*&amp; about what they do and who they do it with.  Check out all there products.  I use tree tea for the only shampoo I will put near my brain.</li>
    <li> I got this Body Wash because I read that tea tree oil is supposed to help treat both acne and body odor. As someone who frequently suffers from acne cysts, and awful body odor, I thought this would be a better alternative to body wash brands I have tried in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it about two weeks now, and it is the most oily body wash I have ever used in my life. If I were to try rubbing myself down with vegetable oil, using this stuff is probably what it would feel like. Except vegetable oil would smell better. This stuff smells terrible and about 4 hours after I shower I start smelling like BO again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also it is absolutely NOT for treating acne. After two weeks of use, I have more acne cysts, they have grown bigger, and are more painful than I remember them ever being before. I think this stuff has actually somehow made my acne worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It boggles the mind that so many people would give this product 5 stars. They must have been previously scrubbing their bodies with poo. Poo might actually be a worse substance to clean your body with. But I&#x27;m not 100% sure on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next I will be trying Phisoderm anti-blemish body wash. It contains 2% Salicylic Acid, which is the active ingredient in Clearasil. I use Clearasil on my face and it works pretty good, but Clearasil is expensive, comes in small quantities, and doesn&#x27;t have a body wash. I hope the Phisoderm will work, but Phisoderm also comes in small bottles. I wish I could find an anti-acne body wash that works, and buy it in bulk. If Clearasil made a body wash, I would probably use it for life...</li>
    <li> I have used this to bathe my dogs, they usually are extremely itchy after bathing but with this they have had no itching issues. It took only a small amount to bathe both dogs, excellent lather. I will certainly be using it for other uses as well. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t learned what all I can do with this soap yet...I&#x27;m still experimenting!  But so far, I love it!</li>
    <li> I bought this product to try in my skin-care routine. For that, it doesn&#x27;t work for me. However, I&#x27;m sure I can find a household use for it. I do like the smell.</li>
    <li> The soap is great, it&#x27;s organic, and it has an invigorating sent.  Didn&#x27;t like the mint one much cuz it leaves you a lil cold getting out of the shower, but lavender has been very good.</li>
    <li> Just bought this soap, (not on amazon) the local health food store was selling (and for less money); Anyways, it&#x27;s a great product, I&#x27;ve only tried it one day so far, but it does leave a fresh clean feeling, and I&#x27;m impressed with the product. I would have given it more stars if I could.. lots of good product for a fair price! :)</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t smell real good but helps your skin.</li>
    <li> Love this soap.  Quick delivery, happy.  I use it for my household cleaner recipes, so the big bottle lasts a while.</li>
    <li> I have always loved Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps. But it&#x27;s been years since I&#x27;ve used them. Needing to treat a reoccurring skin condition with tea tree oil and medicated washes, I was reminded of these products in my search for a solution. I&#x27;d never used this \\&quot;flavor\\&quot; before. True to reputation,  it did not disappoint.  It lathers up very nicely and easily rinses away leaving your skin very clean without a slippery or filmy residue. The scent left behind is light and clean, not noxious and medicinal. My skin looks and feels a lot nicer too. This, along with the help of espson/ sea salt and vinegar soaks, is really clearing up my skin.</li>
    <li> Love the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps.  A tiny squirt is all you need for hair.  Use on body and face also if you like.  I use it as my only soap in the shower and the 32 oz. lasts for months.</li>
    <li> Unlike big Unilever, maker of Dove, Dr. Bronner does not combines ultra-fine exfoliating beads to clear away the old, dull skin with its moisturizing milk to nurture new, radiant skin. Micro Beads are fine plastic sand that end up in ocean causing harm to everything from fish to environment. What a disgrace/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently Dr. Bronner donated some $620,883 dollars in favor of prop 37, GM labelling since that is what an honest and descent company does if they have nothing to hide in their ingredients and Dr. Bronner has nothing other than the finest organic ingredients. CERTIFIED FAIR TRADE INGREDIENTS...  I use the Baby Wash formula as shampoo and body soap with ingredients of wWater, Organic Coconut Oil, Potassium Hydroxide, Organic Olive Oil, Organic Hemp Oil, Organic Jojoba Oil, Citric Acid, Tocopherol. No perfume or additives at all. I mix it with the same amount of water and wolla... I used to purchase one gallon few years ago but these days the price of one gallon is the same as four 32 oz and now I purchase 32 oz without storing the balance of one gallon. I replace the cap with a pump and use the bottle. I add no oil or what so ever since I am not going to use apple cider to wash the oil away. It is a simple product without any complication or garbage. So difficult to get anything simple without any additives these days but luckily the Baby Wash is one of the simple, all organic ingredients out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Tea formula smells different but for deeper cleaning tea is better. I use it only as a body soap and shampoo on the days that I pump iron and place Vaseline on my skin otherwise the Baby Wash is the one I generally use with no smell, nothing except pure organic cleaner without any additives. According to a study from the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology, individuals who used a shampoo with 5% tea tree oil reduced their dandruff 41% and significantly improved the itchiness and greasiness of their scalp. well there we go, other benefit of this beauty.benefit of this beauty.</li>
    <li> I read a review of this on Pinterest for cleaning metal pans. I then visited Amazon and bought it right away. The reviews were right. I spread it on let it set for about 25 minutes and the pans came out looking like new. I have also used it to clean patio furniture with great results.</li>
    <li> I love this soap.  I have used it to refill my foam hand soaps and have used it for shampoo and it works great.</li>
    <li> Works great, love the smell, feels good and strong. I really feel clean, not just chemical making me feel good so I think that I am...</li>
    <li> Love this stuff...pricing was better than local stores and online.</li>
    <li> This is a unique soap. It definitely makes you feel clean, but in a totally different sense of &amp;#34;feel.&amp;#34; Because it is all natural and includes tea tree oil, it actually removes much of the natural oils off of your skin. Other soaps are designed to leave you feeling slippery clean, but this one is actually designed to remove the oil off of your skin (and of course, bringing all of that nasty dirt and body odor with it)! I use this a few times a week in combination with my other body wash. It&#x27;s a great buy for people with oily skin or Athlete&#x27;s foot. I like using it on my face too since I have an oily skin complexion. All in all, a great product that lasts a long time! I would recommend this product. Blessings!</li>
    <li> DON&#x27;t EAT SOAP OK!  Nothing will get you cleaner.  Best soap in the all one universe!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Tea Tree soap for years.  I&#x27;ve tried other brands of similar soaps, but nothing compares to Dr. Bronner&#x27;s.  Love this stuff and the tea tree is good for people, like diabetics, who tend to get skin infections like cellulitis.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this because I wanted to reward Dr. Bronners for supporting the GMO labeling initiative here in Washington State.  It narrowly lost, but we&#x27;ll try again.  I had never heard of their products before.  I tried it and I like it a lot.  I feel clean and invigorated after I use it.  I will be buying more of their products in the future.</li>
    <li> Got a nasty bout of folliculitis on Monday.  Bought this on Thursday and started using it immediately.  Not sure it has helped with the folliculitis yet as it is a rather bad case, BUT my rough scaly feet have never been softer or smoother!!  Also, I was expecting my skin to feel dry as this soap did not have petrolatum in it (suggested by my dermatologist for my dry skin), but I was surprised to find that my skin actually felt less dry with this soap than what the doc recommended!  So far,I think it&#x27;s a keeper.  I will update my review if I discover more results.</li>
    <li> Love this soap! You can&#x27;t go wrong with using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product for many skin problems. My grandchild has eczema and it worked great to help clear it up.</li>
    <li> I am a 21 year old female who has struggled with acne since around the age of 15 or so. I had tried EVERYTHING from ProActiv, Biore, Neutrogena, and Burts Bees. As of late I have started to be more conscientious of the chemicals in my food and personal care products. While doing some research I came across Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Tea Tree Soap and I am SO GLAD I DID. I had suffered cystic acne since my Ob/Gyn had put me on birth control pills, which continued even after I stopped the pills. After ONE use of this product the blemishes I had on my face were drying up and the cysts were less angry and inflamed. Within a week my face had no white or blackheads and the cysts were much smaller! My face now is perfectly clear other than the occasional pimple on my cheek which I usually blame my hair products for. I will warn new users though, your skin will be extra dry for the first couple weeks but my skin seems to have adjusted and stays nice and supple without any extra moisturizers. This is literally the ONLY product that touches my face! I love this stuff! It&#x27;s a great natural cleanser and acne cure!</li>
    <li> I have been trying all the Dr Bronner&#x27;s liquid soaps. This is the one I like the least so far - among peppermint, almond, citrus. It smells like toilet bowl cleaner. I don&#x27;t dislike it enough to throw out - I will use the whole bottle. But, I won&#x27;t get it again. One positive is that it seems to lather better than the others - requiring less product than the other three.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years. I use it as a body wash, shampoo (on my dreadlocks), and also to wash other things. It really is my favorite thing to hand wash items when they become dirty/stained/stinky. I also love that you really only need a little bit at a time.</li>
    <li> Great stuff!  I have my daughter use this for controlling her teenage acne.  Has served her well !</li>
    <li> Helps with my dry skin, better than store bought soap.</li>
    <li> Leaves me squeaky clean</li>
    <li> I just feel cleaner when I use this soap. It doesn&#x27;t leave any of the grimy soap residue that other soaps do.</li>
    <li> Skin feels nice and clean after use. I also wash my hair with it and it&#x27;s great! It&#x27;s great for cleansing acne prone skin fyi...</li>
    <li> This great for any kind of stages of acne. It really cleans the surface of the skin and has tea tree which is a plus plus. It contains citric acid to lighten skin, specially acne scars. I only use a couple drops and the foam up so quickly. My friend had given me this so I didn&#x27;t really have a set out purpose but after reading the ingredients I just knew it would help with acne. All these soaps can really be used for many things. This is an honest review and I&#x27;m gonna purchase the big bottle before I&#x27;m even done this my current one. BUY THIS NOW</li>
    <li> We use it daily to wash ourselves from head to toe! Works like a charm! Helped with my acne too!</li>
    <li> It smells weird, which I could get past if it worked well. All it did is make my skin feel like rubber by time I got out of the shower. No amount of lotion could get me away from the dried out feeling and almost ticky demeanor of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was bizarre! No matter how long I waited it was a chore just to get clothes on after being dried off. I ended up going with &amp;#34;everyone&amp;#34; body wash. It&#x27;s a great alternative if you&#x27;re looking for low toxicity ratings. Cheers!</li>
    <li> I love this soap.  I bought the Tea Tree, Almond and Orange.  These soaps are perfect.&lt;br /&gt;I use the Tea Tree hemp oil and make my own hand soap.  Like I said, I love this soap!</li>
    <li> I love this soap. I use it to wash my body and my face every day. I used to have uneven skin and a little bit of acne, now my skin is even and as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom. :) I love it! Not to mention it&#x27;s 100% vegan, and not tested on animals!</li>
    <li> LUV this product.  ALL natural, great healthy clean feeling, no residue from chemicals, great smell.  Tea tree has many healthy benefits.  Been using all varieties of Dr. Bonner&#x27;s Magic Soaps for years &amp; will continue.  Bottles are also very inspiring to read!  KEEP UP THE GREAT PRODUCT DR BONNER; will continue to purchase.....usually I buy the gallons, but this one is nice for shower stall &amp; for the variety of different scents.</li>
    <li> only used once so far...</li>
    <li> This is great. Lasts forever. Smells clean. Will purchase again. :)</li>
    <li> Always been a great product, now easy to get through Amazon.</li>
    <li> I use this stuff as a shampoo and body wash. It could get to be a little oily if used as a shampoo for some people but I have curly hair so I actually like that part. Some may not. It is a great soap for cleaning your body. I haven&#x27;t used it in any other way but I&#x27;m sure it would do great!</li>
    <li> We love Bronner&#x27;s soap....i love that I can use it for anything..laundry, dish detergent, shampoo or body wash. We mainly use it at home for body wash though and hand soap. This soap is great when you travel. You don&#x27;t have to bring different kind of soaps. My husband use this to wash after he trains BJJ.</li>
    <li> I use the tea tree soap for dish detergent and so far it worked wonders!  I had a bit of ants problem in my kitchen and noticed that ever since I used tea tree soap to wash dishes, kitchen towels, and wipe counter surface with it, that area now has fewer ants, almost none!  Very happy with this multipurpose and yet environmentally friendly product!</li>
    <li> I have scalp psoriasis/eczema and pure tea tree oil has done wonders for my skin problems. But the only problem is that like any other pure essential oil, it&#x27;s very potent so the scent is very over powering when used in large amounts when applied straight from the bottle so I thought I&#x27;d try this soap to see if it would help without making my whole house smell like the oil. Unfortunately, all it did was make my scalp even more irritated and my hair: a big oily/sticky/filmy buildup since the very first time I used it. I also read a lot of complaints about using this soap as a shampoo and I can see why. A lot of them said that it left their hair extremely dry but in my case, it was more of the opposite. The condition of my hair got so bad to the point were I couldn&#x27;t even brush or comb it without a few strands sticking out to the side. I also tried using it as a face and body wash as well and still, it was the same feeling as I described my hair. With all that being said, if your&#x27;e going to clean your hair, face, and body with something other than ordinary shampoo and soap that is normally found in stores, this is definitely not a product to be messing with. There are cheaper and more effective methods to do this like the baking soda/vinegar rinse which I found very helpful with the itching from my scalp psoriasis. You can even use one, the other, or both of the baking soda and vinegar for your face/body, replace your ordinary toxic household cleaners, pets, and basically all the other things that this soap claims to be useful for, only at a very small fraction of the cost. Plus, you can find them in any grocery store. So like I said, don&#x27;t even waste your money!!! It&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this soap. It does a decent job of making me feel clean, with no off-putting residue or film after use. The smell, however, is atrocious. It is so strong and overwhelming, that I feel somewhat light headed if I take a direct whiff from the container. I have had tea tree shampoo in the past which was tingly, pleasant smelling, and relaxing... this smells like I am squeezing Pine-sol directly on my loofah. I have purchased the almond soap in the past, which was pretty nice, but I will not purchase this scent again.</li>
    <li> Works great and came as expected. This price is cheaper than the price at our local store however, it still seems like a lot to pay for soap. It lasts a long time though, we added water and soap to a foaming hand pump and it works great.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite products because it is so versatile. Not only can you use it as-is, but as an ingredient in other home products. A must-have if you like to use natural products, which this is.</li>
    <li> What a great product. Try it...you will like it.</li>
    <li> I love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s. This product leaves my skin feeling so clean. I highly recommend it to anyone who has acne, or other skin conditions.</li>
    <li> Always love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps. This one is pleasant.</li>
    <li> I put this in a liquid soap dispenser and use it for a face wash and body wash.  I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Great soap. My wife and I share the large bottle and it works well and smells nice. You can use it when camping and you need to take a quick swim to wash off. No chemicals and a little goes a long way. buy it!</li>
    <li> I was previously using a tea tree body bar bought from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply, as I have some trouble with clogged pores on my shoulders and upper back and the bar was suggested to me.  While I found the bar wonderful I prefer body wash over a bar of soap, so I did a little searching to see if I could find something that would suit my needs.  I have been using this for roughly a month now and it is wonderful, I have honestly never felt so clean in my life.  I have currently only used it as a body wash, despite it&#x27;s long list of abilities, and it works wonders on my skin.  I don&#x27;t have near the trouble with clogged pores that I have before, they have all but completely disappeared.  While the smell itself is not too great, it isn&#x27;t a scent that I feel lingers with you.  I have also had quite a problem with dry skin, which this has vastly improved, due to that I intend on trying it out as a shampoo maybe once a week to see if it will help with my dry scalp.  I have also contemplated using it on my dog, as she has severe dry skin and itches like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-UPDATE-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have since used this product in order to try to treat my dogs flaky skin, while it works quite well it doesn&#x27;t solve the problem entirely.  She seems to itch less after being bathed, but it is only a few days before she starts itching again.  This is of course due to her skin type &amp; the fact that she can&#x27;t be bathed frequently (as I don&#x27;t want to dry up all the oils in her skin).  However, it is still a wonderful product to use to help alleviate some of her itching.</li>
    <li> I have used Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap for years and have yet to be disappointed with any of the products.  Each one is made with real plant based scents that are not only wonderful to smell.... especially the almond.... but perfect for those who may have allergies to chemical based scents.  In just a short time, my skin began to look more healthy and hydrated as all the soaps have olive oil and coconut oil in them.  This is a marked difference from certain name brand soaps that left my skin dry, flaky and even painful.  The more expensive price of these soaps may be a deterrent for some, but I have not had to buy body wash and only use lotion after doing dishes, etc. and so have cut the expense in those ways.  Another added benefit is the fact that these soaps have absolutely no harsh chemicals, perfumes or environmentally UN-friendly ingredients that can lead to allergies, expensive skin problems or even cancer!  When seen in that light, it&#x27;s well worth the price!!</li>
    <li> So happy I found a chemical free solution for my eczema. My husband loves it as well, it&#x27;s very cooling for the summertime too! 32 oz is going to last me a good 6 months to a year!! As for as the reviewers that complain about the smell, it&#x27;s TEA TREE. Dr. Bronner&#x27;s offers other scents, I&#x27;ve smelled the almond and lavender, both very nice. If you don&#x27;t like the scent of Tea Tree, this soap isn&#x27;t for you. As for me, I&#x27;ll certainly keep buying!!</li>
    <li> I have been using Dr. Bronners soaps for over 30 years now and if you have never tried these fabulous, wonderful products, you are missing one of the best overall personal care products on the planet. Have used, still use peppermint, tea tree, euco.. liquid soaps. No hard, filler soaps!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this soap.  It&#x27;s gentle but effective and the scent is invigorating and not to-long-lasting post-shower.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I will use Dr. Bronner&#x27;s forever. It helps so much with my acne</li>
    <li> As a shampoo, how I use it, this is likely to last a LONG time.  A dime sized amount washes my hair (short hair) and leaves it feeling very clean.  Smells good and I like the limited ingredients.  It is very, very runny though....think water, so using it is not as easy as the thicker shampoo&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Go natural with Dr. Bronner. soaps. it feels good!</li>
    <li> I love all the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps, but this is my new favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May not be appropriate for people with dry skin, but I&#x27;ve never had to worry about that. My main problem is oily skin, and this is just the ticket for that.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of Dr.Bronners. I have very sensitive skin and shaving my legs used to cause such dry skin that I would scratch my legs till they bled. Now I use Dr. Bronners, and as long as I moisturise daily my legs are silt smooth. I also use it to wash my face with great results.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Perfectly packaged</li>
    <li> Makes me feel squeaky clean. I use it to wash clothes sometimes and even to mop the floor.</li>
    <li> Great soap!!!  You actually feel healthier just for using it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving it two stars instead of one because they actually use good ingredients. What a nut job this guy was personally! I don&#x27;t appreciate all the religious rants, which make no sense, on this product. Isn&#x27;t it enough to have your values represented in the ingredients and fair trade affiliation? I&#x27;m returning the product because I don&#x27;t want to support whack jobs like this and his family, who continue to keep the label as a memorial to Dr. Bronner. The only thing it&#x27;s a memorial to, is/are how crazy he and his family are/was. They would all do well to enroll in a business ethics 101 course. I&#x27;d hate to know how much money they are they flushing down the toilet because of their nut job rants on the label. Dr. Bronner actually spent time in mental institutions!  What a shame, I acutally wanted to buy this product.  http://www.adweek.com/adfreak/dr-bronner-s-crazy-ass-magic-soap-labels-18606</li>
    <li> i am a self-proclaimed cosmetic junkie... the kind of person that never buys the same shampoo/body wash/moisturizer twice. i like to try new things, new scents, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;that said, dr. bronner&#x27;s is one product that i will continue to buy again and again and again. i have normal skin that is dry in the winter and can be a bit oily in the summer. my face LOVES this stuff. it helped clear up some strange bumps that popped up on my forehead and seems to have evened out my skin&#x27;s texture overall. it also dissolves even the smokiest of eye makeup and cakiest of foundation with ease. amazingly, it doesn&#x27;t hurt if you get it in your eyes. seriously. warm water + dr. bronner&#x27;s &#x3D; magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but i don&#x27;t just use it on my face! the tea tree oil (which is used for itchy skin, dry scalp, and to treat some fungus) has helped the rest of my body stay clean and itch and flake-free through the brutal winter months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is an all-around feel good product that i absolutely love.</li>
    <li> Great for healing hypotrophic scarring (or bumps) on or around piercings.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!  It leaves you feeling fresh and clean while also helping to decrease skin problems and maintain blemish free skin.  As a Peace Corps volunteer, I&#x27;ve had problems with skin fungus and this has helped to clear it up and maintain healthy skin.  I also use this product for washing my clothes because harsh detergents irritate my skin, causing rashes, and in my country of service I don&#x27;t have access to fancy allergen free detergents so I have been using this as my detergent and my skin hasn&#x27;t had any problems for the 12 months.  This bottle lasted me almost a year and now I&#x27;m ordering it again to get me through the rest of my service!  Thanks Dr. Bronner!</li>
    <li> I always keep a large bottle of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Tea Tree Oil on hand.  It&#x27;s wonderful for safely disinfecting my cat&#x27;s litter box, my fish tank when I change the water, as well as for emergency shampoo, athlete&#x27;s foot prevention, or any household disinfecting.  Safe and effective soap that I trust for antibacterial, antifungal, and antiseptic purposes.</li>
    <li> Superior quality castille soap / shampoo.  Lasts an incredibly long time;  have been using a smaller bottle for over two months, and still haven&#x27;t used it up.  Lathers very well, and leaves hair and skin incredibly clean without drying out.  Highly recommended product!</li>
    <li> I mix half Dr. Bronners and half water with a few drops of pure Tea Tree oil and use it for deodorant. It works like a charm!</li>
    <li> Love this brand. My friends think it leaves the bathroom with a chemical scent but I don&#x27;t think so.. I love the smell! I was kind of disappointed that it did not leave my body tingly but still a great body wash.</li>
    <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;I badly wanted to like that soap for two reasons:I like that it removes body smell efficiently and the way it looks.It just feels clean!BUT i have the worst reaction to this soap ever and I am not an allergy person...I HAVE NO ALLERGIES.The liquid soap made my eyes swell up,I looked as if i had a bee sting,the firm soap has caused the worst rash on shoulders and legs....&lt;br /&gt;I implore people with sensitive skin to avoid that soap at all price. And I swim in Chlorine water everyday..so I am not even that sensitive.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve use Dr. Bonner&#x27;s liquid soaps for a year now and have enjoyed their all-organic ingredients. I use the soaps primarily for body wash and a little goes a long way. I&#x27;m giving this product 3-star out of 5 only because I think the Tea Tree scent is a bit strong for my taste. I just finished a bottle of the Eucalyptus and enjoyed that scent more. Overall I would give the soap a 4-5 star for is multi-use, including body soap, household cleaner, laundry detergent, leather conditioner, and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap makes my bath water &amp;#34;cling&amp;#34; to my skin when I rinse off, but this is likely due to the hard water I have where I live. I recently bought the Dr. Bonner lip balm, which I love and can&#x27;t wait to try the hair conditioner.</li>
    <li> Soap is great like anyone who is looking at this soap already knows. I&#x27;ve had other tea tree products before and none of them smelled this medicinal. I&#x27;ll be sticking with peppermint.</li>
    <li> Smells good and cleans well. So concentrated the bottle will last for eons.</li>
    <li> Love every single Dr bronners&#x27;s except the peppermint scent. Seriously, DONT BUY THE PEPPERMINT. I use this for my body and hair and feel good knowing I am not using harmful chemicals that are in many other soaps.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as good as the bar version of this soap. It&#x27;s too runny to use easily with a bath pouf</li>
    <li> Great stuff for washing pets.  Good for skin/coat.</li>
    <li> love dr. bonner products</li>
    <li> I swear by this - even good for clothes</li>
    <li> I began using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s about two years ago. I use for showering and shampooing. Great product!</li>
    <li> I love Dr. Bronners soaps, they&#x27;re of good quality and I love the tree tea oil one specifically. It really helps with my acne and my skin feels way better. It&#x27;s the only soap I use.</li>
    <li> This is the 4th or 5th time I&#x27;ve repurchased this product. I used to get mild back breakouts so I started using it after my gym sessions where my skin ends up coming in contact with mats and equipment other people frequently use and I have been clear ever since. The product itself is pretty watery but a little goes a long way. I use with my regular puff when showering and it lathers extremely well. I bought a mini travel bottle as well and just refill it from this bottle. I also bought the bar soap version as well and keep it by the sink. Awesome products!</li>
    <li> Anyone who grew up in the South knows the smell of the cleaning solution our mothers used to clean the bathroom and kitchen floors.  It was Pine-Sol.  Add a splash to a bucket of water and mop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Tea Tree Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Soap is Pine-Sol: it smells like Pine-Sol and when poured in  water it turns milky.  It is excellent at getting your body squeaky clean but, the smell is atrocious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stick with the Hemp Peppermint Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Pure-Castile Soap.  It smells great and cleans just as well</li>
    <li> excellent for keeping old skin healthly.</li>
    <li> We used the whole bottle over the last six months and it has been great for my skin. Always makes you feel clean, and the bottle has positive messages printed all over it to give you reading material in the shower. I am a fan, and will be buying more.</li>
    <li> This soap is magic for skin conditions but I wish it wasn&#x27;t so watery!  I also prefer the scent of the Tea Tree hand soap.</li>
    <li> i absolutely love this soap for everything to washing my hair down to my toes! it has a great fresh smell.  i have been using dr. bronner&#x27;s for over 2 years and haven&#x27;t bought anything but it since.</li>
    <li> A nice touch to my homemade laundry soap. Took about a tablespoon to make it sudsier and thicker. Extra cleaning power. Smells nice.</li>
    <li> I like the soaps made by this company and use them diluted in a special foam dispenser.  They make a great foaming hand cleanser that is much better at cleaning than any liquid hand soap that I&#x27;ve tried.  I just really dislike the smell (stink) of this particular tea tree soap. It&#x27;s strong and the smell seems to stay on my hands for a good while after washing.  I like the Almond&#x27;s smell a lot and it is much less intense and is noticeable for a much shorter time.  While I like the smell of Peppermint I don&#x27;t care for the smell of their Peppermint version either, but it is nothing compared to the smell of their tea tree soap.  For me the smell alone is enough to lower its rating a couple stars.  No other reviewer has mentioned this so I appear to be a minority opinion on this.  But I&#x27;d recommend trying to smell it in a store first or buying a smaller bottle to be sure you will like it before springing for the large 32oz bottle - it will last you a very long time.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this, it smells up my whole house after my showers...and the customer service is great as well!!!!...I will continue to buy this product as long as I can.</li>
    <li> I first bought Dr. Bronner&#x27;s bar soup.  But I&#x27;m not a bar soap fan.  So I bought this to put into my foaming hand pump.  It works great.  Safe antibacterial soap for my self and my kids.  I wish more people realized how unhealthy &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; antibacterial soap is for them.  The smell isn&#x27;t too strong.  My husband isn&#x27;t a fan of the smell of tea tree oil, but he hasn&#x27;t complained about this.  Thinking I will try peppermint next.</li>
    <li> I use it every day to wash my hair and body.  I like it much better than any other bodywash, soap, or shampoo I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I would change is adding the ability to subscribe to this product.</li>
    <li> The best soap ever, and order was exceptional</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t even write reviews but I felt so obliged to recommend Dr. Bronners!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Tea Tree Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap is the BEST thing for my face.  I&#x27;ve tried countless other products to help with mild acne and dry skin, and none of them worked long term and I did not like the harsh chemicals that left my skin feeling dry- if clear.  This soap is so gentle and always leaves my skin feeling clean but never dry.  There are no harsh chemicals in it, only natural products.  Since it is very concentrated, I like to mix about 1 part Bronner&#x27;s to ~3 parts water in a foam pump bottle.  The great thing is that you can mess with the recipe to find the perfect balance for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The peppermint is wonderfully refreshing in the summer or after a good workout.  My girlfriend loves a squirt in her bath for the wonderfully aromatic and cooling qualities.  The almond flavor is amazing!  It smells like sweet almond cookies!  It&#x27;s great for winter.  I might just try and eat it one day it smells so good.  The Eucalyptus is also a nice scent, and feels as though it opens my nose a bit.  I use the unscented kind to clean my cat.  It&#x27;s great because it&#x27;s extra gentle - especially used for babies - and does not have any natural oils like peppermint which may irritate extremely sensitive skin.  I have also found nothing which cleans my stainless steel so well!  One wipe and my safety razor and bathroom hardware is looking brand new!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also the perfect soap for camping because: 1) it&#x27;s concentrated 2) it&#x27;s biodegradable 3) it&#x27;s got so many uses&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how the product is made with organic and fair trade, natural products.  The company is a family run organization who is very pro-active in the fair trade, GMO labeling, and hemp legalization efforts.  I&#x27;m so glad to support them!  Follow the company on Facebook!</li>
    <li> So good so far, thinking about buying it by the gallon.</li>
    <li> My all time favorite soap, I use this on me and my mother. Mainly for bath and showers. This tea tree helps with ant-bacterial. We both have sensitive skin so it really cleanse your body to the tee and its very gentle. I also mix this with neem oil when we shower. The smell is not bad to me at all. Just a medicine strong menthal smell, I love it. I also have it sat out in my bathroom for people to use when they wash their hands. A good ant-bacterial solution. I love all Dr Bronner&#x27;s soap try the peppermint and almond soap too.</li>
    <li> Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps aren&#x27;t loaded down with unpronounceable chemicals. I feel really clean and have the positive effects of natural aromatherapy. The peppermint soap actually leaves you feeling super refreshed. We use all the different aromas they have to offer. No other soap comes into our home!</li>
    <li> I have been using Dr. Bonners soap for a few years, and will continue too. Love the products!</li>
    <li> This soap is amazing, I have never felt so clean and refreshed with any other soap! It also helps with skin conditions, but you&#x27;ll need to moisturize after showering because it may dry you out a bit. Overall an excellent product.</li>
    <li> If you like tea tree oil and Dr Bronners, this is the product for you!!  Seriously, though, it&#x27;s not the prettiest smelling one, but it great for soothing itchy or blemished skin, and other things.  Have used it on and off for years.  For scent, I&#x27;d not use this all the time - Tea Tree oil is pretty intense - not awful, just strong.</li>
    <li> ALWAYS MADE MY SKIN LOOK RADIANT</li>
    <li> No better soap than Bronner&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> Living in the tropics, this soap helps with reducing fungal issues.  Smells good too.</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap on and off for a few months. I like the way my skin feels after using it. Be prepared for the novel on the label.</li>
    <li> It leaves my hair feeling clean and soft. Lather feels nice. smells good. Clears up a dirty scalp. one bottle goes a long way</li>
    <li> Love Dr. Bronners tea tree is an awesome soap. I dilute it 1:1 with water so it lasts longer. It dries out my skin if it&#x27;s too strong.</li>
    <li> I ordered this shampoo based on other reviews and I am very happy with it.  It smells a little earthy/mediciney(?) but it does take away any bad odor you are dealing with, in my case it was my hair.  I tried everything from expensive to very strong smelling shampoos.  This one has worked perfectly and it only takes a small amount to lather up.  The only draw back is make sure you follow it up wth conditioner and dont use it everyday.  It leaves your hair very tangled and not smooth.  But I am very happy with it and will continue to use this product and since it only takes a small amount this bottle will last a while</li>
    <li> I Love this stuff! I use it on my beard and it doesn&#x27;t dry it out - better than shampoo!</li>
    <li> For quite some time I was dealing with issues of cystic acne on my chin.  At 29 that form of acne had never been a problem for me.  I starting reducing certain chemical items in my skin care and adding others.  I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that SLS was causing the cystic acne.  With this product assisting with flareups I was able to keep it under control and have had decent skin since starting a few months ago.  I don&#x27;t feel this product over-dries your skin and is quite gentle.  There are plenty of natural helping ingredients used that are non-irritating on the face.  Besides this product I use Thayer&#x27;s Rose Petal Witch Hazel and Tea Tree Oil with Benzoyl Peroxide from Create Cosmetics.  I also use Elta-MD UV Clear SPF 45 and La-Roch Posay Toleriane Lotion.  I would say that my skin is smooth (I also use a retinol at night) and normal moisture.  Sometimes I do have a dry forehead but I feel it is contributed to by wearing a side bang.  I normally don&#x27;t over-endorse anything but I feel I need to share my regimen for the sake of others who may be struggling with adult acne.  Give it a try if you just can&#x27;t figure out what&#x27;s contributing to your skin care concerns.  So far it&#x27;s working for me.</li>
    <li> I like it but really wish there was more specific information for how to use it on the bottle rather than having to look it up.</li>
    <li> Love this! Theres nothing better than a natural/cruelty-free product that really gets the job done. I use this everyday and would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Love Dr Bonner&#x27;s Castile soap! Can be used for so many different things such as bathing, laundry, surface cleaner, for your pets etc.. Castile soap tends to leave my skin a little dry but I like that. (I sometimes have oily skin) Also this soap is potent so a Nickle size worth is enough to wash your face. Its a soap you can feel good about!</li>
    <li> Very nice, works well with what I like to make for my family</li>
    <li> OMG I mixed it one part dr bronners 2 parts water and washed my face with it for the first time. When I got out of the bath all the acne I has was instantly ready to pop. I have sensitive skin and acne and this is the first thing I have tried that works. I am in love. I also use it as bath soap and hand soap. Diluting it works best it&#x27;s strong two squirts in a bath tub smells up the house. Lasts forever I have tried all the other scents this is by far my favorite because of its magical acne healing property&#x27;s. I love dr. Bronners but never expected it to work this well on my acne. Will update to see if my face stays clear.</li>
    <li> I have used nothing else on my body or in my household but Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Lavender, Tea Tree Oil, Eucalyptus, Peppermint and the unscented since the late sixties. It even brings out a bit of my youth on certain occasions and certain times. Love that Lavender!</li>
    <li> No indication that this stuff has any special properties whatsoever for antifungal or use for skin irritations. No sign of any benefit from the Tea Tree oil content.</li>
    <li> I have tried Castile soap form a different maker and loved the effect as a shampoo for my scalp. I did my research and found Castile soap by Dr. Bronners that came in different variants to address different needs. I chose to purchase from this seller as it was cheaper than others especially for this 32oz bottle. The tea tree may not be of a sufficient quantity to have medicinal effects but knowing that the base is of Castile soap is already a plus to me. I just add in a few more drops of tea tree oil and other essential oils to achieve the effect I need. I use this on my shih tzu (with a few drops of EVCO) and it really cleans his coat and rinses fast and very well. This bottle will last me a long time. I love it!</li>
    <li> I picked this up as a possible alternative treatment for rosacea after reading a few things about tea tree oil and it&#x27;s benefits. While I cannot report that this is the cure all for that horrible condition I can say that this wonderful castille soap has become my daily use face and body wash. Using a foamer I create a diluted version with about 1/3 fill of the soap plus some pure tea tree oil extract, and orange and lemon oil extracts, and it makes for a wonderful daily wash. Very gentle and does seems to help quite a bit.</li>
    <li> Despite the paragraphs of lunacy scribbled along the product labels of their bottles, Dr. Bronner Magic Soaps are surprisingly useful.&lt;br /&gt;I wash my psoriasis-ridden scalp with this once or twice daily, rigorously massaging it into my scalp to lift any excess scaliness.&lt;br /&gt;Using this often will probably cause your hair to dry out so I&#x27;d look for a conditioner to follow up with.&lt;br /&gt;It can be used as body soap because it is a great oder remover. It doesn&#x27;t smell the greatest though (it smells like tea tree, you know?).</li>
    <li> Smells great, lasts forever, cleans well. Best castille soap I&#x27;ve ever used. Great as dog shampoo also. It relieved my dogs&#x27; dry itchy skin</li>
    <li> Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products are amazing and we highly recommend everything that they have to offer.  Perfect for problem skin!  Lots of other uses as well.</li>
    <li> Smells great and very effective.</li>
    <li> We appreciate the product.&lt;br /&gt;We are going to enjoy using them for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much for the product.</li>
    <li> Good for your skin and smells nice.</li>
    <li> The first thing I noticed about this soap is that it smells pretty bad while you&#x27;re using it.  However, once you dry off it smells good.  The second thing I noticed was how concentrated it was.  You really only a tiny amount if you&#x27;re using a loofah or washcloth, especially compared to normal soaps.  One of the downsides of the high concentration of this soap is that it can leave you feeling like it&#x27;s still on you, so you may want to take extra time to rinse off.</li>
    <li> I recently got a lot of tattoo work done, and my artist suggested this stuff to clean it. well, it has been a few weeks and the tattoo is healing nicely. however, I was out of face wash and i have this huge bottle laying around and I decided to use it. wow, after a few uses on my face, my acne was noticeably going away. This stuff is awesone.</li>
    <li> My favorite soap for face and body, not great for hair though. Not unlike the original directions that used to be on the bottle, I find this soap works best if you wet down your body and then turn off the water. Using as little as possible (I mean drops, this soap goes far), work into the skin, and do your whole body head-to-toe. When the soaps sits on the skin for a minute as you wash everything, it rinses very cleanly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t use too much, I don&#x27;t find this soap to be drying at all. Same goes for the scent: just don&#x27;t go overboard pouring it into your hand. This bottle should last one person a long time.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing..make homemade wipes to shampoo...</li>
    <li> I love all Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soap products and the Tea Tree performs as expected! The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 Stars is that Tea Tree aroma is SUPER strong and is almost overwhelming to the senses. The Tea Tree fragrance almost smells like kerosene to me personally but if you dilute the soap with water than its tolerable. For those that love the Tea Tree essence, this is the product for you!</li>
    <li> This is a great soap...I love all the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soaps...Tea Tree is a fav!!</li>
    <li> Love this soap, use it for everything.</li>
    <li> Great for acne skin. I&#x27;ve always been using 1 year ago. That&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Cleared up acne on my back and face. I use this daily instead of my normal body wash and I am hooked. Great for athletes foot too! Lasts a long time and lathers nicely.</li>
    <li> I love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps. I use them for everything!</li>
    <li> It leaves the skin clean but it lacks the nice fragrance as the bar soap.</li>
    <li> good bang for the buck ! love that soap</li>
    <li> I usually buy the Lavender scent but I gave this scent a try.I like the lav better but this is fine also.It has a very strong herbal smell and is great for multi purpose cleaning.I love it in the shower it makes me feel very clean and has natural antiseptic properties.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve used Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap for some time. It&#x27;s great stuff. No funky film feeling on your skin. This scent is great and so is the peppermint,</li>
    <li> i like all their soaps they all smell great</li>
    <li> I love the Dr. bronner&#x27;s products</li>
    <li> I use Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap for everything.</li>
    <li> Great soap, has a very earthy scent but I like it</li>
    <li> I have dry skin that often gets much worse shortly after a shower.  I tried switching to other body washes and away from bar soap and that helped some.  I was pretty happy that things had improved.  I got this for my wife to help with athlete&#x27;s foot issues and decided to give it a try myself.  I was blown away with how well it worked.  My wife commented that she liked the way I smell after showering with it, it completely got rid of my dry skin problem, and I don&#x27;t get a rash anywhere from any kind of chemicals in it.  (I&#x27;m allergic to scented soaps and just about anything with chemical scenting in it.)</li>
    <li> I use this soap for myself and bathing my dogs. A little bit goes a long way. You can never go wrong with Dr Bronner.</li>
    <li> works well. smells really good</li>
    <li> I have used these products before love them. Thanks</li>
    <li> Love this soap! It smells SO good and is gentle enough for the whole family!</li>
    <li> I have given up bar soap!  This is the best; leaves me clean and skin not dry.  I use a dispenser that takes 1 part liquid soap to 5 parts water and puts out foam.  The huge bottle will last me forever at this rate.  So, I got the peppermint version as sell....so refreshing.</li>
    <li> Tea tree oil is great for cleaning. Good product, good price. Why four stars? The label. They tried to squeeze the entire flipping bible onto the label and forgot... You know, the INSTRUCTIONS. Sample of instructions when you do find them &amp;#34;get wet, apply soap, washcloth or loofah&amp;#34; yeah 18 in 1 uses, but they don&#x27;t tell you what they are!</li>
    <li> This is great stuff.  The political gibberish nonsense printed all over the bottle shouldn&#x27;t dissuade you from buying it.</li>
    <li> It sells like terpentine. Not at all what I expected it to smell like.</li>
    <li> best stuff I&#x27;ve ever bought! there&#x27;s nothing  this stuff cannot do. love it</li>
    <li> Such a refreshing feeling with this soap, skin feels soft and clean.  It is especially helpful if you suffer with body acne, it helps clear it up.</li>
    <li> I just love this.  It makes me feel clean all over.  A great shower addition.  A great product for anyone..</li>
    <li> Really good soap. Kinda makes your skin &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34;. I wouldn&#x27;t use to much of it personally.</li>
    <li> Love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products.  Only product that really makes my face feel and look clean.</li>
    <li> Has good aroma.  Removes oil from skin and is refreshing.  I would recommend this product for anyone with oily skin.</li>
    <li> I have very oily skin. I&#x27;m very prone to acne and cysts as well.  With most soap, if I go even 12 hours without showering, I just start to feel dirty and uncomfortable, like I need another shower. This soap gives me a level of cleanliness that no soap I&#x27;ve ever used before comes even close to matching. I&#x27;m a fairly athletic person, so I tend to sweat a lot, and end up with acne all over my back and chest. Ever since I started using this soap, I&#x27;ve been acne free on my back and chest. It&#x27;s also helped to keep some of my recurring cysts from flaring up. It also eliminates all the body odor I have after working out. The smell of this soap takes some getting used to at first (the smell is the tea tree oil, I think), but luckily after you rinse off, the smell of the soap goes with it - so don&#x27;t worry about smelling like this soap. This soap is also fairly economical. One bottle lasts for a very long time - a few drops of this stuff go a long way.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for washing my very dry hair. I don&#x27;t like the smell, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement yet, but when my dog rolled in something long dead and VERY smelly, it took the smell right out, and his coat was very shiny afterwards.</li>
    <li> Mmmmmm love all these products. Great for a stinky girl!</li>
