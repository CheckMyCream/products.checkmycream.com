<li> it has a very masculine smell, and seems to last a few hours.</li>
<li> other is white &amp;#34;my favorite&amp;#34; and say Antiperspirant &amp; smells stronger in my opinion</li>
<li> &lt;br /&gt;One is blue in color and smells a little lighter, and does not say ANTIPERSPIRANT</li>
<li> The product was as advertised and came as expected.</li>
<li> but I am really not a fan of the scent</li>
<li> I checked them all because the ones I&#x27;ve been buying at retail stores usually are ,1, used a bit, 2 , broken spray top, never sure what you&#x27;re going go get.</li>
<li> Reasonable but not great value.  </li>
<li> Forget about any other brand or any other scents, this Anarchy is #1</li>
<li> The products do complement each other which is the way it should be.</li>
<li> if this is not available, than I recommend Axe Essense.</li>
<li> What a waste of $25.</li>
<li> I like it because I don&#x27;t have to search the store for the few cans of this scent.  </li>
<li> I receive the wrong thing for the 2nd time</li>
<li> False advertising.</li>
<li> At least they don&#x27;t say I smell badly!  </li>
<li> I ordered a 6-pack because the deodorant version is nearly impossible to find.</li>

    <li> My husband loves this stuff!</li>
    <li> Love the product. Smells good and last for a long time! I don&#x27;t use it every day.</li>
    <li> Reasonable but not great value.  I like it because I don&#x27;t have to search the store for the few cans of this scent.  Axe constantly changes scents and I find that I dislike many of the new ones.</li>
    <li> Very strong smelling and makes my eyes water and I cough. If you have allergies or asthma, this is a strong smelling spray and I would not recommend it. It smells good once the smell wears off after a while.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK; I use it once in a while for variety. it has a very masculine smell, and seems to last a few hours. Not a WoW-er though.</li>
    <li> Smells masculine but not too much so and a fantastic deal when you have prime and shipping is free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a compliment on how I smelled from a female coworker who actually prefers people of her own sex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s a win in my book.</li>
    <li> This listing shows an image of Axe DEODORANT Bodyspray. I ordered a 6-pack because the deodorant version is nearly impossible to find. However, my package arrived today, and it is NOT deodorant. It is just Bodyspray. And, Amazon won&#x27;t let me return it because it&#x27;s &amp;#34;hazardous&amp;#34;. What a waste of $25. False advertising.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and seems ok but I am really not a fan of the scent, I don&#x27;t think I will buy again</li>
    <li> Excelent fragrance, it&#x27;s unique, I am always going to buy this one while I am&lt;br /&gt;In the us!! See you</li>
    <li> I like the scent of the Anarchy body wash which I used before the deordorant, but when I used a different deordorant I ended up wearing a collage of aromas.  Then I discovered that Axe also made a deordorant in the Anarchy scent which solved the problem.  I know use both and I have had several compliments as the aroma isn&#x27;t overpowering after the first couple of minutes unlike some other products I have tried.  The products do complement each other which is the way it should be.</li>
    <li> Great scent and price, ships fast and sealed. All cans work great. I checked them all because the ones I&#x27;ve been buying at retail stores usually are ,1, used a bit, 2 , broken spray top, never sure what you&#x27;re going go get. I&#x27;ve purchased this 6 pak twice and the 3 pak of Excite twice and all 12 cans were perfect. Will be a repeat purchase from now on.  Cliff R.  CA.</li>
    <li> I clicked to purchase the daily Fragrance but I keep getting the deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;And I receive the wrong thing for the 2nd time</li>
    <li> This Axe product is the best on the market !!! I&#x27;ve received many compliments from it. Initially, I didn&#x27;t want to review it because I did not want to encourage others to buy it, just so Amazon would always be in stock lol but the truth is, this is absolutely incredible ! if this is not available, than I recommend Axe Essense. Forget about any other brand or any other scents, this Anarchy is #1 and Essense is #2 and you would be extremely happy by following my recommendation !</li>
    <li> this is the only company my husband has worn in 5 years. healways smells fresh!</li>
    <li> AXE me a question.  Does this product work?  OF COURSE.  Great price, speedy delivery.</li>
    <li> Fast ship good price would recommend thx</li>
    <li> People at work frequently mention that I smell good.  At least they don&#x27;t say I smell badly!  Also nice to buy a 6 pack for what I would get 2/2.5 can at the local store.</li>
    <li> This 6 pack at the price it is sold at comes to about $2.60 a can. Go to CVS and pay $5.49 a can or 25% off with there coupon. This is a Super buy for 4 oz. spray.</li>
    <li> My wife asked why the bathroom smelled like a girl after I sprayed it on the first time.  Now I have 6 bottles to use.  Maybe I&#x27;ll use it for air fresher after using the bathroom...</li>
    <li> excellent product, product as stated - excellent service! A+</li>
    <li> Oof, I certainly hope that by using Axe&#x27;s Anarchy flavored bodyspray, I don&#x27;t end up thinking odd political thoughts.  Maybe I shouldn&#x27;t have written that, cuz you KNOW who reads everything dontcha?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway...the Anarchy smells great and I get some nice comments about it.  Erm...i&#x27;m talking about the spray, not the...Oh never mind!</li>
    <li> Spray users read this if you buy there deodorant as well.....&lt;br /&gt;I personally love the smell of the Anarchy, I think its AXE&#x27;S best deodorant but there are 2 types by the same name so after calling AXE and having it explained to me, here is the difference&lt;br /&gt;One is blue in color and smells a little lighter, and does not say ANTIPERSPIRANT&lt;br /&gt;the other is white &amp;#34;my favorite&amp;#34; and say Antiperspirant &amp; smells stronger in my opinion&lt;br /&gt;Both types are Anarchy&lt;br /&gt;By the way, if you have the time call the customer service number on the bottle and have them explain it or any other questions, they will send a free coupon for a free product up to a $6 dollar value, I used my right away!!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks AXE&lt;br /&gt;Love the Anarchy</li>
    <li> I happen to really like this Axe body spray scent. Got it for a steal! My order was processed and shipped right away. The product was as advertised and came as expected. What more could a person want?</li>
    <li> Shipping was a bit delayed but otherwise I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
