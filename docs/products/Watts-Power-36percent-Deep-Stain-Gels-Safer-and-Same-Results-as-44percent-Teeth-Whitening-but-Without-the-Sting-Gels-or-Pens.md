      <li>This stuff is wonderful.</li>
      <li>Works wonderfully!!</li>
      <li>Excellent.</li>
      <li>I am really impressed with this product.</li>
      <li>Great thank you wonderful seller</li>
      <li>Awesome product and great price.</li>
      <li>Great product, great price!</li>
      <li>Also I&#x27;ve experienced almost no sensitivity at all.</li>
      <li>Amazing!</li>
      <li>This is my go to product for whitening my teeth effectively!</li>
      <li>I gave it a fair chance with both syringes.</li>
      <li>but this is SO much better!</li>
      <li>It worked beautifully, great results the very first application!</li>
      <li>Definitely a worthwhile product! :)</li>
      <li>anything more will squish out of the tray when you put it in.</li>
      <li>and so glad I checked on here for comparable product.</li>
      <li>Thank you :)</li>
      <li>I bought the 36% orange mint flavor only because it had the best price at the time and the taste is fine.</li>
      <li>Watts Power Professional whitening gel works as well as all the gel syringes I have bought from my dentist at a great savings in cost.  </li>
      <li>At 36% it&#x27;s almost twice as strong as what dentists use.</li>
      <li>its so strong.</li>
      <li>The syringe is large so there will many more uses from Watts.  </li>
      <li>I was excited about receiving this product.</li>
      <li>This whitening gel did a very good job of whitening, but you need to be careful and understand how powerful it is.</li>
      <li>I bought this after reading a few good reviews but I can honestly say it did nothing for me...</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s many positive reviews.</li>
      <li>but I didn&#x27;t expect anything special from the product for that price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>After using it for about a week I began receiving compliments on how white and bright my smile was.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re not stunningly white yet but they&#x27;re a nice even light cream color.</li>
      <li>I have used far better products.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s effective and low cost!</li>
      <li>Definitely recommend this to anyone looking for an inexpensive and quick way to brighten up their smile!</li>
      <li>I was also excited about the flavor &amp;#34;orange mint&amp;#34; because lets face it, whitening gel in general is pretty nasty.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>First of all, I ordered the Orange Mint flavor, mostly because it was cheapest, but also because I&#x27;m not opposed to any flavor other than the \\&quot;whitening gel\\&quot; taste.  </li>
      <li>I still have a huge amount of gel left</li>
      <li>It works very well at whitening.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s works very well</li>
      <li>You also don&#x27;t want to swallow, since so much of the gel ends up foaming onto your tongue, so you have to repeatedly go to the sink to spit some out.</li>
      <li>and there&#x27;s a very noticeable difference already.</li>
      <li>If you get too much on your gums it makes them very sensitive but does nothing to whiten.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product-</li>
      <li>I left the gel on, using a dental tray, for 30 minutes each time and really didn&#x27;t get much in the way of any results.</li>
      <li>Absolutely recommend this product for its low price and effectiveness.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive teeth, but this doesn&#x27;t cause any tooth sensitivity.</li>
      <li>am sure the product will work well, as it is infused with enough chemicals to kill a small animal.</li>
      <li>You can barely tell they tried giving it an orange mint flavor</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only done about 5 or 6 treatments so far of 1 hour each</li>
      <li>so be sure to use only half a drop or less per tooth,</li>
      <li>The results have been exactly the same as other products I have used.  </li>
      <li>My dentist sells 16% and 22% carbamide peroxide whitening gel, exactly the same ingredient as this product (36% orange mint), for $45 for a lot less product</li>
      <li>sometimes I felt pain only during few first days of usage, then pain went away.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
      <li>The gel really has vey little effect on the color of my teeth and there is no way that there are 80 applications.</li>
      <li>I also experienced painful sensitivity from using this gel, which I wouldn&#x27;t have minded if I&#x27;d seen results, but for what I got, this product was a complete waste of money, even if it is a cheaper whitening option.</li>

<li> other products (strips, other gels)</li>
<li> I was expecting to see some results after a few days, but after 2 weeks of using this product for an hour a day, I saw absolutely NO  whitening results, other than a slight polishing effect.  </li>
<li> I decided to buy this product to whiten my teeth a few shades.  </li>
<li> I decided to paint on the product to reduce waste and gum irritation.</li>
<li> A waste of money.</li>
<li> but they went away in a few days..</li>

<li> A little hard to keep in your mouth for the time it tells you too -</li>
<li> pushed a small bead of gel into my trays and waited.  </li>
<li> put 3* to the product because I&#x27;m not sure if it does the job.&lt;br</li>
<li> This product is a stronger solution and less expensive.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t have any bad stains, my teeth just aren&#x27;t as white as they used to be.  </li>
<li> but it&#x27;s not good at all.</li>
<li> I put a thin strip in each tray and wipe off the \\&quot;overflow\\&quot; with a q-tip.  </li>
<li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the taste, which isn&#x27;t horrible</li>
<li> I may attempt it again using a brush to spread a very thin layer of gel over my trays.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> Sometimes I do get the zingy teeth sensation after using it but its nothing bad.</li>
<li> disappointed me is that i felt pain in the teeth during all days.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
<li> And the price is insane.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have started to notice a difference and the bleach does as its suppose to...whiten teeth. Sometimes I do get the zingy teeth sensation after using it but its nothing bad. I leave the trays in for an hour and sometimes I go longer without any troubles.  I bought the 36% orange mint flavor only because it had the best price at the time and the taste is fine. The syringes will last a long time, the two I bought should last me around 2 months and thats using it every day. A little goes a long way so be sure to use only half a drop or less per tooth, anything more will squish out of the tray when you put it in.</li>
    <li> The gel really has vey little effect on the color of my teeth and there is no way that there are 80 applications. I beleive that I remember reading that in the instructions or the product description some where.&lt;br /&gt;I got maybe 3 1/2 out of each \\&quot;vial&#x27;. I left the gel on, using a dental tray, for 30 minutes each time and really didn&#x27;t get much in the way of any results.</li>
    <li> Watts Power Professional whitening gel works as well as all the gel syringes I have bought from my dentist at a great savings in cost.  I purchased the 36% strength which I have used before from my dentist.  The results have been exactly the same as other products I have used.  The syringe is large so there will many more uses from Watts.  Another plus with this product is that it is supposedly made in USA vs other dentist brands which come from Europe.</li>
    <li> A little hard to keep in your mouth for the time it tells you too - but, if you can, it works!</li>
    <li> This whitening gel did a very good job of whitening, but you need to be careful and understand how powerful it is. At 36% it&#x27;s almost twice as strong as what dentists use.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical of this product and only got it for it&#x27;s many positive reviews. Ordered the tray and used this for a week before I saw an actual difference in the color of my teeth. Amazing! Plus, I was about to shell out $200+ at my dentist&#x27;s office and so glad I checked on here for comparable product. Definitely recommend this to anyone looking for an inexpensive and quick way to brighten up their smile!</li>
    <li> I am really impressed with this product. My dentist sells 16% and 22% carbamide peroxide whitening gel, exactly the same ingredient as this product (36% orange mint), for $45 for a lot less product (I think they said 9 treatments, 3 3ml tubes). I&#x27;ve only done about 5 or 6 treatments so far of 1 hour each and there&#x27;s a very noticeable difference already. My teeth no longer have any yellow about them at all. They&#x27;re not stunningly white yet but they&#x27;re a nice even light cream color. Also I&#x27;ve experienced almost no sensitivity at all. After 2 nights of an hour each in a row there is just a tiny bit of sensitivity when I brush but it&#x27;s not even painful, just a bit more sensitive, so I&#x27;ve decided to do a treatment or two a week until I reach the shade I want. And the price is insane. I still have a huge amount of gel left so I know this will last me months. Excellent. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the taste, which isn&#x27;t horrible but it&#x27;s not good at all. It&#x27;s bearable. You can barely tell they tried giving it an orange mint flavor so I wouldn&#x27;t be too concerned about which flavor you choose.</li>
    <li> Great thank you wonderful seller</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading a few good reviews but I can honestly say it did nothing for me... If you get too much on your gums it makes them very sensitive but does nothing to whiten. I gave it a fair chance with both syringes. I don&#x27;t smoke or drink coffee so my teeth are not very yellow but this made no difference. A waste of money. I have used far better products.</li>
    <li> I have used this before...this one is stronger.  It works very well at whitening.  I put a thin strip in each tray and wipe off the \\&quot;overflow\\&quot; with a q-tip.  If you don&#x27;t wipe off the excess, you may be sore. I have sensitive teeth, but this doesn&#x27;t cause any tooth sensitivity.I highly recommend this product-it&#x27;s effective and low cost!</li>
    <li> It caused some sensitivity while in use. However, it did not whiten my teeth noticeably. I will give it another try &amp; update my review.</li>
    <li> This is my go to product for whitening my teeth effectively! It gives me the results I used to get with my dentist, but that got too costly. Awesome product and great price. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I was excited about receiving this product. Everything shipped on time and 1 syringe has about 3 times the amount of gel as one syringe from the dentist office. I was also excited about the flavor &amp;#34;orange mint&amp;#34; because lets face it, whitening gel in general is pretty nasty.&lt;br /&gt;I pushed a small bead of gel into my trays and waited.  About 5 minutes later, I noticed I was over-foaming. I tried spitting some of it out, but was no use.  I was like I had just drank bleach! I removed the trays, spit out any excess and brushed my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I have used Nite White for over 10 years now, and I&#x27;ve never had this problem.&lt;br /&gt;However, I may attempt it again using a brush to spread a very thin layer of gel over my trays.&lt;br /&gt;I am sure the product will work well, as it is infused with enough chemicals to kill a small animal.</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful. Can&#x27;t believe how much whiter it makes your teeth and in only a few treatments. We had been using the strips for ever and it sort of helped but this is SO much better!</li>
    <li> the bottom line here is this gel works! If you get it on your gums it BURNS bc its so strong. But it will give you results</li>
    <li> I decided to buy this product to whiten my teeth a few shades.  I don&#x27;t have any bad stains, my teeth just aren&#x27;t as white as they used to be.  I&#x27;ve used Crest White Strips in the past with wonderful results, but horrible pain and sensitivity.  I thought I&#x27;d try Watt&#x27;s 36% Whitening Gel to hopefully whiten my teeth in less time than White Strips and possibly with less sensitivity.  First of all, I ordered the Orange Mint flavor, mostly because it was cheapest, but also because I&#x27;m not opposed to any flavor other than the \\&quot;whitening gel\\&quot; taste.  This product tasted NOTHING like Orange or Mint.  It was just a standard whitening flavor.  Secondly, this whitening gel foams up so much in your mouth that it&#x27;s extremely difficult to keep it off your gums (mine were burned a few times from this happening).  You also don&#x27;t want to swallow, since so much of the gel ends up foaming onto your tongue, so you have to repeatedly go to the sink to spit some out. I used this product with whitening trays, but that didn&#x27;t seem to help the gel stay on my teeth.  Lastly, this product simply DID NOT WORK.  I was expecting to see some results after a few days, but after 2 weeks of using this product for an hour a day, I saw absolutely NO  whitening results, other than a slight polishing effect.  I also experienced painful sensitivity from using this gel, which I wouldn&#x27;t have minded if I&#x27;d seen results, but for what I got, this product was a complete waste of money, even if it is a cheaper whitening option.</li>
    <li> Everything arrived as it&#x27;s been scheduled.&lt;br /&gt;I put 3* to the product because I&#x27;m not sure if it does the job.&lt;br /&gt;Probably yes. The teeth became whiter I think. Not radically but I didn&#x27;t expect anything special from the product for that price.&lt;br /&gt;I just wanted to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;What disappointed me is that i felt pain in the teeth during all days.&lt;br /&gt;In other products (strips, other gels) sometimes I felt pain only during few first days of usage, then pain went away.&lt;br /&gt;In that product I felt pain during all days I used the product.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes during evenings, day or night (even I used the product in the morning).&lt;br /&gt;So. My advice is that if you can&#x27;t stand the tooth pain that product isn&#x27;t for you</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully!! Absolutely recommend this product for its low price and effectiveness. After using it for about a week I began receiving compliments on how white and bright my smile was. Definitely a worthwhile product! :)</li>
    <li> Great product, great price! I decided to paint on the product to reduce waste and gum irritation. It worked beautifully, great results the very first application! Will definitely be recommending and repurchasing! Thank you :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always purchased my gel from my dentist. This product is a stronger solution and less expensive. It&#x27;s works very well and I will continue to order from here in the future!</li>
    <li> This whitening gel works..made my teeth whiter immediately..but holy moly it hurt my gums and mouth tissue..after using I had bleeding gums and cancer sores...but they went away in a few days..so I will use only sparingly!</li>
