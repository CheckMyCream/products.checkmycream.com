<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this stuff and go through a ton of it due to my hobby of nail art.  I finally broke down and bought it in bulk so I didn&#x27;t have to keep going to Sally&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> This product works extremely well and lasts a very long time. I constantly paint my nails, every 3 or 4 days, usually. This product is easy to remove with nail polish remover. However, it will last a long time as well. I love it.</li>
    <li> Thank you. It is perfect and the price was right!!</li>
    <li> very good top coat, i use it every time. this is a good deal because its like 6 bucks per bottle usually and this has enough for 8 bottles</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough about how great Seche Vite is.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years and my manicurist agrees that it&#x27;s the best fast drying topcoat she&#x27;s used.  The price for this set is hard to beat, if you can even find it at a retail store.</li>
    <li> This nail polish is not the fastest-drying I have ever used but it does dry quickly (less than 5 minutes) and it IS the shiniest top coat I have ever seen.  And it lasts a long time!  What more could a girl ask for??</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY product that will keep polish on my nails for any length of time. Even gel/shellac polish comes right off my nails in two days. This lasts about a week for me on my fingernails and two weeks on my toenails, which are complete miracles. I love this product! Great price, too.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I do a lot of nail art and it is amazing.  The shine is fantastic and some polishes (Essie in particular) leave bubbles.  This product completely melts the polish with it and smooths out blebs and bubbles.  Make sure you paint it a little under the tip of your nail to help with the &amp;#34;shrinkage&amp;#34; issue some people complain about.  I will not even paint my nails if I don&#x27;t have this top coat.  Drying time is also fantastic which is what led me to purchase it in the first place.</li>
    <li> I usually spend about $6 on a .5 oz bottle of Seche Vite. This set comes with a full bottle of .5 oz Seche Vite and 8 refills in the large glass refill bottle. It comes with a small funnel to keep the mess to a minimum when refilling. This set would have cost me $54 if I were purchasing each bottle separately. This refill kit will last you for several months if you use it on average of 2-3 times per week like I do. You can&#x27;t go wrong with buying this set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seche is my favorite top coat out of all the top coats I have tried. It is strong, smooth (self leveling) and very shiny and extremely fast drying. Some complain that it \\&quot;shrinks\\&quot; your nail artwork but I have never had a problem with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest complaint that I (and many other users) have is that by the time you get half way through the bottle, it starts to thicken because of the evaporation of some of the ingredients. Seche Vite has a polish thinner (Seche Restore Polish)in their line of products (cost of around $5 on Amazon) that takes care of the problem so that you don&#x27;t have to waste the last 1/2 of the bottle. Just a few drops of the thinner and you are good.</li>
    <li> dries fast, very good item to have for nails. def recommend buying this, its a steal!!</li>
    <li> I will never do my nails without using this for the rest of my life. Such a time saver! It smells a bit but it dissipates quickly. This was a great value as well.</li>
    <li> The best top coat ever.  We always use this.</li>
    <li> This is magical. Super high gloss and the best part...it makes your polish dries so quickly and sets without imperfections. Life time user.</li>
    <li> This is the very best top coat I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve tried quite a few. However, in teeny tiny writing on the bottle (which I typically don&#x27;t read), it says that the product &amp;#34;contains ingredients known to the state of California to cause birth defects or other reproductive harm.&amp;#34; Not worth it!!!</li>
    <li> Item accurately described; fast shipment; Great Seller!  Thank You!!</li>
    <li> I get sick of going to the store where I buy the little bottles of this polish.  And, it&#x27;s more expensive there.  I haven&#x27;t had to fill my bottle yet, but, I know I will LOVE not going to the store everytime I need a new bottle.</li>
    <li> There is no better product!!!!  This is THE fastest drying and toughest product on the market for the best value.  Thank god they have an industrial sized refill option!!!</li>
    <li> seche vite is hands down the best top coat out there. I have tried 500 different ones because my nails seem to chip after day 1 of a manicure. this keeps the manicure lasting long and so glossy! when I get my toes done and pass on a manicure, they think its bc I have gels! nope its just seche vite :)</li>
    <li> Seche Vite top coat is the best.  When I ran out recently, the speed of my manicures went noticably downhill...which means I totally screwed up my nails every damn time.  So I bought this pack so I didn&#x27;t have to keep buying bottles of it.  It comes with a little funnel for easy refills and is basically exactly as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve never used seche vite top coat before, its awesome, but be aware that it tends to get gloopy.  I highly recommend buying some Seche Restore with it to thin it out as it has problems.  I would not have been as happy with it if I did not do that.</li>
    <li> This top coat is the only one I&#x27;ll use. It&#x27;s great stuff! I love this refill because you get a better value than buying a lot of the little bottles. My only dislike is that it comes in a glass bottle which makes it take FOREVER to dispense into the little bottles. But, it&#x27;s a great product. I got it relatively fast and in great, protective packaging. I&#x27;d recommend getting the nail polish thinner too because this particular brand can get thick fast. Every time I fill up a little bottle I&#x27;ll put a few drops of thinner in it and it keeps it nice and thin.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Feels great to refill bottles I already have. I&#x27;ll Will bet this will save me lots of money!</li>
    <li> I purchased a regular sized bottle of this at a local store. It&#x27;s the best fast dry top coat I have EVER used and I refuse to be without it anymore. It&#x27;s simply incredible. My nails are do-your-hair dry in less than 90 seconds. I tried this, and I tried Out the Door. OTD would sometimes leave weird cloudy spots over dark colors, and I really didn&#x27;t like that, and it did not dry as fast. Seche Vite is fast, crystal clear, leaves nails with a wet gloss look, and did I mention FAST? I always use with the Seche Clear basecoat, it seems to work best that way. It is a top coat that needs to be &amp;#34;floated&amp;#34; on to wet polish. I don&#x27;t know a better way to explain it, but you need to have a heavier bead of it on the brush than you would normally use, this will avoid streaking the polish underneath. Don&#x27;t wait for the polish to dry either. I find that as long as I apply while polish is wet, and float on a good thick coat of this, I don&#x27;t have any streaking or pulling, and the polish doesn&#x27;t transfer to the brush/bottle. It DOES tend to thicken over time, this can be fixed with a few drops of Seche Restore. Purchasing this size saved me a fortune, as I paid just a couple of dollars more than the price of the small bottle at the store, and got the equivalent of 9 bottles.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Seche Vite! It smooths out my polish, is ultra glossy, and dries nails faster than any other top coat I&#x27;ve used. I use a coat of this every single time I paint my nails! Seriously, finding Seche Vite changed the nail game for me! I found that about half way through the .5 oz bottle, it does tend to thicken, but its nothing a little nail polish thinner can&#x27;t help. And this set is a huge bargain, especially if you paint your nails as often as I do!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product.  I have been doing my own nails since I was12 or 13 years old, and was often frustrated with the time it took for Polish to dry; this product dries the polish in about one minute, flat.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Okay guys! I&#x27;ve been on a mission trying to find a quick dry topcoat that not only keeps the nails looking shiny but lasts a long time. I am what you call a &amp;#34;nail enthusiast&amp;#34; &amp; I should&#x27;ve been a nail tech as a side job. People do come to me to have their nails done all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;ve always asked everyone I&#x27;ve known for the best topcoat around. See, my problem is, I have found quick dry nail topcoats, but after they dry they dull the color somewhat. Are you all having that problem? Well not only does this keep the shine lasting forever! But this is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used! HANDS DOWN!!! (no pun intended.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every layer of your polish will dry FAST, won&#x27;t scratch up hours later, has a nice gel-like finish; if you ask me. And the reason I don&#x27;t do gel is because I change my polish so often. You guys HAVE to try this! And oh yeah, the professional sized kit, what a bargain!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff...dries my nails in less than 5 min. Doesn&#x27;t smear nail art.</li>
    <li> The polish addict in me goes though Seche Vite Top Coat super fast, and this large set was great considering it&#x27;s super cost effective to purchase in the larger container. I will definitely be purchasing it again when I run out!</li>
    <li> Works well for me. I apply as a finishing coat. I do like the shiny finish</li>
    <li> Very good, I&#x27;m so happy to receive on time.thanks</li>
    <li> The reviews were so good for this and the product is not good for me. Whenever I apply this coat, the nail polish peels away hours later. It literally peels away!</li>
    <li> i really love this product, it does exactly what was advertised, smooth finish and brilliant shine, and  really fast drying. thanks again.</li>
    <li> This is the best top coat I have ever tried. It dries fast its thick and heavy duty. Only thing is you need to purchase the thinner as it will keep thickening over time.. Also the refill is hard to get out of the bottle into the smaller bottle because its thick and barely fits through the plastic pouring piece they give. If the big bottle was squeezable it would pour more easily. Other than that good product.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with this purchase. I got these 4 months ago and I am not even one fifth of the way through the 4 ounce bottle. For a little perspective, I polish my nails at least twice each week. I also regularly paint my mom and grandma&#x27;s nails. I read a lot of good reviews on this product before I purchased it. I was a little wary to buy so much the first time trying Seche Vite but the price was so much better this way that I decided to do it. this top coat is supposed to be pretty thick and glossy. Sometimes, it starts to get a little too thick for my taste so I just put a little bit of polish thinner in it and that straightens it right out. When I use this product, my nails continue to look shiny and pretty until I decide to take my polish off. I love that it dries so quickly and that it is supposed to be applied to wet polish. I save so much time by using this.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, this stuff!!!! Dries polish quick and to a nice shine! This refill saves money! THANKS SO MUCH!!!!</li>
    <li> you have to get this. So good for your nails and makes everything look complete. Worth the money every time.</li>
    <li> There was no plastic pour cap</li>
    <li> Suuuuch a good bargain for suuuuuch a good product.</li>
    <li> Fast shipment. Easy Purchase!</li>
    <li> good product at terrific price</li>
    <li> I have been using Seche Vite for at least give years and this package will probably last me another five.  Quick delivery &amp; no problems!!!</li>
    <li> This Seche Vite product, coupled with an OPI nail polish, gives me, easily, a full 10-days manicure. Even then, I wouldn&#x27;t have to re-do my nails, except for my nails growing so fast when using it. Then the bare nail with no polish, back at the nail bed, makes them look rather tacky, in spite of the tips still being covered after 10 days - no chipping, cracking, or peeling back. This product is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I do my manicures using the complete professional method, and using only professional pdts; it used to take me a good 1 to 1-1/2 hours to do a complete manicure, b/c of the long-drying time, plus getting a few smudges during that amt of time. But this gives me a hard, dry nail in only 5 min or so. Really! So I can do a full, complete manicure in 25-30 minutes now. I no longer dread doing a manicure, and I used to hate it so badly that, half the time, I ended up going to a manicurist. Still do for pedicures, but I now &#x27;enjoy&#x27; doing my manicures. Nuff said??</li>
    <li> Seche Vite is the best high shine, quick dry topcoat I have used. I almost always boogered up my polish before it was dry until I started using this topcoat. Use with the Seche Restore to keep it from getting too thick and this large bottle will last a LONG TIME, at a really reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I love SV and have been using it for a while now. I was excited to see the refill bottle and decided to order it, since I paint my nails often. This is runny, does not dry quickly and my nails are getting ruined awhile after painting them! WASTE OF MONEY!</li>
    <li> This stuff is AWESOME!!!  Dries polish really fast so you can get on with your day!  I love it! 👍👍👍👍👍</li>
    <li> I swear by my seche vite. I paint my nails about every other night, and I don&#x27;t have time to sit around and wait for them to dry. SV makes them hard and dry in mere minutes - allowing me to go about my night. It works JUST as advertized.</li>
    <li> This too coat dries all the way down to the Base coat in less  than a minute I am so pleased</li>
    <li> This is a major steal! With seche it is hit or miss with people. You either love it or hate it. I stopped using it due to price and noticed a major decline in my nails. Bought this and have no regrets!</li>
    <li> I think the product works really well and I&#x27;m happy with it. It does take forever to refill because of the glass bottle.</li>
    <li> I am impressed with this product. I highly recommend Seche Vite-Top Coat. I will be purchasing the Base Coat to give it a try.</li>
    <li> great!! I use it all the time!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product as usual. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Seche Vite is life changing! That may sound ridiculous since it&#x27;s just a top coat, and not a miracle drug or religious experience, but... If you&#x27;re sick of smudging your freshly painted nails even when you give them plenty of time to dry, you will be amazed. With this top coat, your nails are dry to the touch in about 90 seconds, and completely dry in 5 minutes. It will also make your manicure super glossy and will make it last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re never used a fast dry topcoat like this one, you&#x27;re in for a treat. Just keep in mind that it is best applied over wet or slightly tacky polish, and you should wrap the tips of your nails for best results because there is a certain amount of shrinkage. Also, it does have a tendency to get quite thick in the bottle and you might want to buy Seche Restore or another polish thinner to get the most out of it long term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI, you should be able to pick this up at Sally Beauty, Target, or Ulta but per ounce this is a very good deal.</li>
    <li> I cant live without Seche Vite to dry each coat of nail polish. It dries fast and keeps my nail time down to an hour unlike the hours it would take without this product. I am in love.</li>
    <li> Great deal awesome product!</li>
    <li> I like it excellent delivery. More convenient to use and I would like to suggest my friends and relatives to buy.</li>
    <li> A lot of product for a good price. Top coat dries very quickly. Does cause slight shrinkage of nail polish underneath it. Has a strong odor and should be used in a well vented space.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this top coat for over 15 years when my nail tech told me about it.  I won&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
    <li> bottle was shipped and received within days, and i&#x27;ll never be using another top coat! dries super quickly and cleanly, without messing up the nail art under it. great stuff!</li>
    <li> This is a great set, the bottle of replacement is bigger than it looks in the picture and lasts a long time.  The funnel, however, is useless - the product just sits in it and doesn&#x27;t flow to the bottom. I recommend just carefully pouring in the replacement top coat and quickly wiping up any mess.  Other than that, no complaints.</li>
    <li> I placed this order on a Sunday and received it on Thursday. The bottles were in a cardboard box and shipped in a padded envelope.  Good value for the price!  Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This top coat is awesome it dries fast! And gives you a nice glossy shine on your nails. I will definitely buy this product again. Especially for this price!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re a very impatient manicurist, as I am, these are a &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34;.  It&#x27;s easily the best top coat I&#x27;ve ever used as it dries and sets the polish in literally like 30 seconds.  I&#x27;ve highly recommended this product to others and will never be without it in my nail polish case!</li>
    <li> I am a nail polish lover and I do my own nails once/twice a week and this is and has been my top coat of choice since I started caring for my own natural nails two years ago; and I do buy the large refill size, its more cost effective, can&#x27;t do without this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now sometimes I do notice that it peals, I take care of this &amp;#34;pealing&amp;#34; by adding a drop or two of SV Restore or any nail polish thinner and the pealing stops also this product does tend to get think after a little while so having nail polish thinner is a must to thin it out again.  But even having to add the polish thinner occasionally, this product is fast drying, its super shiny and I love and recommend it!</li>
    <li> Best ever, I use so much of this I have I buy it in the big bottle. This is the only top coat I use!!</li>
    <li> Quick delivery. Awesome product.</li>
    <li> Best top coat EVER!  I love the shiny look of gel nails but my nails grow too fast to make it worth the investment and I HATE trying to get the gel off -takes way to long.  Seche Vite gives me the shine of gel nails and the wear as well, but comes off with remover like regular nail polish.  It&#x27;s very thick, goes on easy, and make my polish last much longer than usual.  GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this top coat! Dries literally within seconds &amp; it&#x27;s a glossy finish, any nail polish looks almost like a gel polish with this top coat</li>
    <li> Best top coat ever!!!!</li>
    <li> This cant be the real product. It peels and flakes off as soon as its dry. Although it is in a Seche Vite bottle, its NOT the same quality as what I have purchased at a retail store.</li>
    <li> Extreme value,  best top coat out there.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I can finally paint my nails without the desire to remove them shortly after. Applies on smooth, dries quickly and all the way through! Great product at both a generous amount and cost.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a novice nail art art enthusiast and expert junkie. I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without Seche Vite--it&#x27;s my nail ish. I always wrap my tips, but occasionally Seche shrinks my polish coats and the edges pull away from the cuticle. Also, be forewarned if you&#x27;re using Seche over a foil that&#x27;s been paired with a foil-friendly topcoat...there are times when the Seche will power through and wrinkle your foil, but I digress. Where would I be without this wonder product? It dries super fast, leaves my nails looking glossy and flawless and holds tight for up to a week--I&#x27;m a mom of three so that&#x27;s no easy task.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I love painting my nails now. I put this over my 2 coats of polish and I&#x27;m ready to go in minutes! No smudging either! Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. My nails were dry within a minute or so. It also helped my manicure last longer.</li>
    <li> I received my order very quickly! I was very surprised by that. The price is worth it for the product. This is a holy grail for me because I&#x27;m usually on the go and I can do what I need to a few minutes after using this.</li>
    <li> Polish stays on for a week or more.</li>
    <li> I love this top coat. Dries fast and leaves glass like shine. When I received this order it was broke and all spilled through the box. amazon refunded money so will order again.</li>
    <li> Fantastic savings with this! I love Seche Vite, salon perfect nails in a flash. Some people claim it sometimes shrinks nail polish, but I find that is due to waiting too long before applying Seche Vite. I recommend applying after the 2nd coat of color on one hand at a time...do not paint all ten nails and then apply. I generally apply one coat on all ten fingers and then as soon as I get the 2nd coat on one hand I apply the SV topcoat, then I go on and apply the 2nd coat of color and Seche Vite to the other hand and I never have any shrink. I also highly recommend purchasing a bottle of Seche Vite Restore, it is also great for thinning older polishes.</li>
    <li> I am a dude.  Dude&#x27;s should not write reviews for nail polish products, unless you like wearing it... Which is totally cool, but not my style.  No, not for me, but this was purchased for my wife.  She loves the stuff.  She&#x27;s came to me multiple times after doing her nails and said &amp;#34;OMG look at my great nails!  I just did them and then did the dishes and they still look great!&amp;#34;  When she tells me that, I say... &amp;#34;You did the dishes?  I guess there is a first time for everything.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She does not laugh.  Myself and my humor is like my wife&#x27;s nails after she uses this stuff... Dry and safe to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She says get them, her only issues is that sometimes the stuff peels after a few days.  But it&#x27;s fast drying and protects her nails really well.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with Seche Vite Top Coat. It dries nail polish quickly. Nail polish lasts much longer with Seche Vite applied. I will definitely buy this product gain.</li>
    <li> Dries super fast and this is a great bargain! I used to use Essie Good To Go quick dry top coat. I would run into the problem of it thickening up too much in the smaller bottle. Seche Vite does not do this much at all. I will definitely be buying again. I change my polish every few days and usually spend a lot of time on nail art. One thing I don&#x27;t want to do is ruin my nails after spending an hour or two on them. This top coat protects my art and provides great shine.</li>
    <li> best and fastest drying top coat ever! buy it!</li>
    <li> The best top coat ever.</li>
    <li> seche vite is my tried and true top coat for the last eight years, and it has never failed me. I&#x27;ll try other products every so often to come right back to this one. it goes on smooth and dries fast.</li>
    <li> For the price of two bottles at regular price, you get enough in this set for eight bottles of Seche Vite. Best deal ever!</li>
    <li> This is the best nail polish top coat. It dries really quickly and is the shiniest and hardest that I&#x27;ve ever tried. It lasts about 10 days before any chipping shows and I&#x27;m very hard on my nails. I like keeping my nails looking good to prevent myself from biting them off so it matters a lot to me that my nail polish isn&#x27;t chipping. I can&#x27;t believe you can basically get 8-9 regular bottles in this kit. It&#x27;s so much cheaper than buying it at the drugstore.</li>
    <li> Great value for a superior product!  Dries nails quickly, adds a deep shine, and protects nails for several days.</li>
    <li> Smells funky and potent, but isn&#x27;t a problem once dry. Makes nail polish dry fast and shiney. Wish it would also make polish last longer though.</li>
