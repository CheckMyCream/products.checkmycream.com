      <li>This is by far the best mascara I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>I love the brush, as it separates my lashes really nicely.</li>
      <li>The silicon wand was easy to use to break up any clumps that tried to form, which wasn&#x27;t as many as I&#x27;m used to, and the coverage wasn&#x27;t exceptional, but sufficient for my day to day needs.</li>

      <li>Love this formula.</li>
      <li>I would recommend to try this out for sure.</li>
      <li>it for sure is a clump crushes.</li>
      <li>I love this mascara.</li>
      <li>This has become my favorite mascara.</li>
      <li>Sure, the makeup itself may also have some non-clumping qualities but wouldn&#x27;t all mascara?</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m sure its quill-like design is the reason the mascara doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Waterproof mascara at it&#x27;s finest. Love this formula. Worked all day with no settling of black under the eyes or black flakes bugging my eyes. Wish it wasn&#x27;t one of those plastic nubbed applicators tho.</li>
    <li> Not waterproof. The &amp;#34;clump crushing&amp;#34; worked the way it was supposed to, but it was absolutely not water resistant. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> the product is listed as &amp;#34;water resistant&amp;#34; which means it shouldn&#x27;t run down  your eyes or straighten your lashes after you&#x27;ve curled them.  I looked @the products contained after I&#x27;d applied the mascara &amp; the 1st listing is water which means it&#x27;s not water resistant but a water based product.  This product doesn&#x27;t even deserve one star &amp; it&#x27;s falsely advertised as water resistant.</li>
    <li> This product flakes horribly no matter how much you use. Soon after you&#x27;ve used it you&#x27;ll have little flakes all over your face. I don&#x27;t use a whole lot and still end up with small clumps on my lashes. The mascara is a bit hard to wash off. The brush does a very good job of gripping the lashes but I won&#x27;t purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Great coverage and length!</li>
    <li> Really great mascara. If you like natural looking then alone is perfect or it works great with other mascara to give a clean and lengthening effect! Great black color and definitely doesn&#x27;t clump. Love this a ton!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok for voluminous eyelashes but does not make them look larger.</li>
    <li> comes off fairly easily with coconut oil or un-petroleum jelly.  It is a bit watery, but it doesn&#x27;t clump.  You should let it dry for a few seconds between coats.</li>
    <li> Works great. Have had no problems.</li>
    <li> I really like this mascara but have to give it 3 stars because it&#x27;s not waterproof like it says. It&#x27;s a good mascara if you don&#x27;t need waterproof but I have watery eyes and it&#x27;s not fun to have makeup running down your face.</li>
    <li> I have been buying the waterproof Great Lash by Maybelline for years. Having lived in a tropical area for most of my life, I needed something that wasn&#x27;t going to smudge or smear during the day. It was when I started to notice my eyelashes were looking thin and short that I felt waterproof was too much all the time. I love the that its water resistant instead of proof be because it stays on when I need and comes off when I want. Also, instantly noticed longer looking lashes, best brush ever!</li>
    <li> Like it so much!!!! Nice price but godd quality</li>
    <li> I am pretty amazed! No clumps for sure. Goes on well. Makes lashes look longer and fuller. For the price - YOU CAN&#x27;T BEAT IT!</li>
    <li> The usual mascara that you can buy anywhere, It was for my granddaughter and she is Very Very picky. She wears Sephora, Clinique, etc. She does like this particular mascara. It was comparable in price so everyone is happy! I use Covergirl products and they are good products.</li>
    <li> Just like it says.....clump crusher!  No clumps, long lash look...my favorite &amp; only.</li>
    <li> Good product and Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> This does not lengthen or volumizing and does not behave like most waterproof mascaras in that it does not help keep the curl after using an eyelash curler. Also the color is more of a gray black than a true black. I don&#x27;t recommend this product compared to other waterproof formulas</li>
    <li> great mascara.  Reasonably priced and works well.  better than the $20 ones I buy!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t clump and goes on easily. Stays on all day and comes off easily with water and soap.</li>
    <li> This is my go-to mascara.  My lashes, all 10 of them, lean together in little triangles, making clumps inevitable.  This separates and doesn&#x27;t clump.  It also does not smear below my eyes as the day goes on.  The only thing keeping it from a 5 star review is that it does not lengthen as much as I need it for my stubby little lashes.  Still, it&#x27;s the best I have found so far, including the really expensive brands.</li>
    <li> Perfect! This is a great mascara</li>
    <li> This mascara made my lashes uncurl immediately.  I also found flakes of it under my eyes throughout the day.  Not planning to give it a second try.</li>
    <li> Good coverage. Eyelashes look full and long.</li>
    <li> Last all day without coming off.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite everyday mascara. I have some uncanny ability to get mascara all over my eyelids and under my eyes when applying most mascaras. It is a mix of both the wand and the formula with this mascara that keeps that from happening which is SO GREAT. It is important to remember this is water-resistant, not water-proof. It will hold up to some sweating and moisture but if you go swimming or shower it is probably going to come off. The only downside to this water-resistant formula is it really does not resist tears at all. It might be something about the saltiness of tears. If your eyes leak sometimes from wind/cold like mine do, the mascara will run a little, so keep this in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Applies easily&lt;br /&gt;Buildable&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t flake off during the day&lt;br /&gt;Resists moderate amounts moisture&lt;br /&gt;Removes easily with face wash or makeup remover&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Will run if your eyes tear up&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note: I really wish Covergirl would make their LashBlast wands interchangeable. The tube parts of the different brands of LashBlast appear almost identical but the wands don&#x27;t fit inside other tubes. I bought a tube of Lash Bloom (the pink tube) water-proof which is really nice and really water-proof, but the wand and brush is so terrible! I tried to basically make the best mascara ever by putting the wand from this tube into the Lash Bloom tube but it wouldn&#x27;t fit.</li>
    <li> So good. I was shocked how the cheap mascara worked way better than the expensive one I had to buy (and then return) from sephora.</li>
    <li> This mascara&#x27;s awesome. Very few clumps, goes on smoothly.</li>
    <li> This will separate your lashes- but not make them thicker nor longer!</li>
    <li> The New World had never used before.&lt;br /&gt; I became really surprising and outstanding performance, while. The very best products.</li>
    <li> The Covergirl Clump Crusher Water Resistant Mascara is one of my all-time favorites! It lengthens, and thickens my lashes without any clumping! I  have tried so many different mascaras and this one is a keeper. It really does what it says it will, and lasts all day...clump free. I like the brush a lot, the shape and texture. The color is a true black, which is what I ordered. The bright green tube is easy to find in my makeup bag too. I received this mascara free with a coupon, but my opinions are my own. I will be looking for this same brand/kind again when I need it.</li>
    <li> No clumps and I really like the brush/applicator!</li>
    <li> Been using this product for a while.  Very Happy with the way it goes on and how long it lasts.</li>
    <li> I tend to have sensitive eyes and this mascara does not irritate my eyes at all!  I love Covergirl mascara and this is the first time I have tried Clump Crusher.  I am completely satisfied with how easy it is to apply and that it does not wipe or flake off.</li>
    <li> Only water resistant. I neglected to notice that in the description. Gets flakey after only a few hours.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara and its a good price. Didn&#x27;t clump and made my lashes look longer.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s water resistant, I guess, but not water-PROOF. I laugh a lot, to the point of crying, and this mascara does NOT hold up. I definitely have raccoon eyes after a good cry-laugh. I wish it were actually water-proof. Other than that, I love it. It makes my lashes look wonderful and completely clump free. A more natural look, still full, yet separated.</li>
    <li> A fan of the Covergirl Lashblast Volume in Waterproof, I decided to try this guy out and was glad I did.  It&#x27;s an affordable mascara offered on the site and you can sometimes even get this for cheaper with a Covergirl coupon that Amazon likes to give out.  This was exactly what I needed to get beautifully separated lashes.  The formula was good and lasts throughout the day, and the brush is awesome!</li>
    <li> The only mascara I have found that really does not clump, and I&#x27;ve tried many, from inexpensive drugstore types to expensive department store types.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a make-up expect by any means and I did apply a lash primer first. I wiggled the wand back and forth from the base to the tip on my top lashes and just straight from base to tip on my lower, no wiggle. I only applied one coat to each.  I did have one clump the corner of one eye that wasn&#x27;t there before the mascara.  It was a little thick for my lower lashes so I used a lash comb to kinda thin them out.  This was my first use and will post updates if my opinion changes the more I use it.</li>
    <li> This is amazing. I have straight Asian lashes, but they are long and thick because I use latisse. I like to use this as a base coat or a standalone. Does not flake, does not stick, is lightweight and does not rip out lashes when you wash your face. Really separates and volumizes each lash from base to tip. Works great under coats of other mascara (depending on occasion, I use a couple different, more expensive mascara s). For example, I will do two full coats of this CG Waterproof right when I start my makeup routine and a few minutes later, I add a coat or two of Smashbox&#x27;s full exposure mascara and my lashes look incredible. Careful though- this is $6 or less at Walmart...but it changes prices on amazon all the time from $4-$11! Ps in my opinion- lasts longer than other lashblast versions.</li>
    <li> This mascara doesn&#x27;t have much coverage. And, though it says black the color looks more grey. When I apply as I usually do with other mascaras, the makeup gets on my top eyelid. I&#x27;ve never had this problem before. I don&#x27;t believe I would order this product again. But, that&#x27;s just me.</li>
    <li> It arrived all dried up! Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I really like how full this mascara makes my eyelashes without making them look clumpy. It also does not smear or make my eyelashes so stiff that I feel like they will break off. I love this mascara!</li>
    <li> Not suitable for me because my lashes is short and few</li>
    <li> Sadly, this didn&#x27;t work for me. It says water resistant, but it came off and irritated my eyes. It also didn&#x27;t coat my lashes well at all. I really wanted to like this, but I just couldn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Shipping and packing wise no complaints. I like the mascara itself, but the brush doesn&#x27;t separate my lashes enough and I have to work to avoid clumps. Love the water resistant as opposed to waterproof. Stays on without being impossible to remove.</li>
    <li> One of the worst mascaras I&#x27;ve ever used--and I&#x27;m old enough to remember when there weren&#x27;t any waterproof, smear proof, clump proof, messy, gooey, disaster proof, no racoon-eyes, &amp;#34;formula&amp;#34; mascaras.  I don&#x27;t can&#x27;t say for sure if the whole tube just dried out very quickly. It was difficult enough to get any coverage from the start. I didn&#x27;t see any noticeable difference from the time I started using it to when it was gone...which also seemed a little faster than usual. No matter how much I dig and twist, I can&#x27;t get enough on the brush.  ***Revision to clarify for the manufacturer that, to their credit, made the effort to respond: .Originally, I said, &amp;#34;I have to keep applying it, wait a minute for it to dry, apply more, wait a minute for it to dry...&amp;#34;  That statement was inaccurate, and somewhat dramatized to emphasize that it&#x27;s difficult to get enough coverage, and frustrating that I have to spend more time applying this product than I have when using other brands. I&#x27;m usually in a rush to get ready, and I don&#x27;t have time to literally wait for each coat to dry. I spend no more than a minute or two total. This is one of the few brands that require more than one coat; even then, it&#x27;s not enough, and it seems to last for far less time.***</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t go on thick so it takes several coats. It&#x27;s OK for waterproof.</li>
    <li> I would purchase this item again. No smudging and easy to remove. I have sensitive eyes, and this did not give me any irritation.</li>
    <li> My stubborn lashes don&#x27;t stay curled unless I use waterproof/water resistant mascara. This is neither and it dragged my lashes down immediately after applying it.</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara I have ever had. It separates and volumizes beautifully, and the length is extremely buildable. The curved wand is very easy to use. The formula is strong enough not to come off at every drop of water, yet it&#x27;s not torture to get off. I am totally sticking with this!</li>
    <li> This mascara is not that great. Does not do much at all to make lashes look fuller or longer. Doesn&#x27;t seem to clump, flake or smudge which is a plus and keeping me from giving it one star. Much better products are available.</li>
    <li> I have to admit that I am a mascara fan. A dab of it along with eyeliner and I can walk out the door. The thing that I like about Covergirl&#x27;s Clump Crusher is that I can apply it in the morning and I do not have to reapply it until later on in the evening (only if it&#x27;s a date night;) I also like that it does what it claims to do, crushes the clumps. Normally I have to try to take a Q-tip to separate my eyelashes afterwards, but with this I do not. I just put it on and go. I would recommend this for anyone that has battled the &amp;#34;it looks like I have only one gigantic eyelash!&amp;#34; look because it truly separates the lashes and lifts them.</li>
    <li> Great price on Amazon, especially with the online coupon. The product itself does exactly as described.</li>
    <li> This goes on so nice and clean, honestly I was so surprised! I didn&#x27;t have to wipe down the brush to get a clean look. It just happens. It does not flake on me, I use two to three coats, only, and it looks beautiful. Not a clump or lump to be found. Thank you so much Cover Girl, another great product from your line that lasts all day. I love it !</li>
    <li> great mascara and great price</li>
    <li> Favorite mascara forever, even compared to some high-end ones. I recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> I was sweating and it just ran down my face, I was at school at the time too. First day :(</li>
    <li> I love this mascara. Just as the name says, there are NO clumps! I hate when my eyelashes stick together leaving a gap in the lashes. With this wand and brush my eyelashes do not stick at all. It separates and coats each lash, making them look longer and fuller! I am a huge fan and this is my go to mascara for everyday use!  Just a heads up, this mascara is water resistant and not water proof. So say goodbye to those racoon eyes for good! I like that it is very easy to remove without using any harsh makeup removers! I definitely give it two thumbs up!!!</li>
    <li> This does a fantastic job separating my lashes, defining them and lengthening as well - I would *almost* compare to benefits They&#x27;re Real, but not quite.  Definitely waterproof, but do notice I can&#x27;t wear on lower lashes without transferring under my eyes into my concealer as the day goes on - boo. I have yet to find a mascara that doesn&#x27;t do this, so that&#x27;s why I still give it 4 stars!  With S&amp;S it&#x27;s a great savings and usually can find digital coupons to go with it!</li>
    <li> I thought since the product claimed to be water resistant it wouldn&#x27;t smudge or run easily but my eyes started tearing and the mascara began to run.  It kept running until it was off.  I didn&#x27;t use soap and water, it just came off because my eyes were tearing.  I ended up throwing it away and got waterproof mascara instead.</li>
    <li> I like this mascara. It endures the day quite well and is super inexpensive.I don&#x27;t really care for the curved wand, feels like I always need to rotate it as I apply the mascara. Would prefer a straight wand, but that&#x27;s a personal preference.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very particular about mascara, as I hate fussing with it trying to get clumps out. This wand worked really well for me. The silicon wand was easy to use to break up any clumps that tried to form, which wasn&#x27;t as many as I&#x27;m used to, and the coverage wasn&#x27;t exceptional, but sufficient for my day to day needs. Easy to remove with makeup wipes. For a really dramatic evening out I&#x27;ll still go with a two-stage fiber-plus-topcoat option, but this is my new daily mascara. I was specifically comparing it to Manga Eyes, which I just bought--that was dramatic, but still not as much as two-stage mascaras, clumped like crazy on me, and was a bit wet for my tastes.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for an exact dupe of Benefit&#x27;s &amp;#34;Yes, They&#x27;re Real&amp;#34; mascara -- this is it! Identical brush and indistinguishable formula from Benefit&#x27;s flagship mascara make this my favorite mascara hands down.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best mascara I&#x27;ve used. The reason my other mascaras clumped was because too much of the product came out on the brush. With this mascara, however many coats I put on, it just won&#x27;t clump. It does require a few coats for my thin lashes, because it goes on more sparingly than other mascaras I&#x27;ve tried. (I have thin lashes, so I use lash primer under this mascara.) During the day, two coats of black usually suffice for my fair-colored lashes. I use three or four coats in the evenings or on special occasions to make my lashes look dramatic and luxurious. It comes off easily with my creme skin cleanser and even easier with soap and water. And, since it&#x27;s so affordable, I am very happy with this product and will stay with it.</li>
    <li> I wear it on my bottom lashes by itself then as a base coat with the top lashes before topping it off with IT Mascara. This mascara never bothers my eyes the way most water-proof/water-resistant mascara usually does.And, It actually HAS product in the tube and lasts 2 months. Love it, love the price (I just got it with a coupon).</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this mascara. I can apply as many coats as I want, and even pair it with other mascaras and my lashes never clump! :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a little disappointmed with the fact that it says &amp;#34;Waterproof&amp;#34; but doesn&#x27;t stay on.  I have an allergy in my eye and it waters sometimes. Therefore, the mascara comes off on my bottom lashes and I have to re-apply it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still using this product till I find something better, but I have mascara under my eye EVERY SINGLE MORNING from just blinking! Not a fan.</li>
    <li> Best mascara ever! I have tried every thickening and lengthening mascara in the drugstores and a few from department stores, This is by far the best for me. It lengthens and thickens beautifully with no clumps and lasts all day. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a kook about my mascaras so take that into mind when reading my review. I curl my eye lashes every morning with a blow dryer and eye lash curler. If the first ingredient in the mascara is &#x27;water,&#x27; I&#x27;m not impressed... this means that the moment I put this on my eye lashes, they will be very wet and fall. If you don&#x27;t curl your eye lashes, this mascara is perfectly fine. This product; however, has a first ingredient of water. That&#x27;s a fail, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this mascara! The shape makes all the difference in the world. I also like how it is a rubber type material instead of like the the kind maybelline uses. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I usually use the orange waterproof one which I really like and use daily, but thought i&#x27;d give it a try as it&#x27;s the same brand.  Totally different.  It makes my lashes lose it&#x27;s curl after I&#x27;ve perfectly curled them.  The texture is nice but unfortunately it&#x27;s going in the trash.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t wear much makeup, mostly because I don&#x27;t want to spend the time applying it. Also, mascara tends to be problematic because it often clumps or smears under my eyes and then I have to take more time to fix it. So I was intrigued by the claim made by this formulation and I decided to give it a try. I&#x27;m glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The applicator brush is spiky. Not scarily so, but I&#x27;m sure its quill-like design is the reason the mascara doesn&#x27;t clump. Sure, the makeup itself may also have some non-clumping qualities but wouldn&#x27;t all mascara? Another reviewer mentioned cleaning and re-using the brush and I think that&#x27;s a brilliant idea. Since the bristles are so firm and well-defined, the mascara is combed onto my lashes and there are no clumps (at least so far). Not even on my bottom lashes, where I generally try to just dab a little color and ALWAYS ended up with unsightly clumps, before using this brush. I am a fan!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also easily removed with eye makeup remover but by the end of a 16-hour day, it has faded (I only apply one coat) and sometimes I just use my cleanser and call it a night.</li>
    <li> I did not find this to be long wearing or waterproof. By lunch there were smudges under my eyes. Hate I can&#x27;t recommend it because the price is great. Had to switch back to my normal more expense mascara.</li>
    <li> wish it were a little more tearproof other than that great coverge!</li>
    <li> This is a very poor quality mascara! I realize the price is low, but OMG I never thought a mascara can be this bad!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mascara appears to be of medium consistency, which should be a good thing, but unfortunately it is not. The mascara does not coat lashes at all! It goes on spotty and clumps up lashes. They appear uneven and misshaped, a very unfortunate look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through the day mascara begins to fall off in large chunks. At first I thought I must have some sort of dust on me, but then I realized that it&#x27;s my mascara. The falloff chunks are large and very noticeable. Flaking starts ~3h into wearing the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said one must expect mascara to wash off well. Alas! No such luck! It is impossible to wash this product off completely---it just smears around. I tried my tried and true Bioderma--nope, Nivea makeup remover---just smears too, coconut oil---nope, just flakes and smears. Horrible!&lt;br /&gt;(washing it off is the worst part by far!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this product to anyone!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum it up---this mascara excels in failure.</li>
    <li> Definitely doesn&#x27;t clump but the brush is very small. I use it &amp; the orange one together.</li>
    <li> It keeps my lashes separated and long, so that&#x27;s good. I just don&#x27;t like how it weighs my lashes down when I apply it, but I always have that problem with mascara.</li>
    <li> Best mascara for lower lashes hands down.</li>
    <li> Great coverage and was as expected</li>
    <li> This mascara does what it promises... lengthens and separates. I love it! It&#x27;s the perfect mascara for a &amp;#34;no makeup&amp;#34; makeup day. I also like to use this mascara first and then use a volumizing mascara over it. Love it.</li>
    <li> Nice mascara and fast delivery</li>
    <li> Good choice from Covergirl for this water resistant mascara. Easy on and easy off also.</li>
    <li> This is the only one for me it works GREAT!!!! Thank You</li>
    <li> Not a bad mascara. Can&#x27;t say anything great or bad about it honestly. Just an everyday mascara.</li>
    <li> This mascara is perfect for me- water resistant, doesn&#x27;t clump, and a good price</li>
    <li> My only complaint is that I wish it was waterproof, but other than that, this mascara is amazing. Try it--you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I AM 42 w/ever shrinking eyes.  This went on easily with litterally no clumps.  It did not make my lashes super long, it did however make it seem like I had twice as many lashes as I do.</li>
    <li> Its name is an apt description of the product. My lashes look more prominent but not clumped. I prefer this mascara to the pricier brands I&#x27;ve tried. I have sensitive skin but tolerate this product. To be sure I don&#x27;t run out of it, I&#x27;ve ordered it several times.</li>
    <li> got this product FAST...today is my first day wearing the product...so far pleased...no smudges on the lower lashes...hop washes off as easily as described</li>
    <li> I bought this to make up $35 to get free shipping, and also because amazon was offering a $1.00 off coupon. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from it, but it actually is a very good mascara. I thought, no clumps? yeah right, how many mascaras promise not to clump, but they do. I was so wrong. IT DOES NOT CLUMP, just like it says. It&#x27;s great. The spiky brush looks a little scary, but it works.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara. After using a lot of different mascaras I find this one to be the best I have tried so far!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this mascara here on amazon, but since i&#x27;m here searching for new mascara I thought i&#x27;d do a review.  I really wanted to like this mascara, I noticed before I bought it that it read, \\&quot;water resistant&#x27; rather than &#x27;waterproof&#x27;, wasn&#x27;t sure it meant the same thing.  The first time I used it I really liked it (I thought),.. when I applied it, it did make my lashes thicker/longer, and it went on nicely,..didn&#x27;t notice any curl disappearing.  End of the day when I looked in my magnifying mirror I was horrified to see flakes all over.  I made excuses for it thinking perhaps it was the humid weather, maybe I rubbed my eyes accidently..&lt;br /&gt;Few days later I tried it again, this time upon application, my time (what seems like hours) it takes to curl, curl, and re-curl my stick-straight lashes before applying mascara, all for nothing because the curl just melted off as soon as the brush hit the lashline.  Since my lashes were already ruined for the day, off I went on my way &amp; on returning home &amp; getting ready to wash my face, yep,- flakes all over my face.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, It takes me too long to curl my lashes only to have the mascara undo it, and the flakeage...yikes..&lt;br /&gt;And yes, the fat applicator is awkward to handle.  this tube went in the garbage.  Back to the search.</li>
    <li> Good price for this product.</li>
    <li> I have used the same mascara brand for ten years, but I decided to try this kind and I&#x27;m.very happy I did.  No clumping!  I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I find this mascara true to not clumping. This is also one of the few mascaras I can wear that does not burn my eyes. I will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> My favorite mascara. Not as thick as some other, more expensive brands that I&#x27;ve used, but you can comb out all the clumps with the rigid bristle brush and reapply several layers without it looking like spider legs. The water-resistant feature keeps it from smearing, and it lasts most of the day without flaking (though by evening, it is flaking a little) I have sensitive skin and eyes, and it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
    <li> love this macara. i havent tried very many but this one has been my favorite so far. ive been using it for a year and it never disappoints</li>
    <li> Very good.  I like the Covergirl Clump Crusher mascara, it wears well and remains on my lashes throughout the day.  As I have short lashes, this product has done a great job of bringing them out and making them appear longer.  Very satisfied, will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I like the way this mascara goes on - it&#x27;s not clumpy at all (as made clear by the product name), so it does a great job darkening my lashes.  Unfortunately, that&#x27;s about all it does.  Luckily I have naturally long lashes to begin with, because it doesn&#x27;t really lengthen, and it doesn&#x27;t make them fuller.  All it really does is make the lashes I already have stand out more, and really I have better mascaras for that.  The color is a little ashy, not nearly dark enough.  At least it doesn&#x27;t give me raccoon eyes.</li>
    <li> Much cheaper than the store.  Does not clump or run.</li>
    <li> Best mascara I have used. I will buy again</li>
    <li> The description indicates water resistant...I understand it is not waterproof, but I see no water resistant elements to this product</li>
    <li> Not much to say here.  Great product at an amazing price!  Love the coupon feature with amazon!</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good water resistant mascara. The color is nice,  I love the brush, as it separates my lashes really nicely. The biggest caveat that I have with this is that it flakes off throughout the day. It does appear to be water proof as it doesn&#x27;t run, but it just gradually flakes off, leaving my lashes almost bare by the end of the day, which is a problem for me as I have no color to my lashes at all.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different types of mascara and this is the only one I will purchase from now on.  It goes on nicely, with very few clumps, it doesn&#x27;t go on too heavy (no Tammy Faye Baker eyes) and, while it isn&#x27;t water-proof, it stays on during the course of an average day (no mascara droppings under your eyes!)</li>
    <li> This is a great mascara, no clumps as the name says. It is however, very basic. I like to have more volume and length... With this stuff you really have to layer it on which can be time consuming. If you naturally have thick and full lashes, this stuff would be great for you. If you have thin and spare lashes like me, don&#x27;t bother. Something like l&#x27;oreal voluminous butterfly mascara will be much better for you.</li>
    <li> I heard so many great reviews of this mascara, I just had to try it. All it did was crumble off and get in my eyes all day. I don&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve ever had a problem like that with any other mascara I&#x27;ve tried, and CERTAINLY not to this extent. It&#x27;s the first mascara I&#x27;ve ever trashed instead of just letting it bury itself in the bottom of the drawer. To its credit, it looks great when it goes on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I wish I had looked at the low-star reviews before I bought this. Seems like I am not alone in getting mascara crumbs in my eyes.</li>
    <li> This mascara is definitely not waterproof OR water resistant or whatever the hell it wants to be called. I got caught in the rain and all my mascara ran down my face. This never happened with my other waterproof mascara (Maybelline Full &amp; Soft). Ridiculous! It also flakes off and gets into my eyes in the middle of the day. It also comes off if my eyes get watery enough and goes down my face. Only thing I like about this mascara is that it really does prevent clumps, but it&#x27;s not waterproof so it&#x27;s useless to me.</li>
    <li> Does not clump and goes on easy</li>
    <li> Tried this for two reasons.  A make up artist on YouTube suggested it as she loved it and her lashes looked great after applying it.  The second reason was the price I got it for....with coupon $1.50.  I really do like it!</li>
    <li> I will rebuy this mascara again and again, it really doesn&#x27;t lie, and at the amazon deal price its unbeatable. I keep a tube of diorshow around only because I love it, but this is my new everyday mascara. It also removes easily with soap and water, while holding up all day - the best of both worlds.</li>
    <li> If I cry it will smudge...its water resistant, not water proof. I knew that though when I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;My lashes look full and long and doesn&#x27;t get all clumped up. It works!</li>
    <li> Good Product for a great price.  I purchased this as an add-on to another order and was very happy with the purchase.  It did cause some eye irritation, but it wasn&#x27;t anything completely unmanageable.  The brush was curved at the end which made reaching the little lashes much easier!</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara that I have found so far! it&#x27;s low in price and works better then most of the expensive brands! it for sure is a clump crushes. the soft  bristles makes it go on smooth and clump free. I also do not need to keep re applying this. I have short straight lashes and this make them look like a movie star. I but the black color and its perfect. My lashes are super dark and look amazing with this. I would recommend to try this out for sure. you can usually get this onsale at any drug store. I like this better then mac, estee lauder, benefit and other high end mascara I have already tried</li>
    <li> first few applications seemed to clump after that its perfect, seperates, makes my eyes look beautiful</li>
    <li> This mascara is pretty good, definitely doesn&#x27;t clump. I usually only use it on my bottom lashes because it doesn&#x27;t hold my lashes curled. The only down part is that it&#x27;s not very waterproof or at all it washes easily with water.</li>
    <li> This was a fluke purchase....normally use Loreal or Maybelline mascarras but the bright green package caught my eye....so glad too because it is the best so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the brush...love that it applies quickly...love that it doesn&#x27;t smear under my eyes after wearing it all day ( and I use eye cream!).  Another plus, it removes easily with soap and water, no need for my eye makeup remover.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pleased. Gave it a four star rating due to the fact I have only worn it a few times. Goes on well. Would order again!</li>
    <li> This is a great product, I got it for around $2. And it probably can stand up against some of the more pricy mascara&#x27;s I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
    <li> terrible, doesn&#x27;t fill out lashes at all.  I don&#x27;t know if this was dried up or what but it was like I had nothing on.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara! It doesn&#x27;t clump, near as much other mascaras! Product came quickly and in great condition!</li>
    <li> This has become my favorite mascara. I&#x27;ve spent tons of money on high priced department store brands trying to find a mascara that doesn&#x27;t clump or leave dark smudges under my eyes. Great, great, great!</li>
    <li> Great product - nothing special but does the trick for everday wear. Lasts maybe two months... then seems to dry up. Otherwise, soft and black and the long wand and applicator are easy to use.</li>
    <li> I got this mascara to try when Amazon stopped having my usual mascara available for subscribe &amp; save. Big mistake, the mascara started flaking off within hours.</li>
    <li> I liked how this product applied (with no clumps), but I found that this &amp;#34;water-resistant&amp;#34; formula irritated my eyes a lot and didn&#x27;t resist water more than the normal kind. I now use the regular (not water proof or resistant) kind when I don&#x27;t need water-proof mascara, and I really like it.</li>
    <li> Great mascara for the price! Sometimes I use it on top of another mascara for an amped-up nighttime look (but without the clumps another mascara would create!)</li>
    <li> Worth the price, indeed it&#x27;s waterproof.</li>
    <li> Have used it for years.</li>
    <li> Well-made product, I am satisfied</li>
    <li> My teenager loves this!  She says there are no clumps, and I don&#x27;t see any on her.</li>
    <li> Every summer I hunt for a better mascara. For some reason I have trouble with mascaras smudging under my eye and not staying put (even the waterproof ones). I&#x27;m very happy with this mascara- I&#x27;ve been wearing it about a month and have had no smudge problems at all. I also love the brush- it&#x27;s one of those plastic hard ones instead of the bristle kind- because it does a great job at separating the little lashes and getting them to &amp;#34;come out&amp;#34; to be noticed. It definitely lengthens my lashes better than &amp;#34;fattens&amp;#34; or gives volume, but that&#x27;s OK. I put Covergirl Lash Blast (the orange tube- regular, NOT the waterproof one) after I apply the Clump Crusher, and I really like the look. My eyelashes have gotten thinner over the years, but so far this mascara has done wonders for me I&#x27;ll be buying more in the future.</li>
    <li> Stays on as expected.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara. It makes my lashes beautiful and long with no clumps. Even when I get wet it doesn&#x27;t come off.</li>
    <li> very nice for the price!</li>
    <li> I wear it every day. It is very Good, it makes my eyelashes look longer and darker!</li>
</ol>
