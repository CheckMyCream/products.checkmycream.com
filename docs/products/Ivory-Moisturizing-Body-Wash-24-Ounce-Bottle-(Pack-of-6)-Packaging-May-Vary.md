    <li> Great body wash price could be better</li>
    <li> Love the smell and the way it makes my skin feel</li>
    <li> Since my first pregnancy my skin changed and this is the only line of soaps I can use without breaking out.  The smell is great.</li>
    <li> There are a lot of body wash and soaps on the market. Ivory soap has been around FoReVeR and they have it figured out for Value &amp; Quality. This particular fragrance is my favorite. Clean pleasant fragrance without being overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;But I have to say All of their Body Wash fragrances are Great this just happened To be the one my husband said,  \\&quot;gee, you smell good\\&quot;,  Sold. !</li>
    <li> You know . . . if you&#x27;re really going to read a review on $4.00 worth of soap, this might not be the product for you. Me? I like it. I have no idea what a natural waterlily smells like but if it&#x27;s anything like Ivory&#x27;s version, then it must truly be something amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each bottle lasts me about 6 - 8 weeks. Your mileage may vary as I&#x27;m not aware of your specific soap needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take a chance. It&#x27;s only four bucks. If you don&#x27;t like it, toss it in the river.</li>
    <li> I bought this scent and love it more than expensive Bath &amp; Body Works and more than Olay, Dove and other top brands. Trouble is I&#x27;m having a difficult time finding it again. I want to buy 4 bottles so I don&#x27;t run out (and the bottles are big!). I will try the other scents too. I say try it; you will like its smell and that it&#x27;s very moisturizing!</li>
    <li> Gets you clean and smells pretty too. My mother loves it and says she doesn&#x27;t even need to put perfume on. Would recommend others to try it out.</li>
    <li> This stuff has me so impressed! The smell is lovely and it bubbles like no other. Way to go guys!!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a body wash that smelled lovely and offered moisturizing for the dry winter months. This fits the bill perfectly. I&#x27;ll be ordering it again!</li>
    <li> I love Ivory body wash. It&#x27;s all I use now. It&#x27;s creamy and moisturizing without being difficult to wash off like other cream body washes. The scent is calming and not overwhelming. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Cleans well, smells wonderful.  Will purchase again.  Quite satisfied with IVORY&#x27;s body wash.  Bought in bulk and received a better deal.</li>
    <li> Wonderful smell. I feel fresh and clean and I don&#x27;t have that filmy residue.</li>
    <li> this body wash is great and smiles great its a big winner totally  worth the buy with a very great size to it.</li>
    <li> Ivory Soap has always been a favorite of mine, so for that reason, I am not completely disappointed in this product.  The only complaint I do have is that there is not particular aroma to the supposedly scented body wash.  I was so excited that Ivory had come out with a scented product, but then, no real scent.  Otherwise, I still like this Ivory Body Wash and use it every day,  I just can&#x27;t give it a Five-Star rating.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of Ivory products in general. I use the liquid dish soap and the bar soap. This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried the body wash and it is just as great as the other products. Smells great!</li>
    <li> I love this brand of body wash but I did not like the smell of this one as much as I like the green bottle.  Definitely worth buying if you like body wash.</li>
    <li> This is a great new scent that i am trying by ivory. I use the original scent liquid ivory soap religiously. It is the only soap that I will use. It doesn&#x27;t leave a film on your skin, it moisturizes and leaves you smelling great. This smell is just right and not too strong with all of the same positives of the original scent.</li>
    <li> What a wonderful surprise! I had not purchased this scent before, but was wonderfully surprised! I loved it! I will look for this scent to purchase again in the future!</li>
    <li> ♥♥♥ that its a big sized bottle for the price and smells so good, feels smooth and soaps that leave my skin feelin so fresh and so clean always have 5 stars in my book. I would buy this product again and try the other scents from this brand</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t care for the fragrance, kind of like a bug spray and was not long-lasting at all or to my liking at all. Sorry.</li>
    <li> Makes you refresh and invigorating</li>
    <li> I was under the impression that this was hypoallergenic. It isn&#x27;t.</li>
