### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Excellent product.</li>
      <li>I had no frizz and best of all</li>
      <li>One of my fav products when seeking to achieve the perfect twist and bantu knot outs.</li>
      <li>This product has excellent consistency.  </li>
      <li>but I can tell its going to look great tomorrow!  </li>
      <li>Then I spend 5 bucks for Cantu leave in and the twist outs were perfect. .</li>
      <li>This product is incredibly drying.</li>
      <li>u dont have to use alot, twists look greaqt and it smeels good too!</li>
      <li>so I wasn&#x27;t to happy with the defining cream</li>
      <li>Stuff works great</li>
      <li>This works great for twisting my hair.</li>
      <li>Great mosturiziing twist defining cream.</li>
      <li>But my twists turned out great.</li>
      <li>Although, I haven&#x27;t tried that yet, I think it will be great for frizz.</li>
      <li>I have to admit, my twist came out very nice.</li>
      <li>Definitely an amazing product!</li>
      <li>Smells great and gives good definition without drying your hair out.</li>
      <li>I recommend that you use a good moisturizing shampoo and conditioner or a cowash and use a moisturizing lotion when you untwist your hair.</li>
      <li>Good job</li>
      <li>wonderful purchase worth the money</li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>I often do twist-outs and after one use of the Cowash Conditioner and Twisting Cream--I&#x27;m in love!</li>
      <li>It smells amazing like sugar and oranges</li>
      <li>I have a 4a/4b curl pattern and it make my twist out look amazingly defined.</li>
      <li>It did give nice definition under a gel, but added no moisture or weight to my hair.</li>
      <li>What I liked about it was that it wasn&#x27;t sticky, however after I took my twist out, there was no shine.  </li>
      <li>Nice smell but</li>
      <li>Best defining cream I have used thus far.</li>
      <li>As far as my twist out goes, it came out perfect</li>
      <li>My hair also still feels very light, as if there&#x27;s no product in it</li>
      <li>Leading me to purchase more of the &amp;#34;As</li>
      <li>If you can find the trial item promotion, go for it and enjoy!</li>
      <li>I really love it.</li>
      <li>More like a lotion than a cream to</li>
      <li>Still on the search for the perfect holding product, flax seed gel is next.</li>
      <li>I even love the scent of the product.  </li>
      <li>For the price &amp; performance, I think either of these products are a better choice.</li>
      <li>This item was ok for me.</li>
      <li>and I had the most defined curls when I untwisted them.  </li>
      <li>okay.</li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>my hair didnt completely love it</li>
      <li>Love it, it gives the hair hold and shine and helps keep the frizzies away.</li>
      <li>It was ok.  </li>
      <li>it was ok</li>
      <li>Smell is okay too.</li>
      <li>(i.e., I need some weight from my curl creams to control frizz &amp; make my hair more vertical than pyramid shaped).</li>
      <li>It is not greasy, has a great smell and your hair is not hard and crunchy.</li>
      <li>im so lucky i dont use an overwhelming amount of products and was able to identify the cause of my hair breaking off.</li>
      <li>My 4b hair wash and go has strong defined coils I can work with.</li>
      <li>, my hair was strong and growing beautifully &amp; now it is dry and brittle and breaking off.  </li>
      <li>This is by far the best I&#x27;ve found for my natural hair.</li>
      <li>What a great find, and cheaper than other brands I love but can&#x27;t always afford.</li>
      <li>My hair looked like I was standing in humidity all day, with a FRESH braid out!  </li>
      <li>Excellent for short natural hair.</li>
      <li>This stuff is far better than Shea Moistire curl enhanced and better than Cantu as well.</li>
      <li>Nothing special.</li>
      <li>I have shelves full of hair products--</li>
      <li>and I just bought a full size of the Twist Cream.</li>
      <li>Like I said, I love this product and will most likely purchase again.</li>
      <li>I was always thrown off by the high prices in store but after many rave reviews, a push from the clerk and a $14.99 sampler...</li>
      <li>The product leaves a sticky film on my hair and hands that I&#x27;m not too keen on, doesn&#x27;t smell good, and leaves my hair dry.</li>
      <li>I love that part most because I don&#x27;t like greasy or dry looking</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sticking to the Texture me Natural styler and good old oil and water.</li>
      <li>have change to another natural product that works better than this, and leaves my hair with the shine I desire.</li>
      <li>Everyone has to find the right product for their hair, and this is not the one for me.</li>
      <li>This item gives your twist just what it needs, easy to use, has a good smell, not very greasy and does not leave a white residue.</li>
      <li>So glad that I don&#x27;t have to continue to buy different products.</li>
      <li>I had to choose I would use Keracare Twist cream which I similar in formulation but more moisturizing and defining.</li>
      <li>Then the tube states to use the leave in first followed by the twist cream.</li>
      <li>I got all positive results, but for some reason my hair did not like this product.</li>
      <li>This cream is filled with very beneficial ingredients such as: coconut oil, castor seed oil, and shea butter; all things my 4a hair loves!</li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>This product really defines your curls</li>
      <li>and I have really defined twists.</li>
      <li>This product worked really well</li>
      <li>maybe I&#x27;m using too much.</li>
      <li>really curly 3c type hair,i can always rock a twist out but not with this product</li>
      <li>When I used this for my braid outs, it would leave my hair very afro-like.</li>
      <li>Other than that this is an ok product.</li>
      <li>I do love other</li>
      <li>bought this to replace Cantu Shea Butter Repair Cream, which is very rich &amp; heavy, but doesn&#x27;t add a lot of curl definition for me, and Fructis Leave In Cream, which does, but doesn&#x27;t provide much weight.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product for wash and go&#x27;s, twist outs and braid outs.</li>
      <li>The consistency has very little &#x27;slip&#x27; and is not silky or rich, but the feel is not unpleasant.</li>
      <li>It gives my hair a very nice hold without feeling hard or dry.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave that white residue in my hair like many other products do.</li>
      <li>I usually twist my hair because of its thickness.i have been natural for most of my life.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been natural since 2001, and have tried just about everything.</li>
      <li>I used this product multiple times on fresh washed and deep conditioned hair that was soft and moisturised before use.</li>
      <li>It defines twist outs on my 4b/4c natural hair like nothing else can.</li>
      <li>I had to completely retwist and bantu knot</li>
      <li>It also did zero as a 2nd day hair product, which is something I really look for in a cream.</li>
      <li>I had to go back to my cheap 3.99 african pride twist cream, where my bantu knot out would last 3-4 days.</li>
      <li>I regret this decision being as though i have been Natural for 7 years</li>
      <li>I use it for flexirod sets on my 8 year old daughter and two strand twists on myself.  </li>
      <li>This product is thick without making your hair feel gooey, and leaves your hair looking shiny and healthy.</li>
      <li>My hair: long, curly (3b), very dry and fine</li>
      <li>As of now, As I Am appears to deserve the praise and possibly even the high price point.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been natural for 20 years but have only worn my curls out for about a year.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product after using left my hair dry and greasy with no curl definition after about one day. Overall disappointed with this product line. I have 4C hair but my hair did not respond well to the formulation of the product. I had to choose I would use Keracare Twist cream which I similar in formulation but more moisturizing and defining.</li>
    <li> Defines but does not moisturize which is understandable but not forgivable for afro hair.</li>
    <li> This product worked really well but I recommend using a creamy moisturiser before applying this as it sort of dried out my hair.</li>
    <li> It works. Best defining cream I have used thus far. My 4b hair wash and go has strong defined coils I can work with. No frizz. I recommend that you use a good moisturizing shampoo and conditioner or a cowash and use a moisturizing lotion when you untwist your hair.</li>
    <li> Love it, it gives the hair hold and shine and helps keep the frizzies away.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it it made my hair sticky and hard to the touch so I wasn&#x27;t to happy with the defining cream</li>
    <li> I have 3b/3c hair and have been through several products looking for definition and frizz reduction. This product gives me just that, I could actually use this product when I do my wash and go. Although, I haven&#x27;t tried that yet, I think it will be great for frizz. As far as my twist out goes, it came out perfect but I noticed a little build up (flakey) on each use...maybe I&#x27;m using too much. Other than that this is an ok product.</li>
    <li> I did not like this poduct at all. left my twist out liveless and that never happens I have really curly 3c type hair,i can always rock a twist out but not with this product, i didnt like the smell either. I tried usig this as a product in my wash and go and it just weighed down my hair too much.</li>
    <li> I did not purchase this on Amazon but I thought i would still share my experience. I have very thick 4a,b and c hair. I usually twist my hair because of its thickness.i have been natural for most of my life. I have never had such hold, shine and softness with any one product. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who uses twists and twist outs regularly. I even did a few coils as well. It is not greasy, has a great smell and your hair is not hard and crunchy. Excellent product. twist out pattern is well defined...</li>
    <li> Definitely an amazing product! This cream is filled with very beneficial ingredients such as: coconut oil, castor seed oil, and shea butter; all things my 4a hair loves! It smells amazing like sugar and oranges I really love it. It gives my hair a very nice hold without feeling hard or dry. Good job As I Am, they definitely made something that works wonders for kinky hair!</li>
    <li> My hair: long, curly (3b), very dry and fine (i.e., I need some weight from my curl creams to control frizz &amp; make my hair more vertical than pyramid shaped). This product is not a multi-tasker for me.  It did give nice definition under a gel, but added no moisture or weight to my hair. It also did zero as a 2nd day hair product, which is something I really look for in a cream. The consistency has very little &#x27;slip&#x27; and is not silky or rich, but the feel is not unpleasant. More like a lotion than a cream to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this to replace Cantu Shea Butter Repair Cream, which is very rich &amp; heavy, but doesn&#x27;t add a lot of curl definition for me, and Fructis Leave In Cream, which does, but doesn&#x27;t provide much weight. Both of these work very well for me on dry 2nd day hair. For the price &amp; performance, I think either of these products are a better choice.</li>
    <li> This item was ok for me. Nothing special. I won&#x27;t be paying for this anymore because I can get the same results with something less expensive.</li>
    <li> I used this product for a little over a month.  What I liked about it was that it wasn&#x27;t sticky, however after I took my twist out, there was no shine.  Leading me to purchase more of the &amp;#34;As I am&amp;#34; products, such as the Moisturizer Daily Milk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have change to another natural product that works better than this, and leaves my hair with the shine I desire.</li>
    <li> The shine! I washed and deep conditioned my hair so I just put it on my hair twist but I can tell its going to look great tomorrow!  Smell is okay too.</li>
    <li> Before ordering this product, I did some research on YouTube. I got all positive results, but for some reason my hair did not like this product. When the cream dried it left white flakes in my hair as if I had dandruff. The cream also made my hair really hard. I will not purchase this ever again.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Ads shine, softness and definition without icky product build up.  Highly recommend this product for wash and go&#x27;s, twist outs and braid outs.</li>
    <li> I used this cream to twist my hair and I had the most defined curls when I untwisted them.  It does leave the hair a bit hard and dry, but you can offset that by using the Double Butter Cream, Leave-In Conditioner, and a good thick oil like Emu Oil or Coconut Oil.  Excellent for short natural hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still in the evaluation phase but after reading the negative reviews felt compelled to add my two cents. I have only used this once. I was always thrown off by the high prices in store but after many rave reviews, a push from the clerk and a $14.99 sampler...I finally bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my sampler came with a cowash, leave in, and the twist cream. I did not use the cowash, I use something probably considered harsh and would be frowned upon. Then the tube states to use the leave in first followed by the twist cream. I have to admit, my twist came out very nice. I did not need to use any oil at all. I did not use any gel or additional products. I did not have any flaking or dryness. My hair did not turn out dry or hard. In fact, surprisingly, I&#x27;m on my third day of the same twist set with absolutely no oil added. I love that part most because I don&#x27;t like greasy or dry looking hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is natural and extremely coarse, always dry after a wash because I strip it since my shampoo is harsh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that combing it with the leave in was no easier but it does moisturize. I will also remind to keep the hair wet while setting, maybe that&#x27;s the reason for the flake complaints, not sure. But it appears to have worked for me. Will update if I notice any changes. As of now, As I Am appears to deserve the praise and possibly even the high price point.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been natural since 2001, and have tried just about everything. This product is thick without making your hair feel gooey, and leaves your hair looking shiny and healthy. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It defines twist outs on my 4b/4c natural hair like nothing else can. My only warning is that it can leave a strange gooey film on your hair after days of use - even if you re-twist with water. I have a really hard time getting my twist-outs to be defined because of the texture of my hair, so this is a small trade-off for me, but may be a deal-breaker for others. Like I said, I love this product and will most likely purchase again.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me.  I was hoping it would do the trick since I was going back natural.  Been without chemicals in hair for almost a year.  My hair didn&#x27;t take to this defining cream.  I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I have only used this once.  Will have to try again.  Did not produce the results I expected but was not too bad.</li>
    <li> I bought this because people have been raving about it in every hair forum. Everyone has to find the right product for their hair, and this is not the one for me. I had to completely retwist and bantu knot my hair everyday with this cream, because it did not hold. I had to go back to my cheap 3.99 african pride twist cream, where my bantu knot out would last 3-4 days. This As I Am is not enough product for the price I paid for it, especially when I have to use it every single day.</li>
    <li> im not sure if its a pudding or a cream. When i put it in my hair it feel like a pudding. i did a three strand twist with it, came out okay. Its been 4 days, no excess flaking or anything. I will definitely continue to use it</li>
    <li> I am currently transitioning and I have 4 a hair. This product is incredibly drying. I used this product multiple times on fresh washed and deep conditioned hair that was soft and moisturised before use. I only applied just a dab of it to each twist. When I woke up the next day my hair was dry and crunchy and needed some serious remoisturizing. I do love other As I Am products but this one is just not for me.</li>
    <li> One of my fav products when seeking to achieve the perfect twist and bantu knot outs. Smells great and gives good definition without drying your hair out.</li>
    <li> This product really defines your curls I even love the scent of the product.  I will be buying this is the future.</li>
    <li> Left my daughters hair dry and undefined. I used a small amount on each two strand twist and it made her hair very dry.</li>
    <li> When I used this for my braid outs, it would leave my hair very afro-like. It was not defined at all. My hair looked like I was standing in humidity all day, with a FRESH braid out!  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I have a 4a/4b curl pattern and it make my twist out look amazingly defined. This stuff is far better than Shea Moistire curl enhanced and better than Cantu as well. It seems to be cheaper here on Amazon, its $13 elsewhere.</li>
    <li> This product has excellent consistency.  Not too sticky, not too slippery and doesn&#x27;t make the hair look dull.  I use it for flexirod sets on my 8 year old daughter and two strand twists on myself.  A little product goes a long way and the curls it produces are long lasting.  When i use it along with the cowash and buttercream, our styles last the whole week without looking dry or frizzy.</li>
    <li> Not very happy with this product. Not very Moisturizing and does not give the curls that it states on the label.</li>
    <li> It was ok.  Nice smell but my twist last only two days.  I used it for one month and still got the same result.</li>
    <li> Great mosturiziing twist defining cream. It doesn&#x27;t leave that white residue in my hair like many other products do.</li>
    <li> NOT A GOOD PRODUCT FOR MY HAIR AT ALL!!!</li>
    <li> I have 4b/4c hair and I think the product does give defined twist outs, but it&#x27;s not worth it for me. The product leaves a sticky film on my hair and hands that I&#x27;m not too keen on, doesn&#x27;t smell good, and leaves my hair dry. The consistency of it just isn&#x27;t what my hair needs. I&#x27;m sticking to the Texture me Natural styler and good old oil and water. Still on the search for the perfect holding product, flax seed gel is next.</li>
    <li> wonderful purchase worth the money</li>
    <li> I was so displeased with this product :( it left white residue in my daughter&#x27;s her hair once dried. I used as directed and worked it into her hair and did twist outs.  The twists were not defined.  Then I spend 5 bucks for Cantu leave in and the twist outs were perfect. . I&#x27;m so disappointed.</li>
    <li> I use this in conjunction with Jamaican Black Castor Oil, and Kinky Curly Knot Today when I twist my hair after hennaing or doing a cowash. Stuff works great and I have really defined twists.</li>
    <li> Everything I expected it to be</li>
    <li> this cream is the bomb.com! Works well. u dont have to use alot, twists look greaqt and it smeels good too!</li>
    <li> Not sure how I feel about this product. It makes my hair stiff and crunchy with noticeable build up. Not sure if I&#x27;m using to much or not but I&#x27;ve decided to product hunt, once again.</li>
    <li> your hair will be dry, it will look like you have dandruff and it will break. im so lucky i dont use an overwhelming amount of products and was able to identify the cause of my hair breaking off. i was literally pulling out hair.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but thought this product was worth one. I have shelves full of hair products--I&#x27;ve been natural for 20 years but have only worn my curls out for about a year. I&#x27;ve feverishly stocked up on all the usual suspects: Miss Jessie&#x27;s, Kinky Curly, Jane Carter, Cream of Nature et al.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During a promotion I received trial sizes of all As I Am products for the price of S&amp;H. I often do twist-outs and after one use of the Cowash Conditioner and Twisting Cream--I&#x27;m in love! I used as directed (very little of the cream per twist) and my hair had more curl definition with less shrinkage. I had no frizz and best of all, NO FLAKES. My hair also still feels very light, as if there&#x27;s no product in it (and I did scrunch a bit of Jane Carter&#x27;s Nourish &amp; Shine on my scalp and ends for some sheen). FYI, my hair is a 4b/4c mix--it&#x27;s very kinky with tight curls upfront, curls &amp; waves across the middle, and corkscrews in the back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried the other items yet, but am looking forward to it--and I just bought a full size of the Twist Cream. What a great find, and cheaper than other brands I love but can&#x27;t always afford. If you can find the trial item promotion, go for it and enjoy!</li>
    <li> This item gives your twist just what it needs, easy to use, has a good smell, not very greasy and does not leave a white residue.</li>
    <li> I purchased, Curl clarity Shampoo, Coconut  Cowash, Leave-in Conditioner, twist Define cream, moisture milk and Double butter cream. I regret this decision being as though i have been Natural for 7 years, my hair was strong and growing beautifully &amp; now it is dry and brittle and breaking off.  I DO NOT recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> This stuff made my hair feel extremely sticky. But my twists turned out great. I will not purchase this product again. I also purchased the double butter cream it was ok my hair didnt completely love it but I worked wonders in my daughter&#x27;s hair</li>
    <li> I finally found a product to use on my natural hair. This is by far the best I&#x27;ve found for my natural hair. So glad that I don&#x27;t have to continue to buy different products. As I am has it all. This works great for twisting my hair.</li>
