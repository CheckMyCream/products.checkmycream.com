    <li> Product came promptly.  Received exactly what I ordered.   Works well in my existing Electric Razor.</li>
    <li> Ok product when you need one but this last time I picked up a kit that supposedly sharpens your old blade setup. Its just a cream that goes on and does seem to work.But as far as these new units they are also A-OK</li>
    <li> Saw dramatic increase of shaving power. I reccommend changing yours out every 2 years. Mine was going on 4 years of use and was slacking off on neck grooves i read you need to switch out every year. i say go two years.. Anyways, its back to its old self.</li>

    <li> I am a traditional Braun Customer and I need this for my shaver that I&#x27;m using. It&#x27;s a great product but again, you need to replace it every three or 4 months. More you use, it&#x27;ll get old.</li>
