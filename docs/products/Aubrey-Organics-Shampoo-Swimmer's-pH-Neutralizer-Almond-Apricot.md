      <li>Great product!  </li>
      <li>This is by-far the best shampoo for after swim use.  </li>
      <li>Wonderful!</li>
      <li>It looks and feels great!</li>
      <li>and I must say I am impressed for a number of reasons.&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
      <li>I use it twice a day every day and my hair is so happy!</li>
      <li>I can say, it smells great and works great as a body wash.</li>
      <li>It works great</li>
      <li>Does a great job of removing pool chemicals from hair.</li>
      <li>It smells great too.</li>
      <li>Love this shampoo!!  </li>
      <li>That is a VERY nice</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t swim as often as I run, but when I do this seems to get the chlorine out very effectively.</li>
      <li>It smells great, feels great, and does a good job of hydrating your hair after the pool.</li>
      <li>Please please please quit messing with good products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Aubrey Organics works really good.</li>
      <li>Why on earth would they ruin a good thing?</li>
      <li>My hair was very clean and without an itchy scalp afterward as has become common-place for me with the lauryl sulphate shampoos, they just don&#x27;t seem to agree with me since I&#x27;ve let my hair grow out to the beautiful silver-grey color</li>
      <li>it is marvelous conditioner and I am happy to have found these two products as a replacement for my old faithfuls...</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo!  </li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s the most effective shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>so I added more, still didn&#x27;t, so</li>
      <li>what more can I add..</li>
      <li>I also love the fact that it&#x27;s cruelty free and there are no sodium laureth sulftates (sls)!  </li>
      <li>Love the smell</li>
      <li>Love this shampoo.</li>
      <li>On a side note, I&#x27;m pleased that more products these days are manufactured without.  </li>
      <li>and it did work better.</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>It has no sulfates or parabens which I love</li>
      <li>and this stuff keeps my hair healthy.</li>
      <li>I was so excited to get this product over the summer because I love swimming.</li>
      <li>It is runny, and doesn&#x27;t lather easily.</li>
      <li>I have nothing good to say about the new formula.</li>
      <li>I do have fine hair, but this did not work well for me.  </li>
      <li>It used to be fantastic.</li>
      <li>I also use the conditioner... which is probably not a necessity, but a great bonus to add on for extra softness.</li>
      <li>I personally love the smell from the conditioner, which is what I use right after each shampoo so that medicinal smell goes away.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure that sls are what&#x27;s used in detergents.  </li>
      <li>but your hair is still clean.</li>
      <li>It also feels clean after washing.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
      <li>It really seems to make the silver color come out and pop more, subduing any yellowish hues...</li>
      <li>I have seen tremendous improvement in hair texture and softness with a couple uses of this shampoo.</li>
      <li>Smells great and is gentle enough to use every day.  </li>
      <li>OLD version of this shampoo, which contained corn syrup and did not contain bitter almond oil, was a very good (both in terms of aesthetics and effectiveness) shampoo and body wash with a light scent.</li>
      <li>Had higher expectations for this product, but wasn&#x27;t the least bit impressed at all.  </li>
      <li>thing I really like about Aubrey Organics shampoo and conditioner is that, based on the ingredients list, I&#x27;m pretty sure I could eat the stuff</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried to use the shampoo and conditioner for myself, too (my scalp gets very dry in fall/winter months, and I decided to give them a try) and was delighted by the results.</li>
      <li>Makes my hair smell fresh.</li>
      <li>But, I think it is worth it because it is organic.</li>
      <li>It has a very strong almond smell, reminiscent of Jergen&#x27;s hand lotion.</li>
      <li>I like this one in particular because I am very active in the gym and this does a great job of keeping my hair shiny and cleaning all the salty sweat from it without compromising my keratin treatment.</li>
      <li>I swim daily, and I love aubrey&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a non-sulphate, non-sudsing shampoo and this one really fits the bill!  </li>
      <li>I literally freaked out after the first time I used it because my hair turned into straw.</li>
      <li>This is the first swimmer&#x27;s shampoo with no sulfates I ever tried</li>
      <li>I am in love with it...kind of strange to use for first time since I am so used to all the sudsy lather in sulphate shampoos.  </li>
      <li>It did require a little more work to get it through my hair but was SO WORTH it!  </li>
      <li>I originally bought the product in the summer when I was swimming everyday and have now purchased more because I like it so much.</li>
      <li>Also despite using the conditioner, it does not make my hair super soft.</li>
      <li>Strangest and least pleasant shampoo experience ever.  </li>
      <li>It does wash out the chlorine and dirt which gets into my hair either through swimming or going through a very hectic day.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
      <li>use the swimmer&#x27;s version after running, and it seems to work really well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so lightweight that I have to use twice as much to wash all my hair.</li>
      <li>I had brittle hair before I started using Aubrey Organics product and not my hair is so much healthier.  </li>
      <li>It actually stops my hair color from running out so once my L&#x27;oreal everpure sulfate free colorsafe shampoo got finished</li>
      <li>Not only did I not care for the fact that it doesn&#x27;t lather, but my hair just doesn&#x27;t feel clean after use -</li>
      <li>Too harsh for me, so I&#x27;m sticking with sls-free good shampoo such as this one.</li>
      <li>They use it every time after swimming, and their hair is back to normal, perfectly soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>The old formula was thick and nourishing and left my hair soft with beautiful curls, and I don&#x27;t even have curly hair.</li>
      <li>Tried it a few more times and my hair started falling out.</li>
      <li>The new version has done away with these advantages.</li>
      <li>It and all the other Aubrey Organics shampoos and conditioners leave my hair soft and strong.  </li>
      <li>It does not lather well, and makes my hair super dry.  </li>
      <li>I figured it&#x27;s not a lathery shampoo, which is ok, but matting my hair and making it super dry is not ok.  </li>
      <li>I mean very strong - it smells like macaroons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Bought this after some online reasearch for my 8 year old son who swims 6 days a week!</li>
      <li>Their hair looked totally damaged by chlorine, and other shampoos weren&#x27;t able to remove it.</li>
      <li>now completely gone!  </li>
      <li>Only if I put on the matching conditioner hair becomes much softer.</li>
      <li>This shampoo thoroughly cleanses my hair and leaves it soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>The shampoo was thick and easy to apply.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gotten so many complements on the color of my hair lately and this I am attributing to using this shampoo!  </li>
      <li>I need to say though the shampoo is not very lathery, so for the long hair, such as mine, you&#x27;ll probably use up the bottle pretty fast.</li>
      <li>Obviously I generally like them</li>
      <li>If anyone has recommendations for another brand that is similar to the old version of this one, please post it.</li>
      <li>I hope they bring back the old formula.</li>
      <li>Shampoo rids your hair of chlorine and does not dry your hair out.</li>
      <li>I like all natural for my children, but this just doesn&#x27;t take all the chlorine out of their long hair.  </li>
      <li>I left the near full bottle on the locker room bench for some other sucker to try.</li>

    <li> Bought this after some online reasearch for my 8 year old son who swims 6 days a week! I have seen tremendous improvement in hair texture and softness with a couple uses of this shampoo.Love it!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have any complaints about the shampoo or conditioner. I originally bought the product in the summer when I was swimming everyday and have now purchased more because I like it so much. My hair does not feel so frizzy or brittle anymore.</li>
    <li> This is by-far the best shampoo for after swim use.  It does smell a bit medicinal.  I personally love the smell from the conditioner, which is what I use right after each shampoo so that medicinal smell goes away.  I also love the fact that it&#x27;s cruelty free and there are no sodium laureth sulftates (sls)!  On a side note, I&#x27;m pleased that more products these days are manufactured without.  The sodium laureth sulfate is what gives the \\&quot;lather\\&quot; or \\&quot;foam\\&quot; appearance that other shampoos with sls provide.  I&#x27;m pretty sure that sls are what&#x27;s used in detergents.  Imagine putting a detergent on your hair to wash! Too harsh for me, so I&#x27;m sticking with sls-free good shampoo such as this one.</li>
    <li> Shampoo rids your hair of chlorine and does not dry your hair out. Love it</li>
    <li> I purchased this shampoo for my husband and my son who swim regularly. Their hair looked totally damaged by chlorine, and other shampoos weren&#x27;t able to remove it. Aubrey Organics works really good. They use it every time after swimming, and their hair is back to normal, perfectly soft and smooth. They use it with Aubrey Organics Conditioner. I&#x27;ve tried to use the shampoo and conditioner for myself, too (my scalp gets very dry in fall/winter months, and I decided to give them a try) and was delighted by the results. I need to say though the shampoo is not very lathery, so for the long hair, such as mine, you&#x27;ll probably use up the bottle pretty fast.</li>
    <li> I like all natural for my children, but this just doesn&#x27;t take all the chlorine out of their long hair.  My husband insisted I try a chemical brand and it did work better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to cut and paste the same review for the shampoo and conditioner version of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I really like about Aubrey Organics shampoo and conditioner is that, based on the ingredients list, I&#x27;m pretty sure I could eat the stuff (note: don&#x27;t try this at home).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the swimmer&#x27;s version after running, and it seems to work really well. I don&#x27;t swim as often as I run, but when I do this seems to get the chlorine out very effectively.</li>
    <li> I personally don&#x27;t like it because it doesn&#x27;t lather. I also noticed my hair was breaking and feeling really dry. However, I did start swimming at the same time I started using the shampoo so my dry hair may have been from the chlorine. I can say, it smells great and works great as a body wash. Also, I found it a few dollars cheaper at my local Whole Foods.</li>
    <li> I get Keratin treatments so the Aubrey line is the way to go in order to stay away from the rough stuff containing alcohols and sulfates. I like this one in particular because I am very active in the gym and this does a great job of keeping my hair shiny and cleaning all the salty sweat from it without compromising my keratin treatment.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo!!  Smells great and is gentle enough to use every day.  Does a great job of removing pool chemicals from hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for over a decade. It used to be fantastic. Then they changed the formula. Now it is horrible. I agree with the other reviewers about turning the hair into straw. It strips my hair and leaves it brittle. The old formula was thick and nourishing and left my hair soft with beautiful curls, and I don&#x27;t even have curly hair. I have nothing good to say about the new formula. Why on earth would they ruin a good thing? I hope they bring back the old formula. If anyone has recommendations for another brand that is similar to the old version of this one, please post it.</li>
    <li> I like natural products, but I am not sure it takes the chlorine out.  At least it doesn&#x27;t seem to help a lot for daily swimming.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s doing what it supposed and what i expected it to do - been using it for sometime now and have no complaints</li>
    <li> Broken wrap. I have to discard it. WIll not buy again.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo. Cleans and softens.</li>
    <li> Great product!  I&#x27;ve used this shampoo daily for several years now. I swim a mile of laps five days a week and it&#x27;s the most effective shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> This review will be another \\&quot;used to be good\\&quot; review. I&#x27;ve been using Aubrey Organics products for over 20 years. Obviously I generally like them or I wouldn&#x27;t have used them for 20 years. I am also a swimmer and like a chlorine-removing soap to use on my hair and body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The OLD version of this shampoo, which contained corn syrup and did not contain bitter almond oil, was a very good (both in terms of aesthetics and effectiveness) shampoo and body wash with a light scent. The shampoo was thick and easy to apply. The new version has done away with these advantages. It is runny, and doesn&#x27;t lather easily. It has a very strong almond smell, reminiscent of Jergen&#x27;s hand lotion. I mean very strong - it smells like macaroons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While shampooing with it after a swim, my hair began matting together and no amount of gentle massaging would cause the shampoo to lather, so I rinsed it out, leaving behind possibly cleaner but still matted hair. I used the shampoo as a body wash, and again, no lather. After showering, I had dry skin and hair, and plenty of residual chlorine odor on my skin. So this stuff doesn&#x27;t remove chlorine anymore either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had a 2nd shower with this stuff after another swim, and same experience. I left the near full bottle on the locker room bench for some other sucker to try. Please please please quit messing with good products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to Paul Mitchell Shampoo 3 for me.</li>
    <li> Works well for at the beach but do NOT use if you have color treated hair.</li>
    <li> After reading these reviews, I bought this shampoo.  It does not lather well, and makes my hair super dry.  I do have fine hair, but this did not work well for me.  Prefer Ultra Swim</li>
    <li> Had higher expectations for this product, but wasn&#x27;t the least bit impressed at all.  Not only did I not care for the fact that it doesn&#x27;t lather, but my hair just doesn&#x27;t feel clean after use - what more can I add..</li>
    <li> I was looking for a non-sulphate, non-sudsing shampoo and this one really fits the bill!  I&#x27;ve used Biolage for a long time but as I found in the past, my hair seems to &amp;#34;get used&amp;#34; to a product after so long!  So, the switch was to this product...I am in love with it...kind of strange to use for first time since I am so used to all the sudsy lather in sulphate shampoos.  It did require a little more work to get it through my hair but was SO WORTH it!  My hair was very clean and without an itchy scalp afterward as has become common-place for me with the lauryl sulphate shampoos, they just don&#x27;t seem to agree with me since I&#x27;ve let my hair grow out to the beautiful silver-grey color I am now blessed with!  It really seems to make the silver color come out and pop more, subduing any yellowish hues...now completely gone!  I&#x27;ve gotten so many complements on the color of my hair lately and this I am attributing to using this shampoo!  I am also recommending that a follow up to this shampoo is to use the Aubrey GPB conditioner...read my review there...it is marvelous conditioner and I am happy to have found these two products as a replacement for my old faithfuls...sorry, Biolage!</li>
    <li> Strangest and least pleasant shampoo experience ever.  Matted my hair while I was washing it, plus it didn&#x27;t lather so I added more, still didn&#x27;t, so I figured it&#x27;s not a lathery shampoo, which is ok, but matting my hair and making it super dry is not ok.  Needed to leave conditioner in longer afterward to detangle and compensate for the brittle feeling.  Did not like the way my hair felt afterward, either.</li>
    <li> I swim twice a week and was using this shampoo along with the Aubrey swimmer&#x27;s conditioner. After using the shampoo my hair would feel stiff and straw-like. Within a few weeks my hair was breaking like crazy and dull and lifeless. The ingredient that is supposed to help with chlorine is organic corn syrup.</li>
    <li> This shampoo thoroughly cleanses my hair and leaves it soft and shiny. I am an open water swimmer in the Caribbean Ocean at least 3x per week and this stuff keeps my hair healthy.</li>
    <li> Not sure that we would purchase this again. I have seen no real improvement in the color of our children&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> I use it twice a day every day and my hair is so happy! I&#x27;m a swimming instructor so I&#x27;m in the pool mornings and evenings. My hair is no longer disintegrating! It looks and feels great!</li>
    <li> This is the first swimmer&#x27;s shampoo with no sulfates I ever tried and I must say I am impressed for a number of reasons.&lt;br /&gt;1. It does wash out the chlorine and dirt which gets into my hair either through swimming or going through a very hectic day.&lt;br /&gt;2. It actually stops my hair color from running out so once my L&#x27;oreal everpure sulfate free colorsafe shampoo got finished I used this and it worked! That is a VERY nice bonus.&lt;br /&gt;3. It has no sulfates or parabens which I love&lt;br /&gt;4. The smell is different. Makes my hair smell fresh. It also feels clean after washing.&lt;br /&gt;It does not lather that well because of course no SLS that gives it the lather but your hair is still clean. And for those who have 4b/c Afro American type hair who are die hard swimmers WITH color in their hair I would recommend this shampoo.</li>
    <li> When I use this shampoo, my hair feels so dry during washing. Only if I put on the matching conditioner hair becomes much softer.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo!  It and all the other Aubrey Organics shampoos and conditioners leave my hair soft and strong.  I had brittle hair before I started using Aubrey Organics product and not my hair is so much healthier.  It smells great too.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this product over the summer because I love swimming. I literally freaked out after the first time I used it because my hair turned into straw. Tried it a few more times and my hair started falling out. No good! Especially if you have curly hair. Way too drying.</li>
    <li> It takes the chlorine off hair but a lot is required. Also despite using the conditioner, it does not make my hair super soft. But, I think it is worth it because it is organic. To make my hair less frizzy, I do the final wash with Matrix sleek.</li>
    <li> It works great but they are overpriced compared to ather similar products</li>
    <li> Wonderful! Love the smell</li>
    <li> I swim every day and this helps keep my hair under control</li>
    <li> I swim daily, and I love aubrey&#x27;s. It smells great, feels great, and does a good job of hydrating your hair after the pool. I also use the conditioner... which is probably not a necessity, but a great bonus to add on for extra softness.</li>
    <li> No big difference from other shampoos. It&#x27;s so lightweight that I have to use twice as much to wash all my hair.</li>
