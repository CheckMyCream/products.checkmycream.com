      <li>Good price and a huge bottle but</li>
      <li>Has a nice, but strong smell.  </li>
      <li>Excellent product - easier to use (while in the shower) in the smaller bottle though.</li>
      <li>Absolutely love how this shampoo and conditioner makes my hair shine and more manageable.  </li>
      <li>I will keep buying this for sure.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>I love these Hempz products.  </li>
      <li>LOVE IT.</li>
      <li>First of all the smell is amazing!</li>
      <li>way too many things going on inside the stuff itself&lt;br /&gt;it got the job done</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
      <li>My hair looks and feels much better after switching to it.</li>
      <li>I have been using Hemp for many years</li>
      <li>This shampoo is fantastic!</li>
      <li>We love it.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>Love the smell and the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
      <li>any more this is my store for shampoo</li>
      <li>Love this stuff, makes my hair look and smell amzaing</li>
      <li>thankful im able to purchase it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>This goes the same way as that reveiw, its the best product ive used on my head.</li>
      <li>Great clean, fresh smell.</li>
      <li>Happiness is discovering that your favourite shampoo hasn&#x27;t been discontinued, but rebranded! and can be sent to the door in less than a week :) Anyone who&#x27;s a fan of Naturelle&#x27;s Hemp will be happy to know that it smells the same and is still the secrete to a great hair day :)</li>
      <li>My daughters hair smells great for days, it shins and her curls just bounce while it still feels soft verse putting an additional product into it!</li>
      <li>My mom and sister liked this product so much they stopped using their top of the line stuff and fell in love with hemp.</li>
      <li>Your hair will feel clean and smell lovely.</li>
      <li>the smell was so strong</li>
      <li>This is an exceptional conditioner, not only does it smell amazing</li>
      <li>Strong odor, not unpleasant - but definitely better suited as a mens product than womens.</li>
      <li>Hydrating, light.  </li>
      <li>Also the conditioner is not at all smooth on your hair.</li>
      <li>My local beauty supply had discontinued carrying this product so was happy to find it here.</li>
      <li>Cost more money but totally worth it.</li>
      <li>It didnt make my hair feel any diferent than a cheap shampoo does.</li>
      <li>so far so good..</li>
      <li>She says she notices right out that my hair is looking much fuller, showing some curl and smells good...  </li>
      <li>I like a clean smell but again, my hubby loves this</li>
      <li>This product is great for dry air or oily.</li>
      <li>Works great for dry hair but again, it just smells &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; to me.  </li>
      <li>i.e. i can easily identify all the constituent chemicals and they all serve a purpose in cleaning my hair and leaving my scalp feeling good long after a wash</li>
      <li>It is something you have to experience for yourself because it makes your hair feel light and keeps it fresh and clean all day.</li>
      <li>and i can&#x27;t seem to find something such quality as this hemp anywhere for a fair price</li>
      <li>It leaves their hair (and mine) nice and shiny and soft.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been using Hemp for many years now.it is an amazing shampoo for my thick straight hair. I suggest the whole line!</li>
    <li> This formula is part of the treatment I use for dryness due&lt;br /&gt;to the use of tamoxiphen.  It does not over moisturize - it just&lt;br /&gt;does the job.&lt;br /&gt;Kindly,&lt;br /&gt;Rose</li>
    <li> Happiness is discovering that your favourite shampoo hasn&#x27;t been discontinued, but rebranded! and can be sent to the door in less than a week :) Anyone who&#x27;s a fan of Naturelle&#x27;s Hemp will be happy to know that it smells the same and is still the secrete to a great hair day :)</li>
    <li> Perfect formula for an arid climate.</li>
    <li> My local beauty supply had discontinued carrying this product so was happy to find it here. Only regret I have is that the shipping is as much as the product and the packaging was not done very well.  Lid was loose and there was some spillage but still love the shampoo.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I especially like that my hair did not feel stripped or look dull after I washed it. The smell is great to. I loved this product so much I used it on my dogs and their hair was so soft. 5+ stars</li>
    <li> Silky feel to shampoo. That&#x27;s nice. But the scent is very strong, almost masculine and antiseptic. Not what a girl is seeking when wanting to mend her hair.</li>
    <li> Not trying to rip off amazon. But tj max has this stuff all the time the 33.8 ounce for 9.99 I just bought it last night! When they run out I&#x27;ll definitely be coming here!</li>
    <li> makes hair soft and has a strong scent which I like</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this thinking it will smell at all like Hempz...it doesn&#x27;t. (But in their defense, they never said it did) Strong odor, not unpleasant - but definitely better suited as a mens product than womens.</li>
    <li> I dont think it is what I have used before. It didnt make my hair feel any diferent than a cheap shampoo does.</li>
    <li> Hair has never been softer.</li>
    <li> By using this shampoo my hair has been so manageable.  Love the smell and the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
    <li> This shampoo just did not hydrate my hair. My hair was all stuck together in a matte on top of my head, but everyone is different. I suggest trying it for yourself.</li>
    <li> I wrote a reveiw on the conditioner of hemp. This goes the same way as that reveiw, its the best product ive used on my head. Switched from headnshoulder to garnier and these come no where near the hemp product. Leaves it with shine texture and a nice smell. My mom and sister liked this product so much they stopped using their top of the line stuff and fell in love with hemp. Highly recomend this and the conditioner.</li>
    <li> This review should be the same as the one for the conditioner.  I have used it for years after trying many other products.  I always come back to hemp.  My hair feels great after shampooing.</li>
    <li> It was a Xmas present&amp;#34; for this reason we kept it, but many products are above the quality of this one and for much less</li>
    <li> Best shampoo I have ever used.  Your hair smells so beautiful for days. I would recommend it for everyone.  Just try it you will see.</li>
    <li> It smells great!!! Lathers good. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Really liked the shampoo. Left my hair very clean and shiny.  Leaves the hair smelling very nice. Would order again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is just great. Lathers up like you wouldn&#x27;t believe and leaves hair feeling great. Highly recommended and will buy again but this bottle will last forever it seems.</li>
    <li> This is an exceptional conditioner, not only does it smell amazing but it really works.  My hair is on the dry side due to coloring and this shampoo/conditioner combo makes my hair so soft and healthy feeling without a oily feeling.  My son who has oily hair also uses this shampoo/conditioner because it helps remove the excess oil without drying out his hair.  This product is also very reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> Very good. Very fast. I don&#x27;t go to the shopping center any more this is my store for shampoo and i can&#x27;t seem to find something such quality as this hemp anywhere for a fair price</li>
    <li> Your hair will feel clean and smell lovely. It doesn&#x27;t seem to strip your hair of its natural oils. Very good product for short or long hair.</li>
    <li> great product, lasts forever it seems and i really feel good about not having unnecessary chemicals seeping into my scalp i.e. i can easily identify all the constituent chemicals and they all serve a purpose in cleaning my hair and leaving my scalp feeling good long after a wash</li>
    <li> Started using hemp products to help with a skin condition on my hands. It has made a tremendous difference so I&#x27;ll continue using this shampoo along with other products. Does the job, cleans my hair and pleasant smelling.</li>
    <li> Its a good base for the conditioner.  Hydrating, light.  Only drawback for me was strong scent.  It does remain in your hair for a couple days, the scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it twice since buying it, but I really like it and feel my hair is softer and healthier looking already. My housemate has told me there is a slippery residues after I use the shampoo and conditioner, so keep in mind you might need to rinse your tub or shower after.</li>
    <li> The bottle is white what I received is green.  Not what I ordered. The shampoo is not the same as what I ordered</li>
    <li> My scalp and hair have not felt or looked this good in so long.  Absolutely love this product and will not use any other shampoo from now on.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this shampoo.  It keeps your hair smelling great for a few days and your hair doesn&#x27;t feel greasy</li>
    <li> LOVE IT. SMELLS GREAT TOO.</li>
    <li> This product is great for dry air or oily. It took away a need to condition after shampooing.&lt;br /&gt;My boyfriend - loves it because it stopped his scalp aching.&lt;br /&gt;I will get it again..</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. My hair looks and feels much better after switching to it. Also, dandruff is never a problem. I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
    <li> love it, smells great</li>
    <li> This shampoo is fantastic! I like to only wash my hair maybe twice a week, and this stuff keeps my hair clean and oil-free for days. Love it!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t lather well, and it eventually dries your hair out. I would not recommend buying this shampoo. Not worth it even on sale.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews on this product before purchasing and the reviews for&lt;br /&gt;long hair were very inviting! I opened the plastic seal on this product... therefore I was unable to return it!!!!&lt;br /&gt; And before I went to use the Shampoo I put some in my hand and the smell was so strong&lt;br /&gt;of a sterile medical and plastic odor that I never even put it on my hair!&lt;br /&gt;Huge waste of money!!!!</li>
    <li> really like this product. I recommend</li>
    <li> i love the smell and it leaves my hair soft.</li>
    <li> Smells terrible - like a combination of laundry soap, cleaning solution and perfume. I tried it three times to see if the scent would grow on me - but nope - it is still terrible. What a waste of money!!!</li>
    <li> Really like this product; works well with my hair. Good balance and control. Hope they never discontinue.</li>
    <li> very good,love the fragance</li>
    <li> This is a joke, hydrating? My hair became so dry...&lt;br /&gt;Not as good as Alterna. My hair became very dry and dull after I use this shampoo and conditioner. yikes.</li>
    <li> Was surprised at how little shampoo it takes to make my hair lather up and feel clean. Great clean, fresh smell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure some people have great results with this, but this product was so drying my hair started to break off in chunks. I&#x27;ve bleached my hair platinum and not had my hair be as dry as it is now. Worst product I have ever used on my hair.</li>
    <li> excellent price, no shipping charges. this will last me at least 2 years.. maybe longer.&lt;br /&gt;smells great, good for your hair..love it</li>
    <li> Great shampoo with a wonderful smell. Leaves hair soft, conditioned and healthy looking. I&#x27;ve tried other shampoos and always come back. They are never as good.</li>
    <li> I love these Hempz products.  They are truly amazingly moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love how this shampoo and conditioner makes my hair shine and more manageable.  The smell is wonderful and my hair even smells like it the day after I wash it.</li>
    <li> I have intense scalp issues and I have struggled to battle the dandruff and itching all my life.  I have used ever sort of dandruff/dry scalp/hydrating shampoo you can imagine, prescription and not.  Due to genetics and the arid climate I live in, I felt that it was just going to be part of life for me.  Until I found this stuff!  Both the shampoo as well as the conditioner have totally transformed the look, feel, and make-up of my hair and scalp.  Within a month of regular use, my dandruff woes are almost completely gone!  I cannot express to you enough... If you have the same problems I did, you NEED THIS!</li>
    <li> The smell of this shampoo &amp; the conditioner that goes with it is so strong it made me sick to my stomach. It smells awful.</li>
    <li> My wife asked me to write this review and let people know that this is a manly smell but something that she can live with.  It has a definite minty feel when I use it.  I use this and the conditioner everyday and we went out of our way to get it. It is something you have to experience for yourself because it makes your hair feel light and keeps it fresh and clean all day.</li>
    <li> My daughters hair smells great for days, it shins and her curls just bounce while it still feels soft verse putting an additional product into it!</li>
    <li> Sally Beauty stopped carrying this product for some reason.  This stuff is the best, it smells amazing.  I have a house full of girls with long hair.  This stuff ROCKS!  Im thankful im able to purchase it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love this product! My whole family uses it and while I know there are better and more expensive Hemp based hair products out there... this one is perfect for my boys. It leaves their hair (and mine) nice and shiny and soft. I recommend buying this product to anyone! I have been purchasing and will continue to buy this shampoo as well as the conditioner.</li>
    <li> Fantastic strong scent, excellent moisturizing quality.....my husband&#x27;s hands felt baby soft after simply using this shampoo to wash his hair. We love it.</li>
    <li> Thought I was getting the Hempz brand. These made my scalp itch and I threw them away.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Thanks</li>
    <li> yes i would reconmend this product-great for your hair and it makes your hair smell good to&lt;br /&gt;had no problems with the shipment of the products-came in good condition</li>
    <li> Excellent product - easier to use (while in the shower) in the smaller bottle though. Transferring into smaller size for daily use.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the product very satisfied with it I would most definitely recommend the shampoo and lotion to anyone</li>
    <li> Made my hair shiny and cleaned also smells great &#x3D;]</li>
    <li> Good product, would buy again</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo. I&#x27;ve been using it for a while. It really does keep hair looking health and soft.</li>
    <li> Well there is no better judge of how it&#x27;s working then my wife&#x27;s opinion... She says she notices right out that my hair is looking much fuller, showing some curl and smells good...  I guess that&#x27;s a STATEMENT all in it&#x27;s self...  My hair is thin and been going for the last couple of years... so it looks like this is a new product in our home.</li>
    <li> Good price and a huge bottle but way too many things going on inside the stuff itself&lt;br /&gt;it got the job done but this stuff is NOT ORGANIC&lt;br /&gt;Just to let you know it made my hair soft and smooth but i like ORGANIC stuff which this is NOT&lt;br /&gt;But it is at a bargain of a price&lt;br /&gt;you decide&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW i prefer North American Hemp Co. &#x3D; These guys are ORGANIC as if you care or not</li>
    <li> I got this shampoo and conditioner at my local sallys beauty supply. But they recently stopped carrying it :(. First of all the smell is amazing! It reminds me of the aveda brand. Second, it really makes your hair feel clean and so soft! It adds shine and luster. The shampoo alone leaves your hair slighty moisturized but not that overly built up feeling. But when used with the conditioner my hair feels amazing. Definenetly my favorite shampoo ever!</li>
    <li> I have been using both the Shampoo and Conditioner for a year now and still find myself loving it more with every wash. It works wonders on my long thick wavy hair and the smell is nice and earthy, Love It!!! Definitely a holy grail product in my book.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite shampoo!! Smells so good!! (Or like my boyfriend says, &amp;#34;you smell like a hippie&amp;#34;)</li>
    <li> Works great for dry hair but again, it just smells &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; to me.  I like a clean smell but again, my hubby loves this and I will most likely order this again.</li>
    <li> Never buying again!! Thinned out my all ready thin hair. Washed hair in shower - make my whole body and scalp itch like crazy for hours! Does not smell good.</li>
    <li> Terrible purchase! Don&#x27;t buy! I wish I would have believed the neg reviews and IGNORED all pos reviews. My own fault! This shampoo and conditioner have the most awfull smell! Kind of like a man&#x27;s cheap horrible cologne. Definitely not feminine at all. So many reviews said it had a wonderful clean smell.....well maybe I got a different bottle than everyone else cause mine smell disgusting! I can&#x27;t stress this point enough. Also the conditioner is not at all smooth on your hair. It just mats up in it and I have short hair and could barely comb through it in the shower. I can&#x27;t imagine someone with l long hair dealing with it. I threw them away and ordered the real HEMPZ brand. Cost more money but totally worth it. They work and smell great!</li>
    <li> It smells good and the bottle is huge. My locs feel amazing after using this.</li>
    <li> My hair is ridiculously thin and way damaged from coloring, straightening, and blow drying for years. Since I&#x27;ve been using this for the past month or so, my hair fills thicker and it has a shine to it now. The smell is pretty overpowering at first, but it grew on me or toned down, I&#x27;m not sure which, but it&#x27;s much more tolerable now. I will keep buying this for sure.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, makes my hair look and smell amzaing</li>
    <li> I like it, smells good , good lather</li>
    <li> Has a nice, but strong smell.  Little too strong for my taste, but my husband is using it.</li>
    <li> Very good product.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Not hempz so don&#x27;t mix those brands up. Still a great product for any gender. Smells like a hair salon and leaves your hair super soft</li>
    <li> so far so good.. I tried it last night and i have to say im pretty impressed.. Left my hair feeling really soft.. The smell on the other hand is something I will have to get used to.</li>
    <li> I have a scalp problem and this shampoo is the only one I have found that does not cause my scalp to itch and is not a medicinal shampoo. Great product!!</li>
    <li> Great shampoo!  Very similar to the former hempz shampoo that is no longer available.  We will continue to buy!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo!  It not only feels silky when using it, but it leaves may hair feeling silky and shiny.  I&#x27;m all for hemp products - especially when they start being produced in the USA!</li>
