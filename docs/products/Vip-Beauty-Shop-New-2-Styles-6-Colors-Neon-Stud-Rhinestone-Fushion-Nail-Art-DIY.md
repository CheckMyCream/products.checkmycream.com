<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> When I got these they weren&#x27;t even neon! They were dark fall like colors. So upset! Never buying from this seller again!</li>
    <li> Wish they had the amount shown in the picture shown, it&#x27;s slightly deceiving. I&#x27;m excited to use them,  but can&#x27;t use much of them because there&#x27;s not many of them.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed in this product. The picture shows beautiful bright colored pieces but I recieved a bunch of faded pieces that may have once been bright and pretty but that is no longer the case. I really wanted this product for the bright pretty colors so I doubt i will use this product and I definitely would not order it again.</li>
    <li> No free gift as stated. Great color, poor misrepresentation of quantity.</li>
    <li> Crappy the reverse side is hollow so they have no material on the back to glue down to your nail</li>
    <li> These look so cute on the nail! I love them so much to add accents to my nail art.</li>
    <li> I wish I had checked reviews.  The package is nearly empty, and now I see it happened to many people, We can actually count there are only 93 bits. It is less than half what the photo shows.</li>
    <li> 4 stars cuz I like the colors and and squares &amp; circles.&lt;br /&gt;BUT NO &#x27;free gift&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;And there were NOT a lot in here AT ALL.&lt;br /&gt;Which is misleading and very disappointing.</li>
    <li> Very bright in color great size</li>
    <li> it not as much, as it look from the photo</li>
    <li> Not even close to the colors shown. My 10-year-old daughter bought these with her own money and was very disappointed when them came. Certainly not the neon colors as shown or described. They were standard colors: red, green, etc.</li>
    <li> Fun colors and shapes....</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t used it yet, but from my first impression their alright. Good for nail manicures details. plus their neon so it will make fun designs</li>
    <li> I do like this these, not quite exactly as full as the picture shows and a lot of green and hardly any blue. Not a big deal though considering the price was good!</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:fe957f7d4756f14d927942e264dc28a8]]Less studs than I expected. The pictures used in the description shows many studs and what arrived to me was no where in the same range. I do like the neon colors of these studs, and the size of each one. I also like the shapes, it really allows me to have fun with my nail designs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To apply these gems, I paint my nails first. I let them air dry for a minute or two and then I use a pair of tweezers to drop each stud carefully into place. Once I have a design in place I use a couple coats of top coat to really hold them on nicely, of course allowing the application to dry before moving to the next coating of clear nail polish. The clear polish really makes the nail and studs look pretty and shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never have problems with the studs getting stuck of clothing with the method I describe above. I wish more of each color was given, I feel as though the photos in description misrepresent the actual amount of product sent..I would of given five stars if not for that issue.</li>
    <li> Got exactly what&#x27;s in the picture.</li>
    <li> Very cute.  No free gift sent though.  But I do love the studs.</li>
    <li> CAME EARLY WHICH IS GREAT. THE AMOUNT RECEIVED IS NOT THE SAME AS DISPLAYED...THAT WAS NO SURPRISE, U GET MAYBE 1/3 OF WHAT IS SHOWN IN THE PICTURE AND THEY ARE SMALLER THAN EXPECTED BUT WILL MAKE DO. NOT A BAD PRODUCT FOR THE PRICE.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money false advertising</li>
    <li> They do wat they r made for very happy</li>
    <li> No blue circle though... Its okay. They are awesome</li>
    <li> Overall I do like these, but there are a few things you should know:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the picture the circular studs are way smaller than the squares. The ones I arrived are both the same size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are larger than I expected, much bigger than any silver/gold nail studs I have gotten before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine was considerably less full than the picture, there were maybe 10 of each kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are certainly worth the price and I can still make them work, just not exactly what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> cute and efficient and adds to the nail appearance</li>
    <li> Package arrived before estimated delivery date. Bright colors and good quality especially for the price.</li>
    <li> I got this wheel but it literally had 3 colors in it of red, pink, and orange and they were metallic not neon and none of the circle studs. Really disappointed.</li>
    <li> Come with some inside, not the same as the pic at all! It&#x27;s a fraud</li>
    <li> I loved the bright colors. The wheel was a bit smaller than what In had expected but nonetheless,  a great value for the price. I will definitely buy more in the future. Shipping was quick and I had no problems with seller.</li>
    <li> this purchase is a 2nd purchase of these.  1st purchase was packed full, i was very happy so ordered again...but 2nd order 2 of the square colors i only got 8 of, the other squares were between 12 and 18 pieces.  i got plenty of the round studs.  the colors are nice and bright</li>
    <li> As described. Took a little bit to get here but that&#x27;s understandable.</li>
    <li> Got the wrong set and never got it fixed.</li>
    <li> I really like these, but the paint chips off easily. Be sure to use top coat, and reapply after a few days. I don&#x27;t always have time, so, I ended up with silver studs on my nails, which, still looks fine.</li>
    <li> Not very impressed. Seems to Be very cheapyl made</li>
    <li> Super cute for the graffiti themed nails I had planned for a client.</li>
    <li> Quicker then expected... Daughter loves it</li>
    <li> The neon finish rubs off to  metaL within 1 week</li>
    <li> Very cool! Love them!</li>
    <li> Love these for my nail designs thanks for the great price..</li>
    <li> Love the colors. Bold and a nice pop of color to your mani and pedi. It&#x27;s cheaper to do your nails yourself if you have the patience.</li>
    <li> These are so cute and add a bright flare to your nails.</li>
    <li> These came in quickly.The colors are vibrant and the pieces are sturdy.</li>
    <li> These are awesome. Love the colors of the gems. They look great on my nails. May order more in the future.</li>
    <li> This is not as neon as it looks</li>
    <li> these Neon Studs are super!! I wish I had gotten 2 packages....Even though it&#x27;s getting to be winter time, the colors are going to be super for summer and spring...also a nice pick me up in the dull winter months.... SUPER DUPER Price for a great product. HIGHLY recommend these.</li>
    <li> There aren&#x27;t as many as in the picture, but I&#x27;m still very happy with this purchase :)</li>
    <li> I got what I asked for. I tryed them but they stayed on for only a few days.</li>
    <li> Very nice, I didnt expect much for the price ( your not gonna get as much as the pic but you&#x27;ll have enough to work with)</li>
    <li> The previous reveiw was absolutely correct, there are only half the studs in here, I&#x27;m going to guess 20-25 studs per color. However, the price and free shiping, I would totally buy this again. Expectations were greater than reality, reality is still better than the price.</li>
    <li> Product was exactly as pictured. There was an equal combo of squares and circles... each in different lovely neon colors. None had fallen out or into any other colors slots. so basically, it arrived in great condition &amp; was exactly what I ordered. They look great used as nail art too! I&#x27;m super happy with them!</li>
    <li> They look horrible. Very faded colors</li>
    <li> I love these, I just wish I had recieved more of the pink studs as there was obviously less than any of the other colors.</li>
    <li> The description says Neon!! only the pink was neon!! I got red, green, silver, gold and neon pink!! What a rip off...NOT HAPPY! Plus some of the studs were damaged..never again!</li>
    <li> perfect little neon colored metal shapes....less than the amount in the photo, but unique and there are  enough to do your nails over and over.</li>
    <li> Good job deliver and nice colors thanks</li>
    <li> Love the colors......package cameintacted no pieces were lost orot ofcontainer.....I get that along with little piecesI order such as the gems for the nails...happy this wasn&#x27;t one of them.</li>
    <li> Was supposed to be squares and circles in 6 different neon colors, but received stars, hearts and teardrops with a few circles and squares. If I wanted the other shapes I would have ordered something different.</li>
    <li> I was upset the picture posted is miss. Leading you don&#x27;t get that much plus. I didn&#x27;t get any neon pink in mine!!</li>
    <li> Been buying a lot of nail decorations lately and these are by far my favorite, love that they come with two styles both in all the colors! Will definitely buy these again when I run out!</li>
    <li> SUPER fast arrival! Cute studs for summer nail art. not as many or as bright as pic shows...but still worth the small price!</li>
    <li> Came exactly as pictured. There&#x27;s about 10 squares each color and about 24 circles each color. It also arrived way sooner than expected delivery date.</li>
    <li> I love the colorful studs and rounds for my nail art/manis.  Great colors.  Good size.  And they included a little pair of pink rhinestone heart earrings.  Coolness.  Arrived by estimated delivery date.</li>
    <li> Just like they are shown. .. Fast delivery</li>
    <li> I bought these to use for handmade cards and scrap booking.  Looks like Im going to have lots of fun.</li>
    <li> I ordered from ATM FASHION WORLD, received my order three weeks later (which is still earlier than the earliest projected delivery date.) The wheel looks pretty much exactly as pictured, except instead of the pink square studs I got two compartments of purple ones. I&#x27;m not too sad about it, as the purple ones will probably get more use. All the compartments are reasonably full. For $1.74 I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not get any sort of free gift, however.</li>
    <li> Great for nails designs. I love the colors. They are awesome summer colors. I will be buying more. And got free shipping</li>
    <li> I think I&#x27;m going to stop buying nail decoration wheels from Amazon--I always wind up with at least a few shapes that weren&#x27;t what was pictured. In all fairness, it does include green, yellow, orange, blue, and purple neon studs, but rather than the simple square/circle ones pictured here and what I wanted, you get a mix of teardrop shapes, stars, ovals, hearts, and far fewer square/circle studs. For some colors (orange and purple for me) you don&#x27;t even get two shape options and just have one little compartment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically if you want EXACTLY what&#x27;s pictured, just simple square and circle neon studs, you&#x27;re not going to get it, and you&#x27;ll be lucky if a color even has one of those two options. But if you don&#x27;t care what shape they come in or the variety of colors available and just want neon studs, however, these are fine.</li>
    <li> Working on designs for my customers.  I know they will love them once they see them.  Can&#x27;t wait to use.</li>
    <li> These gems arrived sooner than what I expected!!! upon examining the package I feel that they were shipped in a perfectly padded envelope to ensure delivery with no damage.  which I appreciate. when I went to use them on my first mani they stuck perfectly with simple top coat. the only reason I left one star off was due to  the studs color. on some of larger studs a few were worn . But for $1 + free shipping &#x3D; BUY!!!</li>
    <li> Ordered these after reading comments I was worried it would not be what I expected but it was and i love them! I have severeal in each slot to do my nails!</li>
    <li> The squares are too big for my nails. I use the circles on my toes. They are oddly flat and wide.</li>
    <li> These are awesome! Lots included in the wheel, the colors are very bright and vibrant! The only thing is I wish the bottoms were a tad flatter or something to make them stay on the nail a little better</li>
    <li> I like the product i dont use much but its still pretty and works great when I do use it</li>
    <li> there so cute and the colors are wonderful get buy just make sure to use nail glue so they dont fall off</li>
    <li> I love it this product isvery cute and I receive what I picture im really happy I will purchase this stud again!!!</li>
    <li> They come as full as they look, I can&#x27;t see the bottom on any compartment. Haven&#x27;t used them yet but will write more when I do. The squares are 3mm wide and the circles are 1.5mm wide. They don&#x27;t seem to be as high off the nail as a gem. As far as brightness, I will have to compare to my neon polish.</li>
    <li> grandaughter loves them</li>
    <li> Very cute and looks just like the picture also they shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> I did not recieve what was in the picture.. Its a very small wheel with not very many studs as in the picture. About 5-10 per color and shape of stud.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really happy with what I got...I was a little scared, when I ordered them because I had read some reviews saying that they didn&#x27;t get neon ones...but I did and now I can&#x27;t wait to use them in the summer for some fun nail art</li>
    <li> These are fantastic for any playful manicure! Adds a colorful punch to any design! Would be fun to do Pacman with the yellow dots!</li>
    <li> I am pleased on what I have received cause reading all the other comments I was very nervous if I was or wasn&#x27;t going to get the neon ones. Although I did get neon ones, but there not full. There would be about 20 studs in each.</li>
    <li> I bought these to have at my house so when my granddaughters came to visit they would have something to do.</li>
    <li> I love these! So fun so bright</li>
    <li> The colors are very vibrant, and the studs are nice and flat to attach to your nails without fear of them chipping off the next day.  There are lots of studs in each slot.  The only issue I had was that some of the studs were just floating around in the container, and were in the wrong slots.  That is pretty easily fixed though.</li>
    <li> excellent for nail art and steal for the price</li>
    <li> Love it I would buy from them again</li>
    <li> Great quality &amp; will definitely order again in the future ^^</li>
    <li> Beautiful neon colors amazing how they glow.</li>
    <li> Saw these rhinestones on an Instagram page so I looked for them on amazon and found them! They look so beautiful with neon cop</li>
    <li> I love them! I almost never got these either because I thought they were gonna big and as Ive said in other reviews I dont like big bulky things on my nails but they are much smaller than I thought they were gonna be and Im so glad I got them!</li>
    <li> I received my order well before the estimated delivery date and love the neon colors. I didn&#x27;t realize the wheel was the gift so I contacted the seller and not only were they quick to respond but also very professional and respectful. I did of course feel embarrassed about not realizing the wheel was the gift, but glad that they clarified it in a respectful manner. Love my neon studs! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time, was as described, very happy buyer! (:</li>
    <li> I really like them and loved the colors</li>
    <li> Very nice would recommend</li>
    <li> Super cute for neon lovers lots of shapes and sizes and colors to make any neon nail pop love that they are hollow on the inside unlike rhinestones they have dome shape the stay put better haven&#x27;t lost one !</li>
    <li> Studs came faster than estimated, and are very cute, but there were barely any in the wheel, far fewer than what is pictured. Most of the colors don&#x27;t even have enough to put one on each nail, so that was very disappointing.</li>
    <li> I got what I saw in the pic!</li>
    <li> got it was in good shape love it happy to use it and much more of it thank so much</li>
    <li> I got not what was pictured or described!! not neon!!  i got red, yellow, clear, black and white circles. Black, red, white, and brown squares. And white, clear, pink and brown stars. i spent money on them, it&#x27;s not what i ordered and i was fairly disappointed when i opened it up.  Apparently from reading the rest of the reviews I am not alone.  Sucky!!!!!</li>
    <li> SUPER SMALL. Only 1 size.but the color are neon</li>
    <li> I ordered these thinking I was going to get what is in the picture. I really wanted some neon colors that pop. Really disapointed.</li>
    <li> Beautiful  and very colorful</li>
    <li> They aren&#x27;t as bright as the picture. I still like them but wish they were much more neon.</li>
    <li> Nice on colors! Fast on delivery!!</li>
    <li> Love the studs but I thought I was getting the neon ones and that isn&#x27;t what came in the mail today :(</li>
    <li> They were not neon. And very few in the package also the shapes were different.</li>
    <li> Cheap and exactly as described!</li>
    <li> The colors when I received them were just like the picture, vivid and bright,  however, the size are smaller and the wheel is half the size of the one featured! Also it wasn&#x27;t much in them either. .</li>
    <li> my daughter bought this and was expecting to get the neon studs but what she got is a lot less than that. she didnt get any neon colors, she got stars and the wheel is absolutly tiny, so much so that she cant even do a full set of nails because there are only about 15 in each compartment.</li>
    <li> These are a good product with great colors but definitely didn&#x27;t recieve a free gift as advertised so that was kind of a let down :(</li>
    <li> I got the wrong colors no neon just different shades of copper gold and black. The amount I received of each color was ample though.</li>
    <li> This adds lots of fun to your nails.</li>
    <li> Cheap price cheap product</li>
    <li> I really like this studs they r really pretty. Which can be used in many things not only with nails but it&#x27;s just that the studs r to small but other than that I liked them</li>
    <li> Received the item sooner than what I expected which was great but disappointed when I opened that package. Shows in the picture a full slid of colors and many different snaps and colors. When I recived the item it was nearly empty. The colors I did receive were very beautiful neon but too few in the container. !</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS THE COLORS ARE VERY BRIGHT</li>
    <li> just came in today! way ahead of schedule! Bright colors and great quality! not to big and not to small, just perfect!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to get this wheel, with the neon studs! But unfortunately I received a whole different wheel with different tiny gold words. TERRIBLE!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Ok. The &amp;#34;neon&amp;#34; colors aren&#x27;t as bright and vibrant as suggested in the pictures. That being said, I do like the gems in the set, I just wish they had that bright, eye-catching look that&#x27;s advertised. The item arrived WAY before estimated, which was great. The approximate delivery was February 28-March 5th, and I received the item on February 9th. That was awesome. I order tons of gems and rhinestones from China because I like to &amp;#34;bedazzle&amp;#34; things and I&#x27;m considering opening an etsy shop with all of the awesome things I make. I have a gel nail polish kit at home (the kind that includes an LED light to cure the polish, etc) and I place the gems with a regular top coat to whatever it is I&#x27;m decorating, then apply a clear gel top coat and cure the item under the light, and voila! Beautiful things that I get constant compliments on. I realize I&#x27;m going off on a tangent here.... Anywho, I&#x27;ve attached a picture of the advertised item next to what I actually received. You&#x27;ll definitely notice the difference. Even with my somewhat dissatisfaction with this, I&#x27;m going to continue to order gems and whatnot from China because you really, really can&#x27;t beat the prices, so I&#x27;m willing to take the risk. I hope this review has been helpful.</li>
    <li> all I received where the squares, in a bag. they threw all of the colors together in the same bag at that, I did not receive any circles at all...very disappointed... false advertisement much. Would not recommend this to anyone...and I want my circles</li>
    <li> I love the colors and shapes of these. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that they do not lay flat on the nail unless you have long nails. I also wish they were a touch smaller (even though they are pretty small already).</li>
    <li> This product arrived way ahead of schedule which is a plus however the package was open when it arrived and all the studs were mixed together and all over the place. I had to spend two hours with a pair of tweezers rearranging them into the appropriate compartments. I also noticed that many of the studs are misshapen to the point where they won&#x27;t stick to a nail. But ... you get what you pay for and for the price this isn&#x27;t a bad buy. The ones that won&#x27;t stick to nails I&#x27;ll re-purpose for another project.</li>
    <li> great product!  love the neon colors!</li>
    <li> Very good product .. It adds a cute touch on the nails love how you can do many different designs with the rhinestones .. Great price , great colors .. I totally recommend it</li>
    <li> Gorgeous &amp; fun! Do not let the picture fool you though, there arent quite as many in these wheels as it suggests</li>
    <li> Waited well over two months to get the wrong item!!!</li>
    <li> I love these studs, they are my go to nail art when I want a noticeable design.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I wanted...</li>
    <li> love them! they came early and were the perfect size~!</li>
    <li> Very cute for nail art.</li>
    <li> I am loving these!  They are the perfect size and great colors.</li>
    <li> Exactly what is pictured . Took extremely long to get product</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t receive the correct item.</li>
    <li> my little girl loves the bright colors and the shapes are good. very worth the price</li>
    <li> These are hard to work with.</li>
    <li> I did not receive NEON rhinestones. After reading other reviews it appears that this has happened to several others!</li>
    <li> no neon at all just metal stars, circles, and squares different colors very t&#x27;d off about it.</li>
    <li> The colors were not neon.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I expected which was NEON colors! Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> The colors are great. However, I don&#x27;t think I received the quantity as indicated in the description. They were all mixed up in the wheel to.</li>
    <li> The color fades when gel top coat is applied.  Good for regular manis</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OKAY.. in the picture it looks like you are getting a lot of beads but they are not that many... picture is deceiving.. lol  Product is good tho... no complains...</li>
    <li> Item exactly as described. Good value. Will order again.</li>
    <li> I DID NOT RECEIVE WHAT I ORDERED. I thought I was paying for NEON RAINBOW nail studs, but instead got GOLD, SILVER, BROWN, BLACK AND WHITE ones. If that&#x27;s what I wanted I would have clicked on &amp;#34;Neutral Metal Nail Studs&amp;#34; or whatever. (For some reason the set I got also included star shapes.) These were too cheap to bother with a refund or return, so I used them anyway. AAAAAAAND... more disappointment. They may look curved, but they do NOT follow the curve of your nail, especially the star ones. My hair got caught under the edges and it&#x27;s all-around annoying. After multiple clear coats I managed to seal the studs all the way around, but they looked funny and lasted less than a week.&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR: Don&#x27;t buy these.</li>
    <li> Bold and bright ea dry put on</li>
    <li> very cute, they are perfect for summer and I get lots of compliments, and they go great with the neon polish. I will be ordering more and I recommend this.</li>
    <li> fast shipping product as described</li>
    <li> Came a few days early:) which I loved! They are amazing! Easy to pick up</li>
    <li> Even more beautiful in person!!</li>
    <li> Nice selection. Bright colors.</li>
    <li> Got it in less than 2 weeks. Very cute and bright.</li>
    <li> these are super cool and easy to use... love them</li>
    <li> Very bad, wheel Is very small and it&#x27;s not even full...so much empty space.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just a false good pic representing the cheap product.</li>
    <li> These are very nice small but not too small the colors are so bright &amp; fun will chase away the winter blues I love the little rhinestones too but didn&#x27;t receive my free pair of earrings but it still gets 5 stars anyway.</li>
    <li> Colors are cute but I&#x27;m not too happy with the amount that comes in the pack. I feel like this was a rip off. The picture shows one thing &amp; they send you less than what they show.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very upset.... I didn&#x27;t get any neon ones. I got red, silver, gold &amp; black.</li>
    <li> This is not the product i received, i got my package this morning and it is a nail art wheel but it&#x27;s not neon or squares and circles. i got red, yellow, clear, black and white circles. Black, red, white, and brown squares. And white, clear, purple and brown stars. Although i will probably be using these as i spent money on them, it&#x27;s not what i ordered and i was fairly disappointed when i opened it up.</li>
    <li> I got a bunch of rusty lookinglooking crappy studs that I will never use.</li>
    <li> Love the colors easy to glue on ! Perfect shapes all my customers loved it!</li>
    <li> Love them. Exactly what I was looking for. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Terrible advertisement.  None of the rhinestones I received are neon!  I got black, red, and gold.  THAT&#x27;S IT!  Very disappointed in this product!</li>
    <li> Both shapes in all colors were included, but the picture is misleading. There are definitely only about 20 of each color. I also didn&#x27;t receive any of the blue circles. I realize these are cheap, but I don&#x27;t like to be mislead.</li>
    <li> These were a mess when we received them and do not stay separated in the container the way they should</li>
    <li> I bought this product bc it&#x27;s different from other nail art designs. The product came in earlier than scheduled. I have gotten many compliments on the nail art designs. I would recommend this product and seller.</li>
    <li> Studs are just as described in the advertisement, the neon colors are brilliantly bright and do not fade once top coat is applied...Perfect!</li>
    <li> The picture is very misleading, There is no where near that many in the package. You have about enough to use one color only once. Other than that the colors look good and I received mine in a reasonable amout of time.</li>
    <li> Thank you. I received my replacement stones in the neon colors!&lt;br /&gt;Very happy now!</li>
    <li> Good product for a good price</li>
    <li> this is not what u get u get one they randomly pick from a box i wanted neon i got black white and gold stars and circles</li>
    <li> I received a completely different item. I got red, gold and white studs instead of neon. I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Quicker then expected... Daughter loves it</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t receive what was pictured I got the different colors and size but only like 4-5 of each not near as much as shown.</li>
    <li> i love doing my nails and these are a perfect edition to my nail blinging collection. it looked just a little less packed than advertised and i didn&#x27;t get the gift. i thouht it was gonna take way longer but i got in like 12 days. the round ones were a little smaller than the squares and i got the advertised colors. a steal deal at this price, wish i got 2, guess im gonna have to order one more :)</li>
    <li> Didnt get neon! I got metallic</li>
    <li> Well... I guess all I can say is these are not neon... At all... In fact, they are just gems... Stars and squares... No where in this discription does it say state stars in the package. Luckily,  I kind of like them and will settle for the $1 or $2 I paid for it.</li>
    <li> Love my items and I am happy that it came in a case and not in a bag. the colors are popping.</li>
    <li> these were a neat item neon they were pretty</li>
    <li> Very cute studs. Fun for summer/spring. I recieved exactly what was&lt;br /&gt;Pictured! Took a little while to get but i wasnt in a hurry</li>
    <li> stones are vary bright</li>
    <li> I got them for a present for a friend &amp; i got them 3 days before recommened! Very happy !</li>
    <li> total rip-off!! I wanted these neon colors and got something totally different.. soo dissapointed</li>
    <li> Good variation included in the case, fast shipping, will use again.</li>
    <li> My daughter has really gotten into nail art this year.  This kit has been very well used since she got it.  She has enjoyed working with all the variety of colors of tiny stones.  Great little kit for the price!</li>
    <li> It is not as full as it appears in the picture, not as neon either. There&#x27;s barely 10 of each color in what I received. For the price it&#x27;s acceptable, but it&#x27;s still false advertising.</li>
    <li> The color chips off easily and they do not stay on the nail! Very bad</li>
    <li> These are as bright neon and colorful as pictured.  Arrived in about 2 weeks.  They are about 2mm size and perfect for my smaller nails. There are way more round studs than square, but well worth the price and I would definitely be buying again.</li>
    <li> These are alright but when I got them the top of the case was loose and they was all mixed up. But also I put them on my nails as soon as I got them and after 2 days of wearing them I noticed the paint chipped off of them. I even had top coat over them to keep my nail polish from chipping. I didn&#x27;t get all those colors either. So I don&#x27;t know.</li>
    <li> they are pritty...but dome fell out of the box</li>
    <li> It was ok... The studs where kinda of all over the place. There was no free gift which was disappointing- false advertising much? lol</li>
    <li> Good size for my small fingers and the colors really pop. These were a must have for my nail art collection.</li>
    <li> I love pretty much everything about these aside from one thing. I got 2 slots of the round pink ones, and lost a slot of the blue squares, which I was most looking forward to. Other than that they work well.</li>
    <li> LOVE these... I just wish more came in the wheel. But the price to quantity actually really evens out.</li>
    <li> Bright color, it has different shapes and they fit good in the nail.</li>
    <li> I bought these and I did not got the same colors that are in the picture. Instead of the bright neon colors I got gold,red, black, and silver.</li>
    <li> LOVE these neon studs! I have clients galore who are looking for the brightness of neons with warmer weather coming...I&#x27;ll be adding these beauties to LOTS of nails this summer!</li>
    <li> Container was broken. Very little decals to  begin with. Lost many in the mail. Guess you get what you pay for with this item.</li>
    <li> 2 of each color.  Hot pink, green, lime, orange, purple and blue.  They come in two shapes: round and square.  Nice container to keep it organized.  Many style possibilities.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know if they would be to big and stick out to much but I live them I really love the neon colors I would definitely recommend this product, I&#x27;m going to order more you can&#x27;t beat the price, and they came in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> excellent and beautiful product</li>
    <li> Love the size that it came in and will DEFFFFFinitely Buy again!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This product by goyestore was awesome!!!!! It came  on august 10th when it wasn&#x27;t supposed to come from august 22 to September 10!!!! the each came with at least 30 and they stick to your nails easily! There colors are also very bright!!</li>
    <li> The wheel I received looks exactly like the picture. Round studs are ~2mm across, square studs are about 3mm. Bright colors and a generous amount in the wheel.</li>
    <li> i love it came exactly like the image took a while to come but its the perfect neon studs for someone whos looking for it thank you</li>
    <li> Love these. They are so cute!</li>
    <li> Completly wrong. Ordered NEON circles and squares got dull colored black, brown, red and pink random shapes. Not happy waste of a wait and money.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re cute.. I don&#x27;t really use them because they seem juvenile</li>
    <li> These are way cute and way cheaper than you&#x27;d find at the store. I inlay them in gel nails and they are flat enough they don&#x27;t stick up.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product thinking that they where supposed to be neon but i didn&#x27;t receive any neon studs Mine are in black, white, silver, gold, and red. I wanted some brightly colored studs to add a pop of color and i instead received dull boring colors.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure I got these and I think I love them!</li>
    <li> Some of the studs separate into 2. Be careful when apply on nails.</li>
    <li> Great for nail art cool neon colors</li>
    <li> Vibrant colors!!  Just as pictured!  Lots of rhinestones!!</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m giving this a 3 stars, for starters i wont complain about price or shipping speed.. came in a decent amount of time and of course it is cheap.. but at the same time i guess you get what you pay for. First there was not nearly as many as the picture shown, it would be okay to put an actual amount of what you&#x27;ll get because for under 2$ its still okay, but its the false part i hate. Secondly i did not receive any blue circles in any section leaving me very upset and cheated, because i payed for an item that i basically did not receive. I&#x27;m not sure if i was just unlucky but being someone who does nails for others i really needed this.</li>
    <li> Yes and I love them!!!</li>
    <li> awesome they arrived before the time they said the color is as they say and easy to use and very colorful love it...</li>
    <li> Really enjoyed these fun colors and shapes but not as full as the picture suggests. Worth the money but not worth the wait.</li>
    <li> The wheel isn&#x27;t as large or as full as I was expecting. The product image is a little misleading. For the price and free shipping, I suppose what I got is good enough, though I wish the product I received was more accurate to the product shown. I did get a nice variety of colors. The size of the round studs is also a little larger than I expected, but I can work with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product was shipped and arrived sooner than estimated, which is very nice.</li>
    <li> on my nails  right now</li>
    <li> Great(sarcasm)...my review wasn&#x27;t approved until I said something positive.</li>
    <li> Like others I was expecting a little more than 16 stones of each. But shipping was right on time. It was also a decent price with free shipping for what I received.</li>
    <li> I love these. They look amazing with matte top coat. Only negative is the colors will rub off stud. So if you like to keep your nail color for a week or more be prepared for disappointment.</li>
    <li> Exactly as some of the others have said, received colors that were not as described. None of them were neon!</li>
    <li> Great colors and I like the variety in shapes.</li>
    <li> Received so very few of these. Some compartments had less than 10 studs!</li>
    <li> my customers loved them!!! Way to go Amazon!</li>
