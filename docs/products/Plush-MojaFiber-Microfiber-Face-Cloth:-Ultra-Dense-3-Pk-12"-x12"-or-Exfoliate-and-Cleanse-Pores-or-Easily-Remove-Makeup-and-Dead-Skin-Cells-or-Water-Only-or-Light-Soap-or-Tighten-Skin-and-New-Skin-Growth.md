      <li>The quality looks and feels much better than Norwex.  </li>
      <li>Wash beautifully and very soft.  </li>
      <li>face wash frequently, and these are great for removal of products like scrubs and face masks.  </li>
      <li>They are softer and more plush than the microfiber towels I clean with.</li>
      <li>They work fine on the rest of my body though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It cleans the makeup right off my face and its gentle &amp; pleasant to use</li>

      <li>do have special washing instructions-</li>
      <li>I decided to instead try using the cloths with soap to cleanse my body, but instead of causing the soap to lather, the cloths just absorbed the soap.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t come right off mind you, but I&#x27;ve found it always takes patience to not damage your eyes and these cloths still require you to take your time.</li>
      <li>With these it takes a quick soak with warm water then some gentle rubbing with tiny strokes.</li>
      <li>I used this after using my regular face cleanser and was very surprised at how much more make up came off!</li>
      <li>Will definitely order more.</li>
      <li>love these, and am ordering a second set...</li>
      <li>Leave your skin feeling soft and clean.</li>
      <li>These towels are like a super soft washcloth.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend them!</li>
      <li>I really like the exfoliating part of the cloth.  </li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t really scrub with these.</li>
      <li>There are much much cheaper options for microfiber house-cleaning rags and cloths out there than these, though.</li>
      <li>/&gt;So for face, baby, and drying fast- 5 stars.</li>
      <li>My ingrown hairs are really bothering me and seem to have increased since I&#x27;ve tried using these on my body.</li>
      <li>/&gt;So for face, baby, and drying fast- 5 stars.</li>
      <li>love how they instantly fill up with water yet ring out so completely.</li>

      <li>Fast Delivery and clear directions on care.</li>
      <li>my eyes are very sensitive</li>
      <li>They are professional quality and would work great for spas as hot or cold face towels or used as part of the cleansing routine for professional facials.</li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m ok with a little residue as I do a proper scrub in the AM.&lt;br /&gt;I spray with a little stain remover before throwing in the wash and they come out clean!</li>
      <li>I bought these cloths (expecting them to be very soft and gentle) for the purpose of cleansing the make-up off of my face with a facial cleanser or makeup remover.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using them for about 3 weeks now, with and without soap, and on my 4 year old son, with and without soap.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really surprised at the reviewer that says they irritate the skin...</li>
      <li>Incredibly soft and removed makeup like a dream.</li>
      <li>I do use all natural makeup-</li>
      <li>have soft water-&lt;br /&gt;Soap</li>
      <li>I like the soft feel they have.</li>
      <li>I barely touched the cloth to a bar soap and got enough foam to wash my whole face, neck and ears.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Now, washing an adult body is a different thing.</li>
      <li>Tried these instead of &amp;#34;the other brand&amp;#34; and so far my Wife loves them!!</li>
      <li>I figured the skin would at least hold a little more oil because of the lack of scrub</li>

    <li> I put these cloths in each guest bathroom.  Everyone loves them.  They are professional quality and would work great for spas as hot or cold face towels or used as part of the cleansing routine for professional facials.</li>
    <li> Use them everyday.  They are very soft and effective in washing my face.</li>
    <li> Best invention ever. Removes all my make up!</li>
    <li> Fast Delivery and clear directions on care.</li>
    <li> Best facial washcloth ever. Incredibly soft and removed makeup like a dream. Much better than Norwex, which I thought I was in love with. Not anymore!</li>
    <li> These things are pretty awesome. I&#x27;ve been using them for about 3 weeks now, with and without soap, and on my 4 year old son, with and without soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mostly use them without soap like the description suggests they should be. I&#x27;m really surprised at the reviewer that says they irritate the skin... You can&#x27;t really scrub with these. I&#x27;ve never been able to remove eye makeup without a cleanser + cloth before. With these it takes a quick soak with warm water then some gentle rubbing with tiny strokes. It doesn&#x27;t come right off mind you, but I&#x27;ve found it always takes patience to not damage your eyes and these cloths still require you to take your time. I do use all natural makeup- my eyes are very sensitive and I cannot wear most mascara brands- so that may be a factor in the ease of removal, but it removes my eyeliner and mascara without damage to my eye lashes or any noticeable swelling.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t wear much other makeup besides under eye concealer and cheek and eye highlighter and it seems to get all that off too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son loves these, or he just hates traditional clothes. Bath time was always a struggle with him before, he would always try to dodge me, now he just lets me rub away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have soft water-&lt;br /&gt;Soap lathers like crazy on these things too. I barely touched the cloth to a bar soap and got enough foam to wash my whole face, neck and ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, washing an adult body is a different thing. If you&#x27;re used to exfoliation and you want these for your body, these probably aren&#x27;t for you. I get ingrown hairs on my legs and like to get a good scrub on them and these just can&#x27;t do it. My ingrown hairs are really bothering me and seem to have increased since I&#x27;ve tried using these on my body. I figured the skin would at least hold a little more oil because of the lack of scrub but my legs are still dry as hell after washing too- even without soap. So I&#x27;ll have to have a traditional separate cloth for that purpose. They work fine on the rest of my body though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how they instantly fill up with water yet ring out so completely. The really do dry well. I&#x27;m so paranoid about mold so that&#x27;s a big plus for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do have special washing instructions- wash separately (eek non- eco friendly tiny load?!) and some drying temperature restrictions. So that can be annoying if you only have 1 pack. I&#x27;m about to put another 2 sets on my baby wish-list cuz we&#x27;re expecting and I plan to use these instead of those baby wash cloths- these are definitely softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So for face, baby, and drying fast- 5 stars. For adult body and complicated washing - 3 stars.ine on the rest of my body though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how they instantly fill up with water yet ring out so completely.

    <li> Tried these instead of &amp;#34;the other brand&amp;#34; and so far my Wife loves them!! Will definitely order more.</li>
    <li> Love these washcloths. They are the best. They clean well even without soap. Leave your skin feeling soft and clean.</li>
    <li> The MojaWorks Microfiber Cloth is AMAZING!  I do not know how they work but they work. Removes all my makeup with just water! I rinse the cloth and hang to dry. I purchased the set of three, however, I need to reorder.  My 2 daughters helped themselves to my 2 extra. I was raving about how well they worked and they loved them, too!  Off they went......home with them:)</li>
    <li> I just love these microfiber face cloths!  I like to use the &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; face wash frequently, and these are great for removal of products like scrubs and face masks.  Wash beautifully and very soft.  I&#x27;m ordering more of these.</li>
    <li> The Plush Microfiber Body/Face cloth works just great.  I like the soft feel they have.</li>
    <li> These are great!  I really like the exfoliating part of the cloth.  It&#x27;s like getting a facial in the shower every day.  It also holds your bath wash very well, so you can use less!  Lathers well. Only one thing I don&#x27;t like -- you have to wash them separately.</li>
    <li> I hate washing my face. Usually I rub On some cleanser and tissue off or use cotton balls/pads. Incredibly wasteful and inefficient. These towels are like a super soft washcloth. They are softer and more plush than the microfiber towels I clean with. They get off a lot of my makeup (with just water)but not all of it. I&#x27;m ok with a little residue as I do a proper scrub in the AM.&lt;br /&gt;I spray with a little stain remover before throwing in the wash and they come out clean!</li>
    <li> Wow! I used this after using my regular face cleanser and was very surprised at how much more make up came off!</li>
    <li> Quality is excellent! So much cheaper than Norwex--but just as nice, if not nicer.</li>
    <li> It cleans the makeup right off my face and its gentle &amp; pleasant to use</li>
    <li> The quality of these cloths is exceptional! I would buy them again.</li>
    <li> love these, and am ordering a second set...face feels so incredibly clean...</li>
    <li> I bought these cloths (expecting them to be very soft and gentle) for the purpose of cleansing the make-up off of my face with a facial cleanser or makeup remover. I was looking for something less wasteful than disposable make-up removing wipes and cotton pads/balls for make-up removal. The texture was too rough, though. It was very irritating to my face&#x27;s sensitive skin. My eyelids became swollen because they were so irritated by these cloths. I decided to instead try using the cloths with soap to cleanse my body, but instead of causing the soap to lather, the cloths just absorbed the soap. While they did not irritate the skin of my body, because they absorbed all the soap, they were completely useless as a body rag. I will use these cloths as cleaning rags since they are useless as face or body cloths. There are much much cheaper options for microfiber house-cleaning rags and cloths out there than these, though. Therefore, I do not recommend purchasing these cloths.</li>
    <li> These are way better than the Norwex body pack!!!  The quality looks and feels much better than Norwex.  I highly recommend them!</li>
