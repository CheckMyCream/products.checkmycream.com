      <li>I can&#x27;t vouch for this, but my teeth remain feeling smooth to my tongue even after eating sweets.  </li>
      <li>If you have incredibly sensitive teeth, however, this may not be a good choice.</li>
      <li>Leaves a minty fresh breath and cleans your teeth!</li>
      <li>I got a full sized sample for free in exchange for my review</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t found a better toothpaste, and I&#x27;ve tried many, many different kinds.</li>
      <li>are clean and smoth</li>
      <li>My mouth has never felt so clean.</li>
      <li>My mouth always feels super clean and fresh after using this!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d suspect it would not stand up very well after more than half-used.  </li>
      <li>Love my new toothpaste and the fresh from the dentist feel after every brush!</li>
      <li>My teeth feel clean, and my mouth feels fresh after use.</li>
      <li>and I wake with a clean fresh mouth in the morning</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall I can tell my teeth feel super clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This gets my teeth clean and leaves them feeling clean the whole day.</li>
      <li>but I thought if it works, it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
      <li>Leaves your mouth minty fresh</li>
      <li>My breath stays nice and fresh all day long!</li>
      <li>If you use it normally, it will probably keep your teeth clean.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s job very well!</li>
      <li>- there are more and much more serious than staining.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Believe this toothpaste is great for people who have serious teeth problems, but for normal teeth with no issues recommend another toothpaste.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s taste is subtle and pleasant.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure why a company would think it&#x27;s OK for an oral rinse to stain teeth!  </li>
      <li>However, I feel that I&#x27;ll be as pleased with it as I am with all the other Crest Pro-Health toothpastes.</li>
      <li>It has a grittiness to it that I like -- reminds me of the gritty stuff a dentist or dental hygienist uses to clean your teeth.  </li>
      <li>Again, this paste contains plenty of abrasives, so if you teeth feel &amp;#34;slimy&amp;#34; after use, it&#x27;s actually the feeling of a clean surface coated with saliva.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This particular tube was part of my subscribe &amp; save, so  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m getting older</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
      <li>I only used Crest Pro-Health Clinical Plaque Control Fresh Mint Toothpaste for over a month</li>
      <li>have two new bottles of the rinse and two new tubes of the paste that are going into the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>In conclusion:  at least this is worth a try if any of the above seems appealing.</li>
      <li>morning I searched for review of this paste and found so many other people are also having same effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
      <li>The dentist was not overly concerned and he was able to get the stains off in my normal teeth cleaning, but a few weeks after the cleaning, back came the stains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I stopped using it for awhile and returned to it to verify that this toothpaste was responsible, and it definitely is.  </li>
      <li>And my sibling prefers sensitive gums choice.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it at night as I use another acid-protection toothpaste in the morning, but no matter how much I rinse after brushing at night</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this toothpaste. My teeth feel clean, and my mouth feels fresh after use. I haven&#x27;t found a better toothpaste, and I&#x27;ve tried many, many different kinds. Some people in the reviews comment that this toothpaste leaves a film in their mouths. That hasn&#x27;t been my experience. However, I usually drink some water after brushing.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Subscribe &amp; Save item. Good price with a clipped coupon. This gets my teeth clean and leaves them feeling clean the whole day.</li>
    <li> Leaves your mouth minty fresh but I found it dried my mouth out too much. Not enough spit in your mouth causes bad breath. After I stopped using this and switched to something natural, my morning breath was much less because my mouth could produce spit during the night.</li>
    <li> This does prevent plaque buildup. You must stay hydrated and rinse thoroughly to avoid dry mouth and irritation to gums. This may cause a minor sore throat if you don&#x27;t rinse well and drink water. Stannous fluoride causes stains. My teeth were stained from this toothpaste but my dental hygienist removed them and recommended I try an electric toothbrush. My mouth has never felt so clean.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste with a great toothbrush feels amazing! My mouth always feels super clean and fresh after using this! Not too strong in flavor, either!! Yeah, Crest!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of toothpastes, but I always go back to Crest Pro-Health!  This particular tube was part of my subscribe &amp; save, so  I haven&#x27;t used it yet.  However, I feel that I&#x27;ll be as pleased with it as I am with all the other Crest Pro-Health toothpastes.</li>
    <li> Bought this Crest Pro-Health Plaque Control paste last week from Wal-mart.&lt;br /&gt;Start using it last weekend (Saturday night, Oct 25). On Sunday I start having tooth ache and I thought I caught cold or some infection in the tooth/gum that had to take Advil.&lt;br /&gt;I also notice skin inside of my mouth and lip was piling off. I was using it at night (in the morning I use Pro-Enamel paste).&lt;br /&gt;Last night my wife told me her teethes are also hurting. Only thing different we did was using this paste and we realized this paste is causing all the pain and extra sensitivity to our teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This morning I searched for review of this paste and found so many other people are also having same effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How a well known company like Crest sell a paste that causes pain and sensitivity to teeth?</li>
    <li> How can you go wrong for $1???</li>
    <li> Crest pro health oral product line is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;Suggest you try out all varieties and find out which works for each individual in your household.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the 50+ product line. And my sibling prefers sensitive gums choice.&lt;br /&gt;Either way these products are for good dental care and they work.</li>
    <li> My husband has gum disease and this is recommended by our dentist and we love it! It tastes great and it freshens your breathe as well.</li>
    <li> Leaves a minty fresh breath and cleans your teeth!</li>
    <li> Have I noticed anything different in my daily experience using this toothpaste? No. It&#x27;s toothpaste, not &amp;#34;magically fix your years of dental hygienic neglect&amp;#34; toothpaste. If you use it normally, it will probably keep your teeth clean.</li>
    <li> Brilliant this type should be the standard type of fluride.</li>
    <li> Only toothpaste for me, though it is expensive.</li>
    <li> Brighter whiter righter</li>
    <li> Experience a more healthy, beautiful smile with #CrestProHealth products  I got a full sized sample for free in exchange for my review please know the opinions are 100% my own! I LOVED it! Crest does it&#x27;s job very well! And love that I was able To try it for free and give my opinion and share for all my Friends and family! Love my new toothpaste and the fresh from the dentist feel after every brush! My breath stays nice and fresh all day long! Love being able to smile with confidence!!!  -I&#x27;m a member of Smiley360.com, where I qualify to try brands for free in exchange for sharing my authentic feedback.</li>
    <li> Have been using the Crest Pro-Health Clinical brand for the past year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did not have no tarter or plaque build up before, and brush twice daily. Went into the dentist today and due to the toothpaste it had caused Visible Dental Biofilm. Basically a color discoloration on the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spoke to the dentist who stated there were several other patients who had experenced the same issue with this specific toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Believe this toothpaste is great for people who have serious teeth problems, but for normal teeth with no issues recommend another toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Crest products never disappoint</li>
    <li> Great toothpaste to protect my teeth.</li>
    <li> I read the other reviews and decided to write one.  It seems like one review was for a different product.  Then another was saying there was a problem with the product being used at night.  I use the product morning and night.  I&#x27;ve used it for more than 3 years now.  Does it control plaque?  I can&#x27;t vouch for this, but my teeth remain feeling smooth to my tongue even after eating sweets.  About the product:  It&#x27;s taste is subtle and pleasant.  It has a grittiness to it that I like -- reminds me of the gritty stuff a dentist or dental hygienist uses to clean your teeth.  It seems to do a great job.  Lastly the packaging.  It has a lid/cap on a hinge that snaps off and on.  No more struggling with a screw cap -- to get it off or on.  This cap you can flick open with the thumb.  The opening and closing can be managed with one hand.  The flat lid/cap I suppose will let you stand the tube upright, but I don&#x27;t care about that.  I&#x27;d suspect it would not stand up very well after more than half-used.  Anyway. . .I don&#x27;t know why all toothpastes don&#x27;t come with an option for this type of packaging.  In conclusion:  at least this is worth a try if any of the above seems appealing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Clinical plaque control for over a year now because I am happy with the results. This is quite an abrasive paste. The taste is a subdued mint as well, which I prefer. I have noticed that my teeth contain less plaque at the end of the day than when using other pastes. Again, this paste contains plenty of abrasives, so if you teeth feel &amp;#34;slimy&amp;#34; after use, it&#x27;s actually the feeling of a clean surface coated with saliva.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for users complaining of peeling, pain, and other results, I believe this may be from underlying oral health issues. This product contains no active ingredients different than any other FDA approve toothpaste. If you have incredibly sensitive teeth, however, this may not be a good choice. But try it yourself.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had a cavity in a few years now....</li>
    <li> So I had a problem with Tartar and Plaque. I don&#x27;t love flossing, although it can be satisfying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked this up instead of the Aquafresh crap I was using before. Dentist used to rag on me about weak gums and plaque build up. Last checkup, no complaints. Takes care of my gums, destroys plaque. Awesome.</li>
    <li> The cap gets messy, cant really see a solution for it.  Toothpaste is good.</li>
    <li> great product love the way my mouth feels after words. leaves it nice and clean feeling.&lt;br /&gt;teeth are clean and smoth</li>
    <li> I like all that this toothpaste claims to do, and bought it for those various benefits. I&#x27;ve only been using it at night as I use another acid-protection toothpaste in the morning, but no matter how much I rinse after brushing at night I wake up with thick, almost strand-like pieces of film on my teeth and gums from the toothpaste. I stopped using it for awhile and returned to it to verify that this toothpaste was responsible, and it definitely is.  Unfortunately, the gross film is not worth Crest&#x27;s stated benefits.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what all of the negative reviews are about. This toothpaste is the best product I have used so far. If you do have the gingivitis this product is a good product in order to reverse gingivitis. there has not been any side effects to using this product. I highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I let my daughters pick out their own toothpaste so I&#x27;ve used more brands and types than I can count. This time my 9 yo grabbed this tube only in the 5.8 ounce size. I tried it and love it. I only used Crest Pro-Health Clinical Plaque Control Fresh Mint Toothpaste for over a month and I wake with a clean fresh mouth in the morning, any puffiness in my gums has gone away, and after brushing my mouth never felt cleaner. This toothpaste does what it claims to do and out of all the different toothpastes I&#x27;ve tried, this one tastes the best.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it is all that it is cracked up to be when it comes to removing tartar buildup.</li>
    <li> I have had a terrible experience which I believe is connected to Crest Pro-Health Clinical Rinse and Crest Pro-Health Clinical Toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was using another rinse and decided to try Crest Pro-Health Clinical Rinse.  The taste is horrible (you feel like you&#x27;re rinsing your mouth with Windex) and your mouth will burn afterwards but I thought if it works, it&#x27;s worth it.  Then I started to develop brown stains on the edges of my teeth.  I&#x27;m getting older so I attributed this to age.  The dentist was not overly concerned and he was able to get the stains off in my normal teeth cleaning, but a few weeks after the cleaning, back came the stains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worried about the stains, I decided to step up my game and try Crest Pro-Health Clinical toothpaste.  THEN I started to develop serious gum irritation and tooth pain.  My gums are raw, I feel like my gums are receding, and my teeth often hurt so much I have to take pain medication.  I&#x27;m miserable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worried about my symptoms, I looked on the internet and found that Crest Pro-Health Clinical products were the culprit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Procter &amp; Gamble fully acknowledges that the rinse WILL cause the brown staining, although this warning is nowhere on the bottle.  I&#x27;m not sure why a company would think it&#x27;s OK for an oral rinse to stain teeth!  And that&#x27;s just one side affect - there are more and much more serious than staining.  I think I got off easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then the internet is flooded with reports of the toothpaste causing serious gum irritation and teeth pain.  I don&#x27;t think this gum irritation is temporary, I think I&#x27;ve permanently damaged my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have two new bottles of the rinse and two new tubes of the paste that are going into the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are awful, awful products.  Research them, and you&#x27;ll see.</li>
    <li> It has little sand particles, that &amp;#34;exfoliate&amp;#34;. I guess it helps to remove plaque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it helps a little with sensitive teeth too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I can tell my teeth feel super clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste is ok.</li>
    <li> great toothpaste and great price!</li>
