      <li>Bottle last for 2 moths + and very affordable.</li>
      <li>This was the first lotion that I found that worked for my dry skin.</li>

      <li>Nature&#x27;s Gate papaya lotion moisturizes skin so well and has a clean, subtle smell.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Favorite lotion.  Really moisturizes!</li>
    <li> This lotion is a new favorite of mine because it moisturizes well and smells wonderful, kind of citrusy. It has a creamy and slightly sticky consistency, similar to Bath and Body Works lotions but not as thick. It goes on a little more silky than some Bath and Body Works lotions, which can be very thick and slightly sticky. However I think this Nature&#x27;s Gate lotion has healthier ingredients than Bath and Body Works lotions. It feels more natural.</li>
    <li> It rejuvenates your skin giving a sensation of hydration and softness.  This product is for any kind of skin and can be used for sensitive skin, it is paraben free and I really feel my skin smooth, very happy with the product and I got 10 dollars discount in my next order and 10 more for a friend.</li>
    <li> Great product, reliable seller. Bought several times from same.</li>
    <li> This is just okay.  Nothing spectacular about it.  My son has extra dry skin and it didn&#x27;t really do anything to improve it.</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot. It smells DIVINE! It definitely moisturizes, but I find that it leaves my face rather oily after the other ingredients have absorbed into my skin. I already have combination skin (and suffered from severe acne as an adolescent) so this  along with the price relative to the amount of product you get (it&#x27;s a nice size but still, $12 I feel should get you a bigger bottle) weighs this products rating for me. Other than that, it&#x27;s not bad. I probably will shop around for something that isn&#x27;t as oil and the price is something I can live with- but there&#x27;s also a possibility I might re-buy another time or two. It&#x27;s really hit or slightly miss.</li>
    <li> GREAT LOTION, KEEPS SKIN MOIST ALL DAY.</li>
    <li> Got this as a sample and I&#x27;m buying it because it left my skin sssssssuper soft. This is not a face cream so I will not attempt to use it for that but great as a body lotion. The papaya smells great (subtle fruity scent) nothing like bath and body works lotions which have strong frangance.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this lotion! I have been searching a lotion with a lasting moisturizer for years. I live in a very dry climate, and one application lasts all day! Has a wonderful scent as well.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer and remains on throughout the day. Not oily..which is a good thing. Hate Whole Foods stopped carrying it!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion!  Feels great and smells great!</li>
    <li> The good news is that it leaves my skin silky and glowing! The bad news is that the sesame oil fragrance pretty much drowns out the other fragrances, and sesame is not the fragrance I want to have lingering on my body. Sesame chicken,anyone? I really hope they eliminate or noticeably tone down the sesame, because I&#x27;d love to buy it again if they did.</li>
    <li> My wife gets itchy dry skin often and uses this lotion to combat it.  She buys it over and over again, so she&#x27;s very happy with it.  If her arms could reach around to her back to put lotion there, I wouldn&#x27;t have had to get her a [[ASIN:B0067ARLTU Bear Claw Back Scratcher]] ;-)</li>
    <li> Great lotion. Not greasy, smelling nice and doing good job on my face.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this lotion! I have a condition called KP and nothing has ever helped me as much as this lotion has. The only issue I have with it, is the scent doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> Love the lotion....arrived with a broken pump though!  Luckily, I still had the previous one in the recycle bin.  Product was packaged in a larger box with minimal packing material.</li>
    <li> This is very good lotion for the entire body!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Thank you for making organic lotion for the skin</li>
    <li> Great body and face moisturizer. Applies easily on skin. It doesn&#x27;t have a thick and sticky texture. Bottle last for 2 moths + and very affordable.</li>
    <li> This lotion smells wonderful and really quenches the skin. It goes on light but moisturizes my skin just as well as a thicker, greasier product. I highly recommend Nature&#x27;s Gate.</li>
    <li> I have fallen in love with Nature&#x27;s Gate Lotion.  Living in MN my skin gets terribly dry and this lotion does the trick.  I am officially a fan of Nature&#x27;s Gate and will continue to purchase for years to come.</li>
    <li> This was the first lotion that I found that worked for my dry skin. It keeps my skin moisturized, soft, smooth, greaseless, and itch free. I even use it on my face without breakouts. It smells wonderful. I love it so much that I gift it to people. Whenever I visit people, I usually end up leaving the bottle. Whenever I share it, people usually ask about how to get it. Love it!!</li>
    <li> My skin never gets dry or itchy when I use this lotion.  It contains all natural ingredients and smells so good!  When my store ran out, I found it on Amazon.  I don&#x27;t want to use anything else.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I actually keep this next to my bed at night. Not greasy and not too thick. I love that it&#x27;s vegan, it smells great and it makes you feel clean and your skin feels happy.</li>
    <li> We have purchased this product in Canada for years, and it is great. We bought this bottle through this US seller, and my wife&#x27;s face broke out at first use. Obviously there is something in this version that is not in the Canadian version. Not happy at all, and plan to return.</li>
    <li> Awesome lotion..love the smell</li>
    <li> Nature&#x27;s Gate papaya lotion moisturizes skin so well and has a clean, subtle smell. Cruelty free, it has no weird ingredients to worry about. Nature&#x27;s Gate gets it right with this moisturizing product.</li>
    <li> I purchase this item because of the price and because my family loves this lotion. So no complaints from me, great product!</li>
    <li> I have been using Nature&#x27;s Gate Papaya lotion for a while now.  I really do love it.  Buying it online saved me the gas to go to the health food store for it.</li>
