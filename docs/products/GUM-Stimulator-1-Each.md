      <li>This GUM Stimulator is a very important part of my dental hygiene.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m satisfied with the results.</li>
      <li>Incidentally, it was a dental hygienist who recommended these many years ago.</li>
      <li>Glad to have this implement to massage my gums and keep gums healthy.</li>
      <li>We have been using this product for many years and are pleased with the price, the quality, and the customer service</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m glad I can order them on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>works great for times when don&#x27;t feel like using waterpik, gentle, very pleased, thanks</li>
      <li>It is so easy to use and gets rid of food particles at the gum line.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s been an easy habit to stick with.</li>
      <li>Great deal and a better buy than getting replacement heads that don&#x27;t fit properly.</li>
      <li>teeth where I cannot fit dental floss.</li>
      <li>These are prefect to clean gums.</li>
      <li>I actually found it more effective to floss in regards to improving my gum health.</li>
      <li>It actually feels good doing it</li>
      <li>As a precaution, if you have moderate to severe gum disease, it may not be a good idea to massage your gums before you talk to your dentist.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I find the refill tips fine but find the one&#x27;s that come with the handle much more durable and lasting.</li>
      <li>&amp;#34;A recent study showed that massaging the gums with a rubber tip (found at the other end of some tooth brushes) is actually more effective in reducing germ count than a regimen of antibiotics!</li>

      <li>My dentist recommended and gave me the first gum stimulator 5 years ago.</li>
      <li>My dentist gave me my first gum stimulator.</li>
      <li>My dentist recommended and gave me the first gum stimulator 5 years ago.</li>
      <li>In comparing the percentage of bacteria between those who massage their gums with the rubber tip and those who took antibiotics, the rubber tipping group actually had slightly more reduction in bacterial count.</li>
      <li>They thrive in dark spaces between the gum and the roots of the teeth called gum &amp;#34;pockets.&amp;#34; Brushing and flossing are effective in part because oxygen is introduced into these pockets.</li>
      <li>Really.</li>
      <li>I really like these and credit</li>
      <li>so I really appreciate finding them via Amazon.</li>
      <li>Oral bacteria are &amp;#34;anaerobic,&amp;#34; meaning that they cannot live in the presence of oxygen.</li>
      <li>These are hard to find and make my dental care-keeping gums healthy</li>
      <li>The replaced tip will last longer much longer.</li>
      <li>We moved and no stores here stock them that I&#x27;ve been in so far.</li>
      <li>Gently press the rubber tip upward if you are massaging the upper arch, and downward if dealing with the lower arch.</li>
      <li>I have nice firm pink gums now.</li>
      <li>They have a long enough handle to reach into the back of the mouth easily.</li>
      <li>I usually use the simulator at night, between teeth to clean out debris and trace around and below the gum line for plaque removal.</li>
      <li>Vigorous massaging of the gums with the rubber tip introduces fresh air into these dead spaces.</li>
      <li>Once one tip wears out, use the new one for plaque removal only and use the worn one to massage in between teeth only.</li>
      <li>The tip is pretty &amp;#34;sharp&amp;#34; so be very careful when using and ONLY use as directed by your dentist.  </li>

    <li> Glad to have this implement to massage my gums and keep gums healthy.</li>
    <li> Great deal and a better buy than getting replacement heads that don&#x27;t fit properly.</li>
    <li> Have been using for years, excellent for massaging your gums.</li>
    <li> These are hard to find and make my dental care-keeping gums healthy</li>
    <li> My dentist gave me my first gum stimulator. I now use it regularly and decided I needed a few to keep in my car, office, ... Hence, I bought the pack of 3.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;A recent study showed that massaging the gums with a rubber tip (found at the other end of some tooth brushes) is actually more effective in reducing germ count than a regimen of antibiotics! Bacteria that cause gum disease are like vampires. They must live in the dark. Oral bacteria are &amp;#34;anaerobic,&amp;#34; meaning that they cannot live in the presence of oxygen. They thrive in dark spaces between the gum and the roots of the teeth called gum &amp;#34;pockets.&amp;#34; Brushing and flossing are effective in part because oxygen is introduced into these pockets. Vigorous massaging of the gums with the rubber tip introduces fresh air into these dead spaces. In comparing the percentage of bacteria between those who massage their gums with the rubber tip and those who took antibiotics, the rubber tipping group actually had slightly more reduction in bacterial count. Both groups brushed and floss their teeth during the experiment.&lt;br /&gt;The additional benefit of massaging your gums with the rubber tip is that plaque and cellular fluids are flushed out and circulation in the gums is improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not to say that you should only massage your gums, and not brush and floss your teeth. In fact you should only massage your gums after your have thoroughly brushed and flossed your teeth. As a precaution, if you have moderate to severe gum disease, it may not be a good idea to massage your gums before you talk to your dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is how you can massage your gums: Grasp the handle firmly in your hand and place the rubber tip between the spaces between two teeth. Point the rubber tip toward the center of the teeth. Gently press the rubber tip upward if you are massaging the upper arch, and downward if dealing with the lower arch. If you encounter bleeding from the gums, you are either massaging too hard, or you have a gum condition that should be checked by your dentist. Continue to massage every space between the teeth for 10 to 15 seconds. &amp;#34; USC Schol of Dentistry&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the Gum Butler Gum Stimulator for over 5 years, and I would not be without it.

    <li> Very good for teeth cleaning. I bought 3 . Two for my teenagers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for a long time.  Lately I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding them in stores.  I&#x27;m glad I can order them on Amazon.  I really like these and credit the improvement of my gums with these Gum Stimulators.  Incidentally, it was a dental hygienist who recommended these many years ago.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I wish I would have started using it years ago.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time and as described. We have been using this product for many years and are pleased with the price, the quality, and the customer service</li>
    <li> Very good product, exactly as described. Helps keep the dentist off my back! I use it after flossing and brushing to find anything that was left behind and now when i go in for my cleaning, the dentist finds almost nothing to scrape off and my gums are happier too.</li>
    <li> it does remove plaque that even floss and water pik does not get</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s see. Tainted baby milk. Dead pigs floating through the Yangtze River.&lt;br /&gt;Am I going to stick something made in China (no pun intended) into MY MOUTH?&lt;br /&gt;NO WAY - it&#x27;s probably cancerous and un-hygenic.&lt;br /&gt;Bought this instead.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001FWXT4Q Oral B End Tufted Denture Toothbrush Count]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMMEDIATELY threw this away.</li>
    <li> Replacement for what I have used for years.</li>
    <li> I purchase these because I did not realize you could just purchase the tips to when needing replacement. These are prefect to clean gums. I will eventually use them as I travel quite a bit so having these works for me.</li>
    <li> These things are wonderful! I don&#x27;t actually massage my gums with them, I use them sort-of as toothpicks. they&#x27;re great!</li>
    <li> Perfect classic rubber gum massagers</li>
    <li> It does what it is supposed to do.  Remove particles from in between your teeth. It does not completely eliminate flossing, but it helps.</li>
    <li> Have always liked the Gum Stimulator as both a gum and teeth cleaning aid and it lives up to its reputation of being a quality product.&lt;br /&gt;Was delighted to find them again.  We moved and no stores here stock them that I&#x27;ve been in so far.</li>
    <li> I am so impressed on how effective this tool is. My gums have never been healthier. I use to suffer from dark swollen bleeding gums but not anymore. I have nice firm pink gums now. I usually use the simulator at night, between teeth to clean out debris and trace around and below the gum line for plaque removal. I also use it to massage the gums between the teeth. It actually feels good doing it so it&#x27;s been an easy habit to stick with. I prefer this over flossing which I&#x27;m not good at. I actually found it more effective to floss in regards to improving my gum health.Whether it&#x27;s a replacement for floss is debatable but I&#x27;m satisfied with the results. I wake up with fresher breath because of all the plaque removal so that&#x27;s a bonus. A helpful Tip. Buy two handles. Once one tip wears out, use the new one for plaque removal only and use the worn one to massage in between teeth only. The replaced tip will last longer much longer. I find the refill tips fine but find the one&#x27;s that come with the handle much more durable and lasting. Shouldn&#x27;t be a difference but I find that there is.  You&#x27;d probably save money buying the rule refill this though. Never been more impressed by a product and am thankful to my hygienist for telling me about it and giving me my first one.</li>
    <li> Keeps my Dentist happy.</li>
    <li> This awesome. Have used this before. Great results</li>
    <li> learn how to use these and take care</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s dentist recommended them and they&#x27;re great!</li>
    <li> always great for good oral care.</li>
    <li> My husband uses these to keep any problems with his dental health away.  Helps keeps gums stimulated.  Wonderful product.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommends that I rub my gums to help keep them healthy between visits.  As I travel a lot I looked at the local drug store to pick a few spares for travel, etc... HARD to find.  Therefore I ordered these from Amazon.  The tip is pretty &amp;#34;sharp&amp;#34; so be very careful when using and ONLY use as directed by your dentist.  You actually cause harm if not used correctly.</li>
    <li> This GUM Stimulator is a very important part of my dental hygiene. And they can be difficult to find so I really appreciate finding them via Amazon. It is so easy to use and gets rid of food particles at the gum line. I use it after brushing and am amazed at what it removes that brushing did not remove. I keep one in each bathroom, the car and in my purse. Don&#x27;t like being without it.</li>
    <li> works great for times when don&#x27;t feel like using waterpik, gentle, very pleased, thanks</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended that I use these at my senior age to strengthen the gums and they work.</li>
    <li> I have used these stimulators for many years. I currently have 5 or 6 of these things in various rooms around the house. They are great!  I use them mostly in the space between my back teeth and my wisdom teeth where I cannot fit dental floss. I also use them around and between other teeth to remove various particles. They have a long enough handle to reach into the back of the mouth easily. They are not meant to be disposable, which I like. They last for years. I usually lose them before they ever wear out. They are great to use as a gum stimulator. Use one while watching TV. It&#x27;s a great way to help get healthier gums while relaxing.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. My dentist told me about the Gum Stimulator years ago...this brand...and it is still the best. I have almost a whole mouth of caps which can be very irritating, and these save my gums. Really. Hard to find where I live, so very glad I found them on Amazon.</li>
