      <li>Now I&#x27;m going to have to buy more from somewhere else</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t ask for better.</li>

      <li>They are as exactly described and look.</li>
      <li>Belly button rings can get pretty pricey</li>
      <li>They arent cheap looking at all and the balls dont fall out easy like other belly button rings ive had.</li>
      <li>These are pretty but smaller than my original piece</li>
      <li>I will probably only put a different one in when I loose or break one, but it is nice to know I have more in my drawer.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>so I had to get use to the new size.  </li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
      <li>But two of them came in with a missing diamond, other than that they were good.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sensitive to nickel alloys, and cheaper jewelry is a gamble.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m bummed because they are much too long for me.</li>

<li> Arrived on time but half of them are missing the stones on the bottom.</li>
<li> Unbelievable  </li>
<li> They&#x27;re dull.</li>
<li> slightly disappointed as 3/10 had rhinestones missing</li>

    <li> Unbelievable  I got a pack of ten great quality belly button rings for the price of one at the mall. Super happy. I will probably only put a different one in when I loose or break one, but it is nice to know I have more in my drawer. Can&#x27;t ask for better. Recommend.</li>
    <li> These are pretty but smaller than my original piece so I had to get use to the new size.  I wasn&#x27;t sure what size I had to begin with so it was no one&#x27;s fault but mine.  I am still able to wear them so it&#x27;s all good.</li>
    <li> The colors weren&#x27;t the same and most of the stones fell out in shipping. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Belly button rings can get pretty pricey so when i found these, i was pretty excited. They arent cheap looking at all and the balls dont fall out easy like other belly button rings ive had. Very pleased</li>
    <li> Not all of the colors were as bright as the picture, but still a great buy!</li>
    <li> Good quality, great deal for the price!!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time but half of them are missing the stones on the bottom. They were in the bag so I guess they can be super glued back in very unhappy</li>
    <li> really good ones, I bought them for my girlfriend and she loved it</li>
    <li> Great price for the quantity.. All gems were intact.</li>
    <li> All of them seem to be fine and I am able to untwist the pieces unlike what other reviewers have experienced. I have had one in for about 2 weeks and no pieces have fallen off.</li>
    <li> Great deal for what you&#x27;re getting. I didn&#x27;t experience loose gem as others had mentioned and the colors are bright.</li>
    <li> I received these from a friend of mine for a present and I love them!! there bright colors just as pictured and not dull in anyway..I am so happy to have so many to choose from:) What can I say..I have amazing friends:)</li>
    <li> Not all of the colors were as bright as the picture, but still a great buy!</li>
    <li> slightly disappointed as 3/10 had rhinestones missing</li>
    <li> When I received them (past the expected arrival date) they didn&#x27;t look at all like they do in the picture. They&#x27;re dull. And half of the jems had fallen out of the rings when I got them. Wouldn&#x27;t buy this</li>
    <li> These are cute but they are definitely not 3/8. More like 1/2. I measured them. I&#x27;m bummed because they are much too long for me. Now I&#x27;m going to have to buy more from somewhere else and hopefully those will be the correct size.</li>
    <li> These look great. All the gems were there. And good quality.</li>
    <li> Got these way earlier then expected... Very Nice</li>
    <li> 8 of them came out great. But two of them came in with a missing diamond, other than that they were good.</li>
    <li> The belly button rings were just as described.</li>
    <li> They are as exactly described and look. 2 of them were very hard to unscrew at first, but I just used an oven mit with grip and got them undone. I&#x27;m away at college and always out running around so I wanted cheap rings that I wouldn&#x27;t mind losing. They are well worth the $6</li>
    <li> Sent exactly what it shows.</li>
    <li> Amazing quality for the price, took a while to ship though</li>
    <li> colors were not as depicted and some of the gems were lose</li>
    <li> They are great for the price.  Now what am I going to do with all these belly rings?  I popped one in the day the package arrived and I havent changed it out since.  No irritation.  Sturdy.  Just like the pic.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my wife &amp; she loves them</li>
    <li> Great value! You can&#x27;t ask for more than that! The colors sparkle and you can mix and match :)</li>
    <li> Steel was good, but the gems (colored part of the belly ring) were not in place. They wobbled and was no assembled correctly. Still pretty and good, just an error in the build of it.</li>
    <li> I love them... All stones in place and good quality too. Definitely worth the $7.00.  I just have to decide which color to rock!!</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised! I&#x27;m sensitive to nickel alloys, and cheaper jewelry is a gamble. For $10, I figured why not? AND THEY ARE GREAT! Absolutely no irritation, I can wear these for weeks with no issues!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is I wish there were a larger variety of colors in the pack. I will never wear about four of these...but I would have loved a yellow one.</li>
