      <li>One of my most luxurious fragrences yet!</li>
      <li>Roadster Sport is a pleasant and refreshing scent for men.</li>
      <li>It is absolutely one of the best men&#x27;s fragrances I have ever smelled.  </li>
      <li>excellent fragrance is durable and very special.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Good working natural spray, good bottle cap, good box!</li>
      <li>Excellent packaging, good looking bottle, and the product will last a while (6 hr by my calculations)...</li>
      <li>delicious duration of 6 to 7 hours good projection and fixing a special smell classic</li>
      <li>Nice frangance, but not so strong.</li>
      <li>One of the most pronounced notes can be found in the opening, which is the orange mandarin.</li>
      <li>I really love the smell though</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve long been a big supporter of Amazon and feel they generally do a good job and have more than fair policies.</li>
      <li>So clean.  </li>
      <li>I was looking for something that would smell citrus like with a good lasting scent.  </li>
      <li>It maintains the spicy aroma that made the original edt appealing, yet it isn&#x27;t as strong, which actually works well.</li>
      <li>I think this note in particular gives it that crisp, refreshing, slighty fruity vibe.</li>
      <li>The original Roadster is certainly stronger in those areas.</li>
      <li>&quot; does not l know their scents right.</li>
      <li>First time my son use it.  </li>
      <li>I recommend it to anyone interested in purchasing it</li>
      <li>It has a flowery fresh opening that slowly changes to just a nice fresh smell that lasts 5-6 hours.</li>
      <li>This edt is classified as a leather/ tobacco fragrance, though it&#x27;s non-offensive like certain fragrances in that category.</li>
      <li>Fast Delivery.  </li>
      <li>Fast shipping too.</li>
      <li>very dissapointed...</li>
      <li>He is very please .</li>
      <li>I have been using Cartier Roadster and Roadster Sport along with many (80 colognes) other colgones</li>
      <li>Great smell for casual everday use...</li>
      <li>They warn it may not be available with 1-2 day shipping due to it being &amp;#34;hazardous&amp;#34; but do not add that you cannot return it.</li>
      <li>Love the scent of the roadster sport, if you like lemongrass with a little bit of vanilla/mint then this is the cologne for you!</li>
      <li>It has been my signature scent for the past year and does get many compliments.</li>
      <li>These colgones are real and the same as what we buy at the retail stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Tried one small spray and the initial scent is pretty good but after a few minutes it turns WAY to feminine for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Says is a soft fragance and last all day.</li>
      <li>Hardly ever wear it bottle is almost full still.</li>
      <li>I have purchased before this one and very good fragance, but this time the fragance very bad not last , I am sure what is false, I trust because was selling by Amazon</li>
      <li>Thanks to Amazon, the price is less expansive than the dept store.</li>
      <li>People have confused this with &amp;#34;Polo Black&amp;#34;, I personally don&#x27;t own polo black, but I will because I like this.  </li>

<li> doesnt last very long on my skin</li>

<li> It dries down to a soft an subtle spicy/woodsy base, that is noticably pleasant.</li>
<li> /&gt;I&#x27;m even more disappointed in Amazon.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a little descret and people don&#x27;t notice until close to me, then they can&#x27;t get away.</li>
<li> Not your usual men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
<li> Bought this on a recommendation and have to say I&#x27;m pretty disappointed in it.</li>
<li> Usually wears out one hour after putting it on...  </li>
<li> what can I say other than I keep getting disappointed...</li>
<li> Projection and longevity are both questionable, as they appear a bit weak on my skin.</li>
<li> but I am disappointed.</li>
<li> /&gt;Shipping is terrible, but I will give  five star to seller.&lt;br /</li>

    <li> Roadster Sport is a pleasant and refreshing scent for men. This edt is classified as a leather/ tobacco fragrance, though it&#x27;s non-offensive like certain fragrances in that category. One of the most pronounced notes can be found in the opening, which is the orange mandarin. I think this note in particular gives it that crisp, refreshing, slighty fruity vibe. It maintains the spicy aroma that made the original edt appealing, yet it isn&#x27;t as strong, which actually works well. It dries down to a soft an subtle spicy/woodsy base, that is noticably pleasant. Projection and longevity are both questionable, as they appear a bit weak on my skin. The original Roadster is certainly stronger in those areas. So for that reason I can only give this one 4 stars, instead of 5.</li>
    <li> Nice frangance, but not so strong.</li>
    <li> I have to say this one is the best of the best. It smells different than other colognes i&#x27;m owning. I received a lot of compliment today when i wore it to the park. Thanks to Amazon, the price is less expansive than the dept store. Once again, if you like light scent, I recommend Roadster Sport.</li>
    <li> Good stuff i bought it before..</li>
    <li> excellent article, very practical, very fast modern yy. From all points of view is excellent I recommend it to anyone interested in purchasing it</li>
    <li> received in good condition</li>
    <li> I was looking for something that would smell citrus like with a good lasting scent.  Enter this Cartier fragrance.  Excellent packaging, good looking bottle, and the product will last a while (6 hr by my calculations)... Still as you know if you use if often it will last longer. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> what can I say other than I keep getting disappointed...manufacturers need to quit putting out colognes that do not last...what is the point if you have to keep spraying over and over?  I really love the smell though</li>
    <li> excellent fragrance is durable and very special.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend</li>
    <li> Bought this on a recommendation and have to say I&#x27;m pretty disappointed in it. Tried one small spray and the initial scent is pretty good but after a few minutes it turns WAY to feminine for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m even more disappointed in Amazon. I&#x27;ve long been a big supporter of Amazon and feel they generally do a good job and have more than fair policies. That said I went to return this cologne and come to find out they do not accept returns on it because it is &amp;#34;hazardous&amp;#34;. NO WHERE in the description on this does it say they do not accept returns on this product. They warn it may not be available with 1-2 day shipping due to it being &amp;#34;hazardous&amp;#34; but do not add that you cannot return it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know but this scent smells so good.  I bought it for myself and everyone comments on the beautiful scent!  I am female.</li>
    <li> The best a man can get. One of the best colognes I own.</li>
    <li> I have purchased before this one and very good fragance, but this time the fragance very bad not last , I am sure what is false, I trust because was selling by Amazon but I am disappointed.</li>
    <li> Fast Delivery.  Great cologne.</li>
    <li> People have confused this with &amp;#34;Polo Black&amp;#34;, I personally don&#x27;t own polo black, but I will because I like this.  It&#x27;s a little descret and people don&#x27;t notice until close to me, then they can&#x27;t get away.</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne from Nordstrom&#x27;s and loved the lingering scent.  I would there to say that what I got was counterfeit.  Usually wears out one hour after putting it on...  I just didn&#x27;t have time to return it but very dissapointed... Hardly ever wear it bottle is almost full still.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Great... thanks.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Awesome cologne. Great smell. Fast shipping too.</li>
    <li> delicious duration of 6 to 7 hours good projection and fixing a special smell classic</li>
    <li> Wonderful scent! Good working natural spray, good bottle cap, good box! Now and ever it will be my favorite fragrance!</li>
    <li> I presume that the perfume is great because of &amp;#34; CARTIER&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt; I have not received Cartier perfume but they are refund my money back.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping is terrible, but I will give  five star to seller.&lt;br /&gt; I would like to recommend this seller and product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this fragrance for my son for Christmas.  It is absolutely one of the best men&#x27;s fragrances I have ever smelled.  So clean.  Not your usual men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
    <li> Ok I want to first say that for everyone the for some reason orders colognes online and then complains that their product is \\&quot;FAKE\\&quot; does not l know their scents right. I have been using Cartier Roadster and Roadster Sport along with many (80 colognes) other colgones and I have yet to receive a \\&quot;FAKE\\&quot; one. These colgones are real and the same as what we buy at the retail stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as this Roadster sport, this scent is a very nice and non offending. It has been my signature scent for the past year and does get many compliments. It has a flowery fresh opening that slowly changes to just a nice fresh smell that lasts 5-6 hours. It can be worn anytime of the year. Very nice overall fragrance.</li>
    <li> First time my son use it.  He had tried it on an excellent store.  He is very please . Says is a soft fragance and last all day.</li>
    <li> One of my most luxurious fragrences yet! Love the scent of the roadster sport, if you like lemongrass with a little bit of vanilla/mint then this is the cologne for you!</li>
    <li> Great smell for casual everday use...doesnt last very long on my skin but everyone is different.</li>
    <li> Excellent! But this is very personal!</li>
