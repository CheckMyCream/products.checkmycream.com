      <li>This is an excellent product for those with a permanent orthodontic retainer.</li>
      <li>It is great!</li>
      <li>The best floss on the market.</li>
      <li>The best floss</li>
      <li>Seems she&#x27;s picky about what she lets her kids use and was looking for the best price for these.</li>
      <li>best dental floss ever</li>
      <li>This is a great product!!</li>
      <li>Hands-down the best dental floss I have ever found.</li>
      <li>It does, indeed, do a very good job of cleaning: I have tried it after summertime pig-outs of corn on the cob, and lots of, lots of blueberries.  </li>
      <li>Great product.  </li>
      <li>She&#x27;s happy with the purchase from what I hear.</li>
      <li>The floss itself is great.</li>
      <li>I think it works great, and I am switching to this floss from the Glide I have used forever.  </li>
      <li>Great price savings and convenient to purchase in bulk</li>
      <li>This stuff works great.  </li>
      <li>I have lots of dental issues, so I need a good floss.</li>
      <li>price was good.</li>
      <li>But it helps keep it in place on your fingers, and it grabs particles (you know those pesky popcorn kernels) between your teeth &amp; gums like magic!</li>
      <li>This floss is so amazing I had to write a review, although I did not get it on Amazon.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon for the great price!</li>
      <li>Very strong and stretchable.</li>
      <li>This floss doesn&#x27;t seem to break very easily, and it goes between the teeth</li>
      <li>My dentist recommended this floss and it is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>I was able to floss so quickly &amp; efficiently, it was great.</li>
      <li>It slides very smoothly -- better than any others I have used.</li>
      <li>My dentist recommended this floss because she said it cleans better with its &amp;#34;jagged&amp;#34; edge over the waxes flosses.  </li>
      <li>It is fantastic!</li>
      <li>I sure don&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>I love this floss.  </li>
      <li>sure.  </li>
      <li>My wife and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s even better than the Easy Slide; It stretches, goes through the tightest areas and never catches or shreds.</li>
      <li>really missed Reach and am delighted to have stumbled upon this product.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be reordering soon as I&#x27;ve been giving away some of my original six to family and friends so they can love Ultraclean too.</li>
      <li>The health product has micro-grooves technology that the company promises will give the user easy sliding and a superior clean, grabbing up to twice as much plaque as Proctor &amp; Gamble’s Glide Mint Floss.  </li>
      <li>I have to be honest, when I first pulled off a piece</li>
      <li>This floss is so nice - and is very strong..usually a couple of my teeth snag floss, but have not had any issues with this.</li>
      <li>While it is quite smooth, there is texture on the string to make it work well.</li>
      <li>I have successfully used this product for several years, originally under J&amp;J&#x27;s Reach brand, now under J&amp;J&#x27;s Listerine brand.</li>
      <li>Ultra Clean  30yds at $14.70&lt;</li>
      <li>This Johnson &amp; Johnson product is apparently a rebranding of the very popular, very effective Reach dental floss, missed by many, including me: at any rate its packaging says “new brand,” not new product.  </li>
      <li>Listerene Ultraclean Floss is amazing - almost like having your teeth professionally cleaned every day!</li>
      <li>Cool Mint  55yds</li>
      <li>Seriously, I started to use the Ultraclean floss on the recommendation of my dental hygienist because it does a better job of removing &#x27;sticky plaque&#x27; than the more famous &#x27;unpowered aircraft&#x27; floss</li>
      <li>and she was right.  </li>
      <li>if you&#x27;re buying in in a local drug store, be sure to get the correct one</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is way too easy to miss the fact the Ultra Clean is the same price as Gentle Gum Care</li>
      <li>Healthy White  30yds at $14.70&lt;</li>
      <li>Seems as good (the same) as Reach Total Care.</li>
      <li>Ultraclean has a nice mint flavor and is a little stretchy.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Who wants to spend additional time flossing?</li>
      <li>Listerine brand looked promising</li>
      <li>and I feel like it really grabs the stuff on my teeth.</li>
      <li>/&gt;First to say what it is not: it is not a thin string that will hurt your gums, is not overly waxy, &amp; is not so slippery that you can&#x27;t hold onto it without wrapping it 15 times around your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
      <li>Gentle Gum Care  </li>
      <li>It makes flossing so much easier and efficient.  </li>
      <li>it is: Flat ribbon-shaped, STRETCHY material with a light, hint of mint taste that is also gentle on your gums.</li>
      <li>It wouldn&#x27;t pull through the hole in the top because the roll was on upside down.</li>
      <li>And, although it is called Listerine, also apparently a much better known brand than the previous Reach, the package states that it contains no mouth rinse ingredients.  </li>
      <li>I wanted to love this floss, but it is rubbery and snaps when I am pulling it out of each tooth, making a mess on the mirror each time.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Its brands include numerous household names of medications and first aid supplies: the Band-Aid Brand line of bandages, Tylenol medications, Johnson&#x27;s baby products, Neutrogena skin and beauty products, Clean &amp; Clear facial wash and Acuvue contact</li>
      <li>The promo materials for this new J&amp;J</li>
      <li>This is my new floss of choice.</li>
      <li>I floss on a daily basis &amp; have always had the worst time finding a good floss that works well &amp; feels comfortable on my sensitive gums.</li>
      <li>and I have dental work that absolutely shreds other flosses</li>

<li> had to open the plastic housing and flip around the roll of floss in every single pack I got.</li>
<li> Similar to, but not exactly the same as, Reach TotalCare, UltraClean Floss.</li>
<li> I have no direct experience with the product.</li>

<li> As an added bonus, I seem to be using approximately only 2/3 the amount of floss that I used to with the other brand.</li>
<li> Plus I have never used this and actually seen anything come out on the floss, like I would on all my other flosses.  </li>
<li> Other types of floss can shred or break when used around a permanent retainer.</li>
<li> Not a huge deal, but the housing is not easy to open</li>
<li> We were disappointed the learn that J&amp;J had discontinued their Easy Slide floss which we have used for years.</li>
<li> this is a higher-quality than the typical dental &amp;#34;tape / ribbon&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;glide&amp;#34; floss..</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t break or shred in my teeth which are tight.</li>
<li> (It is a tiny bit tough to get between teeth that are too tight together, so if you have a crowding issue avoid, stick to the stringy stuff).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> less!</li>
<li> The mint flavor just seems ordinary to me.</li>

    <li> Seems as good (the same) as Reach Total Care.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Similar to, but not exactly the same as, Reach TotalCare, UltraClean Floss.</li>
    <li> We were disappointed the learn that J&amp;J had discontinued their Easy Slide floss which we have used for years. The promo materials for this new J&amp;J Listerine brand looked promising so we tried a sample from the drug store. It is fantastic! It&#x27;s even better than the Easy Slide; It stretches, goes through the tightest areas and never catches or shreds. If there were another star, I&#x27;d rate it higher!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price was good.</li>
    <li> best dental floss ever</li>
    <li> I like the floss, sure.  What I don&#x27;t like is the way the price is the same for all 4 choices but the AMOUNT you get varies:&lt;br /&gt;  Cool Mint  55yds at $14.70&lt;br /&gt;  Gentle Gum Care  50yds at $14.70&lt;br /&gt;  Healthy White  30yds at $14.70&lt;br /&gt;  Ultra Clean  30yds at $14.70&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is way too easy to miss the fact the Ultra Clean is the same price as Gentle Gum Care but you get 20yds ( 40% ) less!</li>
    <li> The best floss I iou use</li>
    <li> This floss is so nice - and is very strong..usually a couple of my teeth snag floss, but have not had any issues with this.</li>
    <li> My dental hygienist recommended this and gave me a sample. It is great! No waxy buildup on my teeth and no shredding floss. It is now MY choice. Thanks Amazon for the great price!</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this floss, but it is rubbery and snaps when I am pulling it out of each tooth, making a mess on the mirror each time. Plus I have never used this and actually seen anything come out on the floss, like I would on all my other flosses.  (Food clumps, etc)  Once I am done with this I will not be buying again.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this floss because she said it cleans better with its &amp;#34;jagged&amp;#34; edge over the waxes flosses.  I think it works great, and I am switching to this floss from the Glide I have used forever.  This floss doesn&#x27;t seem to break very easily, and it goes between the teeth well.  I have lots of dental issues, so I need a good floss.</li>

As an added bonus, I seem to be using approximately only 2/3 the amount of floss that I used to with the other brand.</li>
    <li> Hands-down the best dental floss I have ever found. My teeth are close together and I have dental work that absolutely shreds other flosses - I can&#x27;t even use &amp;#34;standard&amp;#34; floss and this is a higher-quality than the typical dental &amp;#34;tape / ribbon&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;glide&amp;#34; floss.. This floss has texture to it and I feel like it really grabs the stuff on my teeth. I ALWAYS recommend this floss to all my family and friends.</li>

While it is quite smooth, there is texture on the string to make it work well.

    <li> Listerine Ultraclean Floss, Mint.  This Johnson &amp; Johnson product is apparently a rebranding of the very popular, very effective Reach dental floss, missed by many, including me: at any rate its packaging says “new brand,” not new product.  And, although it is called Listerine, also apparently a much better known brand than the previous Reach, the package states that it contains no mouth rinse ingredients.  It does contain 30 yards (27.4.) of flossing tape. The health product has micro-grooves technology that the company promises will give the user easy sliding and a superior clean, grabbing up to twice as much plaque as Proctor &amp; Gamble’s Glide Mint Floss.  Dental professionals, of course, recommend flossing regularly because it is proven to remove periodontal-producing plaque between teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Johnson &amp; Johnson is an American multinational medical device, pharmaceutical and consumer packaged goods manufacturer founded in 1886. The corporation includes some 250 subsidiary companies with operations in over 57 countries and products sold in over 175 countries. Johnson &amp; Johnson had worldwide sales of $65 billion for the calendar year of 2011.  Its brands include numerous household names of medications and first aid supplies: the Band-Aid Brand line of bandages, Tylenol medications, Johnson&#x27;s baby products, Neutrogena skin and beauty products, Clean &amp; Clear facial wash and Acuvue contact lenses.&lt;br /&gt;I really missed Reach and am delighted to have stumbled upon this product.  It does, indeed, do a very good job of cleaning: I have tried it after summertime pig-outs of corn on the cob, and lots of, lots of blueberries.  The mint flavor just seems ordinary to me. Recommended.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great.  Very strong and stretchable.</li>
    <li> I was a Glide user until my dental hygienist turned me on to this. This is my new floss of choice.</li>
    <li> The best floss on the market. It doesn&#x27;t shred or break and has a bit of stretch to it.</li>
    <li> I love this floss.  It slides very smoothly -- better than any others I have used.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!! It makes flossing so much easier and efficient.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product for those with a permanent orthodontic retainer. Other types of floss can shred or break when used around a permanent retainer. This product eliminates that inconvenience. I have successfully used this product for several years, originally under J&amp;J&#x27;s Reach brand, now under J&amp;J&#x27;s Listerine brand.</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s friend wanted these so we bought them for her and she reimbursed us. Seems she&#x27;s picky about what she lets her kids use and was looking for the best price for these. She&#x27;s happy with the purchase from what I hear. I have no direct experience with the product.</li>
    <li> The floss itself is great. It used to be marketed as Reach Total Care and I&#x27;ve been looking for it for a while because I didn&#x27;t know about the brand change. The reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to open the plastic housing and flip around the roll of floss in every single pack I got. It wouldn&#x27;t pull through the hole in the top because the roll was on upside down. Not a huge deal, but the housing is not easy to open and I don&#x27;t like that I had to touch all of the floss before I used it.</li>
    <li> Great price savings and convenient to purchase in bulk</li>
    <li> I floss on a daily basis &amp; have always had the worst time finding a good floss that works well &amp; feels comfortable on my sensitive gums. This floss is so amazing I had to write a review, although I did not get it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First to say what it is not: it is not a thin string that will hurt your gums, is not overly waxy, &amp; is not so slippery that you can&#x27;t hold onto it without wrapping it 15 times around your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;What it is: Flat ribbon-shaped, STRETCHY material with a light, hint of mint taste that is also gentle on your gums. I have to be honest, when I first pulled off a piece and it was so stretchy I had my doubts. But it helps keep it in place on your fingers, and it grabs particles (you know those pesky popcorn kernels) between your teeth &amp; gums like magic! I was able to floss so quickly &amp; efficiently, it was great. (It is a tiny bit tough to get between teeth that are too tight together, so if you have a crowding issue avoid, stick to the stringy stuff).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who wants to spend additional time flossing? I sure don&#x27;t. Buy this stuff &amp; you won&#x27;t. I will never buy anything else!</li>
    <li> They floss just as well as the product it replaced.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t break or shred in my teeth which are tight.</li>
</ol>
