<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this stuff!  Keeps my make up looking fresh all day long!  Thanks</li>
    <li> I use this to minimize pores and it also helps makeup stay on longer.  I use a small amount on my nose before applying makeup.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!! It feels so nice on the face and make it look so good. Can&#x27;t go a day with out using it. LOVE</li>
    <li> i have oily skin that gets flaky patches along my cheeks.  This stuff is really great and smoothing everything out prior to application of make up and doesn&#x27;t make your skin shinier or greasier.  it&#x27;s almost like magic and makes your face feel amazingly smooth and soft.  I use mineral powder foundation and blush, and this helps everything go on evenly, and in my opinion, last longer.  highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I should have looked to see that this product is not oil free. My face is somewhat oily and this doesn&#x27;t seem to help in any sense. My face is splotchy with half of my make up off by mid day</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. One of my favorite primers. Smooth and velvety finish.</li>
    <li> I think I received the old version because apparently too faced released a newer version of this product? the clear kind? i received the flesh colored kind. But its ok it works fine, i didnt notice any break outs on my face over the period of time i used it, it gets the job done and works well with powder foundations.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by the salesperson at Sephora and I am highly dissapointed. By the end of the day my makeup felt greasy and it did not cover my pores at all. I ended up buying Clinique Pore Perfector which works much better and is applied over makeup. I wish I hadn&#x27;t thrown away the box so I could return it.</li>
    <li> Ok as an eye primer makes eyeshadow go on creamy. Just plain sucks as an overall face primer. Doesn&#x27;t do anything for wrinkles, dry patches, but does make your skin slightly matte. Definitely have to use more than a pea sized amount to get any considerable coverage. To tell you the truth powder chafing gel works a million times better as a face primer.</li>
    <li> I have super oily skin with large pores in my nose that are so visible!!!! I always have to carry oil pads with me to soak up oil by 9:00 in the morning. Because of this product, I no longer have to worry about that problem. My pores are concealed (without clogging them) and it has helped my make-up last longer. I was introduced to this wonderful product at a high end make-up store and I instantly feel in love with it. It has become a staple to my make-up routine. I wear it everyday under my make-up or alone, just to conceal pores. This is very soft and has minimal oil in it. It has lasted me about 3 months thus far. It doesn&#x27;t take a whole lot to use on your face. I have sensitive skin as well and I have not noticed any break outs or clogged pores with this. I would reccommend it for anyone who has annoying skin like I do!!</li>
    <li> I read a number of reviews about face primer &amp; decided to go with this one. It feels like nothing Ive ever put on my face, not in a bad way necessarily, just different. I can&#x27;t tell that it \\&quot;makes my skin flawless &amp; diminishes pores\\&quot; or that it \\&quot;makes it easier to apply my face makeup/makes it smoother\\&quot; or something. That just seems like marketing hype I bought into. The reason I bought primer was to help with my super oily skin. It doesn&#x27;t help. I&#x27;d almost say that it makes it oilier than when I just use my moisturizer. So it did not live up to my expectations. Bummer that was a $30 error. Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> This makes pores appear smaller, and that waffly, delicate skin under the eyes look much smoother.  It is very light in color -- if you are very fair and have trouble finding concealer that matches around the eyes, I recommend this.  After moisturizer, I apply it thinly with my fingertip, used like a spatula.  This is my first year dealing with post-menopause skin texture.  Most concealer and foundation simply calls attention to the delicate, slightly criss-cross-textured undereye.  A small amount of Primed and Poreless first came as a Sephora sample, and before realizing it&#x27;s meant for the whole face, I tried covering my lifelong dark circles.  It blends with my skin, doesn&#x27;t need foundation over it (though apparently one can layer it), and this tube will last for months.  It is silicone-like, and sits on the skin like Clinique All About Eyes, but thicker and with coverage.</li>
    <li> Love this look and feel this primer gives...will be always!</li>
    <li> This product worked well for my skin, it helped me to stay oil free all day and I have super sensitive acne prone skin and this did not break me out at all.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t make me pore less. It made me shinier. Want poreless primer go for NYX pore filler primer. This is a recommendation from an oily skin lady.</li>
    <li> Great primer. It has a slight tint to it so that it can be worn alone or under makeup. Applies smoothly and doesn&#x27;t create a &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; look on the skin.</li>
    <li> I put it on and was disappointed.  Then I waited a few minutes and was absolutely stunned.  I don&#x27;t have young skin and this product still works.  It made my skin look bright.  I&#x27;m a believer.</li>
    <li> I gave 4 stars because it doesn&#x27;t stay matte. I still have to blot after a few hours, but it&#x27;s a lot better than if I hadn&#x27;t used this primer. I love how smoothly it goes on and that there is a slight tint to the product. I notice an immediate difference in my skin&#x27;s texture upon application. I would recommend this product the the daily, low maintenance, make up wearer.</li>
    <li> I like how this makes my face look but if I use it for more than a couple of days in a row, my face breaks out.  Happens every time.&lt;br /&gt;:-(</li>
    <li> Best face primer out there. It works and it doesn&#x27;t have any bad effects on my skin. Once it&#x27;s on I don&#x27;t feel like I put it on. Great to just simply even out skin tone by itself. I wear this with only powder to work or on casual occasions. I hope they never discontinue this product.</li>
    <li> I love this product and just ordered the one for sensitive skin!  To me the sensitive skin one does not make your skin feel as soft as the regular one in the pink tube!  I would highly recommend this product in the container reflected in the picture.</li>
    <li> This goes on smooth on my face all day. I wear it alone as i don&#x27;t like to wear foundation and my skin feels soft all day. It&#x27;s colorless, but somehow brings out your natural skin color, but rejuvenated.</li>
    <li> My make-up lasts all day, definitely worth the price!</li>
    <li> I absolutely hated this product.  It made my makeup look awful.</li>
    <li> I LOVE Too Faced&#x27;s PRIMED and PORELESS products.  Over the summer, when my face was tan, I used only the [[ASIN:B004QBC43A Too Faced Cosmetics Primed and Poreless Spf Bronze Tint, 1-Ounce]] with SPF 20 (with no foundation over it). The PRIMED and PORELESS primer products have a much lighter coverage, so if you have blemishes that require heavier/thicker coverage, you would need to use the primer and something heavier on top. I&#x27;ve been using the primer almost a year (2 tubes, to be exact) and have not had ANY problems with breakouts (which says a lot for me). Now that I&#x27;ve pretty much lost all of my tan, I use just a TINY, tiny amount of the [[ASIN:B004QBC43A Too Faced Cosmetics Primed and Poreless Spf Bronze Tint, 1-Ounce]] and mix it with some [[ASIN:B002DP75R6 Too Faced Cosmetics Primed and Poreless, 1 Ounce]]. I LOVE both of these PRIMED AND PORELESS products ... same thing, just one with color and one with no color ... which is why I mix them together (for some color).   These are my ABSOLUTE favorite make-up items. The bronze tint cream comes out of the tube VERY dark, but as you blend it, it is MUCH lighter in color and texture. (I have relatively fair/light skin and it still looks natural on me.) You don&#x27;t need alot ... a LITTLE goes a LONG way. However, if you do accidentally squeeze out/apply too much (which I have done on more than one occasion), it is a VERY FORGIVING tint. You just keep blending/rubbing with a sponge until it is to the lighter, desired color that you want. (A good SPONGE is key.) The no-color cream comes out beige, but dries clear.  Not only does my face/complexion appear smoother and look better after applying this, but I have noticed an overall improvement in the texture of my skin (after daily use for a year).  Overall, I am very happy with this product.    FYI ... it is cheaper to buy most TOO FACED products here on Amazon (with the subscribe and save) than it is to buy it directly from TOOFACED&#x27;s website (or most any other website for that matter).</li>
    <li> I purchased Too Faced Primed and Poreless Skin Smoothing Face Primer from Amazon about 2 months ago. I was hesitant about spending $30 for a primer, but I had read good things about it.   I like the way it feels on my face when I apply it, but I can honestly say that I see no difference in the way my pores look or that my face looks any different either with the primer alone or under makeup. At least for me-NOT worth the money and very disappointed. I had to give it at least one star but would have preferred to give it none</li>
    <li> This is a great primer. The slight tint added helps even out uneven skin tone. Glides onto the skin so makeup can glide right over it!</li>
    <li> I have tried Avon magix primer for a few years now, and I decided to try Too Faced to see if its better, bad mistake. Too expensive and it doesn&#x27;t work. Avon does work better and less expensive. I will go with Avon from now on.</li>
    <li> Best primer I&#x27;ve tried! I have relatively oily skin and wear this under liquid MAC makeup finished with pressed powder. I have to blot once around lunchtime but that&#x27;s it! The brown paper towels in public restrooms work spectacularly for that purpose.</li>
    <li> Appreciate the light tint.</li>
    <li> This is such a soft and smooth primer I use before I put on my makeup.  It is a great touch up to keep in your purse.  Love the product</li>
    <li> There is just a little bit of color to it.  But that&#x27;s ok, cuz it isn&#x27;t supposed to be a foundation.  It makes a smooth surface on your face and helps adhere make up so it stays longer.  Doesn&#x27;t make me break out, and has a silky feel.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I thought that based on the product&#x27;s description that this product would be better than th Cinique instant perfectly in light, but I was wrong.</li>
    <li> This product makes my skin look smooth and flawless. It doesn&#x27;t cake or leave spots and helps foundation lay evenly on skin.</li>
    <li> this stuff makes my face look flawless   its a lil on the expensive side but im addicted   the merchant offers it for a cheaper price and it ships super fast.</li>
    <li> Never use another one. Makes your face really smooth!</li>
    <li> I have a new favorite beauty brand, Too Faced Cosmetics. Recently, I picked up their Primed and Poreless Face Primer, a little fun gift for myself to try out something new. I have never used a primer before, but have read many good things about the magical powers they can do to one&#x27;s face. And let me tell you- I love this product! The directions advise to use a nickel size amount and spread evenly over your face, and it will help smooth skin and banish pores. Too Faced even boasts that this primer will leave skin hydrated  and firmer, and make your appearance seem brighter, younger, and fresher.  The primer goes on underneath all makeup, foundation, bronzer and concealer included, and helps makeup go on smoother and stay on longer. And I stand by all those qualities! The pores on my cheeks were basically gone, my skin looked smoother and even felt much, much smoother, and my makeup lasted longer throughout the day- even through my workout routine! What really amazed me about this product though it how it covered a scar on my nose. I had my nose pierced for some time in college, and when I removed the ring I got a wonderful bluish scar left in its place. I have not been able to find anything to help conceal the mark, not even Estee Lauders \\&quot;miracle puddy\\&quot; that costs $100. But the Primed and Poreless helped fade the color once applied! I couldn&#x27;t believe when I looked in the mirror and could barely notice my scar. I definitely recommend this product for anyone who wants to erase pores, smooth skin, and help hide any imperfections. It doesn&#x27;t completely conceal acne, so I use a foundation over top, but it really does help make the skin look fresher. At $30, it might seem a little expensive, but I don&#x27;t have a problem paying for a product that actually works!</li>
    <li> This is first experience using a primer and I found this one to be amazing!  It makes my skin feel smooth as silk, and that alone would be wonderful, but it actually keeps my make-up from smudging, which is why I bought it in the first place.  Fantastic product!  Very highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Love this primer. I&#x27;ve been using it for a year and it definitely helps keep my makeup on for the day.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for those who do not want to wear foundation. It&#x27;s tinted, and makes my face really soft. It also shrinks your pores.</li>
    <li> Smells nice, applies nicely and is a great primer but it does nothing to hide pores.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Makes skin silky soft. Doesn&#x27;t help my oily skin though.</li>
    <li> First, let me say that I LOVE this primer. Worth every penny. But...&lt;br /&gt;I order it through Amazon &amp; it arrived one time but upon opening the package (under a bright light) I notice the tube was barely half full.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed with having to pay almost $30 for half a bottle of primer.</li>
    <li> This was the too faced product that impressed me the most. it fills the fine lines and gives you a beautiful even surface to work on.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. I use it under makeup or on days I want to go &amp;#34;naked&amp;#34;. Smooths complexion. Doesn&#x27;t make you break out.</li>
    <li> Love it!  I gave this 5 stars because it is light and smooth on your face and you helps your makeup look flawless..</li>
    <li> This primer really makes your skin look good under makeup or without. I use mineral makeup so it&#x27;s hard to find something that doesn&#x27;t get messy after your mineral powder is applied. Recommend because a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Excellent for extra large pores like my face. Soften face and makes foundation glide on really smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely buy again! Great when using alone without moisturizer too!</li>
    <li> soft, and the color makes it such that you really don&#x27;t need makeup...you have a soft/wonderful texture to your skin...great primer!  The color really makes it wonderful.</li>
    <li> I have used this for a long time, and while I have occasionally tried another brand, have never found one better!</li>
    <li> I was excited about the product, but don&#x27;t believe it lived up to my expectations. It&#x27;s definitely a nice &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; product and feels nice on your skin, but didn&#x27;t notice the minimization of pore size and/or appearance.</li>
    <li> My stylist recommended I switch to this primer a few years ago by suggesting that once you reach &amp;#34;a certain age&amp;#34; (I was only 40!) that you should start using a primer that does a better job of evening one&#x27;s complexion out... Plus, I have large pores and this really does make them disappear!</li>
    <li> Not sure why this mentions &amp;#34;color&amp;#34; as it is a clear solution, but this stuff is awesome.  It creates a slightly powdery feeling with fills in wrinkles, pores and other imperfections PERFECTLY before applying a foundation.  In fact, you can even use it alone to create the appearance of a more matte and flawless complexion.  I can tell the difference in my skin immediately if I apply foundation or BB cream without this pore reducer, as my pores have become a lot more pronounced since I turned 40.  This stuff cures the big pore and wrinkle problem, which are often exacerbated when you apply foundation or other creams.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I really love this product. A little goes a long way so this should last awhile. I like the way it helps my foundation seem flawless. highlight recommend.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfection.  It&#x27;s almost like a light foundation and it makes a huge difference.  You don&#x27;t need to apply too much.  This is a must have.</li>
    <li> I love the light coverage this gives by itself, but it&#x27;s amazing when I mix a pea size drop in with my foundation. It&#x27;s absolutely beautiful! They definitely made a customer for life out of me!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, I&#x27;m not sure it really keeps the makeup on any longer than usual.</li>
    <li> At first, it seemed too light (in substance, not color), but I found it did lay down a nice base for my Estee Lauder liquid make-up . It did not fill in those little lines around my lips, though.</li>
    <li> I bought this to cover enlarged pores and to help keep my makeup stay put longer.  After a 7 hour day, I notice my makeup (I only use Lancome powder bronzer and occasionally eyeshadow) looks the same as if I didn&#x27;t wear this primer, also I only notice slight pore coverage but nothing that a pharmacy brand couldn&#x27;t do.  Overall, the only thing this product has going for it is its great feel and texture, but after that theres nothing more I can say.</li>
    <li> This stuff does the job and conceals your pores! The only thing is it is so pricey. And I have oily skin so when I Pat you can see the pores again as it soaks up the product. It is a great product if you need it.</li>
    <li> I thought that primer was always kind of a joke for acne prone skin until I used this brand! it is more expensive than some of its competitors, but it will last me a long time. This primer makes my skin feel smooth and soft! This more natural product has not caused any problems!</li>
    <li> I was very excited to buy this, especially seeing all the 5 star reviews on here. However, I am very disappointed with this product. I bought it hoping it would conceal my pores better than the Rimmel London brand I had been using. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s not. In fact, my make up looks worse over this. Even with a thin layer on, my make up looks cakey. I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on this again, nor would I recommend it to anyone else.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Silky smooth and not heavy.  I wear moisturizer with SPF in it so I can get away with wearing this on top - I used to wear Covergirl with SPF in it but not as much anymore now that I have found this product.  This product is so much lighter than other foundations.</li>
    <li> After doing quite a bit of online research, I decided to try this to reduce the appearance of my large pores. It did not. For the price I paid, I was disappointed. I would not buy it again. I wouldn&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Great product, wears well and keeps my makeup on all day! It is a bit greasy, which I don&#x27;t love, but over all it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I had purchased this primer at ULTA, but the most recent time I went in there, one of the ladies stopped me and asked me what I was doing... I was like, \\&quot;uh, just buying this primer!!!!\\&quot; She said, yes it feels great, and works amazingly, BUT it is extremely unhealthy for your skin. One of the main ingredients is canola oil (under a different name) and she said it is extremely comedogenic and clogs pores and make you break out... I left it behind.I knew what she said was true because the second I put it on my face, it felt silky smooth.... it was an unrealistic silky smooth. Now I use a seaweed Mattifying facial moisturizer from The Body Shop, and it works excellently as a primer because it \\&quot;mattes\\&quot; your face without being greasy. And everyone knows that seaweed is freaking awesome and healthy for the skin. And SO much cheaper. I hope I helped a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***EDIT***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She also said it was the &#x27;high end&#x27; of the very &#x27;low end&#x27;.</li>
    <li> This primer gives my skin a smooth texture and primes it well. It does not break me out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely oily and sensitive skin and am not delusional enough to think that a simple primer will cure that. I drink a glass of water with lemon and take B-Stress vitamin supplement daily.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin. Large pores. I found this product to highlight those flaws. I only used 2 times because I found my skin to look better using only powder so nothing could sink in. Maybe the oil free version is better. I am 39 and Caucasian.  My skin shows everything.  Had high hopes, if you have large pores,  I don&#x27;t think this wwill help.</li>
    <li> It feels like pure silk on your skin and makes your makeup look flawless.  I use it every day over my moisturizer before I apply my foundation. Love it.</li>
    <li> I tried this after using hourglass and love the coverage and texture. Works as well at much better price.</li>
    <li> makes skin smooth to apply your makeup</li>
    <li> Ok, one has to know makeup and face products to be able to appreciate how wonderful this primer is, I&#x27;m so happy I found it.  Just a tiny bit goes a long way and it just makes the pores and imperfections disappear.  Foundation goes on smoothly and the skin on my face  is like that one a 20 somenting!  When a product like this comes along I just want every woman out there to know about it.</li>
    <li> Wear under make-up or w/o just for some coverage w/o make-up.</li>
    <li> After trying numerous primers, both drugstore brands and high end brands, I am happy to say my search is OVER!! This primer is incredible! I had been putting it on with my fingers but I recently had my make-up done by a professional who actually applied another primer with a brush-I now I apply this primer with a MAC 191 brush prior to liquid foundation, and the look is flawless!!! The texture is smooth and creamy, not at all oily, and for those that don&#x27;t wear foundation, it may even be enough for them. I absolutely recommend this primer!!!!!</li>
    <li> As I get older, my pores become more prominent, no matter what I do! A friend recommended I find a good primer and this is IT. I use it under Bare minerals and I never look greasy. It washes off easily and I swear my skin has improved since using it! It&#x27;s pricey, yes, but worth it!</li>
    <li> I have never felt a need for a primer but bought this on a whim. I am addicted now. It feels great and really does smooth the skin. I use it with or without makeup and it looks awesome. Totally worth the money.</li>
    <li> I just want to say that this primer is absolutely amazing! Too Faced makeup is the best to use if you have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Truly a decent product , but my problem is my oily skin cannot be contained by this or any other BB cream that I can find. If any of you out there have a similar issue and have found the Holy Grail of BB Creams for oily skin, please share your experience. This does look great for about an hour on me...for those with more normal skin..probably the one.</li>
    <li> Incredible primer, my favourite so far. Very velvety without being heavy or oily. Fills in my pores for smooth foundation application.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best &amp;#34;primer&amp;#34; I have ever tried!  Really love how smooth it makes your face feel!  Lasts a LONG time too, it doesn&#x27;t take much, it just goes on SO smooth!!!</li>
    <li> I really do love this primer.  Goes on really smooth and your skin feels velvety after it is applied. I don&#x27;t see wearing it alone, but it is great under foundation.</li>
    <li> This is my second tube of this product and still love it. It a combination of primer and the Benefit Porefessional so you get the best of both worlds. It truly does make my make up stay on longer. Highly Recommend!</li>
    <li> Pricey but still the best</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used primers before, but having tried this, I honestly don&#x27;t know why they aren&#x27;t touted more as miracle workers!  I have oily skin that gets dry in the winter and I&#x27;m still prone to breakouts (at 24) and I have a few scars from my teenage pimple-popping years. So foundation and powder is always a must for me, but I always end up looking greasy and cakey halfway through the day.  Ok, yes it is expensive - but it&#x27;s WORTH it. What you&#x27;re getting at Wal-Mart and Target may be cheap, but cheap products generally always mean cheap quality (though if you&#x27;re going to go cheap, Cover Girl and Maybelline are the best options).  Anyway, when I tried this stuff - it was really amazing, the difference I saw in my complexion. I looked like a completely different person - basically the me I would be if I wasn&#x27;t stupid as a teenager or if I didn&#x27;t have naturally oily skin. The product is beige, but blends in clear to your skin and applies with this smooth, powdery feeling. It&#x27;s extremely light and doesn&#x27;t weigh on your face at all. Though I still wear foundation and powder I&#x27;m using SO much less than I used to - and I don&#x27;t have to touch up my face AT ALL throughout the day, this primer keeps my skin soft, moisturized but not greasy, and actually gives me that highly coveted yet so hard to achieve \\&quot;naturally beautiful/no makeup\\&quot; makeup look. Too Faced has a customer for life in me.</li>
    <li> I wanted something that would fill pores and fine under eye wrinkles. This is super smooth, goes on really easy. Does fill pores (use slightly more than you think) and makes them pretty much disappear even before makeup. But, I cant say that it does much for wrinkles. I&#x27;ll happily use this for nose pores but as for being a &amp;#34;primer&amp;#34; I&#x27;m in HOT HUMID DEEP SOUTH Mobile, Al and I can&#x27;t say that it can keep up with makeup smudge after a half a day in the humidity. So, I&#x27;m still searching for a primer that&#x27;ll do all three jobs, filling pores, wrinkles and keeping makeup in place.</li>
    <li> For people with oily skin it doesn&#x27;t stand up to its promise. It promised to give me an airbrush look for most of the day. The oil started to come through within an half hour.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It really does help make your skin look smooth and does a good job minimizing pores. I have large pores on my nose and around my nose and it helps them a lot.  Added bonus- it&#x27;s super silky &amp; makes your skin feel amazing! Will definitely keep buying this!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product it is so amazing, made my foundation last so much longer, helps blend it in, and isnt oily or sticky. My only complaint is that it is super expensive for such a small bottle that lasts you about 3 weeks, especially if your like me and use it everyday....and since it is on amazon usually it is cheaper than in the store and it is the SAME PRICE as IN STORE...which is kinda disappointing too. The saying &amp;#34; You get what you pay for&amp;#34; is true but i still think that the price is a little bit much, it takes 30$ to fill my car up with gas, lol.</li>
    <li> After falling absolutely head-over-heels in love with Too Faced Eyeshadow Insurance, I decided to try the primed and poreless. My skin gets greasy throughout the day, and since the eyeshadow insurance worked so well, I figured the face primer would also do the job of keeping my makeup in place. I was wrong, but I&#x27;m not sure why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The primed and poreless does make my makeup go on smoother, look silkier and make my pores look smaller. It did not, however, make my makeup last any longer than it usually does. Overall, I like the product, it didn&#x27;t do what I expected, but I still love the results. I like that it makes my makeup look more flawless than it really is, I just wish it had actually given my makeup staying power.</li>
    <li> This feels nice and works okay. I just don&#x27;t think it is worth 30 bucks when I can find something that works the same way cheaper.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t be buying this product again. Just not impressed with it. Based on the other positive reviews, I thought that I was buying magic in a bottle.. Not so much. I&#x27;ll use it til it&#x27;s gone but I won&#x27;t be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> I really like it. It takes away the shining from my forehead and covers the eye bag a bit.</li>
    <li> Ordered it after reading and reviewing the product carefully, wanted the Bronze primer that has a tint to it&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s what it said, that it is a BRONZE primer but I got it, in just 5 days, that&#x27;s the good part&lt;br /&gt;But totally not what I expected, it&#x27;s very pail to clear! So how exactly is it a bronzer??&lt;br /&gt;Contacted the seller, and got an answer that I need to pay back the express shipping in order to get a refund&lt;br /&gt;That will appear within 30 days! Really???</li>
    <li> I typically don&#x27;t wear much makeup, but every now and then, a product comes along that I have to try. This is one of those products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about it is how light it is! It really glides over the skin, doesn&#x27;t feel weighty at all, and smooths out minor imperfections along the way. It&#x27;s good enough to wear without additional foundation (which is great on a hot day) and just a great little addition to your makeup set.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Too Faced eyeshadow so I thought to try this face primer with a leap of faith.  Unfortunately, after my first three days of use, my face broke out in a way I haven&#x27;t seen since early teenage years (Yikes!).  Since I&#x27;ve stopped applying this under my foundation my skin condition has restored.</li>
    <li> My most favorite primer, second bottle bought</li>
    <li> Applies smoothly, feels wonderful. Makeup doesn&#x27;t crumble or fade. It is slightly tinted, but not so much that you really have to worry about what color it is. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s thick enough to matter.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift from my husband (he cleaned out my wish list!) and I was expecting this to be phenomenal for the price but it is great. Smooth application, great staying power and does not break out my skin. I have used a few drug store brands which were good but this is definitely better.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It makes my skin feel soft and I feel like my make up lasts longer with it.</li>
    <li> I loved the way this makes my skin feel, however I was hoping it would blend my uneven tones better. Held up my mineral powder longer than without a primer. All in all, a pretty good product if your not looking to cover anything up.</li>
    <li> Primed and poreless smooths out my skin so my makeup goes on so smooth and looks flawless.  Sometimes I just use it after washing and moisturizing my face.  This is the best makeup assistant find in many years and I recommend it for anyone who has regular to dry skin.</li>
    <li> I prefer the much cheaper Rimmel primer. This didn&#x27;t work too well and I didn&#x27;t care for the smell. Overpriced.</li>
    <li> work as primer but won&#x27;t make your skin poreless. It gives skin rich matte finish which is very soft and silky to touch + odorless-  two things which i loved about it. Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> I read the revies and I was pleasantly surpised. Pricey for size but I appreciated trying the product out. Box damaged but tube OK.</li>
    <li> First let me say I am no expert on primer, I had never used primer before but the girl that helped me pick my new foundation at Ulta highly recommended using one so I gave it a shot. I&#x27;ve now tried a few different ones, this one being the most recent and my last effort with primer. Too Faced primer has a really smooth finish and glides on very easily.  I feel like when I apply it to my bare skin I can tell a difference in appearance but that could be in my head, I also love how silky my skin feels after application.  I do not notice any difference at all once I apply my makeup not only does my makeup not last longer but I actually get cakey around my nose after a few hours when I apply this which never happens when I do not use a primer. My experience is that I also break out after a few days using this primer. I have had similar experiences with all of the primers I have used or they just made me feel like I was too layered so it&#x27;s most likely just my skin and not the product, my skin just does not like primer.  Occasionally when I&#x27;m not wearing any makeup for the day but I&#x27;m going out I will still lightly apply this primer on my cheeks under my eyes and I like how my skin looks, I just can&#x27;t do this too many days in a row or I will break out. Overall, I like this primer the most out of the ones I have tried.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 40-something and have started having ugly big pores and oily skin. I&#x27;ve never worn a lot of makeup, especially not foundations. I still don&#x27;t and don&#x27;t plan to. At most, I&#x27;ve used face powder, but found that it now accentuates my problems instead of concealing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I discovered mattefying primers and love them (when they work). I&#x27;ve tried Too Faced Primed and Poreless, Urban Decay de-slick, and Stila HD Beauty Balm to name the top three. Others include drugstore brands as well as another brand which I won&#x27;t name because they started animal testing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite testing method is to wear my current favorite product on one side of my face and its challenger on the other side. Then I go outside and do yard work all day. At the end of the day, I look to see which side did best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stila Beauty Balm is a strange one. It&#x27;s basically a simple tinted moisturizer. It provides an evened tone to my skin, which is nice, but it contains tiny sparkley cosmetic-y stuff that I detest. It does nothing to minimize the look of large pores and it also does nothing to control oil shine. Still, I keep it around and use a dab under my eyes occasionally as a brightener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too Faced Primed and Poreless FEELS luxurious! I mean it really glides on and feels like the best moisturizer ever. I&#x27;m sad to say that&#x27;s where my compliments end. It did very little to control oil buildup (shine) and did absolutely nothing at all to conceal my pores. It may work under other cosmetic products, which IS it&#x27;s purpose I guess, but when used alone it falls flat...not in a good way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Urband Decay de-slick in a tube, while not as luxurious feeling as Too Faced, did the best job of all. After yard work in 90 degree heat, my pores still appeared drastically smaller and I had NO oil buildup (no shine other than sweat). Plus, a tiny amount goes a long way. This is my daily fave.</li>
    <li> This primer claims that it can erase pores and imperfections that it can be worn alone. I agree it is a high quality primer that sets the make up longer and soothes the skin  as for the fine lines i dont have them so i cant tell. As for the poes this my area XD you cant wear it alone lol it doesnt do any hiding for the pores or my spots on my face O.O it slightly SLIGHTLY minmizes th pores and i found out this after a long staring at my face wih a magnyfing mirror XD but so far it is the best primer i have used</li>
    <li> I have never found a primer like this one. It is not to gel or oily and when you put it on it doesn&#x27;t feel like it is long and it last all day for me. I work with dog and get puppy kisses all day and it still stays on</li>
    <li> I have some acne scars from years ago.  The pitted in ones and this stuff smooths them out better than anything I&#x27;ve ever found.  I&#x27;ve been looking for like 20 years. I will not EVER run out of this!  It&#x27;s pretty colorless so it blends really well and doesn&#x27;t look to thick or anything.  It&#x27;s pretty much invisible.  I love it!  It&#x27;s the same price at beauty brands.</li>
    <li> Great product. I love too faced cosmetics, but it was pretty pricey for the amount you get. Lasted me like 2 months tops, using it a couple days a week</li>
    <li> I love Too Faced cosmetics, and so when I needed a new primer, I thought I&#x27;d try this out.  In the past, I&#x27;ve used primers from Smashbox (the oil-free version), Illamasqua, and Tarte, and this one compares equally well with all of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t realize it when I ordered this, but it does provide a matte finish to it.  I prefer a more \\&quot;glowy\\&quot; look for my over-40 skin, so I just end up using a bit of liquid highlighter (I&#x27;m currently using the Boots No. 7 one, which I love) after I apply my foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This makes your foundation and blush glide right on, and it really does hide the pores and oilness of my oily skin.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I received the package, while it was timely and what I wanted. I used this product before and it&#x27;s amazing. However, this one was used and old, it crumbles when you put it on your face and it was only half way full - that is why it gets only 2 stars. The product looked used before and the box that it came in was falling apart. When you think about it spending $30.00 on something you expect a decent product worth money, not in this case.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great-- it makes your makeup last forever or, if you don&#x27;t use it with make up, it minimizes pores and makes your skin look great.</li>
    <li> I really like this primer.  I have large pores on my cheeks and this product reduces their size.  It is very silky and and goes on smoothly.</li>
    <li> Wow this stuff is great!! It is a great primer and really helps get your face ready for foundation. I have really oily skin and this has helped with that problem!! I really love this product!</li>
    <li> This dried out my skin and made it really flaky! I am so not happy that I spent so much money on a product that I do not like!!!</li>
    <li> I like that this is slightly colored so you can see where you are putting it on. It does help hide large pores. I would use it more but it is very expensive for such a little amount of product.</li>
    <li> I think this is a great product my daughter showed me it when she came to visit I&#x27;ve been hooked every since!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like it at all, it do nothing !&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the Clinique one.</li>
    <li> I liked this until I tried their new primer the hangover Rx. This is a little thick and didn&#x27;t minimize my pores at all. It does even out your skin tone nicely but I think their other primer moisturizes better and actually holds makeup much much better. Wouldn&#x27;t buy this again knowing the other products that are available but it was okay for the time being.</li>
    <li> Works as promised.  I cannot see my pores at all.  Feels nice, too.  Great for aging skin.</li>
    <li> This made me break out like CRAZY. I don&#x27;t have very sensitive skin and am generally okay trying new products. However, this primer felt really heavy and just having it on for a couple of hours made my face freak out. I went with Smashbox instead, since it just feels lighter. If you want super heavy coverage, this is probably for you, but for a casual make up user like myself, this is a bit much.</li>
    <li> Made my skin look really oily.</li>
    <li> Smooths look and feel of skin.</li>
    <li> Everyone needs this primer! It is absolutely amazing! My skin feels like silk after putting it on. You can wear it alone or sans makeup.. For a glowing look. Makes foundations and BBs go on a lot smoother so less product is used. I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Not certain how much t helps though it does make application of makeup easier</li>
    <li> quality primer, does everything it says it will - it only takes a dab &amp; so lasts for many months.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. I&#x27;m on my third tube. Goes on so smoothly, feels like silk on your skin, and my powdered foundation applies more easily. My makeup application retains its freshness all day. I have combination skin, and still break out occasionally on my chin, but feel like Too Faced Primed and Poreless provides a barrier, to keep my skin cleaner throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I ordered this to use as a primer and I have never used primer before. It gives a very nice, airbrushed look. It does not reduce the appearance of pores, however, or cover blemishes. Make sure to let it dry prior to applying foundation on top of it.</li>
    <li> Excellent coverage...tried this product before and really recommend trying it if u just want lite coverage....moisture for excellent finish...try it!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a while and love how smooth it makes my face feel - smooth as silk!</li>
    <li> Smooth, non smudging and lightweight primer. I have very light skin and you can barely tell i have this on. But it really helps the foundation go on easier.</li>
    <li> This beauty product is one of my favorites from Too Faced. A little bit goes a long way, feels smooth, and foundation goes on evenly with it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! i have suffered for years with oily, greasy looking skin on my face and enlarged pores. This is the only thing that has ever worked for me! A little bit goes a long way, I just apply a small amount all over my face before I apply my makeup. My face appears smoother and I don&#x27;t have to worry about it looking like a glazed donut by 9 am!</li>
    <li> This  primer works great for when I know I&#x27;ll be running around all day sweating. Even when I don&#x27;t, I end up using it. Big for price. I got a discount tho when I bought it. Usually the price is kinda steep. NO smell, no greasy feeling, no discoloration. Makes skin feel super smooth</li>
    <li> I can only notice a subtle difference. I even forget to put it on, so it hasn&#x27;t made dramatic difference that I can&#x27;t go without it</li>
    <li> love this product. works great on my oily skin. keeps my foundation in place all day. highly recommend if you have oily skin</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best. use it instead of foundation and my face feels cleaner, fresh, and sooo soft!</li>
    <li> Great product. A bit pricey for the amount you get. My makeup artist recommended I apply it to help smooth my aged skin.</li>
    <li> Makes face feel smooth and ready for makeup. Can wear under makeup or alone.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best primer ever!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It smooths out all the inconsistencies in my skin.  I often use it without foundation, but it also provides a great base for foundation.</li>
    <li> Only ok. Too expensive for what it can do. Does not handle my acne scars (my scars are very shallow and still it can&#x27;t smooth this eare). Does not handle oily T-zone. I found that L&#x27;Oreal® Paris Magic Perfecting Base Face Primer (&amp;#60;$10 for 0.5 ounce) is also non-comedogenic and works the same for me for less money.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! It makes my skin look absolutely flawless with very little effort and lasts all day. It is expensive but it is definitely worth the price based off how well it works and since you don&#x27;t have to use very much at all it lasts for a while. This is definitely a must-have in my makeup bag from now on.</li>
    <li> I purchased Top Faced Primed and Poreless in hopes of making my skin appear less red, reduce the look of large pores, and to use instead of makeup on occasion.  I fell in love with it after several days use as it is a great primer and makes my skin feel great and look healthier.</li>
    <li> Seems to do everything stated... Great primer, goes on smoothly w/out feeling thick or greasy.  Doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;ball up&amp;#34; when applying foundation.  I happen to use Glo Minerals cream foundation.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a difficult thing, to find the right primer. I have tried them all, Tarte, Smashbox.. you name it and this is the only one that does it for me.&lt;br /&gt;I tried the oil-free version of this and had to return it, it was like vaseline on my face.&lt;br /&gt;This creates a velvety, even complexion I love it! I also like the bronze for the summer.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this highly, I really love Too Faced! their eye shadow sets are gorgeous, I can&#x27;t say enough about this product. The 1 o/z  also will last you a very long time, 4 to 6 months.</li>
    <li> Have been looking for a slightly tinted primer ever since Revlon stopped making Vital Radiance. This product is very good on my over age 65 skin. Very smooth &amp; light. Wears well with or without make up.</li>
    <li> I was using Urban Decay make-up which was slightly pricier than this brand, but I think I like Too Faced even better now. The products go on great. They come in really cute vintage looking packaging and the convince of getting them through Amazon is great!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t feel like I get he longevity from this primer that I do with others of similar price but it s great to throw on I&#x27;d if going out for a few hrs or to wear alone for a quick trip to the store</li>
