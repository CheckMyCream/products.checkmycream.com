<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Stamping is tricky because you have to get the polish on your nail before it dries....but if you can pull it off, this is a nifty trick to do it.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the scraper that came with the stamper scratches the plates, but it doesn&#x27;t affect the final outcome.  Other than that, I like these and I look forward to using them for a long time to come.</li>
    <li> really happy with the purchase. shipping was quick! no flaws on any designs. would recommend store to anybody who is looking for this type of nail art.</li>
    <li> I love all the designs on the stamping plates but the scraper well it does not Work it scratches my plates so I use a card instead. Otherwise it&#x27;s great I just hope the scratches don&#x27;t Affect my nail art.</li>
    <li> I ordered 3 different sets of plates, the MASH ones are my favorite. I&#x27;ve tried several different designs and not any problems on my nails or my 4 year old daughters nails, she loves them too. I have tiny hands and nails and don&#x27;t even have a problem with the full nail ones, yay me. I can&#x27;t say enough how I LOVE my MASH nail stamp plates, I also got the 2 sided stamper, it works so much better than my other stamper too.</li>
    <li> These nail plates work really well. The images stamp clearly on the nail. My only complaint is that some of them are too small for my thumb nail. I know that I will be using these plates all the time and I can&#x27;t wait for new designs to be released.</li>
    <li> For my first stamping set, this is perfect. I usually do freehand nail art but for times where I don&#x27;t have the time or patience to do my nails stamping is perfect. I love that there are a wide variety of designs I can choose from. Most of all, the best thing about this item was that it was a 25 set kit. I also like how the image plates are a metallic black. Shipping was fast!</li>
    <li> I first want to say that I really like these plates. They seem to be etched really well, none of them that I&#x27;ve tried so far have come out like blobs, the designs are crisp, and I DID NOT use the special polish. Thick dark polishes will work, and I heard a tip that adding xanthan gum could turn any polish and make them like the konad special ones. These have a paper backing so they weren&#x27;t sharp, and the designs are cute.   With that being said, the \\&quot;full nail\\&quot; designs are small, and I have small hands and fingers (ring size 6). They are OK for me for most of my nails other than my thumb and ring fingers. But considering I would like to have a full hand with the same pattern most times, this is a negative. Because of this, and because I&#x27;ve found I really love this nail stamping stuff, I will be looking at other brands (BM, Red Angel) plates to see if I can find some wider full design plates. The non full design ones, however, are really great, and I&#x27;m glad I bought them. I&#x27;m a college student, so considering I wouldn&#x27;t be able to afford more than a couple Konad plates anyways, this is an awesome buy.    Note: I do not have any Konad or BM products to compare these to. I used the MASH stamp, and plate.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to stamping but I thought it was a great way for quick nail art.  The only thing I hate about these is that I can&#x27;t use half of them.  My nails are long so the full nail images do not cover, even if I cut them off I don&#x27;t think it would cover.  Other than that the images come out clear and I really like most of the images.</li>
    <li> I got these today and it&#x27;s only my second plate purchase. So far I have tried 3 different plates and all the designs have come out well. I&#x27;ve read issues with MASH plates that some of the images aren&#x27;t etched in well enough but haven&#x27;t come across that problem...yet. In the description it says 6-10 images per plate. Only 5 plates have 7 images and the other 20 all have 6 images. I felt there was a few too many &#x27;french tip&#x27; designs but that&#x27;s personal preference. The picture in the description is the actual plates you get which is nice. They also arrived very quickly. If MASH brings out a new set I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy them again.</li>
    <li> The plate set had a variety of different designs! I was able to find the houndstooth that I was looking for! It was soo awesome! There are other various designs which are used as tips or full nail designs. The detail was very well made and allowed for a clean finish when applied to the nail!</li>
    <li> This is a Christmas gift for my daughter.  I know nothing about nails but they shipped it quickly and everything looks as advertised.</li>
    <li> Just used these with the [[ASIN:B005V2LLXC MASH Double Sided Nail Art Plate Stamp and Scraper (Special Introductory Price)]].  We used Petites French White (by Scherer, Inc.) nail polish for the base and [[ASIN:B003O4DNX0 China Glaze Nail Lacquer (.5 oz) Shocking Pink #70293 (Neon Creme)]] for the stamp.  It worked GREAT!  I had heard that it was better to use the [[ASIN:B000PQDKU6 Konad Nail Art Stamping Polish - White]], which we have on order, but has not yet arrived.  After watching some YouTube videos we thought we would proceed with what we had on hand and had no trouble with the standard polishes.  We decided to use white as the base since we weren&#x27;t sure how other colors would show up on a colored base.  This video was really helpful [...].  We used an old credit card to scrape the polish as we heard that the metal scraper scrapes up the plates, and we used acetone polish remover to clean the plate and stamp.  I did a few dry runs on my nails before applying to my daughter&#x27;s nails, but had no problem whatsoever.  They look great, and it only took about 10 minutes to apply the stamps.  Well worth the price, and lot of really neat designs.  We used the zebra print (my daughter is *so* into zebra) and it looks cute!  - see pics I posted.</li>
    <li> My MASH plates set came a few days ago and I can gladly say that I do not have any complaints.  I ordered the plates and the stamper.  Everything arrived in great condition and I used the set for the first time yesterday.  Me and my daughter are looking forward to creating some fabolous nails!</li>
    <li> I LOVE MASH! They have Deep stamped designs &amp; copies well to the nail &amp; at this price there really is nothing better. With these plates you don&#x27;t even have to hurry. I swipe the design twice sometimes to get a cleaner stamp and it works every time. I have many different brands and lots of paperweights &amp; wasted money. I will only buy MASH now. Cant wait to get more!! Called Customer service. They are here in US. The guy who answered was really nice. He said website up soon and they will be getting a lot more plates in stock. (Different designs)With the money I save from not getting them done at the salon I can afford to get a few more sets. I hope they keep the prices low.(PLEASE) At least for the 1st few months so I can buy them all. You have a great product and I will be helping to market so you can have great sales and more products. Just make sure the Designs are cut deep and not over lapping and I don&#x27;t see you ever getting a complaint. Your product is TOP notch and could even be a bigger name the the original nail plate company. Once I used your product and the savings I got, I forgot that company&#x27;s name. LOL. Keep up the GREAT work.</li>
    <li> The set arrived on time with all the plates, which was good as it was a gift. The set was liked overall, nice patterns and easy to use. The only issue was that the full images are too small.</li>
    <li> The price and quality of these items is fantastic. As good as the \\&quot;other\\&quot; brand, but a lot less money. My grand kids are going to love these Christmas gifts!</li>
    <li> I got the plates and it didn&#x27;t work at all.  The nail polish just smeared off.  I tried it with all brands.  Wouldn&#x27;t buy this brand ever again.  Probably try the other brands instead.</li>
    <li> The mash nail products stink and they don&#x27;t work. I wasted all of my money on this junk.  I suggest you dont buy this.  It&#x27;s a rip off.  the stamper and scraper dont even work.  My tip to you is to not buy any products by mash.</li>
    <li> Great value, nice heave plates will be back for more. Designs do work GREAT with Konad. I couldn&#x27;t wait to get this in the mail, shipping was quick. Thankfully, I read and listened to other reviews of the product to help make the decision on these against competitors brand. So happy.</li>
    <li> My only complaint is that they seem to be in short supply.  I ordered some bundle monster plates because i couldn&#x27;t get mash and was sorely disappointed (they look the same but they are ooooooh, so not!).  These plates have smaller designs than konad, but i&#x27;m buying them for kids so it&#x27;s all good.  I bought the new stampers, have yet to try them (they are christmas presents) and the nail art brush set, which looks nice.  I&#x27;ve purchased the nail art crystals in the wheel as well and really like the size.  So far, so good with MASH.</li>
    <li> These templates offer a wide variety of images to please everyone!  I ended up using an old credit card to scrape the polish off the template instead of the scraper I bought with the stamp.  Everything went smoothly after that!</li>
    <li> These stamps work great! I have a Konad stamp too and I see no difference between them! Definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> There are many images to choose from, nice images but i think its too shallow to hold more nail polish. After i use my scraper to scrape off the access paint, it left me with a thin layer of paint, it&#x27;s so thin that i can&#x27;t see it. But When i use my stamper to take up the paint, i saw the paint on it, but its really a thin layer.</li>
    <li> Very cute set of nail stamps. I would recommend them to someone looking to do their own (adult) nails. Most of the designs are too large for a child&#x27;s hand. Overall I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> I originally used another competitor&#x27;s image plates so this isn&#x27;t the first set I&#x27;ve used. I loved the multiple images to choose from. The price is great for what you can get. Girls love my nails and were originally skeptical that a product like this actually works until they have seen my diy manicure. Needless to say, I am very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> OVER ALL GREAT EXPERIENCE. Quality excellent. Shipping excellent. All individually wrapped. This will be a wonderful gift my daughter will enjoy for years to come.[[ASIN:B00631ZXRA NEW 2012 MASH Set of 25 Nail Art Nailart Polish Stamp Stamping Manicure Image Plates Accessories Set Kit]]</li>
    <li> For the most part, I like the variety of designs each plate has. I&#x27;m still new to the whole nail stamping thing but so far so good. Each time I try a design I get better at it. My one problem with the plates are some of the designs don&#x27;t completely cover over the nail and it doesn&#x27;t look right. And sometimes after I stamp an image on my nail, it looks faded.</li>
    <li> Great designs!!! theres enough of every kind, french tip, full. and small designs....they a have a backing like konad....perfect just like it too...etched deeply....</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with the product, they came fast and they are just as good as konad:) thanks so much!</li>
    <li> These were my first stamping plates that I bought.  They stamp just fine. For those who say they don&#x27;t work, look up how to do stamping. You need to go fast or the polish will dry before you can stamp it.  I have small hands, and the full size images are too small for my nails. It&#x27;s not too noticeable on my fingers, but I have huge gaps on my thumbs.  Overall, a decent product that&#x27;s good for those who are starting out with stamping. If you want full images to cover your whole nail, look to Konad.</li>
    <li> i really liked the nail plates they were really cool and they worked great! They also were really easy to clean and worked well with all of the different polishes !!! i would def order more but i already have 25 diff plates!!!!! lol</li>
    <li> The Merchandise arrive in 2 days, which was far faster than what I expected!! Those plates aren&#x27;t just good, they are absolutely AMAZING and have the most gorgeous designs!!! I love my nails now, and I&#x27;ve been receiving all kinds of compliments :) Everyone is asking how I do them!!!Without these plates, my nails would look like trash!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And also, price is WAY more affordable than the price of Konad&#x27;s nail products. EVERYONE can buy them!! I am so happy with them, and I still have thousands more designs to use!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product on a Monday and it arrived in the mail early Wednesday morning.  Great service.  Each plate had different designs and there were no dups at all. By the end of Wednesday, I had a brand new manicure.  If you enjoy doing your own nails, this is a must have product.</li>
    <li> Items arrived quickly and well packaged. I&#x27;ve only used one of the plates so far but the image transferred wonderfully. I look forward to using the rest and may be back for another set. Thanks again.</li>
    <li> The nail art image plates came in 2 weeks after I ordered it on Black Friday.  I was very satisfied.  Came in plenty of time for Christmas.</li>
    <li> Looks fun and lots of variety.  Bought for my 10 year old this xmas.  She will love it.  Love the music note design.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with the &#x27;Nail Art Image Plates&#x27; work as great as the &#x27;Konad&#x27; brand but much cheaper! Every thing was brand new and all there. Defiantly will be buying again in the future.</li>
    <li> My image plates just arrived and I was excited to use them.  However, the full-nail image is not wide enough for my fingernails.  I can only use the small designs.  I&#x27;m disappointed because I bought the set expecting to create designs using the full-nail images.  Maybe Mash needs to create image plates for larger hands.</li>
    <li> These plates came in the mail very fast. I was impressed with the quality of them and loved all of the designs. However some of them seemed really similar to other plates that I have bought from other companies.</li>
    <li> There is a 25 piece set from Bundle Monster for considerably more money with very similar designs. You won&#x27;t notice whole plates matching plates by BM. The designs are mixed up. BM plates have more kitschy images, where as the MASH plates have more artistic designs and patterns. My only real complaint is that the designs are a little small. The pattern designs won&#x27;t cover your full nail and only maybe half of a thumb.</li>
    <li> I received the product quickly, and I like it a lot, it just would have been nice if there were instructions/quick tips that came along with it, you definitely have to practice at this, but it&#x27;s fun! I also tried to go to the website on the packaging, and it didn&#x27;t exist...</li>
    <li> Just as describe, and very fast delivery. No instructions, so had to watch a YouTube video to learn how to use. There were no repeats in the plates.</li>
    <li> The items were shipped super quick, the quality was great and the items were as described. Would buy   this product again.I would also recommend this product to friends.</li>
    <li> They work great and easy to use my teenagers love them and would recommend them to anyone.  Will by more of them thats for sure got here fast before they was due</li>
    <li> These stmapi g plates have really great quality and I can&#x27;t wait to use them ... But what I found kind of odd is that the full nail stamp  wouldn&#x27;t be able to fit and the entire nail because it is to small..but overall the are really good.</li>
    <li> These plates are awesome! I love the variety of stamps. Alot of the bundle plates have really tacky stamps but I like almost all of them in this bundle! Most of the stamps adhere to your nails very clearly although there are a few I have had trouble with, but I&#x27;m still new to the process.</li>
    <li> When i saw the designs i thought they were going to be big. But when i got them today, the images are TOO small for any of my fingers! I don&#x27;t really have anything much to say, but the shipping and packaging was great. The images come in very good quality by the way, i wouldn&#x27;t be too excited if a new set comes out, as-long as the images get bigger, And if it would, then ill totally go ahead and buy them. Oh, and they also have the paper backing thingy, i liked that :) But overall, It just fine :)</li>
    <li> Is in a perfect condition and a in time thanks In My experience was really fast and eficient   I really like beca use come In good time</li>
    <li> I bought this item in replace of my Shany Nailart Stamp collection (which might I add was poorly made) When I got these MASH nail plates I instantly saw a difference in quality which was a great thing. In the package I could tell that they were made to do the job and nothing less!! I am so very pleased that I bought this item, just mad that I spent time/money/energy on the SHANY nail kit which I would suggest no one purchase.... &#x3D;]</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the quality of the mash nail plates. Many fun and unique designs. However, the scraper that the double sided stamp comes with is horrible.  On my first application it scraped a huge scratch through the plate and ruined 2 of the designs. It made with metal on the bottom. I much prefer stamping and scraper tools from shany Nail products.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to get these plates. I have the first set and they were great.  one thing that people liked about the old mash plates was that the full design was large enough to coverthe whole nail.  with this set I thought it would be the same but with the bundle monster patters improved.  Sadly this was not so.  The all over designs we small and I have average sized nail beds with short nails.  The set seems to be the a combination of the two BM sets with alot of the same patterns.  For the price it was a nice choice and the stamps worked well.</li>
    <li> OK image plates but don&#x27;t get your hopes up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The price. You can&#x27;t beat 12.99 for 25 image plates.&lt;br /&gt;2. The shipping. The shipping was pretty fast. I ordered it on Monday, and received the package on Wednesday.&lt;br /&gt;3. The images that are for tips work very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The full nail images are not large enough for a whole nail. The only nail that these work on are pinkie nails. I was extremely disappointed in this, as I was hoping they would be closer to the size of the Konad nail plates.&lt;br /&gt;2. The image quality is not the same as Konad. If you go to youtube and type in \\&quot;Konad vs. Mash\\&quot; you will see what I mean. There are plenty of videos comparing the 2. I did see these before I ordered these, but still hoped that the quality would be slightly better than it is. Some of the designs are just not even usable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I would not purchase again. These plates aren&#x27;t HORRIBLE, but the whole nail images will not cover a while nail, and the detail is not as good as Konad. BUT if you think about the fact that a Konad plate is around 7.00 it would be well over 100.00 to order 25 of those... so I guess you have to factor that in as well.</li>
    <li> Fast mailing and just as promised.  I am having so much fun designing all kinds of nail art.  The brushes are great for all kinds of uses.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love nail polish and designs.&lt;br /&gt;I am always looking to do different designs and try new polish colors.&lt;br /&gt;I heard about the nail plates before and finally decided to buy them.&lt;br /&gt;I also purchased [[ASIN:B005V2LLXC MASH Double Sided Nail Plate Art Stamp and Scraper (Special Introductory Price)]] to go with these (the stamper is a must for these and this one worked awesome)&lt;br /&gt;The stamps do not come with any directions but are pretty self explainatory.&lt;br /&gt;There is blue plastic over the stamps, that you remove prior to using.&lt;br /&gt;All you do is put a little nail polish on the design you would like and scrape to remove the excess polish then use the stamp to apply the design to the nail.&lt;br /&gt;The scraper that came with the stamp is really garbage, I would HIGHLY recommend using an old debit/credit/gift card  because it is more flexible and really gets the right amount of polish off of the plate, also hold whatever you use to scrape the plate at a 45 degree angle.&lt;br /&gt;I did notice that some of the plate were already scratched where the designs are and ruined the design.&lt;br /&gt;Also, some of the designs are not even and did not come out evenly. Out of all of the designs maybe 6 were damaged (not plates, but design) so not that bad, but still would have liked to use a couple of the damaged ones.&lt;br /&gt;Good thing about these plates is you do not have to use special  polish, you can use any color any brand. Obviously the darker the more you will see.&lt;br /&gt;But with so many designs and with so many colors of polish the possibilities are endless with what you can come up with!</li>
    <li> I think this product was a great price but very similar to the other plates I bought. The images dont cover my whole nail, and seems to work well with very short nails.</li>
    <li> The set is decent, I wouldn&#x27;t use ALL the images but they are nice.  DO NOT FORGET to take off the blue film....  I thought they didn&#x27;t work but I forgot that part!  But they work great.  The polish needs to be a thicker polish, like Sally Hansen Insta-dri or the Konad brand.  If the polish is thin, it doesn&#x27;t work as well, and that goes for ANY stamping plate, not just these ones.  I would like to see more holiday and every day cute designs on the next set Mash makes.</li>
    <li> I have 3 sets of nail plates and these are my favorite! They stamp great and have lots of great designs. The plates have round edges so there are no sharp edges like some of the other plates I have and they also have the paper backing. They are made of a thicker steel and are engraved perfectly. The shipping was super fast and they arrived in perfect condition! Well worth the money!!!</li>
    <li> Great item. Worked perfectly. Great construction. Not flimsy. No sharp edges. The designs were etched deeply. The designs could be a bit bigger. Great beginner set, to get used to stamping. Great price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been doing stamping nail art for about a year now, so I have a lot of experience. I started off with Bundle Monster plates that were given to  me as a gift and bought a couple of Konad plates along the way. I picked this set up because it was a great price for a lot of different designs, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with them. For any of you who have the Bundle Monster set, even though some of the plates look the same, they are NOT the same. The MASH set etching is much deeper, so edges come out sharp. Even small details still show up. I would even say these plates are better than some of the Konad plates I own, and I paid $6+ a piece for those! They have the paper backing just like the Konad, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about cutting yourself on a sharp edge. All together I would highly recommend this set for anyone, whether you&#x27;re a beginner or an expert stamper.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase; you get a lot for your money and now a days every bit counts. Granted that using this stamp set takes a little practice, it&#x27;s a great tool for the days I want to be creative with my manicure and don&#x27;t have the patience or time to make the design myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had to complain about anything, it would simply be that it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to make the images slightly deeper on the plate for a better (easier) impression. Otherwise, I have no major complaints and I would recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> OMG!!!!!! I&#x27;LL NEVER HAVE TO GET MY NAILS DONE AGAIN!!!! I LOVE THEM!!!!! THESE THINGS ARE AWESOME.. WISH I WOULD OF FOUND THEM SOONER..THANKS A MILLION..</li>
    <li> This set has a huge variety for the money, works as well as konad plates, don&#x27;t forget to take off the plastic though! ;) Love it, kids love it, recommending it as a starter kit!</li>
    <li> I received my products within days of ordering them. I was very satisfied with the MASH products and will definitely order again in the future!</li>
    <li> the set came in very fast, in condition as described. overall, very sutisfied with the quality of the purchase. each plate was packed separately. best value i found available. 100% recommend</li>
    <li> I ordered these nail art image plates for my wife. She has been using nail art stamping to do her nails for a couple of years now. The MASH nail art image plates work great. My wife loves the plates and I love the price. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I have tried out some images from these plates, and they all gave good transfers. I have both MASH sets and both Bundle Monster sets, and there are some duplicate images between the 4 sets, but with so many images that doesn&#x27;t really bother me. My one complaint is the size of the \\&quot;full nail\\&quot; images. They just aren&#x27;t big enough. I don&#x27;t think I have big nails; they definitely aren&#x27;t long! But I can&#x27;t get a full nail image to cover any nail except my pinky in one stamp, and it can be difficult to line up a repeat. Overall, I am pleased with the quality of the plates.</li>
    <li> I ordered the MASH stamp plates as a christmas present for my neice who is really into doing her own nails.  First off I received my order within 3 days.  Secondly  I love this set.  ( I also ordered her the scraper as well)  Looking through the set, I realized how great of a value it was too appprox. 150 designs that I know my neice will love!!!  THe only thing is I wished it would come as a set with everything (plates, scrapper, even case) I will be ordering from this company again that is for sure!!</li>
    <li> I have not used this particular item yet, but seems to be like other items of this type.  Service was very good and fast</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought some sort of plates before years ago and I can&#x27;t remember how they worked but these are amazing! As long as you have a good stamper and scraper, these work great.  The amount of plates that comes with this is perfect because you can pick between so many different designs!</li>
    <li> I ordered a series of plates for me and my daughters for Xmas, and I luv them.The designs are so nice and creative. We are ready for hours of fun. The package came to my door and all the plates were there. Thanks MASH</li>
    <li> Much easier to use than Konad plates, which claim to have a sharper image, but take too many tries to get the design transferred to the nail. Mash has a nice variety of designs. I have found that using white on dark polish or black on light polish works best, other colors seem to fade out when mixed. Metalic colors are also good.</li>
    <li> Awesome! The picture on the site is amazing, and true representation of what comes in the package. Totally worth the money spent on them and the designs are awesome.</li>
    <li> Love these! Everyone compliments my nails, so easy to do.. And so many designs! Wish they had little letters though. Any girl would love these for Xmas..</li>
    <li> i LOVE these and they work just as well as the KONAD!  I  couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase!  Thank you :)</li>
    <li> I bought these plates when I ordered my Konad stamper along with some Konad plates.  I had read reviews on other websites saying that knock off plates didn&#x27;t work as well as Konad plates so I was hesitant to order off brands.  I ordered this set because of all the design options they offered and obviously because of the great price.  I&#x27;m fairly new to nail stamping but I can easily say in the few weeks that I&#x27;ve had these plates I&#x27;ve been able to use them just as easily as my konad plates.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give them a full 5 stars is because some images aren&#x27;t big enough to cover my entire nail when I&#x27;m doing a full nail design.  I have short nails so I have problems on my thumb, ring and index finger where my nails are wider.  I think that if they could make the images just a bit bigger, which would cut down on the amount of images we would get per plate (oh well), that they would be plates just as good and an actual rival for Konads.  Definitely a great buy and I&#x27;m happy I have them.  Hope you ladies enjoy them as much as I have.  :)</li>
    <li> When I first got this I was so excited to use it thought it would be like the konad brand but it was not it was so horrible. It didn&#x27;t work at all and left a smear when scraping off the extra ink and it did not fully leave the color on the stamp. So all you got are some plates that are usles and a waste of money. I&#x27;m hoping I can get my money back. Stick to the konad brand they work there just a little bit more pricy. Also I did try different plates with mash apx:10 or more and there all the same and dont wk. Save your money.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love love love this set.  I recently heard about nail stamping through a friend so decided to try this one out.  I was really surprised by how easy it really is.  The designs come out crisp and sharp and it very easy to transfer onto the nail stamper(purchased separately).  I would buy again and again!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter for Christmas.  She loved it.  She had another brand and liked these better! The designs were unique and creative.  There were many tips and full fingers designs.  It was a great deal for 25 plates!  [[ASIN:B00631ZXRA NEW 2012 MASH Set of 25 Nail Art Nailart Polish Stamp Stamping Manicure Image Plates Accessories Set Kit]]</li>
    <li> I ordered the plates in hopes that they would be comparable to the Konad plates. My daughter and I were pleasantly surprised that they worked very well. We love them!</li>
    <li> I had recently learned of the Konad nail art system, and when googling it, the MASH nail art system also came up. When I went to Amazon to look up what they had in stock, the new \\&quot;2012\\&quot; MASH nail art set image plates came up as a bundle which seemed to be a great buy! I love it, I was successful with my first try of using the kit. 2 things I recommend is that you buy the special nail polish in both black and white since those are very popular colors. All other accent colors you can use regular nail polish. When trying to use regular nail polish with bigger art designs, it takes a longer drying time than the special nail poish designed for these kits. It&#x27;s almost as is they instantly set, and they do not chip as easily as the regular nail polish designs did, they seem to adhere, and lock in design as you are creating them. I also recommend the dual sided stamper for people like myself who have some extremely small nail beds in which I use the smaller side to stamp art with. For my toes, I use the larger stamping  side. LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!</li>
    <li> good  items, was actually surprised when i received it. very solid and good printing capabilities. my girlfriend absolutely loves them. nice designs too</li>
    <li> Once you get the hang of the scraping part (so the scrapes dont get on the stamper) it works pretty good. my young teen can do it just fine</li>
    <li> My daughter really enjoys this set!  It took us a bit to figure it out because there weren&#x27;t any instructions that we could find, but my older daughter helped us out.  Now she&#x27;s having fun with it!</li>
    <li> I love doing designs to my nails and stumbled across these nail stamps, so I figured I&#x27;d might as well give them a try! Although I wish they had come with some helpful tips or something, it is pretty self explanatory. Take the blue film off, cover design with polish, scrape off excess polish, push stamper onto design, transfer design to nail. The MASH scraper definitely sucks and I made a giant mess trying to scrape and clean, but the stamper itself works very well. I tried an old card like everyone said for scraping and still had a little difficulty getting the excess out of the way, but I think it just takes time to get used to how it all works. For the first time stamping, I think mine turned out really good and I&#x27;m really excited to continue using it on me and my girls who are 12 and 9 and perfect to practice on ;) I did find out from experience that using a dark base color is not a good idea! Else it&#x27;s hard to see the design. All in all I would DEFINITELY recommend this to my friends. I also think this would be a lot of fun for girls at a slumber party!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m REALLY happy with the product considering it is so inexpensive! The plates have cute designs, but I just wish the full nail designs were a little wider.</li>
    <li> I bought the plates, and a stamper, not knowing how to really do it.  It does not take long to learn, its fast, easy, and fun.  My nails look beautiful!!</li>
    <li> Lots of different designs. Super cute &amp; easy to use A++++. Got items on time exactly as described. Would recommend to any professional or at-home nail enthusiast.</li>
    <li> bought for my 12 year old daughter....we both love to sit and do our nails.  everyone asks us if they can come over and try the stamps!</li>
    <li> I ordered this set to give to my daughter for Christmas.  I had already ordered a set from another company for my daughter-in-law, which I paid more than twice as much for. (I didn&#x27;t do my homework before buying, shame on me.)  Anyway, I had two different sets to compare.  This set is much nicer.  The designs are better with a nice variety.  The price makes it great!</li>
    <li> the plates are of very good quality and my daughter is enjoying creating nail art. This is a great value. I am very happy with the product and delivery.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try this product because I watched a bunch of youtube videos on the konad system and thought \\&quot;oh wow, this one is inexpensive, great for a first try\\&quot;.  The nail plates are a lot smaller than I thought they would be and therefore don&#x27;t fit the width of my nail and aligning the patterns up to create a finished nail--well i haven&#x27;t got the hang of it.  The quality of the transfer isn&#x27;t that great--the final product isn&#x27;t something i&#x27;d wear being an adult.  However I can see where this product would be incredibly great and a load of fun for a child or a teenager.  I have found that if you apply a little nail polish then scrap off the excess and then apply another coat and scrap, stamp and apply--the image is a higher quality.  Probably best to invest in konad nail polish for best results, or a thicker, gel-ish consistency of polish..anything that would take more than one coat to cover a nail regularly will work--but any polish that would take more than one coat the image/pattern being transferred is unlikely to show up.  Altogether, i&#x27;m rather disappointed with the product.</li>
    <li> Got to my house when they were supposed to. They were packaged great, I cant wait to try them out I love the designs.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with these nail plates. I didn&#x27;t know what to expect,since this is the first time I use nail plates. I would suggest you not use the metal scrapper that  I purchased separately. It tends to scratch the metal plates and it  is to firm. I used an old credit card, which was flimsy and bendable. Working with nail plates does require practice, but I have been very happy with my purchase. I would recommend these plates to all my friends.</li>
    <li> The product that was purchased has been a very good asset to my daughter and I. It&#x27;s simple to use, and a great way to have quality time. Also, I have received very nice compliments when I have gone out shopping.</li>
    <li> These stamp plates are awesome, great variety, amazing price, shipped right away and were quick to arrive, would order again!</li>
    <li> Im so glad I got this set when it was 7.99 now they increased the price but it&#x27;s still a steal!&lt;br /&gt;Most of them are Bundle Monster dupes from their 2nd set but you can also see some plates from the 1st set. I was debating whether to get the BM 17 pc or MASH&#x27;s 25 pc and im happy to pick the latter. The quality is superior and so far, all my stamped images have came out clean without using the Konad&#x27;s special polish. I would purchase this now before they increase the price again. Think \\&quot;Christmas Presents\\&quot;.. (;</li>
    <li> I love these plates! They shipped very fast. Nothing was missing  very  easy to peel of protective plastic. Edges aren&#x27;t sharp. All in all I&#x27;m very pleased</li>
    <li> I ordered this nail art set for my daughter. So far, we have experienced a great product and great service! I highly recommend both the product and the seller!  Cons: the brushes tend to fall out of the bag easily, but this issue is easily remedied.</li>
    <li> I have a large set of stamps from Bundle Monster, and while the images between the two packs overlap, I find it easier to work with the stamps from this set. I don&#x27;t know if the stamp is deeper or what, but I just feel like these are easier to use and the images come out clearer and cleaner, especially on those images with the tiny details and lines.  The images are a little smaller than the Bundle Monster plate images, but this isn&#x27;t really a problem for me. For full-nail images, I just stamp twice. The stamp still looks good, and I can use the more intricate designs more easily, so that makes the smaller images worth it.</li>
</ol>
