      <li>The Oral-B Precision Clean head is my preferred brush head.</li>
      <li>My oral hygienist told my dentist that everyone&#x27;s teeth should be as clean as mine.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Replacement Oral-B Brush Heads for my Oral-B Professional Precision 1000 Rechargeable Toothbrush are identical to the brush head that came with my new toothbrush. If brushes last for the 3 months as advertised then I now have enough brush replacements to last the next 18 months! With time I will be able to give a better review on durability and most importantly observations of my teeth from my dental hygienist and dentist. In the long run, length of durability of brushes, health of gums and teeth will make the higher cost well worth it!</li>
    <li> delivered on time and as described</li>
    <li> Good price fast shipping</li>
    <li> arrived on time and was a perfect fit for the handle.</li>
    <li> Always like the Oral-B electronic toothbrush</li>
    <li> Yup, toothbrushes. Grand.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and delivery</li>
    <li> Exceeded my expectations</li>
    <li> These replacements work seamlessly with my oral-B handle, and this multi-pack is the cheapest I have found.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted.  No problems whatsoever.  Local BJ&#x27;s has stopped carrying this version of replacement head.</li>
    <li> I just wish these weren&#x27;t so costly, because to me they really do feel and work better than the knock-off brands.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> This method of  tooth care has been my vehicle for about eighteen months now.  For me it is the only method.  If you can purchase the system and begin a regiment that will make your checkups top shelf.</li>
    <li> I love the oral-b simple brushes. I&#x27;m not into any of their more &amp;#34;featureful&amp;#34; ones. This gets the job done and I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> Completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> Great item, exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> These toothbrush heads are easy to replace and I like the colored ID ring.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Buying from Amazon provides good price and fast delivery.</li>
    <li> My periodontist recommended these and/or the sensitive version for my sensitive/receding gums post gum graft surgery. I feel that they are soft enough and have been beneficial in the healing/growing process for my gums, my gums look much healthier now than they ever have before since using these heads + the Oral-B 3000 electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, they are a much better value on Amazon than they typically are in the grocery store at only about $5.50 a head, depending on if Amazon is offering a coupon or not. I think each head lasts about 4 months or so, depending on how far you want to push them. The bristle indicators start to go after about 2 months, but I never noticed any splaying on mine through a full 4 month period and overall they remained in pretty good shape. Don&#x27;t brush too hard and properly dry the heads every time and they should last a good long time!</li>
    <li> These are the perfect replacement brush heads for the Pro 1000.</li>
    <li> These give me the best check-ups when my dental hygienist sees me every 6 months!  Excellent product!!</li>
    <li> Just okay...too soft for me</li>
    <li> No problem with this product. I have no idea why so many people are complaining.</li>
    <li> fit my Oral-B 4000 electric toothbrush.</li>
    <li> As shown in Amazon&#x27;s site.  Meets all expectations.</li>
    <li> Great product. Exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping and great product, as usual.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize my teeth were never really clean from a regular toothbrush. These work great with a reasonably-priced electric toothbrush and more expensive brushes just aren&#x27;t necessary. As it is, my oral hygienist says I&#x27;m one of her easiest patients when cleaning time comes. I went seven years between cleanings one time and it still wasn&#x27;t that bad.</li>
    <li> The brush fits the motor unit perfectly. That is more than I can say for the generic replacement brushes that I had tried&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> Glad to find a multi-pack at a good price.</li>
    <li> Item exactly as described and delivered quicker than expected.</li>
    <li> Cleans Professionally!</li>
    <li> high quality. sturdy product</li>
    <li> same brush as I have been using for several years and have been happy with. why mess with success.Review requires too many words</li>
    <li> The only style toothbrush heads we buy. It&#x27;s like getting a cleaning by a dental hygienist every day!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried using generic brush replacements, but nothing works like a genuine Oral-B.</li>
    <li> These Oral B brushes are much better and last much longer than cheaper ones that you can buy.</li>
    <li> These are a little different than the ones they replaced, but I like them a lot. They slide onto the base easily and the brush design seems to do a better job of getting into all of the places I am trying to clean. They&#x27;re pricey, but worth it, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> this replacement head is hard to find since oral b has obviously decided to discontinue.  sad, these are the best for me so i was very happy to find them here.</li>
    <li> Brushes are great but they are just a little to hard. After 2 or so weeks of use they are perfect.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t give it 5 because it&#x27;s my first electric toothbrush and I don&#x27;t know how to really rate it. It&#x27;s awesome though, much better than an analog brush. It makes my teeth feel soooooo clean! SOO CLEAN.</li>
    <li> These replacement heads do the job and I am very pleased with them.  I received them promptly.  Worth the money.</li>
    <li> Works well.  What can one say.</li>
    <li> Awesome price!! And I have extra just in case!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Oral-B  electric toothbrushes for over 17 years now.  Love them.  No cavities, practically 0 tartar.  My kids (ages 3 &amp; 5) also use these without issue.</li>
    <li> fast and well preserved.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t order the generic!  No good.</li>
    <li> Excellent  It&#x27;s what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> These are definitely superior to the store brand I tried. The store brand did not fit the shaft of the handle properly, had a bulkier head, and noticeably stiffer bristles.</li>
    <li> These are a little expensive but they are the original oral-b heads, so I am satisfied. I have used them in the past and they work great.</li>
    <li> great item for a great price</li>
    <li> Fit my Braun Oral B toothbrush nicely.  (model 1000 I think)</li>
    <li> They are original equipment replacement brush heads...exactly like the ones that came with the Oral-B electric toothbrush. They work the same, look the same, feel the same. What else needs to be said about them?</li>
    <li> They are working good. May be a little bit softer than what I would like and are definitely softer than the ones which come with the brush.</li>
    <li> I have been using Oral b products for 10 years or so and getting great check ups.  Love my oral b brushes.</li>
    <li> They get the job done.</li>
    <li> Love the brushes that clean between my teeth. I just have no use for the other two brushes designed for braces.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for a friend for Xmas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He was very happy with the Oral B toothbrush set I also purchased.</li>
    <li> These brushes are the real thing.  Normal prices at brick and mortar stores are much more expensive.  These are a good buy and much more convenient. Excellent seller.</li>
    <li> I am happy with the product.  I alternate it with the floss action brush head.  I&#x27;d recommend it :)</li>
    <li> Mom loves these thing and sometime they aren&#x27;t the easiest thing to find</li>
    <li> These are quality brush heads. I have used the generic ones, but they just are not as good and do not last as long as these Oral-B heads.</li>
    <li> Another product that we could not find locally.  These are exactly what we needed at a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t last even a month, the blue strand is already fading so it&#x27;ll have to be replaced very soon. I don&#x27;t think these are the original heads that comes with a new toothbrush.</li>
    <li> fast service ,great product</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good replacement.</li>
    <li> I love brushing my teeth with toothbrush oral-b</li>
    <li> received and looks good, I haven&#x27;t replace them also.</li>
    <li> Granted, they are more expensive than the generic.  But I can honestly say that each brush lasts 3 months with minor degradation.  I haven&#x27;t tested the generic, but if they only last 1 month, then they should be less than 1/3 of the cost.  5 brushes X 3 months, that&#x27;s over a year.</li>
    <li> This is what I needed and very cheap compared to buying them in a store!  Thanks</li>
    <li> My teeth are thoroughly clean. white and sparkling.</li>
    <li> of all the toothbrush heads that oral-b makes, this one is really good for sensitive teeth and guns.</li>
    <li> I have tried Oral-B&#x27;s other types of brush heads but I keep coming back to this original/basic head because I think it really works the best! These do a fantastic job and every time I brush I feel like I just came from the dentist after because they make my teeth so smooth feeling.</li>
    <li> These are of course replacement heads. They are the same type I started with when I purchased the toothbrush over a year ago. There are several other types that also fit my model brush. The precision clean does a nice overall cleaning with an emphasis on the gum line and all surfaces of the teeth. I&#x27;m pleased with the results I&#x27;ve gotten. My dentist seems to be happy with my choice as well. As with most things in life that wear out, I wish they would last a little longer. However they do their job well while they last. I will probably continue to use the precision clean heads.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes and it&#x27;s great that the bristles fade when it&#x27;s time to switch to a new one. They also come with different ring colors to easily identify which brush head is yours.</li>
    <li> These heads are great.  They fit perfectly and don&#x27;t come off.</li>
    <li> Been using these for several years.  These are best tooth care  i have ever used.</li>
    <li> loved the replacements</li>
    <li> The Oral-B Precision Clean head is my preferred brush head. It was the recommendation of my Dentist and I feel it cleans my teeth well. According to my dentist has been helping my gum health. Kind of a win-win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are heads for the Oral-B PRO series electric toothbrushes. I got these for my [[ASIN:B00O8ODHOA Oral-B Pro 5000 SmartSeries with Bluetooth Electric Rechargeable Toothbrush]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These fit:&lt;br /&gt;▸ Oral-B® ProfessionalCare® SmartSeries 5000 with SmartGuideTM&lt;br /&gt;▸ Oral-B® ProfessionalCare® SmartSeries 4000&lt;br /&gt;▸ Oral-B® ProfessionalCare® 3000&lt;br /&gt;▸ Oral-B® ProfessionalCare® 1000&lt;br /&gt;▸ Oral-B® VitalityTM Precision Clean&lt;br /&gt;▸ Oral-B® VitalityTM Dual Clean&lt;br /&gt;▸ Oral-B® AdvancePower® 400 Series&lt;br /&gt;▸ Oral-B® AdvancePower® 900 Series all current Oral-B handles&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people have reported problems with the heads they used. I have had no problems with the heads I got so far, though I&#x27;m only in the 2nd month of using the first of the 4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The identical model Oral-B brand brush heads have been available on Amazon at widely varying pricing. I strongly suggesting careful shopping and be sure you are getting the genuine product and not a &amp;#34;compatible&amp;#34; head from another manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because my dentist is happy and I&#x27;m happy I&#x27;m going to give these Oral-B Precision Clean heads 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps someone!</li>
    <li> Update: I have been using this round head brush for at least 2 yrs now (with the Oral-B 1000), both the generic and the name brand (both are the same), and my teeth have never been cleaner. I change heads every 3 months on the dot. I have it on my computer calendar as a reminder. My oral hygienist told my dentist that everyone&#x27;s teeth should be as clean as mine. I even went for more than a year without a visit and same thing. When leaving the dentists office the other day, the receptionist wanted to set my appointment for semi-annual as I have mostly done in the past and I asked if it would be unreasonable to do an annual instead. She checked with the hygienist who said that would be perfectly fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I also use the Dentek Easy Brush (buy these, you&#x27;ll be glad you did) and floss daily between brushes. Makes a big difference. This from a guy who did not take very good care of his teeth and gums in his youth. Now that I do, what a big difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not used any of these replacements yet but as they are like the original brush head that came with the unit I can say that I like these smaller round heads much better than the fuller brush head. They leave much more room to maneuver the brush, especially around the back areas where my wisdom teeth reside. :-)</li>
    <li> Great quality product.</li>
    <li> What has Oral B done to us! In renaming their replacement heads, they have cause consumer chaos. Remember \\&quot;the artist formerly known as Prince\\&quot;? The replacement heads are now bracketed by a lot of formerly known as... and these are not to be confused with the knock off&#x27;s that reviews say self-destruct after two days. Here is what has brought a challenge to domestic bliss... Party A is fiercely loyal to flexi-soft... now extinct. Party B was accused...rightly or wrongly... of using the last flexi-soft in the Western Hemisphere. Two packages of possible replacements were ordered and neither one consoled party A, though it was reportedly labeled as being extra soft.  Mourning continues... party B suggested boiling the last known flexi-soft replacement head and using it until search parties could be formed to go on quest for any reclusive flexi-softs that might still be out there... somewhere.... Party A has taken the matter under advisement but remains inconsolable.  The saga of the Oral B replacement head debacle continues... film at 11.</li>
    <li> good product , very fast shipping</li>
    <li> Great replacement brush heads.</li>
    <li> I bought these along with the toothbrush so I won&#x27;t have to go looking for them at the store soon.  Most stores only stock the ones that are sold most.</li>
    <li> should have ordered the soft ones.  it&#x27;s painful</li>
    <li> I ordered these and had no issues with them breaking or not working. They fit right onto the Oral-B toothbrush and were exactly what was ordered.</li>
    <li> Same as the expensive ones in department stores. Are exact same brand, Oral B. no issues at all.</li>
    <li> I believe that some of the reviewers are getting counterfeit brush heads instead of the real thing. I just bought some Precision Clean brushes and performed the test that Braun recommended. Scratch the grey Oral B logo with a dime. If it comes off, it is not the real thing. Mine passed the test. I haven&#x27;t used them yet, so can&#x27;t give an accurate rating.</li>
    <li> Have used these for years. Love them. Overpriced but the generics are not good so I have to buyvthe OralB brand refills.</li>
    <li> Ever since buying the Oral B professional toothbrush from Amazon, replacement brushes are required; therefore a new purchase of the oral-B Professional Clean brush heads was needed from amazon.  They arrived in two days and immediately put to work.  My dentist is happy.</li>
    <li> Execellent product and fast delivery!</li>
    <li> Does a good job of cleaning your teeth.</li>
    <li> Having an electric toothbrush has completely changed for the better my dental hygiene.</li>
    <li> My teeth and gums love these.</li>
    <li> Tried alternative manufacturers replacement heads, but they are just not worth it.</li>
    <li> Just like  the original..</li>
    <li> They fit on the toothbrush and clean your teeth. The price is outrageous, but when I read all the reviews of the non-brand replacements I just wasn&#x27;t sure I was willing to risk it.</li>
    <li> the are the exact replacements for the Oral B electric toothbrush and work great to keep you teeth clean.  buy some</li>
    <li> The brushes work perfectly in my teeth brushing routine and hold up very well.</li>
    <li> thorough cleaning and a good price</li>
    <li> Perfect for my travel, battery run Braun toothbrush</li>
    <li> Bought some generic brush heads.  What a waste of money.  You get what you pay for.  Bought the generics from WOOT.com!  They lasted from one day to two weeks.</li>
    <li> I have used electric toothbrushes for the past 10 years. All Oral B. This one is like the &#x27;Bentley&#x27; of toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> This particular toothbrush head work better for my oral health care</li>
    <li> Toothbrush heads as described. Works well, and was recommended by my dentist.&lt;br /&gt;Pricey, but in the end worth the clean you get.</li>
    <li> Use these with the Oral-B toothbrush.  Super fast delivery.  Appreciate that!</li>
    <li> I was very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Arrived promptly and I am very pleased with the brushes.</li>
    <li> These seem to be genuine Oral-B brushes.  Only time will tell, because I don&#x27;t know how to tell from the packaging.  They were pricey in my opinion, but still cheaper than retailers.  I&#x27;ve gotten them cheaper from Amazon in the past, but perhaps those were not the &amp;#34;real thing&amp;#34;.  Although for the price I got them for, I was extremely satisfied -- they worked just fine and lasted long enough.</li>
    <li> These work well, but not so well if you have braces.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. And in perfect shape.&lt;br /&gt;It fits perfect and very convenient that comes 5 count per box. At home we are 5 and four of us use this brush.&lt;br /&gt;We love it !&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> Fit my Oral B Sonic base handle perfectly.</li>
    <li> Love this replacement brushes.</li>
    <li> I like this toothbrushing system.  \\And this is a good price and fast delivery.</li>
    <li> These are a perfect fit and they clean well.  Will keep buying them from Amazon because local stores charge a much higher price.</li>
    <li> There is nothing like the original Oral-B replacements.  They feel great, last longer... I haven&#x27;t found another brand that makes them so well.  So, I buy them because I&#x27;m obsessed with a good teeth cleaning.  But, 3 stars because they&#x27;re very over priced.</li>
    <li> Good price for hard to find in store product.</li>
    <li> I find the 2 minute timer on this electric toothbrush does make brush longer than I did with my manual toothbrush.  My teeth also feel cleaner, so I am guessing the brush does remove more plaque than my manual method of brushing. Unit does last a full week after an overnight charge.  Very good basic electric toothbrush.</li>
    <li> They do what they&#x27;re supposed to do. No pinching. Just good brushing.</li>
    <li> The 5-pack brings the price down considerably.</li>
    <li> These heads are more expensive than the generics but worth it. The generics are thrashy and some slip off the handle in mid brush.</li>
    <li> Been using an oral B electric for years and I think this is the best option for this application. I like the size, I have used all the other options and they didn&#x27;t seem like they worked as well. I think they were more for marketing  than practicality. If you use an electric toothbrush, I would highly recommend this head.</li>
