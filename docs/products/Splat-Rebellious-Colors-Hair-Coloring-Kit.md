      <li>My son loved it.  </li>
      <li>and she loved it</li>
      <li>I am fairly displeased with this product.</li>
      <li>After reading all these good reviews I was like &#x27;why not?&#x27;</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t have been more happy.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t damage my hair, and didn&#x27;t have very many brassy tones.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and great color after.  </li>
      <li>and I kept a damp washcloth handy and just wiped it off.</li>
      <li>This stuff was really good :)</li>
      <li>Unless you are used to doing your own hair you should probably get someone to help you.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great, and I&#x27;m sure it would be even better if done with a couple bottles of the bleach instead of</li>
      <li>so I used my own.</li>
      <li>, I just don&#x27;t want to put my hair through that kind of stress or damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/dying my hair on my own</li>
      <li>My friends who helped me with applying it were astonished, they looked at me and asked if it was okay, I laughed and Told them It was better than okay!</li>
      <li>She tried this splat kit and wow, the results were great!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Now it Does sting (most bleaches Do) but it also Came with a Nice packet of a Neutralizing agent to stop the Bleaching process when you&#x27;re done.</li>
      <li>Love this color, have used it before, yet this time didn&#x27;t have to leave my home to get.</li>
      <li>(you shouldn&#x27;t be washing your hair more than 2-3 times a week</li>
      <li>It did the job, just make sure to use a toner after you use this because if you dont...you&#x27;ll be walking around with orange hair.</li>
      <li>(you shouldn&#x27;t be washing your hair more than 2-3 times a week</li>
      <li>but if I was you who is reading this I&#x27;d say you&#x27;d be better off purchasing the dye from the store.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never bleached my hair before, but have bleached friends and families hair many times.</li>
      <li>It will help your hair recover more quickly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love this bleach.</li>
      <li>I bought this at the store, but i&#x27;m just gonna write this here because i&#x27;m sure people will be looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this hair dye - it dyed my hair</li>
      <li>My hair was fully saturated with the bleach, I made sure not a spot was missed, as I am no rookie in bleaching/dying.</li>
      <li>It also tells you how many quantities of the product you will need for you hair type.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never ever had a bleaching product advise any more than 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Splat is good for permanent color in fun colors and for an affordable price.</li>
      <li>However it gave excellent silver white after 3 applications.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I didn&#x27;t want to put more bleach in my hair, for fear that it would make my hair fried beyond hope.</li>
      <li>I will purchase this again but off of Amazon instead :)</li>
      <li>(I was more focused on that area and put more on), and lightened the rest of my hair by five or six shades.</li>
      <li>Will be ordered more.</li>
      <li>(I checked to make sure there would be no ill-effects if I bleached my purple hair)</li>
      <li>I read other reviews and it seems perfect for what im trying to do.</li>
      <li>So now I have the most unique hair colour</li>
      <li>Very quick and easy.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if this means it wasn&#x27;t as strong or what, but the result was chunky coloring in my hair.  </li>
      <li>i have bleached my hair before and my scalp felt fine</li>
      <li>so you don&#x27;t get chemical burns if you keep it away from your scalp you should be fine.</li>
      <li>I  do think it works on people with fine hair, or lighter hair color</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this brand for peekaboo highlights and it was fine</li>
      <li>The first bleach kit was smooth and went on perfectly while the second one clumped up and kept clogging the spout</li>
      <li>That bleach worked great at lightening my light-brown hair to a brassy blonde (as it was supposed to).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My hair is naturally a light brown color.</li>
      <li>I understand this happens sometimes in the bleaching process, but when my hair was already fairly light</li>
      <li>As far as the delivery date the package came early which was awesome.</li>
      <li>The box also comes with deep conditioner and shampoo which was very nice~</li>
      <li>It was a good consistency and mixed easily in a bowl.</li>
      <li>I started by applying it to 2in of my hair, and then I was planning to apply it 1 in higher and one more 1in application, each in 10min lapses,</li>
      <li>I deep conditioned my hair directly afterwards and it turned out great!</li>
      <li>My hair is naturally black and when I used it on virgin hair the first go, it worked perfectly after two applications.</li>
      <li>And it turned bright yellow.</li>
      <li>really platinum white bright love</li>
      <li>I love dying my hair unnatural colors and now that I can&#x27;t do that anymore (thanks, job)</li>
      <li>Not as white as the pictures, but he loved it anyway.  </li>
      <li>quickly after i started applying the bleach to my roots, i started to feel this prickling tingling sensation on my scalp.</li>
      <li>It does the job, but not as quickly and intensly as splat.</li>
      <li>go to sallys or some other beauty store for your bleach and use special effects hair color here on amazon AMAZING colors and lasts forever!</li>
      <li>I have Very Fine hair (styled as a Mohawk no less)</li>
      <li>I bought this at out local Walmart, I&#x27;m pleased with the results (ended up being more of a sandy/teddy bear blond), and I imagine I will be more pleased after I dye it again with the bleach in a few days.</li>
      <li>good thing im dying it pink over, or id be in a sticky situation.  </li>
      <li>It completely bleached the top of my head</li>
      <li>It is still healthy, shiny, and soft.</li>
      <li>My natural color is a really lovely auburn, idk why I choose to dye, but I did.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It was well worth the money I paid for it.</li>
      <li>, she does not believe that it was worth the discomfort it caused her.</li>
      <li>Once washed, my hair does look more like a light orange/blonde color, but once I put the blonde hair dye over it looks just like I went and got it done at the salon, without spending over $100 every couple months.</li>
      <li>so Splat is the right stuff.</li>
      <li>if you feel it burning don&#x27;t  leave it on rinse it out right away</li>
      <li>Used my bleach yesterday and went to color today and can&#x27;t because it isn&#x27;t the right color.</li>
      <li>I would never recommend it - it won&#x27;t come out right</li>
      <li>I went from a black/red to now a blonde but with some dark spots(needed two boxes) and it looks great!</li>
      <li>I decided to give it one more shot, as I wanted to bleach out all the orange then dye it a more natural blonde.</li>
      <li>I went to Sallys and bought wella t-14 which took all of the yellow out and gave me a gorgeous ultra light ash blonde.</li>
      <li>Word of caution, this stuff works fast, so try to work quickly applying.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works great!  Results in a true platinum blonde.  I was very happy to find a brand of hair dye that does not test on animals. - Cassandra</li>
    <li> I love this hair dye - it dyed my hair exactly how I wanted it - BLEACH - I hate wimpy blondes (for me_) I like it as white or as platinum as you can get - if you have long or very dark hair I would never recommend it - it won&#x27;t come out right - you&#x27;d have to have your hair stripped of color or professionally done first. Keep that in mind - blonde is hard to obtain on dark hair but once achieved it&#x27;s the easiest to keep - I know I&#x27;ve been dying my dark hair blonde for 30 years - this stuff ROCKS. For blondes and light brown hair only, and even then I suggest two boxes. (not at the same time) I would do one box then see how you like it then wait a few days after conditioning it, then the 2nd box otherwise your hair will be too fried.</li>
    <li> I have a 3n which is a darkbbrown hair. It didn&#x27;t really lift much but I was at least expecting a red orange color</li>
    <li> I have used almost every other brand of bleach over the years but this one made my hair feel like barbed wire.it made it blonde but it also caused irratation.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with this product. I had dyed my hair black, and unlike another product I used, it almost completely made my hair blonde. I have to buy a second box, but it states on the box itself for thick, dark or long hair that two kits may be used. I have no problem buying this a second time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like with all bleaches though make sure to be careful to not over process you hair, since it will dry it out. The box also comes with deep conditioner and shampoo which was very nice~</li>
    <li> Had to bleach twice, and the second bleach burned like hell (my hair color is a dark brown). But still didn&#x27;t get a pale blonde color, more like a yellow-orange. Had to go out and buy dye to cover it up...</li>
    <li> It did a great job lightening my hair and I would totally use this again. I did not need to go go platinum or anything since I was going to cover up wit purple, but it did the job</li>
    <li> Turned my hair yellow. Bright ugly yellow. And I had blonde hair just looking for even lighter. And it turned bright yellow. I don&#x27;t recommend this product for anyone unless you have already light blonde hair and want to go white blonde.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen this brand a few times in various stores and it piqued my interest.  I love dying my hair unnatural colors and now that I can&#x27;t do that anymore (thanks, job) I&#x27;ve been rotating around natural ones.  My hair is a medium brown so I prefer to bleach it before applying any colors.  I finally decided to give this one a go due to price and ease of purchase.  It didn&#x27;t work.  I mixed the bleach and developer in the bottle, and a big chunk of bleach didn&#x27;t get mixed in.  I don&#x27;t know if this means it wasn&#x27;t as strong or what, but the result was chunky coloring in my hair.  Thankfully I was already planning on dying over it so I didn&#x27;t have to face the world with unintentional tri-color hair (which, when intentional, can be awesome, I know, I&#x27;ve done it).  I wrote to Splat to express my dissatisfaction and they promptly sent me a new container to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few months later I finally got tired of my roots and decided &amp;#34;Why not try it again?&amp;#34;  This time I mixed the solution up in a bowl to be sure it would all be thoroughly creamy.  That worked.  But it was a bit thin.  I didn&#x27;t think this was much of a problem, until it started dripping on me while I was sitting around waiting for it to bleach my hair...I had to wash it out ten minutes early because the bleach was so watery and it was going everywhere.  My hair was dyed red and I was bleaching over it and my roots.  Now, my hair is orange and golden-brown of varying hues instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grand summary?  It failed twice for different reasons.  No go for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this and when it came in the box was mooshed, and when I opened it the peroxide bottle was open and empty.&lt;br /&gt;I would like a new one delivered please</li>
    <li> It did the job, just make sure to use a toner after you use this because if you dont...you&#x27;ll be walking around with orange hair. You&#x27;re welcome!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been dying my hair since I was 13 years old (25 now) and last year I decided to go blonde. I purchased this and my hair looked awful after I was done. I went to get my hair done at a salon after that, but now that I only have to do my roots this works great. Once washed, my hair does look more like a light orange/blonde color, but once I put the blonde hair dye over it looks just like I went and got it done at the salon, without spending over $100 every couple months. I would recommend this if you have short hair or you are just doing touch ups.</li>
    <li> I love using splat its long lasting and it comes with both bleach an dye, I would definitely recommend this product. I&#x27;ve never bought it online but I always purchase Splat at CVS.</li>
    <li> My son loved it.  Easy to use and great color after.  He is naturally dirty blond, but this dye turned his hair a yellow/white.  Not as white as the pictures, but he loved it anyway.  He bought the raspberry next but we haven&#x27;t tried it yet.  Splat is good for permanent color in fun colors and for an affordable price.</li>
    <li> I started with my natural hair which is a dark brown/almost black color, and bleached it once. Within 30 minutes my hair was a medium blonde. A few days later I bleached it again, and it is now a platinum blonde/silver color! It didn&#x27;t damage my hair, and didn&#x27;t have very many brassy tones. It was a good consistency and mixed easily in a bowl.</li>
    <li> This is the most painful, itchy, and irritating bleach I have ever used. My skin is red and peeling and I&#x27;m crying from the pain.</li>
    <li> I am fairly displeased with this product. My girl used it to lighten her hair and complained about an intense burn immediately after it accidentally touched the scalp. It went away a moment later, so she assumed it was ok, just an initial reaction, and proceeded to leave it on for a few more minutes. Those few minutes ended up causing her intense pain and she had to prematurely wash it out. She had to dye her hair right after the bleach (for her work...had to change color) and even the dye that she has used in the past burned. All because of this crappy product. While it did lighten the hair in the few minutes she had it on, she does not believe that it was worth the discomfort it caused her. Be warned!! Burns SEVERELY!!!!</li>
    <li> Awesome product as always</li>
    <li> I started out with darkish medium brown hair that I hadn&#x27;t dyed in over a year, however, I used to dye it darker for several years (so that may or may not have effected my results). I have straight hair that is just a bit longer than shoulder length and my hair is neither thick nor thin. I have done two processes with this bleach so far and my hair is still orange. Each process I have had to use two kits to saturate my hair, one is absolutely not enough unless you have short hair. You may need 3 or 4 if your hair is even longer. It gets costly, but it&#x27;s still cheaper than a salon and WAY easier to use than quick blue. Each process I kept it on a bit over an hour. I anticipate at least one more process to get light enough to put toner on. So far my hair hasn&#x27;t broken off (fingers crossed). Oh, and this stuff tends to drip. So wear something you don&#x27;t care about getting bleach on and keep tissues handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, keep in mind that this is my personal experience. Everyone&#x27;s hair is differently and will take to chemicals differently. A friend of mine said her dark hair totally went blonde the first box she used, so that may or may not happen for you. If you decide to use this bleach, I highly recommend buying at least two at a time, but preferably four so you have enough on hand in case you need to do it twice. You can always use leftovers for your roots if all goes well. Also keep in mind that bleaching can be painful!</li>
    <li> My daughter went bleached blonde/ platinum last year.  Getting her color retouched at the salon every 6 weeks was too expensive.  She tried this splat kit and wow, the results were great!  Very quick and easy. Even the hairdresser was impressed with her results.</li>
    <li> Love this color, have used it before, yet this time didn&#x27;t have to leave my home to get. Will be ordered more.</li>
    <li> My eldest did this and she loved it she really does want to do this again so Splat is the right stuff.</li>
    <li> Orders aqua rush. In the sealed boxes marked aqua rush I got blue envy.  I bought them before I went on vacation so I could do them as soon as I got back and didn&#x27;t even think twice about checking to see if the color is actually the color. Used my bleach yesterday and went to color today and can&#x27;t because it isn&#x27;t the right color. Usually works well,  but double check what you have when you get it before using!</li>
    <li> My hair Is orignally blonde and after dying it dark for over 2 years I decided to go back blonde because I just hated redying all the time. After reading all these good reviews I was like &#x27;why not?&#x27; And I have never been so unhappy with a product before. It worked really quickly and even skipping over my roots and just touching up on them basically, my roots are now bleach blonde and my hair is now a gross orangy sand color. I would only recommend if you are doing a small portion of hair and not all over bleach. I&#x27;ve used this brand for peekaboo highlights and it was fine but this was a horrible decision..</li>
    <li> Love this bleach. This bleach actually makes my the white that I want. where others leave it yellow.</li>
    <li> I bought this bleaching a week ago, just got it and used it. My goal was to dip dye my hair purple. I read other reviews and it seems perfect for what im trying to do. The product specifies that if your hair ir long ot thick you might need to use two bottles. I started by applying it to 2in of my hair, and then I was planning to apply it 1 in higher and one more 1in application, each in 10min lapses, well my hair is tick but I had more than enough product (ah and be careful, if you do leave the bottle unattended, the product will start coming out like a volcano) Used it for 50min according to the instructions and my hair was some type of honey color. Washed it with water, dried it and reapplied, gave it 40 min and the color was slightly lighter. In the end I went to the store to got some blonde hair color and used it on the tips only.&lt;br /&gt;Im kind of dissapointed with this product, if I were to actually bleach my entire hair color I would need more than 2 packages, as the color never even went to the white color it needs to get the purple shade I want.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it was my hair, my hair is tick and black. I  do think it works on people with fine hair, or lighter hair color</li>
    <li> I have been trying to get to the pink pastel color and only needed one last bleach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was my first time using this brand and it actually made my hair darker. Not sure how that happened. I have been spacing out the bleaching over a cpl of months to ensure I don&#x27;t completely destroy my hair, and this product did it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This said, I used Pink Fetish with the idea that it will eventually fade out and I can work with that as a base to make pink pastel.  The ends washed out after 5 days, granted they have been colored for years, but the top is bright pink, and not a very nice pink. So I look a little ridiculous and have been using baking soda with Dawn soap on the roots to wash it out (only barely working).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, I was not happy. Bleach wrecked my hair more than other brands and the pink either washes out right away or stays stubbornly in, in patches.&lt;br /&gt;Will not buy Splat &#x27;anything&#x27; again</li>
    <li> splat is GARBAGE you can buy at wal mart dont waste your money go to sallys or some other beauty store for your bleach and use special effects hair color here on amazon AMAZING colors and lasts forever!</li>
    <li> I have used this brand of dye before so I can certify that it indeed works. As far as the delivery date the package came early which was awesome. I couldn&#x27;t have been more happy.</li>
    <li> This stuff was really good :)</li>
    <li> Bleaching powder worked perfectly! I didn&#x27;t have to worry about measuring which was a plus! There was plenty of bleaching power for my hair (only did tips) and it worked fast.</li>
    <li> If I could give it zero stars, I would. I originally picked up two boxes, as I have rather long and thick hair. About halfway through the process, I realized no way would these two bottles cover my whole head. So I decided to do only half of my head for the time being. My natural color is a really lovely auburn, idk why I choose to dye, but I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed the directions said for darker hair, leave the bleach in for an HOUR. I&#x27;ve never ever had a bleaching product advise any more than 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I let it sit for the full hour on half my head, and some. My hair was fully saturated with the bleach, I made sure not a spot was missed, as I am no rookie in bleaching/dying. This bleach also burnt my scalp like none other I have ever used. I powered through the pain for the name of beauty. After i could no longer take the pain, and the hour and fifteen had passed, I went to rinse my hair. As soon as it hit the water i was disappointed. I could tell that it was going to come out that awful copper colour. I washed the rest out, shampooed and deep conditioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it dried, half my head was that terrible in between copper color. Disappointed, I returned my to the drug store, humiliated, and reluctantly purchased another two boxes, to finish the monstrosity on my head. Same exact result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As much as I would love to go pick up a duo of my usual go-to bleach kit (manic panic), I just don&#x27;t want to put my hair through that kind of stress or damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just hope the actual dye I purchased won&#x27;t be affected by this terrible terrible bleach job. Keep me in your prayers.</li>
    <li> Hands down the worst bleach I&#x27;ve ever purchased. Gave this two separate tries to no avail. The first time I used it I just wanted to go blonde, I have naturally medium brown hair with golden and ginger tints; this lightened it to an unsightly copper orange with bits of bleachy yellow. I understand this happens sometimes in the bleaching process, but when my hair was already fairly light AND I left it on for a long time, it should have worked, but didn&#x27;t. I decided to give it one more shot, as I wanted to bleach out all the orange then dye it a more natural blonde. The second time was HORRENDOUS. I left it on a long time, and it turned my copper hair into a bright peroxide-orange, yellow mess. You would think bleaching my already lighter hair twice would make it bleach blonde. Not with this product. Despite it&#x27;s excessively runny consistency which makes it incredibly difficult to apply, it flat out doesn&#x27;t work. Just don&#x27;t buy this product and save your time, money, and hair.</li>
    <li> My 14 year old daughter won&#x27;t use anything else.  This works so well.</li>
    <li> This really fried my hair, I can&#x27;t comb through it anymore. And it made it like an orangey yellow. My hair is going to be stuck like this because now it&#x27;s too fragile to bleach again thanks to this product.</li>
    <li> notes - i have bleached my hair before and my scalp felt fine, i also have very short hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i bought this product from the store when i realized my hair was getting pretty bad - i had bleached it twice before and my roots were looking horrible. i decided to first do a round just with the bleach on my roots and then another round all over. quickly after i started applying the bleach to my roots, i started to feel this prickling tingling sensation on my scalp. i thought i could ignore it but it only got worse, to the point of where i would twitch and had to take a paper towel just to scratch at my head. this happened both times i used it, though it slowly got better as time went on, it was still bad until i washed it out, of course then it went away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;now besides the fact of how horrible it felt, i do have to admit i&#x27;m very happy with how my hair turned out. right after washing it out it looked a bit orangey but the next morning it was light blonde. i think i&#x27;m going to bleach my hair one more time before i dye it blue, but i definitely don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ll be using this again due to how painful it was.</li>
    <li> Crap my hair start falling and turned orange so redye it again horrible product</li>
    <li> So, I actually bought this from Walgreens and it cost more...I wish I&#x27;d bought it off of here. Any who, I am very satisfied with this bleach! I went from a black/red to now a blonde but with some dark spots(needed two boxes) and it looks great! I was afraid there&#x27;d be orange since I had bleached my hair years back from black and it looked yucky. So...no orange. Yay! I will purchase this again but off of Amazon instead :)</li>
    <li> I used this to lighten my hair &amp; it ripped my hair out after turning it orange. I have NEVER had this problem with any other bleach.</li>
    <li> This product lifts color very rapidly...but I will not use it anymore....the powder does not dissolve no matter how long I try shake it  to mix...the spout is always clogged.</li>
    <li> Well I just got my hair kit this morning and I must say. I&#x27;m VERY disappointed. When I opened the box I happen to see the box to the kit itself is already opened and soaked. The bleach in the kit busted open and got everything. Ruining it all. I don&#x27;t know if this happened in the shipping process or packaging but if I was you who is reading this I&#x27;d say you&#x27;d be better off purchasing the dye from the store.</li>
    <li> I bought this at the store, but i&#x27;m just gonna write this here because i&#x27;m sure people will be looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hair bleach is the WORST!! I looked around and i&#x27;m not the only one who&#x27;s had this happen. I dye my hair a lot and i&#x27;ve never had any problems. I wanted to dye my hair a bright color so i decided to bleach it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what happened. The mixture itself was really grainy. When applying it it felt a bit uncomfortable, but it was fine something i could handle. But it felt like at least a minute after i let it sit it started burning. The closest way i can even describe it is this: Imagine having a really bad sunburn on your scalp and on top of that have each individual strand of hair pulled just enough to hurt but not enough for them to be pulled out. I ended up sitting around for not even fifteen minutes before rinsing it out. Granted, i wasn&#x27;t planning on rinsing it out i thought &amp;#34;I got this fair i can handle it a bit more,&amp;#34;. What made me decide to jump and rinse it out (couldn&#x27;t have rinsed it out fast enough btw) was when i looked in the mirror to see how my hair was doing i noticed i was getting the beginning of chemical burns.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bleached my hair before, and i&#x27;ve never had an experience like this one before. It was just God awful, i wouldn&#x27;t wish this on my enemy at all.&lt;br /&gt;And well on a good note, if you want some sort of weird brassy yellow ombre hair (granted it might have not turned out like this for me if i could have just grin and bared it, but rather have weird hair than no hair and/or burns) and you wanna go through minutes of pure torture, go ahead and buy this bleach.&lt;br /&gt;This product really shouldn&#x27;t even get one star, or even a place on the store shelves. Save your money and you scalp and just stay far far away from this product.</li>
    <li> My hair is REALLY dark and this was my first time bleaching my hair/dying my hair on my own so I was kinda scared because of course bleaching and dying your hair can really damage it. But my first time went pretty well. However, my hair is SO dark that I might need to order another one to finish the job. It only turned my hair a brownish color instead of blonde as shown on the box. I will definitely use this product for any further bleaching needs I may have.</li>
    <li> really platinum white bright love it use all the time thx deb</li>
    <li> I hate it my hair was already blonde..wanted a more whiter look it turned my b hair orange and brassy then in some places a good white color of blonde???</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never bleached my hair before, but have bleached friends and families hair many times. This wasn&#x27;t bad, it wasn&#x27;t the best I&#x27;ve used but it is by far not the worst. It is not salon quality but for $9 I didn&#x27;t expect that.&lt;br /&gt;I had to use 2 bottles because the first bottle didn&#x27;t get to my roots or half of the back of my head. So I had to go buy another bottle to finish my hair. I have really long hair and sometimes one bottle of dye is enough sometimes it needs two so I was unsure with this if it would take one or two. The second box I bought was closed but it didn&#x27;t have the bleach packet so I returned it and got another one. I used the first one on my hair for 35 min. I waited 4 days and then I did the touch ups for 25 mins so that it didn&#x27;t over tax my hair. It didn&#x27;t burn except where it touched my skin but that is normal for any hair bleach and I kept a damp washcloth handy and just wiped it off. The scalp is sensitive so follow the directions and don&#x27;t rub it to your scalp and keep it 1/4 inch away when putting it on if you have to use a brush and if you feel it burning don&#x27;t  leave it on rinse it out right away so you don&#x27;t get chemical burns if you keep it away from your scalp you should be fine. Unless you are used to doing your own hair you should probably get someone to help you. The first bleach kit was smooth and went on perfectly while the second one clumped up and kept clogging the spout so I think it was just a bad batch. I have dark honey blonde hair with red highlights naturally and it is now a white blonde with copper and gold undertones. It didn&#x27;t hurt my hair even with the 2 treatments equaling 60 min. It is still healthy, shiny, and soft. Like with dying hair I rinsed it out completely with cool water and towel dried it then I washed my hair with shampoo, then I saturated my hair with conditioner and let it sit in it for 10 minutes before rinsing it out. The ones that I got didn&#x27;t have any conditioner in them so I used my own. If you just bleach your hair for any amount of time and don&#x27;t condition it by using a lot of conditioner and let it sit in it for at least 5 minutes your hair is more than likely to be brittle, split, dry or damaged. I just towel dry my hair and let it air dry the rest of the way by running a brush and my fingers through it to help it dry faster because blow driers heat the hair up and dry hair out and after bleaching it is more likely to add to any damage you have already inflicted on it by bleaching it. If I don&#x27;t have time to let it air dry and have to blow dry it I wash it two times after rinsing it completely to make sure all the bleach is out and do the 15 min conditioner treatment then blow dry it and whatever you do don&#x27;t wash your hair before bleaching it, preferably 2 days (you shouldn&#x27;t be washing your hair more than 2-3 times a week and when you get dirty and sweaty), the natural oils in your hair helps to protect your hair from damage if you wash it before bleaching it you take its defense away and can not bleach it for as long.t bleach your hair for any amount of time and don&#x27;t condition it by using a lot of conditioner and let it sit in it for at least 5 minutes your hair is more than likely to be brittle, split, dry or damaged.

    <li> First off, I&#x27;d like to say that this product may not work the same for everyone as it did for me. I have Very Fine hair (styled as a Mohawk no less) and I was born a natural Blonde that darkened as I got older.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the Box has a Optimum time, and I cut it in half because of my hair&#x27;s particular characteristics, And Within 15 minuets I had PLATINUM hair, Almost white! My friends who helped me with applying it were astonished, they looked at me and asked if it was okay, I laughed and Told them It was better than okay! It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now another point I want to make Is that I spotted this product in Wallmart when searching for a Color-correcting hair product. (unfortunate color choice I immediately regretted) Pulled it off the shelf, read a little, then I noticed the *NO AMMONIA* bit, And I never let that little Box out of my possession until it was being applied to my hair. &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it Does sting (most bleaches Do) but it also Came with a Nice packet of a Neutralizing agent to stop the Bleaching process when you&#x27;re done. KEEP IT ON YOUR HAIR FOR AT LEAST 6-8 HOURS It will help your hair recover more quickly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, In short, I have expressed my Pleasure at this product to everyone I know, and I think that they&#x27;re the reason I haven&#x27;t found it in Wallmart since!</li>
    <li> My hair is a dark brown almost black and it lifted it up to a light ash blonde without any red tones! worked great however it does lift fast so you have to work fast when applying it</li>
    <li> This stuff is BOMB! My hair color is around #1b... I only wanted to lift it about 4 shades to a nice dark golden color.. It took about an hour and I decided to rinse it out. The color was perfect. Then I decided I wanted halo highlights around the front of my hair so I purchased another box and left it on the hair I had previously bleached (for about 30 minutes) and it lifted to a beautiful ash blonde. I have never been able to get a natural looking ash blonde in my life not even at the hairdressers! Thats what made me sooo happy with this bleach. The thing I adore about this bleach is that upon mixing it, it turns into a tinted blue.. which means there won&#x27;t be an orangey/brassiness or red tones and I will not have to use a toner. I am very happy with this product. I normally use manic bleach but my hair always comes out orangy/yellow with that stuff. I am so happy I decided to try this!!!!! Also.. as dark as my hair was you&#x27;d think I&#x27;d have breakage but I haven&#x27;t seen any at all. I deep conditioned my hair directly afterwards and it turned out great!</li>
    <li> Got the acquired look but killed my scalp. Now I have not put any products on my hair for two months prior to this, there is no reason my scalp was on fire the way it was. I&#x27;ve bleached my hair several times in the past and has never experienced the feeling.&lt;br /&gt;I could be allergic to the product but this is a frequent issue in the buyers.</li>
    <li> I bought this at Walmart and believe me I was rather iffy on if it would work. Now I don&#x27;t know about other reviewers, but on the instruction sheet it does say you may need more then one supply of the product if you have long, and thick hair (Especially for dark colored hair). It also tells you how many quantities of the product you will need for you hair type. I only bought one, and my hair is originally a dark dark blonde. It completely bleached the top of my head (I was more focused on that area and put more on), and lightened the rest of my hair by five or six shades. Of course everyone is different. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product. It was well worth the money I paid for it.</li>
    <li> I bought this at out local Walmart, I&#x27;m pleased with the results (ended up being more of a sandy/teddy bear blond), and I imagine I will be more pleased after I dye it again with the bleach in a few days. The reason I only give it 4/5 stars and not 5/5, i had darker hair (was a dark blonde-medium brown), and after one time and whatever liquid we had left in the bottle for a second time of dying it (I don&#x27;t recommend doing it two times in one night like directed on the box, it frys your hair, and burns the hell out of your scalp) it is bleach blonde, but it has a slight brown/orange/teddy bear hair look to it.. And my scalp is still slightly tender from all the bleach being dumped on it.&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this product though! It&#x27;s great, and I&#x27;m sure it would be even better if done with a couple bottles of the bleach instead of one!&lt;br /&gt;Overall very satisfied!</li>
    <li> It is satisfactory.  I wish it was not a single use unit but multiple use.  However it gave excellent silver white after 3 applications.</li>
    <li> In the past I have always used Blue bleach from Sallys. It does the job, but not as quickly and intensly as splat. This was my first time using splat. My hair is naturally a light brown color. I was pleased to see that this has a blue base to minimize brassy tones. Word of caution, this stuff works fast, so try to work quickly applying. I have shoulder length, thick hair and had to use two bottles. This product worked excellent! It brought my hair up in only 25 minutes. The bleach mentioned above using 40 volume normally took 40 minutes.  I will mention you will probably need a toner after bleaching, mine had lots of yellow. I went to Sallys and bought wella t-14 which took all of the yellow out and gave me a gorgeous ultra light ash blonde. This also wasn&#x27;t as damaging to my hair as other bleaches I have used in the past. I&#x27;m now a splat customer for all my bleaching adventures.</li>
    <li> I should preface this by saying that I have bleached my hair a bunch of times before. I had never used Splat before but I ran out of my normal bleach and needed to do my roots so I picked this up. I mixed it properly while wearing gloves. While I was waiting the 1 minute for it to sit, I removed a glove to go grab my applicator brush and accidentally got the tiniest amount of powder on my finger. In the seconds it took to go rinse it off, my finger started to burn and it removed a layer of my skin. I shudder to think what would have happened if I actually put this stuff in my hair. Its possible I just have sensitive skin, but this has never happened with any other brand of bleach I have used.</li>
    <li> Turned my medium brown hair into an orangish yellowish color, used a toner afterwards, did not help at all. good thing im dying it pink over, or id be in a sticky situation.  If you want light blonde with silvery tones, this isnt the product you want, keep looking.</li>
    <li> It bleached my hair but not all the way? Black to brown/orange. Had to buy another one to make it blonde</li>
    <li> I have hair just past my shoulders (if that helps) and I used 2 bottles to remove professionally applied hair color.  I probably should&#x27;ve grabbed a 3rd bottle - if I could do things over again, I would&#x27;ve done so.  I definitely recommend keeping it on as long as possible (usually an hour or so) regardless of what the box says.  I posted before, bleached, &amp; after photos to help. This didn&#x27;t fry my hair at all!  I followed up using an all-natural coconut oil shampoo and a hot coconut oil treatment the next day just to help restore my hair and repair any possible damage (I prefer to be overly cautious so my hair never fries).  I hope this helps!</li>
    <li> To give you some background, before I used this particular lightening bleach, I had used Splat&#x27;s \\&quot;Lusty Lavendar\\&quot; a couple of times to make my hair purple. In that kit, they give you essentially the same bleach as they are selling here, to lighten your hair before you put the colour in. That bleach worked great at lightening my light-brown hair to a brassy blonde (as it was supposed to).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After having the purple for several months, I decided I wanted to go with a different colour. The idea was to bleach it blonde, use a brightening shampoo and conditioner, and end up with a platinum-blonde-ish colour that I could then use as a base for hair chalking. (I checked to make sure there would be no ill-effects if I bleached my purple hair) Bleaching my hair would also make it easier for me to change my hair colour again, once I got tired of the blonde. That was the plan anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We applied the bleach for the maximum time (about 1 hour), but the bleach did not take out all the purple. I ended up with this blonde-white-pink that was layered and not even uniform in colour. It wasn&#x27;t what I had planned on, but it actually looked very interesting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t want to put more bleach in my hair, for fear that it would make my hair fried beyond hope. So now I have the most unique hair colour I think I&#x27;ve ever seen. So, if you have a crazy hair colour, keep in mind that you may not end up with what you were planning on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit also included a shampoo and conditioner to apply after the bleach has been rinsed out. I thought that was a very good idea. My hair definitely felt finer after using this bleach, so I wanted to make sure it was nourished properly ASAP. That is exactly what the provided shampoo and conditioner is for.</li>
    <li> Got this for my girlfriend who dies her hair every few months and simply put it didn&#x27;t work. Her hair did lighten, but lightening doesn&#x27;t cut it when you&#x27;re putting in color. There was still a lot of places in her hair which barely changed color, and yes she knows how to cover all of her hair with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; We will not be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this bleach twice in my life, once when I dyed a strip of my hair bright pink back in 2010 and yesterday, when I used the bleach on my entire head to recolor it cherry brown. My hair is naturally black and when I used it on virgin hair the first go, it worked perfectly after two applications. It bleached my virgin black hair to a pale blonde. However, when I used it on dyed hair yesterday, it didn&#x27;t work too well. I dyed my hair blue black and decided I wanted a change so I tried to lighten it with this and, after one hour, it only turned a strange brassy brown color. So when I tried a second application it lightened it a tad bit more to a dark orange. I was hoping that it would turn my hair blonde so that my cherry red color was more noticeable but, unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t work too well. So, if you are using this on dark, dyed hair, this likely won&#x27;t work for you.</li>
    <li> I have used a lot of different bleaching product over the years and this is by far the most effective and fast acting.  That being said though you should be cautioned that it does work very fast.  So, if you have long hair you have to move very fast to get even coverage.</li>
