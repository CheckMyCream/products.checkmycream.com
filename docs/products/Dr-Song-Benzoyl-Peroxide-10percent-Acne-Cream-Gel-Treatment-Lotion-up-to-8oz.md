      <li>When I ran put of BP I hopped on Amazon to order more when I ran across Dr. Song&#x27;s products.</li>
      <li>Such an excellent product, I must say.</li>
      <li>I opt for Dr. Song all the time, 100%, because their products are outstanding for their budgeted price.  </li>
      <li>Arrived quickly and was nicely wrapped I bought</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t really say if the product is good or not.</li>
      <li>It has made a HUGE difference in my skin.</li>
      <li>and I see a huge improvement.</li>
      <li>because the level of respect and what appears to be a genuine concern for customer satisfaction is what convinced me that this is on the up-and-up...</li>
      <li>it leave my skin feeling so smooth with no residue...and</li>
      <li>Furthermore I suffer from back acne this and the combination of mixing sea salt in a water bottle is the perfect regiment, noticeably more clear I also apply to my face does not dry out and is very smooth.</li>
      <li>I have been using the full Acne.org regimen for almost 2 years.</li>
      <li>This product has helped tremendously with my problematic skin.  </li>
      <li>My acne has cleared tremendously.</li>
      <li>the price for the quantity was worth dipping my toe in the pool...</li>
      <li>It may not work as well for everyone, but it&#x27;s worth a shot compared to some of the pricier, big-name brands out there.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s worth it</li>
      <li>I like this product because it kept me from breaking out, its economical and it lasts longer than clearisil which is</li>
      <li>Everything was great for the first month and then at the 1 month mark, underneath my chin and down my neck started breaking.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not heavy on the skin either, very light and smooth and it even smells decent.  </li>
      <li>However this right here is heavenly.</li>
      <li>and then i put a nice layer of this on and let it dry.</li>
      <li>Works really well, and quickly.</li>
      <li>Definitely buying again :)</li>
      <li>Plus, it comes in a very generous size!</li>
      <li>Fast shipping!</li>
      <li>bottle to make sure it was gong to work because I have been using a prescribed cream that only has 5% Benzoyl Peroxide</li>
      <li>This one helps to quickly reduce the size of blemishes and completely gets rid of them within 3-5 days.</li>
      <li>BIG mistake, HUGE.</li>
      <li>It is very watery and smells like sun screen.</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t want to use that word...COMPANY...</li>
      <li>my skin looks so much clearer since using this</li>
      <li>, It works very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This has really helped my hormonal acne</li>
      <li>acne cream can be very drying when too much is used or if used too often.</li>
      <li>so it didn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
      <li>Most other brands come in .5 - 1 oz tubes.</li>
      <li>This is a good product strong so use carefully can cause extreme drying but overall worked saw a difference after a day</li>
      <li>You&#x27;re better off with a sulfur spot treatment for cysts (I like [[ASIN:B000NNL7FG Clearasil Daily Clear Tinted Adult Treatment Cream]]).&lt;br</li>
      <li>I tried using it under my moisturizer, but it was drying out my skin too much, which in the long run will only create more breakouts.</li>
      <li>highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>No new spots since starting this product and the spots I already had have gone down greatly or disappeared altogether.</li>
      <li>If you only get acne cysts though, then this may not be right for you.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m talking 3-4 new spots each day.</li>
      <li>At first, I was a bit leery about using Dr. Song because nothing worked (not even the extra strength Proactiv).</li>
      <li>I actually thought I was getting more for less.</li>
      <li>I was looking for something to dry up the sides of my nose where I keep getting zit buildup from very large pores.  </li>
      <li>my face is com0pletely clear after two threee.aplications</li>
      <li>Works well to keep your face clear.</li>
      <li>I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
      <li>and it wasn&#x27;t work fast enough.</li>
      <li>I use this brands 2% acne cream daily, and find that when the occasional breakout occurs- it is helpful to use the 10% right away to help kill any bacteria that&#x27;s causing the breakout.  </li>
      <li>Ii does not dry out my skin, and keeps me clear!</li>
      <li>I still have the dark spots (blemishes), and I hope over time it will faded, but Dr. Song lotion definitely is better and quicker than any other beauty product I&#x27;ve used in regards to acne.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it did much for my skin besides make it dry</li>
      <li>It only took 2-3 applications (once per night) for my problem areas to clear up completely.</li>
      <li>Yes, my skin is SUPER dry, but I&#x27;ll take dry skin over pimple covered skin any day.</li>
      <li>and I can barely move my neck.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in so much pain and am mortified about being seen in public, which is pretty damn hard</li>
      <li>and I haven&#x27;t had a major breakout since using this for several weeks.</li>
      <li>and I see a big difference compared to other name brand products this really keeps the majority of breakouts away</li>
      <li>Good product, especially when compared to other expensive brands such as acne.org</li>
      <li>I held course and continued to use the product changing to every other night with no BP in the morning and new spots kept cropping up on a daily basis.</li>

<li> Gentler than other 10% solutions I&#x27;ve tried, but with similar results.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Excellent!  Will order more</li>
    <li> I bought this based off the reviews I read. I used it for a few weeks just to give it time and this product is one of those &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34;. Nothing changed after using it, my acne didn&#x27;t go away and it also didn&#x27;t give me acne. Save your money and try something else I promise you&#x27;ll be a lot happier!</li>
    <li> One bottle lasts me 3 months. Such an excellent product, I must say. My acne has cleared tremendously. I follow the &amp;#34;Acne.org&amp;#34; regime, deciding not to purchase their expensive products. I opt for Dr. Song all the time, 100%, because their products are outstanding for their budgeted price.  *UPDATE: 6/22/15  I reviewed the wrong product. I use the 2.5% Benzoyl Peroxide gel by Dr. Song</li>
    <li> Love this product! I have been using the full Acne.org regimen for almost 2 years. When I ran put of BP I hopped on Amazon to order more when I ran across Dr. Song&#x27;s products. The price + shipping between the two brands was enough to get me to try Dr. Song. I have always used 2.5% BP and so wish I would have tried 10% sooner. It has made a HUGE difference in my skin. No new spots since starting this product and the spots I already had have gone down greatly or disappeared altogether. Yes, my skin is SUPER dry, but I&#x27;ll take dry skin over pimple covered skin any day. Plus, I think my skin will adjust around the 1 month mark (have only been using for 2 weeks). So, I use Dr. Song&#x27;s 2.5% BP in the morning and his 10% at night with Cerve moisturizer and Cerve hydrating cleanser. Works like a charm!    Update 03/01/2015:   I have recently stopped using this product and have gone back to only using Dr. Song&#x27;s 2.5% BP at night. Everything was great for the first month and then at the 1 month mark, underneath my chin and down my neck started breaking. I&#x27;m talking 3-4 new spots each day. I held course and continued to use the product changing to every other night with no BP in the morning and new spots kept cropping up on a daily basis. It looks horrid. Add that on top of how drying the 10% BP is and I can barely move my neck. I&#x27;m in so much pain and am mortified about being seen in public, which is pretty damn hard considering I work in outside sales. I wish I had never used this product. My recommendation is to only use as a spot treatment and to never put it on an area that you do not currently have a breakout. I thought I was being preventative by applying is under my chin and down my neck (places I have been known to breakout in the past), BIG mistake, HUGE.</li>
    <li> Ii does not dry out my skin, and keeps me clear!</li>
    <li> my skin looks so much clearer since using this I&#x27;ve been using this as part of my routine and I see a big difference compared to other name brand products this really keeps the majority of breakouts away</li>
    <li> Great product. Works well to keep your face clear.</li>
    <li> I stop using this, and forgot why. I think it did a great job from my knowledge.</li>
    <li> This works better than most over the counter acne medication. First I would like to say that I was not sure about it but however I&#x27;m going to be making a future purchase definitely. Furthermore I suffer from back acne this and the combination of mixing sea salt in a water bottle is the perfect regiment, noticeably more clear I also apply to my face does not dry out and is very smooth. Arrived quickly and was nicely wrapped I bought the 2 oz goes a long way!</li>
    <li> one of the most effective acne cream ive eVer tried! !my face is com0pletely clear after two threee.aplications</li>
    <li> I only brought the 2 oz bottle to test it and it did a good job getting rid of my cystic acne. I went to the dermatologist for a shot on them, but it only reduced the size of the acne but it was still there. I tried this and it reduced it to the point of almost gone. I only have two acne spots so I don&#x27;t need to use a lot of it when I apply it to the affected areas.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this twice already and by the next morning it had almost totally cleared up each spot on my skin.  I know nothing works for everyone but this acne cream is by far the best I have ever used.  It&#x27;s not heavy on the skin either, very light and smooth and it even smells decent.  Will definitely look to buy again in the future.</li>
    <li> Tried it for a week and no change to my face. It is very watery and smells like sun screen. It might work for others but did not work for me.</li>
    <li> Skeptical due to past buying experiences of various products for acne prone skin but very pleased overall. Fast shipping! Great seller!! Love the product! Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> It made my acene disappear BUT I hate that it dries up my face. The bottle says use it 3 times a day and I am not going to do that I&#x27;m going to use it once one week or two. It makes my face itchy :c but it&#x27;s worth it</li>
    <li> I use this brands 2% acne cream daily, and find that when the occasional breakout occurs- it is helpful to use the 10% right away to help kill any bacteria that&#x27;s causing the breakout.  To avoid any dryness or skin irritation, I only use this product as needed. Works wonders!</li>
    <li> After reading reviews I thought I would give it a try.  After trying it a week I still have breakouts!! DON&#x27;T BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Good formula, nice and silky unlike the cream you find int he store. It did seem like it took a long time to arrive, but it was during the hilidays so maybe that was it. Alo, it came in a squeeze bottle and not a pump, although it WAS 2oz so it didn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
    <li> I had ran-out of my post PROACTIV benzoyl-peroxide substitute and as usually raced to amazon to stock-up.  Amazon&#x27;s search engine brought up this Dr. SONG benzoyl-peroxide...thing ...with this ridiculous  price...I though this has got to be some kin-a- scam... I read the description...at the time, there was very little if any reviews... I could not believe what I had found ...a benzoyl-peroxide treatment  at 10% and the price for the quantity was worth dipping my toe in the pool...the need to satisfy my curiosity WAS ON!!!.  I ordered 2 of Dr. Song&#x27;s products, the 8 oz. and the 2 oz. Acne Cream.  One for home and one for on -the- go-....  purse-size.  I was so pleased that it was odorless, soothing to the skin and it did not dry-out my skin.  I waited for a few weeks to see if  my skin would have any adverse reactions to the formulation.  I had no allergic reaction. I am always so pleased to use this cream it leave my skin feeling so smooth with no residue...and me with no anxiety.  I don&#x27;t&#x27; know what you&#x27;re doing Dr. Song, but, whatever it is KEEP DOING IT.  YOUR Prices are AWSOME!!!....ESPECIALLY for what you deliver.  THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU.  In addition, I got a follow-up e-mail from A----n who appears to be with Dr. Songs company.....I really don&#x27;t want to use that word...COMPANY...because the level of respect and what appears to be a genuine concern for customer satisfaction is what convinced me that this is on the up-and-up...AND IT&#x27;S A KEEPER.  I WILL BE USING MORE OF Dr. Song&#x27;s products from this point forward.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something to dry up the sides of my nose where I keep getting zit buildup from very large pores.  In a couple of weeks the product seems to have shrunk my pores and the zit material is not accumulating--at least as fast.  It may or may not have been what I should be using but it seems to be doing what I thought it might do--drying up and closing pores.  If anyone knows what else I can use in addition to to this product, let me know.  Something to stop the pores from filling up with oil...</li>
    <li> excellent cream.  highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Works just as it stated it would - what a nice surprise</li>
    <li> I ordered a 2 oz. bottle to make sure it was gong to work because I have been using a prescribed cream that only has 5% Benzoyl Peroxide and it wasn&#x27;t work fast enough. This 10% acne cream is working faster and its less $ than my prescription and I&#x27;ve only been using it for 5 days! Fallow instructions and apply a small amount, you will see and feel a difference &#x3D;-)</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t really say if the product is good or not. Won&#x27;t be using it as it came unsealed.</li>
    <li> The product works great!</li>
    <li> I love how benzoyl peroxide clears my acne. It is hard to find products with over %5 benzoyl peroxide. This product has the perfect concentrate of it.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, great deal.</li>
    <li> Good product, especially when compared to other expensive brands such as acne.org</li>
    <li> This has really helped my hormonal acne and I can wear much less make up!</li>
    <li> After two days of using this product my skin was too dry. I don&#x27;t think it did much for my skin besides make it dry</li>
    <li> This product has helped tremendously with my problematic skin.  My skin is smoother and I only have occasional singular pimples instead of continual multitudes of them.</li>
    <li> I like this product because it kept me from breaking out, its economical and it lasts longer than clearisil which is more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice it being a litle gritty but It did not bother me at all, I like products that work and despite the grittyness pardon my spelling if its wrong, It works very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes I would recommed it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m taking off one star for the packaging being misleading. I actually thought I was getting more for less. The bottle shown resembles Dan&#x27;s BP which I think quit working for me forever ago. I was a faithful user of Dans BP. However this right here is heavenly. It&#x27;s way better. I have suffered troubled skin for more than 20 yrs and I haven&#x27;t had a major breakout since using this for several weeks. Can be over drying according to other products you may use and I have extremely oily skin but this works. I hope this product stays around and that I never go back to Dans. Please please please change the picture. I was disappointed at the size I received. If I knew it were so small I would&#x27;ve ordered more. However excellent product. BTW I only use this at night. I wash with purpose soap, lotion with alba acne in the green and white tube and then i put a nice layer of this on and let it dry. It works!!!</li>
    <li> 10% Benzoyl Peroxide Acne Cream up to 8oz Dr Song  good product like Rx</li>
    <li> This works wonders! I use it every day 3 times a day and I see a huge improvement. Definitely buying again :)</li>
    <li> This is a good product strong so use carefully can cause extreme drying but overall worked saw a difference after a day</li>
    <li> I bought this cream because I had some sores or pimples on my scalp that just wouldn&#x27;t heal. I tried the 5% that my wife got from her doctor and it worked great for about two months. Then it stopped working. I odered the 10% and it did the trick. Now I can say &amp;#34;No more sores&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Works really well, and quickly. It only took 2-3 applications (once per night) for my problem areas to clear up completely. I have extremely sensitive skin and this didn&#x27;t burn or dry me out at all, which was a problem with Proactive. It may not work as well for everyone, but it&#x27;s worth a shot compared to some of the pricier, big-name brands out there.</li>
    <li> At first, I was a bit leery about using Dr. Song because nothing worked (not even the extra strength Proactiv). However, I&#x27;ve been using Dr. Song for two weeks, and already my face feels nice and smooth. I still have the dark spots (blemishes), and I hope over time it will faded, but Dr. Song lotion definitely is better and quicker than any other beauty product I&#x27;ve used in regards to acne.</li>
    <li> Came in different bottle or tube if you can call like that..</li>
    <li> This is one of the best 10% BP acne creams I&#x27;ve tried. Plus, it comes in a very generous size! Most other brands come in .5 - 1 oz tubes. I purchased the 2 oz and it&#x27;s definitely worth the money because it will last at least 2 months. Next time I&#x27;ll probably get the larger size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trust me, I&#x27;ve tried plenty acne creams and 75% of them have had little to no effect on my skin. This one helps to quickly reduce the size of blemishes and completely gets rid of them within 3-5 days. I also get hormonal cysts and those do take longer to go away. Not much is going to work on those topically. This seems to help a little bit with those - the go away faster than usual. If you only get acne cysts though, then this may not be right for you. You&#x27;re better off with a sulfur spot treatment for cysts (I like [[ASIN:B000NNL7FG Clearasil Daily Clear Tinted Adult Treatment Cream]]).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This acne cream can be very drying when too much is used or if used too often. Be sure to use a thin layer and just on the broken out area. I used this twice a day on top of my moisturizer. I tried using it under my moisturizer, but it was drying out my skin too much, which in the long run will only create more breakouts. You don&#x27;t want that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
    <li> Gentler than other 10% solutions I&#x27;ve tried, but with similar results.</li>
