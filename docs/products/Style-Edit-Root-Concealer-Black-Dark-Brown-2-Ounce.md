      <li>Great coverage and easy to use.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>She is able to go a week or two longer before heading to the Salon.</li>
      <li>#34;need it&amp;#34;. :)</li>
      <li>I would love that I didn&#x27;t &amp;</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>This one somehow leaves my hair still manageable and able to be styled.</li>
      <li>better than hair mascaras that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>, what I love is that it doesn&#x27;t make the area I&#x27;ve sprayed sticky afterward.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I was very excited when my salon lady suggested this product.</li>
      <li>Awesome stuff to color grey in between hair dyes</li>
      <li>There are better products available than this brand.  </li>
      <li>My grays really need to be colored every two weeks, but who has the time (or money), so this root concealer has become my new best friend.  </li>
      <li>Try not to brush hair after using as it brushes out easily.</li>
      <li>This will leave color/stain on face, hands, clothing, walls, so watch wear you spray (however, it wipes off easily).  </li>
      <li>Great to cover the few nagging greys between coloring.</li>
      <li>Just check what you get as they obviously have some kind of labeling problem at the warehouse.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Update : This product does not last for more than 5-6 times of use.</li>
      <li>I did not realize it at first but thought the color was off.  </li>
      <li>The can is bigger than the advertised on TV brand and it covers better, therefore using less.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Covers really really well</li>
      <li>Last batch I bought was from another mfg and way too light.</li>
      <li>Also, my eyes were burning way too much after I washed my hair day after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and the price is reasonable.</li>
      <li>Works great but the only problem is it does not last long.  </li>
      <li>It sprays on easily and blends naturally with my existing color, covering my roots until I can make it back to the salon.  </li>
      <li>It took a bit to figure out how to spray with out to much mess, but once she got that down - she is happy that she found this product.</li>
      <li>search for more natural and less harmful product continues.</li>
      <li>but no trouble in the rain.</li>
      <li>and it even lasts quite well with washing weekly as it doesn&#x27;t completely wash out</li>
      <li>When I order them now, I make sure I get at least 3 or 4 at a time to save on shipping...</li>
      <li>color stays on until the next wash and it hardly even rubs off on your hands when it is fairly fresh.</li>

<li> It covers my gray hair completely without making a mess.</li>
<li> It kind of &amp;#34;stains&amp;#34; your roots so even after you wash it out, your roots aren&#x27;t as bad as it would be without the product.</li>
<li> I have been covering my grays using hair color for so long and was hoping to have workaround option to prolong the frequency of hair</li>
<li> Hides the grey hairs and fills in the thinning spots on the scalp.</li>
<li> new packaging lately but same product.</li>
<li> Once dry (in seconds)</li>
<li> it never comes off on anything  unless you wet your hair.....</li>
<li> I wanted it to cover some thin hair spots which it did not do, so maybe my expectations were too high.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried other root concealer sprays which make all of the sprayed hairs clump together.  </li>
<li> This is too dark for me</li>
<li> You will have dark spots appear suspiciously on your nose and face.</li>
<li> I always get the darkest because my hair is naturally black.  </li>
<li> I have thin hair and have grays only in temple area.</li>
<li> But I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday.</li>
<li> However, I am not totally sure how less harmful this product is over using permanent hair color.</li>
<li> Have a stiff feeling, but covers grays well</li>
<li> so I use very little.  </li>
<li> This may conceal, but it is also destroying your hair!!</li>
<li> I think this works well and does not smell bad so this will save me when I don&#x27;t have time to color my roots.  </li>
<li> I tried this product and hated it.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works great but the only problem is it does not last long.  I&#x27;m talking about the spray itself.  It only last me about a week and I only spray a lil.  Wish it was in a bigger can.</li>
    <li> This product is easy to use and works great for in-between colors.  Just spray the area you want covered and it will work immediately.  I wish I would have known about this root concealer awhile ago.  It would have saved me some money not having to go to my stylist for a color so soon.  Where has this been all my life?!</li>
    <li> I think this works well and does not smell bad so this will save me when I don&#x27;t have time to color my roots.  Covers the gray well and blends in with my haircolor.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product.  She is able to go a week or two longer before heading to the Salon. It took a bit to figure out how to spray with out to much mess, but once she got that down - she is happy that she found this product.</li>
    <li> The best product I have used for root touch ups between coloring.</li>
    <li> I love this spray!  It has saved me from showing my gray roots a lot of times and it has helped me extend my salon touch up to 5 or even 6 weeks in between... When I order them now, I make sure I get at least 3 or 4 at a time to save on shipping...</li>
    <li> great root concealer. better than hair mascaras that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> OMG - who would ever bottle flammable contents and tell you to spray it on your hair!!  This may conceal, but it is also destroying your hair!!</li>
    <li> Good for emergencies.</li>
    <li> I am truly grateful for this product. Just to use on certain small areas between coloring has made the world of difference .</li>
    <li> Hides root and make hair look fuller as well. If your hair is thinning it is great!</li>
    <li> This product has saved me a lot of money between hair appointments. It also can help hairlines appear &amp;#34;thicker&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> As good as it gets between salon appointments! Def should try it those grays are showing!&#x27;</li>
    <li> Works great in a pinch between hair colorings. Just be mindful if you pull your hair back with reading or sunglasses. You will have dark spots appear suspiciously on your nose and face. Lol</li>
    <li> I wanted it to cover some thin hair spots which it did not do, so maybe my expectations were too high.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Keeps the roots from being seen, although it does get sticky. But I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday. It kind of &amp;#34;stains&amp;#34; your roots so even after you wash it out, your roots aren&#x27;t as bad as it would be without the product. I love it. I would love that I didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;need it&amp;#34;. :)</li>
    <li> I tried this product and hated it.  It felt like I spray painted my hair with that junk you use at Halloween.</li>
    <li> Last batch I bought was from another mfg and way too light. This is too dark for me but if I were a brunette it would be perfect. I also got the Medium Brown which is perfect for me - a honey-highlighted blonde with brownish roots. Covers really really well and the price is reasonable.</li>
    <li> It is a great product. I love it.</li>
    <li> Great coverage and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years....new packaging lately but same product. I couldn&#x27;t go without it between coloring and it even lasts quite well with washing weekly as it doesn&#x27;t completely wash out so I use very little.  I always get the darkest because my hair is naturally black.  Once dry (in seconds) it never comes off on anything  unless you wet your hair.....but no trouble in the rain.</li>
    <li> There are better products available than this brand.  This will leave color/stain on face, hands, clothing, walls, so watch wear you spray (however, it wipes off easily).  Try not to brush hair after using as it brushes out easily.</li>
    <li> This is a great product which is the best I have found for in between colors.  However, I did not get the color I ordered.  The label that is stuck on the can says black-brown (which is what I ordered) but the can itself says auburn-red.  I did not want to bother returning it.  I did not realize it at first but thought the color was off.  Just check what you get as they obviously have some kind of labeling problem at the warehouse.</li>
    <li> I received the product promptly and it was packaged well. But when I went to use it this morning, it wouldn&#x27;t work. The nozzle was broke.</li>
    <li> This is the best root concealer, I have ever used. It covers my gray hair completely without making a mess.</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff to color grey in between hair dyes</li>
    <li> This works great. The can is bigger than the advertised on TV brand and it covers better, therefore using less.&lt;br /&gt;The color stays on until the next wash and it hardly even rubs off on your hands when it is fairly fresh.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Hides the grey hairs and fills in the thinning spots on the scalp.</li>
    <li> My grays really need to be colored every two weeks, but who has the time (or money), so this root concealer has become my new best friend.  It sprays on easily and blends naturally with my existing color, covering my roots until I can make it back to the salon.  The trick is to not hold the bottle too close to the area you&#x27;re trying to cover while spraying it (otherwise it will target your scalp and leave the color there).  I hold it about 6-8&amp;#34; away from my roots and move it in a brush stroke pattern while spraying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, what I love is that it doesn&#x27;t make the area I&#x27;ve sprayed sticky afterward.  I&#x27;ve tried other root concealer sprays which make all of the sprayed hairs clump together.  This one somehow leaves my hair still manageable and able to be styled.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It&#x27;s perfect for touching up my hair color on the go when I am overdue for coloring.</li>
    <li> Great to cover the few nagging greys between coloring. Allows me to go to 6 weeks instead of 4.</li>
    <li> I have been covering my grays using hair color for so long and was hoping to have workaround option to prolong the frequency of hair color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very excited when my salon lady suggested this product. However, I am not totally sure how less harmful this product is over using permanent hair color. Also, my eyes were burning way too much after I washed my hair day after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My search for more natural and less harmful product continues. I don&#x27;t believe I will buy this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update : This product does not last for more than 5-6 times of use. I have thin hair and have grays only in temple area.</li>
    <li> Gives great coverage over gray areas.  Have a stiff feeling, but covers grays well</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an amazing product!</li>
