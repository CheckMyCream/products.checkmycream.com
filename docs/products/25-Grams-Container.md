      <li>This product is the BEST!</li>
      <li>This product is the best!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very, very happy.</li>
      <li>how great it works</li>
      <li>Great product and just what I needed to cover some thinning areas in my hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not that great .</li>
      <li>great coverage...</li>
      <li>I like the color match even better!!  </li>
      <li>Amazing!</li>
      <li>love the stuff and very good service</li>
      <li>product sells itself, it is truly that good.  </li>
      <li>I love the sealable packaging!</li>
      <li>Not my first order, it is wonderful.</li>
      <li>its amazing</li>
      <li>Very easy to use and apply.</li>
      <li>Just put in your own container, I used my own Toppik container and it worked fine.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like a powder sitting on top of your hair , I won&#x27;t order again no way , sandy in cali</li>
      <li>I started out using a product that brushes onto my scalp, but this product works so much better for me.  </li>
      <li>and now I feel so confident I don&#x27;t have to worry about people looking at me</li>
      <li>Still a nice cheap alternative</li>
      <li>I ended up giving some away to my clients and needed more for myself!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>I love the toppik brand, but not by Samson.</li>
      <li>This is a way better value than buying the Toppik bottles.  </li>
      <li>Noticed more in my hair than scalp that you get with the others.</li>
      <li>but I think Toppik brand is better</li>
      <li>This company has great prices and fast shipping.</li>
      <li>Works great for thinning hair but not so much if you are going bald.</li>
      <li>Used this product for over a year and love it.</li>
      <li>It lays on top of your hair in balls and some of it falls out during the day.  </li>
      <li>Their product is as good as Toppik (I can’t tell the difference) but at a MUCH more reasonable price.  </li>
      <li>X-Fusion costs more but it falls to your scalp and you can lightly comb hair over the powder to conceal it.</li>
      <li>I buy the refills and use my old Toppik dispenser for the application and it works great.  </li>
      <li>I have fine thinning hair and use this product with the spray/pump applicator.  </li>
      <li>It does work well and adheres to my hair just fine.</li>
      <li>the topic fibers covered up my huge mistake.</li>
      <li>so I plan on a long and happy business relationship with them.</li>
      <li>Losing hair is traumatic, but this product makes me look like I have a full head of hair.</li>
      <li>This is a true brown and doesn&#x27;t have that greenish cast to it like the Toppik brand does.  </li>
      <li>Quickly delivery, product as described.</li>
      <li>The only problem I have is the container top can&#x27;t be taken off too many times because it starts not to stick on.  </li>
      <li>Keratin Research always provides quick and efficient delivery on or before the estimated delivery date</li>
      <li>At first I thought it was to light (as in weight).</li>
      <li>i had to buy a new applicator and just threw most of this stuff away.</li>
      <li>This is my second package, the first one was so good</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Toppik for several years and was excited to find a more affordable alternative.  </li>
      <li>It is a great replacement that works as well as those more expensive fibers.</li>
      <li>It may work better in a different container.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!!</li>
      <li>By purchasing the refills I saved even more money and get the same results.</li>
      <li>This is the first thing I pack when traveling also.</li>
      <li>At first I thought this was toppik brand</li>
      <li>the only draw back is that it comes in an envelope, not a shaker like Toppik, but I just used my empty Toppik one and it works great!</li>
      <li>Its much cheaper than the more expensive brands online and does just as good.</li>
      <li>A lot of the product fell because it was so lite, covered a lot of my face, and when I wiped with a wet bath clothe, it stuck to my face, so its better to wipe first with a tissue and then scrub the rest off.</li>
      <li>&amp;#34;Been spending to much until now.</li>
      <li>I have been using Toppik for a while and found it to be very costly so tried Samson&#x27;s version</li>
      <li>hair fiber was to lite, did not stick very well.</li>
      <li>and it worked just as well at a much lower cost.</li>
      <li>However, it is very light-weighted and will not fall to your scalp.  </li>
      <li>I used  to buy it for her at the store, but it is so much cheaper to buy the refill.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had quite a few disasters when the top falls off as I&#x27;m shaking it in my hair, spilling the whole bottle on my head and clothes!</li>
      <li>I have used Toppik’s hair building fibers for a few years now and was pleased to learn that there was an alternative to their high prices.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
      <li>Messy and takes 3x as much as Toppik for adequate coverage.</li>
      <li>Overall I really like this product.</li>
      <li>The fibers visually looked a little different and the toppik ones look like the stood &amp;#34;erect&amp;#34; more where as these lay flatter.  </li>

<li> I have found if I keep the container at least 3/4 full of powder it alleviates little puffs of air that leaves a bare spot where powder should be.</li>
<li> Refills last a long time too!</li>
<li> Solution - keep your empty Toppik bottles and fill them with this - it&#x27;s the same stuff!</li>
<li> It tends to cake on the scalp after a long sweaty workout.</li>
<li> It not only hides where my hair is thinning, but gives me a little protection from the sun for short outings.  </li>
<li> Works just as well as other brands.</li>
<li> Just fill up your empty bottles !</li>
<li> this works just as well at half the price.  </li>
<li> This product looks and acts like XFusion and Topik at half the price.</li>
<li> I use a little spray to hold it in place.  </li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
<li> My medium brown looked green, it did not work AT ALL in the Toppik dispenser as a refill, as they said it would.  </li>
<li> if you use the little nozzle applicator, do not buy this product!  </li>
<li> I tired this as a less expensive alternative to Toppik, and was pleasantly surprised!</li>
<li> very disappointed by the quality of the product.&lt;br /&gt;Tried many brands.</li>
<li> Color not nice</li>
<li> It works just as well, if not better at a fraction of the cost!</li>
<li> I used an existing Toppik container and had a very hard time getting this product to dispense from that container.</li>
<li> This refill kit is unfortunately the worse.</li>
<li> I like this product, but i chose the wrong color.  </li>
<li> Looks fake.</li>
<li> My hair has been thinning and I hate trying to cover it up by combing.</li>
<li> But, this product is horrible.  </li>
<li> Horrible.</li>

    <li> This product looks and acts like XFusion and Topik at half the price. The only problem I have is the container top can&#x27;t be taken off too many times because it starts not to stick on.  I&#x27;ve had quite a few disasters when the top falls off as I&#x27;m shaking it in my hair, spilling the whole bottle on my head and clothes!</li>
    <li> If this is all you can afford, then it will help cover balding areas.  However, it is very light-weighted and will not fall to your scalp.  It lays on top of your hair in balls and some of it falls out during the day.  X-Fusion costs more but it falls to your scalp and you can lightly comb hair over the powder to conceal it.</li>
    <li> Great product and just what I needed to cover some thinning areas in my hair. I highly recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not that great . It&#x27;s like a powder sitting on top of your hair , I won&#x27;t order again no way , sandy in cali</li>
    <li> Messy and takes 3x as much as Toppik for adequate coverage. I went back to Toppik.</li>
    <li> Amazing! I am a Toppik User but this Product is the Same</li>
    <li> Works just as well as other brands. The fact that it&#x27;s a refill saves me lots of money.</li>
    <li> Quickly delivery, product as described.</li>
    <li> hair fiber was to lite, did not stick very well. A lot of the product fell because it was so lite, covered a lot of my face, and when I wiped with a wet bath clothe, it stuck to my face, so its better to wipe first with a tissue and then scrub the rest off. It looked like whiskers was on my face and also looked tinted because I use med. brown.  I love the toppik brand, but not by Samson.</li>
    <li> This is a way better value than buying the Toppik bottles.  Solution - keep your empty Toppik bottles and fill them with this - it&#x27;s the same stuff!</li>
    <li> I like this product, but i chose the wrong color.  I need to get the lighter shade of brown next time.  It does work well and adheres to my hair just fine.</li>
    <li> great coverage...I had clipped my hair with clippers and made a big oops...the topic fibers covered up my huge mistake.</li>
    <li> This is a product that my aunt just loves! I used  to buy it for her at the store, but it is so much cheaper to buy the refill. Just fill up your empty bottles ! Refills last a long time too!</li>
    <li> I tired this as a less expensive alternative to Toppik, and was pleasantly surprised! It works just as well, if not better at a fraction of the cost! the only draw back is that it comes in an envelope, not a shaker like Toppik, but I just used my empty Toppik one and it works great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Toppik for several years and was excited to find a more affordable alternative.  But, this product is horrible.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  My medium brown looked green, it did not work AT ALL in the Toppik dispenser as a refill, as they said it would.  Horrible.</li>
    <li> This has become a part of my routine and my hair feels and looks fuller, healthier with every use.  This is the first thing I pack when traveling also.</li>
    <li> At first I thought this was toppik brand but it wasn&#x27;t.  The fibers visually looked a little different and the toppik ones look like the stood &amp;#34;erect&amp;#34; more where as these lay flatter.  Still a nice cheap alternative but I think Toppik brand is better</li>
    <li> This product is the BEST! I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do with out it its amazing how great it works I had low self esteem about my hair and now I feel so confident I don&#x27;t have to worry about people looking at me I&#x27;m soo thankful foe this product is realy has changed my life</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well as Toppik or Xfusion. I used an existing Toppik container and had a very hard time getting this product to dispense from that container. It may work better in a different container. Also, the color was a bit lighter than the \\&quot;Medium Brown\\&quot; from Toppik/Xfusion.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and apply. Refill is plentiful.</li>
    <li> Works just as well as the &#x27;name brand&#x27; Toppik product - and I like the color match even better!!  This is a true brown and doesn&#x27;t have that greenish cast to it like the Toppik brand does.  I won&#x27;t buy anything else from now on.</li>
    <li> Losing hair is traumatic, but this product makes me look like I have a full head of hair. I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> very disappointed by the quality of the product.&lt;br /&gt;Tried many brands. This refill kit is unfortunately the worse. Looks fake. Color not nice</li>
    <li> I have been using Toppik for a while and found it to be very costly so tried Samson&#x27;s version and it worked just as well at a much lower cost. By purchasing the refills I saved even more money and get the same results.</li>
    <li> I have fine thinning hair and use this product with the spray/pump applicator.  I would be lost without this product.  It not only hides where my hair is thinning, but gives me a little protection from the sun for short outings.  I started out using a product that brushes onto my scalp, but this product works so much better for me.  You just sprinkle the powder onto the roots.  I use a little spray to hold it in place.  The applicator makes the application simple.  The applicator helps me with even application.  I have read reviews about the applicator not working after a while.  I have found if I keep the container at least 3/4 full of powder it alleviates little puffs of air that leaves a bare spot where powder should be.</li>
    <li> love the stuff and very good service</li>
    <li> Have used more expensive brands - this works just as well at half the price.  Kudo&#x27;s to you.  Will continue to use this procuct.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Works great for thinning hair but not so much if you are going bald. It tends to cake on the scalp after a long sweaty workout. Overall I really like this product. Its much cheaper than the more expensive brands online and does just as good.</li>
    <li> Not my first order, it is wonderful.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Been spending to much until now.Re-fills is the way to go. At first I thought it was to light (as in weight). Noticed more in my hair than scalp that you get with the others. Call me Samson&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year now. It is a great replacement that works as well as those more expensive fibers. It definitely does the job and does it well. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This product is the best! The refill option is so convenient and cheaper than buying the canisters over and over. I love the sealable packaging! Keratin Research always ships this product faster than I expect!</li>
    <li> This is my second package, the first one was so good I ended up giving some away to my clients and needed more for myself!&lt;br /&gt;This product sells itself, it is truly that good.  I wont be without it again.  Competitively priced and an excellent product.</li>
    <li> Used this product for over a year and love it. This company has great prices and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Works just as well as Toppik without the itching.  Just put in your own container, I used my own Toppik container and it worked fine.  I think that it works equally as well as the Nanogen fibers too.  Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have used Toppik’s hair building fibers for a few years now and was pleased to learn that there was an alternative to their high prices.  Samson Hair Fibers is that alternative.  Their product is as good as Toppik (I can’t tell the difference) but at a MUCH more reasonable price.  I buy the refills and use my old Toppik dispenser for the application and it works great.  Keratin Research always provides quick and efficient delivery on or before the estimated delivery date so I plan on a long and happy business relationship with them.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. My hair has been thinning and I hate trying to cover it up by combing. This just shakes on and that&#x27;s it. It makes my hair look thicker. I was worried about it coming off on my clothing, but that doesn&#x27;t happen. You can brush it and it stay&#x27;s put until you shampoo it out. I&#x27;m very, very happy.</li>
    <li> i bought this to refill my toppik container.  the problem with it is that it isn&#x27;t like toppik at all.  it clogs up the air applicator.  if you use the little nozzle applicator, do not buy this product!  i had to buy a new applicator and just threw most of this stuff away.</li>
