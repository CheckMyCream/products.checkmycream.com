      <li>I love this mitt</li>
      <li>You must have this mitt to help spread the self tanner more evenly.  </li>

      <li>Geting tinted and also makes the aplication easier and more even.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used the St. Tropez mitt and it was way better, this mitt got all clumped up after washing it</li>

      <li>I love it makes everything easier</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m glad I ordered this with the tanning mousse.</li>
      <li>It makes it a much more quicker, cleaner, streak-free process</li>
      <li>Be sure to put lotion on your  knees and elbows before applying the mousse.</li>
      <li>and hopefully my opinion will change for the better.</li>
      <li>but you can darken it up by reapplying more .</li>
      <li>I am sure you can use it with all kinds of tan creams or mousses.</li>
      <li>gets the job done evenly while being comfortable!</li>
      <li>Which is to keep the tan from getting on most of your hands, and spreading it much more evenly.</li>
      <li>I will try it a couple more times, though, while I use up my tanning mousse</li>
      <li>LOVE IT.</li>
      <li>MORE TAN HANDS!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I think this product could have been executed much better.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m glad I got this.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve recommended it to many of my friends.</li>
      <li>it was more exfoliating than it should be, considering it&#x27;s for APPLYING your tanner.</li>

      <li>so your hand can fit in.  </li>
      <li>and I even got a free lipgloss included, which was an added bonus.</li>
      <li>The St. Moriz Tan Tanning Applicator Mitt is great once I received the proper one.</li>
      <li>The mitt worked well at first, but the more I used it, it didn&#x27;t smooth on my skin as easy.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was so lost on self tanning before buying this baby. It has helped improve self tanning experience SO MUCH. It helps to apply the tanning lotion/mousse/spray so much more efficiently. It makes it a much more quicker, cleaner, streak-free process and I love it. Keeps my hands clean and leaves me streak free in no time! I recommend this to everyoneeee!</li>
    <li> gets the job done evenly while being comfortable! its very affordable but i have had mine for awhile and it is still in good condition!</li>
    <li> I used the mitt with the St Moriz Instant Self Tanning Mousse and I couldn&#x27;t love it more! I&#x27;ve recommended it to many of my friends. No smell or lines after applying. If you already have a tan I would recommend getting the dark color instead of the medium. I say its a must have!! Love love love!</li>
    <li> This mitt is great--it spreads the tanner well without turning your hands brown.  With the right tanner you&#x27;ll end up with a great glow.  It&#x27;s also washable so I&#x27;ll give it a light washing with baby shampoo after I&#x27;m done, let it hang dry, and it&#x27;s good to go again the next day.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this so badly. the first time i bought this the mitt started to rip and was unusable so the seller sent me another one. which was awesome, now the second mitt has ripped within a couple of weeks :( such a bummer.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the self tanning foam but the mitt is horrible. It helpef in applying the foam, however it kept slipping off my hand during application. Afterwards I rinsed it in warm water to clean it &amp; it shriveled up kind of like melted together and I can not use it anymore. So I got one use out of it. :(</li>
    <li> Still a little streaky</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had different self-tanning mitts, and this one seems to be holding up really well.  Offered at a good price, too!</li>
    <li> The mitts last a while and give u a perfect tan when using a mouse!</li>
    <li> This mitt does not compare to the ones that I have received with self-tanning product.  It is stiff and thin and product does not go on easily with this mitt.</li>
    <li> In my opinion this mitt makes it hard to really rub in the tanner. It&#x27;s really thin, not that soft and made of bad quality. I won&#x27;t be using it again...</li>
    <li> For a basic, inexpensive tanning mitt you can&#x27;t go past this. It does the job perfectly and gives great results</li>
    <li> I got it in great time. I love it makes everything easier</li>
    <li> The instructions say to wash it after use.  However, if you do, it shrinks and becomes matted together, so it&#x27;s not usable again.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This works perfectly to apply self tanners. It goes on smooth for an even look, and the best part is...your hands stay clean</li>
    <li> Worked wonders exfoliating the dead skin off my body. I&#x27;ve only used it a couple times so far but I really like it.</li>
    <li> It said to wash with warm water after every use. It sould warn you not to use too warm of water or it will get stuck wrinkled. had to throw it away.</li>
    <li> I ordered this mitt several weeks ago. It finally arrived. The one I got does not look as pictured. It is plain, without any writing on it. I think it is a generic brand that I received. I only used the St. Tropez  mitt and had it for the whole summer season. This mitt is super thin and does not apply tanner smoothly. It went in the garbage.</li>
    <li> So many beauty bloggers raved about this mitt and it worked like a charm. Feels a tad like the mitt might fall apart while rubbing in your self tanner, but it did a good job of making sure my hands don&#x27;t turn orange or brown! Honestly, for the price, if you can&#x27;t find one cheaper, at least you can be guaranteed that this one will do it&#x27;s job.</li>
    <li> If you are purchasing the st moriz self tanner make you sure you also buy this mitt!! It makes application so easy and smooth and so much faster than any other technique I&#x27;ve used. Makes blending so much easier.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t wash it with hot water it will melt. Use luke warm and be very gentle! Good thing I bought several! But I can&#x27;t imagine putting on the tan mousse without it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely my FAVORITE tanning mitt by far! It is soo smooth and soft on my skin and it distributes the tanning mousse so evenly and it also has a protective layer between the front of the mitt and your hand there for keeping any extra soaking through to your hands! Now I use the st moriz tanning mousse as well with this mitt.  But I have used other tanning mists and mousses with it also. It still works just perfectly! Absolutely love it and most definitely recommend this to anyone!!</li>
    <li> this is a great tool to use to apply your tan as it stops streaks beautifully!  Would definitely recommend and repurchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I ordered this with the tanning mousse. The mousse is very dark and stains. Be sure to put lotion on your  knees and elbows before applying the mousse. Also, wash the mitt after each use and don&#x27;t wring it out to remove excess water-I destroyed mine doing that.  It wouldn&#x27;t uncrinkle and I had to get a new one. Lastly, get a mini mitt for your face!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it multiple times with no problem really good mitt!</li>
    <li> I have used this several times and it is still holding up well. Does a good job of putting on sunless tanner even. I wash it after every use.</li>
    <li> This glove works great. It is easy to use and lotion is applied evenly. Must wash between uses and let dry completely or the lotion could go on splotchy and uneven.</li>
    <li> the mitt worked out great, it made my tan so much more streak free and so much more easy to apply.</li>
    <li> This fell apart in the washing machine on the first wash. If you use self tanner then you know you HAVE to wash the application mitt. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what I hoped it would. Helps use my tanning lotions and buff it out for a more natural look.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a new mitt to apply any self tanners then pick this. I&#x27;ve used it with three different brands and achieved perfect results each time.  I love that it&#x27;s lined so you don&#x27;t need latex gloves,  very convenient.</li>
    <li> The glove doesn&#x27;t stay on your hand and doesn&#x27;t protect your hand either so my hands turned an awful color and it took days to scrub it off</li>
    <li> Awesome tanning mitt. Works really well with all self tanners. Helps you achieve an even tan every time. Easy to slip on and off without making a mess.</li>
    <li> This brand is a great alternative to st tropez cheaper and because it comes from europe you know it is quality</li>
    <li> These are the best to have to apply the tanning lotion and then you have no streaking and you can guide it more places&lt;br /&gt;I just love these and order them always now when ordering the spray tan which is a must in my book now .</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion is the BEST I&#x27;ve ever tried ! Nice tanned look ! Very natural but you can darken it up by reapplying more . The best thing is after you shower the next day it doesn&#x27;t rub off on the towel at all .. Awesome !!!!!!!</li>
    <li> It come off on my pants when I cross my legs!</li>
    <li> It was wonderful! No streaks. I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> totally same i really liked it it didn&#x27;t stain my hands. and the seller is amazing really recommend !</li>
    <li> This one lasts me months longer than other tanning mitts. No rips or excessive staining. And the material is thicker, not flimsy.</li>
    <li> This self tan tanning applicator mitt is awesome. I recently applied a self tanner using this mitt and it went on perfectly, no blotchiness or streaks.</li>
    <li> Shipped fast. kinda slips off your hand if you&#x27;re not careful but a great product and a fair price. I bought it with the self tanner and would definitely recommend both</li>
    <li> Very cheaply made, doesn&#x27;t cover the entire palm and wrist area AND the tanner soaks through the mitt if it is a little saturated. Poor product and definitely not worth the money. Would never repurchase.</li>
    <li> I havn&#x27;t had any problems with this mitt! I was hesitant to buy it when I saw so many bad reviews on it, however it works great for me. For the price even if it does break down eventually its okay!</li>
    <li> This glove gets a 5 star rating from my daughter. She says its the best glove at the best price out there.</li>
    <li> This is the best Mitch I have used!</li>
    <li> I could not find a tan mitt in any shop in ak. I just had to go online. Got amazing cheep quick service and I even got a free lipgloss included, which was an added bonus. Great company</li>
    <li> This mitt does not work. Disposable gloves work better at applying lotion.very very very very very very very very disapointed....</li>
    <li> I like not having to worry about orange palms with this. I have small hands so it&#x27;s kinda annoying to keep it on but after a few times using it I hardly notice it anymore.</li>
    <li> if you&#x27;re not careful then the tanning lotions seeps through the sponge onto your fingers</li>
    <li> this is a must have for tanning application if you want it to be evenly distributed! LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> Fell apart after a couple uses.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I got this. For some reason my tanning foam kept balling up every time I used a pair of gloves, so I finally bought this mitt. It&#x27;s fairly reasonable in price. I just wish I&#x27;d purchased it sooner. Works great.</li>
    <li> I really like this Mitt.  Usually I use gloves and the application comes out of streaky, but with the mitt the application is much easier and goes on more evenly.  My hands stay clean and I like the results.</li>
    <li> You must have this mitt to help spread the self tanner more evenly.  It&#x27;s great.  Don&#x27;t wash it in hot water though.  The inside material will stick to itself and then it&#x27;s a little spooky tearing it apart so your hand can fit in.  It came apart fine though.  I just rinse it in cold water now.</li>
    <li> I have been self tanning for past two decades but this is first time using this kind of  a mitt. The concept is nice where it smooths out the tanner ( non latex or latex gloves if not allergic work great for this) but this product ate up all my self tanning product. It was like wipe on product to skin then wipe off product with this mitt. The mitt got thicker each time I tried to spread the self tanner product on skin and I could see and feel it accumulate onto the mitt.  The thin non sponge side( almost like satin polyester) let the tanner bleed right through onto my hands so I had to wash my hands after or they would have been stained.  The best part is when I hand washed the mitt after use  to clean it and it took two days to  air dry and shriveled up.  My tips are to use latex type doctor gloves could probably get a whole box for this price . I have also used those super cheap craft store sponge paint brushes to smooth out self tanner but this product is a waste and dissappointment.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the mouse..... AT ALL.... until I got this item to put it on with. MaKes it look, go on, and seem so much easier! NO MORE TAN HANDS!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this to go with the tannin mousse!</li>
    <li> This is an okay mitt. I&#x27;ve tried one other one before that came with a spray tan that I purchased and I figured maybe this was the same. It&#x27;s not. This one is much more abrasive. The edges tend to scratch your skin while your applying your tan. Also doesn&#x27;t really stay on your hand. And the tan will get through the mitt on the other side and tan your hands sometimes. Other than those things, it does mostly what it is intended to do. Which is to keep the tan from getting on most of your hands, and spreading it much more evenly. I don&#x27;t see how anyone could apply tan without a mitt so this will do.</li>
    <li> If you apply self tanner you need this mitt.  This is not the best mitt I&#x27;ve ever used, but it does the job.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to use with my St Morize Instant Self Tanning Mousse, and I want to say up front that I have only used it once so far as I am unsure how much I like the mousse.&lt;br /&gt;This mit, however, definitely applies the product but I have a few gripes about it - first, the applicator side of the mit is rather absorbant. So I feel like I had to use much more product that is really necessary for a tan just so I could get it to apply to my skin without it all being sucked into the mit. Secondly, to piggy back on that, the inside of the mit itself is not waterproof so the tanning mousse will absorb right through the mit and into the skin on your fingers. How annoying. I think this product could have been executed much better. I will try it a couple more times, though, while I use up my tanning mousse and hopefully my opinion will change for the better.</li>
    <li> The mitt worked well at first, but the more I used it, it didn&#x27;t smooth on my skin as easy. Also, I have small hands and it was too big. I had to keep my fingers spread open inside the mitt to keep it from coming off my hand.</li>
    <li> The mitt works well w/distributing the color, but is too thin.  So the orange color gets all over your hands &amp; is difficult to get off :(.  If it were a thicker material I think it would work better.  The second time I used it, I had to wear glove underneath.  Defeated the purpose I think.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the St. Tropez mitt and it was way better, this mitt got all clumped up after washing it and if you tried to flatten it out it would start ripping.  Got to use once.</li>
    <li> The mitt is wonderful for keeping the St. Moriz even... a must have if you want a nice, even tan.</li>
    <li> The St. Moriz Tan Tanning Applicator Mitt is great once I received the proper one. The first mitt I received ended up being defective. The mitt stained my fingers and hands and then the mitt fused together once I rinsed it. My friends had never had this problem with theirs so I reached out to St. Moriz. They sent me a new mitt that I received in just a few weeks. This mitt was clearly made differently based on the inside liner. The mitt did not stain my hands or fingers this time and I was able to rinse it without it fusing together. Great applicator for the St. Moriz Instant Self Tanning Mousse!</li>
    <li> This mitt keeps your hands clean, but washes to look like its brand new after each wash. Should have bought 2 just in case:)</li>
    <li> It worked horribly.  Anytime I tried to use it pieces of fuzzy stuff would come off and leave speckles. I hated it</li>
    <li> Bought to help make my &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; more even, but this item falls apart easily. For a even tone I would suggest buying a large soft brush</li>
    <li> I feel like this mitt makes it hard to really rub in the tanner. It&#x27;s really thin &amp; not that soft. I&#x27;ve used the Fake &amp; Bake mitt &amp; I like that one a lot better. It gets the job done, but It&#x27;s not great.</li>
    <li> it came faster in the mail then it said was going to be here&lt;br /&gt;it works great for blending or bluffing for any self tanner I love this mitt&lt;br /&gt;works great with out washing with washing comes off but keep in mind hand try it don&#x27;t add it&lt;br /&gt;in the dryer it shrinks it and get&#x27;s ruin but over all a very good mitt and everyone should get it to&lt;br /&gt;even out your self tan look :)</li>
    <li> I bought it to be used with the St. Moriz tan and they work perfectly together. I am sure you can use it with all kinds of tan creams or mousses. It prevents your hands fro. Geting tinted and also makes the aplication easier and more even.</li>
    <li> this totally buffed off any fake tan i already had on!! it was more exfoliating than it should be, considering it&#x27;s for APPLYING your tanner. i won&#x27;t be using it again.</li>
    <li> This mitt works very great if you&#x27;re also using the St. Moriz Mousse self tanner. It really help even it with no streaks, the only downside is that, it&#x27;s kind of hard to wash the mitt back to brand new, so you might want to stock on them</li>
