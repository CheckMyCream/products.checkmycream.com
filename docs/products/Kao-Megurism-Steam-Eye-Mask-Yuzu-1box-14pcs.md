    <li> I love it! It help me sleep well.</li>
    <li> I use it every day now. Both the nap at noon or sleep in the evening. Because of the  warm stem it is  very likely to feel relaxing~</li>
    <li> like the lavender ones that smell awesome better- these had no smell but they are so great to use if your traveling , plane, car, train love them</li>
    <li> Ocassionally, I get dry eyes during the night, so in the morning one or both of my eyes are stinging.  To remedy the sting, I place a warm face towel over my eyes.  The downside to this is the face towel get cold in about 2 minutes.  So instead of 15 minute to remedy the pain, it was taking me 30 minutes.  One day a friend of mine gave me two packet of this eye mask. I was so happy when I discover that this amazing eye mask becomes warm as soon as you take if off the packet and stay warm for about 20 minutes.  No more wet towel over my eyes.  What a great product.</li>
    <li> Love the smell so much! Help me falling sleep, and can be reused as normal mask for one or two time, good choice!</li>
