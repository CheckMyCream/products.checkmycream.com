      <li>I loved it and it worked great</li>
      <li>didnt stop perspiration, nice smell!</li>
      <li>I have recommended it to many of my friends who are also impressed</li>
      <li>This smells very nice and works well for a good 24 hours; after that, you&#x27;re going to smell funky.</li>
      <li>so I could reapply at work, but at the end of the day I was still not smelling pleasant.  </li>
      <li>You have to scoop some out and put it on your fingers to rub it in, but it&#x27;s pleasant.</li>
      <li>but this is so easy and smells great!</li>
      <li>The smell is great, I had no idea what bergamot smelled like, but I&#x27;m glad I made the gamble!</li>
      <li>This stuff smells awesome, and is smooth.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works great , gave me a rash though but, everything does.</li>
    <li> Excellent! I wish amazon carried the lavender+sage instead of making me order on a external site, but this does the job, as long as your skin isn&#x27;t irritated by baking soda. No hidden aluminums or paraben.</li>
    <li> This product works every bit as good as dry solids, only without all the harsh and dangerous chemicals!! I love it and will continue to use it!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a natural deodorant that doesn&#x27;t make me smell like I&#x27;ve been wondering in the forest for days. The Bergamot (a type of orange if you didn&#x27;t know) and lime smell amazing! I bit strong when you first put it on but it dies down. It melts into your skin and you can sort of feel the small grains of baking soda (which is not visible.) I just want those new to natural deodorant to know that you&#x27;re not going to find one that you put on in the morning and you can still smell two days later. This deodorant needs application in the morning and then maybe mid-day if its hot, on a cold day it last me with one application. If you&#x27;re going for a run, put it on right before you&#x27;ll be fine. Just a warning you can&#x27;t apply this once in the morning go to work all day, then the gym and then out dancing, stick with the harsh chemicals if you don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll have time to reapply. On a typical day of work, school and yoga I stay fresh with two applications.</li>
    <li> Hands down best deodorant I have ever used, I will be purchasing more!!!</li>
    <li> I originally got a sample of this in a beauty box and fell immediately in love with the scent (smells like lime pie) that I ran to Amazon and ordered two deodorants. What a mistake that was! After just a week of using this product once a day, my armpits turned black and cracked open. My skin peeled off in chunks, and I suffered intense pain. I still have discoloration from this deodorant even though I have stopped using this several weeks ago.</li>
    <li> Love this! Only natural product that has actually worked for me!!</li>
    <li> Loved it, smelled great and it worked until it started burning my armpits off! I had alligator skin for a few days after discontinuing the product.</li>
    <li> Goes on nice and easy but as someone who sweats a lot especially during the summer I have to use more than the directions say to use. However, I love the smell and will buy again and again!</li>
    <li> Just as described shipped very well and safely too.I love the very fresh and bright scent this deodorant has.</li>
    <li> Among the best products I have ever seen so far.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this deodorant, but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work for me. The smell was fantastic but it burned my underarms. Also, if I didn&#x27;t reapply later in the day I would end up smelling pretty stinky. I&#x27;ve used other natural deodorant products that gave me better results.</li>
    <li> I bought two different scents of this natural deodorant and love both of them!  Easy to apply, no waiting time to dry, smells good and is effective.</li>
    <li> For years I have had to use Clinical Strength deodorants that contain the highest amount of Aluminum to prevent sweating and odor and feel comfortably clean all day.  Not anymore!  This all natural deodorant is amazing and IT WORKS.  It&#x27;s extremely effective at preventing sweating and keeping me odor free all day - in fact, it is just as effective as the best Clinical Strength deodorants with aluminum but it&#x27;s all natural.  Can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> Schmidt&#x27;s deodorants work much better than the other natural alternatives I have tried.  I feel drier and fresher.</li>
    <li> This all natural deodorant WORKS!  I&#x27;ve tried several different kinds, some work at first, and then stop working, others just never work.  This is the 2nd time I&#x27;ve ordered this product and I&#x27;ve been using it even during BIKRAM YOGA and it works!  I  don&#x27;t even stink after 90 minutes of crazy sweating :)</li>
    <li> Love this product. I have problems with almost all deodorants, rash and itching. I have had  no problems and the scent is soft and pleasant.</li>
    <li> In LOVE! I tried 12 other natural deodorants before this one.  Figured my body must need the icky parabens (Arm &amp; Hammer natural worked no aluminum but parabens included). Avoided Schmidt&#x27;s because it came in a jar.  Wish I had tried sooner.  Worked for me immediately on day one.  So glad I did not give up my year long search for a natural alternative &amp; very grateful to all those who stuck by me :)</li>
    <li> I like this product. It&#x27;s not perfect, but it&#x27;s good. I had been getting irritation under my arms for a while and wanted to try something more natural to see if that helped. It did! I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over a month. I love the smell of this - it kinda reminded me of sniffing a box of Fruity Pebbles. The smell fades quickly though, and unlike with other deodorants, it doesn&#x27;t reappear when you sweat. I don&#x27;t smell anything after it fades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as odor control, I have yet to notice a problem. I live in Texas (hello, heat and humidity) and I&#x27;m a runner, so to keep from stinking is saying something. I tried Tom&#x27;s brand (several varieties) and they did not help the stink, but this one does. However, it does not keep me dry. I definitely feel wet, and not just in high heat or stress situations. So far I have yet to notice any stains on my clothes from it, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The application can take a bit of getting used to, but then it just becomes part of your regular routine. The consistency in the jar is like, well, deodorant. I feel like maybe it could be put in a stick format to be applied that way, but I&#x27;m no scientist. So you scoop a little out onto your index finger with the spatula provided. It says &amp;#34;Do not overapply.&amp;#34; but I&#x27;m not sure what over-applying is - how much is too much? I&#x27;m still learning I guess. You warm it in between your thumb and index finger, and then rub it on your underarms. I do one scoop per side. It melts very quickly and easily into a spreadable consistency. After applying, you have to wash your hands though because it still remains on your fingers. I apply it before and after dressing, and have not noticed any white marks on my clothing (even black!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend applying right after shaving - it stung me when I did that! However, I have not noticed any irritation from the product. In fact, it made my underarms look much more appealing, if that&#x27;s possible. No more redness, bumps or dark spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;- Smells great&lt;br /&gt;- Keeps the stink away&lt;br /&gt;- No skin irritation&lt;br /&gt;- Does not rub off on clothing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- A little pricey&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t keep you dry&lt;br /&gt;- Gets on your hands&lt;br /&gt;- Stings after shaving&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I think it&#x27;s better than what I had been using, so I&#x27;ll repurchase. I&#x27;ve already recommended to a couple of friends. I look forward to trying the other scents!- Smells great - Keeps the stink away - No skin irritation - Does not rub off on clothing  Cons: - A little pricey - Doesn&#x27;t keep you dry - Gets on your hands - Stings after shaving  All in all I think it&#x27;s better than what I had been using, so I&#x27;ll repurchase. I&#x27;ve already recommended to a couple of friends. I look forward to trying the other scents!</li>
    <li> I purchased this directly from Schmidt&#x27;s on their Etsy store.  While I love the scent, it doesn&#x27;t last and I feel like I smelled like BO by lunch.  I have a desk job so it&#x27;s not like I was running for 4 hours.  Further I found the application to be very messy.  There&#x27;s got to be a better way then using my fingers to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product also caused an awful rash on my underarms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The search for a natural deodorant continues!</li>
    <li> Sorry for the bad review but this didn&#x27;t work for me.  My underarms smelled like funky Pine sol. No thank you guess my search continues😔😔.</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly, and works extremely well.  Definitely an all purpose, heavy duty deodorant</li>
    <li> This makes my underarms sore. It smells nice. Since it&#x27;s only a deodorant, I won&#x27;t buy again. I live in humid and hot climates and need an antiperspirant. Price is rather steep, too.</li>
    <li> I love this product because you can work all day with applying one application however,when I shaved the night before and applied it the next morning it irritated my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying different types and brands of natural deodorant for years. This is the one I&#x27;m finally settling on. No frustrating ingredients, no skin irritation and no stink. It holds up through my usual smelly workouts and the scent is light and pleasant. A stick would be more convenient but it works well enough that I don&#x27;t care too much.</li>
    <li> The deodorant worked great to control odor, but I started to develop a rash and discoloration on my armpits. Found out that it is my skin reacting to the baking soda. Be careful if you have sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> I sweat. A lot. I&#x27;ve used antiperspirants my whole life and even when using the prescription strength ones, I have never found anything that worked consistently. I am not usually a huge natural product person for my toiletries, but after reading a lot of articles about how antiperspirant can actually make you sweat more, I thought I would try training my body on deodorant. I had put some Dove on this morning and went for a walk, then applied this product when it arrived. It smells great. Really fresh and natural; I hate baby powder and traditional &amp;#34;soapy&amp;#34; smells, so the citrus is great. I&#x27;ve been doing errands and still smell good, with just a little sweat. I am going to continue using this product over the next few days to see if it will work for me in the long term. I think this is a winner, but I will update my review if not.</li>
    <li> This particular smell is heavenly! Like fresh squeezed lime with a touch of sweetness. I&#x27;ve been using all natural deodorants for awhile now so I don&#x27;t mind rubbing it on with my hands, Im usually fresh out the shower so it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m dirty. I think this is one of the best Ive tried out of many, it keeps me smelling fresh all day (mind you, you still sweat as its not an antiperspirant, but sweating is healthy and oak with me!). Two small cons are; one, it can be a little crumbly and therefore tricky to get the right amount out, but it is winter so maybe when it warms up it will be more pliable. Two, it has baking soda and arrowroot in it, which can be very irritating. I did get a rash at first, but its mild and seems to be fading. However, I have found the other natural products that don&#x27;t have baking soda or arrowroot do not work as long, so its worth the initial rash in my opinion. Overall, fantastic quality product!</li>
    <li> works great when every other deodorant fall short.  almost finished the jar and will definitely be buying it again.</li>
    <li> smelled more lime than bergamot.  like lime jello. kept me dry</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product. After finding out that my trusted natural deodorant was reformulated and not so natural anymore, I have been on the hunt for a replacement. This smells awesome and works pretty well for the most part. It failed me the other day when I was super sweaty. And, like other users noted, I also got a rash and I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin. I also am not a fan of having to rub it on with my fingers. I&#x27;m sure they could have figured out how to make this in a standard bottle. Wish I could give it more stars but it hasn&#x27;t worked as well as I wanted it to.</li>
    <li> So this is not only a nigh-perfect deodorant, it keeps my armpits pretty dry, too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been on what seems like a never-ending quest for an aluminum-free deodorant that actually works. I&#x27;ve tried Jason&#x27;s tea tree oil deodorant stick, Tom&#x27;s calendula-scented stick, Crystal&#x27;s lavender roll-on, and now Schmidt&#x27;s bergamot lime \\&quot;paste.\\&quot; The bergamot lime smells the best of any deodorant I&#x27;ve tried so far. It&#x27;s fresh smelling and not too strong, and it doesn&#x27;t overpower any perfume I might be wearing. This deodorant also lasts longer than the others I&#x27;ve tried. I can usually go the whole day without offending myself. The issue with this stuff is that it still doesn&#x27;t last as long at preventing odor as mainstream brand Secret (I don&#x27;t care about anti-perspirant, I&#x27;m just talking pure stink-control), and it&#x27;s a huge pain to apply. The stick they provide to retrieve the deodorant scrapes along the surface, creating a semi-cohesive pea-sized chunk of paste to apply. When you rub it between your hands to get a uniform layer, it often balls up and slips through your fingers. Once you&#x27;ve actually applied it to your underarms you definitely have to wash your hands, because it leaves a lime-scented residue that I wouldn&#x27;t want to apply to anything else I&#x27;d touched. I&#x27;ve stopped using this deodorant because it&#x27;s so annoying to apply.</li>
    <li> This smells amazing but unfortunately did not work for me, after 3 months of experimenting. I still have it and am wondering if I can whip in some oil or butters to upcycle it into a lotion or body cream.</li>
    <li> Pluses: it&#x27;s all-natural, it&#x27;s cruelty-free, it smells great, and it actually works!!! It genuinely deodorizes, which is a relief because other natural deodorants just don&#x27;t work for me. Note: it&#x27;s not an antiperspirant, so you may still sweat. I&#x27;m not a big sweater so idc. One minus: it&#x27;s given me a bit of a rash, and that&#x27;s most likely because of baking soda. It hurt for two days, then the pain stopped but the bumps themselves remained. Soooooo who knows? I really like this deodorant and I&#x27;m going to keep using it as long as the mysterious rash never comes back :P Update: the rash came back... And now it won&#x27;t go away. Oddly it only affects my left side and not the right at all. But either way, I have to say the rash has only worsened, and I&#x27;ve never considered myself someone with super sensitive skin. I don&#x27;t dislike this product, but I can&#x27;t keep using it now.</li>
    <li> Smells great, goes on smooth, but it gave me an itchy rash.  Back to Dove sensitive...</li>
    <li> I am absolutely sold after one try!!!  I have used Secret, Degree, Suave, Dove and all the clinical!  They are extremely expensive and extremely worthless!  I would put these deodorants on and not even an hour and I have to be worrying if I smell or if I&#x27;m sweating or both!!!  Sooo embarrassing, especially when I have to run around with my special needs children at school!  I had to be apply almost every hour!....  I put this on this morning before going on a field trip with my students...  We worry about transportation, about them getting lost, about them getting hurt and making sure they have fun by running around and keeping them entertained....  Today here in Arizona it was a hot day....  I put it on and ran around all day,  got wet with the bumper boats ran around with them with laser tag then went to the park to eat lunch and play some basketball and soccer....  I got home and dressed down and usually I had to put more deodorant....  Not this time!  It&#x27;s absolutely amazing!  I am sooo happy!!!  Thank you!  Thank you!  Thank you!  You don&#x27;t know what freedom this has brought to my life!!!  I will continue to purchase this deodorant!  I will make sure many hear of this!  Once again!  Thank you for helping me feel sure to raise my hands in the air and wave them like I just don&#x27;t care!</li>
    <li> could not tell you how this works, because it half empty. Where you wonder was the other half? Soaked into the shipping box and all the other items in my order. I guess you should not order this deodorant in the summer. This and all my other items are useless! Very frustrating.</li>
    <li> I have a pretty active job where I&#x27;m on my feet a lot. This deodorant keeps me smelling fresh throughout the day. I love the bergamot &amp; lime scent!</li>
    <li> didnt stop perspiration, nice smell!</li>
    <li> I have never had such a bad reaction to a topical product ever.  This deodorant burned my arm pits and I ended up needing to go to the doctor to get a prescription cream to help clear it up.  For 3 days i could barely lift my arms up, they are a combo of black and blue with burnt patches of skin under my arms and the burning did not stop for days after use.  I highly recommend if you do purchase this product that you test a patch of your skin before applying.</li>
    <li> Need better way to apply product as it is messy and inconvenient</li>
    <li> I have a theory that regular deodorant makes you more stinky.  Sure you put it on and smell good, but after continued use you stink worse than ever before.  Then you use their product more because you are so rank.  I quit using regular deodorant a couple years ago and am much less offensive.  I have tried all kinds of natural and what finally worked was just plain baking soda.  I&#x27;ve read some reviews that this deodorant can cause breakouts and cyst like  bumps under your arms.  It is the baking soda in it.  I have had that happen using plain baking soda.  I think it can clog pores.  With that said I have found that if you follow these steps it will help minimize that from happening and is still the best way to go.  I really like the added essential oils and creaminess of this product and find that it works even better than baking soda alone.  Plus a little goes a long way.  So here is how I recommend using this.  1. use a small amount  2. warm it in your fingers  3. PAT it on your skin, don&#x27;t rub it, that will make it more likely to clog your  pores.  4.  Don&#x27;t use directly after shaving. or right before a workout (because the friction can cause irritation).  5. give it a break every now and then, when you are not going somewhere for the day, don&#x27;t wear it.  So far this is the best natural product I have found.  Otherwise I would go back to using straight essential oil or baking soda.  Trust me, it&#x27;s the old deodorant that is &amp;#34;reeking&amp;#34; havoc in your pits.  Get off of it!!</li>
    <li> Great natural deodorant.  The Bergamot-Lime burns after shaving though, if you have sensitive skin, I would go with the Lavender/sage.</li>
    <li> Best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve tried by far. Works better than traditional deodorant.</li>
    <li> Goes on strong all day! Amazing stuff.</li>
    <li> Schmidt&#x27;s Deodorant works so well i will never turn back.Im going to try and make my own because for what it is its way over priced.</li>
    <li> Love this scent and it works just as well as the cedarwood and juniper scent.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! Only downside is that is a bit messy when applying, but it works great!</li>
    <li> ANAZING!!!!!!  Read the reviews had high hopes and I&#x27;m excited to report it works.  I&#x27;m 50 years old and have hot flashes. IT WORKS!!!</li>
    <li> Initially, I would have given this product 5 stars.  The smell is a little strong, but wears off quickly.  What I really loved about the product was that it kept me odor free all day and into the next morning.  That rarely happens for me, even with regular deodorant. It even held up through my Pilates class and power walk.  However, by day three I had a large bump under my armpit that was so large I initially thought it was a cyst.  I&#x27;m guessing the deodorant clogged the pore and caused a cystic-like acne breakout.  Once I stopped using it, it went away but I stopped using the product as a result.</li>
    <li> Great smell. Keeps the stink away. But like some of the other reviewers, I had to stop using it after a couple of weeks. It really irritates my skin.</li>
    <li> Seems to work fine but is very inconvenient and messy to apply so I end up never using it.  Hopefully the company will figure out how make this &#x27;user friendly&#x27;.</li>
    <li> This smells divine!  It works! It keeps me dry and smelling great throughout the day.  I love the spatula that&#x27;s included with this.  It&#x27;s a great way to maintain purity.  I also love the glass jar packaging.  This is a class A product.</li>
    <li> It smells great but I break out every time I use it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  The smell is amazing but it doesn&#x27;t last forever which is good because I don&#x27;t always want to smell like something, but I haven&#x27;t had any issues with odor at all.  I used crystal essence roll on in the past and this is WAY better.  It&#x27;s not sticky and is easy to reapply and is very effective.  I have very sensitive arm pits and the shea butter in this makes my underarm skin feel fantastic and I have no issues with applying this after shaving.  Before the Crystal Essence I used Tom&#x27;s (various scents) and it always made my underarms peel!  Schmidt&#x27;s is fantastic!!  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever try anything else again!</li>
    <li> My friend told me I should buy this deodorant because I wasn&#x27;t happy with the other natural brands I had tried.  I love it!  I&#x27;ve been using Schmidt&#x27;s for 2 months now.  I only have to apply it once and it lasts me the entire day.  I got my husband hooked on it too, and he now wants to try the Cedarwood one.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Works well.  I&#x27;d give it 5 stars but I break out on one arm!</li>
    <li> I have used a few natural brands of deodorant (most recently Tom&#x27;s of Maine) and decided to try this since I was not very happy with my Tom&#x27;s. To be fair, I am a really really sweaty person (without even working out) so I am very hard on deodorants. I like the smell of this deodorant and it does work slightly better then the Tom&#x27;s, but frankly I still stink halfway through the day and it does little to control my under arm wetness. I would say it is slightly superior to other natural deodorants I have tried, however the high price and small jar just don&#x27;t make it worth it for me. After only a week I have used about a quarter of the jar so I don&#x27;t anticipate this jar lasting any longer then 3 and a half weeks so for me it&#x27;s just to expensive to pay this much for a product that work just slightly better then the other natural products but at A LOT higher of a price.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells amazing and actually works - my only qualm is that it&#x27;s on the dry side which led to crumbling when using the spatula it comes with. I switched to just using my finger to get it out and it&#x27;s much better.</li>
    <li> I liked this deodorant, at first.  Tried to for a week. It didn&#x27;t work very well, and than my under arms started to peel.  I stopped using the product.</li>
    <li> this is the first &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorant that has gained a 5 star rating from me.  It&#x27;s easy to put on, works all day and has a great scent.  I will definitely be purchasing this again in the future.</li>
    <li> Second time I have purchased this product and by far the best natural deodorant I have used.  I would highly recommend the product.</li>
    <li> This deodorant is honestly better then any deodorant I have tried in the past. I never had an ounce of must or body odor after working all day then hitting the gym. The only issue was that it literally peeled my armpit skin off to the point that it looked like I had 3rd degree burns after only a week of use. I wish I could use it because it&#x27;s amazing but my armpit skin has a vendetta against me and won&#x27;t allow it. I am not a person who suffers from sensitive skin as I have had acid peels do less damage then this</li>
    <li> I was very hesitant to switch to a natural deodorant after being an antiperspirant users for so many years.  I started with Arm &amp; Hammer deodorant but realized it still had triclosan.  I then moved over to Primal Pit Paste in stick form, then to jar.  I decided to try Schmidt&#x27;s because I love the smell of bergamot and lime and it&#x27;s actually a few bucks cheaper than Primal.  A few things I learned about going the natural route -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Wetness is not really any worse using this than with antiperspirant (the arrowroot helps with moisture)&lt;br /&gt;2) Itching and slight irritation is normal because of the baking soda, and it goes away after a couple of weeks&lt;br /&gt;3) It works much better if you trim or shave your arm pits&lt;br /&gt;4) Even after a day my pits don&#x27;t smell horrible like when I used antiperspirant</li>
    <li> Too dry.  Difficult to use</li>
    <li> I tried Schmidt&#x27;s Natural Deodorant after doing a ton of research on natural deodorants. At first I liked it even though the whole application process was a little irritating and my stink wasn&#x27;t totally taken care of. Unfortunately, after about 3 weeks of everyday use, the skin under my arms was totally irritated and I had to stop using it. Based on more research, I think it is the baking soda that my skin can&#x27;t tolerate. So sad that it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> This is a very, very good deodorant~~!!!</li>
    <li> Did well on concealing any odor but seemed to clog the pores of my armpits. The first week I used it, my armpit broke out with two pimple like irritations. I stopped using it for a few days till it went away and when I currently started using it again, I now got three more pimples. My armpits could just be very sensitive but I want to return it.</li>
    <li> This is the best deodorant! I love this smell and it really works. I work outside and while I still sweat I&#x27;m not smelly and that is wonderful. Works way better than conventional deodarant</li>
    <li> Smells nice.  Have not used in hot weather, so I don&#x27;t know how it will fare.  I like the smell and it does a good job.  I may review again in summer.  Downside is that you have to put on with your hands, but it&#x27;s not a huge problem.</li>
    <li> The first deodorant I&#x27;ve ever found to totally suppress underarm odor! I&#x27;ve been using Dove Ultimate cucumber &amp; green tea scent deordorant. It does not keep odor under control and it leaves white residue on shirts that I pull over my head. Schmidt&#x27;s Bergamot &amp; Lime does not have the residue problem. It smells great when applied. I love bergamot! The fragrance soon dissipates but the odor control remains. I&#x27;m really excited about it. Now I need to figure out what to do with all the extra Dove deordorant in my cupboard.</li>
    <li> I love this!  It has a really nice scent, goes on easily, and doesn&#x27;t even hurt after shaving.  I notice that I do sweat (as this is a deodorant, not antiperspirant), but it keeps bad odor away.</li>
    <li> Its quite greasy, being made of shea butter. Leaves a residue on clothes and is hard to apply.</li>
    <li> Love this deodorant.  However, it was a bad idea to order in hot weather.  It arrived as a liquid :(  It did harden up but the consistency wasn&#x27;t the same.  I will order a year&#x27;s supply when cooler weather comes.</li>
    <li> Works great.Really like it.</li>
    <li> Great deodrant and wonderful anti perspirant. No stains on clothing. Little pricey but well worth it. Try it you will love it.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells awesome, and is smooth. I haven&#x27;t had any sensitivity issues, but I also don&#x27;t use it every single day. I alternate between this stuff and the green tiding with lavender, because some days with work and school, depending on my schedule...it can sometimes be inconvenient applying this stuff by hand. You can&#x27;t just wipe it on you pants and be on your way, or else I wouldn&#x27;t care at all! I would definitely continue buying this product.</li>
    <li> I totally was surprised but I remain odor free all day.  The only thing the lime scent (which I absolutely love) disappears eventually.  I use the spoon provided with the product and put it on my hands for easy application.  Wish it were more like a thick liquid than the paste.</li>
    <li> I am amazed at how well this product works at eliminating the unwanted scent of body odor all day long.  It is by far the best ALUMINUM and toxic free deodorant I have EVER used.  As far as application is concerned, it is a little bit messy but worth it.  The product crumbles when you scoop it up.  Once you rub it on your underarm it completely melts.  I advise not to rub it too hard as the baking soda is a little bit abrasive could irritate someone with sensitive skin.  I rub any excess deodorant onto my hands or legs and it just disappears.  The scent is AMAZING too.  I highly recommend this product to everyone and will be buying it for friends and family because I hate to see people poisoning themselves with commercial deodorants.</li>
    <li> As someone who used to sweat through antiperspirant and is very self-conscious about body odor, this is truly a great product. Like many, I tried everything. I worked at Whole Foods and was able to try virtually all of the natural deodorants out there and none worked for more than a few days. In all honesty, most were like using nothing at all. Even my Crystal Stick started to smell funky after a few days. It had basically absorbed my BO. Natural deodorants were the number one thing customers asked about in my section. That and shampoo without SLS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Backstory is that my antiperspirant (Secret) seemed to make me smellier over time, more dependent on it, stained my clothes and contained questionable ingredients. I didn&#x27;t want to try the clinical strength version because it just seemed to contain higher concentrations of the bad stuff and I was and am very committed to breaking the habit. I&#x27;ve been using this product for the last three days and am simply amazed. It has reduced my sweating to the point where I don&#x27;t even think I broke a sweat at work today. But the real kicker is that this stuff worked overnight last weekend. I had put it on before we went out for dinner and the next morning I did not smell like cumin. Unprecedented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to continue to search for more natural deodorants but if you are considering this brand, I highly recommend it. Good luck!</li>
    <li> I bought three fragrances of Schmidt&#x27;s Natural Deodorant as gifts.  She loves them and they smell nice.  A little goes a long way.  I&#x27;m sure she will be buying these again.</li>
    <li> Smells nice but doesn&#x27;t keep odour at bay for as long as I expected. The product is quite hard and crumbly from the packaging so quite hard to apply but softens once warmed on the skin.</li>
    <li> This smells very nice and works well for a good 24 hours; after that, you&#x27;re going to smell funky.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! I will never go back to store brand deordorant sticks again!! Smells great and it lasts through a workout and on through the next day, absolutely more effectively than any other deordorant I have ever used, even the &amp;quot;clinical&amp;quot; strength!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is excellent.  I have been trying natural deodorants all summer and by far this is the best.  I&#x27;ve tried Tom&#x27;s which makes the BO smell gross in combination with the deodorant.  The other Tom&#x27;s I tried made my skin red and irritated.  I also tried Primal Pit Paste which worked OK but I had to be aware of how much I put on because that also irritated my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Schmidt&#x27;s suppresses smell and sweat nicely.  You only use a pea sized amount on both underarms.  Unlike other natural products I&#x27;ve tried, this one does not irritate my skin at all.  It is smooth and almost feels like it&#x27;s making my skin better.  I have been using it for a few days and it has been great!  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Chemical burn caution! I ordered the bergamot+lime, ylang-ylang+calendula, and the lavender+sage scents all at once. I used the deodorant as recommended (&amp;#34;massage a pea-sized amount for both arm pits&amp;#34;). At first, I thought the itching/skin peeling was in response to my body&#x27;s expulsion of metals present from a decade of using commercial deodorant. However, the picture attached is after months of using Schmidt&#x27;s. I&#x27;m guessing the response is due to the baking soda. It may work better for those that have underarm hair, but I would not suggest it to those that don&#x27;t grow much hair there or who shave.</li>
    <li> On my third order. The lime is light and this natural deodorant works great,.</li>
    <li> I put this stuff to the real test. I&#x27;ve only used it for one day BUT. I wore a long sleeve denim top and endured the 89 degree summer heat. I felt myself perspiring and usually at this point with Toms, Jason, Crystal Salts, Urban Cowboy (and a few others), I&#x27;d be musky or worse (depending on if the deodorant of choice blends well with my natural b/o). The natural Margarita scent slightly faded but there is no funk. I even had my mother smell me just to make sure and she couldn&#x27;t smell any sign of stinky pits. As for any adverse reaction due to skin allergies I can&#x27;t speak for that yet but it definitely works. I was so excited I had to review it.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Impulse purchase on Prime day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Want to remove chemicals from my diet and hygiene purchases, so I bought this. I love the smell - strong lime and just enough bergamot to remind me of Earl Grey tea. Application is a little weird, I don&#x27;t know why they couldn&#x27;t package it in a slender tube or like a typical click stick. I don&#x27;t rub it between my hands; I use the little applicator to stripe it across my underarm, then I rub my arms back and forth in a rowing motion to even and warm it into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lasts about 12 hours in lightly sweaty conditions. So far has held up at outdoor events in Louisiana heat (over 100 degrees). Probably not for people who are outside ALL day and heavily sporty. May not be great for intense sport activities lasting multiple hours, but works fine for a typical day including occasional heat, an hour walk and some light exercise.</li>
    <li> My favorite thing about this deodorant is that it&#x27;s natural (my first time trying one) and it smells great too.  I tried it out in the Caribbean for 3 weeks and that seemed to be a pretty good test.  I do however wish that the application could be easier.  That being said, I will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful.  It has very few ingredients in it but all of the ingredients are like familiar things.  There&#x27;s no ingredient there that&#x27;s hard to pronounce.  The smell of this deodorant is wonderful.  It smells soooo good.  It&#x27;s almost like you can eat it.  I appreciate the fact that it&#x27;s all natural ad I will continue to buy it.  It comes in a small jar.  The small jar has a little stick in there that you use to scrape out a little product and apply it directly to your underarm.  I wish they would turn this stuff into a rollon though.  I used to use Tom&#x27;s of Maine deodorant for a long time.  It smelled good but it left my underarms smelling funky.  Schmidts leaves me smelling fresh ALL day long.</li>
    <li> amazing,swear by this stuff,the only thing it takes time to apply it and you have to wash your hands with soap few times after it</li>
    <li> This stuff really works! And it is healthy!</li>
    <li> It smells fantastic but did not work as a deodorant. I ended up smelling like bo after a day of work.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 9 year old daughter because I don&#x27;t want her using anything with chemicals. She has no complaints and she doesn&#x27;t smell like sweaty gym socks so this is great! It&#x27;s a little different to apply then a common stick deodorant but that&#x27;s no biggie. There&#x27;s a little spatula to scoop put what you want and apply it to your pits by rubbing it in like a lotion.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this, but after unwrapping the bubble wrap it came in, I found that most of the contents had leaked out and we&#x27;re all over the outside of the jar and in the bubble wrap. It smells great, but I am not keen on paying for only a portion of product. Super bummed especially since I ordered it Prime in order to have it to replace my nearly gone deodorant. I cannot make claims to its effectiveness.</li>
    <li> Where has this stuff been all my life?!  I finally found a natural product that works great after a full day&#x27;s work.  I was layering three different natural deodorants at one point, trying to get them to work and nothing did. I&#x27;ve bought every natural deodorant under the sun in the last two years and still, at the end of the day....stink!  Ugh.  It was frustrating, until I found this product.  It&#x27;s a true god-send.  I did find it a little weird to have to melt it w/ the heat of my fingers to get it to spread under my arms, but found that if I hit it w/ my blowdryer for a couple of seconds, it melts on top like a dream and is like spreading on frosting (and the consistency of frosting, too, when it&#x27;s melted).  I absolutely love it and pray they never stop making it.  Bravo Schmidt&#x27;s!!!  Oh, I also found that I need to spread it about an inch in circumference out from just under my arms so it fully covers my whole underarm area (leaving no room for any stickiness to sneak through).  If you&#x27;re hesitant to try this stuff, don&#x27;t be.  You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> Smells nice and goes on well. It didnt leave any nasty marks on my shirts. After a few uses, i did notice some irritation and had to stop using. I wanted to love this but my quest for aluminum free deodorant continues. Also, i wanted to return it, but with $5 return charge, i figured id keep.</li>
    <li> Irritated skin. Smells good</li>
    <li> This smells good, but something in it irritates my skin.  I will stick with the lavender + sage, which doesn&#x27;t bother my skin.</li>
    <li> I purchased this at a local WholeFoods just to try it out. I initially tried the Ylang calendula which worked alright but this one is a keeper. No harmful ingredients and keeps me relatively dry. I sometimes reapply once more later on in the day, but it keeps me relatively fresh. Try it if you&#x27;re looking for an alternative deodorant.</li>
    <li> It absolutely works. I just don&#x27;t care for the smell which is a strong zesty lime. I love bergamot but I don&#x27;t smell any of that in here. I&#x27;ll try one of the other scents when I finish this jar. So far it looks like it will last two months with daily use, about 1/8 teaspoon under each arm. People say they use less, but it&#x27;s summer and I find I&#x27;m using more.</li>
    <li> this product is certainly one of the best natural deodorants that I&#x27;ve tried. It doesn&#x27;t last all day so I reapply as needed. It&#x27;s on the pricey side since I must reapply often. smells and feels great. I may just use it in the winter since I sweat much less  during that season. I would recommend this to a friend!</li>
    <li> The fragrance is pleasant, however, the past is a little gritty, and a little less easy to use than a similar product.  I have to warm the paste up in my hands before applying it so that it is soft enough to spread, whereas the other product spreads more easily.  Nevertheless, the pleasant fragrance makes it worth putting up with.</li>
    <li> This stuff must be made by wizards out of unicorn horns and rainbows, because it is seriously magical and life-changing...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never loved regular deodorants from the drugstore; no matter how great the fragrance, I felt like I smelled funny by the end of the day.  Even the fragrance-free versions would still react with my body and clothing to leave me with a &amp;#34;damp fabric&amp;#34; smell.  Not great.  Then I moved up a notch to Lavanila--which worked pretty well, but could still turn on me depending on the type of fabric I was wearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, my sister recommended this brand---which I had never even heard of before---and it was life-changing!  Now I dont smell like anything at all--and I&#x27;m free to wear whatever I want!!!!  The fragrance is noticeable in the jar and at the moment when you apply it, but a short time later, you just smell normal.  Like.....nothing in particular.  Like.... you&#x27;re a magical person who clearly doesn&#x27;t have to wear deodorant.  When I take off my sweater, it smells like it did when it came out of the laundry, instead of vaguely like a wet dog!  Freedom!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only minor downside is that it is *slightly* more time-consuming than swiping on a regular deodorant stick.  You take the tiny spatula and scoop up a pea-sized blob for each underarm, then apply it with fingers.  But who cares, because you smell like angels and wishes.....</li>
    <li> I was deeply suspicious about trying anything that is not an anti-perspirant.  However, since going vegan and cruelty-free, I had been using the Tom&#x27;s of Maine antiperspirant and it just was not cutting it for me after several months- made me smell weird and didn&#x27;t stop the sweat.  Someone mentioned Schmidt&#x27;s and although I didn&#x27;t really think it would work, I ordered the Bergamot-Lime scent.  I have to say, it works amazingly well!  It smells great and it actually does keep me dry and I haven&#x27;t smelled any body odor at any given point, even after going for a long run!  I even wore this every day on my recent trip to Florida, where the temp was in the high 80&#x27;s and I was sitting on a hot beach.  This stuff is a winner for sure!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been seeking an organic all natural deodorant. Breast cancer runs heavily in our family, and I really don&#x27;t like the aluminum under the arms. I&#x27;ve been kind of skeptical on whether an effective all natural product exists.  I&#x27;m at that age where I sweat ALOT. I was really pleased with this product. It smells wonderful. And I really haven&#x27;t had any problems with under arm wetness either.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is that the application is a little inconvenient. (You use a little spatula to scoop some out, let it soften in your hands, then rub under your arms)  I&#x27;m willing to put up with this. Way to go Schmidts for a great product.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the fragrance, and it works all day for me. This is the first all-natural, non-aluminum product I have tried that does so. I put a pea-sized amount under my arm and let it melt, then spread around with my fingers. Interesting side benefit - it&#x27;s a good practice to check your armpits (lymph nodes) for lumps when you check your breasts. I realized I haven&#x27;t been doing that when I started applying this deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do sometimes notice a slight dampness during the day, but no accompanying odor. That&#x27;s fine with me. And shaving GENTLY with a new razor helps me avoid any post-shaving irritation which has been mentioned in other reviews. The only other thing I have noticed is some minor itchiness, which again, I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using for about two weeks and so far, I haven&#x27;t experienced the skin issues some people have to the baking soda. I had a terrible reaction to Toms all natural deodorant, so hopefully Schmidt&#x27;s will continue to work with my skin. I think this product works and smells great, and I don&#x27;t mind applying with my hands, I just wash them afterwards.  UPDATE: 3 months later, and I still love this product! DON&#x27;T apply immediately after shaving, I got a rash, but it went away after a few days of not using. And since then (yes, even though I was nervous, I went back to using this product), I haven&#x27;t had an issue if I wait to apply after shaving. Even waiting just 20 minutes is fine. I typically give myself a break, and don&#x27;t use anything if I&#x27;m not leaving the house, and I&#x27;ve noticed that if I don&#x27;t use enough, I&#x27;m a little stinky by bed time. But, wait, what?! Stinky by bed time when I apply at 7am? That&#x27;s not a complaint!  Also, I&#x27;m just ordering for the 2nd time after 3 months, so this product really lasts!</li>
    <li> I have gone through at least 5 or 6 products that were organic that just do not work.  This one does, and I don&#x27;t have to use it everyday. I don&#x27;t like how you have to apply it but I will get over it since it works.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 3 months. I have both the Bergamot + Lime scent and the Lavendar + Sage scent. I use the Bergamot + Lime more because I like the scent better. It has lasted well. I have been using it pretty consistently for 3 months and there is a little less than a quarter of it left in the bottle. You have to warm it up between your fingers for a couple of seconds before you apply it - easy in the summer but sometimes a little harder to get it to soften up in the winter. I have applied it after taking a shower and even after having shaved my underarms and I have not personally experienced any of the reactions that some other people have posted here. I did experience a little bit of itching when I first started using it but it went away after about a week or two of using it and has not bothered me since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched to this product from Arrid Extra Extra Dry. I find it to be very effective. At first I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in the amount of sweating but over time I found that I sweat less now after making the switch. It lasts all day and I have had no need to re-apply it during the day. One thing that it is not as effective at is using it for a &amp;#34;deodorant re-charge&amp;#34;.  If I already smell bad then applying this deodorant doesn&#x27;t help as much as the Arrid did - probably because it doesn&#x27;t contain the strong fragrance chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I really like the product and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I have tried literally EVERY natural deodorant under the sun. EVERY SINGLE ONE! They are all either sticky, smelly or simply don&#x27;t work. I read in a magazine Alicia Silverstone uses this so gave it a try. I wasn&#x27;t crazy about rubbing my armpits with my fingers every morning but the way this works, I don&#x27;t mind! Smells super fresh, not overly strong. Melts right into the skin with no sticky feeling. I sweat like crazy all the time and this keeps me dry and smelling fresh. I&#x27;ve tried this scent and the lavendar. Both are awesome. My husband is curious about it and is thinking about trying too (lime could pass for guys I think!). We both have always worn aluminum free deodorants.</li>
    <li> Wow! This stuff is great. I have sensitive skin and while this does sting a bit when applied, it goes away and I&#x27;m more than willing to endure it to avoid using aluminum. I&#x27;m really impressed with how this keeps the stink away... Other natural deodorants I&#x27;ve tried didn&#x27;t have any power against odor. Highly recommend and would like to try the lavender one next.</li>
    <li> What can I say??? I love this stuff. It&#x27;s great. Smells great. Keeps the stinkies out of my pits. This is my favorite of the line, but to be honest they all smell good. Hope it works for you!</li>
    <li> Works great. Prevents body odor and doesn&#x27;t leave a funky smell when combined with sweat. Will be ordering again and again.</li>
    <li> Wow! I can&#x27;t believe how well this works! The scent is amazing too! Wow! I can&#x27;t wait to try the others when this one runs out!</li>
    <li> For an all natural deodorant, this works great! The main ingredient is baking soda, which is why it works so well but it is combined with other ingredients so it doesn&#x27;t feel abrasive. If there is anything it can be improved upon is that you have to apply with your fingers-wish there was a stick version. Love it!</li>
    <li> Hopefully deodorants will continue to improve, but this is a good start for someone allergic to antiperspirant.</li>
    <li> Love the scent.  Love the product.  Just wish I received a full jar.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never tried a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorant before, and certainly never one you apply with a stick. But I love the scent of this Bergamot &amp; Lime deodorant. Even better are the all natural ingredients!&lt;br /&gt;Applying with a stick took a little getting used to and often I&#x27;ll just use my fingertips. Does it work? Do I smell? haha!!&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that it works great! If I apply in the morning after showering I have NOT had any body odor for the entire day (have not tried it prior to working out).</li>
    <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t work for me at all. Wish I could send it back but they don&#x27;t take returns. $15 later. Gah.</li>
    <li> I love the scent and the fact that I didn&#x27;t seem to perspire as much as I thought I would.  I would give it 5 stars, but it did cause some irritation, so I can&#x27;t use it everyday.</li>
    <li> Great natural deodorant, nice smell and keeps you dry.</li>
    <li> my favorite deodorant! Keeps me fresh &amp; odor-free!</li>
    <li> I really do like this deodorant. I&#x27;ve tried a wide range but this is the only brand I have actually stuck with. This particular scent smells really good and fresh and I stay stench free all day. I just use my fingers to apply it which actually isn&#x27;t that bad since it&#x27;s got a nice baking soda/essential oil consistency so it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s a slimey sticky mess.</li>
    <li> Here are my own tips as you can read mixed reviews about it from being amazing to causing irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Do NOT use a lot. Do NOT strongly rub it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little amount  goes a long way and less prone to irritation.&lt;br /&gt;I use the mini spatula to scoop out and put it on my left palm. I then take my index finger and apply a little ball and bring my arm down for a moment. The heat from your body will soften it and then \\&quot;gently\\&quot;  spread under your armpit.  I stress this due to the fact that I have tried just rubbing it in strongly and have found that my skin gets red and irritated. Unfortunately there is not much that can be done as baking soda has a tendency to cause irritation but the idea of  less is more with a gentle approach  is helping.</li>
    <li> I really LOVE this product!  It keeps me odor free and lasts all day long - including gym time.  Other deodorants (Dove, Degree, Secret) did not last as long/keep me as odor free as this one.  This is not an antiperspirant, so my underarms were definitely more moist, but I&#x27;m willing to put up with that to be odor free - just need to wear dress shields.  Additionally, I feel that since I&#x27;ve used this product, I actually have begun to perspire LESS.  I&#x27;ve read that this can happen as a result of using a natural deodorant.  I also love the smell of this particular deodorant - not too sweet, not too tart...  Just right.  The only downside for me, and the reason I&#x27;ve withheld a star, is the bad reaction my skin has had to this product :(  After about a week&#x27;s worth of daily use, I noticed that my underarm area became irritated, itchy, and dry.  They also turned red and a felt as though I&#x27;d had windburn.  I stopped using it for a couple of weeks and my skin returned to normal.  I loved the product so much, that I started to use it again, but alas, my skin had the same reaction.  Some others have posted similar sensitive-skin reactions, so I guess I&#x27;m just one of the unlucky ones.  This is a great product though, and if you don&#x27;t have terribly sensitive skin, I totally recommend it!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t found anything to work as well, though it still doesn&#x27;t help with perspiration.  Will be buying more when this runs out!</li>
    <li> Smells good. organic. works good.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. The smell is great, I had no idea what bergamot smelled like, but I&#x27;m glad I made the gamble! It smells wonderfully!&lt;br /&gt;2. I had no body ordor or ever smelled badly when wearing the product- it works!&lt;br /&gt;3. You get a fair amount of product for the price, this little jar has a lot in it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. You have to use a little scooper to dig it out, and then use your fingers to rub on and apply. While this isn&#x27;t the end of the world, I hate getting anything under my finger nails that I have to dig out (like when you&#x27;re gardening and you have dirt under your nails). With this product I couldn&#x27;t just put it on, there&#x27;s a bit of a process to get it on, then wipe it off your hands, etc. It&#x27;s not the end of the world though, so don&#x27;t let it stop you.&lt;br /&gt;2. I sometimes felt like I was sweating more because of it. I would rotate this one with my other deodorant (Norwex crystal deodorant) and I noticed one day that I always seemed to be wetter under the arms than when I used the Norwex one. Everyone&#x27;s body is different though, so it could just be me, or it could have just been a coincidence? I&#x27;m honestly not sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a pretty good option to try. I have tried plenty of other brands of natural deodorants that I hated and thought were a waste of money (Tom&#x27;s, Ava Anderson, etc.). But again, everyone&#x27;s body is different and we all respond to products differently. I would recommend giving this one a try. Other good ones are the Norwex crystal (but through a consultant so it&#x27;s not a knock off), and Primal Pit Paste (here on Amazon). My husband likes the Pit Paste.</li>
    <li> Only used it a couple times, but the smell of this stuff is great.  Getting used to the application process... totally worth the benefits.</li>
    <li> This brand is the best.  I just love this deodorant.</li>
    <li> Love the smell but this product broke me out. Tried it two different times, a couple days each. Switched to Crystals, much better</li>
    <li> It initially smells nice, but I find that once half a day has passed it doesn&#x27;t hold up well. I also can&#x27;t re-wear a shirt when I use this deodorant. (I usually wear my dry clean blouses a few times before sending them to the cleaner.) I am sure it is because it is not an anti-antiperspirant, but the smell of my sweat combined with this deodorant on a worn shirt is 10x more putrid than just my sweat alone.</li>
    <li> this is the best working natural deoderant i have ever used, passed the sniff test AFTER the gym, however it really bothered my skin, maybe only the lime scent, i may try others</li>
    <li> After using it for three days, I got a rash on my armpits that smelled oddly of cat litter.  Loved it before that happened - stopped using it until the rash healed and then tried it again - cat littler pits came back.  I do have sensitive skin.  I believe the rash may be due to the baking soda.</li>
    <li> It smells nice and works ok but the tiny container was only half full after it melted all over the box.</li>
    <li> This is the hands down the best natural deodorant I have found. And It smells fantastic (although it&#x27;s not too strong of a fragrance to feel over powering). Would highly recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> Excellent alternative to the toxic ingredients of regular deoderants/antipersperants. This works even better than my old antipersperant. No odor whatsoever and I run and ride in hot humid Houston!&lt;br /&gt;Just wish the price was more reasonable.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells amazing. I have the lavender sage and I&#x27;m almost out so decided to buy bergamot lime to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One problem it came with the lid partially off and was a little messy in the envelope. It&#x27;s like 85° out so it melted and ran out of the jar a little.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have this problem with the lavender sage so it might&#x27;ve just been a fluke and I will buy this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a heads up to Amazon to check out the product to make sure the lid is on before mailing it.</li>
    <li> I apparently didn&#x27;t read closely enough, but this is a really small container for the price! However, it doesn&#x27;t take much on a daily basis and it smells fantastic. It&#x27;s really &amp;#34;limey&amp;#34;, but I like that! You can&#x27;t see it on your clothes or arms and it comes off cleanly.</li>
    <li> After 1 month of use I prefer the purely great Women&#x27;s Citrus Cream Deodorant which has better odor neutralization and antiperspirant function. The best thing about the Schmidt&#x27;s deodorant is that it comes with its own applicator and is relatively inexpensive.</li>
    <li> Best deodorant ever! Thank you schmidt&#x27;s :) I feel soo fresh even by 35 C</li>
    <li> Really like it. A bit messy to put on though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for a natural deodorant. I first tried the Lavender/Sage scent and just hated the smell. It&#x27;s has a strong herb scent, which is not what I prefer. The Bergamot/Lime is a nice fragrance (a bit tropical), and it does fade quickly. I will say that the minute I started sweating, it completely failed me. Unfortunately, this didn&#x27;t work for me. But, if you&#x27;re looking for a natural deodorant and don&#x27;t plan on sweating, this would be a good choice.</li>
    <li> I recently moved to Florida and never before have I experienced body odor. I prefer to use deodorants without aluminum.  Every product I tried did not keep me odor free as I sweat through my yoga classes. The Schmidt&#x27;s Bergamot-Lime does the job. It is an adjustment to use your finger&#x27;s to apply the product but after a time or two, no problem. This has a wonderful fresh lime scent and I no longer fear having body odor while working out. I love this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a natural alternative for underarm odor that actually works and Schmidt&#x27;s is great.  I leave the pea size amount I scoop out with the spatula under my arms for a few minutes while I do other things and it naturally melts so it&#x27;s very easy to spread around.  This product doesn&#x27;t prevent the wetness but nothing else does for me either (clinical strength) so I just need to be careful to wear things that don&#x27;t show wetness.  However the body odor control is great and I do enjoy the lime smell immensely and wish it would last longer.</li>
    <li> The way I originally found out about this product was from reading it as a favorite product from actress Alicia Silverstone.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried natural deodorants before, and was usually disappointed from them, not living up to the expectations of what traditional deodorants full of chemicals do. I would switch back to the \\&quot;bad stuff\\&quot; because I couldn&#x27;t find a great natural product like Schmidt&#x27;s handcrafted organic deodorant.  I LOVE IT! I have been using it for about 2 weeks now, and  if you had any doubts in giving this a shot, trust me I have never even left a review on Amazon as of yet but I thought it was worth letting others know that they should try it out. After coming out of the shower, it is enjoyable to smell the scent of Bergamot &amp; Lime under your arms, and even though it does fade away later, it does the job of keeping you stink-free! It takes used to changing from rolling a deodorant stick under your arm, to applying it with your hands but I do not mind-- I think if I put lotion on my face, I do not complain about doing that because this is what we all do, so this is just another thing you do in that manner.&lt;br /&gt;Personally I have not had any bad reactions to it like I read from some reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Hope my review helps someone out :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;  I have had a reaction to it if I put it on right after shaving my underarms. I have found a way to use this where I recommend that you do not put it on right after you have shaved. If you take a shower at night and shave, then do not put anything on and let the skin rest, and then the next morning when you shower, then apply at that time.&lt;br /&gt;I just purchased my second one, and yes it is not a perfect deodorant but I would rather deal with this inconvenience then put on toxic ingredients in my body from mainstream deodorants.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this product! It is amazing. I have always had to use extra strength deodorants and had lots of irritation under my arms. I have been wanting to try this for awhile now but the price made me think on it awhile. I finally broke down and got some. The sweat control is great I have noticed less underarm rings in the 3 days I&#x27;ve been using it. I am having a little irritation under one arm but it is totally worth the benefits of not using aluminium products. I am definitely happy with this purchase and will be trying the other scents too. I was a little disappointed that it leaked so much in the box. It was a little pricy for it to leak.</li>
    <li> works well and got in a timely manner</li>
    <li> One of the few natural deodorants that actually works! The bergamot lime scent smells like skittles.</li>
    <li> Finally, a vegan deodorant that works! I have tried MANY other natural deodorants, and resigned myself to coping with their failure to stop odors completely. This one smells great and even after the scent fades, works perfectly.  Even after working out or being outside on a hot summer day, it completely blocks any sweat odors.  The minor inconvenience of applying it with your fingers is so worth having a natural deodorant that is cruelty free and does what it is supposed to!</li>
    <li> First the positive. This product works. The scent is pleasant and subtle, not at all overpowering. I also ordered the Lavender-Sage scent, and that is pleasing as well. I think it works better than Degree or Secret, the brands I had been using prior. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is that the product is very crumbly. I think I expected it to be creamier. Once I get it to my underarms it starts to soften very quickly and sinks in just fine. It&#x27;s just the texture of it from the little spatula they give you to my fingertips to my underarms that&#x27;s a little tricky to deal with. Other than that, it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I did not think that applying this deodorant on a daily basis would be as inconvenient as it is. Just getting out of the shower and then having to get your hands all oily with this deodorant and then smearing it on your armpits isn&#x27;t an enjoyable experience. What I can say though, is that the performance of the product makes it all worth it. It really does work, which we can all agree is generally not the strongest attribute of most &#x27;natural&#x27; deodorants. For other whiny babies like me though, seriously consider your determination to go through the daily application ritual required from this product. I am going to buy another less effective deodorant to use on the days that I can&#x27;t bring myself to apply it.</li>
    <li> Best deodorant I have ever had!!!!</li>
    <li> This product works for me.  I usually sweat pretty heavy and often when I&#x27;m not all that sweaty my armpits stink. This product kills odor. It seems like I don&#x27;t even develop the same odor since using this product. I have been using it for one week. 4 stars instead of 5 because it didn&#x27;t come with the spatula it said to use in the instructions, and it is a little more work to apply than a stick. Overall I do like this product and will purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other products I have tried that failed me: Arm and Hammer baking soda deodorant, Jason Lavender Deodorant, Jason Tea Tree Deodorant and Nature&#x27;s Gate.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Schmidt&#x27;s Natural Deodorant for about four months now, and I can honestly say, without exaggeration, that this is the very best deodorant I have ever used.  There is no hint of any odor even when I&#x27;ve skipped a day.  You&#x27;ll have to get passed applying the deodorant with your hand--it took me a couple of days.  One thing that helped me adjust was thinking about the fact that I was handling something non-toxic, unlike the commercial deodorant I had always used previously.  You can feel good handling this product and rubbing it into your skin.  And you won&#x27;t need much at all.  This product will last a LONG time.  After four months, I am not even halfway through the container.  A great product!  I&#x27;m sold on it for life.</li>
    <li> smells great but ultimately it didn&#x27;t work for me and it was very difficult to get out of the jar and apply. Kind of messy.</li>
    <li> Love this deodorant and the scent. It is so refreshing compared to others on the market.</li>
    <li> Will not purchase this one again. Once you scrape off the top layer of product, the middle of the jar is completely hollow. So you&#x27;re not getting as much product as you think. More importantly, I find that it doesn&#x27;t control B.O. as well as some of the other natural (organic) options on the market. I wouldn&#x27;t mind having to scrape the product out of the jar &amp; apply with your fingers (vs. a roll-on) if it worked, but unfortunately this one is a miss for me.</li>
    <li> Fabulous! I initially bought this deodorant after researching cruelty free products. Schmidt&#x27;s is Leaping Bunny certified and the Cruelty Free Kitty blog recommended it so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. It smells clean and fresh and works great. The best part is you can use it with a clear conscience. Very impressed and would recommend this to everyone!</li>
    <li> Well, it holds okay for me, but it doesn&#x27;t last as long as the more expensive natural brand I was using prior. The biggest problem is that I gave it to my mother and it caused a pretty bad skin reaction for her after a few weeks of light usage. I know I took a chance in buying it because others had the same complaint. I just figured it it would be okay, since it has many of the same ingredients as the other deodorant my family prefers.    Anyway, I went back to the pricier stuff from Etsy. It works better and smells better. If you have sensitive skin, don&#x27;t mess with this stuff.    Update:  Bumping this to two stars, as my sister stuck with using this after my mother stopped. She actually prefers it to the other brand (Fat and the Moon - sorry I didn&#x27;t mention it before) because it&#x27;s quite a bit thicker (think: the consistency of raw shea butter) and doesn&#x27;t run down her arms when the weather is hot. She says it keeps her dryer. It hasn&#x27;t caused any adverse skin reactions for her either. But I maintain, if you have sensitive or easily irritable skin, this deodorant is really best avoided.</li>
    <li> I have been trying literally for YEARS to get away from conventional aluminum-based deodorants, but always ended up going back to them because nothing else worked! Not only were other natural products ineffective (especially under stress), but they were also unpleasantly sticky, oily and/or left a residue on my shirts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff? Is AMAZING. I apply it right after my shower and it works for a full 24 hours. I will still sweat a little bit (since it&#x27;s not an antiperspirant) but it keeps me stink-free through a hot summer day, which even my conventional antiperspirant/deodorants could not always do. I tried this scent, the lavender sage, and the fragrance-free version. All are equally effective, and the scent dissipates within a short time anyway, so it&#x27;s mostly a matter of personal choice. I scoop out a little bit with the spatula, rub it between my hands to warm and soften it, then lightly massage it into the underarm area. No worse than applying body butter, and it leaves my skin soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not try applying this directly after shaving or waxing, but I also would not do the same with a conventional product. Definitely wait a little bit to let your skin recover first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: it works great, and I&#x27;m telling everyone I know about it!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love. Very different from a normal &amp;#34;deodorant experience&amp;#34;, if there is such a thing. Smells great, works very well and no yucky fake stuff or aluminum. Awesome alternative.</li>
    <li> Best scent so far. I smell like a citrus orchard. Love it. Well worth the duckets and weird manner of application.</li>
    <li> i am hesitant to write this - i really wanted to love this. i love the packaging, i love the smell, i love that it&#x27;s natural. unfortunately, i hate the application and it doesn&#x27;t really do anything more than any other natural deodorant i&#x27;ve tried. i&#x27;ve used it for about 4 months now and i still sweat and it masks the smell ok, not excellent. the application is awful. it&#x27;s crumbly to get out, then you have to roll it between your fingers to warm it up, and them smear it on. not fun. if it worked, i would deal with the application, but i wish there was a natural deodorant that stopped the sweating instead of just masking the smell.</li>
    <li> The most affective natural deodorant I&#x27;ve found. Smells great and keeps the BO under control.</li>
    <li> LOVE the smell.  I am highly reactive to artificial smells, but this is absolutely delicious. And it does work.  I&#x27;m not loving the application method... at all... which bums me out because I like the product so much.</li>
    <li> I have been using natural deodorants for a couple years now, and as we all know, some work, some don&#x27;t. Obviously I will still sweat a little, but I have found that baking soda is an essential component to eliminate odor. A lot of the other ones just use essential oils to mask it. what is great about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t leave a white mess, and while i may sweat a little, there is no odor. it smells nice too.</li>
    <li> Too messy for me. I now use the rock salt crystal.</li>
    <li> Worked great in the beginning after a month it started breaking me out.</li>
    <li> Smell is divine: I love Bergamot and I love lime so I knew I would love the scent and the product itself is easy to apply and is soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t however cover odor for me :/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw another review like this as well too; mine was half melted, an oil mess everywhere.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!! I&#x27;ve never found anything that had worked this well, I love it!</li>
    <li> Initially, I really LOVED this deodorant. Smells great, no undesirable ingredients. The only caveat was the application method: it&#x27;s very inconvenient. But it&#x27;s long-lasting, and the great smell definitely makes up for that. Unfortunately, about 2 weeks into using the product, I began to get a rash and terrible skin peeling under my arms. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but my pH balance is very easily thrown off. I really loved the product but had to discontinue use! I would definitely recommend to someone with no sensitivity issues!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I really appreciate the feedback from Schmidt&#x27;s! Using less has made a drastic diference! I now prefer the stick (wasn&#x27;t originally available) but this is great too!</li>
    <li> I have tried hundred of natural deo&#x27;s trying to find one that works.  This product not only works it smell edible.  I only had to apply it once per day, verse multiple times.  And I have even gone 2 days, through a shower and still had coverage.  Threw my liquid rock, Tom&#x27;s and Natures gate out!</li>
    <li> I got 5 painful bumps in my armpit after using this product for about 2 weeks. My doctor said it was clogged sweat glands. I&#x27;ve never had this before &amp; it was very painful. I&#x27;ve stopped using this product &amp; am going back to primal pit paste cuz it works great &amp; doesn&#x27;t cause issues.</li>
    <li> The jar arrived half empty and there was no seal.  It smells nice, but I&#x27;m scared to try it.  Was it used??</li>
    <li> This product is ok, but not great. I found another brand that goes on easier without the fuss.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I only have to apply it once a day, even when I&#x27;m working outside in 100 degree weather. Plus, I&#x27;m allergic to all but one kind of store bought, (even so called organic) and I can use this without a problem! It takes a couple days to get used to the difference in application, but we&#x27;ll worth everything.</li>
    <li> I really want to like this. Great scent and worked really well until it gave me a rash:( It&#x27;s a good product but may not be for everyone.</li>
    <li> Happy!!!  Love it and works grate.</li>
    <li> The product and packaging are really nice, the scent is pleasant and it is easy to apply. Unfortunately, after about 10 days of use, it caused a very painful rash. This is apparently due to its very high baking soda content, which makes its pH not skin-friendly.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t worn antiperspirant in about five years because of the dangers associated with heavy metals and other toxic chemicals found in these products. During this time, I have tried several brands of natural deodorant, including Nature&#x27;s Gate, Kiss My Face, Thai, Tom&#x27;s, EO, and Jason. I appreciate that these were all natural products, but if I had a particularly active day, I could smell my body odor, sometimes mixed with whatever floral or herbal fragrance that was in the deodorant - yuck!  It made me self-conscious. I finally tried to make my own deodorant, which worked rather effectively, but was a huge mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found Schmidt&#x27;s on Etsy, and searching for reviews led me to Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jar is small, but you really only need a dime-size amount. The little spatula is nice, but you will still get it on your hands when you rub it in (like lotion). I apply it directly with the spatula, then rub it in. The texture is a little grainy, like baking soda. This particular scent is light and citrus. I really like it, but I don&#x27;t really smell it after I dress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part is, it works. It absolutely works. The first week, I had some mild irritation, but nothing too bad. I&#x27;m so happy that I smell nothing at all during the day, even in during the Alabama summer heat. I don&#x27;t seem to sweat so much, either. Although, I personally think we&#x27;re supposed to sweat. I&#x27;m also happy that I can pronounce the ingredients. This is a great natural product with no sacrifice on quality. The jar should last a long time, and then I plan to buy another. Thanks Schmidt!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**3/2015 Update**&lt;br /&gt;I changed my 5 star review to 3 because after a few weeks, my skin became so irritated by this product that I had to stop using anything for awhile. It is still very effective as deodorant, but I have to add a little lotion to it before using to keep from getting an itchy red rash. I&#x27;m changing to 3 stars because mixing it with lotion and applying is messy and inconvenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**10/2016 Update**&lt;br /&gt;I switched to the Schmidt&#x27;s sensitive stick deodorant in Tea Tree and have zero problems with itching or irritation since. It works great and smells fresh!nvenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**10/2016 Update**&lt;br /&gt;I switched to the Schmidt&#x27;s sensitive stick deodorant in Tea Tree and have zero problems with itching or irritation since. It works great and smells fresh!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my run with different natural deodorants and this is the BEST!</li>
    <li> This smells so good and it works better than other natural deodorants I&#x27;ve tried.  It&#x27;s my new favorite product.</li>
    <li> Love the scent, keeps me feeling fresh all day long.</li>
    <li> My fave! It smells amazing, I have it in lavender too!</li>
    <li> I am not very sure if it really works for me. But I&#x27;m going to try to put this on again and see if it will work on me. Like I said, I don&#x27;t like with a scent on the deodorant because when I start to sweat, I can smell myself that is unpleasant. So from now on, I will choose the \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; deodorant. And I don&#x27;t like that it is in the jar. I&#x27;ll rather have it on the stick. I will update this product soon.</li>
    <li> So far so good!! Just nice to have no odor.... I keep checking thru the day because I have always had an odor after 2-4 hours after starting my day.... I hope this is the remedy I have been searching for. Thank you to the maker!!</li>
    <li> I tried this for a month and I have to say for someone who&#x27;s never been aware of her body odor, I smelled noticeably terrible during the day at the office (to the point I was embarrassed and self conscious) and provided no help when I was exercising.  Sorry, I really wanted to like this, but would not purchase it again or recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have searched on and off for years for a vegan, cruelty free deodorant that works. This is the only one I&#x27;ve found that does more than cover up body odor, as well as working as an antiperspirant. Also, the scent is heavenly. Every time I use it, I smell faintly of lime popsicle. Bravo, Schmidt&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> I have not been able to find a natural deodorant I like, but so far this works really well. I have to get used to not feeling completely dry under my arms but there is no smell and I love the fresh lime of this scent. So far this works great, I wore it a graduation where I was super hot the entire time and still no odor and I felt much dryer than if I had had nothing on. A great alternative to traditional deodorants that have harmful chemicals in them.</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff!  I&#x27;m so thrilled to find something that actually works (better than the toxic stuff, it seems) and is not harmful.  Slightly odd method of application, but I am over it.  Great results so far, and I love the scent.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the smell of this product, but like many others, it caused a nasty rash under my arms. I only achieved about 2-3 weeks of solid use out of it and it worked to keep odor at bay. If it weren&#x27;t for the rash, I would repurchase- hopefully this product doesn&#x27;t cause irritation for someone else.</li>
    <li> AWESOME,!!! I usually make my own with similar ingredients....but this is so easy and smells great! Works well!&lt;br /&gt;Def buying more.</li>
    <li> i was skeptical of this product but I gave it a try anyway. I have been odor free and dry since I applied it this morning. If it continues, when ice finished I will be ordering this again.</li>
    <li> Works great - at first. I was completely amazed for the first few weeks, but eventually it just kinda stops working. I&#x27;m not sure if it has something to do with the formula, or maybe it&#x27;s more potent on top, or maybe my skin just adjusted. Either way, I can&#x27;t put it on at all anymore because it almost makes things worse!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to switch to something else for a while and maybe come back to a fresh jar in a few months.</li>
    <li> At first I loved this product, it really worked at covering up my odor. I would not stink at all, I would wear it all day even after my boot camp workouts. But the ultimate test was when i went to Disneyland and it was very hot, this deodorant did not stand a chance......i was very self conscious and very stinky by mid day. I have really bad BO I inherited it from my mom- thanks mom......  :( So any ways it works really well but then the rash came along....my armpits were red, itchy, super dry and then they turned really black. Now I did read reviews about this, depending on the color of your skin, your pigmentation has something to do with it blah blah blah. I used this product for about a month and I waited for it to go away. It would go away and then come back till I had about enough. This isn&#x27;t my first time trying to go organic on deodorant. I&#x27;ve tried Toms, Kiss my Face, &amp; EO organic Lavender Spray. I thought I hit the jackpot when I read about the top ten organic deodorants on mindbodygreen website.  I still wanted to go organic so I did some research and I found another brand of deodorant without baking soda (brand:Meow Meow Tweet). And guess what it works way better than this!!! My armpits are no longer black or red they are actually getting lighter!!! So ladies, I would do research and look at different brands. I do love the smell of this and the lavender sage deodorant. Hope this review helps!!!</li>
    <li> great stuff! Although after a period of time using it I have to take a break from it as I do get a little rash. I am sure this is from the baking soda and arrowroot. Makes it a little gritty but still, I would rather take a little break every now and again than have stink always.</li>
    <li> Yes, it works! And by work I mean that it deodorizes. Don&#x27;t expect it to be an antiperspirant. It doesn&#x27;t have aluminum. This is a good thing. That being said, the baking soda in it seems to absorb some of the sweat, or something because I&#x27;m less wet wearing this than Toms of Maine. No odor even when I wake up the next morning. It works great. The scent I got was the bergamot and lime which smells nice and fresh when first applying but is barely noticeable as the day goes on. Just fresh and no BO. Its great. The application process is the only turn off, and the possibility of the baking soda causing a reaction, (which I&#x27;d prefer to clogging up my glands and getting cancer from chemicals in regular deodorant) but small prices to pay for a natural deodorant that does its job!</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this. The smell when I opened the jar was awesome. It smelled like a margarita-ish smell. Very clean. But when I put it on, my body chemistry did not mix well with it. All I could smell was the bergamot and it smelled rotten to me. Then again I am pregnant so some things don&#x27;t smell normal to me right now. But the initial smell was very lovely and it does work quite well. I stayed clean smelling for about 24 hours. Next time I&#x27;ll try another scent. Good product to use though.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by someone who works at my local Sprouts store. I loved it and it worked great but it gave me a rash. I read on the website that it really needs to be diluted as much as possible before applying to help avoid a rash. I found another one that works just as well but thought I might give Schmidt&#x27;s a try again at some point in the future this time diluting it a bit more before applying. I&#x27;m also very sensitive to scents but this didn&#x27;t bother me at all. In fact, it smells really good. I do recommend that people try this because if it works for you, you will love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a bicycle mechanic, so fairly active. This stuff works really well. No odor. Wish the scent was stronger. No irritation from the baking soda but my GF experienced burning (though she has sensitive skin). Have reapplied in the morning as many as three days in a row.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been so pleased with the performance of this deodorant but like others, i&#x27;ve developed a rash - first on one side and then on both.  it&#x27;s particularly uncomfortable because i also run.  this keeps me dry and smelling better than absolutely any other deodorant but the rash means i have to let it go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve also used soapwalla (i like the consistency of the soapwalla product better because you don&#x27;t have to dig the deodorant out with the included spatula) which has a great scent as well - i tried schmidt&#x27;s because it was more affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m going to try doing as another reviewer suggested and not use after shaving (but sadly that cuts down it&#x27;s effectiveness - after showering/shaving, i put on deodorant)</li>
    <li> I really like this brand but occasionally get itchy. It may be a slight allergy to the scent!</li>
    <li> Honestly amazing. I&#x27;ve tried for years, on and off, to use natural deoderant. I always felt stinky by the middle of the day, even if i was just sitting at my desk. I put this stuff on and didn&#x27;t notice anything all day. Which is a GOOD thing! Then I worked out and still didn&#x27;t smell. UNBELIEVABLE. And good for you. This is my new one and only deoderant!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using drug store antiperspirants for years (which never really worked all that well anyway) and finally made the switch to natural deodorants.  I&#x27;ve been using Schmidt&#x27;s (Bergamot Lime) for a few weeks now and am surprised by how much I like it.  It actually seems to be controlling wetness better (I can sweat at the drop of a hat) and odor control is good.  I wouldn&#x27;t say it was great because at the end of the day if I have been more active than my usual &amp;#34;staring-at-my-computer office job&amp;#34; there is a slight sourness, but not bad at all. I&#x27;ve never felt like I had to re-apply.  I am subtracting a star for delivery method. My house is always on the cool side so it can be kind of crumbly when digging out with the spatula.  But it does get soft quick when you rub in.  The smell is divine but wish it lasted longer.</li>
    <li> due to the fact that this deodorant is in a jar it is very hard to apply. It works and smells perfectly but the application causes lots of trouble. I always have to wash my hands after application which makes it hard to take outside of the house. The deodorant doesn&#x27;t melt, I really don&#x27;t know why the producer didn&#x27;t decide to make it in stick.</li>
    <li> Spatula was buried in container because I ordered during warm weather.&lt;br /&gt;Not a fan of having to apply with my hand.&lt;br /&gt;SMELL IS GREAT!!!! It does last.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve struggled for years with trying to find a deodorant/antiperspirant that worked.  No matter what brand I tried (Secret, Dove, Suave, clinical strength, dermatologist recommended, etc) within a few weeks of using it, it would just stop working.  I would get this kind of weird, sour sweat/deodorant smell, and I would still sweat.  I ordered the Bergamont and Lime scent, never thinking it would actually work.  After a few days of using this, all smell went away, including on the days I had forgotten to put it on!  I think the traditional deodorant/antiperspirants were actually making me smell and sweat worse!  Granted, it is not an antiperspirant and I will still sweat on occasion, but not as bad as before.  It is slightly irritating to my skin, but I&#x27;m hoping it will go away, and it&#x27;s worth it to have something that works!  I will definitely be reordering this - it makes you think what all those chemicals in traditional products may be doing with your body chemistry!</li>
    <li> Sage is more feminine in smell as compared to this one.  The product is very hard but the best way to apply is still to use a finger whether you use the scoop to get it out or not.  Who wouldn&#x27;t wash their hands after putting this on?  :)  My wife makes this same product with coconut oil and it is a little softer and much cheaper to make but this product is good and it does keep me from smelling the whole day.  I&#x27;ve used some of the other stick products from here and they don&#x27;t last all day.</li>
    <li> This deodorant smells delicious, however...It is gritty when you put it on, the grit feels like baking soda? I have eczema and need to be gluten free. I broke out in a horrific rash of pus filled hives. I am assuming it might be due to cornstarch (which make eczema worse) or the baking soda? Perhaps it was just the other ingredients. It is too bad, you sweat, but do not smell...however, pus filled hives not worth it.</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant. I have tried natural deodorants before but found they didn&#x27;t work for long. This stuff lasts longer and really smells good.</li>
    <li> I am just a little disappointed because during the transport, the product moved inside the box and there is some product in the pocket-package. So I don&#x27;t know if the product arrive right (with the good consistency) because a lot of product was outside the container! It is very rare for me to receive a product like this because in general everything is perfect! I presume I have just loose some product.... even if, I am wondering if the product is not normally more soft?? Because I have something very granular and maybe without the loss of product it would have been softer....</li>
    <li> I really like it because it doesn&#x27;t have the aluminium in it but wished it was a little bit stronger protection.</li>
    <li> Love it! It has surpassed every &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorant I&#x27;ve tried... and I&#x27;ve tried many. This is as effective as many conventional deodorants I&#x27;ve used, and it smells awesome. Yes, you use your fingers to apply it (it&#x27;s like putting on lotion, or body butter), yes it takes an extra 30 seconds; big deal.  It&#x27;s so good!!! Plus it comes in a cute little jar:)</li>
    <li> I read about this product from the comparison done by Kris Car (Crazy Sexy Cancer).  It&#x27;s fantastic!  I was using another organic line, same scent, but a few hours into the day I was battling some serious BO.  It was awful.  Bought one to keep at my desk so I could reapply at work, but at the end of the day I was still not smelling pleasant.  Plus, by reapplying it, it was building up on my clothes.  So, back to Kris Car.  I read her reviews, gave Schmidt&#x27;s a try because of the review and the price.  This product is the real deal.  Lasts all day, all night.  No build up on my clothes.  You just take about 1/16th tsp (with the tiny spatula that comes inside the jar), let it warm in your hand, and rub it in.  I will be purchasing this in the future.  Really happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Story time: Almost two years ago now, I got very into figuring out what was in my body products (TALK ABOUT A SHOCKER). I tried a couple different natural deos: I had a reaction to Tom&#x27;s and Nature&#x27;s Way didn&#x27;t work to save my life. I kind of started thinking that maybe I should go back to the chemical stuff because I talked to some of my friends about my deo issue and they said they had similar experiences... Well, shortly after all of this I decided to become vegan. After being vegan for a short while, I began to hunt down cruelty free products. It was hard to find them in normal stores and I was confused about what brands to trust and stuff so I signed up for a beauty box subscription service called PetitVour. It comes once a month and gives me, usually deluxe, samples of all kind of luxurious vegan goodies. Well, this came in one of the first boxes I received and I&#x27;ve used it ever since. Probably about 4 months now. Never had a reaction and ran out of my sample so I bought the full sized product. Yeah, it&#x27;s a little interesting the first couple times you put it on - but it&#x27;s not as crazy messy as I&#x27;ve heard some reviews claim. AND it&#x27;s actually works! It completely blocks the sweat in the pits and no more stanky-ness half way through the day! I&#x27;m seriously impressed by this product and have no intention of trying anything else (except maybe some of the other scents ;) I&#x27;m a very loyal fan! :D</li>
    <li> It smells good.  It can be tricky to apply.  I still sweat sometimes wearing it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a review writer, but I was really impressed by this deodorant. If you&#x27;re reading this you know either from experience or by reading countless reviews that natural deodorants basically never work or kinda of do but not really. This stuff actually works well. In fact it works better than the regular Dove deodorant I had been using previously. For the most part I don&#x27;t have to reapply it, unless I&#x27;m really active and sweating a lot. Since it comes in a jar you have to use your fingers to apply it (It comes with a little spatula), but I think thats a small price to pay for something that actually works. A lot of people say if you have sensitive skin this might not be for you, and I agree BUT that might be due to people applying it directly after they shave. For about a month I applied it after shaving and by the end of the month I had to stop using it because it really started to sting my skin. After about a week of going back to my regular deodorant my skin felt better, and I decided to give Schmidt&#x27;s another try. This time I made sure to shave at night so I could apply the deodorant in the morning and not after a fresh shave. So far (about a month) this seems to have solved that irritation problem. My experiences have been based on the Bergamot and Lime one, but I plan on trying the others.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using another natural but stick deodorant for the longest time and have been hooked to that as most give me painful underarm breakouts but after reading the great reviews on this I had to try it, and to really give it the test while on vacation in Texas. I can say it stood up in the heat and by the end of the day I had zero smell even into the next day. The scent doesn&#x27;t last, while it&#x27;d be nice if it did the effectiveness of the product more than makes up for it.</li>
    <li> My 5-year search for a natural deodorant that actually works is finally over! I&#x27;ve tried over a dozen different brands and concoctions and had found this mentioned by someone online. I thought this would be like all the other fails: had an awful smell, didn&#x27;t work at all, or stopped working at the hint of perspiration. I have truly put this product through every test imaginable -- those highly stressful work days where your sweat takes on a super-yuk smell; post-super sweaty workout; etc. The result: continued coverage...but not coverage in that your smell is masked by some other smell. Instead, it stops any smell-causing bacteria in its tracks. The travel-friendly factor is also a bonus. On trips, I scoop some into a snack-sized bag, and voile, I am set. I imagine it may take me well over a year to work through just one of the three containers I purchased. Thus, the value coupled with the efficacy makes this product a must-have for any health conscious individual who also likes to smell good.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love the Schmidt&#x27;s deodorants! The scent combinations are unique, and the Bergamot + Lime one that I got is really nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As other reviewers have mentioned, it comes with an applicator stick that you can dish out a bit, then put it on your hand to rub it into your skin. If it is your first time using hand applied deodorants, it might be a bit strange to use at first but I don&#x27;t mind it. It takes a few seconds to warm up the product to your skin, making it easier to rub in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I cannot use this product for too long or it starts to give me a rash. However, I have given it a good rating because I DO NOT blame that on the product itself, but my own armpits. ;) I have had this issue with many, many other natural deodorants on the market (I haven&#x27;t narrowed it down yet but I think there must be some common ingredient that I am just sensitive to in the more natural lines, or just that the underarm skin is more sensitive and absorbent that other areas on your body). I still use this one, but just use it more sporadically (only seem to have issues if I use it daily for a week).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But again, I don&#x27;t blame that on the product per se, because it is a nice, high quality product. The only deodorant I&#x27;ve been able to use consistently without any issues is the Coconut Powder one from Lush (might be worth a go for any of you other folks that have a similar issue with sensitive skin/redness after using natural deodorants).</li>
    <li> I have been using this deodorant for about 9 months now and could not be more pleased. I had tried at least 5 other natural deodorants before I discovered this one. I live in Arizona and this will be my first summer using it and so far no problems in the 110 degree heat. Another bonus since switching s that I actually sweat less than when I was using an antiperspirant. Go figure?!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! Yeah, it&#x27;s not the easiest to apply, but it&#x27;s the most natural deodorant that I&#x27;ve ever used that has kept me smelling good for over 24 hours. It even holds up during the sweatiest of workouts. Now, if that doesn&#x27;t get a 5-star rating for a deodorant, I don&#x27;t know what does!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this deodorant for awhile and I really really like it. Smells fresh and light and holds up well while I teach and even when I work out! One thing I wanted to note is that sometimes switching to a natural deodorant can cause an underarm rash. It happened to me when I switched, but I started doing an &amp;#34;underarm detox&amp;#34; with bentonite clay (there is a great article on the wellness mama blog) and that cleared the itchy rash up and I feel like it helped make my deodorant even more effective! Give it a try before you give up on natural deodorant.</li>
    <li> I have always had a hard time with deodorants. I have been trying to find a Deoderant without harmful chemicals that actually works. I&#x27;ve tried all the store brands and nothing keeps me from smelling or perspiring. Well I finally found it! This natural Deoderant has all healthy ingredients. The application is no bother. It&#x27;s like applying think lotion to my art pits. What I noticed is my arms smell pleasant after an entire day without any repeat application and the wetness is less as well. So I highly recommend this brand. The bergamot lime has a light citrus scent which is fresh and I love. Not too fragrant like dome deodorants. So glad I found this product. I&#x27;m a permanent customer.</li>
    <li> This is the only natural deodorant that has worked for me!  I have spent the last few years trying different kinds/brands and thought I was just going to be &amp;#34;stinky&amp;#34; forever. It is a little inconvenient to have to rub it on with your fingers, but I will gladly do it if it means the deodorant will work.</li>
    <li> Not much to be said about this product, I initially purchased it on another website in the past which cost a lot more where shipping was really ridiculous. It&#x27;s a lot more economical with Amazon prime.&lt;br /&gt;I breast-feed so I don&#x27;t really want to use a commercial deodorant with aerosols. This tempted to track the entire summer even in Miami heat and humidity. The lime oil makes it delicate but it&#x27;s still  powerful enough with the baking soda to do it&#x27;s job in the summer heat.</li>
    <li> I really wanted this product to work for me. Unfortunately, It did nothing to make odor, even on my less strenuous days. Looks like I am back to the good ole crystal.</li>
    <li> Somewhat inconvenient, guess I&#x27;m spoiled with traditional deodorant sticks.  Also it really has no effect on wetness. Thought I would not need so much wetness support but turns out I do not like wet underarms!</li>
    <li> This is a paste that your spread on your skin with your hands. It feels like something you could make yourself with baking soda and essential oil. It&#x27;s a light, citrusy scent.&lt;br /&gt;It works very well for me. However, the baking soda tends to cause minor chafing if I rub it on the non-underarm skin. So don&#x27;t over-do it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the same deodorant in lavender and cedar and really liked the product. I have ordered those again. The lime has given me a rash, stings my skin, and is a different consistency. The jar looked full but it actually just had a layer on top and the rest of the jar was empty. This was a manufacturer error I guess but I would not take the time to return.  8/27 Edit: I ended up throwing this in the trash.  It broke out my skin so bad, I had red, burning, painful skin.  The jar was only half full.  I am using the same product in Lavender and have no problems whatsoever.  Schmidts, what are you putting in this Lime Bergamot one??</li>
    <li> This is my first natural deodorant, and I must say it exceeded my expectations. I&#x27;ve been concerned about aluminum chlorohydrate in antiperspirants, but I am a performer, and spend a fair amount of time after shows greeting audience members and can&#x27;t really afford to go without some sort of protection against undue wetness and body odor. I chose Schmidt&#x27;s from a group of seven other aluminum free products based on the  reviews. The light scent of the product doesn&#x27;t last long, but I didn&#x27;t really want it to, The antiperspirant qualities DO last, Not only are my underarms dry and scent free after the show, they&#x27;re equally well protected for about twenty hours. Yes, one does have to apply the product with one&#x27;s fingers, but if that&#x27;s not an obstacle, I would heartily endorse this deodorant.</li>
    <li> I love the way this smells! It&#x27;s fresh but earthy at the same time. I have had no issues applying it via my fingers, in fact, I like applying deodorant that way! My only issue is that it seems to have irritated my underarms - which has never happened with any other deodorant (natural or not). If you think you might have sensitive pits I&#x27;d choose a different fragrance or go with the unscented one.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of natural deodorants and this is the only one I found that actually works. I kept going back to regular chemical filled deodorants because nothing else worked until I found this stuff. I don&#x27;t have any odor at all in my pits. Love this product.</li>
    <li> This is now my preferred deodorant. All natural, smells great all day,and I know I&#x27;m not putting any unwanted ingredients on my body. Great product!</li>
    <li> finally, an all-natural, non-toxic deodorant that WORKS! This stuff is fabulous. No harmful aluminum either. I can&#x27;t recommend this product enough.</li>
    <li> This is actually the first all-natural deodorant I have ever used, but I bought it based on the great reviews, and they were all correct! The smell seems pretty intense when you open the jar (just like key lime pie, which is my fave dessert but perhaps not what I&#x27;d like to smell like), but the smell disappears by the time you apply it, so it&#x27;s basically just like unscented deodorants in that regard. But man, it works! I&#x27;ve been using it for a week in 90-plus degree weather and have had ZERO issues with wetness or smell. I&#x27;d read reviews of other natural deodorants that said you had to reapply during the day and deal with some wetness, but none of that has happened with this, and I&#x27;m someone who&#x27;s always had to use the &amp;#34;clinical-strength&amp;#34; deodorant/antiperspirants in the past. I LOVE this stuff!</li>
    <li> Love it! :) I stay nice and fresh for most of the day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so grateful for this deodorant. I&#x27;ve been using Clinical Strength Secret for a long time, and feeling awful about how it is harmful to my body, animals, and the earth. I had tried several health food store brands of deodorant that never worked for me. I&#x27;ve been using Schmidts for over 2 weeks without any complaint- it is easy to use (especially when you just get out of a warm shower), and has combatted both wetness and smell for me so far. If I&#x27;m going out again after a long day, I reapply at night. I am so happy to be able to switch to this cleaner, simpler deodorant with ingredients I recognize without any discomfort, embarrassment or remorse. Definitely recommended for a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorant.</li>
    <li> Too hard, doesn&#x27;t go on well. Don&#x27;t really like the smell either.</li>
    <li> As someone who cannot use antiperspirants I am constantly trying to find the perfect product to check perspiration odor.  This is a product that does the job even though  I do not like the gritty consistency and the smell reminds me slightly of bug spray.  I  am developing underarm irritation as well. That is disappointing because now I am once again on the quest to find a product that I can use daily with no problems.  However, I will continue to purchase, but not be able to use it everyday.</li>
    <li> Prior to investing in this item, I researched the reviews of other similar items and the stated effects. This item always seemed to trump the others in it&#x27;s reviews and it was easy to smell why.  I am a busy nurse and had 4 scheduled 12 hr shifts when this product arrived. I was very intimidated, so much so that I brought my &amp;#34;back up&amp;#34; deodorant just in case this one didn&#x27;t work as other had specified it had.  Yes, I applied it with my own fingers...seriously, who cares.  During a couple of busy moments when I could feel the sweat running down my back I thought, &amp;#34;Oh crap! I&#x27;m going to need to grab the back up!, What will my patient think!?, What will my co-workers think!?&amp;#34; Those thoughts were quickly put to rest and when I arrived home at the end of my shift, I didn&#x27;t smell as good as when I&#x27;d went in but there were NO odoriferous imminations emitting from myself. This product lasts as long, possibly a little longer than a regular 4.00 stick of good deodorant but of course is more natural.</li>
    <li> This is not a product I would normally consider using, but I got it in July&#x27;s Petit Vour box and figured I would give it a try. I tend to have pretty sensitive skin under my arms and I *thought* something natural would be easier on me. (For reference, Secret Clinical Strength deodorant gave me a rash that took a week to clear up. But I can use most Dove deodorants.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a pretty hard product. I found it rather difficult to scoop out with my fingers. However, I was eventually successful. When I applied it under my arms, the warmer temperature made it easier to spread. So if you are having a hard time with this, and can figure out a way to warm it up first, that may make it easier to apply. (Maybe soaking the jar in warm water for a few minutes?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should be obvious from my previous paragraph, but in case it isn&#x27;t, this *is* a product you have to use your fingers to apply. I don&#x27;t have a problem with that. I&#x27;ve used deodorants like that before (like the Arrid Extra Dry in a tub). Figured I&#x27;d mention it in case it was distasteful to anyone, though. I think the bergamot-lime scent was pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This had a fairly gritty texture and was a little painful to rub into my skin (I&#x27;d just shaved my underarms; perhaps if you waited a little while you wouldn&#x27;t have the same problem?). It didn&#x27;t leave any obvious (visible) residue. Unfortunately, this isn&#x27;t an anti-perspirant -- it&#x27;s only a deodorant. I still sweated as much as always. Since I live in the South and it&#x27;s the middle of summer, controlling sweat is also important. (As an aside, I had heard you could rub this on your feet to prevent having sweaty feet in your sandals. Unfortunately, this did not work for me when I tried it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, after I&#x27;d had this on for maybe 8 hours, I noticed my armpits were reddened. So I think I am having some kind of reaction to this product. (My skin there is more sensitive than in other areas. The bottoms of my feet did not have the same reaction.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, this product is probably not for everyone. If you have sensitive skin under your arms, I would avoid this. If you sweat a lot or live in a hot area, I would probably also avoid this. If you live in a cooler climate and/or have some reason to avoid chemical deodorants/antiperspirants, you may want to give this a try. Because of the reaction I had, this product is not going to work for me. Wish I could think of another use for it, though, because it does smell good.ion.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, this product is probably not for everyone.

    <li> I bought this at a local Natural Grocery market in town because I didn&#x27;t like the way the crystals I had been using worked against smell--I don&#x27;t shave my pits very often and need something a bit stronger.&lt;br /&gt;The plastic spoon was helpful in digging out, but the actual rolling on left my hands greasy. Which would have been okay....&lt;br /&gt;But I have super extra sensitive skin (such a freaking blessing HAHAHA) and this caused me to break out in a continuous thick rash, which I originally attributed to a purse strap as it was in the crease of my armpit.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately tossing this.</li>
    <li> My skin is too sensitive for it. its currently making my armpits itch and the scent is too sour.(actually smells like bad odor to me) still using it though until it runs out. it holds well throughout the day</li>
    <li> A natural deodorant that works!</li>
    <li> Would be much better in stick form, very messy to apply.</li>
    <li> I really the fragrance and effectiveness of this product, but the texture is too dry to evenly apply.  Adding a dollop of coconut oil fixed it up.  Coconut oil makes everything better.</li>
    <li> I love the way this deodorant smelled, but it gave me an awful skin rash. Both of my underarms became discolored with large lumps. It happened after about 3 weeks of use. I switched, and the rash went away.</li>
    <li> Very unusual. It will take a bit getting used to applying deodorant like this but once you do, it&#x27;s glorious.</li>
    <li> It works well.  I wore it and bought one for my husband.  You have to scoop some out and put it on your fingers to rub it in, but it&#x27;s pleasant.</li>
    <li> If I would have known natural deodorant could be this good, I would have made the switch long ago. In fact, this actually works BETTER for me than the drugstore aluminum varieties. I was super skeptical at first but I&#x27;m so glad I made the leap. And seriously people, using your fingers to apply deodorant is not a big deal! We use our fingers to apply moisturizers to our face, this is simply just one more step. So what, you have to wash your hands after you apply it. No big deal. And plus, the spatula it comes with makes it easy and feels much more sanitary, if you will, than sticking your fingers in there every time. I&#x27;ve only used the bergamot lime scent and it is lovely. Very fresh, absolutely perfect for summer. I run every morning and then work outdoors in the heat as a mail carrier. I get sweaty, bottom line. I don&#x27;t smell though, and to me that&#x27;s perfect. Give it a try! I know I&#x27;ll never go back to aluminum deodorant as long as they make this.</li>
    <li> When I used the recommended amount, I had to reapply every 2-3 hours. When I used more than the recommended amount, it burned my armpits. The Bergamot + Lime scent is not as strong as the Lavendar + Sage scent. It&#x27;s also smells more sweetly than I&#x27;d like. Try ZAK&#x27;s or Green Tidings&#x27; all-natural deodorant. ZAK is my favorite but they both kept me MUCH dryer and fresher than Schmidt&#x27;s and for much longer.</li>
    <li> It smells good but it only lasts about 4 hours or so</li>
    <li> love love love this. the stink is gone! I am not a big underarm sweater-er, so this stuff also keeps me very dry. I have to be doing a hard, hard work out in order for sweat to appear in the undearms, but even then, no stink! I use this product in tandem with Pit Powder. As for people &amp;#34;ewwwing&amp;#34; out over having to apply with fingers.....for me, this is no big deal. If you have just showered, this is truly no big deal. If you put on lotion on other parts of your body, this is really  no different. You use the tieniest amount (a pea size or less) and then really rub it in (not hard, but blend well into skin).  Using your fingers is the only way to get this product to blend into your skin. Then, I just wash my hands afterwards and everything is good to go. Really, it&#x27;s no big deal.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, smells great, and no irritation~lost a long time too!</li>
    <li> My hottie Oakland cousin introduced me to Schmidt&#x27;s a year ago and I&#x27;ve never gone back!!!!! Also love the sandalwood juniper.  If I had a blog or FB page I&#x27;d like and link FO SHO.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this, but I just don&#x27;t. For one it is super expensive and the jar is tiny. Two, if you choose to buy this only do so during cooler months. When it arrived it had melted which I think changed the texture. It&#x27;s very grainy. Three, it discolored my pits. First they turned red, then to brown. Not attractive at all. I stopped using this for a few days and the normal color returned. Tried this stuff again and they went red again. I love the smell so I was really excited, but overall I am disappointed and will try to return it.</li>
    <li> Works really well at covering up B.O. But I&#x27;m not crazy about applying it with my fingers. It&#x27;s worth it though.</li>
    <li> Love this product. The only &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; product that keeps me smelling fresh. My only complaint is the price, wish it was cheaper</li>
    <li> I have tried several aluminum free deodorant options over the past few years and this is the only one that works. I live in southwest Florida and am often outside in the heat. This stuff keeps me stink free all day. When I first started using it i got some itchy red bumps like others have described however they have gone away as I have continued to use the product. I have recommended it to many of my friends who are also impressed and we have all continued to purchase Schmidt&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Nice scent and does the trick for avoiding the stank.</li>
    <li> Regular name brand deodorants do not work for me.  They all have varying degrees of the same ingredients that don&#x27;t sound especially safe.  I began the search for a safe all natural deodorant that was effective.  I&#x27;ve tried at least 10 different brands, including Tom&#x27;s and Kiss My Face.  Schmidt&#x27;s out protects them all.  A really great product.  It was an adjustment getting used to applying with my fingertips, but that&#x27;s not a big deal at all.&lt;br /&gt;The only two drawbacks for me are that it can sometimes be a little crumbly when trying to get it out of the jar, and sometimes stings a little.  It comes with a tiny flat spatula to help get it out of the jar, and maybe that could use a little curve.  It will just kind of crumble off the spatula sometimes.  After shaving, it can definitely cause a little sting.  I think that is because of the baking soda.  I&#x27;ve seen other reviews that mention skin darkening.  I&#x27;ve been using this for almost a year and have not experienced that.</li>
    <li> Wife loves it!  Does the job without harsh chemicals.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this product and absolutely loves it.</li>
    <li> Surprisingly non problematic to apply. Amazing fragrance. Lasts all day. Best deoderant I have ever tried.</li>
    <li> The ONLY natural deodorant the works, and yes Ive tried them all.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this - I hate putting the commercial chemical stuff with all that aluminum on my body. This stuff is easy to apply, and it really has little smell of its own - it is so muted you will not smell the bergamot or lime. It seemed to work really well at reducing body odor, even when sweating pretty heavily. But after a couple of weeks it made my armpits itch and break out in a rash. I stopped using it and the rash went away, and I tried using another of the flavors. That one caused the rash again. This stuff is not cheap, and now I am going to have to throw this stuff away.</li>
    <li> Awwwww...I&#x27;m so bummed about this product.  It smells fantastic, but I broke out in a rash.  My husband tried to use it as well, and he broke out in a rash too.  Guess our skin types just weren&#x27;t compatible.  But I do have to say for those who it is compatible with, you will LOVE how the Bergamot + Lime smells!</li>
    <li> FINALLY something that works for me.  I feel like I&#x27;ve been doing it wrong for 20 years of my life.  I&#x27;ve tried everything: natural crystal deodorant, Dove, Secret, Degree, Speed Stick, Tom&#x27;s of Maine, clinical strength stuff, the list goes on.  I&#x27;ve always ended up smelling terrible no matter what, and suspected that my body chemistry mixed with whatever chemicals were in these deodorants caused me to smell worse than nothing at all.  Also most of those deodorants would make my clothes smell bad, like sweaters and blazers, so I&#x27;ve spent a fortune on dry cleaning too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My best friend and I were traveling together and she had a jar of this Schmidt&#x27;s Natural Deodorant and suggested I try it.  She showed me how to scoop it out of the jar and roll the product into a pea-sized ball, then spread it on my armpits.  It smelled delectable!!  (You will have to wash your hands after applying, but trust me, it&#x27;s worth it.)  I was super skeptical at first.  Every couple of hours I&#x27;d check my own stink status, and continued to be pleasantly surprised by the total lack of smell!  By the end of the day I simply smelled like nothing!  No smell at all.  I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 months now and have zero complaints.  And I just converted my sister to a Schmidt&#x27;s believer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BONUS: I love that I don&#x27;t have to worry about breast-cancer causing chemicals with this either.</li>
    <li> Best natural deodorant I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried all the crystal deodorants (none worked for me), kiss my face roll-on, tom&#x27;s, Jason, herbal clear, e plus high c, and herbal magic. Before I found schmidts I had stuck with herbal magic which was okay for one day, but you were out of luck if you wanted to re-apply on a second day. I love that I can re-apply schmidts, and it will keep working! The application is a little annoying, but it&#x27;s better than waiting for a roll-on to dry.</li>
    <li> I love it!! I end up using a little more than a pea size in order to get full 8-12 hour anti-stink coverage. Instead of rolling between my fingers, I just press between them until it melts and then evenly distribute the melted &amp;#34;paste&amp;#34; onto each armpit. I love the refreshing scent, but it&#x27;s light and not overwhelming or barely even whelming. Zero irritation!! I had switched to this product after using the natural arm and hammer deoderant for years and developing a sudden allergy to it (rash, itch, discoloration). This product gives me none of those symptoms! Can&#x27;t wait to try the other scents!</li>
    <li> too hard to get out of the jar..otherwise nice to be free of aluminum</li>
    <li> This is  my fault I didnt read the ingredients and realized that I was allergic to some of the  ingredients.  I spent the afternoon flapping my arms like a chicken until they itching and burning stopped.  Read the ingredients to be sure you wont have a reaction.</li>
    <li> This product will prevent you from sweating, and smells like a margarita.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside is it will most likely give you serious irritation because of the concentrated amounts of baking soda. A large amount of natural deodorants on the market do this, and cause skin discoloration/rash like symptoms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*If this happens to you I suggest EO Organic Deodorant Spray, and to check out the App SkinDeep!</li>
