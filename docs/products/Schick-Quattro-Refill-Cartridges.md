      <li>Gives a better shave &amp; lasts longer.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t fit my Schick Quattro razor!</li>
      <li>The regular Men&#x27;s Shick Quattro blades are the perfect compromise for both my husband and I.</li>
      <li>They fit the Quattro correctly and they shave nicely.</li>
      <li>For the price, you can&#x27;t get any better.</li>

      <li>Price seemed fair for the product, but doubling the shipping and handling cost was a bit much.</li>
      <li>They are worth the 15% more cost for the 3000% better product.</li>

      <li>It would be super if these weren&#x27;t LITERALLY, the most overpriced thing I can find in the world.</li>
      <li>The ad said the Hydro handle will fit this cartridge.</li>

      <li>I find that the men&#x27;s blades seem to last longer than the women&#x27;s but work just great for your legs and won&#x27;t cut you even at the oddest angles.  </li>
      <li>These are designed to fit the Schick Quattro razor and are a pefect match for the origial blades.</li>
      <li>They fit my razor.</li>

      <li>These blades are fantastic.</li>
      <li>The shave is smooth and clean.  </li>
      <li>Very fast shipping and transaction went smoothly with no problems!</li>
      <li>Glad they stay consistent on their design</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m never disappointed with the quality of a shave using this product.</li>
      <li>Overall they appear to be good blades.</li>
      <li>Razors are ridiculously overpriced, but this is the best bang for the buck you can find on the internet.</li>
      <li>It arrived quickly and well-packaged.</li>
      <li>possibly not brand name but work very well and great price</li>
      <li>In the future, I hope to buy more from you!</li>
      <li>very smooth shave.great for sensitive</li>
      <li>A nice close shave and cartridges that last for a couple weeks of shaving.</li>
      <li>Very good, long lasting blades</li>
      <li>finding the right price is the challenge.</li>
      <li>So for a little more the titanium blades are better value.</li>
      <li>The reason I&#x27;ve stayed with Quattro despite it getting harder and harder to find replacement razors is because of this excellent record.  </li>
      <li>I caution the women not to get the Titanium version of the Quattro though only because there is also an edging blade which is great for men I supposed but not for women who need to be cautious of an extra blade on the side (no protective wires either) as you are manuvering around to shave your legs.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>They fit the old Quattro without a problem</li>
      <li>Also, they last more than a week.</li>
      <li>- Thanks!</li>
      <li>Exactly the razors I needed.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m ready to order a refill right now.</li>

      <li>Fast service.</li>
      <li>Thanks for an inexpensive razor refill.</li>
      <li>As advertised, fast delivery</li>
      <li>After shaving with it, I noticed the difference a much cleaner shave.</li>
      <li>: I really thought it was me.  </li>
      <li>I reordered these because the original ones I ordered (see above) were lost in three feet of snow.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used the other brand for many years.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy, not much to report, they seem to be just what I needed for less than a set of four at the drug store.</li>
      <li>These blades cost to much and they don&#x27;t quite live up to the publicity that it has received.</li>
      <li>This cartridge fits an older handle for the Edge razor by Schick.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Was as advertised and came on time</li>
    <li> just a basic blade that fits on my 5 yo razor.  Glad they stay consistent on their design</li>
    <li> I reordered these because the original ones I ordered (see above) were lost in three feet of snow.  Must of been plowed away.  No sign of them.</li>
    <li> Whenever I try to switch razors I always end up going back to these.  I&#x27;ve tried a couple of different Gillette handles and blades and always end up cutting myself.  Sometimes badly.  I never have this issue with the Shick Quattro.</li>
    <li> Great Shave! Competitive Price! - This system is the best in my opinion. Quattro is my choice for shaving so finding the right price is the challenge. This was a good price for an excellent product. - Thanks!</li>
    <li> Great product. Great prices. Great service.</li>
    <li> Product (razors) shipped as expected.  Very fast shipping and transaction went smoothly with no problems!</li>
    <li> I give these razor blades every year to the guys in my family for their xmas stockings.  They love receiving and using them and the price is good also.</li>
    <li> I purchased the 8 pack of these for around $12, which is alot cheaper then the store. The Quattro is kind of old school but works great. I don&#x27;t walk around with cuts on my face, which is a plus. Razors are ridiculously overpriced, but this is the best bang for the buck you can find on the internet.</li>
    <li> I got a nice close shave .</li>
    <li> possibly not brand name but work very well and great price</li>
    <li> The Schick Quattro brand is my favorite. They are the best for my skin. I&#x27;m ready to order a refill right now.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for years and I am very pleased with the results.    Portion of my beard is very tough and this razor just moves smoothly and closely to remove these hairs in one pass.    I nearly never get nicked and when I do, I have been distracted.    Buy it and enjoy (I do not work for Schick)</li>
    <li> Fast service. Great price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these blades since high school and I still have silky smooth skin, at least for a couple of hours. The only beef I&#x27;ve had with these blades over the years is the green rubber thing often melts in high temps and comes off when I have to rub the blades to get the more rightous hairs our the blade so I can continue shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By that I mean, if I keep a goatee for a month then decide to shave it, the longer course-er hairs will not wash out with water, I usually have to remove them manually.</li>
    <li> The cartridges were good, the delivery was fine, the price was excellent. Thanks</li>
    <li> Very good price! Plus, the blades are great!</li>
    <li> A nice close shave and cartridges that last for a couple weeks of shaving. And less expensive than the other brands. Not even Walmart was carrying them anymore I was very happy to find them on Amazon at a good price.</li>
    <li> After using this product for over a month, I had occasion today to ask my wife if perhaps this product was counterfeit.  Nope: we examined the box, and all seemed well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never had a problem with Quattro razors, EVER.  That is, until this order.  I never had a razor cut, never had razor bumps -- and I use the best shave cream available.  The reason I&#x27;ve stayed with Quattro despite it getting harder and harder to find replacement razors is because of this excellent record.  But now, I nearly need a styptic pencil as in the days of old.  I have no way to explain this dramatic difference in quality, but it most certainly is present in the shipment I got.  And yes, I change the razor once a week.  Which is why it took me a while to submit this evaluation: I really thought it was me.  Well, it&#x27;s not.  It&#x27;s the poor quality of this razor.</li>
    <li> Exactly the razors I needed. I usually buy them at the local supermarket but they charge a small fortune for them. These are a good price.</li>
    <li> My father was a great fan of Wilkinson Sword in the UK.  Following in his footsteps, I see the quality and value in the Schick brand.&lt;br /&gt;These blades are not easy to find in my local stores.  In the future, I hope to buy more from you!</li>
    <li> If you have this razor,you should skip this blade &amp; buy the Titanium blade.Gives a better shave &amp; lasts longer.</li>
    <li> A great price for a great blade. I&#x27;ve used the other brand for many years. I have no complaints about them, but the Schick blades offer a better shave and last longer in addition to costing less per blade.  I&#x27;m a convert.</li>
    <li> These are designed to fit the Schick Quattro razor and are a pefect match for the origial blades. Eight refills for this price will keep me clean shaven for at least a year. Great price. Fast transaction. I am one happy camper :)</li>
    <li> I like these blades.  The shave is smooth and clean.  They fit my razor. That&#x27;s mostly what I look for in a blade or cartridge.</li>
    <li> AAA quality Nd prompt shipping</li>
    <li> They are working just fine.  They fit the old Quattro without a problem</li>
    <li> Two problems with the Schick Quattro blade-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It gives you so many nicks you&#x27;ll have to put a gigantic bandage over the entire area you just shaved or around 10 little pieces of toilet paper - even if you just broke out a new cartridge&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The blades clog so completely with hair after the first stroke that you have to use your finger to wipe down with the blade direction (against it would cut your finger, obviously) to unclog it after every stroke or two, depending on how thick you are&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you dont want this problem, get a double-edged safety razor by Merkur. They are easy as pie to unclog and hardly make you bleed at all compared to multi-blade razors.</li>
    <li> Not as good as the Schick Hydro 5-blade item. The ad said the Hydro handle will fit this cartridge. It did not. Had to buy a Quattro handle.</li>
    <li> need to buy more ... good deal for these.</li>
    <li> No razor compairs to these. The closest easiest shave possible. Hands down.</li>
    <li> These are the only blades my husband wants to use.</li>
    <li> In the stores these Schick Quattro Refill Cartridges are very expensive. The razor itself is very Inexpensive, compared to the Refills. My husband loves a bargain. Thanks for an inexpensive razor refill.</li>
    <li> As advertised, fast delivery</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a commodity .. nothing to say about the product. It arrived quickly and well-packaged. But it doesn&#x27;t take twice the effort (or cost twice as much) to put 2 8-packs in an envelope as it does to ship a single package. Price seemed fair for the product, but doubling the shipping and handling cost was a bit much.</li>
    <li> These razors gave me a clean shave and kept sharp for an extended time-frame. These are worth the cost and last longer than all the other generic or fewer blade models. You wont be disappointed with these razor refills.</li>
    <li> They fit the Quattro correctly and they shave nicely. Overall they appear to be good blades. I was disappointed that they did not have the single blade on the back for things like sideburns that the original had, but I expected that from the photos.</li>
    <li> I switched to the men&#x27;s refills because they are cheaper than the women&#x27;s refills. These razor refills are identical to the women&#x27;s and work just as well.</li>
    <li> the product is good but the seller substituted this item for a better upgraded blades which I ordered. So for a little more the titanium blades are better value.</li>
    <li> I thought that this product had a trim blade. Not satisfied at ALL.</li>
    <li> They showed up ... they shave.</li>
    <li> Great product and price</li>
    <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t get any better.</li>
    <li> Great product, nice to be able to pay a fair price compared to what retail stores are selling them at.  Local store that always carried them have stopped because of the latest and greatest (as far as they are concerned).  Nice to be able to stay with what has always worked for me.</li>
    <li> My wife likes that I no longer give her splinters with my face.</li>
    <li> I have four problems with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A) Product quality:&lt;br /&gt;My previous handle came apart after 24 shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;B) Usability:&lt;br /&gt;The handles are entirely different shape and contour between models.&lt;br /&gt;Many do not come with a tray to hold extra blades.&lt;br /&gt;Many do not fit in existing trays to hold extra blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;C) Customer Service:&lt;br /&gt;I reported the problem to Shick, which is \\&quot;Energizer Personal Care\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;2 weeks later, they responded with apology, and committment to send me a coupon to replace the handle.&lt;br /&gt;5 weeks after that email, I received the coupon in the mail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;D) The blades clog.  If I have stubble only, then the shaving goo and stubble bits pack into the razor.  It can&#x27;t be rinsed out except maybe by a pressure-washer.  If I have a couple of week&#x27;s worth of growth, the hairs all get stuck in the safety wires they put over the blades to keep them from cutting you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product shows a lack of usability study, poor customer service, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go back to Gillette.  They are worth the 15% more cost for the 3000% better product.</li>
    <li> very smooth shave.great for sensitive skin.does not nick or cut when you start a new blade.lasts a decent amount of time.</li>
    <li> I have been buying these for my husband for a while now and he really likes this brand and the close shave they give him. Also, they last more than a week. I&#x27;m not sure how long he uses a blade for but he has mentioned that they last. Lol.</li>
    <li> I love these razors. I started with the Shick Silk Effects years ago which worked great on my legs in the shower and its was almost next to impossible to cut yourself due to the wires over the blades. I have since tried the triple blade and now we have the Quattro.  I find that the men&#x27;s blades seem to last longer than the women&#x27;s but work just great for your legs and won&#x27;t cut you even at the oddest angles.  I would recommend these to anyone.  I caution the women not to get the Titanium version of the Quattro though only because there is also an edging blade which is great for men I supposed but not for women who need to be cautious of an extra blade on the side (no protective wires either) as you are manuvering around to shave your legs. The regular Men&#x27;s Shick Quattro blades are the perfect compromise for both my husband and I.</li>
    <li> These blades are fantastic. They have everything that Gillette Fusion has, but at a lower price. So far, my Schick Quattro Titanium blades are lasting nearly twice as long as my experience with the Gillette Fusion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m never disappointed with the quality of a shave using this product. I like the small lotion bar on the cartridge.</li>
    <li> They work great- and they last so long- And best of all, they do not cut up my face- Jim</li>
    <li> Timely shipping and product as described. Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> These work fine for the price and they fit my schick quattro shaver and trimmer. I&#x27;m happy, not much to report, they seem to be just what I needed for less than a set of four at the drug store.</li>
    <li> Very good, long lasting blades</li>
    <li> Less money than I could ever get them for in the store. They should last my husband a long time.</li>
    <li> These blades cost to much and they don&#x27;t quite live up to the publicity that it has received.I have always been and will continue to use Schick.</li>
    <li> Cannot find these refill blades much anymore. So glad you carry them.&lt;br /&gt;My husband loves the razor so we need to keep getting the refills.</li>
    <li> They charge the same price for half the blades in the stores (Giant Eagle, Walmart, Rite Aide) When you can find them. .  Great way to save money.</li>
    <li> This cartridge fits an older handle for the Edge razor by Schick. This is fortunate so finding another more expensive razor isn&#x27;t necessary.</li>
    <li> Just disappointed that these aren&#x27;t really original Schick, but an imitation. But it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> It would be super if these weren&#x27;t LITERALLY, the most overpriced thing I can find in the world.</li>
    <li> These went dull really quickly.</li>
    <li> Quattro carridges work great</li>
    <li> All dealings with Amazon have been Amazazing.  No problems.</li>

    <li> I was using cheap disposable razors for many years. I received a Schick  Quattro razor as a gift. After shaving with it, I noticed the difference a much cleaner shave. I gave what I had left of the disposable razors to my wife. Which made both of us happy her with a dozen razors and me no longer with a shadow shave.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t fit my Schick Quattro razor!</li>
