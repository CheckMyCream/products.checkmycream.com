      <li>I thought this product did a good job overall but have found Jason&#x27;s citrus body wash to be more appealing to me than the Aloe Vera version.  </li>

      <li>I have sensitive skin and have tried many of the major brands of body wash that are supposed to be mild.  </li>
      <li>However, after my first use, I have to say that it did not lather very well.</li>
      <li>I have been using it ever since and will continue to buy it, as a part of careful skin care, to eliminate most flare-ups.</li>
      <li>It foams up really well without using one of those scratchy puff things.</li>
      <li>I first purchased this last summer after I had my very first Psoriasis outbreak.</li>
      <li>We both use it daily and love it, it does not dry out your skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s quite gentle, but cleans well and leaves the skin very soft.  </li>
      <li>For $10, the bottle lasts for a long time, so it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
      <li>while it is all-natural, has a very mild scent, and does make me feel clean if I use enough, it will turn out to be about 3x what I normally pay for body wash since I use roughly the same amount and the price is quite a bit higher than what I normally pay.</li>
      <li>No complaint about the product.</li>
      <li>A nice subtle scent and a very soft body wash.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>My husband has a problem with acne on his back, but this really solved the problem!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 6&#x27;5\\&quot; and I only need one pump of it to do the whole job!</li>
      <li>The pump dispenser was broken at the top and the top was not screwed on tight</li>
      <li>- Leaves skin soft  </li>
      <li>- Natural ingredients</li>
      <li>However the packaging left much room for improvement.</li>
      <li>I am bathing my 4-year old with this soap also.</li>
      <li>Bought it for 25 year old daughter</li>
      <li>The product ships nicely from Amazon; we&#x27;ve never experienced a leaky bottle.  </li>
      <li>I bought that because the reviews, but I didn&#x27;t like it, smells funny, not good perfume, you don&#x27;t feel clean.</li>
      <li>But the big plus is, it&#x27;s all natural.  </li>
      <li>Fortunately the bottle was in a plastic bag (apparently they have had similar issues in the past).  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m looking forward to trying out new combinations as I have a big collection of essential oils.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s easy to use in when you&#x27;re pre-caffeininated and half brain dead.  </li>
      <li>Almost everything I used would irrirate my outbreaks and with it being mainly on my hands, I had to be careful!</li>
      <li>Both my husband and I have dry, sensitive skin.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> this is a great product.  I use it as a hand wash</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and have tried many of the major brands of body wash that are supposed to be mild.  Most of those on the market either don&#x27;t seem like they are getting you clean, or leave a residue that makes me break out.  This stuff makes my skin feel clean and comfortable and doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent.  The scent it does have only lasts till I get out of the shower and doesn&#x27;t leave you smelling like perfume. It never gives my skin that tight feeling, and my skin feels soft without being oily. It foams up really well without using one of those scratchy puff things. I think this is where the satin comes from in the name because the lather feels so smooth.  Best of all it lasts a long time! I bought the 30oz. Size in August and I just ran out at the end of January!  I shower at least once a day and sometimes twice. I&#x27;m 6&#x27;5\\&quot; and I only need one pump of it to do the whole job!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive/dry skin, and have tried a lot of different body washes; this is my favorite.    - Smells nice, not too strong  - Lathers well  - Leaves skin soft  - Lasts a long time (a little goes a long way)  - Natural ingredients</li>
    <li> I love this body wash. It doesnt have any crazy chemicals and after a week of use my skin felt smoother. Bought it for 25 year old daughter and she agrees. Try it, you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
    <li> I like this body wash. It makes my skin feel soft and smooth. But the big plus is, it&#x27;s all natural.  The smell isn&#x27;t strong, but it&#x27;s nice, and it lathers up really well....I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> In the past I&#x27;ve purchased a ton of LUSH beauty products because they make them with lots of essential oils. What I&#x27;ve realized is that I can make some scented liquid soaps myself by using essential oils and this Jason&#x27;s Body Wash. Simply put a combination of oils in a small plastic bottle and add in some body wash. Shake and use. Some of my favorite combinations are sweet orange, neroli and rose. I&#x27;ve also tried Ylang Ylang, Patchouli, Lotus and Sandalwood. I&#x27;m looking forward to trying out new combinations as I have a big collection of essential oils. I also like Balsam Fir Needle which is refreshing. I find the body wash works well with a body brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
    <li> Body wash.  With aloe.  It does what you think it does.</li>
    <li> huge! this will last us a long time and its an awesome deal.... definitely worth purchasing! the scent is really nice and i love natural products. makes me feel so much better to reduce the amount of chemicals i come in contact with, especially since i am pregnant.</li>
    <li> I love this body wash as it leaves my skin hydrated. The price is fair as it lasts me for many months. My favorite is the Aloe Vera, but I like the Tea Tree Oil and mango ones too.</li>
    <li> I thought this product did a good job overall but have found Jason&#x27;s citrus body wash to be more appealing to me than the Aloe Vera version.  Would recommend Jason&#x27;s overall just not fond of this one.</li>
    <li> Nice gender neutral smell.  My husband and I love the Jason body wash, and we appreciate that it is a much better option for our septic system than most.  The large bottle and pump are a great value for the price.  The product ships nicely from Amazon; we&#x27;ve never experienced a leaky bottle.  The price is much better than in our local stores.</li>
    <li> My whole family has gone through a health change for the better. I started doing research for hair and body products and this is one of the best body washes. The ingredients are amazing. My whole family loves it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product and the Jason Chamomile Body Wash for about 4 years and I can&#x27;t use anything else.  It&#x27;s quite gentle, but cleans well and leaves the skin very soft.  I love most Jason Natural products, but this one I can&#x27;t do without.  For $10, the bottle lasts for a long time, so it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> I like this soap a lot. I purchased the Tea Tree soap because I thought it smelled the best of all the others. It doesn&#x27;t smell like tea tree oil. It smells light and herbal/powdery. It certainly is not a lingering smell. I have not experienced dryness yet. I am bathing my 4-year old with this soap also. Basically, so far so good. I definitely will use this soap again.</li>
    <li> THIS ITEM IS JUST OKAY WILL NEVER PURCHASE AGAIN ALSO TOO EXPENSIVE</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve used this body soap for years and love it.</li>
    <li> I use this for many years, just love it and is so natural. I can only recommend this product .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this brand for years as a good quality body wash that didn&#x27;t have all the carcinogenic chemicals that other products have. Recently they&#x27;ve started to add in questionable ingredients that are not in-line with heath conscience individuals such as myself yet they are still charging the same price. I don&#x27;t pay extra to get the same crap everyone else sells. I&#x27;m finished with Jason and going to find something better.</li>
    <li> My grandson was visiting recently, he has such bad eczema, I was desperate!! I had this soap for awhile, and thought&lt;br /&gt;it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try. I&#x27;m so glad I did, he wasn&#x27;t scratching/itching or crying( he&#x27;s 18 months). I was DESPERATE, to&lt;br /&gt;get him some relief, I can&#x27;t say enough GOOD things about this soap. Except left no residue, no itching afterwards and&lt;br /&gt;the biggest reward: he slept through the night! God bless your soap! I will DEFINITELY be reordering!</li>
    <li> This is so great for dry skin, just makes you feel smooth and clean.</li>
    <li> No complaint about the product. However the packaging left much room for improvement. The pump dispenser was broken at the top and the top was not screwed on tight so the lotion was coming out of the bottle. Fortunately the bottle was in a plastic bag (apparently they have had similar issues in the past).  Too messy to bother returning.</li>
    <li> The perfume smell is overpowering.</li>
    <li> Our doctor recommended this when I was diagnosed with eczema 10 years ago. I have been using it ever since and will continue to buy it, as a part of careful skin care, to eliminate most flare-ups.</li>
    <li> This seems to be a very nice body wash.  The pump was chipped  when it arrived but replaced it with another pump I had,</li>
    <li> Awesome body wash. Leaves my skin feeling smooth and moist.</li>
    <li> My husband has a problem with acne on his back, but this really solved the problem!  It does not smell to girly.  We both use it daily and love it, it does not dry out your skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this awhile back and just started using it today.  Others said that the scent was mild, but I found it to be overwhelming.  It smelled like funeral flowers - and I still smelled like funeral flowers even after my shower.  I do not like it and will probably throw the rest away.</li>
    <li> After reading all the reviews here, I bought and eagerly awaited this product, as I am trying to reduce the amount of chemicals I use on my skin and body. I do like that it doesn&#x27;t have phthalates or sulfates. However, after my first use, I have to say that it did not lather very well. I had read the other reviews that stated only a small amount went a long way and I did not find that to be true. Only if I use the same amount as any other body wash (about 2 squirts) do I get any lather or feel clean.&lt;br /&gt;So while it is all-natural, has a very mild scent, and does make me feel clean if I use enough, it will turn out to be about 3x what I normally pay for body wash since I use roughly the same amount and the price is quite a bit higher than what I normally pay.</li>
    <li> Both my husband and I have dry, sensitive skin.  This body wash does not dry out our skin like other washes, even those that claim to be &#x27;moisturizing&#x27;.  It lathers up nicely, a little goes a long way.  I love the pump bottle in the shower, it&#x27;s easy to use in when you&#x27;re pre-caffeininated and half brain dead.  The scent is gender neutral, mild and fresh, not at all overpowering.  I&#x27;ve tried the other body wash scents in this line and this is the one we both agree on.</li>
    <li> I bought that because the reviews, but I didn&#x27;t like it, smells funny, not good perfume, you don&#x27;t feel clean.</li>
    <li> This is great for sensitive skin and is my face wash, body wash and sometimes I use it as shampoo in a pinch. It&#x27;s gentle, smells great and lasts for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this soap and buy it also in Rose or Citrus sometimes, but aloe is my favorite. Highly recommend for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> No nonsense, fragrant but not a super froufrou scent. Solid pump, dispenses perfect amount of product. Terribly reusable container (thankfully, since the pump is significant.)</li>
    <li> I first purchased this last summer after I had my very first Psoriasis outbreak. Almost everything I used would irrirate my outbreaks and with it being mainly on my hands, I had to be careful! Jason&#x27;s Aloe Vera wash has been perfect! A nice subtle scent and a very soft body wash. I also use the Jason Aloe Vera shampoo and conditioner and love them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rated 4 stars as we are a Navy family over seas, and sadly Jason only ships to the States, so we have to send it to my in-laws and have them mail it to us, resulting in a delayed shipment of the product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this stuff, she does.  And she swears by it.</li>
