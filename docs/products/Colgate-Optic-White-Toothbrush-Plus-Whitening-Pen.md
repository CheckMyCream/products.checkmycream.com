      <li>easy to use with good results; haven&#x27;t used the brush yet but the whitening pen is easier to use than I thought it would be</li>
      <li>This is a remarkably easy and effective product.  </li>
      <li>used to whiten my teeth at the dentist office, tried whitening stripes, etc., and find this pen as the most effective, painless and easy to use method.</li>
      <li>I have gotten a better hang of it.  </li>
      <li>I use 4 clicks for top and 4 clicks for bottoms (more than the recommended 2 and 2).  </li>
      <li>It also says that this product is enamel safe.  </li>
      <li>and I would purchase more.</li>
      <li>my favorite part is how the pen goes into the toothbrush two for one deal.</li>
      <li>I love the whitening pen and wish they were sold separately.</li>
      <li>I found this product works better for me than the optic whitening trays.</li>
      <li>Love this and will be ordering one for my husband.</li>
      <li>The now you use it, the more it works.  </li>
      <li>Make sure you read the label since you are not suppose to use water to clean the tip of the whitening pen!</li>
      <li>I was good about using the gel the first couple of weeks, but despite it saying you should continue to use it</li>

      <li>Quick shipment and nice seller.  </li>
      <li>The brilliant optic toothpaste works much better, especially if you use it with an electric toothbrush.</li>
      <li>The pen is easy to use...</li>
      <li>After one week I see a huge difference.  </li>
      <li>One huge downside- you have to buy the set, and can&#x27;t just buy whitening pen refills when you run out.</li>
      <li>great expect it doesn&#x27;t seem sanitary after you use the whitening stick and then put it back into the toothbrush.</li>
      <li>so I have to conclude there was some improvement--but not as much as I would have liked.</li>
      <li>Have already used this before, bought at a Local Superstore, good value for money and truly satisfied with the results.</li>
      <li>I love the convenience of the whither being right in the brush.  </li>
      <li>I like the toothbrush with the rubber pads that I think help clean the teeth.  </li>
      <li>sometimes it does not stick that great if you have really wet teeth.</li>
      <li>Pleased with this product and soooo much cheaper than dentist or the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; whitener.</li>
      <li>Not a bad concept</li>
      <li>, I haven&#x27;t been very consistent.</li>
      <li>Plus, you don&#x27;t need to take an hour (or more) in your daily schedule to work on perfecting your smile :)</li>
      <li>I ordered about 2 weeks before important event to whiten my smile because I laugh and smile a lot.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good option if you just need to whiten a little bit or take care of some spots, but it&#x27;s not going to get them bright white.</li>
      <li>After a week I did notice a distinct difference</li>
      <li>I do think it is worth it.  </li>
      <li>I bought this for the whitening agent which was cleverly packaged and promotes convenience and easy application.</li>
      <li>The brush is just right, and the pen will whiten if you use as directed.</li>
      <li>Very easy to use, and I only apply it once a day for 3 days now</li>
      <li>because there.wasn&#x27;t enough in the pen to use more.</li>
      <li>I like I noticed a difference just after the first use.</li>
      <li>I did it consistently and followed the direction step by step, but after 2 weeks still no result.</li>
      <li>I also use the optic white toothpaste too which I love.  </li>
      <li>Was only able to use whitening pen twice</li>
      <li>I only apply the pen to my top teeth, and have been able to see a serious difference between the top and the bottom.</li>
      <li>I have used it for two weeks now and notice improvement , not dramatic but consistent .</li>
      <li>Teeth should be dry before application - the gel can be spread out better.  </li>
      <li>get very sensitive if I over do it, but so far this had been fine.</li>
      <li>It certainly helps to apply it after drinking coffee to prevent stains.</li>
      <li>The toothbrush is good, although I worry slightly that it is a bit rougher than my old Colgate toothbrush.</li>
      <li>This has worked very well for me.  </li>
      <li>make sure there not really damp</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just kind of messy</li>
      <li>The way it just kind of sits on your teeth can be gross if you talk to someone shortly after</li>
      <li>I feel that it gets the job done with cleaning and my teeth actually feel clean after I am done using it.</li>
      <li>My teeth feel super clean after brushing so that&#x27;s a plus, but my gums are sensitive, so it&#x27;s a bit rough on them.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been applying it mostly at night, and might teeth are slightly whiter.</li>
      <li>I could detect no difference between from the left side to the right side.</li>
      <li>You can always use a normal soft toothbrush and then just apply the pen instead of using this brush, if you want.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I feel like this was a pretty objective</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product over whitestrips or a whitening mouthwash for sensitive teeth and gums!</li>
      <li>Only con to this is that you cannot jst buy the whitening refill and the whole product ranges from $10 - $20 dollars which I find to be a lot of money.</li>
      <li>Make sure you are brushing your teeth for at least two minutes to remove surface stains and not drink anything after applying the gel.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super easy to apply, quick, and it doesn&#x27;t taste bad (it just tastes just like toothpaste).</li>
      <li>The trick to keeping the whitener on your teeth is to dry your teeth off first with a paper towel and then apply the whitening pen.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t know how long it really stays on your teeth.</li>
      <li>Outcome not available due to lack of ability to use more.</li>
      <li>i tried to use a new pen a few weeks after finishing the first one, but my teeth got sensitive, so i would recommend to take bigger breaks in between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I noticed an improvement of about 2 shades in the first few days.  </li>
      <li>Be mindful of the toothbrush - I got the soft bristles, and even those are pretty hard and almost rubbery.</li>

<li> The gel at times was difficult to spread evenly especially on bottom row of teeth.</li>

<li> The whitening solution will start washing off once you close your mouth and give you a minty taste at least it does not taste bad and it normally is all gone within a few minutes.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product.  It gets the job done.  My teeths are looking white.  Everyone complement me how my teeths are looking so white.  It&#x27;s is toothpaste and the pen that make noticeable.  It is a good product to use.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it...</li>
    <li> great expect it doesn&#x27;t seem sanitary after you use the whitening stick and then put it back into the toothbrush. It smells like mildew</li>
    <li> Very easy to use, and I only apply it once a day for 3 days now and I can tell that it is working. I won&#x27;t hesitate to purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I bought this for the whitening agent which was cleverly packaged and promotes convenience and easy application. It&#x27;s hard to tell if it actually whitens on my teeth but I think it does. It certainly helps to apply it after drinking coffee to prevent stains. Colgate should package the whitening agent alone without the toothbrush and reduce the cost and I would purchase more. Taste is flavorful.</li>
    <li> This really works great for teeth whitening! The brush is just right, and the pen will whiten if you use as directed. One huge downside- you have to buy the set, and can&#x27;t just buy whitening pen refills when you run out. Used as directed, the whitening gel will run out around 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> I just tried this and I love it! my favorite part is how the pen goes into the toothbrush two for one deal. I like the toothbrush as well on its own I feel that it gets the job done with cleaning and my teeth actually feel clean after I am done using it. Now the whitening pen I like I noticed a difference just after the first use. Now I only use it once a day instead of two just because with past products like the whitening strips my teeth get very sensitive if I over do it, but so far this had been fine. Make sure you read the label since you are not suppose to use water to clean the tip of the whitening pen! Just to a thin strip of the whitening solution on your teeth make sure there not really damp sometimes it does not stick that great if you have really wet teeth. The whitening solution will start washing off once you close your mouth and give you a minty taste at least it does not taste bad and it normally is all gone within a few minutes. Only con to this is that you cannot jst buy the whitening refill and the whole product ranges from $10 - $20 dollars which I find to be a lot of money.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected !! So different then the commercial!!</li>
    <li> This is a remarkably easy and effective product.  Quick shipment and nice seller.  After one week I see a huge difference.  I did try the expensive whitening procedure with my dentist and it was really not worth the 500.00.  Love this and will be ordering one for my husband.</li>
    <li> I found this product works better for me than the optic whitening trays.</li>
    <li> makes teeth visibly brighter after just a few days as advertised. One pen is enough to make a difference in a color of your teeth in my experience. i tried to use a new pen a few weeks after finishing the first one, but my teeth got sensitive, so i would recommend to take bigger breaks in between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to whiten my teeth at the dentist office, tried whitening stripes, etc., and find this pen as the most effective, painless and easy to use method. Plus, you don&#x27;t need to take an hour (or more) in your daily schedule to work on perfecting your smile :)</li>
    <li> I have used it for two weeks now and notice improvement , not dramatic but consistent . This is the best I can expect and the toothbrush is soft but feels good it reaches all the places I need to get to and does not irritate gums</li>
    <li> This is great for traveling, you can maintain your teeth whitening at home with the this toothbrush and whitening pen. Make sure you are brushing your teeth for at least two minutes to remove surface stains and not drink anything after applying the gel. I&#x27;ve been applying it mostly at night, and might teeth are slightly whiter. The brilliant optic toothpaste works much better, especially if you use it with an electric toothbrush. I pack this with me on my trips to maintain stains from settling in. Oh and i haven&#x27;t found it to cause any sensitivity from using it over a period of a week.</li>
    <li> I have used a whitening mouthwash in the past and noticed a one shade improvement over a couple of months of use.  I then started using the Colgate Optic White Toothbrush and Pen.  This has worked very well for me.  I noticed an improvement of about 2 shades in the first few days.  I continue to use, but haven&#x27;t seen additional improvement in the past 5 or 6 days.  I think it has done all it can for me.  I wouldn&#x27;t blind anybody with my smile, but my teeth are much whiter.  I like the toothbrush with the rubber pads that I think help clean the teeth.  The pen is easy to use...I use 4 clicks for top and 4 clicks for bottoms (more than the recommended 2 and 2).  Teeth should be dry before application - the gel can be spread out better.  I use a paper towel to dry teeth before application.  I have had problems with other whiteners causing sensitivity - but NO PROBLEMS with this pen!  I am very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Use daily and it works g</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!!!!  GOD BLESS YOU!!!!</li>
    <li> Was only able to use whitening pen twice because there.wasn&#x27;t enough in the pen to use more. Outcome not available due to lack of ability to use more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush and pen for around 2 weeks, and I have definitely noticed results. I only apply the pen to my top teeth, and have been able to see a serious difference between the top and the bottom. Be mindful of the toothbrush - I got the soft bristles, and even those are pretty hard and almost rubbery. My teeth feel super clean after brushing so that&#x27;s a plus, but my gums are sensitive, so it&#x27;s a bit rough on them. You can always use a normal soft toothbrush and then just apply the pen instead of using this brush, if you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel pen itself is awesome. If I could buy this alone, I would. It&#x27;s super easy to apply, quick, and it doesn&#x27;t taste bad (it just tastes just like toothpaste). I&#x27;ve had no problem throwing this on in the morning and then running out the door to go to work. I don&#x27;t feel like I need to hide my teeth for 20 min until it dries. I also haven&#x27;t noticed any irritation on my gums, nor my teeth when using it, and it definitely works! I would recommend this product over whitestrips or a whitening mouthwash for sensitive teeth and gums!</li>
    <li> Stuff like this works for different people. I did it consistently and followed the direction step by step, but after 2 weeks still no result.</li>
    <li> After two days and after two weeks--nothing. Like the other one-star rater, I did a half-mouth test using Optic White, but on only the left side. I could detect no difference between from the left side to the right side. I feel like this was a pretty objective test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Followup: After a couple of weeks of using Optic White only on one side of the uppers, I asked my wife if she could tell which side. She correctly said the left side so I have to conclude there was some improvement--but not as much as I would have liked.</li>
    <li> easy to use with good results; haven&#x27;t used the brush yet but the whitening pen is easier to use than I thought it would be</li>
    <li> Works but is don&#x27;t need the toothbrush.  Would rather it came with an actual lid.  The now you use it, the more it works.  I slack for a couple weeks sometime and then start again and it works well enough.</li>
    <li> I love the whitening pen and wish they were sold separately.</li>
    <li> after useing it for about 2 weeks I can see a noticeable improvement. My teeth are whiter. Don&#x27;t expect a miracle, but it does work some.</li>
    <li> I love this tooth brush!</li>
    <li> I sent this to my son and he saw a difference in whiteness of his teeth within a few days! The trick to keeping the whitener on your teeth is to dry your teeth off first with a paper towel and then apply the whitening pen.</li>
    <li> I rate it 3.5 stars.  I love the convenience of the whither being right in the brush.  Brilliant.  The brush head is wonderful (it is manual) and the whitening pen stays in place.  I just think the whitening is a little goopy.  I have gotten a better hang of it.  I would say after a week of use, I have noticed my teeth do appear slightly whiter.  I also use the optic white toothpaste too which I love.  I am not sure if the pen will dry out but my guess it will last the life of the toothbrush and for the price I do think it is worth it.  I just wish the solution was a little quicker in drying.</li>
    <li> Have already used this before, bought at a Local Superstore, good value for money and truly satisfied with the results.</li>
    <li> I ordered about 2 weeks before important event to whiten my smile because I laugh and smile a lot.  I brushed with Colgate whitening toothpaste and then used whitening pen and it worked.  The whitening gel did not irritate mouth at all and my teeth were definitely whiter.  Pleased with this product and soooo much cheaper than dentist or the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; whitener.</li>
    <li> Aside from the toothbrush being a good toothbrush when I first started to use the whitening pen I did notice a difference after a couple of days use. The gel at times was difficult to spread evenly especially on bottom row of teeth. Overall I do recommend as it does work.</li>
    <li> When I received this product, I looked at the additional information on this.  I&#x27;m only saying all of this because I don&#x27;t see a review with the additional information about using this when you&#x27;ve had some dental work done.  On the information sheet inside underneath \\&quot;Additional Information\\&quot; it says \\&quot;Will Colgate® Optic White Toothbrush + Whitening Pen whiten my dental work?\\&quot; then it says \\&quot;If you have dental work, consult your dentist before using.  It is not intended to whiten caps, crowns, veneers, fillings, or dentures.\\&quot;  It also says that this product is enamel safe.  I don&#x27;t see where it says that on the box, but it&#x27;s on the information sheet inside.</li>
    <li> I put it on my teeth and as soon as i close my mouth it comes off. Maybe its cause i have an overbite but still. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> After a week I did notice a distinct difference but it&#x27;s not the easiest option. The way it just kind of sits on your teeth can be gross if you talk to someone shortly after and I don&#x27;t know how long it really stays on your teeth. It&#x27;s a good option if you just need to whiten a little bit or take care of some spots, but it&#x27;s not going to get them bright white. The toothbrush is good, although I worry slightly that it is a bit rougher than my old Colgate toothbrush. I was good about using the gel the first couple of weeks, but despite it saying you should continue to use it, I haven&#x27;t been very consistent. It&#x27;s just kind of messy but my teeth have definitely benefited from me using it.</li>
    <li> The toothbrush is a little too harsh for gums and the whitening pen is clumpy.  It does work and I did notice a difference after a few times of use, but the toothbrush made my teeth hurt after a week of using and as with all whitening agents, your teeth and gums will be sensitive, so use sparingly and not everyday.  Not a bad concept but it was gloopy.</li>
    <li> No refills for this, are you kidding, $15 for a toothbrush and no refills for the whitener.  What a waste of money.</li>
