<ol>
      <li>Great!</li>
      <li>Great brush!</li>
      <li>Just perfect</li>
      <li>Really great.</li>
      <li>This is just a great brush if you have thicker or longer hair.</li>
      <li>but I do find tangles that it has not reached like a good comb would.</li>
      <li>I simply love this brush!</li>
      <li>I love it period!</li>
      <li>This brush is truly amazing.</li>
      <li>This brush is kind of amazing.  </li>
      <li>and it was so amazing</li>
      <li>It does a great job on my waist length super fine and tangly hair.  </li>
      <li>I do like the paddle brush better than the oval shape.</li>
      <li>And for sure buy this for brushing children&#x27;s hair.</li>
      <li>This was a gift, and I absolutely love it.  </li>
      <li>I love love this brush.</li>
      <li>I love this brush.</li>
      <li>My one perfect brush, Others tangle in my very long hair.</li>
      <li>My stylist recommend I get this brush to help with tangles and to be gentler on my fine hair.</li>
      <li>I like it better than my Tangle Teezer because it seems more gentle</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>Very nice brush and definitely combs through w/o tangles.  </li>
      <li>These are so wonderful for anyone with thick hair.</li>
      <li>Waist long curly hair - this brush is a life saver, I own 2 of them.</li>
      <li>Easy to detangle hair without breaking or damaging your hair, easy to blow dry.</li>
      <li>I like it very much.</li>
      <li>At first, they look at me like: Really, a hair brush?</li>
      <li>I use it on dry hair mostly though.  </li>
      <li>bought two more wet Brushes in the oval shape and they are much firmer and more like regular brushes and don&#x27;t work nearly as well for me.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so gentle and yet works so well.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever go back to cheap brushes.</li>
      <li>The bristles are very pliable and will bend before they break your hair.  </li>
      <li>she wants to straighten.</li>
      <li>But all of them have come back to me later and said something along the lines of: &amp;#34;The brush you gave me is MY FAVORITE,</li>
      <li>Works great on dry hair too, but an absolute must for long wet hair.</li>
      <li>Well worth the extra couple bucks.</li>
      <li>Obviously you can&#x27;t rip it through tangles from scalp to tip - use normal gentle de-tangling procedures and start at the tips and work up in sections.  </li>
      <li>I have a regular wet brush as well, but my hair is too long and thick for it to be really perfect.</li>
      <li>In the description it said it would be gentle on my hair and not like a regular brush, it still feels like a regular brush.</li>
      <li>I have fine, delicate hair and this brush is soft enough to brush through it with ease.</li>
      <li>This brush is so gentle, does not pull out your hair at all and combs out tangles, wet or dry, with ease.</li>

<li> It combs through long, wet hair with virtually  one stroke.</li>

<li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this brush</li>
<li> Gets out even the worst tangles for wet hair after shampooing.</li>

    <li> My one perfect brush, Others tangle in my very long hair. I use this IN THE SHOWER when I wash my hair.</li>
    <li> So far so good. Doesn&#x27;t pull on the hair but I do find tangles that it has not reached like a good comb would.</li>
    <li> I have a regular wet brush as well, but my hair is too long and thick for it to be really perfect. So, I bought this paddle brush. Let me tell you, I did not know the difference it would make until I blow dried my hair. It took half the time, seriously, than with the regular wet brush. This is just a great brush if you have thicker or longer hair. Well worth the extra couple bucks.</li>
    <li> Just perfect I like it very much.</li>
    <li> This brush is kind of amazing.  It does a great job on my waist length super fine and tangly hair.  I use it on dry hair mostly though.  The bristles are very pliable and will bend before they break your hair.  Obviously you can&#x27;t rip it through tangles from scalp to tip - use normal gentle de-tangling procedures and start at the tips and work up in sections.  I like it better than my Tangle Teezer because it seems more gentle and it&#x27;s a lot easier to hold onto.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought two more wet Brushes in the oval shape and they are much firmer and more like regular brushes and don&#x27;t work nearly as well for me.</li>
    <li> Great! Brush through long thick wet hair no snags.  Wish I had this years ago. Really great. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this brush! It stinks like a rubber tire swing &amp; feels cheap:(  I&#x27;m shocked that so many people gave this product 5 stars...</li>
    <li> In the description it said it would be gentle on my hair and not like a regular brush, it still feels like a regular brush. I am not satisfied with the product, I don&#x27;t recommend, and don&#x27;t plan on ever purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> I love love this brush. I have fine, delicate hair and this brush is soft enough to brush through it with ease. I give these as gifts to my nieces and cousins that have long hair. At first, they look at me like: Really, a hair brush? But all of them have come back to me later and said something along the lines of: &amp;#34;The brush you gave me is MY FAVORITE, thank you!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This was a gift, and I absolutely love it.  It&#x27;s so gentle and yet works so well.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever go back to cheap brushes.</li>
    <li> product is as advertised</li>
    <li> These are so wonderful for anyone with thick hair. And for sure buy this for brushing children&#x27;s hair. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this brush</li>
    <li> Very nice brush and definitely combs through w/o tangles.  My hair is thick though, and the one thing it doesn&#x27;t do as well on my hair is straightening when drying...it just doesn&#x27;t grip tightly enough.  My daughter loves the brush though, she doesn&#x27;t have curly hair she wants to straighten.</li>
    <li> Wife writing. Waist long curly hair - this brush is a life saver, I own 2 of them. Gets out even the worst tangles for wet hair after shampooing. Works great on dry hair too, but an absolute must for long wet hair.</li>
    <li> I have three tender headed girls. This brush does not pull when hair is wet or dry. I recommend to everyone to by this brush. I do like the paddle brush better than the oval shape.</li>
    <li> I bought one for my 9 year old daughter as it was a constant battle to get her to brush her thick curly hair and it was so amazing I had to buy one for myself!  I have long thick wavy hair myself.</li>
    <li> This brush is truly amazing. It combs through long, wet hair with virtually  one stroke. This will be the only brush I will ever use again.</li>
    <li> Great brush! Flows through hair with ease!</li>
    <li> I love this brush. My stylist recommend I get this brush to help with tangles and to be gentler on my fine hair. This brush is so gentle, does not pull out your hair at all and combs out tangles, wet or dry, with ease.</li>
    <li> I simply love this brush! My hair is wavy/curly and long, and this brush does wonders! Easy to detangle hair without breaking or damaging your hair, easy to blow dry. I love it period!</li>
