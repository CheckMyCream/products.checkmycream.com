      <li>I have tried a number of wax pomade products and this by far is the best.  </li>
      <li>Works well on my annoyingly fine hair texture!</li>
      <li>It is very light and does not look like I have a lot of product to keep my hair in place.</li>
      <li>I had to put it in the microwave before even being able to apply it .&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
      <li>Will buy more.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Redkin Water Wax for years and love it.  </li>
      <li>and this is for sure NOT a knock off.  </li>
      <li>this &amp;#34;pomade&amp;#34; makes it look oily and doesn&#x27;t give it a stylish texturized</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I love Redkin products.  </li>
      <li>This is a tried and tested product that works well with most types of hair.</li>
      <li>So, instead of wasting more time, I ordered at Amazon.com</li>
      <li>I was hoping for more of a waxy pomade.  </li>
      <li>Mostly for shine defining finish, not styling.</li>
      <li>Wish I could find a cheaper substitute, but better this than nothing.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>I was happy to find Redkin Water Wax on Amazon at a price that was much lower than retail.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I love this</li>
      <li>Love the sheen this gives my textured hair.</li>
      <li>Most of the times Amazon has much better price and the delivery service is faster.</li>
      <li>Love this.</li>
      <li>This is more for a Man than a Woman, IMO.  </li>
      <li>The fragrance is not as it should be, and the product is more like vaseline.  </li>
      <li>This is the same, great Water Wax, but shame on Redken for increasing their plastic packaging!</li>
      <li>I was vey excited to find this product and the results have been amazing.  </li>
      <li>Very light and easy to use</li>
      <li>Good to find a more reasonable price.</li>
      <li>Given the high price of the product, one would expect it to perform well in some area, but it truly is nothing remarkable in any category I found after 2 weeks of use.  </li>
      <li>In addition, it has a free shipping on most of its products.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s lightweight, non-greasy and works exceptionally well for straight hair of a thin-medium thickness.</li>
      <li>Shows layers easily.</li>
      <li>Styling is easy and it stays in shape without the hardness.</li>
      <li>but it doesn&#x27;t have a strong of a smell as the Redken Polish Up Pomade.</li>
      <li>It works well with out a strong odor.</li>
      <li>Also, it doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor</li>
      <li>Washes/rinses out easily, &amp; will keep the fine hairline fly-aways neat.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair, but a ton of it</li>
      <li>This product is fine, I&#x27;m not one to use alot of pomade</li>
      <li>Great for short hair.  </li>
      <li>Fantastic product - non greasy</li>
      <li>this product is fabulous and it holds my hair in place</li>
      <li>Is it a genuine product?</li>
      <li>This product is great for short, spikey look.  </li>
      <li>THIS WAS NOT THE ORIGINAL PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>THE ORIGINAL DOES.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Those by far are my favorite and have always worked for me!</li>
      <li>Great product for a sleek slightly wet look.</li>
      <li>It has a light fresh smell.</li>
      <li>This pomade seems to keep fly aways under control and does not weigh my hair down.</li>
      <li>What I really like is that the product easily washes out,</li>
      <li>This product is very sticky and didn&#x27;t rub into my hair easily.  </li>
      <li>Unsure about straight or fine hair.</li>
      <li>The product is very good, but I ultimately prefer American Crew.</li>
      <li>It does give your hair a nice shine, and will hold your hair in place as long as you stay cool.</li>
      <li>I use it right after the shower.  </li>
      <li>Delivery of the product was very fast.</li>
      <li>Best hair product ever , but getting harder and harder to find!  </li>
      <li>Actually a wax where others are more of a cream.</li>
      <li>This is pretty close to the dfi pomade.</li>
      <li>It feels really smooth and natural throughout the day.  </li>
      <li>I scooped the product from this new super sized container and put it right into the old.</li>
      <li>Even though I find it costlier than others, I really like how it works for my hair.</li>
      <li>This is the real stuff.  </li>
      <li>It smells real pretty&lt;</li>
      <li>It is light weight and gives just enough sheen and separation to my ends.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> A little too thick for my liking.</li>
    <li> Water wax is an excellent product if you&#x27;re looking to smooth frizz and create a sleek shine. It&#x27;s lightweight, non-greasy and works exceptionally well for straight hair of a thin-medium thickness. And it smells great too! Caution: Very low hold. Look elsewhere if you&#x27;re trying to defy gravity.</li>
    <li> I love this product. If they ever discontinue it I will be hard pressed to find a replacement.</li>
    <li> Redkins water wax makes my hair shiny and makes the the low lights in my hair stand out.  What I really like is that the product easily washes out, a little bit of product goes a long way,  my hair is soft and can run my fingers thru, and can reajust the style if I desire.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for almost forever. I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;It is water based, not sticky and doesn&#x27;t make your hair hard and stiff.&lt;br /&gt;I like buying from Amazon.  Most of the times Amazon has much better price and the delivery service is faster. In addition, it has a free shipping on most of its products.</li>
    <li> This is the real stuff.  I&#x27;ve been using it for year and this is for sure NOT a knock off.  Good stuff, add&#x27;s a good shine and does not make my hair greasy at all.</li>
    <li> I have a difficult time finding this product where we live, so Amazon is always my next option for this purchase.</li>
    <li> For me, this hair product has been essential! I have thick hair but keep it cut short with lots of layers as it grows really fast. So, this pomade allows me to separate the layers without having a heavy or weighted down look and feel to my hair.  I began using this product about 6 or 7 years ago, but continue to use it as it is just a perfect weight for my hair style. I definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Delivery of the product was very fast. I ordered water wax pomade from amazon because I&#x27;ve been looking for this product everywhere in Duane Reade (i mean product saying &amp;#34;water wax 03&amp;#34; in green color as shown ) but i received water wax  which is almost same  except water wax 03 written in blue color and it says &amp;#34;texture&amp;#34; which i could of buy in Duane Read. I&#x27;ve ordered same water wax 03 hopping to receive water wax with green writing but it was same story shown was what i was expected but i receive with blue writing saying texture. It is different . I still keep it because it chipper then in Duane Reade and i needed anyway. It would be good to receive the product that shown.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Redken 03 Water Wax for the past 5 years plus.  My hair is short and like most Asian hair - very difficult to style when short.  Most other products can get the job done but the results are stiff hair like a broom.  Redken 03 Water Wax will allow me to style my hair and yet when it dries, there is no feeling of having a thistle brush on my head.  It feels really smooth and natural throughout the day.  I was vey excited to find this product and the results have been amazing.  I highly recommend this if you have stiff short hair and your other products don&#x27;t cut it.  I use it right after the shower.  And it maintains a great look until the end of the day.</li>
    <li> Excellent seller, excellent product</li>
    <li> Keeps my short hair in place all night with the right amount of movement and you would never know that I had it in if you felt my hair.</li>
    <li> Love this product! It is Lightweight and gives my hair a nice even curl and sheen. It Smells great too!</li>
    <li> it is kindy of tacky, sticky feel.  I was hoping for more of a waxy pomade.  Doesn&#x27;t hold that well.</li>
    <li> A FAKE : THIS WAS NOT THE ORIGINAL PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product before, bought in a beauty shop. It was soft &amp; gel-like &amp; did wonders to my hair, manageable &amp; curls looking fresh &amp; shiny.&lt;br /&gt;The consistency of this one was so hard  I had to put it in the microwave before even being able to apply it .&lt;br /&gt;Once finally applied, it made my hair really dirty looking, like hard straw &amp; IN NO WAY  WHAT THE ORIGINAL DOES.&lt;br /&gt;Please do  not throw your money away on this specific product sold by this vendor .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed : I haver never had a bad experience with Amazon &amp; always have thought it to choose reputable&lt;br /&gt;vendors / products</li>
    <li> This product is not the same as the previous version 03 in the gray container. The previous product was a whip and this is a thick gel.</li>
    <li> A few years ago, I cut off all my hair and bleached half of it blonde and dyed the other half blue. Thus began my search for the perfect hair goo. My hair is so fine and limp that even after cutting it down to a few inches and viciously damaging it with bleach, it still wouldn&#x27;t stand up straight without help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Redken Water Wax has been my mainstay for several years now. What I like about it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It doesn&#x27;t dry hard, so I can still run my hands through my hair without ripping bits of it out&lt;br /&gt;* It&#x27;s clear with a little bit of shimmer, so if I don&#x27;t rub it in all the way I don&#x27;t have gross white chunks stuck in my hair&lt;br /&gt;* It smells real pretty&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like about it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* You can&#x27;t buy it in stores. But that&#x27;s why g-d invented Amazon!</li>
    <li> Great product for a sleek slightly wet look. Medium relaxed hold. Will buy more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a girl with longish hair. This product really smooths the flyways with out causing my hair to look weighted down. Love it.</li>
    <li> The product came liquified and only half full.  Useless.  Not worth the hassle of sending it back for replacement.  Beware.</li>
    <li> Love this.Shows layers easily. Just be careful.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Having used this product for some years, bought from my hairdressers,  I thought  that I would order it directly from Amazon. I am very disappointed .  The fragrance is not as it should be, and the product is more like vaseline.  This product leaves my hair in greasy clumps, and not the fragrant shine and control that I have been used to for the last few years. Is it a genuine product?</li>
    <li> Best hair product ever , but getting harder and harder to find!  As # goes up so does firmness of hold.  The 03 feels like nothing in your hair.</li>
    <li> In addition to being a great pomade with just the right amount of hold, Redken 03 smells great.  I could not find the product at a number of local hair salons. So, instead of wasting more time, I ordered at Amazon.com and I had the pomade in a couple of days.</li>
    <li> Great Product - Great Service. Timely Delivery. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is more for a Man than a Woman, IMO.  For short hair, you can get a very natural look with the right amount of hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t stick like hair spray, gel, or mousse.  It doesn&#x27;t look very slick like mouse or gel&#x27;s can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It holds, but break up if you mess with your hair.  It&#x27;s water soluble, so it washes out.  BUT, if you play sports, it may irritate, but won&#x27;t be harsh on your eyes if it gets in.  Nothing you can&#x27;t wipe with a sleeve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s SUPERB on Frizzy hair.  And can make \\&quot;morning hair\\&quot; unwashed look good and natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazing stuff.  Wish I could find a cheaper substitute, but better this than nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried EVERYTHING known.  Every Frizz, Every Gell, Every Mousse.  So this is just great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if you have LONG hair, you have to use a bit more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I can NOT speak to is how it affects THIN hair.  I have thick hair and it&#x27;s PERFECT for my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Redkin Water Wax for years and love it.  I&#x27;ve been unable to find it in retail stores, so have tried other products, but have found nothing I like as much.  I was happy to find Redkin Water Wax on Amazon at a price that was much lower than retail.</li>
    <li> Really awesome hair gel to keep hairs in place. I have thick, brown hair that likes to get a little frizzy. This pomade seems to keep fly aways under control and does not weigh my hair down.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product - non greasy</li>
    <li> Dependable as always.  Not spectacular, but does texturize and separate quite well.</li>
    <li> This is my husband&#x27;s one and only hair \\&quot;styling\\&quot; product.  My stylist recommended it to me probably about 10 years ago when I had shorter hair and my husband started using it then.  He&#x27;s tried a lot of other products and was heartbroken when it seemed like Redken seemed to have stopped making it (still not sure if this is true, just know it&#x27;s hard to find in salons).  We were thrilled to find it at Amazon and ordered a few.  Yeah Amazon!</li>
    <li> used Joico Brilliantine for years, not made anymore, soooooooooooo disappointing.  have been looking for 2 years for a replacement, this is the closest I have found.  very satisfied</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t consider this a wax pomade.&lt;br /&gt;This is almost a gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It definitely holds. However, for my hair type(coarse hair) this &amp;#34;pomade&amp;#34; makes it look oily and doesn&#x27;t give it a stylish texturized look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If i were to recommend a couple of pomades they would be: tigi&#x27;s s factor creamy mold, tigi&#x27;s matte seperation, paul mitchell&#x27;s firm style dry wax, and paul mitchell&#x27;s tea tree shaping cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those by far are my favorite and have always worked for me! check them out if you are looking for wax pomades.</li>
    <li> When I got it, the color of the package was darker than the one&#x27;s I bought at retail, and the consistency was strange (in a bad way).</li>
    <li> I love Redkin products.  Just a little of this goes a long way.  Helps make my hair look less dry and more smooth.</li>
    <li> Have been using this in combination with the Glass Smoothing Serum and it holds hair in place and leaves it shiny.</li>
    <li> I used this product when I straighten my hair and have those pieces of hair that just don&#x27;t like to lay flat. This product does the trick with leaving that sticky feeling or making my hair look like I put glue in it. I will get this product again.</li>
    <li> This is the same, great Water Wax, but shame on Redken for increasing their plastic packaging! At a time when we should be searching for better packaging, Redken not only increased the overall size of the tub, they have made it too bulky to be convenient to take while traveling.  I scooped the product from this new super sized container and put it right into the old.</li>
    <li> Excellent, I used it before and it is a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Concisely put, the product has no hold, nor does it ever dry.  It does have a high amount of shine, but that is about the only quality it offers.  Given the high price of the product, one would expect it to perform well in some area, but it truly is nothing remarkable in any category I found after 2 weeks of use.  Save your money on this one.</li>
    <li> This product, Redken 03 Water Wax Pomade 1.7 Ounces was not exactly what I was looking for, I did try!</li>
    <li> Washes/rinses out easily, &amp; will keep the fine hairline fly-aways neat. Works well on my annoyingly fine hair texture!</li>
    <li> Works great on my frizzy hair!  Smells great! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Great for short hair.  Gives it shine and soft control.  Water Wax was recommended by my hairdresser.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product is hard to find at the salons, and it is cheaper online, especially if you have prime !</li>
    <li> this product has been difficult to find lately.  it has good hold without being terribly greasy, but also adds a little shine.</li>
    <li> This stuff has little to no hold if get out in the heat. It does give your hair a nice shine, and will hold your hair in place as long as you stay cool.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  It controls all of my fly aways!  It is a handy tool, and cheaper online than in a salon.</li>
    <li> Gives you great hold, but without the stiffness of a gel.  It works great for wavy or curly hair.  Unsure about straight or fine hair.</li>
    <li> Guys if you want your hair looking nice this is the stuff to get.  Winter time I have to switch to wax.</li>
    <li> Mostly for shine defining finish, not styling. But this product works great for both. The product is very good, but I ultimately prefer American Crew.</li>
    <li> This is a tried and tested product that works well with most types of hair. It works well with out a strong odor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product on my short hair for several years and really like it.  It&#x27;s not oily like so many of the pomades, and although expensive, I only need a little to style my hair, so a container lasts a very long time.  Also, it doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor so I don&#x27;t feel like it competes with my perfume.  My new hairdresser has started using it because she loves how it looks in my hair.</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair in a pixie cut, which can be hard to tame but this works well. It is very light and does not look like I have a lot of product to keep my hair in place. My only concern is that i have to use a bit jmore of the wax per styling when compared to other similar products that have lasted longer (but were more expensive).</li>
    <li> You would think this pomade is gold the price is so high. Good to find a more reasonable price. Product arrived promptly and beautifully wrapped.</li>
    <li> Very light and easy to use</li>
    <li> Just o.k. not what I expected.</li>
    <li> Not greasy. Not hard gel. This is one of the best hair styling products I&#x27;ve ever used. Even though I find it costlier than others, I really like how it works for my hair. Styling is easy and it stays in shape without the hardness.</li>
    <li> I used to use dfi dtails and have been running through a lot of trial and error trying to find a replacement since it was discontinued. This is pretty close to the dfi pomade. It&#x27;s a little heavy but it doesn&#x27;t have a strong of a smell as the Redken Polish Up Pomade.</li>
    <li> My favorite!  Makes hair shiny and manageable without stickiness or stiffness.  I always have this on hand.  Lasts a long time as well.</li>
    <li> This product is fine, I&#x27;m not one to use alot of pomade but when I do this product does the job.</li>
    <li> No problems.  Love this product.</li>
    <li> Love the sheen this gives my textured hair. It has a light fresh smell.</li>
    <li> everything was as expected</li>
    <li> this product is fabulous and it holds my hair in place</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product at all.  I was looking for a pomade to use after straightening my hair to tame frizzies.  This product is very sticky and didn&#x27;t rub into my hair easily.  I went back to using my old pomade.</li>
    <li> I love this Redken product, I have thin, long hair and after blow drying, 2 dime size amounts gives my hair not only texture, it looks fuller and shinier!  (</li>
    <li> This wax is amazing! I have been using it for years! It is light weight and gives just enough sheen and separation to my ends. I also use it on my flyaways. A little goes a very long way and it also helps with second day hair as well. I have fine hair, but a ton of it and I&#x27;ll also use this product combined with a good tease to get some great volume!</li>
    <li> This and Rusk Mousse are my two can&#x27;t-live-without hair products.  I switch between various brands of hairspray, shampoo, conditioner, and hair oils, but Redken Water Wax 03 and Rusk Mousse are beyond compare.  There just isn&#x27;t anything else on the market that even comes close to either of them.</li>
    <li> This product is great for short, spikey look.  A little goes a long way and works for the look I want.</li>
    <li> I have tried a number of wax pomade products and this by far is the best.  Actually a wax where others are more of a cream.</li>
