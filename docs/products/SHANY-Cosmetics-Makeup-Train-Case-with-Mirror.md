      <li>It is also quite nice looking.  </li>
      <li>I will honestly say i had some doubts before the purchase but glad now that I did.  </li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t have an issue with it&#x27;s compact size, but if you eventually get to filling it up, the case won&#x27;t be able to close</li>
      <li>I think I just need more stuff on the bottom.</li>
      <li>then I would recommend looking elsewhere; I&#x27;m sure there are better train cases on the market than this.</li>
      <li>for the case itself, it&#x27;s just okay.</li>
      <li>Would have been better if the drawers pulled out in both directions like a tackle box.</li>
      <li>Cute box.</li>
      <li>I was finding at most retail-cosmetic places.  </li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>They also took the time to make sure that it was wrapped so that when it arrived safely and it did.</li>
      <li>love it.</li>
      <li>love the color and the design.</li>
      <li>This case is lovely to look at, but one of the pictures shows nail polish in the bottom portion of the case.  </li>
      <li>We needed a place to put it in, and we finally found a good case!</li>
      <li>I returned it as I don&#x27;t want to have to fit with my make up case.</li>
      <li>Easy clean up.</li>
      <li>Perfect for travel and carrying everyday makeup around for touch ups after work.</li>
      <li>Fits about 15 Mac eyeshadows on the bottom and brushes also fit in there as well.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t fit all her competition hair and make up in the case.  </li>
      <li>Plus it&#x27;s cute and fun to use.</li>
      <li>Well worth the price!</li>
      <li>The compartments fold out easily and the mirror makes it easy for her to get ready no matter where she is!</li>
      <li>This was a Christmas present for my 16 year old, she LOVED it!  </li>
      <li>It is fun and durable.</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly, looked exactly as pictured.</li>
      <li>some how and would never lock right again.</li>
      <li>you have a larger makeup collection or you want something more sturdy</li>
      <li>Cute, but much smaller than I had envisioned .  </li>
      <li>very cute... fits all of my everyday makeup.  </li>
      <li>It holds all of my everyday products and most of my special occasion stuff.</li>
      <li>the shipping was fast.</li>
      <li>Much more durable than some of the other brands I looked at.  </li>
      <li>if you, like me, impulse order things in the middle of the night, you will benefit from my mild folly.  </li>
      <li>I love the different levels and how they allow me to organize all of my different components.</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
      <li>It is small (nail polish bottles will not fit in it standing upright as shown in one of the photos) but very good for the main items we use.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s prone to falling over unless you have a lot of makeup weighing it down to keep it in place, but I don&#x27;t think it would fit that much to begin with.</li>
      <li>Lightweight and has just the right amount of compartments for items necessary to do a makeover.</li>
      <li>make sure you read the dimensions - apparently I didn&#x27;t, and this was quite a bit smaller than I was expecting, but that&#x27;s totally all on me.  </li>
      <li>and it is easy to fold back for traveling and or moving to other rooms of the house.  </li>
      <li>Bought this for my nine year old daughter to keep her nail polish organized and she loves it.  </li>
      <li>I am giving it a 4-star rating because of the fact that it is a bit top heavy when completely open and can tip.</li>
      <li>the fact that it&#x27;s small, and you can carry it around easily.</li>
      <li>Made well - a little more expensive than I think is worth it - tips over a lot even when top mirror not up, so have to be careful.</li>
      <li>We all have a collection of colors/products we rarely use and though all will not fit in this, the cosmetics we need daily certainly will.  </li>
      <li>My ten year old loves makeup, and her makeup was everywhere,</li>

    <li> no room for anything and will not stay closed properly was supposed to come with a lock no lock save your money!!!!!</li>
    <li> This case is beautiful. A little smaller than I expected but has a mirror, and pull out trays that I find very convenient. Arrived within 2 days and in great condition.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it.  Perfect size for her.  Much more durable than some of the other brands I looked at.  I am giving it a 4-star rating because of the fact that it is a bit top heavy when completely open and can tip.</li>
    <li> if you, like me, impulse order things in the middle of the night, you will benefit from my mild folly.  make sure you read the dimensions - apparently I didn&#x27;t, and this was quite a bit smaller than I was expecting, but that&#x27;s totally all on me.  It&#x27;s functional, compact, is not malodorous in any way, and seems to contain things well (none of my cosmetics seem to have escaped its metal walls yet, so, there&#x27;s that).</li>
    <li> Bought this for my nine year old daughter to keep her nail polish organized and she loves it.  I love the color looks great.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect size. Not too big, not to small.  The only thing that drives me crazy, is when it&#x27;s all the way open it tips over. I think I just need more stuff on the bottom. I do like the plastic covering on the bottom of each level. Easy clean up.</li>
    <li> This case is sturdy and perfect for my needs. It has plenty of room for my daily use makeup and a few extras. The mirror does flop down if the box is jarred but it stays up otherwise. Great case. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Made well - a little more expensive than I think is worth it - tips over a lot even when top mirror not up, so have to be careful.</li>
    <li> Cute box. Would have been better if the drawers pulled out in both directions like a tackle box. Unfortunately it falls over when the drawers are pulled up.</li>
    <li> Too small and falls ones you open the mirror. You have to be holding it when doing your make up.</li>
    <li> I ordered this makeup case because my make up was getting out of control and I needed somewhere to put it all. I received this case today and I love it. It holds all of my stuff and its a beautiful silver color. They also took the time to make sure that it was wrapped so that when it arrived safely and it did. Thank you. -Sharita Pratt</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas present for my 16 year old, she LOVED it!  The compartments fold out easily and the mirror makes it easy for her to get ready no matter where she is!</li>
    <li> I ordered it from amazon and just got it today. It came in excellent conditions and the size is just perfect. The best make up organizer case!  Edit: bought it again for my sister and she loves it as i do!</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with this box.  It is small (nail polish bottles will not fit in it standing upright as shown in one of the photos) but very good for the main items we use.  We all have a collection of colors/products we rarely use and though all will not fit in this, the cosmetics we need daily certainly will.  It is also quite nice looking.  Well worth the price!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sent the color I ordered for starters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the case itself, it&#x27;s just okay. It&#x27;s prone to falling over unless you have a lot of makeup weighing it down to keep it in place, but I don&#x27;t think it would fit that much to begin with. I have a small makeup collection so I don&#x27;t have an issue with it&#x27;s compact size, but if you eventually get to filling it up, the case won&#x27;t be able to close properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a larger makeup collection or you want something more sturdy then I would recommend looking elsewhere; I&#x27;m sure there are better train cases on the market than this.</li>
    <li> This case is easy to carry around and a great size.  Fits about 15 Mac eyeshadows on the bottom and brushes also fit in there as well.</li>
    <li> the shipping was fast. love it. it&#x27;s perfect for me. love the color and the design. the fact that it&#x27;s small, and you can carry it around easily.</li>
    <li> This case is perfect for all of my makeup. I will honestly say i had some doubts before the purchase but glad now that I did.  the compartments, when fully pulled out, allow me to see everything i have and it is easy to fold back for traveling and or moving to other rooms of the house.  It&#x27;s perfect!</li>
    <li> definitely love the item! i bought it as a gift for my friend and i am getting another one for myself!</li>
    <li> Entirely extremely small. Not big enough to hold make up stand up little bottle.</li>
    <li> Handy product. It&#x27;s been working great for me and keeps my make-up neatly in order. Sped up my morning routine, because I don&#x27;t have to dig through or dump out a make-up bag anymore. Plus it&#x27;s cute and fun to use. Does tip over with the trays all extended, but wouldn&#x27;t if I put some heavier items in the bottom compartment. I don&#x27;t mind, just prop it up against the wall. UPDATE: Had to bump this review down from 5, because after a few months the lid got messed up some how and would never lock right again. Had to throw it away, but it was good while it lasted.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a cosmetic case just like this in stores...but was disappointed with the quality and price I was finding at most retail-cosmetic places.  This case is perfect!  Sturdy, holds a lot (I did not think it was too small as others had mentioned).  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Lots of room space, very good product</li>
    <li> I love it!  It is the perfect fit for my makeup and works wonderfully to keep things nice and organized!</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. Very small but it beautiful.</li>
    <li> I like the look of this train case. It is fun and durable. However when I opened it and started to load it, it fell over backwards. I tried to counterbalance by loading heavier items in bottom, but the way the drawer pops up and back made that difficult. I returned it as I don&#x27;t want to have to fit with my make up case.</li>
    <li> Cute, but much smaller than I had envisioned .  Sturdy enough, but wish it was bigger .  Can&#x27;t fit all her competition hair and make up in the case.  Also can&#x27;t fit all the fake eyelashes in the case either.</li>
    <li> very cute... fits all of my everyday makeup.  Not large enough for everything, but small enough that I can actually see myself taking it places with me.</li>
    <li> My ten year old loves makeup, and her makeup was everywhere, (she has a TON of it).  We needed a place to put it in, and we finally found a good case!</li>
    <li> This is perfect to store my makeup in my cupboard. It holds all of my everyday products and most of my special occasion stuff. I love the different levels and how they allow me to organize all of my different components.</li>
    <li> Perfect size and easy to carry.  Lightweight and has just the right amount of compartments for items necessary to do a makeover.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly, looked exactly as pictured. Perfect for travel and carrying everyday makeup around for touch ups after work. I will be taking it everywhere with me... Everyday.</li>
    <li> Great item.  Durable and great for travel.  On the smaller side, but at least it will keep my makeup bill down.</li>
    <li> This case is lovely to look at, but one of the pictures shows nail polish in the bottom portion of the case.  It is NOT deep enough to hold even the smallest bottle of polish standing upright.  Very disappointing because I need a case to hold all my polish.  Thought this was the answer, but my search continues.  Will be sending this back.</li>
