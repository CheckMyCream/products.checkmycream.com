      <li>Beautiful Color Love It!</li>
      <li>Good taste and look.</li>
      <li>Smells good and that&#x27;s about it besides the color.</li>
      <li>I have paid so much more for products that are not as great as NYX products.  </li>
      <li>Love it!</li>

      <li>Moisturizing lip gloss with a nice shine.</li>
      <li>Not as smooth as I would&#x27;ve liked but a very nice gloss.</li>
      <li>very soft and nurishing its amazing and color is awesome</li>
      <li>kinda pools together, but that can be fixed by dabbing it with your fingertips to ensure a flawless finish.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>love it now</li>
      <li>I would recommend it to a friend :)</li>
      <li>I love lip stick</li>
      <li>I love this</li>
      <li>You can use it alone or top a lipstick coat</li>
      <li>This is my favorite lip gloss to use.</li>
      <li>I read a review on Amazon about these and had to try them out and am so glad I listened.  </li>
      <li>Doe foot applicator does an Ok job.  </li>
      <li>but thats ok.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not too bright (I am easing into wearing color on my lips), it just gives my already naturally pink-tinted lips a boost!</li>
      <li>Very pretty color!</li>
      <li>Very pretty pinky nude color with a yummy vanilla cupcake scent!</li>
      <li>The price is fantastic too</li>
      <li>So far apple strudel is my favorite because of the super light color, it&#x27;s kind of a my-lips-but-better shade.  </li>
      <li>This will always be in my makeup case, so far all of the butter colors are just beautiful and natural.</li>
      <li>Lots of shine and pigment plus smells good enough to eat.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s definitely a sweet smell to them- maybe frosting or vanilla</li>
      <li>Love the color!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not sticky or dripping, would definitely would buy more.</li>
      <li>It definitely has good coverage and a pretty color.</li>
      <li>(: just tops off a simple look when you want to look alittle more put together!</li>
      <li>Apple Strudel is really too light for me, but I add a touch of another gloss to deepen it.  </li>
      <li>They go on really nice, barely sticky at all, and they stay pretty well.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The only thing is, it doesn&#x27;t show up on me very well but the more you put on the more color there is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I purchased this color because I loved the other color I have so much (creme brulee).</li>
      <li>I recently ordered Devil&#x27;s Food Cake, though, so apple strudel may be edged out as my favorite.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s the first one I&#x27;ve ever</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>This color is more pink than the creme brulee which is exactly what I wanted!</li>
      <li>Gives a nice little color to my lipstick..</li>
      <li>Very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>So very creamy and pigmented.</li>
      <li>I end up re-applying after two hours or so, but that&#x27;s pretty normal and not an issue.  </li>
      <li>Smells amazing,gloss on,not sticky, and very wearable.</li>
      <li>Its better than any other ones I tried.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t have much colour when I put it on and glides on smooth and keeps lips moist for a long time!</li>
      <li>very natural looking</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not really my cup of tea, but honestly it&#x27;s not unpleasant either.  </li>
      <li>but I prefer the soft matte lip cream.</li>
      <li>Pretty much a gloppy mess.  </li>
      <li>Only complaint is that it is super pigmented and sometimes the gloss</li>
</ol>

    <li> I really love NYX butter glosses!  They go on really nice, barely sticky at all, and they stay pretty well.  I end up re-applying after two hours or so, but that&#x27;s pretty normal and not an issue.  There&#x27;s definitely a sweet smell to them- maybe frosting or vanilla cupcakes?  It&#x27;s not really my cup of tea, but honestly it&#x27;s not unpleasant either.  I have several colors of this gloss: Tiramisu, Fortune Cookie, Strawberry Parfait, and Apple Strudel.  So far apple strudel is my favorite because of the super light color, it&#x27;s kind of a my-lips-but-better shade.  I recently ordered Devil&#x27;s Food Cake, though, so apple strudel may be edged out as my favorite.</li>
    <li> Love the color!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not sticky or dripping, would definitely would buy more.</li>
    <li> I like the gloss but I prefer the soft matte lip cream. It doesn&#x27;t dry your lips and it lasts all day.</li>
    <li> The perfect lipgloss, smells good, doesn&#x27;t stick, the color suits the lips perfectly, the best gloss I ever had (And I have a looot)</li>
    <li> I purchased this color because I loved the other color I have so much (creme brulee). This color is more pink than the creme brulee which is exactly what I wanted! It&#x27;s not too bright (I am easing into wearing color on my lips), it just gives my already naturally pink-tinted lips a boost! I will continue to buy these lip products!</li>
    <li> I love this and it&#x27;s the first one I&#x27;ve ever bought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is, it doesn&#x27;t show up on me very well but the more you put on the more color there is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason why I gave it only 4 stars is because it came 2 1/2 weeks after ordered. Didn&#x27;t like how long it took when I can just run to Ulta.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, great product!</li>
    <li> This is a keeper brand.  The price point is good and the product is really outstanding.  Apple Strudel is really too light for me, but I add a touch of another gloss to deepen it.  I have already purchased another of this brand.</li>
    <li> So very creamy and pigmented. You can use it alone or top a lipstick coat and it looks awesome. Will re-purchase other colors as well!</li>
    <li> Beautiful Color Love It!</li>
    <li> Goes on like butter! Good taste and look.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, the lip butter did not have any sort of wrapper or barcode sealing it closed, so I didn&#x27;t even want to try it. I was too paranoid someone else might have used it. Turned out to be a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Love it. Very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lip gloss to use. Doesn&#x27;t have much colour when I put it on and glides on smooth and keeps lips moist for a long time! Love it!</li>
    <li> Pretty much a gloppy mess.  Great color but terrible consistency and finish.  Doe foot applicator does an Ok job.  Smells good and that&#x27;s about it besides the color.</li>
    <li> very soft and nurishing its amazing and color is awesome and i was happily supprised that it smelled like carmel apples</li>
    <li> Not as smooth as I would&#x27;ve liked but a very nice gloss. I would recommend it to a friend :)</li>
    <li> Unbelievable color very natural looking that is what I like about it the best.  With just a hint of color and a beautiful sheen!  The price is fantastic too I have paid so much more for products that are not as great as NYX products.  I read a review on Amazon about these and had to try them out and am so glad I listened.  This will always be in my makeup case, so far all of the butter colors are just beautiful and natural.</li>
    <li> This kind of gloss is really a favorite of mine, it makes your lips look amazing! Lots of shine and pigment plus smells good enough to eat.</li>
    <li> I like this lip gloss. Its better than any other ones I tried. It doesnt hav a big color pigment though for me but thats ok.</li>
    <li> Was not impressed with this product - gave it away after trying it once.  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s good for some people, it&#x27;s just not for me.</li>
    <li> Moisturizing lip gloss with a nice shine. The fragrance is sometimes nauseating because it smells like a candy factory.</li>
    <li> Gives a nice little color to my lipstick.. love it now I have to continue typing about nonsense to post this</li>
    <li> Great gloss for the price! Very pretty pinky nude color with a yummy vanilla cupcake scent! Only complaint is that it is super pigmented and sometimes the gloss kinda pools together, but that can be fixed by dabbing it with your fingertips to ensure a flawless finish.</li>
    <li> I love lip stick but hate always having to fix it or touch it up. so I was looking for something I can wear, with color, that I wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about. THEN I DESCOVERED THESE! Exactly what I was looking for. A gloss with color. when I say color I don&#x27;t mean a solid color but a hint. Smells amazing,gloss on,not sticky, and very wearable. I wear it almost everyday when I have work(: just tops off a simple look when you want to look alittle more put together!</li>
    <li> This is lip gloss with a great price and a nice shine!  NYX Butter Lip Gloss has not taste...which is great!  It is also long-lasting.  On the down-side, it has that sticky feel a lot of the lower priced lip glosses have.  It definitely has good coverage and a pretty color.</li>
    <li> Very pretty color! Just as expected.</li>
