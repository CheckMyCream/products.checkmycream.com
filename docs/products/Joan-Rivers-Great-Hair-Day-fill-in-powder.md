      <li>Great product for coloring roots between visits to the salon.</li>
      <li>My hair is a medium auburn - would like to see a richer product - but the case and brush are very nice</li>
      <li>Those that love it, great, but it can&#x27;t work if you can&#x27;t get it to transfer fro the brush to your hair/scalp!</li>
      <li>The color is good and it does hide that my hair is thinning</li>
      <li>Good coverage.</li>

      <li>I wasn&#x27;t home when the package arrived, but liked the product</li>
      <li>Color is fine, but you can&#x27;t get it from the brush onto your hair!  </li>
      <li>Product arrived in quickly and in good condition.  </li>
      <li>I am now able to cover my gray roots and postpone coloring for another week or two.  </li>
      <li>I can style my hair and be confident that it doesn&#x27;t have that wiggy look, it doesn&#x27;t flake onto clothes, and stays in until I wash it out about every three days.  </li>
      <li>Glad I made this purchase after thinking and thinking about it.  </li>
      <li>and I like that better than the brush for greater coverage.  </li>
      <li>I bought two when it came out and was very excited till I got them.</li>
      <li>I have the &amp;#34;red&amp;#34;, which blends fairly well and is like a brown-red, auburn color (not at all a bright red).</li>

      <li>Otherwise great, long-lasting and small in size.  </li>
      <li>very fast - thank you</li>
      <li>Possibly will be able to glue it on.  </li>
      <li>would have given 5 stars,  accept brush broke off handle on first flick.  </li>
      <li>Stays on until you shampoo and really does work.</li>
      <li>this one is a real dud.  </li>
      <li>this is the first time that I am using  this powder to cover my bold spots, it blends very well with my hair and last till I wash my hair.</li>

      <li>The red shade is very brown</li>
      <li>so much decided to keep the extra Powder.</li>
      <li>So far, I feel I&#x27;m using a lot of product.  </li>
      <li>It matches my natural hair color too.</li>
      <li>I am 51yrs old with thinning hair.</li>

    <li> Absolutely love this product, easy to use does exactly advertised</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Packaging was intact and shipped very fast - thank you</li>
    <li> It is difficult to apply.  The color is good and it does hide that my hair is thinning but I&#x27;m not skilled enough to apply it and make it look even.</li>
    <li> Only problem with it is its not red.  Its brown w a little reddish hue.  Didn&#x27;t match my auburn at all.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Does what I want which is to conceal my thinning hair in the front on my part.</li>
    <li> Product arrived in quickly and in good condition.  I like the powder and its coverage.  A reviewer I read suggested using a makeup sponge instead of  the brush and I like that better than the brush for greater coverage.  I accidently ordered 2 Fill-in Powders and tried to cancel one and was unable to do so.  The company said to refuse the extra package.  I wasn&#x27;t home when the package arrived, but liked the product so much decided to keep the extra Powder.</li>

    <li> Great product for coloring roots between visits to the salon. I am definitely going to repurchase</li>
    <li> and you die your hair reddish, do NOT buy this color powder... stick with brunette. I will keep it only for the touch up areas around my face.</li>
    <li> At first I had a tiny problem with figuring out how to open the product.  After two tries, I broke the cover off, oops!  The product color I chose was red.  It has been well over my eight weeks that I always color my hair and with Joan&#x27;s product, I can go another week or two.  It works perfectly and no one can tell I am covering unwanted gray.  Glad I made this purchase after thinking and thinking about it.  Awesome and matches perfectly!</li>
    <li> The color is not easily matched.  I have dark brown hair but the the dark brown came as dark grey</li>
    <li> this is the first time that I am using  this powder to cover my bold spots, it blends very well with my hair and last till I wash my hair.</li>
    <li> I am 51yrs old with thinning hair. I have a few balding spots and originally bought this item to use along with a sunscreen foam on my scalp, but now cannot live without it! Stays on until you shampoo and really does work. Actually look much younger after application.</li>
    <li> Great product! Easy to apply. Good coverage.</li>
    <li> Great for women&#x27;s thinning hair!</li>
    <li> IT WAS NOT WHAT I WAS USE TO FROM JOAN RIVERS PRODUCTS . I HAVE USE GREAT HAIR FOR YEARS AND WAS SAD TO SEE IT DISCOUNTED.MAYBE I NEED TO TRY ANOTHER COLORS. PLEASE SEND ME A COUPON</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just what I was looking for.  I am now able to cover my gray roots and postpone coloring for another week or two.  Love it!</li>
    <li> The red shade is very brown If you are a true redhead stay away I bought two when it came out and was very excited till I got them.What a waste of money</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without this product.  It not only covers the grey, it gives my hair body.  I can style my hair and be confident that it doesn&#x27;t have that wiggy look, it doesn&#x27;t flake onto clothes, and stays in until I wash it out about every three days.

    <li> wife luvs this product</li>
    <li> Very disappointed I returned it. Didn&#x27;t work!</li>
    <li> The jury is still out with this....So far, I feel I&#x27;m using a lot of product.  Using this to temporarily cover roots between colorings. I have the &amp;#34;red&amp;#34;, which blends fairly well and is like a brown-red, auburn color (not at all a bright red).</li>
    <li> I can feel comfortable going out for work or play with this product. It matches my natural hair color too.</li>
    <li> Makes hair look full and covers gray where I can reach.  Stays on till washed out.  No one knows it&#x27;s on.  would have given 5 stars,  accept brush broke off handle on first flick.  Possibly will be able to glue it on.  Otherwise great, long-lasting and small in size.  Easy-to-use.&lt;br /&gt;Try it, you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do a thing.  Very, very disappointed.  Color is fine, but you can&#x27;t get it from the brush onto your hair!  I am not new to products,&lt;br /&gt;but this one is a real dud.  Those that love it, great, but it can&#x27;t work if you can&#x27;t get it to transfer fro the brush to your hair/scalp!</li>
