<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love the jewels, it&#x27;s the third set I order from 3 different sellers. I liked these the best because there were multiple sizes which is awesome, also I loved the butterfly, hearts and other shaped jewels. I also liked that the actual wheel was bigger than the other sets I order. They also came in the mail pretty quickly. I am very happy with my order and I will definitely order another set when I run out of these!</li>
    <li> Love the different sizes. Perfect for sparkly nail designs. the wheels are just a bit loose so keep tape on em.</li>
    <li> Loved this!! Exactly what i wanted!! Awesome buy!</li>
    <li> Loved Loved Loved this product</li>
    <li> How can you beat a price like this? I will say that it took a little longer to receive this than most things I order on Amazon, but it was totally worth it. I would have given this a full five stars, but I ended up throwing the glue away. It is super sticky like crazy glue, so be careful with it! Not only did I get my fingers stuck together (oops) and the scissor blades stuck together (I had to cut the tip off...), but after testing the strength of the glue on a rhinestone it ended up being more trouble than it was worth once I wanted to get it off. You can just stick the rhinestones on your semi-wet polish and put a top coat on...it will last a really long time without running the risk of gluing everything in your house to you! All the same, I love the assortment of different embellishments that come with this kit and would totally buy this again.</li>
    <li> The glue was less than half, and some of the rhinestones is a lot less than what I expected. It&#x27;s ok</li>
    <li> I looked at prices on these everywhere and this is the best bargain I found. You get so many shapes and colors!</li>
    <li> there are all these items, dont worry, you get it all... but you dont get as much as it shows... all the decorations are practically all mixed up and there really arent much in them.... the glue doesnt work well and one of the containers for the decorations was way oversized with literally 10 of each decoration... -_- buy it somewhere else and get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I thought for the price this package was too good to be true. I am very please with this rhinestone pack. The glue is very runny and hard to work with. I have been using super glue in its place! Other than that, great set!</li>
    <li> thanks your product is wonderful and keep up the outstanding work</li>
    <li> The color or the pearls bleed when you put clear polish over them. The gems are definitely cheap. They barely shine like they should. I dressed a nail with some of the included gemstones and some that I ordered from a different site, you could really tell the difference between the two different stones. I may just use these on my toes only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> For the most part I was pretty pleased with my purchase . Except the fact that the glue that came with it was previously used and the tip of the glue bottle was caked with dried glue and the bottle was almost completely empty .</li>
    <li> it makes my nails look pretty. the only thing i don&#x27;t like is that it comes with less beads than what the picture shows.</li>
    <li> Ohhh this is so much fun...  All kinds of things to use on your nails.  You will love it!</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s a large variety of nail jewels in this kit. It would have been nice to have a tweezers to facilitate picking up the jewels, but they are available separately. All-in-all there&#x27;s a good variety in the kit and I can&#x27;t wait to get started.</li>
    <li> Very Beautiful! Mines even came with 2 extra wheels and an extra glue. The jewels are very beautiful and can be used for all kinds of designs.</li>
    <li> i really like all of these, except that i thought that the different shaped ones would be a little bit big, they&#x27;re not. they&#x27;re a smaller size and so when i put the clear coat over them you cant really tell what they are anymore.but that is the only complaint i have, they were a very nice addition to my collection of nail things and all my friends love them too.</li>
    <li> I got these a few weeks ago for doing my nails with and they are pretty cool. There is a lot of variety in the colors and shapes and sizes. It also comes with 2 dotting pens which I&#x27;ve been wanting. The only bad part is that shipping took a while, but it was sent from China so I can&#x27;t really complain. Plus it was really cheap.</li>
    <li> Many times with cheaper nail art product when you buy kits like these you get 10 or less per style, but my disks were filled with 30+ of each style color and type of stone or pearl. Very happy with them. The glue is alright, but just get your own bottle for a buck and you are good to go. The dotting tools work perfect, but a pair of tweezers is highly recommended for detail work with the nail art stones and pearls</li>
    <li> Love this, I use thse for nail designs all the time. They&#x27;re wonderful and inexpensive.</li>
    <li> just as described! for the price its unbeatable, and i cannot complain. moderate shipping time, as others said the glue is runny but you can buy your own! love the dotting tools!</li>
    <li> I a, really into doing my own nails and this is just perfect. Comes with such a variety of colors and sizes and they will definitely last a long time. And they stay on a surprisingly long time for being so little. It did take a while to get delivered but was well in the estimated time frame. I would without a doubt recommend it</li>
    <li> These were kind of fun!  Got them for my granddaughters for Christmas and they were delighted!</li>
    <li> I love this when i got it the package was very good and nothing was damaged so this was a good buy and I got it a week earlier</li>
    <li> i ordered  these on June 16 and i have still not yet received it. Very Disappointed! i hope that when i do get them that i will love them but till then im not happy at all</li>
    <li> Great set loved the wheels great colors you can tell they are good quality would def buy from this seller again came quicker than expected and stated when I placed the order just all around amazing I am very pleased</li>
    <li> The glue was empty...?</li>
    <li> Great purchase. Loved these and they shipped fast.</li>
    <li> I really liked mine and the only thing that annoyed me was all the bubble wrap on tape I mean, I wanted to pop the bubble wrap anyways, i was really happy with my payment</li>
    <li> This is fantastic! I can recommend it to all people who need to be more nice their nails.</li>
    <li> Everything is just as expected. I dont use the glue cuz im not too familiar with the brand, but everything else is perfect!</li>
    <li> LOVEEEEE, it was a great set and love my tools. it took a while to arrive, but worth teh wait. love creating new looks for my nails.</li>
    <li> Arrived early than expected.  Still does take time since its shipped from overseas.&lt;br /&gt;The product was very nice and you can&#x27;t beat the price.  The tools included with it alone are worth the price.</li>
    <li> Wow.&lt;br /&gt;She loved it</li>
    <li> It came really fast.Everything that it said it came with it did. the only complaint is that the nail glue was not even half way full at all but other then that everything is all good.</li>
    <li> Got them relatively quickly considering where they were being shipped from and i love them.</li>
    <li> I love what I got! I got three colored rhinestone wheels in 1mm, 2mm, and 3mm sizes, pastel colored half pearls in 1mm and 2mm sizes, and a large wheel containing different colored rhinestone shapes. The dotting tools were a little bit of a put down. One was the generic (my favorite) and the other was a painted wooden one. The paint isn&#x27;t acetone resistant, so cleaning it wiped the pretty purple paint off. It works though and it isn&#x27;t a problem.</li>
    <li> Worth the cost but took a while to get</li>
    <li> Plentiful, can&#x27;t wait to start using them this weekend creating my own designs at home.  Nice Packaging and whole lot of products for reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Great variety! Fast delivery!</li>
    <li> These are okay they are basically the same just different sizes, I thought they were all different</li>
    <li> thank you for everything</li>
    <li> Great quantity, very nice</li>
    <li> I love the product, but the send me the glue bottle empy. Why they do this, if the offer one thing and give yo other</li>
    <li> I loved the price and all the variety but I did think the wheels were going to be larger. I still think it&#x27;s a great deal!</li>
    <li> Popular with clients for their natural or acrylic nails</li>
    <li> This is a great buy and is cheap but is worth it. Shipping wasn&#x27;t to long from where it shipped. Mine came with the full glue and both dotting tools even though others didn&#x27;t. I got it even though I had a 50/50 chance of not getting tools because u don&#x27;t need glue just use topcoat. It came in different packaging than the others. It wasn&#x27;t pink it was polka dotted but that doesn&#x27;t matter. In the second closeup it is a little different cuz they are small in the picture and they aren&#x27;t that little but that doesn&#x27;t matter. I would recommend this to anyone!!!</li>
    <li> great for extra detail on my nails</li>
    <li> Great products! Especially for the price! A huge variety of colors and the dotting tools are an added bonus! I actually had lost my other ones so this was great!</li>
    <li> I wanted the smaller sized Rhinestones and this was a great deal. I have been using them for a few weeks now and i love them.&lt;br /&gt;I plan to get more when i am running low.&lt;br /&gt;They shipped them to me really fast, If your looking for some of the smaller pretties you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  &#x3D;0)</li>
    <li> The first thing that i can say is the shippment came may 4 days early than it was suppose to which was a plus. Also everything was package very well and nothing wasent to out of place. The only thing i can say is some of the pieace in the wheel are just little broken off diamonds and stuff meaning i guess they cracked or something, but it wasent that bad. All the wheels turned smoothly and nothing was out of place. I just wish they gave me more black rinestones well maybe bigger size. Every color came in like 3 size except that one. Over all im happy with this product and seller</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t come with the tools but it was cheap.  I use them with all my nail art now.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s wack the only thing good about this is the glue! Wheels are small and hard to rotate all the rhinestones are the same size..SMALL!</li>
    <li> Containters are a little bit tough to turn but that is a good thing as you don&#x27;t have to worry about gems spilling out. Dotting tools are appropriate size and easy to grip, very good quality. Glue have not used before but if it is as good as the rest I&#x27;m sure she will let me know.</li>
    <li> when I first got this product I was a little bit disappointed because what they sent me didn&#x27;t seem right....the wheels but they had sent me we&#x27;re almost completely empty and they didn&#x27;t send me the glue that came with it. I then contacted the seller they got back to me later the same day and said they would send another one and that they apologized. I will definitely buy from this seller again they were extremely nice and understanding. They also made the shipping faster than what it was originally the first time I bought it I got it in about 2 weeks, and it had everything they said it would.</li>
    <li> I really like a lot of diamonds so they possibilities are endless:)I recommend for a personal touch to your style!</li>
    <li> I bought this to have fun with my nails before vacation! So many different gems its hard to choose! Everything you see in the pic is what you get! Awesome!</li>
    <li> Arrived in the time it said it would, I can&#x27;t remember but I think it was actually early. Everything came as pictured, the glue was plugged but was totally usable after I poked a needle through. The gem wheels are all different and all look very good on my nails.</li>
    <li> The package came earlier than I had expected! The other reviews state that the contents has spilled into the packaging it had come in, but mine were perfect (each wheel was packaged individually). Nice variety of stones and pearls. I very much liked the wheel with the different shaped stones you can&#x27;t find these in a lot of stores (nice +).  I haven&#x27;t checked the glue but it seems ok. The dotting tools are really nice (both are the same size) and have some weight to them which is good. I am glad that I ordered this because at my local beauty store(s) all the items separately would have cost me a small fortune. Can&#x27;t wait to use them this summer I&#x27;m soooo giving my little girls mani&#x27;s and pedi&#x27;s. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> nice variety. love the dotting tools. nice selection of rhinestones. great addition to my nail art collection. thank you so much.</li>
    <li> Thank you. Great price. The containers are hard to open without spilling the jewels. ALL and all I am very satified.</li>
    <li> Nice products but glue bottle was empty.</li>
    <li> I ordered this in the middle of January. It&#x27;s now the end of February, and I still don&#x27;t have this product. I&#x27;ll update this review whenever I get it in, but I want to say that the shipping time on this is far slower than I anticipated. Note when buying, they DO NOT provide you with tracking information. If you want this item within a week or two, they will not get it to you. I&#x27;m at 6+ weeks and still haven&#x27;t gotten it.</li>
    <li> I just received my package of this product and I must say I am quite satisfied with the quality! I would recommend this product for anyone who is looking for a variety of rhinestones.&lt;br /&gt;Since the product description doesn&#x27;t really say a lot about this bundle I will take the time to write a detailed review and upload some photos to help any other nail art fanatics out there make a decision on this great bundle so that you won&#x27;t have to feel like you&#x27;re taking a risk in buying this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping:&lt;br /&gt;The package did take a while to get here. I ordered mine on Oct 30th and received it on Nov 23rd so it took about 3 and a half weeks to get here. I personally find this shipping time reasonable since we do have to take into account that it shipped from China, so I have no complaints about this.&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t want to wait that long to get rhinestones I would recommend items sold by the seller MASH such as [[ASIN:B005BF1M10 MASH Rhinestones 2400 Piece 12 Color Nail Art Nailart Manicure Wheels]]. I have no purchased their rhinestones before so I have no information on the quality of this specific product. I did buy a nail stamping plate set from them that shipped to me in basically one business day that I&#x27;m very satisfied with which is why I&#x27;m recommending their shipping speed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging:&lt;br /&gt;I give 5 stars! My package arrived in a yellow envelope lined with bubble wrap. Everything was tucked into a clear plastic ziplock bag which was wrapped in an additional layer of bubble wrap. The rhinestone wheels were individually wrapped in plastic wrapping. There were no major issues with rhinestone colors getting mixed up. Nothing damaged upon arrival. Two thumbs up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nail Dotting Pens:&lt;br /&gt;The two nail dotting pens have plastic handles which actually have quite a bit of weight to them. They are about 4.5\\&quot; long. The have a swirl design within the plastic which is fun to look at. The swirls are colored and the rest of the handle is clear. I received my dotting pens in white and green. The four tips of the two pens are all different sizes. I approve of the overall quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nail Glue:&lt;br /&gt;The nail glue is a small bottle about 2\\&quot; tall brand name \\&quot;BYB Bond Nail Glue\\&quot; manufactured by \\&quot;BYB Chemical Co.,Ltd\\&quot; . According to the label it&#x27;s 3 grams in weight and it mentions something called \\&quot;Alpha Cyanoacrylate\\&quot; in orange and yellow which I would assume is the main chemical ingredient. Aside from the warning that tells you \\&quot;Keep out of reach of children. Eye irritant. If eye contact occurs flush with water. Seek medical advice at once. If skin bonding occurs peel do not pull apart. Soak in nail polish remover, or acetone.\\&quot; the bottle doesn&#x27;t tell you much.&lt;br /&gt;The glue smells a lot like Krazy glue which seems a bit shifty to me (but then again I&#x27;m not experienced with nail glue so I&#x27;m not aware if nail glue is supposed to smell like that). I had to run a needle through the tip to get the flow going (may be the bottle design or the glue may have dried and blocked up inside the tip I may never know) but aside from the my suspicions of the glue it actually does it&#x27;s job well and attaches the gem tightly to your nail. Some nail polish remover and lots of rubbing does take it off, but if you&#x27;re really worried about glue quality just buy another bottle (or use clear nail polish) and toss the tiny one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Edit]&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m actually convinced that stuff is crazy glue. Dropped a bit too much on someone&#x27;s finger while trying to do her manicure and it dried into that crunchy layer you get when you spill Krazy glue on your hands. Nail polish remover does NOT take it off your skin or bare nails, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;ll come off if you glue it onto a polished nail and removed the nail polish with the remover though (I&#x27;ll do an update if I need to). Earlier result were attempts in removing the \\&quot;nail glue\\&quot; off a plastic surface and it worked somehow. I actually used this nail glue as Krazy glue on an art project andit worked that role pretty well. So if you don&#x27;t want Krazy glue on your nails do get another brand of Nail glue!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rhinestone Wheels:&lt;br /&gt;I love these wheels! Each wheel is about 2\\&quot; in diameter. I tested all 6 wheels and I have no issues with them getting stuck mid turn. The way I turn them is putting it on my left palm and using my right palm I place it on top of the wheel and apply slight pressure while twisting my hands. I make sure I position my right hand so that the opening of the wheel is at the curve between my thumb and pointer finger so I can see if the opening has reached the color stones I want.&lt;br /&gt;I also tried twisting the wheels with one hand holding the bottom white half of the wheel and the other twisting the clear half and there weren&#x27;t huge issues with turning them in that method either. :)&lt;br /&gt;The walls separating the colors are tall enough (even for the smallest sized rhinestones in this bundle) that the stones can&#x27;t jump walls if you shake them or turn the wheel. The walls are not too tall that it hinders the wheel&#x27;s ability to turn.&lt;br /&gt;One thing I would like to make note of is that the rhinestones have a bit of static to them so they like to stick to the top half of the wheel (but once again the walls keep them from going to the other section).  However for the fuller wheels the rhinestones may decide to stick onto the side of the opening of the wheel when it gets there and hitch a ride to the section next door, so be aware of that.&lt;br /&gt;The wheels look clean and shiny and new. I give 5 stars to their quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rhinestones:&lt;br /&gt;In this bundle I received 2 wheels of pearl beads (one wheels size large and the other size small), 1 wheel of rhinestones in shapes (stars, teardrops, triangles... etc), and 3 wheels of round rhinestones (one wheel size small one wheels size medium and one wheel size large. The medium and large sizes don&#x27;t differ by a lot so they are all small enough for your nails). These are exactly the types pictured in the product description. No false advertising!&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the rhinestones are very good! At first glance I do not see any chipped rhinestones or discoloration. They are all shiny and bright and I don&#x27;t see anything to complain about. There are no color repeats in each wheel and since all wheels are a different selection type there are no repeats between wheels either!&lt;br /&gt;As for amount of rhinestones in each wheel, they are not filled to the top of the wheel (which is not a bad thing since if they were you&#x27;d have a hard time turning wheels and not mixing colors while you do it) but they are sufficiently full (about 50%-80% depending on the size of the rhinestone. For example the large pearl wheel looks fuller than the one with the smallest round rhinestones). I will not do a count since that&#x27;s just tedious and boring but I can say there may be what I estimate to be 40-50 stones in each section. I feel this is more than enough to last me many manicures with all the different colors and varieties. If you&#x27;d like to see the wheels for yourself please see the photos I post!&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;d like to see the colors of the rhinestones I&#x27;ve received please take a look at the photos as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I LOVE this product. I have no complaints about it and I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a colorful rhinestone set with not only round stones but stones in different shapes too (not to mention a soft touch of pearls if you get sick of using that much bling). It&#x27;s precisely which I chose this bundle to purchase since most bundles have mostly white/silver rhinestones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hoped my review will help you make a good purchase!it worked that role pretty well.

    <li> I ordered this set on December 2, 2013 and received it december 17, 2013. It arrived nicely packaged with bubble wrap in a little yellow heavy duty envelope. Each wheel was individually packaged in its own little plastic bag. The wheels are smaller than I expected them to be. They look nice from the top where you see all the gems and compartments, but there are no pictures from the seller of the side of the wheels, which are quite small and thin (so the compartments of each wheel aren&#x27;t all that deep and won&#x27;t fit as many gems as each compartment appears to contain in the picture. If you&#x27;re expecting a regular sized wheel, these are a bit smaller in comparison. However, for the price, I can&#x27;t complain. Of the six wheels, two of them contained the same sized plastic pearls, but I was hoping for different sizes. In addition to that, some of the gems in the wheel with different shaped gems were a different shape and color than pictured. I got triangle ones and bow shaped ones that weren&#x27;t in the picture. Overall, nice product. Just don&#x27;t expect too much for the price.</li>
    <li> The rhinestones not variety.. I only got the circle one 3 box with 2 different size, 2 box of pearl with same size, and one box of rhinestones that look like tears.. The glue also only 1/5 from the bottle size.. Seriously dissapointed</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not happy with the shipping, or the way they did, took a month to send it to the end to receive a product that has half of the wheel boxes, empty. Neither dont&#x27;n send me: the glue, and 2x dotting pens to work with this material.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nice, but I get frustration when I saw most of the boxes with very little material.&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend¡¡¡</li>
    <li> The little gems and pearls are nice, but the glue arrived empty or dry. One of the dotting sticks was broken. I had to go pay $3 to get glue when I should of had it with this package. So definitely disappointed.</li>
    <li> if you love doing your own nails like me this is a great product it comes with many colors different shapes and sizes. The rhinestones are easy to put on with the pen that comes with it. I would have gave it 5 stars but the glue sucks but i got some super nail glue and the rhinstones stayed on for a whole month!</li>
    <li> Seriously, you can&#x27;t want more for this price: good quality rhinestones and pearls, a beautiful array of colors and bonus items. This is a must buy if you&#x27;re interested in buying rhinestone wheels.</li>
    <li> The wheels are super small and doesn&#x27;t come with enough in each to do what I wanted with them. ..</li>
    <li> These were a great buy and will be purchasing more when I run out they were beautiful and easy to order. They also came in quickly I was pleased.</li>
    <li> Its very small kitbut is cute!!</li>
    <li> Everything was just as pictured. I actually bought these to use around my eyes, so I won&#x27;t be using the nail glue. But I like that there was a wide variety of options and actually came with more in the little tubs than I was expecting for the price. I also already have dotting tools, so those will just be extra for what I have.</li>
    <li> downsides: the glue, but you dont really need it. one of the dotting pens came apart but is easily fixed with some glue.&lt;br /&gt;overall satisfied with the rhinestones &amp; dotting pens!</li>
    <li> it is nice and good one i like them it comes with 6 Wheels Combo Set Nail Art Nailart Manicure Rhinestones Glitter Tips Deco + 2x Dotting Pen + Glue</li>
    <li> The price is unbeatable, Awesome product, glue is super strong!!! love the small dotting tools and the variety of stones. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> i use it on my cousin, and it looks so cute.. the dotting tool is a plus :) cant wait to do more wonderful designs with these :)</li>
    <li> I absolutely love them! They are true to what is in the picture and were delivered sooner than estimated.  They&#x27;re prefect &amp; I get so many compliments on my nails.  I definitely recommend them! :) (I got the glue as well just not in my picture).</li>
    <li> Great starter set like the different types of rhinestones, dotting tools helps make the perfect circle fit and the glue is appreciated. Price &amp; delivery time pretty good too. Thanks</li>
    <li> i received my package and automatically i noticed the two dotting tools were missing and the glue was practically empty. I don&#x27;t recommend this unless they do ship the things I paid for to me again.</li>
    <li> Got 3 of each wheel, not 6 different wheels, but they look nice and the tools work well</li>
    <li> Lots of cute nail bling!</li>
    <li> My daughter has started a faze with nail art and ordered this kit. She has been using it ever since she received it. She likes it very much.</li>
    <li> we just received them and already i am blinging out my sweeties nails...  the only thing negative worth mentioning is that there is no different sizes of gems...  they are all the 2mm size but for being so small they still dazzle on her nails!</li>
    <li> Awesome products, just wish it was a little quicker ship time but thanks anyway!!! I will reorder when needed, thanks again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m slightly disappointed with the quantity of stones I received .... only 1 wheel was full, like in the picture and it was only a half bottle of glue. It did arrive before expected but again the quantity was NOT like the picture.Considering it was only a few bucks ....I guess you get what you pay for!</li>
