      <li>anyone know of a better brand?.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I made sure I would have this item for a while by purchasing 2 in the Espresso and 2 in the Onyx.</li>
      <li>I hope I&#x27;ll still be able to find this again when I run out.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s better as a water liner.</li>
      <li>I love the consistency and it does help lashes grow.</li>
      <li>I love the this product and have worn it for years.</li>
      <li>Love them.</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly and richly with a gorgeous color.</li>
      <li>I had purchased this item years ago when it was first introduced and loved it.</li>
      <li>I love how it glides on easy but</li>
      <li>love the way it glides on smoothly.</li>
      <li>it smears easy and with sweat or rain or what</li>
      <li>Goes on smoothly without any tugging or pulling.</li>
      <li>I have no idea if this stuff actually has any effect on eyelash length, but it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
      <li>The liner glides on for a smooth application.</li>
      <li>This product goes on with the slightest touch, smooth and gel-like.</li>
      <li>Glides on smoothly.  </li>
      <li>Sometimes this liner does smudge if you don&#x27;t use a little powder first, but over all I LOVE the consistency, the silky texture, and gorgeous color!</li>
      <li>.. Goes on like a sweet cream spread on toast.  </li>
      <li>I liked how soft the pencil is...</li>
      <li>Many people go for black eyeliner because it gives a more striking appearance, but it may not work for their features well.</li>
      <li>If you use it sparingly on the top lashline only it is okay</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t mind that much since it makes the eyes look more intense that way ;)</li>
      <li>However, The pencil itself doesn&#x27;t work right.</li>
      <li>just right</li>
      <li>not, will smear right all over your face.  </li>
      <li>The main reason I enjoy this liner is the consistency.</li>
      <li>I really like this eyeliner, so when I saw this deal on Amazon, I snatched it right up!  </li>
      <li>I found this eyeliner to be fantastic and recently ordered several more (love it so much</li>
      <li>Very intense color.</li>
      <li>I have been using it a lot and they seem the same to me, but I love the product as eyeliner.</li>
      <li>This is a nice eyeliner with a wonderful rich color, however, it is awful if you wear contacts.</li>
      <li>It goes on very smooth and stays on for a long time.  </li>
      <li>Its very greasy</li>
      <li>Nothing to note that hasn&#x27;t been noted except on the color itself: If you look up swatches online, the color itself will be much lighter than what you will see in person, maybe because those pictures use flash.</li>
      <li>I ordered back and got espresso... not cost effective to send back</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t really used it so much to have noticed anything about the long-term health of my eyelashes or anything, but it feels better on than any other eyeliner I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it improved the growth of my lashes because I already have pretty full lashes, but at my age, I figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try something that would keep my lashes healthy for as long as I could.</li>
      <li>The color is a nice, very dark brown (almost black) and it goes on really smoothly.</li>
      <li>Somewhat of a darker brown than I had expected, but still a fantastic product.</li>
      <li>Otherwise it does not cause any irritation, is easy to apply (especially in the inner eye) and is purported to help eyelash growth.</li>
      <li>The first time I used it I accidentally put too much on but that was probably because my other lines do not transfer as much color as this product.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not too dark and not too light.  </li>
      <li>I have really sensitive skin, and I dont break out with these.</li>
      <li>This liner goes on smoother than any that I have tried so far</li>
      <li>If it gets anywhere near your waterline it will cause your contacts to film over completely.</li>
      <li>The added bonus is that it stays put longer which is important to me as I have slightly oily eye lids (where eye liners disappear shortly after I put them on).</li>
      <li>I really enjoy this color (especially with black mascara) because despite having darker features (brown eyes and hair, olive skin), the espresso color gives me a softer, \\&quot;come hither\\&quot; allure without making me look like a hussy.</li>
      <li>Unlike a normal pencil, this eyeliner glides on (similar to liquid, but with the control of a pencil).</li>
      <li>was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, this and the last three pencils I have purchased are completely useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Super product for an unbelievable price!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> love the way it glides on smoothly. but why is it discontinued by Revlon? its the best liner i have ever found. It stays on although it does smudge if you are very active and sweaty.</li>
    <li> This product goes on with the slightest touch, smooth and gel-like. Very intense color. The best eyeliner I have ever purchased! If it should become available in the mechanical pencil that would be the perfect one for me. Will use this until Revlon no longer supplies it.</li>
    <li> I wish they still sold this in the stores.  It&#x27;s the only eyeliner that doesn&#x27;t run and doesn&#x27;t wear off.  I bought 4 at once so I don&#x27;t have to wait when it&#x27;s time to reorder.</li>
    <li> This is a very dark brown, almost a black-brown. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it staying in place. Goes on smoothly without any tugging or pulling. Stays in place for 8+ hours, give or take. Works for me!</li>
    <li> I had purchased this item years ago when it was first introduced and loved it. It applied very smoothly and didn&#x27;t flake or smudge. I&#x27;m not sure if it improved the growth of my lashes because I already have pretty full lashes, but at my age, I figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try something that would keep my lashes healthy for as long as I could. I was so disappointed when I tried to purchase this again in the stores since it was discontinued but very thankful that I could still find it online. I made sure I would have this item for a while by purchasing 2 in the Espresso and 2 in the Onyx. I hope I&#x27;ll still be able to find this again when I run out.</li>
    <li> Every drug store around me does not carry this eyeliner anymore.  Thank god I can find it on Amazon :)  This is one of my best eyeliners I have ever used.  I wear eyeliner every day and it is a personal make up staple.  This one does not smudge - or smudges just right if that&#x27;s the look you are going for.  I also love this color Espresso... it&#x27;s not too dark and not too light.  It gives a glimmer of goldish-metallic-brown which is subtle but adds a little something extra to my face and eyes.</li>
    <li> best color--- the almost-black-shade-of-brown.. Goes on like a sweet cream spread on toast.  Stays on my eyes all day. I love this product to bits!! I liked how soft the pencil is...it goes on like liquid eyeliner but has the control of a pencil.  I am not sure if it makes my lashes healthier. I have been using it a lot and they seem the same to me, but I love the product as eyeliner.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright. It smudges when I wear it on my lids, but it&#x27;s a nice brown. It&#x27;s better as a water liner. It&#x27;s also a pain to sharpen.</li>
    <li> I first bought this eyeliner a few months ago when I couldn&#x27;t find a pencil in the dark brown color I like. I found this eyeliner to be fantastic and recently ordered several more (love it so much, worried what I will do if I can&#x27;t find it anymore!). Unlike a normal pencil, this eyeliner glides on (similar to liquid, but with the control of a pencil). Sometimes this liner does smudge if you don&#x27;t use a little powder first, but over all I LOVE the consistency, the silky texture, and gorgeous color!</li>
    <li> I have tried several eye pencils this is the best yet. Hard to find at stors but thank goodness Amazon had it</li>
    <li> This liner is great. I love the this product and have worn it for years. It is discontinued at the stores in my area. So happy to find it at Amazon.</li>
    <li> This eye liner doesn&#x27;t stay on long... it smears easy and with sweat or rain or what not, will smear right all over your face.  I love how it glides on easy but what a mess!  I wont buy again.</li>
    <li> This is a nice eyeliner with a wonderful rich color, however, it is awful if you wear contacts. If it gets anywhere near your waterline it will cause your contacts to film over completely. I&#x27;ve used dozens of eyeliners over the years and I&#x27;ve never experienced that. I was nearly blind till I could get home and clean my lenses. If you use it sparingly on the top lashline only it is okay but there are other liners you don&#x27;t need to be so careful with.</li>
    <li> Love the beautiful color and the creaminess of the pencil.. Love it loads! Great product! Does smudge after a while but I don&#x27;t mind that much since it makes the eyes look more intense that way ;)</li>
    <li> I have no idea if this stuff actually has any effect on eyelash length, but it&#x27;s a great product. The color is a nice, very dark brown (almost black) and it goes on really smoothly. I don&#x27;t have problems with it bleeding or rubbing off. I&#x27;ve bought it several times and will continue to do so!</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE.  Lashes are longer and fuller.  I dread the day I run out of this.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner goes on very smoothly, but runs throughout the day.</li>
    <li> The main reason I enjoy this liner is the consistency. The liner glides on for a smooth application. If you are looking for a liner that is easily blended and creamy, this is the one!</li>
    <li> very nice quality.  It goes on very smooth and stays on for a long time.  I would recommend this product</li>
    <li> It goes on smoothly and richly with a gorgeous color. I haven&#x27;t really used it so much to have noticed anything about the long-term health of my eyelashes or anything, but it feels better on than any other eyeliner I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I found the liner goes on my eyes very smoothly. I liked the liner. The first time I used it I accidentally put too much on but that was probably because my other lines do not transfer as much color as this product.</li>
    <li> I had been these for years. Love them. It lasts all day for me.  I have really sensitive skin, and I dont break out with these.</li>
    <li> I love the consistency and it does help lashes grow.</li>
    <li> I ordered back and got espresso... not cost effective to send back</li>
    <li> I like the liner, and the shipping and service were prompt, including a &amp;#34;bonus&amp;#34; lip gloss. However, The pencil itself doesn&#x27;t work right. It will not twist up when I turn the mechanism. I have to get the pencil cold (so it doesn&#x27;t mush),  pull the bottom off, and stick something in the back to push it up manually.</li>
    <li> This liner goes on smoother than any that I have tried so far and it lasts all day. Somewhat of a darker brown than I had expected, but still a fantastic product.</li>
    <li> Its very greasy and i seldom use it for my oily lids.</li>
    <li> Glides on smoothly.  Silky crayon-like tip that you can sharpen to your preference of point.  Can&#x27;t find in stores anymore - was thrilled that I could buy online so I bought a few.</li>
    <li> I am soooo sick of buying eyeliners that do not work.  They are supposed to extend.  But, they don&#x27;t.  You can&#x27;t sharpen or twist to extend them.  I got so mad at this one that I broke it open to see if there was actually eyeliner inside.  There was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, this and the last three pencils I have purchased are completely useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does anyone know of a better brand?.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Revlon really needs to stop selling this crap.</li>
    <li> I really like this eyeliner, so when I saw this deal on Amazon, I snatched it right up!  Super product for an unbelievable price!</li>
    <li> This is an inexpensive eye liner that performs like more expensive brands.  The added bonus is that it stays put longer which is important to me as I have slightly oily eye lids (where eye liners disappear shortly after I put them on).</li>
    <li> Received a nail kit with fingernail polish all over the box. Had to pay for shipping and didn&#x27;t get the correct item. Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> Nothing to note that hasn&#x27;t been noted except on the color itself: If you look up swatches online, the color itself will be much lighter than what you will see in person, maybe because those pictures use flash. The color itself is a dark dark brown almost black...basically like what espresso would look like, hence the name. Many people go for black eyeliner because it gives a more striking appearance, but it may not work for their features well. I really enjoy this color (especially with black mascara) because despite having darker features (brown eyes and hair, olive skin), the espresso color gives me a softer, \\&quot;come hither\\&quot; allure without making me look like a hussy. Unless you&#x27;re into that sort of thing.</li>
    <li> I would have given this 5 stars except that it can smear. Otherwise it does not cause any irritation, is easy to apply (especially in the inner eye) and is purported to help eyelash growth. I wish there were colours such as Aubergine or Plum. Still an excellent product.[[ASIN:B004O3YD8Y Revlon Grow Luscious Lash Liner, Espresso, 0.04 Ounce]]</li>
    <li> Use with an eye primer.</li>
