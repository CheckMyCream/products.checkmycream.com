### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It feels quite wonderful on my non-sensitive areas.</li>
      <li>It works beautifully!</li>
      <li>best thing about this product is that I don&#x27;t need to moisturize with it!</li>
      <li>So I tried Watery which is perfect for me.</li>
      <li>This product is very good.</li>
      <li>Very nice BB cream very light yet has great coverage for even the darkest of spots.</li>
      <li>The shade of this was good with my fair olive skin tone.</li>
      <li>Smells good, matches my face color.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s a good makeup for going out at night or staying indoors.</li>
      <li>I love it it to pieces!</li>
      <li>It smells amazing.</li>
      <li>It’s a kind of scent that I would smell in any moisturizer.</li>
      <li>It goes on really nice and it makes it</li>
      <li>This is nice for all over face coverage though.</li>
      <li>love love it!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not a fan on the dewy finish, but a bit of powder on top with a duo-fiber brush after it has set deals with that nicely.</li>
      <li>This product is by far the best BB cream I have ever had.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t work great on my skin tone but it looked great on my teenage daughter.</li>
      <li>I was hoping this was going to be a very light weight, skin like appearance but</li>
      <li>If you have very fair skin, this may work for you but it made my face look really washed out and too light.</li>
      <li>Waaay better than anything I&#x27;ve tried in the States.  </li>
      <li>this wasn&#x27;t scented it would be my favorite foundation, but the scent gave me a long-lasting headache every day that I wore the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not in love with it.</li>
      <li>I looks more clumpy overtime when under mineral powder.</li>
      <li>I also love the smell.</li>
      <li>I have porcelain white skin, and this bb creme is perfect for me!</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I love it thank you :)</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve been wearing this for more than a month without any issues.</li>
      <li>Someone else mentioned that it&#x27;s more brown/pink toned</li>
      <li>so I guess if you have acne of something you might be able to cover it,</li>
      <li>my face looks and feels better than ever.</li>
      <li>but it does pretty good with redness.</li>
      <li>Matches my very fair skin tone without adding the orangey tint I&#x27;ve found in many American beauty products.</li>
      <li>Easily smooths on.</li>
      <li>the coverage is pretty decent for how nicely this bb goes on, it&#x27;s not as good as skin79&#x27;s vip gold in terms of cover-up</li>
      <li>If you have tolerated scented cosmetics in the past and have fair neutral-ish skin, this could be a great find.</li>
      <li>’s fine for my skin.</li>
      <li>so I use Etude House Cotton Fit for that or The Face Shop Aura CC.</li>
      <li>It blends so smoothly on my skin and basically adjusts to my skin tone.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a great BB cream I would definitely recommend this.</li>
      <li>My new favorite BB Cream!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty much in love with this (holika petit watery) bb cream.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff and definitely will be buying more :)</li>
      <li>I switched to bare minerals bare skin and LOVE it!!!</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t give me seamless pores but good enough for possibly candid pictures.</li>
      <li>I have an oily T-zone and found that it stayed true in consistency all day with no color changing, I was also happy that I had no bleeding from my mascara or eyeliner even at the very end of my long days.</li>
      <li>It wears really well and is really easy to apply.</li>
      <li>The watery bb cream is really good for dry skin.</li>
      <li>Since this is a more liquidy cream I would recommend this for people with more dry skin like mine.</li>
      <li>It makes your face feel so fresh.</li>
      <li>I have temperamental skin which can have reactions to certain ingredients and this product was light, fresh, and gentle to my skin.</li>
      <li>product is a bit more brown/pink toned than the Essential, but under fluorescent lights looks more natural on my skin.</li>
      <li>I was hesitant at first to try this, but I decided it was worth a try.</li>
      <li>the smell is pretty strong but not too overwhelming and dissipates within a few minutes after application, it really just smells like a mild flowery perfume.</li>
      <li>Still worked pretty well</li>
      <li>First BB cream i have tried</li>
      <li>The first time I purchased this in Moisture.</li>
      <li>I tried so many products and they all didn&#x27;t work or caused my skin to dry out faster than it already is or break out.</li>
      <li>This is good for everyday coverage for people with normal skin conditions.</li>
      <li>While it&#x27;s very moisturizing, I found it to be much too opaque in coverage.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t cover up much as compared to the off brand rite aide stuff I use.</li>
      <li>recently i purchase a bunch of different bb&#x27;s to see if anything could come close to my skin79 favorite go-to&#x27;s and out of 2 skinfoods, holika aqua jelly and the only skin79 i hadnt tried before, this holika petit watery bb cream is my favorite from the lot</li>
      <li>I just use my pointer finger to dab and pat it on gently.</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t really have that issue often -knock</li>
      <li>Light sheer coverage.</li>
      <li>you really can&#x27;t beat the price either.</li>
      <li>I chose the watery version of this BB Cream because I liked the fact that it contained Green Tea</li>
      <li>However, the foundation contains a strong fragrance and the fragrance lasts just as long as the rest of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This BB offers a little less coverage than the others but its still great if you just want light coverage.</li>
      <li>The only downside to this product is how the tube isn&#x27;t even full.</li>
      <li>it is a bit on the pinkish side which i&#x27;m not crazy about, but I can live with it, you can only see the pinkness in real sunlight</li>
      <li>Also, there&#x27;s a strong scent that the other Petit BB creams don&#x27;t have.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not thick, but lasts for all day.</li>
      <li>It works for some people though and the price is pretty cheap with a small amount (30ml) of product that you can toss out if you really don&#x27;t like it or use it on your arms/feet for the spf protection.</li>
      <li>Normally when I wear any type of face makeup for more than a few days it begins to break me out</li>
      <li>and I did need to use slightly more than Moisture, but this bottle will still last a long time.</li>
      <li>Not much of the product is needed for full coverage and it feels really lightweight on my face.</li>
      <li>but like most bb&#x27;s a tiny bit goes a long way.</li>
      <li>and I use it pretty much daily.</li>
      <li>I bought my first bottle back in like October.</li>
      <li>This exceeded all of my expectations, the consistency provides good coverage without being heavy, even under my moderately dark circles.</li>
      <li>Then I tried it again only at a certain area and got another pimple &#x3D;.&#x3D;</li>
      <li>/&gt;Steer clear if you get scent headaches sometimes.</li>
      <li>This product had a medium or build-able coverage and finished really naturally.</li>
      <li>Does keep my face moisturised and soft.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t know about that, but I&#x27;ll probably be ordering it again even though it took nearly a month to get here.</li>
      <li>The other BB creams did not break me out, but within the first day of using this one, 2 pimples showed up (on my cheeks</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very hard to put too much of this product on, as it&#x27;s pretty low-coverage, but it evens out the moderate rosacea I have to a decent degree for a natural look, if not a slightly dewy look.</li>
      <li>not nearly as pink as the holika aqua petit jelly</li>
      <li>Like so many of the other comments, a little goes a long way.</li>
      <li>The bottle is really small, but to me it&#x27;s worth it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> If you have very fair skin, this may work for you but it made my face look really washed out and too light.</li>
    <li> I have been slowly changing some of the products that I have been using and am ecstatic to have found this little gem! I chose the watery version of this BB Cream because I liked the fact that it contained Green Tea and although I wanted coverage I also wanted something that was unnoticeable to the touch or eyes. This exceeded all of my expectations, the consistency provides good coverage without being heavy, even under my moderately dark circles. I have temperamental skin which can have reactions to certain ingredients and this product was light, fresh, and gentle to my skin. There is a subtle fragrance but mainly from the ingredients so it is not very strong. I have an oily T-zone and found that it stayed true in consistency all day with no color changing, I was also happy that I had no bleeding from my mascara or eyeliner even at the very end of my long days. This has now become a staple in my daily makeup routine!</li>
    <li> Very nice BB cream very light yet has great coverage for even the darkest of spots. I recommend! love love it!</li>
    <li> This product had a medium or build-able coverage and finished really naturally. The shade of this was good with my fair olive skin tone. It was a pale neutral color, not obviously pink or yellow, nor did it oxidize to orange. The foundation lasts all day even if I didn&#x27;t powder my face and applied easily no matter if i used a brush, sponge, or my hands. However, the foundation contains a strong fragrance and the fragrance lasts just as long as the rest of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this wasn&#x27;t scented it would be my favorite foundation, but the scent gave me a long-lasting headache every day that I wore the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steer clear if you get scent headaches sometimes. If you have tolerated scented cosmetics in the past and have fair neutral-ish skin, this could be a great find.</li>
    <li> I love it thank you :)</li>
    <li> This product is very good. It smells amazing. It&#x27;s not thick, but lasts for all day.</li>
    <li> It works just like its suppose to.</li>
    <li> Matches my very fair skin tone without adding the orangey tint I&#x27;ve found in many American beauty products. Smells faintly perfumey but wasn&#x27;t strong enough to bother me. Normally when I wear any type of face makeup for more than a few days it begins to break me out but I&#x27;ve been wearing this for more than a month without any issues. This BB offers a little less coverage than the others but its still great if you just want light coverage.</li>
    <li> The watery bb cream is really good for dry skin. It moisturizes your skin all day after application. I also love the smell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty much in love with this (holika petit watery) bb cream. It&#x27;s really thin and light, gives just enough coverage and doesn&#x27;t cake up. it is a bit on the pinkish side which i&#x27;m not crazy about, but I can live with it, you can only see the pinkness in real sunlight so it&#x27;s a good makeup for going out at night or staying indoors. not nearly as pink as the holika aqua petit jelly no2.&lt;br /&gt;after a while your t-zone does tend to get a bit oily, but it hasn&#x27;t made me break out, and when my skin is &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; it&#x27;s not really enough to notice/bother me. the smell is pretty strong but not too overwhelming and dissipates within a few minutes after application, it really just smells like a mild flowery perfume. the coverage is pretty decent for how nicely this bb goes on, it&#x27;s not as good as skin79&#x27;s vip gold in terms of cover-up but it does pretty good with redness. it&#x27;s buildable so I guess if you have acne of something you might be able to cover it, but I don&#x27;t really have that issue often -knock on wood-.  recently i purchase a bunch of different bb&#x27;s to see if anything could come close to my skin79 favorite go-to&#x27;s and out of 2 skinfoods, holika aqua jelly and the only skin79 i hadnt tried before, this holika petit watery bb cream is my favorite from the lot and I use it pretty much daily. you really can&#x27;t beat the price either. i&#x27;m expecting this bottle to last about 6 months - this tube is 30g, usually my 40g skin79 lasts about 10months-1 year.... 6 months might be pushing it since I&#x27;ve been wearing it every day though, but like most bb&#x27;s a tiny bit goes a long way. I&#x27;ll definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t cover up much as compared to the off brand rite aide stuff I use. Still worked pretty well, I think I&#x27;m going to try a different one if I buy it again.</li>
    <li> Someone else mentioned that it&#x27;s more brown/pink toned and I agree. It is a bit unnatural looking compared to the other Holika Holika Petit BB creams. The texture is a little runny and it doesn&#x27;t work for my sensitive skin. The other BB creams did not break me out, but within the first day of using this one, 2 pimples showed up (on my cheeks and I usually only get them on my temples or chin). I immediately stopped using it and went back to some other BB creams and the pimples went away after a few days. Then I tried it again only at a certain area and got another pimple &#x3D;.&#x3D; Also, there&#x27;s a strong scent that the other Petit BB creams don&#x27;t have. So, I minus 1 star for the scent and 1 star for the irriation. It works for some people though and the price is pretty cheap with a small amount (30ml) of product that you can toss out if you really don&#x27;t like it or use it on your arms/feet for the spf protection. It feels quite wonderful on my non-sensitive areas.</li>
    <li> This is the only bb creme or foundation or facial correcting tint blah blah blah to not look powdery or get stuck in the creases, etc. It works beautifully! I have porcelain white skin, and this bb creme is perfect for me! (Caucasian white). It wears really well and is really easy to apply. I just use my pointer finger to dab and pat it on gently. It doesn&#x27;t give me any sort of pimples or negative reactions so this is a home run for me!!! &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I love it it to pieces! My new favorite BB Cream!</li>
    <li> The first time I purchased this in Moisture. While it&#x27;s very moisturizing, I found it to be much too opaque in coverage. I&#x27;m one of those people who just needs a tad bit of base to even me out and most US brands either give me an orange cast, are too dark, or have an annoying cloying fragrance.  So I tried Watery which is perfect for me. The formula still feels creamy and I did need to use slightly more than Moisture, but this bottle will still last a long time. The look, feel, and fragrance of both are 10/10. Waaay better than anything I&#x27;ve tried in the States.  Not recommended for anyone tan or of darker skin tone.</li>
    <li> I bought my first bottle back in like October. It blends so smoothly on my skin and basically adjusts to my skin tone. Not much of the product is needed for full coverage and it feels really lightweight on my face. This tiny bottle has lasted me a long time already. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> This is good for everyday coverage for people with normal skin conditions. Normal as in non-severe acne, maybe a few visible pores here and there but not giant craters of pores, and low discoloration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s fine for my skin. I think it’s alright. It doesn&#x27;t give me seamless pores but good enough for possibly candid pictures. I can scratch my face and none of the cream goes into my fingernails. I would use it for everyday. It gives off a scent but it doesn’t stink. It’s a kind of scent that I would smell in any moisturizer. I&#x27;m not in love with it. Maybe I bought the wrong BB cream. I guess I&#x27;ll try the pink one instead next time.</li>
    <li> While I like the product because it is thicker than the Watery Petit BB, it was a bit darker for my pale skin tone. I looks more clumpy overtime when under mineral powder.</li>
    <li> I tried this product and the Essential formula. I prefer this one in my office environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a bit more brown/pink toned than the Essential, but under fluorescent lights looks more natural on my skin. It&#x27;s very hard to put too much of this product on, as it&#x27;s pretty low-coverage, but it evens out the moderate rosacea I have to a decent degree for a natural look, if not a slightly dewy look. I&#x27;m not a fan on the dewy finish, but a bit of powder on top with a duo-fiber brush after it has set deals with that nicely. It does take a long time to set, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing about this product is that I don&#x27;t need to moisturize with it! My skin feels silky even after I take it off, and I have very extremely sensitive, extremely combination skin, I get neither dry patches nor blemishes with this, and I will continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> This product is by far the best BB cream I have ever had. I tried so many products and they all didn&#x27;t work or caused my skin to dry out faster than it already is or break out. I was hesitant at first to try this, but I decided it was worth a try. I got this in January and now in June my face looks and feels better than ever. It makes your face feel so fresh. Like so many of the other comments, a little goes a long way. I got this in January and still have almost half a tube left and I wear it almost everyday. If you&#x27;re looking for a great BB cream I would definitely recommend this. But everyone&#x27;s skin is different; so to me it works so well but for others it might not. Since this is a more liquidy cream I would recommend this for people with more dry skin like mine. It helps the dryness and makes your face glow! Love this stuff and definitely will be buying more :)</li>
    <li> I was hoping this was going to be a very light weight, skin like appearance but the color is a little off and it does not last all day.  I switched to bare minerals bare skin and LOVE it!!!</li>
    <li> First BB cream i have tried but now it will be my makeup staple. Light sheer coverage. Easily smooths on. A little goes a long way. Affordable.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work great on my skin tone but it looked great on my teenage daughter.</li>
    <li> Smells good, matches my face color. I&#x27;m a pale girl, and when I put this on it immediately matches to my face tone and evened it out - it also minimized the look of my pores. The only downside to this product is how the tube isn&#x27;t even full. I only used it twice - very minimally (a little goes a long way) - and I found it hard to get more out. Don&#x27;t know about that, but I&#x27;ll probably be ordering it again even though it took nearly a month to get here. It is, so far, the only BB cream that works for my pale skin.</li>
    <li> Bought the green one. Does keep my face moisturised and soft. I love this product.</li>
    <li> The bottle is really small, but to me it&#x27;s worth it. It goes on really nice and it makes it so I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing a lot of heavy makeup. It doesn&#x27;t cover up the dark circles under my eyes so I use Etude House Cotton Fit for that or The Face Shop Aura CC. This is nice for all over face coverage though.</li>
