    <li> Absolute junk that smells as bad as it works. Over priced network marketing company representatives selling their free supplies to get back their investment because it does not work as advertised. Product does not work period DO YOUR RESEARCH, smells bad and for the money you could buy several other products that work better.</li>
    <li> My skin definitely looks better.</li>
    <li> I have used this before, really like it</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> This product is very true to it word, you can really see visible fine lines fade away.</li>
    <li> I feel like the bottle was not full even though it had a plastic piece on it.  Are these refilled bottles?  It does not come out of the bottle very well and feels like it is empty even though I have only used it a couple of times.  Very disappointed and I will not be ordering it again.</li>
    <li> Been using this for over a year and refuse to be without it! Miracle stuff.</li>
    <li> Good product but simply too expensive for me to keep up with.</li>
    <li> My skin has been felling amazing, you can tell its texture has definitely change!</li>
    <li> Product is not what is pictured or described. Contacted seller and received no return email. Extremely disappointed.</li>
    <li> My wife just loves your product</li>
    <li> Love this stuff it&#x27;s the only thing that works for me</li>
    <li> I love Nerium, it does very well on my skin.</li>
    <li> I was so impressed with the product that I started selling it. It is a great product. The first week I saw a big difference the lines in my face. After a week it has not worked as fast but it is still working well. So far the product has exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Too expensive, I feel guilty about it, but it works so I find the money.</li>
    <li> Poor packaging bought as new item when received the bottle was used and almost empty. If I could give zero stars it would.</li>
    <li> I like this product. I&#x27;m on my second bottle. First I apply RetinA. The. I dampen my face and pat on about 4 pumps of the Nerium. My dermotologist thought that that was a good way to apply it. I have some places on my face that are   finally whitening.  We&#x27;ll let u know!</li>
    <li> I love this product! I have been using it for a year and a half and I have seen a big difference in how my skin looks. It has tightened my skin and has reduced my wrinkles. I use it on my neck and I look younger. It does have a slight earthy smell but it doesn&#x27;t bother me! I would recommend it...</li>
    <li> If you use this product the way it&#x27;s intended it works. Believe me I&#x27;ve tried everything. You have to dampen your skin and apply it and then wash it off in the morning.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome for me.</li>
    <li> Fast Shipping! Product was Brand New!</li>
