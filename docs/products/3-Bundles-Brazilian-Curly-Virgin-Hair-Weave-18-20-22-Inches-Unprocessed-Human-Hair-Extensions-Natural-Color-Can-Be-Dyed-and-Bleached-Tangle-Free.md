    <li> I love the hair its sooooo soft pictures of me wit the hair will be coming soon its not nappy and it do not Pull out when u r comb the hair wit your fingers</li>
    <li> Will never order this again, fixed it once.sheds a lot, smells but not so bad.  The shedding has reduced it to nothing.  Crap</li>
    <li> I have still not I stalled the hair but I have washed it and it didn&#x27;t shed. It looked short to me at first so I contacted the distributor and they emailed me back right away addressing my concerns with the hair. ... Which I greatly appreciated</li>
    <li> The hair is so soft and I also received bonus eyelashes which is an added plus! Also, the bundles are full and will be enough for a full head.  I will definitely purchase hair from this seller again. :)</li>
    <li> Well I dyed this &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; and it basically melted lbvs. It was really pretty when I first got it but my natural hair isn&#x27;t black so I decided to change the color of the weave and it changed but this is definitely not human hair. If you decide to buy it don&#x27;t dye it even though it says you can in the description!</li>
    <li> I really like the hair and it was more than enough for my whole head; wished it came with an enclosure; I didn&#x27;t use it all. My only issue was -it was jet black and smelled. With a few washes the smell went away. I had to dye it which I had to use a 40vol bleach to get it to lighten a little. I wish it came in a natural color. Other than that I liked the hair.</li>
    <li> I finally installed my hair after a week of having it. This curl pattern doesn&#x27;t really fit me.I think I should have gotten the bundles the same length. The hair has a strong processed smell to it. I washed it. The smell didn&#x27;t go away. I plan to flat iron it one it dries. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this hair again due to the smell. But other than that it&#x27;s pretty decent.</li>
    <li> Beautiful soft and very natural looking. I don&#x27;t handle hair nicely but this has held up for almost three months. Just a little moisturizer and trimming of frizzy ends and it&#x27;s back looking great.</li>
    <li> I really like the hair it is really soft.  I will wash it  and condition it before the install! Can&#x27;t wait!üòäüëç I like the fact that I received an extra bonus eyelashes! Thank you Vendor!</li>
    <li> Did a burn test, it passed! Straightened it, it was perfect and went back to the curl one wet! Hardly any shedding or tangles! The lowest maintenance hair I&#x27;ve ever had! Love it! Brushed it out and wore it big, straightened it and wore it straight, wore it wet, etc! It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Has a weird smell other then that I love it</li>
    <li> This hair is amazing i would buy it again!!!!</li>
    <li> give to my daughter, she liked the hair.</li>
    <li> Hair still looks pretty and curly after 30day installing I&#x27;ve washed and died this hair with bleach no issues will huy again fron this seller</li>
    <li> Just wasn&#x27;t the texture I though it would be and you can&#x27;t really flat iron it</li>
    <li> I ordered at 14,16 &amp; 18 inch. I am very satisfied with this product it did smell a little funny when i took it out of the package but the smell went away. I bleached this hair and wasn&#x27;t satisfied after the first bleach but i bleached again and now im very satisfied. I would recommend this product. Will upload more pictures after install. The picture on top left was as soon as i took it out of package the second is after i bleached first time the last two on bottom are after 2nd bleach.</li>
