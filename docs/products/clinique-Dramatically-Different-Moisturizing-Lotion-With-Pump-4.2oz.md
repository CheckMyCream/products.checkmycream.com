      <li>For very good, Conforming our specific skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll continue to use this seller because the size of this bottle costs $10 to $15 more in department stores, plus the shipping was free.  </li>
      <li>good product and fast delivary</li>
      <li>I never tried the original formula, so I can&#x27;t comment on whether it was better.</li>

      <li>I liked the older version more, but decided to try the newer version.</li>
      <li>I will not be purchasing it again because of this as well as the fact that this product is not that great for you skin (too many chemicals, not natural) and in my opinion, this out ways the benefits of using it.</li>

      <li>I bought a 2oz sample from ebay and liked it so much</li>
      <li>Smooth texture and glow.  </li>
      <li>I so wish Clinique would continue to offer the original to those who want to continue using it.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s no reason there can&#x27;t be an original formula and a plus formula.</li>
      <li>Like many others, I used the original formula for many, many years and considered it an essential.  </li>
      <li>It makes your skin feel great and it lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>Great price and with my super sensitive skin, I&#x27;m willing to buy whatever works.</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly and great moisturizer for my dry skin.</li>
      <li>, I purchased a full size.</li>
      <li>I was a loyal user for over 10 years and my mother also.  </li>
      <li>I washed it off quickly and I would not recommend this to anyone or purchase this ever again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is very moisturizing and good for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>you first put it on, you will notice that it no longer feels lightweight or smooth.</li>
      <li>I do believe this moisturizer would be good for those who suffer for extremely dry skin.</li>
      <li>I used to be an avid buyer of the original.</li>
      <li>So much for brand loyalty - I&#x27;ve been applying the original lotion to my face twice a day for 25 years.</li>
      <li>a right choice of me.</li>
      <li>I now have to begin a huge search for a new moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I loved the original lotion (I never liked the gel version).  </li>
      <li>I even tried the new DD Cream, hoping and praying that it was based on the original formula.</li>
      <li>Many of my friends feel the same way.</li>
      <li>I love this product and use all their facial products!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the reason I started using clinique as a teenager, and has been the reason I have purchased most of my facial products from clinique ever since.</li>
      <li>The label reads: K care Moisturize SMOOTH over Oil-Free Moisturizer For Sensitive Skin.  </li>
      <li>I am allergy to it when I use it for the first time.</li>
      <li>I used this lotion for 30 years, having super sensitive skin, with never a problem.  </li>
      <li>The new formula has more petrolatum (the only ingredient vaseline is made out of) in it than ever before.</li>
      <li>One package was broken, lucky thing is the bottle is good.</li>
      <li>I immediately went back to Clinique and have been a loyal user ever since!</li>
      <li>It works really well on my skin.</li>
      <li>so it absorbs very well.</li>
      <li>and although it is fragranced I think it&#x27;s very similar.&lt;br</li>
      <li>After going through many brands and types of moisturizers in order to find something like the old formula, I stumbled upon something at my local grocery store (Kroger).  </li>
      <li>This new formula has a funny odor, stings my skin, leaves my skin sticky (ditto on the bug spray feeling)  </li>
      <li>She&#x27;s allergic to many other brands but not Clinique.</li>
      <li>Please bring back the original....</li>
      <li>All I can say is bring back the original formula....</li>
      <li>I have dry skin and break out6 easily if the cream or lotion irritates my skin.</li>
      <li>The new formula gives me breakouts which I haven&#x27;t had since I was a teenager!</li>
      <li>I like it and highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for years and highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Boycotting Clinique completely til they bring my original back.</li>
      <li>I only use water and a washcloth on my face to clean it, and never wear face make-up because I&#x27;m so sensitive.  </li>
      <li>After trying about 20 other products, I seem to be having good luck with CeraVe moisturizing cream and Oil of Olay active hydrating cream.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love all Clinique products.</li>
    <li> Love it i always use this lotion.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to find this on here! We live a ways away from the nearest store that carries Clinique and I was out. I love this product and use all their facial products!</li>
    <li> Great product for a great price!</li>
    <li> At first I thought it was so oil and was not suitable for the summer. But when it turned cold, this cream  turned out to be comfortable and moisture and it has no fragrance. I like it and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Been using this for over 10 years. It&#x27;s the best lotion for your face out there!!</li>
    <li> Out standing product as are all the clinque products.  Have used it for years and continue to this day.</li>
    <li> you only need a little bit to go along way .. this is my 3rd bottle in a year.. this is the 1st produce I v bought repeated ..and I DO get complements on my face .. people ask what im using</li>
    <li> Perfect Exactly - As I ordered</li>
    <li> I am allergic to most products but have been using this for years with no problems,</li>
    <li> I am glad my mother did not have to see this..good thing she was with the sweet lord before they pulled this travesty.</li>
    <li> Great product fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Used the original DDML for over 20 years very happily. This version feels nothing like it, and not in a good way. It is weirdly sticky and never sinks into my face. Very disappointed. I have dry skin, by the way, which is the target demo for this lotion. I so wish Clinique would continue to offer the original to those who want to continue using it. There&#x27;s no reason there can&#x27;t be an original formula and a plus formula. Now searching for a new moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I have used this lotion for five years.  It is great under makeup.  It goes on very smooth and makes your face feel great.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin and break out6 easily if the cream or lotion irritates my skin. This is very moisturizing and good for sensitive skin. Good price too.</li>
    <li> Got this to give as a gift. Recipient was happy.</li>
    <li> For very good, Conforming our specific skin.</li>
    <li> I never tried the original formula, so I can&#x27;t comment on whether it was better. I can honestly say, that this product has had amazing effects on my skin. I&#x27;m in peri-menopause and my skin went from super oily all of my life...to mostly dry. My T-zone still gets a bit shiny, but my cheeks, nose and chin flake if not properly moisturized. The problem I had...is that I also have sensitive skin. Everything breaks me out and drug store products irritate after awhile. The only other brand I can half way tolerate is Neutrogena ageless essentials and it&#x27;s a bit too heavy and eventually causes me acne. This product has been a happy medium for me.  Melts into my skin and moisturizes the dry parts...while not leaving my T-zone an oil slick.  The texture of my skin used to be like sand paper, now it&#x27;s soft and supple once again. Best part...no break outs or flakies. It also evened out the dark patch under my eyes. I heard good things about this product, but figured it wouldn&#x27;t work for me and it was also rather pricey. I bought a 2oz sample from ebay and liked it so much, I purchased a full size. Great ingredients...excellent product. Give it a try if nothing else has worked for you....you might be surprised...I was.</li>
    <li> It seems to be a bit stale.</li>
    <li> I was appalled to learn of the change from the original DDM to a new product. It&#x27;s the reason I started using clinique as a teenager, and has been the reason I have purchased most of my facial products from clinique ever since. Many of my friends feel the same way. This is THE product that keeps bringing people back and sets the company apart form all the others to choose from. Not any more. I tried the + version, and had a horrible experience with it. My face didn&#x27;t absorb the moisture, and felt greasy and itchy all day. I kept trying it and it got worse. I then stocked up on all I could of the originals from outlet stores. My supply just ran out, and I have been at my wit&#x27;s end to find a replacement. I even tried the new DD Cream, hoping and praying that it was based on the original formula. Nope. Within an hour after application, my face felt greasy and itchy again. For the life of me, I can&#x27;t imagine why on earth clinique would disappoint its devoted fans by changing such a mainstay product. Even on the clinique website, the DDL only gets a 75% approval rating, means a quarter of the users are unhappy. It&#x27;s the same on Amazon and other on-line sources. I now have to begin a huge search for a new moisturizer. Once I find one, that&#x27;s where I&#x27;ll be taking my future business for all of my cosmetic needs, as I don&#x27;t have the time to run from one counter to another. This is just terribly disappointing, and I really wish the company would listen to its longstanding supporters and provide the original as an option.</li>
    <li> I used this lotion for 30 years, having super sensitive skin, with never a problem.  I only use water and a washcloth on my face to clean it, and never wear face make-up because I&#x27;m so sensitive.  Now, I&#x27;ve lost the only moisturizer I could use.  Oh, I&#x27;ve tried others: Clarins, Lauder, La Mer, even Kiss My Face.  All caused breakouts.  This new DDML formula has me breaking out like a teenager.  I have called them, live-chatted with them, begged them, and they insist that this product is better and are not budging.&lt;br /&gt;So, it is I who must go....</li>
    <li> I purchased this at my Clinique counter, didn&#x27;t pay attention to the \\&quot;+\\&quot; improved formula.  This new stuff is bad news.  My skin looked greasy because it never absorbed.  I have very dry skin after taking Accutane, and I haven&#x27;t had a breakout in 2 years...until I used this junk.  I at least 10 pimples.  I stopped using it, and I haven&#x27;t gotten any pimples since.  This product needs to be changed back, or at least give an option to buy the original formula (I just bought up a bunch of the old formula online).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the original for 30+ years and this new formula is terrible.  Makes your face feel oily all day.  Switched to another company.  Clinique lost ALL my business.</li>
    <li> I have used it for several years. Great moisturizing cream. My skin is normal/combination.  I have not noticed any changes after they launched the &amp;#34;new formula&amp;#34;. It works the same for me.</li>
    <li> I liked the older version more, but decided to try the newer version.</li>
    <li> My favourite moisturiser</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used (the old) Clinique Dramatically Different Morsturizing Lotion since 1989 ..  25 years.  but Clinique ruined this product last year when they changed the formula..  it&#x27;s now oily and doesn&#x27;t absorb, and is obviously made with cheaper greasy ingredients.  after a quarter century I&#x27;m now moving on.  sorry you chased me away Clinique, this customer spent a fortune on this lotion all these years but now I&#x27;m done with it.</li>
    <li> LOVE this moisturiser. And have for years</li>
    <li> Hate the new formula, has anyone found a good replacement?  I need a moisturizer that is unscented and without sunscreen.  The new formula gives me breakouts which I haven&#x27;t had since I was a teenager!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for many years. It is fantastic, not oily at all</li>
    <li> This is the New Coke of moisturizers. Avoid at all costs. Leaves a tacky sticky film on my skin for the entire day (or night). So much for brand loyalty - I&#x27;ve been applying the original lotion to my face twice a day for 25 years. Clinique will not get a penny from me for another bottle of moisturizer and that&#x27;s a lot of dollars out of their pocket. The new formula started out, on the Clinique website in August, around 88% approval. Now it&#x27;s at 65%. They have GOT to be losing money - maybe they&#x27;ll listen to their wallets, since they&#x27;re clearly not listening to their long-term customers. Fight the power!</li>
    <li> Great price and with my super sensitive skin, I&#x27;m willing to buy whatever works. I use it daily. Small enough to bring with me when I travel.</li>
    <li> I love the original DDML and was shocked last night when Macys told me that it has been discontinued.  The girl behind the counter told me it will feel the same and I bought it. Needless to say, it went from a five star product to one that shouldn&#x27;t even be on the shelves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you first put it on, you will notice that it no longer feels lightweight or smooth. The reason I loved this product is because of how easily it could be layered with creams or makeup. It literally felt like bug spray on my face. If you know what 90% humidity feels like mixed with sweat and stickiness, that is how this so-called improved version felt like. My skin never absorbed it and it felt like it was weighing down on my skin. I washed it off quickly and I would not recommend this to anyone or purchase this ever again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clinique made a terrible business move and judging from other reviews, many are outraged as well. This new concoction contains barley extract, cucumber, sunflower seedcake, and plenty of extra acids to give you hives and acne. If you have sensitive skin like me, run from this terror.</li>
    <li> I am allergy to it when I use it for the first time. I want to return it. What a pity</li>
    <li> Do not buy the new formula - it is thick, sticky, tacky. Do not buy any Clinique products until the company agrees to bring back the old formula. And ignore the positive reviews on Clinique.com that have popped up in the last few days- they&#x27;re fake to distract from the overwhelmingly horrible reviews the new product is receiving. The company has betrayed the good will of the many, many customers who have used and praised DDML over the years- it shows how little they think of us.</li>
    <li> Worst moisturizer I have ever used! I do believe this moisturizer would be good for those who suffer for extremely dry skin. It however was greasy on my face, didn&#x27;t absorb well and left a film-like sticky shiny residue. Not to mention I broke out like CRAZY! I get a few sporadic blemishes here and there once a month so I know when I use a product and I breakout it is in fact due to the product. I didn&#x27;t do anything new to my routine except add this moisturizer into the rotation. And to top it off I NEVER breakout on my chin, it&#x27;s usually on the sides of my cheeks. Need more proof that this is what caused me to breakout? Well I was told your neck needs moisturizers as well, so I cleanse my neck now &amp; used the moisturizer on my neck, tonnnnns of pimples all underneath my chin and going down the sides of my neck.&lt;br /&gt;Be cautious with this. By the smaller size. And if you start breaking out STOP using it!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I purchased from Sephora*</li>
    <li> Gift that makes Mom Happy :) need  say more ???</li>
    <li> I have used it for years...couldn&#x27;t be without it!</li>
    <li> The new formula is awful. I&#x27;m so outraged they changed it. I used to be an avid buyer of the original. The new formula has more petrolatum (the only ingredient vaseline is made out of) in it than ever before. It&#x27;s the 3rd or 4th ingredient I believe. Before it was made out of things like sesame oi. It feels filmy and greasy because it is basically vaseline with a few drops of &#x27;natural&#x27; stuff added to try and fool us customers into thinking it&#x27;s better...when the ingredient amounts make it way cheaper quality than before! Boycotting Clinique completely til they bring my original back. If I can recommend a product that&#x27;s similar I&#x27;d say try Olay Active Hydrating Beauty Fluid. You can get it at Target, Wal-Mart etc... It&#x27;s 7 or 8 bucks and although it is fragranced I think it&#x27;s very similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;by the way, I bought it at sephora</li>
    <li> I ordered this on line to save myself a trip to the mall.  The price was a little savings, but the best is NO MALL stop.</li>
    <li> Compare the bottle to the ones on department store shelves, it is not the same. It&#x27;s now being returned to the vender.</li>
    <li> This is a very interesting lotion.  It is not greasy and it makes my foundation look smoother and natural. excellent</li>
    <li> I used to be a big fan of clinique but I feel like they are not the same as a few years back, their quality is not the same. Even the consistency of this cream doesnt seem to be the same. I will not be purchasing it again because of this as well as the fact that this product is not that great for you skin (too many chemicals, not natural) and in my opinion, this out ways the benefits of using it.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t relate to the negative reviews.  I LOVE this lotion.  It&#x27;s perfect.  I&#x27;m 46 y/o with combination skin and, to me, it&#x27;s the holy grail.  Goes on nicely, makes my skin feel moisturized all day, not AT ALL oily.  After a month of use, I see dramatic improvement of my skin&#x27;s overall look.  Smooth texture and glow.  I&#x27;m wearing less makeup because I don&#x27;t even need it!  I don&#x27;t have anything bad to say.  I think it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
    <li> Somewhere I read that this is formulated just like your own skin oils so it absorbs very well. It definitely feels like a relief. I use it in combination with all of my dermatologist crafted potions since it doesn&#x27;t have any extra &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; in it to irritate or counteract the active ingredients in my prescribed products.</li>
    <li> Their is no substitute for dramatically different moisturizing lotion. I have been searching forever to find a cheaper face lotion with comparable quality.  I still have never found anything that competes with this product but I will keep looking.</li>
    <li> Please bring back the original....I was a loyal user for over 10 years and my mother also.  We both cannot use the Plus....I find it sticky and unpleasant.  My mother bought 12 bottles of the original DDML - not sure where she hid it but she isn&#x27;t telling.  I will NOT buy the Plus no matter what.....am actively looking for a new moisturizer.  I am in my 40&#x27;s.  HELP I need a good moisturizer.....</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizing cream!  It makes your skin feel great and it lasts a long time. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I also hate the new DDML+ and have been searching for a replacement.  After trying about 20 other products, I seem to be having good luck with CeraVe moisturizing cream and Oil of Olay active hydrating cream.  The Olay is scented, but doesn&#x27;t seem to bother me as other products do with fragrance.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this. She&#x27;s allergic to many other brands but not Clinique. She&#x27;s gorgeous. I&#x27;m sold!</li>
    <li> as promised and as expected</li>
    <li> My order was for normal skin , an i got one for extra dry skin, now my wife can&#x27;t used it ,it was a gif for her , so my gif is useless</li>
    <li> They changed the formula a couple of years ago and added a plus sign (+) sign to the name.  I loved the original lotion (I never liked the gel version).  Clinique&#x27;s current formula makes my face feel dirty and it causes my skin to itch.  For the last 2 years, I have looked for something to replace it.  After going through many brands and types of moisturizers in order to find something like the old formula, I stumbled upon something at my local grocery store (Kroger).  I LOVE IT!!  It&#x27;s the Kroger generic brand,  believe it or not.  The label reads: K care Moisturize SMOOTH over Oil-Free Moisturizer For Sensitive Skin.  A 4 oz bottle costs about $7.</li>
    <li> good product and fast delivary</li>
    <li> Very happy with my purchase. Arrived quickly and great moisturizer for my dry skin.</li>
    <li> Like many others, I used the original formula for many, many years and considered it an essential.  Sometimes I supplement it with a heavier cream at night, or one with sunscreen during the day but it is always what I put on my face after I wash it.  The new lotion + is sticky and has an odd smell.  Why, oh why, did you change it?!?</li>
    <li> great product as always.</li>
    <li> I cannot relate to all the negative reviews. I&#x27;m 20 years old and live in Pullman, WA. I already have dry skin, probably near the extreme side. Pullman has a very dry climate which increases my dryness. I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for 6 years and no complaints. It works really well on my skin. I use it every morning don&#x27;t always remember to use it at night. I would recommend this product to anyone who needs just a basic daily moisturizer. This product isn&#x27;t meant to reduce your pores, wrinkles or any other blemishes. It&#x27;s job is to moisturize and that it does well.</li>
    <li> The original DDML formula was the best and I have used it for over 20 years. This new formula has a funny odor, stings my skin, leaves my skin sticky (ditto on the bug spray feeling)  makeup does not apply well over it and after a few days of use my skin starts to break out. All I can say is bring back the original formula....until then I will be trying out different moisturizers.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> i did the same thing above. There were moments when placing the orders that i repeatedc myself. Nothing to add</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years, but in all honesty I think Oil Of Olay does just as well. Still I do like this product.</li>
    <li> How on earth would they change the perfect product ???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I react badly to the new formula - too greasy and my face gets &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34; from an allergy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A terrible move</li>
    <li> One package was broken, lucky thing is the bottle is good.</li>
    <li> wife loves it! enough said!</li>
    <li> a right choice of me.</li>
    <li> I have liked this product since the first time I used it (about 2 years ago)!</li>
    <li> Wonderful light moisturizer.  I&#x27;ve used it for years as part of the Clinique 3-step skin care program.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll continue to use this seller because the size of this bottle costs $10 to $15 more in department stores, plus the shipping was free.  I&#x27;ve used Clinique products for 40 years; I tried another brand sold at a department store once and my skin broke out.  I immediately went back to Clinique and have been a loyal user ever since!</li>
