      <li>it was amazing the junk that came out!,,</li>
      <li>Great service, great product, love them!</li>
      <li>Along with a full dental regimen that includes pre-brush anti placque rinse, a Sonicare tooth brush, post brush flouride rinse, and flossing, these brushes provide excellent care.</li>

      <li>Great item and cheap.</li>
      <li>The best deep clean teeth brush!!!</li>
      <li>These are easy to use no matter where you are, even in bed!</li>
      <li>Easy to hold and use, cheap and practical to carry around!!</li>
      <li>but you cannot use them more than 3-4 times for each brush...</li>
      <li>It does not get better than Dentek Slim brushes:</li>
      <li>the price was much better than I could find at a store</li>
      <li>These things are fantastic!</li>
      <li>SO THEY WERE WHAT I THOUGHT THEY WERE LIKE AND WOULD ORDER AGAIN LOVE THEM</li>
      <li>We love it, but don&#x27;t like the fact that it is so flimsy; it gets bent out of shape easily, when we think we would like to use it more than once.  </li>
      <li>Received in very quickly.  </li>
      <li>Thus I often have to use more than one to properly clean between all my teeth.</li>
      <li>The older ones fit much better, the bristles are longer and I feel that I have a good clean.  </li>
      <li>highly recommended very good product, product description fully matches the final product and I&#x27;m happy with the purchase is highly recommended</li>
      <li>They too don&#x27;t fit between the teeth.</li>
      <li>and they DO fit.</li>
      <li>Easy to use &amp; really helps prevent the the plaque buildup.</li>
      <li>I have used only three of the brushes but I will probably discard the remaining brushes as they are not usable or effective.</li>
      <li>They slip right between the teeth and clear out most food particles.</li>
      <li>Great product for those of us with little space between teeth!</li>
      <li>If the picture was of the yellow ones, I would be a better informed buyer.</li>
      <li>Nice for tight spaces.  </li>
      <li>The bristles somehow are much shorter.  </li>
      <li>These are what my dentist recommended and they seem to work very well for me..</li>
      <li>Thanks a million for this slim size.</li>
      <li>very flimsy brush.</li>
      <li>Just be careful of tip not to push between teeth if it doesnt go easy.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended for anyone who use this type of ite,.</li>
      <li>Everything is the same on the package but the yellow ones don&#x27;t fit between my teeth.</li>
      <li>The handle is long enough to reach easily.</li>
      <li>but these gentle slim brushes clean out where my flossing may not clean well at times.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m having trouble using them as they bend easily.</li>
      <li>I have very tight spaces between my teeth and food gets stuck easily and can&#x27;t get out with floss.</li>
      <li>I am now afraid to buy more, not knowing if they will fit.  </li>
      <li>My only complaint is that they bend and become unusable pretty easily.</li>
      <li>These little soft slim brushes clean between my teeth in the spaces I started getting now at age 53.  </li>
      <li>But the new ones I bought recently do work at all.  </li>
      <li>As one might expect if you try to jam them in tight places to quickly they will bend but no big deal as can straighten it out with no trouble.</li>

<li> I bought both the yellow and green ones.</li>

<li> So I got on amazon and saw these GREEN ones and ordered 3 packs when I got em they were all yellow.</li>

<li> These Cleaners reach just where they are needed for my tight teeth and</li>
<li> it&#x27;s a sturdy little brush</li>
<li> I have really tight contacts between my molars and the green ones did not bend and collapse like these.</li>
<li> and they were out of the green</li>
<li> Found green ones at the store, got em</li>
<li> so it is difficult to get to back teeth.  </li>
<li> I noticed that they were made in India and not sure if the products were made to be shorter or not made to the standards.  </li>
<li> Of course, it was a very small package.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These are what my dentist recommended and they seem to work very well for me..it&#x27;s a sturdy little brush but you cannot use them more than 3-4 times for each brush...and I prefer to change them often anyway.</li>
    <li> The best deep clean teeth brush!!!</li>
    <li> I have found the DenTek Slim Brush Cleaners to be the best I have used yet. They beat the GUMs by a mile. My teeth are tight together and these little DenTeks get right in. I can&#x27;t get GUMs to do that on all my teeth. The DenTeks can be used repeatedly and longer than the GUM brand. They slip right between the teeth and clear out most food particles. They are really superior!!! Highly recommended for anyone who use this type of ite,.</li>
    <li> Great service, great product, love them!</li>
    <li> We love it, but don&#x27;t like the fact that it is so flimsy; it gets bent out of shape easily, when we think we would like to use it more than once.  But it does an excellent job.</li>
    <li> My dentist gave me a sample of this product to use.  These little soft slim brushes clean between my teeth in the spaces I started getting now at age 53.  I do floss but these gentle slim brushes clean out where my flossing may not clean well at times.  Just be careful of tip not to push between teeth if it doesnt go easy.  Thanks a million for this slim size.</li>
    <li> I have very tight spaces between my teeth and food gets stuck easily and can&#x27;t get out with floss. This works terrific and gets all the food out. Love them!</li>
    <li> These are the best alternative to toothpicks !</li>
    <li> They do for me what they were designed to do.  As one might expect if you try to jam them in tight places to quickly they will bend but no big deal as can straighten it out with no trouble.</li>
    <li> very flimsy brush. handle is too short so it is difficult to get to back teeth.  would never buy again. I have used only three of the brushes but I will probably discard the remaining brushes as they are not usable or effective.</li>
    <li> I have really tight contacts between my molars and the green ones did not bend and collapse like these. I find it takes two of the yellow ones to do the work of one green one.  If the picture was of the yellow ones, I would be a better informed buyer.</li>
    <li> Product works as described</li>
    <li> Easy to use &amp; really helps prevent the the plaque buildup. I would recommend these for anyone who has issues with plaque.</li>
    <li> highly recommended very good product, product description fully matches the final product and I&#x27;m happy with the purchase is highly recommended</li>
    <li> great product was exactually what I wanted and needed,  I am so glad I bought it.and the price was much better than I could find at a store</li>
    <li> I HAVE USED THESE BEFORE SO THEY WERE WHAT I THOUGHT THEY WERE LIKE AND WOULD ORDER AGAIN LOVE THEM</li>
    <li> Since I&#x27;ve started using these I&#x27;ve reverse my gum recession issue. I get rave reviews from my dentist. Along with a full dental regimen that includes pre-brush anti placque rinse, a Sonicare tooth brush, post brush flouride rinse, and flossing, these brushes provide excellent care. I use after every meal.</li>
    <li> It does not get better than Dentek Slim brushes: Easy to hold and use, cheap and practical to carry around!!</li>
    <li> I know it shouldn&#x27;t matter but it does. I&#x27;ve always used the green ones then ran out so went to the local store and they were out of the green so I bought the yellow. Everything is the same on the package but the yellow ones don&#x27;t fit between my teeth. So I got on amazon and saw these GREEN ones and ordered 3 packs when I got em they were all yellow. And guess what. They too don&#x27;t fit between the teeth. Found green ones at the store, got em and they DO fit.</li>
    <li> I have braces and these slim brush cleaners are a lot easier to floss with than just regular dental floss. My only complaint is that they bend and become unusable pretty easily. Thus I often have to use more than one to properly clean between all my teeth. But this might just be because of the braces.</li>
    <li> Received in very quickly.  Of course, it was a very small package.  Everything is ducky.</li>
    <li> If you have minimal space between teeth, this is your product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m having trouble using them as they bend easily.</li>
    <li> very good item, slim and clean</li>
    <li> Have braces and these are truly the best. They don&#x27;t irritate my gums, but yet get the food out.</li>
    <li> Great item and cheap.</li>
    <li> Nice for tight spaces.  The handle is long enough to reach easily.</li>
    <li> I have finally found a way to get into the habit of flossing every night.  These are easy to use no matter where you are, even in bed!</li>
    <li> These work well to get food caught in my teeth.</li>
    <li> These things are fantastic! I brushed my teeth with my sonicare toothbrush, then flossed, then sonicare again and then used one of these....it was amazing the junk that came out!,,</li>
    <li> These Cleaners reach just where they are needed for my tight teeth and the price is good.&lt;br /&gt;When you require a given number of words you might start to ask why people put this off so long</li>
    <li> I bought both the yellow and green ones. The older ones fit much better, the bristles are longer and I feel that I have a good clean.  But the new ones I bought recently do work at all.  The bristles somehow are much shorter.  I noticed that they were made in India and not sure if the products were made to be shorter or not made to the standards.  I am now afraid to buy more, not knowing if they will fit.  You can&#x27;t tell the difference by looking at them but your teeth will tell you.</li>
    <li> Great product for those of us with little space between teeth!</li>
    <li> I wish I knew about these 20 years ago !&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re convenient for auto or home</li>
