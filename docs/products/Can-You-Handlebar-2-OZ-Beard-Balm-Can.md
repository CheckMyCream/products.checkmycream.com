      <li>Well, this stuff is fantastic!</li>
      <li>There are so many uses for these beard oils, ladies, not just for your man&#x27;s beard!&lt;br</li>
      <li>What more can I ask for?</li>
      <li>Saw this on one of my hubby&#x27;s favorite websites for manly gifts.</li>
      <li>I think it just works better.</li>
      <li>It was much more groomed and manageable.</li>
      <li>Better price.</li>
      <li>was given this for free in exchange for my honest review.</li>
      <li>Since my daugters father and my step father has recieved many items for their beards frok.em to review I tested this out myself after my tested it on my owm hair just to play.</li>
      <li>Make sure you use it sparingly, as the instructions say.</li>
      <li>He will defiantly be buying more of this product.</li>
      <li>keeps my beard in place and healthy.</li>
      <li>What an interesting line of products this company has.  </li>
      <li>I really enjoyed getting this beard oil and will be gifting it out.  </li>
      <li>I received a free or discounted product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
      <li>I received the product for free or a discounted amount for an unbiased and honest opinion...</li>
      <li>(Classic is MY favorite!!)</li>
      <li>I find that refreshing in a company - it makes me feel more comfortable with the quality of the product not having to depend on machines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>which I took to mean that it is the perfect size, feels good on the face and delivers the product evenly.</li>
      <li>like that it has great natural ingredients.</li>
      <li>Plus it is a lot easy to style it</li>
      <li>product arrived very quickly and undamaged.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and creates just a bit of hold, in addition to adding a light sheen.  </li>
      <li>a conditioner/softener it seems to work fine,</li>
      <li>Got this for free or discounted........</li>
      <li>The only way to win this prize from me was to stand on 1 foot and give your beard a full &amp;#34;updo&amp;#34;  then afterwards he had to wash out his beard and give me his opinion on the product.</li>
      <li>It left his skin feeling soothed and his beard looked amazing!</li>
      <li>was so excited to get this in the mail and see how it worked on my husband&#x27;s beard.</li>
      <li>The Dry Beard Oil is a great product.  </li>
      <li>Just enough strength to make my beard tidy, while also giving it nourishing and refreshing oils.</li>
      <li>He said the first application, he used too much and it was kind of gooky and super shiny.</li>
      <li>I can mildly smell</li>
      <li>It is very easy to spread evenly through my beard and helps keep stray or wild hair under control.  </li>
      <li>The product itself does seem to soften my beard a bit, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to help much with styling or stray hairs (which I&#x27;m willing to admit may be a factor of my own beard hair as much as the product itself).</li>
      <li>and I may very well try the scented version at some point, but the fragrance free option is unusable to me.</li>
      <li>Hopefully the personal thoughts I shared here will help you prepare for your own experience with this product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The folks at CanYouHandlebar were nice enough to provide me with this complimentary product so that I could evaluate it.  </li>
      <li>husbands beard looks so shiny, healthy and soft.</li>
      <li>I was given the opportunity to receive a complimentary tin of Moustache Wax that I gave to my husband in exchange we would test this product &amp; post our results here in this review.</li>
      <li>In all, I highly recommend this as a nice gift for a crabby old man.</li>
      <li>When is he going to learn I&#x27;m usually right?</li>
      <li>The dry oil is really nice since it doesn&#x27;t leave that greasy feeling after use.  </li>
      <li>I personally don&#x27;t have a beard lol, but when I was offered the opportunity to get this product at a deep discount for the purpose of testing and review, the first person that came to mind is my dad who is retired and decided to grow a beard.</li>
      <li>Not only did it prove that I was right, now my husband looks better.</li>
      <li>No strong smell at  all so really pleasant to me</li>
      <li>Excellent.gives beard a little hold and keeps it looking good through the day.</li>
      <li>will be buying more in future.</li>
      <li>Vegans should be aware, there are animal products in this.&lt;br</li>

      <li>His beard now looks so very groomed and not like duck dynasty anymore!  </li>
      <li>I was so excited to be able to get this product during a promotion so that I could share my experience with CanYouHandlebar Classic Scent Beard Dry Oil here with you.</li>
      <li>The dry oil with brush as well as the beard soap (unfathomable amount of lather) are a daily necessity for keeping a large beard looking great.</li>
      <li>He will use the Wisdom, since he is enjoying the product, but it is his least favorite.</li>
      <li>For best results, use the least amount possible to get the shine and hold you are looking for.  </li>
      <li>Less is more sometimes!  </li>
      <li>So I don&#x27;t have a beard, but I love all things &#x27;oils&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this dry beard oil on my fingernails, and really, they haven&#x27;t looked</li>
      <li>The container is very manageable and easy to open and close.</li>
      <li>and it adds such a smooth finish and made it feel so much softer.</li>
      <li>I sent him the whole set</li>
      <li>It looked and felt so much softer.</li>
      <li>If you’re looking for a light, natural beard oil, you’ll thoroughly enjoy the CanYouHandleBar Classic Beard Dry Oil.  </li>
      <li>My husband has a very manly beard and at times it can get unruly and very itchy for him.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much to do the job either.</li>
      <li>Very shiny.&lt;br /&gt;Much</li>
      <li>more waxy than I expected, but works well with a horse hair or badger hair brush.</li>
      <li>The real thing I don&#x27;t care for however is the smell.</li>
      <li>I  Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>I got this product for my Uncle to use on his goatee and he absolutely loves it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Saw this on one of my hubby&#x27;s favorite websites for manly gifts. It&#x27;s pricey tho. Same product. Better price.</li>
    <li> My wife treated me to the Build a Beard Care Kit and the beard soap.  I tried the dry oil first for a few days and was amazed how soft my beard was becoming without being &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34;.  I really was just looking for a conditioner and tamer rather than a &amp;#34;styling&amp;#34; product and I have finally found one!  I&#x27;m really enjoying the products, thank you!  As a side not I have a red beard so my hair tends to be super coarse and unmanageable, but these products are doing the trick.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Just enough strength to make my beard tidy, while also giving it nourishing and refreshing oils.</li>
    <li> I got this product for my Uncle to use on his goatee and he absolutely loves it. He had never used a beard oil before and this really made his facial hair soft and shiny. It also conditioned his skin which tends to be dry underneath the hair. It doesn&#x27;t take much to do the job either. The dry oil is really nice since it doesn&#x27;t leave that greasy feeling after use.  The smell of the classic beard dry oil is so subtle and nice for those who can&#x27;t tolerate much scent.  The tin that it comes in is nice because it&#x27;s a great size for traveling as well as at home. I received this product at a reduced price in lieu of my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> As my husband becomes an old curmudgeon it becomes more and more difficult to buy him Christmas gifts. SO, this year I turned to Can You Handlebar. I bought a start up kit -- brush and three tins of dry beard oil. He LOVES the brush!! and loves the Initiative and Classic scents. (Classic is MY favorite!!) He will use the Wisdom, since he is enjoying the product, but it is his least favorite. When I asked why he liked the brush, he replied, &amp;#34;It&#x27;s freakin&#x27; perfect!&amp;#34; which I took to mean that it is the perfect size, feels good on the face and delivers the product evenly. In all, I highly recommend this as a nice gift for a crabby old man. It will make him smile ( at least for a little while.)</li>
    <li> Excellent.gives beard a little hold and keeps it looking good through the day.</li>
    <li> Use sparingly. Very shiny.&lt;br /&gt;Much more waxy than I expected, but works well with a horse hair or badger hair brush.</li>
    <li> What an interesting line of products this company has.  I really enjoyed getting this beard oil and will be gifting it out.  The company created this all-natural product by including local wax (from Michigan bees), USP lanolin, castor oil, coconut oil, Shea butter and vitamin E. The batches are made, inspected and packaged in the USA. I find that refreshing in a company - it makes me feel more comfortable with the quality of the product not having to depend on machines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product will restore the natural oils in your facial hair, while also conditioning and softening it.  It&#x27;s easy to apply and creates just a bit of hold, in addition to adding a light sheen.  For best results, use the least amount possible to get the shine and hold you are looking for.  Less is more sometimes!  I think it will last quite awhile (depending on beard size of course) and is something for the guy that already has everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The folks at CanYouHandlebar were nice enough to provide me with this complimentary product so that I could evaluate it.  Therefore, I agreed to provide honest feedback when posting my review.  Hopefully the personal thoughts I shared here will help you prepare for your own experience with this product.</li>
    <li> My husband has a very manly beard and at times it can get unruly and very itchy for him. He works outside in subzero temps everyday so his skin gets really dry. I was so excited to be able to get this product during a promotion so that I could share my experience with CanYouHandlebar Classic Scent Beard Dry Oil here with you. I didn’t know that such a product existed to help him manage his beard and condition his skin at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;The product arrived very quickly and undamaged. The container is very manageable and easy to open and close. There is no scent to this product which my husband liked because some products make him “smell like a flower”. You don’t need very much of this product, a little goes a long way. It left his skin feeling soothed and his beard looked amazing! His beard was very shiny and looked like he had just been groomed at the barber! Great product, worth the price!</li>
    <li> Disclaimer: I received a free or discounted product in exchange for my honest review. All opinions are my own.&lt;br /&gt;I was so excited to get this in the mail and see how it worked on my husband&#x27;s beard. He has had a beard for about 15 years and sometimes it gets really rough and dry.&lt;br /&gt;This looks so small when it first arrived I thought it would not last long. Well I was so wrong, it only takes a very small amount to warm up in your hand goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;My husbands beard looks so shiny, healthy and soft. Plus it is a lot easy to style it and it stays in place. I also love that it is all natural and not full of any yucky chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;My husband also shaves his head and he used a very small amount of the wax to put a nice shine on his dome.&lt;br /&gt;This is a really nice product.</li>
    <li> The product arrived and the outside of the tin was greasy, not sure if this was an issue with shipping or manufacture. I was expecting something with a hardness similar to chap stick, instead it&#x27;s closer to petroleum jelly. Not a problem, just an FYI. The product itself does seem to soften my beard a bit, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to help much with styling or stray hairs (which I&#x27;m willing to admit may be a factor of my own beard hair as much as the product itself). The real thing I don&#x27;t care for however is the smell. I purchased the no scent version as I wanted something neutral, however, instead it just smells greasy, slightly metallic and a little stale/musty. Basically to me the product just smells unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a conditioner/softener it seems to work fine, and I may very well try the scented version at some point, but the fragrance free option is unusable to me.</li>
    <li> Another great product from a great company. Highly recommended &amp;#34;received this item for testing and review purposes!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> The u scented actually smells bad. It has a medicine type smell. Did not contact customer service about exchanging, but will update if they do</li>
    <li> ** received for review and inspection purposes **&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a beard guy, but my gramps is. I sent him the whole set and he likes it (he&#x27;s very hard to please). Use sparingly though. He said the first application, he used too much and it was kind of gooky and super shiny.</li>
    <li> Thankfully this stuff came wrapped in its own plastic bag; it had leaked out all over the inside of the bag it came in. It was an oily and greasy mess to clean up. I can&#x27;t fault the company--probably melted during transit, but I was still annoyed. I don&#x27;t like the odor one bit. It is &amp;quot;unscented&amp;quot; but its natural odor (color and texture) is akin to petroleum jelly. Make sure you use it sparingly, as the instructions say.</li>
    <li> I was given the opportunity to receive a complimentary tin of Moustache Wax that I gave to my husband in exchange we would test this product &amp; post our results here in this review. My husband had never used a wax before so this was a learning process for both of us. As suggested by a friend we kept the tin closed tightly and let in sit in some warm water until it softened up. My husband was then able to work with the wax and make little handle bars out of his moustache. Seeing as he keeps it pretty trim, they were really small handle bars. But this stuff worked great!</li>
    <li> I got this oil for my husband to try out. He&#x27;s always complaining about his beard itching. It&#x27;s always dull looking and he doesn&#x27;t take care of it at all. He says men don&#x27;t put things on their beard hair. Boy, did I prove him wrong! I gave him this and told him to use it! As soon as he used it he said &amp;#34;I like this stuff.&amp;#34; Yea, of course you did. When is he going to learn I&#x27;m usually right? *lol* Especially since I am a salon professional with a license in hair! I noticed a difference in his beard instantly. It had instant shine. It looked and felt so much softer. It looked less damaged. It was much more groomed and manageable. There were no longer any random stray hairs sticking out! I&#x27;m very impressed with this stuff. Not only did it prove that I was right, now my husband looks better. What more can I ask for? I highly recommend this dry oil! *Sample provided for testing and review*</li>
    <li> Got this for free or discounted........&lt;br /&gt;Husband liked it said he liked the way made his mustache feel. will be buying more in future.</li>
    <li> I got this product for my husband at a great deal to offer my honest opinion. My husband as a not too thick beard,  This beard dry oil can tame the rebels on his beard with easy  without being greasy or sticky. No strong smell at  all so really pleasant to me I  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! I&#x27;ve used several of their products now, and not one has disappointed.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product as a Father&#x27;s Day gift but my toddler son found my hiding spot and gave it to daddy. So far my husband has used it twice, it does condition the beard slightly and gives it a healthy look. I am unable to write a full review on any significant changes since it has only been a short period of time. I am willing to update this review and let you all know after 1-2 weeks if anyone is wanting to know the overall benefits and cons. So far he does like it1</li>
    <li> I received the product for free or a discounted amount for an unbiased and honest opinion... I got this for my boyfriend. He is growing a beard. This product smelled good. My boyfriend use to complain about his face itching after shaving. After he began to use this product the itching stopped. He  had very dry skin especially in the cold winter months. But this has help with the dryness and his facial hair looks silky. He will defiantly be buying more of this product.</li>
    <li> Since my daugters father and my step father has recieved many items for their beards frok.em to review I tested this out myself after my tested it on my owm hair just to play. This crazy back and forth bipolar weather in texas as caused my own hair to feel all dried out. So i applied a little after i dried and straightened my hair and it adds such a smooth finish and made it feel so much softer. I loved it for myself</li>
    <li> If you’re looking for a light, natural beard oil, you’ll thoroughly enjoy the CanYouHandleBar Classic Beard Dry Oil.  Its not your average &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34;. If your not one for scented oil than this product is for you. (very natural)  This oil will also give your beard a healthy sheen that makes it look as good as it makes you feel. You’ll also want to check out CanYouHandleBar mustache wax and beard oil as well. All of these products are exquisite and work well for a great price. I would order again and recommend to anyone in need of beard oil. I received this product in exchange for an honest/unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Almost scentless. I can mildly smell the lanolin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves a shine, but does  not feel greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I like that it has great natural ingredients.Vegans should be aware, there are animal products in this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Provides moisture to dry coarse hairs.&lt;br /&gt;great gift for the men in your life.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical about the dry oil, but the skin underneath was telling me something had to be done. Well, this stuff is fantastic! No more itching, cracking, or burning on the skin, and my beard is a smooth, shiny wonder now. A lot more unsolicited complements these days. I would estimate the brush to be a requirement -- would be very messy otherwise. The brush is well-made and provides a nice bit of massage to work the oil all over hear and skin underneath. It&#x27;s a morning ritual now, and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be ordering a refill when the time comes (probably many months -- a little goes a long way).</li>
    <li> Everything came on time the wax worked great! I used the soft wax for the base and the stiff wax for the ends. The beard oil took a bit too get used to but worked well and smells great. This will be my first and only stop for beard and moustache care and styling!</li>
    <li> Really like using the dry oil. keeps my beard in place and healthy.</li>
    <li> Can you handlebar makes the best products I&#x27;ve used in my beard. Nothing else comes close!</li>
    <li> As a man with a particularly thick beard, it can be a hassle trying to get out of the house without looking like Karl Marx. CanYouHandlebar BDO is the ONLY product I&#x27;ve encountered that can tame my face. It has just enough hold to keep it where I want without being greasy or sticky. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> The Dry Beard Oil is a great product.  I use it with the Beard Oil Brush.  It is very easy to spread evenly through my beard and helps keep stray or wild hair under control.  I like the Dry Beard Oil better than the standard liquid beard oil. I think it just works better.</li>
    <li> The dry oil with brush as well as the beard soap (unfathomable amount of lather) are a daily necessity for keeping a large beard looking great. The moustache comb is also much handier than expected. Awesome site, great videos, flawless customer service. It&#x27;s hard to go unnoticed with a big beard so keep it looking sharp</li>
    <li> So I don&#x27;t have a beard, but I love all things &#x27;oils&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this dry beard oil on my fingernails, and really, they haven&#x27;t looked better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I scrape some of the dry oil out with my nails, then I rub my nails together to heat it up and liquify the oils, and then I rub the oil into my nails and cuticles.  There are so many uses for these beard oils, ladies, not just for your man&#x27;s beard!&lt;br /&gt;So go ahead, and steal his product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given this for free in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> Please don&#x27;t believe those 5 stars reviews. They are fake. This thing stinks! My girl didn&#x27;t even want to kiss me. It didn&#x27;t do any of the things it supposed to do.  Please save yourself the hassle.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff! I personally don&#x27;t have a beard lol, but when I was offered the opportunity to get this product at a deep discount for the purpose of testing and review, the first person that came to mind is my dad who is retired and decided to grow a beard. Well, As we all know, beards are coarse and sometimes prickly. I gave him this beard oil and he loves it and so does my mom.  His beard now looks so very groomed and not like duck dynasty anymore!  He says also that he&#x27;s not as itchy which is a big plus since we live in a dry desert climate and winters can be brutal on skin and hair.  Remember, a beard is hair and needs all the tlc that we give to the hair on our heads! So ladies, if you&#x27;re tired of your man&#x27;s prickly beard and want to spoil your man, then this product is for you!</li>
    <li> use. Made is beard softer instantly Would recommend this product for anyone that wants to take care of their beard and mustache.</li>
    <li> This CanYouHandlebar Classic Scented Beard Dry Oil 2 OZ Can: No Added Scents or Colors, All Natural Beard Balm was actually given away as a prize from me at a motorcycle rally my brother runs for Harley Davidson. The only way to win this prize from me was to stand on 1 foot and give your beard a full &amp;#34;updo&amp;#34;  then afterwards he had to wash out his beard and give me his opinion on the product. He stood on my foot (350lb bike in all leathers) and put his beard in 5 pony tails braided each one the put a ponytail holder at the end. The he tucked the end under his beard so you could not see them. It actually looked like a bird cage!!!  Thats when I found out why they called him Tweety! He washed out his beard and applied the Can you Handlebar classic scent beard dry oil to his beard. We hung out together the rest of the night and actually for the next 2 days. H&amp;#34;e loved this!!!! He said &amp;#34;Im glad i could win something cool by doing something stupid in front of somebody so pretty&amp;#34; I talked to him a few days ago and he still loves it! He said his beard feels soft and he can make it do whatever he wants it to. AND BOY DID IT SMELL GOOD!!!! I received this product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. My opinions and all thoughts reflected in this review are solely my own.</li>
