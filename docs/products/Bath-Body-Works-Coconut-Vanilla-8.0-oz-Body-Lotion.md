<li> The scent is a little heavier than I remembered.  </li>
<li> The coconut is hardly there</li>
<li> Sad it is hard to come by.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ll admit I was skeptical about this product; but decided to buy it because I LLLOVE vanilla.</li>
<li> :(</li>
<li> Smelling it, I am disappointed.  </li>
<li> Very boring scent.  </li>

    <li> Love it smells great and moisterizes well.</li>
    <li> Like the scent, but doesn&#x27;t moisturize well.</li>
    <li> I was happy to have seen this signature collection online as they stopped selling it at bath and body works. It smells fresh and summery. I received the product in a timely manner. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit I was skeptical about this product; but decided to buy it because I LLLOVE vanilla. I was also worried that the lotion would just feel like water but actually the smell is AMAZING and it actually moisturizes and I don&#x27;t have to cake my body with it to work. GREAT SMELL~this is NOW my FAVORITE!</li>
    <li> For more years than I care to remember, I have tried every coconut scented body lotion that I&#x27;ve come across.  This was not the Coconut scent I was hoping for.  Fiji is the truest to that sweet, warm, tropical scent.</li>
    <li> Very Pleasant scent-- makes you think of the tropics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good price for a good product.</li>
    <li> It smells really good and leaves me skin feeling very soft! I love it!!</li>
    <li> I loved it I mixed it with vanilla smells great!!</li>
    <li> Great smell that lasts!</li>

    <li> Best scent. I love this lotion. Sad it is hard to come by.</li>
    <li> My favorite lotion from bath and body works!! I love coconut and so this is perfect for me.</li>
    <li> Loved this Product! I normally buy Plumeria...which is my FAVORITE, but it&#x27;s prices jumped up to over $30!!!!! WHO WOULD PAY THAT MUCH FOR A SMALL BOTTLE OF LOTION-that use to be $6? Come on bath n body...You are better then that!! I want my Plumeria back to it&#x27;s normal price!!!!...:(</li>
    <li> Just as I hoped for. Thanks for the prompt delivery! :)</li>
    <li> Bath and Body is always great needed an add on gift</li>

    <li> This arrived on time and as described. It was direct shipped as a gift.</li>
    <li> The scent is a little heavier than I remembered.  Musky not my scent but good product.</li>
    <li> Seller did a fine job, I just don&#x27;t love this lotion.  I am so crazy about the berry vanilla, and I was wanting something sweet and coconut.  The Aruba coconut currently in stores isn&#x27;t really sweet like I wanted, so I thought this would be perfect.  Smelling it, I am disappointed.  The coconut is hardly there (my friend couldn&#x27;t smell it at all).  Very boring scent.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just the scent, or if this bottle is older and the smell has faded, as it sometimes can.</li>
