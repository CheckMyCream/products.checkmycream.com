      <li>Good thing</li>
      <li>That said, I still think this is a wise purchase.</li>

      <li>I love this ponytail holder!</li>

      <li>This is the easiest, most versatile hair accessory I have had the pleasure of using!</li>
      <li>I love the product!</li>
      <li>One of the best things about these versus claw clips is that they don&#x27;t stick out so much from your head.</li>
      <li>I tried the holder on it&#x27;s own, and it didn&#x27;t hold well AT ALL.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s a bit of a challenge to get it all through the hole without catching.</li>
      <li>My hair holds it in place nicely.  </li>
      <li>Plus it looks a bit too 80&#x27;s to me like those ponytail cones that used to be popular.</li>
      <li>It is nice to wrap around a pony tail.  </li>
      <li>But even if it worked as advertised, it wouldn&#x27;t have held my hair in any kind of shape or style.  </li>
      <li>Very easy</li>
      <li>It is pretty easy to use and looks great!  </li>
      <li>It has a really great hold and makes your hair look neat, well-kept, and of course pretty.</li>
      <li>When I used to perm my hair, I&#x27;m sure this would have held with no problems.</li>
      <li>even fit all my hair!</li>
      <li>then I place this ponytailer over the top and tighten.</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>I PLAN TO BUY MORE</li>
      <li>MUCH better.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s adorable on her!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I love using this when my hair is longer.  </li>
      <li>Love these to hold my hair as they do NOT cause any breakage.</li>
      <li>I ordered three more</li>
      <li>I wish I&#x27;d order more.</li>
      <li>I still like the device and recognize it will work significantly better for thicker hair.</li>
      <li>I wish they came in more colors.</li>
      <li>THE BETTER I&#x27;LL</li>
      <li>I love this one too.</li>
      <li>so I would be able to keep one</li>
      <li>Received on time and I love it.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more of a ponytail cover.</li>
      <li>Keeping it because it is nice when I have an updo full of curls</li>
      <li>I also tried putting my hair in a bun with it, as shown on the package, but although I was successful in putting it on, it didn&#x27;t hold at all - gently shaking my head</li>
      <li>It makes very quick work of getting my hair in a ponytail, and it is so cute.</li>
      <li>However, for most people, it should work just fine.</li>
      <li>I do wish the ponytailer was available in more colors.  </li>
      <li>it is so cheap though:).</li>
      <li>The item was just perfect and it works exactly as expected.</li>
      <li>I found I like the colorful, glittery kind.</li>
      <li>So easy to use and to carry in your purse because it expands.</li>
      <li>that is the only way I could secure my hair - and then slip over this ponytailer for a more attractive holder.    </li>
      <li>I liked them at first.  </li>
      <li>Not a problem with longer hair even if fine.  </li>
      <li>It stays just fine all day.</li>
      <li>My hair is too fine for this ponytail holder.</li>
      <li>Yea it expands fine-</li>
      <li>I bought it because it purported to hold fine hair well.</li>
      <li>and I have baby fine hair which does not hold well.  </li>
      <li>But it works fine with this product.</li>
      <li>Holds in place just fine.</li>
      <li>With my hair it works fine.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair and when my hair is shoulder length, I need the elastic.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and it&#x27;s comfortable.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is really easy and painless to use and it really looks so much nice than we thought.</li>
      <li>or if your hair isn&#x27;t smooth.</li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t hold my hair up, if it stayed and fit all of my hair</li>
      <li>It will expand to fit your hair</li>
      <li>is plenty secure.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t see how it would keep a bun secure at all like in the picture.</li>
      <li>think I can join Cirque  De Soleil  and do amazing things now thanks to this expandable hair holder.</li>
      <li>We actually found that we really were impressed by how well it worked that my mom begged me to keep the one I bought for myself and to order some more.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Very nice and practical, my daughter likes them and can be used in different ways</li>
      <li>It was probably 3 inches below then where the ponytail originally was in a matter of 10</li>
      <li>- I&#x27;m pretty sure anyway.</li>
      <li>I have very fine, straight, shoulder-length hair and the largest size Scunci (but not the smaller) work surprisingly well for buns if I twist my hair in a spiral before capping it with the expandable Scunci.  </li>
      <li>&amp;#34;color may vary&amp;#34; is absolutely true.</li>
      <li>Its cute because its bright green and is glittery.  </li>
      <li>I am lucky if I make it to work on a foggy, rainy or humid day and still have curls.</li>
      <li>Quick.</li>
      <li>I purchased this expecting to use this by itself to hold the buns or pony tails like shown in the picture, but quickly I learned it will not happen, ever.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not expensive, so worth trying out!</li>
      <li>and I am going to give one to the teen baby sitter who liked it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Wish there were a way to specify a different color, but that&#x27;s my own preference.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I purchased this expecting to use this by itself to hold the buns or pony tails like shown in the picture, but quickly I learned it will not happen, ever. I have a lot of hair, length at about 6 inches below shoulder, straight. When I used this thing by itself-- first, it doesn&#x27;t hold well. It didn&#x27;t even hold the shape. Then, it quickly loosened up I move (turn heads, walk, etc), eventually fall down, for pony tails or buns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if I use an elastic band to tie my hair to a pony tail first, this did not stay on. Since it is not elastic (does not contract), again, as I turn my head, walk, jump, run, it loosened up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I use a elastic band to tie my hair to a (large) bun first, this thing can help the bun stay in tack longer. However, this requires it to be at the fully open position, because any less than fully open, it is going to loosen up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am guessing the only way to make this work is If you plan to wrap a hair scrunchy outside of it. But whats the point of buying this if I have to do that?</li>
    <li> This thing doesn&#x27;t work at all. It doesn&#x27;t hold my hair tight enough. It just falls out. And I have very thick hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this at my local box store.  It doesn&#x27;t work at all for me.  I have long, thick hair.  I tried to use it for a bun and I didn&#x27;t even get out of the bathroom before my hair fell down.  Then I tried a ponytail - wouldn&#x27;t hold it without an elastic, and when I was trying it over an elastic the \\&quot;exandable ponytailer\\&quot; fell apart.  All in all this piece of junk lasted less than half an hour.</li>
    <li> This is a fun little accessory. Like another reviewer said, be careful if you have curly hair. I have very thick and long curly hair and it&#x27;s a bit of a challenge to get it all through the hole without catching. On the other hand, it holds quite well if I use it to make a bun - which is normally very hard to do with my hair unless I use about a hundred bobby pins. I think it would be better if the ponytailer had more sections or somehow the ability to open wider, yet still close securely and firmly. However, for most people, it should work just fine.</li>
    <li> I agree with the reviewer who said you still need an elastic underneath.  It&#x27;s easy to put on, but it expands too easily and doesn&#x27;t hold my hair together, which is too bad, because it is pretty.  Even with my hair braided, it--sadly--kept trying to open.  I don&#x27;t see how it would keep a bun secure at all like in the picture.</li>
    <li> I purchased this ponytail holder at CVS. It was something different, and looked fairly simple to use. I have thin/fine hair that&#x27;s shoulder length. I tried the holder on it&#x27;s own, and it didn&#x27;t hold well AT ALL. In fact, in the time it took me to walk from the bathroom into my kitchen, it had already started to loosen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took it out and put my hair in a regular ponytail using a standard elastic band, then slid the expandable holder over top and closed it around the elastic...MUCH better. If you&#x27;re going to wear this holder, I definitely recommend doing it this way. You can&#x27;t see the elastic underneath at all, and you&#x27;re hair is plenty secure. It&#x27;s more of a ponytail cover. While it&#x27;s not the greatest hair accessory I&#x27;ve ever seen, it&#x27;s not the worst...and it IS something different. I recommend it if you happen to see it at a local store in town, but I certainly wouldn&#x27;t go out of my way to purchase this...and I DEFINITELY wouldn&#x27;t pay shipping for it.</li>
    <li> I was instantly excited about the prospect of finding a new hair item that would hold my bun up -- I get tired of bobby pins and boring hair claws!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine hair, and not even that much of it -- and this little \\&quot;ponytailer\\&quot; couldn&#x27;t hold up for me to even turn my head to assess my new \\&quot;style\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with the other reviews - you can use this for a ponytail (with the elastic band, as the other two reviews say) but it&#x27;s just not happening for a bun. I have no idea how they managed to get that picture on the package...but I&#x27;d take the thing back if it were worth my time.</li>
    <li> make your pony tail sit higher on your head</li>
    <li> If a quick hair change is what you need this will do it, Showed it to some people and they were surprised how easy it was, I bought another one.</li>
    <li> A few reviewers said they need an elastic band when using this item.  I have fine hair and when my hair is shoulder length, I need the elastic. When my hair is longer, no elastic bands are needed and it works great either as a ponytail holder or a bun holder.  I love using this when my hair is longer.  I get my hair cut maybe 3 times a year, so the length varies.  Most if the time my hair is in a simple bun. This is very secure and lightweight; I can barely tell I am wearing it.  I really like it.  I believe if your hair is shorter and fine textured, additional elastic may be necessary to secure it.  Not a problem with longer hair even if fine.  It&#x27;s not expensive, so worth trying out!</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for these - bought at walmart.  Put them in, they don&#x27;t hold your hair tightly at all, I have very long heavy thick curly hair, and all those teeth got tangled up in my hair - and it was behind my head, so I couldn&#x27;t see what I was doing to get it out. I ended up having to break it into pieces to get it out.  But even if it worked as advertised, it wouldn&#x27;t have held my hair in any kind of shape or style.  awful.</li>
    <li> It is pretty easy to use and looks great!  But it slides out of my hair. I put in  in as tight as possible, but within a  few minutes, it slides down and falls out.  I guess if you have curly hair it might work.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit awkward getting the scunci into my hair.  Once in the scunci slowly slides out.  If my hair were thick and heavy I think it would work better.  Doesn&#x27;t work very well with my thin fine hair.</li>
    <li> Very nice and practical, my daughter likes them and can be used in different ways</li>
    <li> Saw this at the store recently and thought it looked interesting, bought it, took it home and tried it out. First I had issues getting my hair through nicely then I find that it&#x27;s  slipping \\&quot;Expandable ponytailer for professional all day hold\\&quot; so not true. I looks cool though, spend a while fiddling with it last night.</li>
    <li> I wish I could put less than one star but I guess this is it. I destroyed it in anger because it was truly a piece of crap. Definitely not for curly hair and I should have seen that when I saw white women on the cover. Take that as a sign. It is just a hinged, round comb. It does not lock or snap closed. It will expand to fit your hair but you cannot make it tight around any ponytail and if your hair is thick it will just stay expanded not close into a ponytail. Maybe if you use a separate rubber band it will work as decoration only.</li>
    <li> Good, delivered. Thanks. Item arrived exactly as expected. No complaints.</li>
    <li> Like the other reviewers said, there is no hold to this clip. You need a rubberband underneath, and after that, what is the point? Plus it looks a bit too 80&#x27;s to me like those ponytail cones that used to be popular. I have curlier hair and it was hard to get all of my hair in the opening and the clip wouldn&#x27;t stay closed. Good thing it is so cheap though:).</li>
    <li> This type of ponytail holder does works well in my hand while creating a bun. However, for my hair, it could be slightly larger and thicker to better hold my hair in place.</li>
    <li> This works great for my two girls hair.  They have thick beautiful hair --one with straight hair the other has curly hair.  First I place their hair into a rubber hair band then I twist their hair up into a bun, next I place the expandable ponytailer over it.  It works beautifully without the use of bobby pins!!! It hold their hair in place while they dance around at their classes.  They are only 3 and 5 so bobby pins are a pain to use.  I highly recommend this product.  I bought four total.</li>
    <li> Does not hold thick hair at all.  I have tried it when my hair is curly (Natural) and when I have straightened it.  My hair is too heavy, the device does not tighten well enough to stay put.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something that looks more attractive than a scrunchi and not pull on my hair/give me a headache.    It is important to wear a regular band underneath - that is the only way I could secure my hair - and then slip over this ponytailer for a more attractive holder.    I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because it&#x27;s not fantastic and out of this world because it is just made of plastic, but if you want something that looks a lot better than wearing a band, this is it.</li>
    <li> This item is awesome!  It makes very quick work of getting my hair in a ponytail, and it is so cute.</li>
    <li> I like this clip.  It is nice to wrap around a pony tail.  The only problem is for is that I still need to put my hair up with an elastic first and then put this around the elastic.  I don&#x27;t know if that is the way it is meant to be used or if it is because my hair is on the long/heavy side.  But I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> If you have thin hair maybe this would work but thick curly hair like mine, no way. It catches putting it in it doesn&#x27;t hold my hair up, if it stayed and fit all of my hair I could overlook the trouble getting it in but I can&#x27;t even do a ponytail let alone the bun style the package show. Just FYI I don&#x27;t have fake hair or anything just thick curly hair.</li>
    <li> Received on time and I love it.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> USE this just sometimes. When I think my hair gets longer I will use this quite a&lt;br /&gt;bit, I like how it works, great concept. Thank you very much</li>
    <li> Really like this but I have thin hair and it tends to fall down and I have to keep adjusting. If you have normal hair this is for you.</li>
    <li> this holds tight and works great for my hair now that it is long enough to pull up. older, have long thin hair, i recommend it</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay in my hair very well.</li>
    <li> These are great!  I have 2 grown daughters and we all use them after we wash our hair.  We all have really thick coarse wavy hair that we straighten almost everyday, and its exhausting!  With this, we can just pull wet hair back into pony or bun and slowly straighten bits of hair, starting from the front and squeeze or expand  as we go along, and it looks great if we want to go out and our hair is wet.  We get to decide what we want, bun or pony and how much we want to leave out and straighten because no matter what size we need it to be,  it holds everything tightly in place....for all of us.  Same when hair is dry and straightened, if we want pony or bun, this is so quick, easy and holds securely.  I definitely recommend this....unless you are using on thin dry hair, I have no idea how it would hold up...but for us it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I love this ponytail holder! It has a really great hold and makes your hair look neat, well-kept, and of course pretty. I&#x27;m so glad someone invented this! It&#x27;s definitely a nice change from traditional scrunchies/hair ties.     If you have curly hair be a little careful while pulling your hair through the center. My curls make it through just fine without getting caught as long as I don&#x27;t pull the hair through super fast.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It holds hair without damaging it and it stays in place. I wish they made a bigger size, because once my hair got past my armpits, the bun would no longer fit into the ponytailer. If your bun is bigger than about 2.5&amp;#34; in diameter, this ponytailer will be too small to hold it. I don&#x27;t use it for ponytails, so I can&#x27;t comment on that.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly. Just as described.</li>
    <li> Yea it expands fine- but it doesn&#x27;t stay retracted after you have it in place. Also it is can be pain in the neck to use on the go or if your hair isn&#x27;t smooth.</li>
    <li> easy to use very good material do not break  become loose like other kinds which i tried before but for a thick hair like mine it does not go with a bun</li>
    <li> I used this, but I have thin hair so it slips a bit. If you have thicker hair, it will probably hold well.</li>
    <li> I am lucky if I make it to work on a foggy, rainy or humid day and still have curls. If I don&#x27;t, I pull my hair back in a chignon or ponytail. My hair is shoulder length, curly and just starting to gray. I bought this little hair ornament to have a different look with my chignon. With my hair it works fine. I keep one of these in my purse for hair emergencies and one at home as a backup. But I agree with other reviewers, that to do a ponytail you may need to use a hair band or skinny scrunchie first. That said, I still think this is a wise purchase.</li>
    <li> I love this one too. It&#x27;s easy to use and it&#x27;s comfortable. I wish they came in more colors. I wish I&#x27;d order more.</li>
    <li> I love it, but I have the small ones which comes in a 2 piece set (in different colors too like dark purple, blue, green, dark red, and the black and brown ones bought at K-mart and Walgreens and HyVee has them in - at least - pink and purple with glitter).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This big one is to large for my hairtype. I haver very thin, long hair and use them with a regular ponytail to get my braided or open hair in a bun. Just twist your hair around the ponytail and put this thing over it, so that it grabs some of the hair around the ponytail. It stays put all day long.</li>
    <li> It makes your life easier... In few seconds you have a very nice hair style; besides this product is much better than the usual hair bands which cause so much breakage in the hair...</li>
    <li> This product is kinda cool at first... but it&#x27;s really small and does&#x27;t even fit all my hair! But i guess since its cheep you might as well get it :/</li>
    <li> I liked them at first.  I have fine, thin hair, so it didn&#x27;t have a lot of stress to hold it, but whenever I would tighten it enough to hold the ponytail, it would snap.  The plastic is brittle or something.  Not recommended.</li>
    <li> If you have long thick hair, like I do, this product is not for you. It&#x27;s hard to find hair clips of any kind that can hold all my hair.</li>
    <li> My seven year old niece gave me one of hers that she got in a little girls hair styling kit and I love it. Its cute because its bright green and is glittery.  Its also great for my hair, and it makes my hair look tamer. Mine is really thick and when I use hair bands, they tend to get tangled and I end up pulling out some of my hair. This thing doesn&#x27;t get tangled at all and I have no problems. It works better for thick hair than thin hair as evidenced in other reviews. Every once in a while I have to tighten it in my hair, otherwise it never fall out. I want more but not black and brown. I found I like the colorful, glittery kind. If anyone finds those please let me know!</li>
    <li> My grand-niece loves this.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> A necessity for woman on the go and can use it with a pony tail or a bun. So easy to use and to carry in your purse because it expands. I love the product!</li>
    <li> The product arrived earlier than excepted which was a plus but came damage into tiny little pieces... waste of money in my opinion.</li>
    <li> My hair is too fine for this ponytail holder.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these then I lost it to my mother who tried it and just LOVED it so much she was like order some more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I ordered three more so I would be able to keep one and I am going to give one to the teen baby sitter who liked it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mother and I both have a lot of hair as does our teen sitter, who actually has to get her hair thinned out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far we have not encountered any issues with the product not keeping our hair in place or falling apart.  We actually found that we really were impressed by how well it worked that my mom begged me to keep the one I bought for myself and to order some more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is really easy and painless to use and it really looks so much nice than we thought.</li>
    <li> If I have to use an elastic under it, what&#x27;s the point?  It doesn&#x27;t hold anything - it loosens up and the ponytail sags.</li>
    <li> I bought this item at Target and paid about $6 for the Brownish and Black pair.  I thought how pretty they would be and only a few dollars for each one.  Was I WRONG!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick hair and very long hair(down to the middle of my back almost).  So I thought how cute these would be as PonyTail holders, and was for sure that due to my hair being thick the claws in the holder would be a \\&quot;no fail\\&quot; situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only was it a nightmare trying to pull my hair thru it (claws kept catching onto my hair while trying to pull it thru), but once I had it on and closed into my hair...I was no more then down the hallway and the ponytail had already started to fall.  It was probably 3 inches below then where the ponytail originally was in a matter of 10 mins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave them to my sister, as her hair is thinner and shorter than my hair.  But it was even worse with hers.  Her hair being thinner had the holders just sliding out.  They wouldnt really grasp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is NO way to wear this without an elastic or two, and then put this over it.  This is for decoration only, and if you dont have thin elastics they show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, but I dont recommend this product to anyone............</li>
    <li> I picked one of these up at the local drug store, and tried to follow the directions.  Even with it opened as wide as possible, it was impossible to pull my ponytail through it without it catching, and it fell apart before I was able to do it.  Technically it didn&#x27;t break, as it was possible to put it back together, but there wasn&#x27;t much point in that, as it came apart again as soon as I tried to use it - I tried a few times.  I also tried putting my hair in a bun with it, as shown on the package, but although I was successful in putting it on, it didn&#x27;t hold at all - gently shaking my head was enough to get it to fall out.  It might work on medium length and/or thin hair, which seems to be what&#x27;s shown on the package, but it&#x27;s completely useless for my long thick hair, despite the claim on the package that it can \\&quot;adjust to all hair types\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I LIKE THIS SCUNCI ALTHOUGH IT DON&#x27;T HOLD MY PONYTAIL TIGHT ENOUGH BUT STILL IS A GOOD PRODUCT. I PLAN TO BUY MORE MAYBE THE LONGER I USE IT THE BETTER I&#x27;LL GET WHEN PUTTING IT ON MY PONYTAIL</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over two years.  I found this new batch of clips to be a bit smaller and they are not staying together.  When they fall apart, it is almost impossible to put them back together again.</li>
    <li> It can nnot hold the hair, because it is so loose. I am very disappointed at this product. It doesn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
    <li> O.k.  Worked great on my thick hair the first few times then wouldn&#x27;t keep a firm grip anymore. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for anyone with thick hair.</li>
    <li> I expected it would arrive in brown colour, but then I read colours may vary, so I got it in black colour. Guess what? black is even better when you come think of it. I love it and it holds my hair up perfectly.</li>
    <li> Yeah. It didn&#x27;t work for my hair. Fell right out even with an elastic in my hair. So I tossed it on the bed intending to throw it in the bin, but my cat caught it. At least she has a new favorite toy.</li>
    <li> Works great and I have baby fine hair which does not hold well.  But it works fine with this product.</li>
    <li> I like the concept and the material is nice but the product opens too easily as other reviews have mentioned. It is a different way to hold a pony and it seems as it wouldn&#x27;t break your hair as much as other things like rubber bands would. Keeping it because it is nice when I have an updo full of curls but that is only because I have numerous pins in it as well. Hopefully the company will modify it and make it better because I do like it overall.</li>
    <li> This is the easiest, most versatile hair accessory I have had the pleasure of using! I use it every day. It&#x27;s so great that I quickly purchased a second one to make sure I have a spare, Both of the ones I received were black. Wish there were a way to specify a different color, but that&#x27;s my own preference. This device looks so cool and keeps my layered long hair up all day and night! I highly recommend this for anyone with hair long enough to be put up!</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;color may vary&amp;#34; is absolutely true. I wanted a brown shade and received black. I would not reorder based on this.</li>
    <li> Perfect for bad hair days or anytime.</li>
    <li> I know this was a simple purchase, but I could not find one in my area. I live in the hills of WV and we have only one store in our town of less than 1,000 folks, so I just could not find what I needed. Amazon ALWAYS comes through for me tho. The item was just perfect and it works exactly as expected. I have super long hair and wear ponytails a lot, so this item was much needed. Thanks for having what I needed and at such a reasonable price. I highly recommend you as an online seller.</li>
    <li> Cool little clip to put your hair in a bun or just pull it back.  I prefer to use it for a bun, personally.</li>
    <li> These are basically a waste of money. If you have REALLY thick hair, they MIGHT hold, but otherwise, they don&#x27;t stay in very well. My hair is normal thickness and when I straighten my hair and use this thing, it is 100% useless. It only stays in if I don&#x27;t move my head AT ALL. When I have my natural, thicker curls, it stays a little better, but not much. Instead of sliding out quickly, it slides out slowly. Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
    <li> Only 4 stars because it doesn&#x27;t hold a bun as depicted in the photo on the product. I have extremely thin hair and it will hold a ponytail, but you will need to tighten it up throughout the day if not wearing a rubber band underneath it. I still like the device and recognize it will work significantly better for thicker hair. When I used to perm my hair, I&#x27;m sure this would have held with no problems. It&#x27;s attractive as a pony tail holder. It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t have enough grip to hold a bun in place, so I&#x27;m not sure how the lady in the photo has her hair held by this product (perhaps with bobby pins in addition to the holder. It is also quite small even for thin hair like mine, but then again my hair is long (to my waist). I hope this is helpful.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the black color I got.  It is really small. I had a larger one before.  This is useless if you have thick or wavy hair.</li>
    <li> I needed something to provide a firm foundation for a long hair piece/ponytail enhancer. This was ideal. Great foundation and support. It stays put! Even with my fine, thin hair.</li>
    <li> This does not work good in my thin, waist length hair!!!! Made a pony and put in and it slide out and got tangled.. It&#x27;s just cheap plastic with poor grip.. Very disappointed!!</li>
    <li> It works well enough for a ponytail, so long as you have an elastic in it. I can&#x27;t use it for a bun, as it barely covers a bun when fully open. Since it won&#x27;t cost at all over a bun, it won&#x27;t stay in.</li>
    <li> I love these! I have fine hair but it&#x27;s medium thickness if that makes sense. In other words though the texture of my hair is fine, I have a lot of hair. It&#x27;s a couple of inches past my bra band in the back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pull my hair up on top of my head, toward the back (a bit higher than the woman on the package) - you can do it loosely or tight, I use a small elastic to hold it in place then I twirl the ponytail and wrap it around the base of the ponytail then I place this ponytailer over the top and tighten. It stays just fine all day. Occasionally I might have to reach up and tighten it a bit but it never feels like it&#x27;s going to fall out. Also, with some other hair holders, when you remove them they take a bit of hair with them and I&#x27;ve not had that happen with this ponytailer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My stepniece who has thicker hair than mine puts hers up in two high ponytails and then does the same thing. It&#x27;s adorable on her!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I happened to find two packs of two each of these at a big box store. I broke my last one about a year ago but I&#x27;d used it countless times. Afterwards I couldn&#x27;t find these and couldn&#x27;t recall what the name of them was. I&#x27;m so happy to have more! It&#x27;s so much cooler to wear my hair up in the summer. I would absolutely buy these again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the elastics I use along with this ponytailer [[ASIN:B00CBFFHQ4 Goody Ouchless Ponytailer, Tiny Terry, 42 Count]] - I&#x27;m pretty sure anyway. It&#x27;s hard to tell if the actual size is exactly like mine but they look the same to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last thing: One of the best things about these versus claw clips is that they don&#x27;t stick out so much from your head. I hate it especially when I&#x27;m driving and every time I move my head the part of the claw that sticks out catches on the head rest and by the time I get where I&#x27;m going, my hair has to be re-situated in the claw.</li>
    <li> I love this product..have one in black and one in tortoise shell. I put my hair in an elastic band, then twist it into a bun and put this over it. Holds in place just fine.</li>
    <li> This product was really hard to put on. My girlfriend didn&#x27;t like it, neither did I. And I think our votes matter!</li>
    <li> Love these to hold my hair as they do NOT cause any breakage. Quick. Easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I can join Cirque  De Soleil  and do amazing things now thanks to this expandable hair holder.</li>
    <li> I have very fine, straight, shoulder-length hair and the largest size Scunci (but not the smaller) work surprisingly well for buns if I twist my hair in a spiral before capping it with the expandable Scunci.  I can even do a Victorian style bun by lowering my head and brushing my hair backwards into a topknot, again with a twist and tucking the ends under the bun created by twisting.  The few strands and tastles that do cascade down or that I pull to loosen the look just serve to soften the &amp;#34;up-do&amp;#34;.  Very easy and I am not one to fuss or spend time on this stuff and would never use hair spray.  I hope they keep making these forever!</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s my technique&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pull my thin, fine hair into a ponytail with a fabric scrunchie.  Then I twist the ponytail hair around the scrunchie to form a bun.  Then I place the expandable ponytailer over the bun as a bun-holder.  It works just great this way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I do wish the ponytailer was available in more colors.  White and clear in particular would be useful.  :-)</li>
    <li> THIS IS GREAT AND GREAT PRICE</li>
    <li> Not recommended for straight hair.  It will slide off.  Would recommend if you have wavy or curly hair, but imagine it could get tangled during removal.</li>
    <li> I use this around a bun after I&#x27;ll put my hair in the ponytail (basic elastic) and loosely twist it around - I have very thick and inconsistently wavy hair. It actually works pretty well for this purpose! I also discovered that if I have put my hair up while it&#x27;s still slightly wet, it makes a really cute voluminous ponytail after I take it out. For the cost, I think it&#x27;s worth it to try it if you have hair like me. Throwing away those horrible clam clips!!</li>
    <li> I have thick, shoulder-lenght hair. I bought this gadget but due to the hair&#x27;s thickness, the prongs cannot be pushed in (and I tried it both ways) and the holder cannot be closed up sufficiently to hold hair at all. It falls out in 5 seconds flat.</li>
    <li> I have long, fine hair and this holder was useless. I bought it because it purported to hold fine hair well. You can pull the hair through (though it kind of hurts to do so because the holder doesn&#x27;t expand enough), and close it, but after about five minutes it starts to slip out. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Buy some elastics instead.</li>
    <li> It just does not hold. Such a waste of money! I wish I had read the reviews before I got the thing.</li>
    <li> I like this once its in my curly hair.  My hair holds it in place nicely.  I gave another to my straight haired friend and hers wouldn&#x27;t stay in.  Kinda stinks either way.</li>
