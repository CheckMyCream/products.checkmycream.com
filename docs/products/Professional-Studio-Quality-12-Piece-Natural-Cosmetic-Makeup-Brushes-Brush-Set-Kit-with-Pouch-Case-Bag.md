      <li>Fantastic product - came just as described and the brushes are beautiful and soft.</li>
      <li>The brushes are really huge.</li>
      <li>Cheap and works well.</li>
      <li>This was a very nice set of brushes, especially for the price.</li>
      <li>There is a nice assortment of brushes and they are very soft.</li>
      <li>Surprisingly good quality for such an inexpensive set.</li>
      <li>For the price, they are not bad brushes.  </li>
      <li>Exactly what I expected, good quality, good price, the bristles are super soft, I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Just keep in mind that although the quality of these brushes are a great deal for the price, they are not professional quality but still very soft and usable.</li>
      <li>The brushes are soft and smooth on the skin, allowing just the right amount of makeup to go on.</li>
      <li>My little sister loved the set.</li>
      <li>Many repeats and they do smell when you first open them.</li>
      <li>and I got it pretty fast!</li>
      <li>I do recommend washing them first.  </li>
      <li>No weird smell in my brushes.</li>

      <li>Well I&#x27;ve had these brushes for about 4-5 months now and they really have gone downhill.</li>
      <li>Thought these might be like Eco Tools, but they&#x27;re much more rough and kinda make your face itchy.  </li>
      <li>Nice stiff bristles to work with.</li>
      <li>The misses loved it and uses it every day.&lt;br /&gt;She even noticed when she left it in the car and was sad that we sent the car to get repaired, but luckily I checked and grabbed the package.</li>
      <li>I bought  this as a XMas gift for my 17 year old daughter.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re also pretty rough on the skin, I definitely wouldn&#x27;t say they&#x27;re soft.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product to anyone , especially those who suffer from acne or have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>The pouch might get dirty over time because it is a very light off white color, but it goes with the natural bamboo look of the brushes.</li>

<li> A lil of the bristles fall out when I use it and they&#x27;re not soft.</li>
<li> Some bristles come loose with initial use, but that was expected.</li>
<li> Hard to find natural brushes of this quality at this price.</li>
<li> She&#x27;s got very delicate skin and can only use natural brushes so her skin doesn&#x27;t break out or damaged.</li>
<li> The only negative thing she has said about the brushes are some of them leave bristles on her face after applying makeup.</li>
<li> Sadly, I would not repurchase.</li>
<li> They shed like crazy and the hairs stick to my skin every time I use these.</li>
<li> The bristles keep falling off - disappointed with the purchase</li>
<li> I always condition these after I wash them, so I&#x27;m disappointed that they&#x27;re performing how they are.</li>
