      <li>For these reasons, it looks absolutely amazing underneath my Armani luminous CC cream, which I also highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Its a great cream don&#x27;t need much and it makes my face feel very soft...</li>
      <li>This cream is thick and works great!  </li>
      <li>Product came quickly.</li>
      <li>I use this face cream along with the Yalmeh Aloe Super Youth Eye Cream.</li>
      <li>with all the money I save I can get twice as much!!</li>
      <li>It does not feel fresh and hydrating but rather like a think grease that will gunk your skin pores.  </li>
      <li>As a woman who has many, many, skin problems: acne, eczema, fine lines, dry skin, sensitive skin, etc.</li>
      <li>Not sure all the pulling to smooth it around is good for the skin.</li>
      <li>(I usually have to apply Smashbox primer before foundation, but not any more!!)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super light and my face feels super smooth and tight...</li>
      <li>BUT THE FIRST TIME I ORDERED IT</li>
      <li>I generally find that they are accurate.</li>
      <li>My skin has a little of all of that, and I have seen a HUGE improvement!!</li>
      <li>I love the ingredients and this will help if you have very dry skin.  </li>
      <li>it is amazing just by the result of its use for the week, my facial skin is tightened, especially I noticed that the skin over the lips.</li>
      <li>And when you wake up in the morning it is still soft and fresh feeling.  </li>
      <li>The cream is not irritating, not drying to the skin, and non-comedogenic.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>it feels very think and gunky.  </li>
      <li>I am wondering if the reviews are real reviews.</li>
      <li>When living in Florida, you can never have too much sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>(By the way, it doesn&#x27;t take much at all.)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been about 2 weeks since I first got this, and I&#x27;ve been using this every night, and my acne scars are fading, uneven tones are brighter, and my acne is much more in control.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this cream to ANYONE.</li>
      <li>Because my skin is soo sensitive, I have to use a much lighter cream in the a.m.</li>
      <li>While surfing Amazon, to see what new organic creams might be out there, I came upon Yalmeh Aloe Vera Cream..</li>
      <li>WOW!  WOW!</li>
      <li>Did not like it the consistency was like a paste and was not to thrilled about how it had a hard time even spreading!</li>
      <li>Seal was broken on the tube and even though I ordered the fragrance free formula, the cream had a strong smell that I can only say reminded me of spoiled corn oil (cooking).</li>
      <li>This cream makes your face so soft and touchable.</li>
      <li>I like this face cream quite a lot so far.</li>
      <li>;  (LOL) When I received it, I noticed how very, very, (and I do mean, VERY THICK)</li>
      <li>I generally never spend this much on any beauty product, but I had a gift card</li>
      <li>I have facial lotion that is not as thick but moisturizes a lot better.</li>
      <li>The next morning, my face was so moist and soft, I couldn&#x27;t believe it.</li>

<li> but after you blend it in, it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy.</li>
<li> After a few weeks there is a noticeable improvement with the wrinkles around my eyes and forehead.  </li>
<li> It is a little to thick to use on my face because I have oily skin</li>
<li> It is like a small miracle.</li>
<li> I get random annoying dry patches on my face in the winter and this cleared that right up.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was in need of a good moisturizer and purchased this because of the reviews. I generally find that they are accurate. NOT SO in this case. This stuff goes on like paste! It isn&#x27;t moisturizing at all. I took it with me on vacation and it was a big mistake. It was truly disappointing. I can&#x27;t figure out what everyone is raving about. I am wondering if the reviews are real reviews. I have heard some are skewed on Amazon. I can&#x27;t fathom that anyone thinks this is a good moisturizer. It is AWFUL.</li>
    <li> Seal was broken on the tube and even though I ordered the fragrance free formula, the cream had a strong smell that I can only say reminded me of spoiled corn oil (cooking). Whether this was due to the broken inner seal causing the cream to go rancid or whether that&#x27;s just the natural odor, I don&#x27;t know but I am returning this cream and buying a moisturizer from Ernest Supplies.  Another downside to this moisturizer is the tube is only 1.7oz,</li>
    <li> I generally never spend this much on any beauty product, but I had a gift card so I splurged, and I am pretty happy that I did! I get random annoying dry patches on my face in the winter and this cleared that right up. I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
    <li> it feels very think and gunky.  It does not feel fresh and hydrating but rather like a think grease that will gunk your skin pores.  The smell is quite bad as well, just like old cooking oil.</li>
    <li> Love this face cream great for sensitive and acne prone skin it&#x27;s very light but still moisturizing</li>
    <li> Love it. It&#x27;s super light and my face feels super smooth and tight... And bright!</li>
    <li> Very light weight and comfortable.  It actually has a slightly cooling effect.  Does a good job and, as an added bonus, contains sunscreen.  When living in Florida, you can never have too much sunscreen.  Will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my fifties and I have Rosacea and acne prone skin. This product is fabulous as it is so soothing, no redness, and no breakouts.  For years I had used the same product and was looking for a change. After a few weeks there is a noticeable improvement with the wrinkles around my eyes and forehead.  I use this face cream along with the Yalmeh Aloe Super Youth Eye Cream. Two very nice products.</li>
    <li> Does NOT leave your face shiny........but MAN O MAN does it moisturize!!!!!  I love wearing this at night!!!  WOW!  WOW!</li>
    <li> need to use longer to see if there are any results only been using for almost one week.  Cream is quite thick and a little difficult to get rubbed into skin.</li>
    <li> This cream makes your face so soft and touchable. And when you wake up in the morning it is still soft and fresh feeling.  I love it .  I will continue buying this stuff for a long time.</li>
    <li> It is like smearing playdough onto your face. Smells a bit the same too. It is in to way smooth or creamy. Not sure all the pulling to smooth it around is good for the skin. I would think not. No difference in wrinkles, BUT it doesn&#x27;t make me break out or make my skin oily. So I gave it two stars for that.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the cream for the last few days and I have to say that I love it. I want to address some of the reviews that people are saying, including the comment that says the cream seems to be &amp;#34;exfoliating&amp;#34; or that it is good for &amp;#34;oily skin.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream is not exfoliating, if you find it to be flaking off your face, it&#x27;s probably user error or an incompatible combination of the cream and your sunscreen, and not the cream itself. Let me explain why. This definitely happened to be when I put a sunblock on after putting on the cream. The sunblock seemed to cause the cream to become flake off in patches on my face and I think it&#x27;s either because I didn&#x27;t wait long enough for the cream to sink in to my skin or because the sunblock caused the cream to slough off. Either way, I know that the cream alone is amazing for a variety of reasons. It is super moisturizing, spreads very easily, and is surprisingly mattifying for being so moisturizing. I know this does not seem to make sense, but if you bought the cream and tried it, you would understand what I mean. For these reasons, it looks absolutely amazing underneath my Armani luminous CC cream, which I also highly recommend. The cream is not irritating, not drying to the skin, and non-comedogenic. It actually helped reduce the irritation in my skin that I had from over exfoliating the night before. I also want to say that I think this cream is great for all skin types because it is so moisturizing yet so mattifying. I hope this review helps some people.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A VERY NICE MOITERIZER I LOVE THE NATURALNESS AND ALL THE ORGANIC INGREDIENTS IT IS THICK WHICH I LOKE INSTD OF WATERY--I DO ADD A LITTLE WATER TO THIS IT OUT AND APPLY LEAVES MY SKIN FEELING NICE AND LOOKING GOOD I WILL DEFINETLY RE ORDER THIS</li>
    <li> This cream was just too heavy for my combination skin.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my shipment of this aloe face moisturizer - thanks!</li>
    <li> I LOVE YALMEH PRODUCTS BUT THE FIRST TIME I ORDERED IT IT WAS IN A JARLASTED A LONG TIME, THIS TIME IT WAS A TUBE ONLY LASTED ABOUT A MONTH, I WISH THEY WOULD BRING THE JAR BACK, THIS IS A GREAT FACE MOISTURIZER.</li>
    <li> Its a great cream don&#x27;t need much and it makes my face feel very soft...my skin feels great.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay.  Very very thick and if you keep rubbing it in, it will ball up on your face.  I have facial lotion that is not as thick but moisturizes a lot better.</li>
    <li> I am using it every night, haven&#x27;t seen a difference.</li>
    <li> This cream is thick and works great!  It is a little to thick to use on my face because I have oily skin but it works great for around my eyes and hands!  I love the ingredients and this will help if you have very dry skin.  I love using it for around my eyes and it has helped the skin look better.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer! Highly recommended! I also use the eye cream and I love them both. The moisturizer has a thick consistency so I like to apply it while my face is still a little damp right after washing my face morning and night, then I apply the eye cream. Very friendly and customer friendly staff! BUY NOW! (:</li>
    <li> I love this face cream. I saw immediate results and a wonderful tightening feeling in my skin. It is soft and has a pleasant smell. I will be throwing away all my other face creams even the ridiculously expensive ones. I will be using Yalmeh Face Moisturizer exclusively. It is like a small miracle.</li>
    <li> As a woman who has many, many, skin problems: acne, eczema, fine lines, dry skin, sensitive skin, etc. finding the right anti aging cream that will moisturize my skin, without making it OVERLY oily and send it into acne oblivion, is almost impossible. While surfing Amazon, to see what new organic creams might be out there, I came upon Yalmeh Aloe Vera Cream..I read all of the info : aloe based, vit, C, E, no parabens, it seemed to good to be true..I ordered a jar thinking this would be just another one of the many, many creams that ended up in my &amp;#34;anti aging hoarder bathroom drawer!&amp;#34;  (LOL) When I received it, I noticed how very, very, (and I do mean, VERY THICK) the cream was. So thick, it almost had the consistency of a thick Elmer&#x27;s glue when you&#x27;re trying to spread it, while it&#x27;s drying.. But after I cleansed my face, used my toner and serum, I started to apply this cream, and it spread surprisingly well over my face..(By the way, it doesn&#x27;t take much at all.) The next morning, my face was so moist and soft, I couldn&#x27;t believe it. I thought this cream was going to be way to thick and heavy, especially for hot, humid summers down in Alabama. But no; your skin just drinks this in like water. It&#x27;s been about 2 weeks since I first got this, and I&#x27;ve been using this every night, and my acne scars are fading, uneven tones are brighter, and my acne is much more in control.  I use this as my night time moisturizer, only because it is so thick. It says you can use it day/night. Because my skin is soo sensitive, I have to use a much lighter cream in the a.m. I would highly recommend this cream to ANYONE. I imagine it would be perfect for dry, itchy skin, aging skin, or oily skin. My skin has a little of all of that, and I have seen a HUGE improvement!! Thank you Yalmeh!! My face is all the better!!</li>
    <li> I found this to not be moisturizing enough for my dry patches of skin (cheek area). I would highly recommend for someone with oily skin though, might be a nice fit.</li>
    <li> Product came quickly. It&#x27;s a bit thicker than I am used to, but it does seem to absorb. I would buy it again</li>
    <li> I bought focusing on the reviews and did not regret it. it is amazing just by the result of its use for the week, my facial skin is tightened, especially I noticed that the skin over the lips. minus one he - he smeared hard, but eventually you get used to it</li>
    <li> I like this face cream quite a lot so far. It does a good job. I use it both morning (under my make up and as a night cream.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and great service experience. Thank You!</li>
    <li> Did not like it the consistency was like a paste and was not to thrilled about how it had a hard time even spreading!</li>
    <li> Yalmeh is my new favorite skin care line! This moisturizer is like putting on a primer as well because it gives a matte quality finish. (I usually have to apply Smashbox primer before foundation, but not any more!!) It feels like it seals in moisture.The scent is faint and slightly spicy/floral. The consistency is thick but after you blend it in, it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy. It&#x27;s amazing. I was a Peter Thomas Roth junkie until now... with all the money I save I can get twice as much!!</li>
