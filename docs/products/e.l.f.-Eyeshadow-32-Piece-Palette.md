      <li>They don&#x27;t run too much, but a primer really is recommended.</li>
      <li>This might make a good gift for a 5 year old to play dress up with, but it is no fun for an adult.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I use to live on MAC products and swore by it.</li>
      <li>and I think I will buy all my friends one for the new year too..</li>

      <li>had alot of fun playing with just a few of these colors....</li>
      <li>but it had still lasted me, colors last a long time, and not one of the colors are even near to being gone.</li>

<li> Not what I was expecting the colors are not as pigmented as other elf products</li>
<li> If you know how to apply your eye shadow,  these wont let you down.</li>

<li> It seemed like no matter what brush I used, it applied very unevenly.</li>
<li> The darker matte colors at the bottom of the set are quite packed and hard to get out</li>
<li> sucks, it doesn&#x27;t stay on lid of eyes when applied.</li>
<li> Its just ridiculous to pay $20 for one color.</li>
<li> For anybody venturing into stepping up their makeup game, this is a staple for you.</li>
<li> However, this was beyond useless.</li>
<li> Aside from having very weak pigmentation, the texture of the shadows is just awful.</li>

    <li> Love, love, love!  For anybody venturing into stepping up their makeup game, this is a staple for you. Lots of unique rich colors to play with.</li>
    <li> These eyeshadows are really great.  I use to live on MAC products and swore by it. But being a single mom now all my money goes to my kids. If you know how to apply your eye shadow,  these wont let you down. Dont use the applicator it comes with, word of advice. I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments from younger women when I wear this. Its just ridiculous to pay $20 for one color.</li>
    <li> I really like this palette it gives me lots of choices for makeup and now I can fit my look to my mood.</li>
    <li> I love this pallet its a good eye shadow for the price.</li>
    <li> Get a good eye primer and these colors come thru beautifully</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a Christmas present for my 11 yr old daughter.  (Actually for Grandma to give to my daughter for Christmas:)  The colors are beautiful and the make-up arrived in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> I read reviews on this shadow kit..for the price  I really didn&#x27;t care..I bought 3..I am telling you..I wear urban decay..mac etc..so I know good stuff..ok this is not like mac..but I give it 10 stars..for the price..it is great..def equal to any shadows you buy at walmart..cvs or walgreens..I love it and would buy more !! Remember its 32 colors for a few bucks..and I hate FLAT/ matte colors so I was so happy to see most were on the glossy/shinning side..and I will buy many more from this company..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for over a year and the casing is still intact and the size is pretty convenient. I have this in Brights, and the colors are great. A primer is recommended, though. The applicator in the package is flimsy and cheap, I&#x27;d recommend using a different brush/applicator. The eyeshadow itself is worth what you pay. The shimmery colors(light green, light purple, light blue, brown, white) are pretty loose once you dip a brush in. The darker matte colors at the bottom of the set are quite packed and hard to get out and once you do get a shade out it takes a lot to cover your eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors are great, some are neutral, but the brighter colors really do stand out against skin. They don&#x27;t run too much, but a primer really is recommended.</li>
    <li> The quality is good. The colors seem alike but once you put them on you can see that they are indeed different. You may want to get more eye brushes, one is not enough for 32 colors!! haha Anyway, the packaging was great, so I received it in very good conditions.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect this to be very good, considering the price. However, this was beyond useless. Aside from having very weak pigmentation, the texture of the shadows is just awful. It doesn&#x27;t smooth onto the eyelid at all - it&#x27;s very difficult to blend. It seemed like no matter what brush I used, it applied very unevenly. This might make a good gift for a 5 year old to play dress up with, but it is no fun for an adult.</li>
    <li> My Roommate  and I use this makeup set every day. We love the color pallet in this case!</li>
    <li> This is really nice as this was not very expensive and has a variety of colors. A little goes a long way. i got this as a gift.</li>
    <li> Arrived early, love the assortment of colors. Will be ordering from them again. Great price too.</li>
    <li> sucks, it doesn&#x27;t stay on lid of eyes when applied.</li>
    <li> This variety of colors is great for my whole face!  I use it for brows, eye-lids and under, eye-liner, blush, lipstick [with vasoline over it]</li>
    <li> Lovely palette. I bought one in Neutrals as well. The colors are lovely and for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> I have to add a lot of shadow onto my brush to really see the color. I wish there was more pigment.</li>
    <li> This is a great little palette for the price! Not bad! :)</li>
    <li> This was better than I expected. This is a great product. The colours are more vibrant than pictured. I bought it as a gift and I think I will buy all my friends one for the new year too..</li>
    <li> had alot of fun playing with just a few of these colors....cant wait to play with the res...very satisified!!</li>
    <li> i love dark eye shadow, and this one is like a night palette which is really i wanted!!!!! its easy to colored~!</li>
    <li> I actually bought this eye-shadow a couple of years ago from Marshall&#x27;s and I have the one displayed in the picture. I think it coated me around $7 or $8 but it had still lasted me, colors last a long time, and not one of the colors are even near to being gone. I use it everyday. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Good and worth this price.</li>
    <li> This is a really good palette especially if you are traveling. There is an array of colors to choose from for an occasion. The only reason it&#x27;s not a 5 star product, is because the matte colors are not as pigmented as the shimmer colors. Overall, good product.</li>
    <li> Not what I was expecting the colors are not as pigmented as other elf products</li>
