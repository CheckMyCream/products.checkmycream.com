    <li> Did not fit well. Had to return.</li>
    <li> very happy...no problems...thank you...</li>
    <li> Awesome wig and so soft. Looks better than in the pic.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for a fun night out with the girls and I enjoyed the wig. It looked good, I wouldn&#x27;t wear it all the time but only for a moment.</li>
    <li> Amazing look and feel and great packaging. Super happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> Four of us wore these as part of our uniform for our curling team. The event raised money for local people living with cancer. We looked great &amp; the wigs stayed on well!</li>
    <li> The quality of the wigs were a lot better than I thought it would be! Very soft and pretty comfortable on. Went to a wig party and compared to the other wigs others wore... This was pretty nice. There&#x27;s adjustable bands inside that was really helpful too!</li>
    <li> I would be scared to put any heat on this wig. It looks like the picture except it&#x27;s a lot thinner and there&#x27;s parts where you can actually see the scalp. I was very upset because I like to wear wigs out and this would have been perfect if it were just a little bit thicker.</li>
    <li> I ordered the hot pink they send me the light pink one .not cool .the wig sheds like crazy not one or two strands I&#x27;m talking about chunks .don&#x27;t think this wig will last two months.I still like the color the length.it goes above the shoulder.I love wigs so I&#x27;ll keep it and enjoy it .</li>
    <li> Best wig!! Spr soft! Very very cute!!!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for, arrived in 2 days! Thank you !</li>
    <li> Did not like it. It was not cut properly and hair was falling off</li>
    <li> Great wig. It&#x27;s really soft and doesn&#x27;t shed to much for a synthetic wig. It was a steal for the price. The only big complaint that I had was that it didn&#x27;t take well to styling at all. I mean it didn&#x27;t really style. I left it in curlers for two day and not one curl came out. I still really liked it though. Also if you have dark hair it might kid of show through a little so be weary of that. All and all it was good.</li>
    <li> Fast Shipping!!! I order this on a Sunday. . . Showed up today (Wednesday). Wow... I love my wig. Feels soooo soft. Great quality. coming from a license cosmetologist. I&#x27;m seriously going to buy another one!!!! Love it. Must buy.</li>
    <li> Good quality but shorter than shown.</li>
    <li> My favorite fun hair piece.  Soft silky and just plain fun!</li>
