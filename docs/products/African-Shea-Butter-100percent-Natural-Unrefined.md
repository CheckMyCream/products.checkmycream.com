<li> it daily for dry skin issues.</li>
<li> There was no mess, not melted, nor half used.</li>
<li> it lasts so long for me and my toddler.</li>
<li> no different to the harder butter to which I am accustomed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve only tried one other brand of Shea butter but the difference between the two is night and day.</li>
<li> I buy this only a few times a year as even with daily use</li>
<li> I expected the Dhea Butter to look like this when it arrived, and it did.</li>
<li> This Shea Butter is not like any other that I have ever had.  </li>
<li> $20.00 down the drain!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> The Shea butter had melted out of the container and when I opened it up, the product had black stuff in it.</li>
<li> The product is thick so a little goes a long way.</li>
<li> I still use it just because it would be a waste not to</li>
<li> I use it together with coconut oil on my skin after I shower and there are literally grains left behind.</li>
<li> Got my order container was busted open and product was a mess in the box, hard to use while picking out pieces of plastic!!!</li>
<li> and I took a small one to work and all the scrub techs and nurses</li>
<li> We tried all the usual over the counter ointments, and also cocoa butter</li>
<li> Unfortunately, I deal with you very bad picture shows it raw shea butter yellow and come in a plastic box and this is usual that I used it, I received a white and a bad texture and also in the form of bags very sickening&lt;br /&gt;Lost</li>
<li> I got kinda scared after reading some negative reviews it arrived today</li>
<li> Too bad I can&#x27;t remember the name of the other brand :(</li>
<li> Inappropriate shipping cause breaking the butter tray , it was melted and nothing remained in the bottle unfortunately!</li>
<li> my money on merchandise too bad</li>
<li> I use this as a base for my homemade body and hair creams.</li>
<li> Totally disgusting!</li>
<li> This was the worst batch of Shea Butter I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Product came in an unmarked container ( no label as shown in picture), was under weight and very gritty. Have purchase Shea butter from vender at a local show with this label and was very happy with it and this is why I bought it on amazon. Thought is would be same product. Sent it back for refund.</li>
    <li> I found this is the best bang for the buck! I make most of my own products at home and use shea butter for many of them. This is great and the best price I have found.</li>
    <li> My wife and I developed a skin rash that would not heal. We tried all the usual over the counter ointments, and also cocoa butter&lt;br /&gt;which we had used with success in the past. But the rash started to spread despite all attempts.  My wife&#x27;s friend gave her a small&lt;br /&gt;amount of African Shea Butter to try, and to our amazement it cleared the rash in about 4 days. We ordered some on-line and are&lt;br /&gt;using it daily for dry skin issues. I can&#x27;t tell you how happy we are to have found this product. We even use it on our dog who had&lt;br /&gt;some skin problem, with great success .  Herman &amp; Kelly Ryborz</li>
    <li> good prodact thank you</li>
    <li> This is an excellent  product. We use to help with my daughter&#x27;s severe eczema. She gets relief from the itching and dryness and we can avoid the use of steroids on someone so young. We also use it to seal in moisture on our natural hair. The product is thick so a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> There have reached shea butter, but all expired and musty smell too bad&lt;br /&gt;Not as before&lt;br /&gt;Kindly send other new and to be&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> Great product will recommend to friends</li>
    <li> Works wonderful! I love it and I took a small one to work and all the scrub techs and nurses love it it!&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff.</li>
    <li> I bought this a few years ago, and my tub is STILL GOING STRONG! It&#x27;s so creamy and wonderful. Get it. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> prefer the yellow shea butter, its much smoother, this one is very grainy - label not as shown in the picture&lt;br /&gt;as a matter of fact there was not label.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use anything else on my skin since I discovered this product. I would recommend it to everyone I know.</li>
    <li> This product was of a softer consistency than the Shea butter I am used to.  At first, it feels a bit grainy, but once you start rubbing it in the palms of your hands, the grainy feel quickly disappears leaving a smooth butter which is easy to apply.  I use it on my skin and my hair and so far it has done a fine job- no different to the harder butter to which I am accustomed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I had was that one of the tubs (I got 2 16 oz. for a total of the 32 oz. I purchased) came burst and taped with scotch tape.  when I contacted the seller, they were reasonably prompt in responding.  I sent photos of the damaged product.  I was assured that they had not shipped it like that and was given a reasonable explanation how the item may have been in that state.  The sellers apologized and were ready to provide acceptable redress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the damaged tub, I am happy with the product and the seller and certainly recommend both product and seller.</li>
    <li> I bought this because i tried some a friend of mine had and fell in love. i have eczema and i put this on every night on the spot. i haven&#x27;t felt itchy or gotten red ever since, which is a miracle . works better than any ointment or cream i bought from pharmacy or from dermatologist have even put it on small cuts, and scar, and after time the mark goes away. just love it so much!!</li>
    <li> Inappropriate shipping cause breaking the butter tray , it was melted and nothing remained in the bottle unfortunately!</li>
    <li> I buy this only a few times a year as even with daily use it lasts so long for me and my toddler. I love this product so much that I give it away to family members that I know suffer from dry skin. When my LO was a newborn and having issues with eczema this was the only thing I found that would keep his skin moisturized (though I still had to apply 2x/day) and keep flair ups at bay</li>
    <li> I love the African Shea Butter. It works great on the skin. Keeps skin moist all day. Highly recommended to all.</li>
    <li> I I got kinda scared after reading some negative reviews it arrived today I immediately ..checked it out its great Shea butter with great price ..I&#x27;m glad I ordered it and will order again..thank you!</li>
    <li> this shea butter is all that.  I love it for my hair.  I mix it with olive oil, coco nut oil and put it on my natural hair.  I get wonderful results.  i plan to purchase more in a couple of months or less.  i also use it on my skin daily.  love it.  i mix it with my regular lotion and it lasts all day without having to put on more lotion.  this is worth the price</li>
    <li> it my request&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
    <li> I expected the Dhea Butter to look like this when it arrived, and it did. There was no mess, not melted, nor half used.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I deal with you very bad picture shows it raw shea butter yellow and come in a plastic box and this is usual that I used it, I received a white and a bad texture and also in the form of bags very sickening&lt;br /&gt;Lost my money on merchandise too bad</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a user of African shea butter for years. Great for hair and skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it before but to get his size for the price was well worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only tried one other brand of Shea butter but the difference between the two is night and day. I really liked the first one I ordered but it came in a bag. This one had good reviews and it came in an actual container so I figured \\&quot;why not?\\&quot;. I wish I had just stuck to my original brand. It was cheaper and it came with much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My real issue with this one though it the sand like feeling it leaves after I apply it. I use it together with coconut oil on my skin after I shower and there are literally grains left behind. It&#x27;s like playing in the sand and then putting lotion on... If it weren&#x27;t for that I would rate this higher, as it does moisturize my skin nicely. However, I prefer my Shea butter to have a smooth feel. I still use it just because it would be a waste not to but I won&#x27;t be ordering this one again. Too bad I can&#x27;t remember the name of the other brand :(</li>
    <li> This was the worst batch of Shea Butter I&#x27;ve ever purchased. Never again. I will just go to the local beauty supply store so I can inspect the product before I buy it. The Shea butter had melted out of the container and when I opened it up, the product had black stuff in it. Totally disgusting! I would never put that stuff on my hair or the rest of my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, the product is in the trash. $20.00 down the drain!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buyer beware!!!</li>
    <li> Good quality and nice price! I use this as a base for my homemade body and hair creams. I have never had any issue with the quality of this product.</li>
    <li> Received as displayed. Will purchase again :)</li>
    <li> This Shea Butter is not like any other that I have ever had.  It is gritty and has a smell.  I definitely won&#x27;t be buying this again!</li>
    <li> Not bad ,could be better</li>
    <li> Everything happened just like they said.</li>
    <li> The quality of this product varies from shipment to shipment.  I now use another brand to ensure consistency and clarity.</li>
    <li> Have ordered this before and it is excellent to mix with oil for a great skin softener......and my dog LOVES IT!!!  Not that I feed it to her, but when I put it on my hands she will do anything I command.  Great training product for a vegan.  How strange, I love it and she does too!</li>
    <li> Very useful for the skin ..</li>
    <li> I have purchased many different natural, organic, unrefined shea butters and this one does not smell, look or feel like shea butter at all.</li>
    <li> The high quality product</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.  I melted it and mixed it with my lotion and made some beautiful, skin soaking lotion.  This is kind of hard to melt but with the proper bowl, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> Got my order container was busted open and product was a mess in the box, hard to use while picking out pieces of plastic!!!</li>
    <li> I highly recommend it. I use it twice in a day and works good with me.</li>
    <li> Do not buy. Item is not what&#x27;s displayed in the picture. I received a brownish color &amp; came in 2 blocks inside of a zip lock bag.</li>
    <li> Not the same packing in picture were shipped, also to sticker is not.‎&lt;br /&gt;As product I like it, using it for over ‎‏6‏‎ month and it gives good result ‎</li>
