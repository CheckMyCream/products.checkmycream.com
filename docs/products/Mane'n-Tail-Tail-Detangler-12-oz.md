      <li>Love this stuff!</li>
      <li>This thing is ridiculously awesome for detangling hair so quickly and smoothly!  </li>
      <li>I bought this for my daughter she absolutely loves it, according to her is the best detangler she ever used.</li>
      <li>I spray it on my hair after shamppoing and conditioning (with V05 moisture milk conditioner which is really cheap and good at detangling in the shower).</li>
      <li>Excellent for detangling naturally coily or kinky hair.</li>
      <li>This is the best detangler I have I found fir my daughter&#x27;s natural hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kind of a miracle worker :)</li>
      <li>, my hair is in a texturized state, this product should more than do the trick.</li>
      <li>We both love it.</li>
      <li>and it is FANTASTIC!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like magic how it detangles hair, and I&#x27;ve been using it for over 10 years.</li>
      <li>Best product I&#x27;ve found for detangling my long hair.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m impressed and my hair can get tangled quickly since i have mixed hair type.</li>
      <li>My 4yr old has super curly hair and this is great in the mornings.</li>
      <li>A very good product that doesn&#x27;t weigh down hair or make it greasy, definitely worth ordering.</li>
      <li>I have a lot of fine straight hair that knots up easily.  </li>
      <li>The fragrance is light and fresh, not over powering.</li>
      <li>After reading other reviews about how great this product is I was hopeful it would work for my hair.</li>
      <li>Cannot live without this product, ideal for children with long hair!</li>
      <li>Biewers are just adorable and loving dogs; however, unless one is lucky (or not) to get one with silky hair instead of cottony hair, a tangled mess can ensue unless you comb and brush every day.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this life saving product!!!</li>
      <li>but i didn&#x27;t notice any help in detangling her fine, straight hair after a bath.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Warning: If you have smooth floors where you spray this it will make them really slippery when wearing socks.</li>
      <li>When I used the detangler, it really helped my wide-tooth comb glide so much easier through my hair, it really made detangling so much easier, and it smells good too.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>This product smells like freshly washed hair.</li>
      <li>SO CONVIENT TO HAVE THIS ITEM DELIVERED RIGHT TO YOUR DOOR wouldn&#x27;t be without this my daughter calls it horse spray</li>
      <li>/&gt;Not to be outdone by a simple problem, we thought, so we bought some Mane &#x27;n Tail Detangler and had a much better outlook on keeping our dog groomed.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll definitely rebuy them when these run out, though I&#x27;m assuming I&#x27;ll be able to use it for another year or so before that happens.</li>
      <li>We first tried combing and brushing without help.  </li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t use their other products, the scent of this is a nice, clean smell that is neither masculine nor feminine, so it works on anybody.</li>
      <li>Believe the positive reviews on this.  </li>
      <li>Then we took her to the groomer (I think goomer would be better but....) and found the groomer had little patience with a dog that had more tangles and webs than a spider&#x27;s next.  </li>
      <li>When either one of us suggests a combing or brushing, she is all perky and ready for a comb.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The one thing I notice is that it makes floor tile very slippery.</li>
      <li>Then, I comb through gently, and it works well.</li>
      <li>, I don&#x27;t go through that much spray</li>
      <li>I highly recommend purchasing the pack of 2 since it qualifies for Prime shipping!</li>
      <li>it really works</li>
      <li>really helps on the Westie</li>
      <li>Worked great for getting the matted areas loose after I took my braids down before washing.</li>
      <li>I tried using it on myself as well and don&#x27;t have any of the problems that come with having fine wet hair that just sticks</li>
      <li>Its a small price to pay to be able to get a brush through my hair without tearing it apart.</li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>Just simple water and post instant conditioner left my hair more detangled than the &amp;#34;after&amp;#34; of this Con.  </li>
      <li>This works great on my daughter&#x27;s thick, wavy hair without being greasy or weighing her hair down.</li>
      <li>My hair is more tangled than before I spray this onto my Super thick, BSL, AFRICAN AMERICAN hair, I&#x27;m talking spider web crocheted tangles.  </li>
      <li>made my daughter&#x27;s hair soft</li>
      <li>Works really well and definitely detangles hair.</li>
      <li>but they don&#x27;t sell this near me</li>
      <li>It makes my hair soft and shiny, and.</li>
      <li>When I sprayed it on her and brushed it she had no tears, it took a whole 2 minutes to brush through and she was all smiles.</li>
      <li>main n tail is the one detangler that actually works for me.  </li>
      <li>I can use it with wet or dry hair and it makes my hair smooth in an instant.</li>
      <li>Yeah, a little pricey but worth it.</li>
      <li>I even tried it on my friend&#x27;s 5 yr old daughter who literally screams every time her hair is brushed and it takes about 30 minutes to brush it.</li>
      <li>My two year old will actually let me brush her hair out now.</li>
      <li>I have given this BS enough opportunities( initially purchased two bottles) to live up to the paid advertised hype masquerading as customer reviews.</li>
      <li>Got this for a6 year old daughter who loves her long hair but can&#x27;t take brushing out the tangles.</li>
      <li>Similar products are aimed at children, have strong odors, and generally work poorly.</li>

<li> Similar products are aimed at children, have strong odors, and generally work poorly.</li>
<li> My hair is super thick and curly and without this stuff I would be lost!</li>
<li> But all the detanglers I&#x27;ve tried make my hair flat.  </li>
<li> I am an adult with straight hair a few inches past my shoulders that tangles and snarls constantly.  </li>
<li> This product makes it possible to keep my hair in something other than a very short hair style.</li>
<li> and she looked like a shaved dog; not a professionally groomed dog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> My husband uses this on his long beard and I use it on my long hair.</li>
<li> Made my natural hair easy to handle without being painful.</li>
<li> The other bottle was sealed properly.</li>
<li> Due to my dry hair, I still need extra moisture (maybe almond oil or something) in my hair after I use this to detangle it.</li>
<li> Works well on my wife&#x27;s long wet hair.</li>
<li> Just be careful when spraying over tile or linoleum.</li>
<li> And I know you shouldn&#x27;t comb or brush wet hair since that just damages it, but if I don&#x27;t, it gets so snarled that I have to douse it in detangler to get a comb to go through it and not just get stuck too.</li>
<li> I brought this for my daughter who has 4c natural hair, this is what she had to say about this product, &amp;#34;I have really thick hair</li>
<li> A few sprays are enough to lubricate the hair so my brush glides through with minimal force, so little to no pain.</li>
<li> It really does help the split ends from looking so bad and afterwards my hair feels very soft.</li>
<li> Well, this stuff does the trick, and it smells like the other Mane n Tail products</li>
<li> I tried so many products that would barely help until I got an awful knot the size of a baseball that I thought I&#x27;d never get out.</li>
<li> Down the drain</li>
<li> If I had a disc to ride down a snowy hill this would work, probably like the scene on the Griswald family Christmas.</li>
<li> I bought mane n tail detangler and a few other products</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve noticed a lot less breakage when I comb.</li>
<li> I purchased this product because a reviewer stated that this was a miracle potion that helped to prevent him/her from cutting their locks and instead just combing their hair back to its natural state.</li>
<li> I have very fine.hair that is frosted and almost impossible to comb out when wet, even with a Wet Brush.  </li>
<li> Use this with &amp;#34;The Wet Brush&amp;#34; I just purchased and there will be no more tangles...</li>
<li> crying fits...</li>
<li> Both of those conditioners have coconut oil in them, which while it makes the hair really soft and shiny, it does make getting a comb or brush through my hair difficult when the hair is damp.</li>
<li> I wear my hair up in a bun at work, it&#x27;s long and curly and it tangles so easily causing awful knots.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not easy to find products that work for me.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, Amazon now thinks I own/am a horse and sends copious amounts of horse related product suggestions.</li>
<li> No more.  </li>
<li> It makes a invisible coated surface that is slick as ice.</li>

    <li> Got this for a6 year old daughter who loves her long hair but can&#x27;t take brushing out the tangles. My wife now swears by this stuff!</li>
    <li> Wife said this is the best stuff ever used.</li>
    <li> made my daughter&#x27;s hair soft but i didn&#x27;t notice any help in detangling her fine, straight hair after a bath.</li>
    <li> Girls and ponies both like it.</li>
    <li> Life saver For long thin curly baby hair that will knot over night!!! Just be careful when spraying over tile or linoleum. It makes a invisible coated surface that is slick as ice. If I had a disc to ride down a snowy hill this would work, probably like the scene on the Griswald family Christmas.</li>
    <li> Best product I&#x27;ve found for detangling my long hair.  Unfortunately, Amazon now thinks I own/am a horse and sends copious amounts of horse related product suggestions. Its a small price to pay to be able to get a brush through my hair without tearing it apart.</li>
    <li> Good stuff!!  Yeah, a little pricey but worth it.</li>
    <li> Wow! I can&#x27;t believe i&#x27;m just now trying this out.  This thing is ridiculously awesome for detangling hair so quickly and smoothly!  I&#x27;m impressed and my hair can get tangled quickly since i have mixed hair type.</li>
    <li> Works really well and definitely detangles hair.</li>
    <li> This works great on my daughter&#x27;s thick, wavy hair without being greasy or weighing her hair down. It&#x27;s also odorless.</li>
    <li> Worked great for getting the matted areas loose after I took my braids down before washing. Made my natural hair easy to handle without being painful.</li>
    <li> This is the best detangler I have I found fir my daughter&#x27;s natural hair. I use it with Cantu products and it is a miracle. Still some kinks but not like before when I did not have this detangler!</li>
    <li> A friend of mine suggested buying this stuff to de-tangle wigs and it is FANTASTIC! I tried using it on myself as well and don&#x27;t have any of the problems that come with having fine wet hair that just sticks together!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: If you have smooth floors where you spray this it will make them really slippery when wearing socks. I have had some close calls sometimes!!</li>
    <li> My hair and I have a complicated relationship. It hates me, I usually like it, a lot of products don&#x27;t agree with it and it takes its wrath out on me and those around me. I use the Mane n Tail shampoo and conditioner, as well as the deep moisturizing conditioner. Both of those conditioners have coconut oil in them, which while it makes the hair really soft and shiny, it does make getting a comb or brush through my hair difficult when the hair is damp. Meaning, I HAVE TO use some type of detangler to brush it out. And I know you shouldn&#x27;t comb or brush wet hair since that just damages it, but if I don&#x27;t, it gets so snarled that I have to douse it in detangler to get a comb to go through it and not just get stuck too. (Believe me, it&#x27;s happened. Comb, brush, hands, snake, my daughter, my husband, necklaces, all of it has been tangled in my mane before. I told you, it hates me.) Well, this stuff does the trick, and it smells like the other Mane n Tail products so you don&#x27;t have to worry about them clashing. If you don&#x27;t use their other products, the scent of this is a nice, clean smell that is neither masculine nor feminine, so it works on anybody. A few sprays are enough to lubricate the hair so my brush glides through with minimal force, so little to no pain. I&#x27;m very glad I bought the two pack, I don&#x27;t go through that much spray but they don&#x27;t sell this near me and I like to have extra for when I run out. A very good product that doesn&#x27;t weigh down hair or make it greasy, definitely worth ordering.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. My husband uses this on his long beard and I use it on my long hair. We both love it. I can use it with wet or dry hair and it makes my hair smooth in an instant. It really does help the split ends from looking so bad and afterwards my hair feels very soft. I even tried it on my friend&#x27;s 5 yr old daughter who literally screams every time her hair is brushed and it takes about 30 minutes to brush it. When I sprayed it on her and brushed it she had no tears, it took a whole 2 minutes to brush through and she was all smiles. It&#x27;s kind of a miracle worker :)</li>
    <li> Cannot live without this product, ideal for children with long hair!</li>
    <li> I used this when I was a kid and now I ordered it for my daughter. Use this with &amp;#34;The Wet Brush&amp;#34; I just purchased and there will be no more tangles...crying fits... My two year old will actually let me brush her hair out now. BEST STUFF EVER</li>
    <li> I relax my hair and like to use a leave in conditioner regularly. This product was awesome. It detangled my hair without leaving a sticky film behind. This product smells like freshly washed hair. The fragrance is light and fresh, not over powering. I will be stock piling this stuff! Will order again!</li>
    <li> One bottle arrived leaking, leaving me with about a 1/2 bottle left.  The other bottle was sealed properly.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter she absolutely loves it, according to her is the best detangler she ever used.</li>
    <li> I wear my hair up in a bun at work, it&#x27;s long and curly and it tangles so easily causing awful knots. I tried so many products that would barely help until I got an awful knot the size of a baseball that I thought I&#x27;d never get out. I bought mane n tail detangler and a few other products and this was the only one that worked. Now I use it every day in my hair and I havent had a knot since.</li>
    <li> SO CONVIENT TO HAVE THIS ITEM DELIVERED RIGHT TO YOUR DOOR wouldn&#x27;t be without this my daughter calls it horse spray it really works believe me we have tats.</li>
    <li> Love this! The two bottles have lasted me forever, and I spray it on generously daily after I shower. I&#x27;ll definitely rebuy them when these run out, though I&#x27;m assuming I&#x27;ll be able to use it for another year or so before that happens.</li>
    <li> I brought this for my daughter who has 4c natural hair, this is what she had to say about this product, &amp;#34;I have really thick hair and I always dread the day I have to detangle it. I&#x27;ve tried Kinky Curly Knot Today leave-in conditioner, As I Am leave-in conditioner, and coconut oil as detangling solution and none of them made it any easier for me. However the Mane &#x27;n Tail Detangler is a miracle to my tangled hair! When I used the detangler, it really helped my wide-tooth comb glide so much easier through my hair, it really made detangling so much easier, and it smells good too.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> My daughters have thick hair with difficult tangles. This product is s lifesaver!</li>
    <li> Great product. Excellent for detangling naturally coily or kinky hair.</li>
    <li> I have very fine.hair that is frosted and almost impossible to comb out when wet, even with a Wet Brush.  But all the detanglers I&#x27;ve tried make my hair flat.  Not so with this product!  It makes my hair soft and shiny, and.I only have to use 3-5 spritz.  Believe the positive reviews on this.  It is great AND a good buy!</li>
    <li> Biewers are just adorable and loving dogs; however, unless one is lucky (or not) to get one with silky hair instead of cottony hair, a tangled mess can ensue unless you comb and brush every day.  We first tried combing and brushing without help.  Then we took her to the groomer (I think goomer would be better but....) and found the groomer had little patience with a dog that had more tangles and webs than a spider&#x27;s next.  The only way the groomer could effect a haircut was to shave her and she looked like a shaved dog; not a professionally groomed dog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not to be outdone by a simple problem, we thought, so we bought some Mane &#x27;n Tail Detangler and had a much better outlook on keeping our dog groomed.  When either one of us suggests a combing or brushing, she is all perky and ready for a comb.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe on our next trip to a groomer, we will take the Mane &#x27;n Tail with us in case help is needed.</li>
    <li> I am biracial and have thin, breakable, relaxed/curly  hair. So, yeah. It&#x27;s not easy to find products that work for me. This detangler is good. It&#x27;s not emollient or creamy, but a watery, liquid spray (hence, the spray bottle).  I spray it on my hair after shamppoing and conditioning (with V05 moisture milk conditioner which is really cheap and good at detangling in the shower). I go section by section in my towel-dried hair and let the mane &#x27;n tail sit for a minute or two. Then, I comb through gently, and it works well. I&#x27;ve noticed a lot less breakage when I comb. I&#x27;ll be buying this again. Oh, and this product is not a leave-in conditioner. It&#x27;s just a detangler. Due to my dry hair, I still need extra moisture (maybe almond oil or something) in my hair after I use this to detangle it.</li>
    <li> Got all the knots out with a minimum of ouch.  Works for me.</li>
    <li> Works well on my wife&#x27;s long wet hair.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this life saving product!!! My hair is super thick and curly and without this stuff I would be lost! It&#x27;s like magic how it detangles hair, and I&#x27;ve been using it for over 10 years. I highly recommend purchasing the pack of 2 since it qualifies for Prime shipping!</li>
    <li> main n tail is the one detangler that actually works for me.  I am an adult with straight hair a few inches past my shoulders that tangles and snarls constantly.  I have a lot of fine straight hair that knots up easily.  This product makes it possible to keep my hair in something other than a very short hair style. Similar products are aimed at children, have strong odors, and generally work poorly.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because a reviewer stated that this was a miracle potion that helped to prevent him/her from cutting their locks and instead just combing their hair back to its natural state. Well, I said hey I dont have locks, my hair is in a texturized state, this product should more than do the trick. Uh--NO. My hair is more tangled than before I spray this onto my Super thick, BSL, AFRICAN AMERICAN hair, I&#x27;m talking spider web crocheted tangles.  Horrible. Just simple water and post instant conditioner left my hair more detangled than the &amp;#34;after&amp;#34; of this Con.  I have given this BS enough opportunities( initially purchased two bottles) to live up to the paid advertised hype masquerading as customer reviews. No more.  Down the drain it goes along with my money.</li>
    <li> I have used this product on my hair on four separate occasions and I did not notice any improvement untangling my hair. After reading other reviews about how great this product is I was hopeful it would work for my hair. Now I&#x27;m stuck with two bottles. The one thing I notice is that it makes floor tile very slippery.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! My 4yr old has super curly hair and this is great in the mornings.</li>
    <li> really helps on the Westie</li>
</ol>
