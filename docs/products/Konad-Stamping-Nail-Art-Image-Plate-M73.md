    <li> Does not work at all!!! Polish drys on the plate and will not transfer to the stamper. Would not recommend it at all!!!</li>
    <li> This plate is awesome.  The quality is very good.  The images on this plate look so adorable, especially the piano w/notes., and the images print up very nicely.  A must have for the collection.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> this takes more practice but eventually u&#x27;ll get it i suggest 2 start off with the squared shape one for me that was the easiest. music one was harder to put on but like i said practice and ur nails will thank u</li>
    <li> I love this nail art stamp image plate. Of course Konad puts the best of nail art stamping image products out there on the market. Always a clean and consistent stamping image</li>
    <li> The plate wasnt scratched and works great with the double sided stamper. The music notes turn out better than I expected.</li>
    <li> Great condition - gorgeous designs.</li>
    <li> The plate came wrapped and protected properly. Upon using the plate with a regular polish it stamped very nicely, dark (I used black polish) with complete clarity. I have decided to order more plates as a result. Hope that helps. Using acetone to remove the polish leaves streaks on the plate. Regular polish does not neither will damage the plate it&#x27;s just my pet peeve.&lt;br /&gt;Parris</li>
    <li> Love it. Very fast shipping</li>
    <li> Love love love love love it.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars since it arrived quickly and was the product stated...I just can&#x27;t get it to work with the polish I have</li>
    <li> I recieved different product. Not very happy about that...</li>
    <li> This stamping plate arrived on time. It is great quality. I have plates from Salon Effects and Bundle Monster, but the images are too large for my nails.

    <li> I probably should have ordered a set of Konad plates, but I honestly thought I would only order one or two and be done. It&#x27;s addictive!
