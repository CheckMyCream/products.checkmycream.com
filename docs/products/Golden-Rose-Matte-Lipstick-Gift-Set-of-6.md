      <li>These are ok for the price.</li>
      <li>Love the colors and for the price you cannot beat it.  </li>
      <li>mostly because I was giving them as a gift.</li>
      <li>Definitely one of the best matte lipstick sets ever.</li>

      <li>i liked SET1 so much...</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly.</li>
      <li>The other colors are so beautiful too.</li>
      <li>Amazing lipstick, long stay , nice colors , worth the price, going to buy another pair.</li>
      <li>That alone would make them special.</li>
      <li>Good value, use everyday and am pleased.</li>
      <li>Golden Rose cosmetics are made in Turkey and generally available only in Europe.</li>
      <li>But finding matte lipstick is very hard, in my experience, and finding a range of shades which happens to be perfect for me is extraordinary.</li>
      <li>Nice color, but a very dry lipstick.</li>
      <li>But are drying compared to other matte lip products I own.</li>
      <li>but this is very comparable.</li>
      <li>i really like these lipsticks.</li>
      <li>I am a matte lipstick kind of girl and ordered set no.2 within a few minutes of receiving no.1.</li>
      <li>I really love these lispstick, mainly the red, because this color is so vivid and mantein in the lips almost during all day.</li>
      <li>Nice matte shades that last a long time.</li>
      <li>They apply very smoothly on the lips &amp; I have already ordered the other color set!</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t vouch for the product itself, but the tubes looked cheap and they were all just loose...</li>
      <li>The lipsticks are highly pigmented and not too drying to the lips.</li>
      <li>The colors are different shades of pink which I love.  </li>
      <li>I was so surprised!</li>
      <li>Obviously they are matte &amp; are slightly drying, but not horrible.</li>
      <li>I was skeptical at first but these glide on smoothly, stay on for a reasonable amount of time, and have a lot of pigment.</li>

<li> Right when I opened it, the stick on the inside was detached and stuck to the cap -- indicative of poor quality/manufacturing.</li>
<li> i bought SET2 a few days later.</li>
<li> so I get the weird line of old lipstick build up around the inner parts of my lips</li>
<li> And at less than five dollars apiece?</li>
<li> Like all matte lip wear, it may be drying, but that&#x27;s nothing a little dose of chapstick before application can&#x27;t fix.</li>
<li> Disappointing.</li>
<li> you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
<li> The lipsticks  came in smushed tho :(</li>

    <li> Beautiful colors!! Love!!</li>
    <li> You sint 3 colors redðŸ˜£</li>
    <li> Disappointing. Right when I opened it, the stick on the inside was detached and stuck to the cap -- indicative of poor quality/manufacturing. Will be returning.</li>
    <li> i really like these lipsticks. the price is great and the color is very pigmented and pretty. I usually only wear matte lipsticks by mac. but this is very comparable. i liked SET1 so much... i bought SET2 a few days later. try it. you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> this turn out to be amazing, the colors are beautiful, and the texture is matte but creamy at the same time</li>
    <li> Golden Rose cosmetics are made in Turkey and generally available only in Europe. That alone would make them special. But finding matte lipstick is very hard, in my experience, and finding a range of shades which happens to be perfect for me is extraordinary. And at less than five dollars apiece? That qualifies as phenomenal! Color me delighted!</li>
    <li> These are ok for the price. But are drying compared to other matte lip products I own. Also, it can go on patchy as well, so that is def something to have in mind.</li>
    <li> The colors are beautiful! And they definitely last all day.</li>
    <li> Good value, use everyday and am pleased.</li>
    <li> Amazing lipstick, long stay , nice colors , worth the price, going to buy another pair.</li>
    <li> Easy to put on. The lipsticks  came in smushed tho :(</li>

    <li> Amazing - beautifully packaged and just pretty colors overall.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift and thought, because of the price, it would be a nice set.  I can&#x27;t vouch for the product itself, but the tubes looked cheap and they were all just loose...not in a boxed set as I was expecting.  I tried packing them to look nice in a box that I had, but it was still disappointing...mostly because I was giving them as a gift.</li>
    <li> Nice color, but a very dry lipstick. Doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly.</li>
    <li> Matte 4sure...love the colors</li>
    <li> I was so surprised! The lipsticks are highly pigmented and not too drying to the lips. I tend to talk a lot so I get the weird line of old lipstick build up around the inner parts of my lips &amp; I didn&#x27;t get that with these. Obviously they are matte &amp; are slightly drying, but not horrible. They do last for a couple of hours (4-6 depending if you eat or drink). They apply very smoothly on the lips &amp; I have already ordered the other color set! It&#x27;s a great price and buy for the color pay off, number of lipsticks, and color variety.</li>
    <li> I really love these lispstick, mainly the red, because this color is so vivid and mantein in the lips almost during all day. The other colors are so beautiful too.</li>
    <li> the colors are awesome</li>
    <li> Just great, looks so normal!!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my daughter and she loves it! Nice matte shades that last a long time.</li>
    <li> Absolutely beautiful lipsticks. Like all matte lip wear, it may be drying, but that&#x27;s nothing a little dose of chapstick before application can&#x27;t fix. Glides on easy, amazing wear, doesn&#x27;t settle into fine lines. Incredible, lovely lipsticks. And what a bargain!</li>
    <li> Love the colors and for the price you cannot beat it.  I like the matte texture which reminds me of the MAC matte lipsticks.  The colors are different shades of pink which I love.  So affordable!!!</li>
