      <li>This face wash works great.</li>
      <li>Honestly, that&#x27;s a bit \\&quot;girly\\&quot; LOL.</li>
      <li>It does a good job of cleaning your face.</li>
      <li>This is nice stuff.</li>
      <li>Excellent product and very eye pleasing.</li>
      <li>It also has a nice smell.</li>
      <li>It smells and feels nice, and you can feel the &amp;#34;chilled&amp;#34; sensation in your skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have found that I most enjoy using this product during my morning shower as it leaves my skin tingling and is a very refreshing way to wake up before you go about your day.</li>
      <li>it all over me....smells sexy like a man.  </li>
      <li>Hubby loves this face wash, I guess it makes him feel manly :) he loves the cooling sensation.</li>
      <li>I am pleased and it does what it is supposed to do.</li>
      <li>Women are typically more conservative with the use of their product and not wasteful.</li>
      <li>I love this product and the majority of Axe products as a matter of fact.</li>
      <li>It washes clean and lathers up nicely.</li>
      <li>, I felt that my skin was very clean afterwards.</li>
      <li>My face is very clean after using the chilled face wash and has a slite menthol feeling but not over powering at all.</li>
      <li>After rinsing you&#x27;ll not only get a great cooling sensation but you&#x27;ll smell nice as well.  </li>
      <li>It smells really nice and was worth it for the price.</li>
      <li>The smell is fresh and all there new face products smell very good.</li>
      <li>Axe new line is great the ingredients in their new face products are surpringly good like cucumber, grape seed, and jojoba.</li>
      <li>they were fine.  </li>
      <li>It feels good and that&#x27;s the most I can say about it in a positive manner, it certainly doesn&#x27;t clean my face.</li>
      <li>Axe Cooling Face Wash facial scrub is a great product for us guys.</li>
      <li>However, at over six dollars for a 5 once tube, I would not consider this a good value because there are many other face and body washes for men from known brands available for significantly less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It leaves my face feeling clean.</li>
      <li>The final thing that I like about this product is that I find a lot of AXE brand colognes and such to be incredibly overpowering but this face wash has a pleasant and much milder scent that does not leave others who are in the room with you gasping for breath.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nothing special.</li>
      <li>Once I clean my face, it is fresh and smooth for hours.</li>
      <li>The cost is reasonable and after feeling is clean and refreshing.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t &#x27;cool&#x27; anything.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
      <li>Face is left moisturized, clean, and has a nice cooling effect.</li>
      <li>It wasnt worth the money to me.</li>
      <li>It does provide a slight cooling sensation and has a fresh pleasant scent.</li>
      <li>The cooling effect left a tingling feeling on my skin that felt refreshing.</li>
      <li>It is mild and gives a nice \\&quot;cooling\\&quot; sensation without it being too harsh.</li>
      <li>If your looking for a product to dry out your face and cause more acne, well you have found the correct product.</li>
      <li>This is an upgrade to my current face wash and the fragrances wasn&#x27;t too strong either.</li>
      <li>This is a good facial cleanser that leaves your face feeling like you just wiped it with a nice menthol or very subtle witch hazel.</li>
      <li>This face wash had a lot of foam and large bubbles</li>
      <li>Smells good and cleans well, but will dry out your skin if left on for an extended amount of time (over 2 minutes).</li>
      <li>It is no great skin product, but it feels cooling to them (great after a day in the sun).</li>
      <li>You can really feel this working.</li>
      <li>Maybe the other ones in the line would suit my needs more, but for this in particular, it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>Men on the other hand, are more prone to blast out a big gob of this stuff in our hands and accidentally wash our whole body with it first.</li>
      <li>Axe products also all have a very nice invigorating scent that is often too musty, too generic or too obvious in other men&#x27;s line</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>This specific face wash has a mint ingredient that produces fresh mint sent and cooling sensations on my face.</li>
      <li>I will keep bying there new line of face products.</li>
      <li>I still have it, I only use it sparingly now, since it&#x27;s simpler to just clean my face with a bar of Dove, which has the same effect</li>
      <li>Save your hard earned money for a better product.</li>
      <li>This product exploded out of the soft gel plastic packaging.  </li>
      <li>As a bonus, my skin feels soft and hydrated.  </li>
      <li>It smells like old man.&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
      <li>I am really digging Axe&#x27;s products and this facial wash is no exception.  </li>
      <li>This product not only was not \\&quot;cooling\\&quot; like I thought it would be, but it dried out my face and seemed to cause more acne.</li>
      <li>All you have to do is rinse your face, apply face wash, massage in gently and rinse (be careful not to get the soap in your eyes).  </li>
      <li>Not rough on your face like body wash is.</li>
      <li>It kept my face slightly cleaner, but didn&#x27;t do much beyond that.</li>

    <li> If your looking for a product to dry out your face and cause more acne, well you have found the correct product. This product not only was not \\&quot;cooling\\&quot; like I thought it would be, but it dried out my face and seemed to cause more acne. Save your hard earned money for a better product.</li>
    <li> Not rough on your face like body wash is. Face is left moisturized, clean, and has a nice cooling effect. Bottle is a bit pricey, but works well for the price!</li>
    <li> I have two teen boys who have been using this. It is no great skin product, but it feels cooling to them (great after a day in the sun). It has not been drying to their skin, nor does it make them greasy or shiny. I will probably keep buying it for them as long as they keep using it.</li>
    <li> Smells good and cleans well, but will dry out your skin if left on for an extended amount of time (over 2 minutes).</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nothing special. If you&#x27;re just looking for a simple face cleaner without anything extra, then this is for you. I was mislead into thinking that this had cleansing beads in it but it does not. It&#x27;s just gel. It smells really nice and was worth it for the price.</li>
    <li> I like the sent. It leaves my face feeling clean.</li>
    <li> Very nice product, prompt delivery!</li>
    <li> 1) It doesn&#x27;t &#x27;cool&#x27; anything.&lt;br /&gt;2) It smells like old man.&lt;br /&gt;3) It leaves a slimy residue, like shave gel.&lt;br /&gt;4) I&#x27;ll stick with Neutrogena.</li>
    <li> I accidentally ordered this instead of the Oil Control one. But that is 100% my fault. Not holding that against Axe at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this a few times, and it cleans very well. Once I clean my face, it is fresh and smooth for hours. It smells and feels nice, and you can feel the &amp;#34;chilled&amp;#34; sensation in your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But why 4 stars?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, it did very little to clear up any blemishes on my face. It kept my face slightly cleaner, but didn&#x27;t do much beyond that. It wasnt worth the money to me. Maybe the other ones in the line would suit my needs more, but for this in particular, it didn&#x27;t work. I still have it, I only use it sparingly now, since it&#x27;s simpler to just clean my face with a bar of Dove, which has the same effect it seems.</li>
    <li> I love this product and the majority of Axe products as a matter of fact. This specific face wash has a mint ingredient that produces fresh mint sent and cooling sensations on my face. It doesn&#x27;t try my skin either (Cetaphil face wash actually dries it). The cost is reasonable and after feeling is clean and refreshing. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> It feels good and that&#x27;s the most I can say about it in a positive manner, it certainly doesn&#x27;t clean my face.</li>

    <li> I like this face wash.  It does provide a slight cooling sensation and has a fresh pleasant scent. However, at over six dollars for a 5 once tube, I would not consider this a good value because there are many other face and body washes for men from known brands available for significantly less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, the ingredients list Sodium Laureth Sulphate as #2, so if this is a chemical you&#x27;ve been trying to avoid, you should consider something else.</li>
    <li> Axe Cooling Face Wash facial scrub is a great product for us guys. All you have to do is rinse your face, apply face wash, massage in gently and rinse (be careful not to get the soap in your eyes).  After rinsing you&#x27;ll not only get a great cooling sensation but you&#x27;ll smell nice as well.  You will have to fend off the ladies at work when you use it.  I am really digging Axe&#x27;s products and this facial wash is no exception.  If you want a long lasting cooling facial wash then you&#x27;ll definitely need to get a tube of Axe Cooling Face Wash today.</li>
    <li> This product exploded out of the soft gel plastic packaging.  I think something in the cooling aspect did not like Florida heat even though mailman left it in the 72 degree day shade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got it all over me....smells sexy like a man.  My husband did try it...but could only use once with residue in bottom of hard plastic cylinder.  The packging was not cracked or broken...the product just oozed out in several places....the bottom seam and the cap was open.  Received other items from Axe...they were fine.  Its the cooling agent.  Husband loves this.  Will buy in store.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and very eye pleasing. Axe new line is great the ingredients in their new face products are surpringly good like cucumber, grape seed, and jojoba. My face is very clean after using the chilled face wash and has a slite menthol feeling but not over powering at all. The smell is fresh and all there new face products smell very good. Also I have the shield shave gel and is very pleased excellent ingredents and great shave gel. I will keep bying there new line of face products.</li>
    <li> Hubby loves this face wash, I guess it makes him feel manly :) he loves the cooling sensation.</li>
    <li> This face wash works great. It does a good job of cleaning your face. You can really feel this working. It also has a nice smell. I will definetly use this product again. It is moderately priced for face washes. So not the most expensive but not the cheapest either.</li>
    <li> This is nice stuff. It is mild and gives a nice \\&quot;cooling\\&quot; sensation without it being too harsh. It washes clean and lathers up nicely. I am pleased and it does what it is supposed to do. Not much else to say about face wash ...</li>
    <li> This is a good facial cleanser that leaves your face feeling like you just wiped it with a nice menthol or very subtle witch hazel. There is no witch hazel in this, but it leaves the feeling that is somewhere in between the two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These Axe products also all have a very nice invigorating scent that is often too musty, too generic or too obvious in other men&#x27;s line products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve since restocked this product but only wished that it came in a larger size, like a 10 or 12 ounce container. 5 ounces? Honestly, that&#x27;s a bit \\&quot;girly\\&quot; LOL. Women are typically more conservative with the use of their product and not wasteful. Men on the other hand, are more prone to blast out a big gob of this stuff in our hands and accidentally wash our whole body with it first. This stuff needs to upsized.</li>
    <li> AXE Chilled promises to make your skin look and feel irresistible  -- and I must say that it does a good job!  I have found that I most enjoy using this product during my morning shower as it leaves my skin tingling and is a very refreshing way to wake up before you go about your day. As a bonus, my skin feels soft and hydrated.  The final thing that I like about this product is that I find a lot of AXE brand colognes and such to be incredibly overpowering but this face wash has a pleasant and much milder scent that does not leave others who are in the room with you gasping for breath.</li>
