      <li>I guess and covered the gray great.</li>
      <li>Great.  </li>
      <li>Lol.</li>
      <li>, I had to spread my joy.</li>
      <li>Works great for me.  </li>
      <li>But it just does not cover my gray as good as the liquid.</li>
      <li>It gave my hair beautiful, healthy looking, wavy body from the o mousse</li>
      <li>And she is very happy with this fancy full product</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>So glad I did!</li>
      <li>I just got it today and used it for the first time and am very happy with the results.</li>
      <li>Good product could have been packaged better.</li>
      <li>It covers fairly well but nothing extraordinary.</li>
      <li>I am so pleased I tried this product.</li>
      <li>Also helps to make my hair more manageable and gives it more body.  </li>
      <li>Will stay with this for sure,</li>
      <li>and I like the texture of my hair better with it, so</li>
      <li>This is a great product without going to a professional to color your hair.</li>
      <li>This product is amazing, I was not aware there is a Mousse Roux Fanci-full, happy</li>
      <li>But mine fine, slippery hair does NOT move one inch.</li>
      <li>I might try their liquid version after I check out more reviews although most of the reviews I&#x27;ve read so far mentioned that thgis Mousse version covered gray better</li>
      <li>I was excited to try the foam product as the liquid is so runny but the color doesn&#x27;t saturate.&lt;br /&gt;Hope</li>
      <li>I have used product for two years it works great and adds just the right amount of color to offset the grey in my hair</li>
      <li>Vendor service first rate delivered as promised.</li>
      <li>This is perfect, easy to apply and does not dry out my hair or fade to some weird color.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only used it once so far and love it!</li>
      <li>It is fair to say it does work, but I find it to be very messy and it makes my hair feel sticky.</li>
      <li>Was in a large box which allowed it to roll around, cap came off and it leaked.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t write reviews hardly ever but felt so good about this product</li>
      <li>It does color very temporary - until you wash your hair again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>No smell, no scalp irritation and my hair looks very well groomed.</li>
      <li>This Mousse really helps me to stretch out my hair coloring</li>
      <li>I like this mousse because it&#x27;s thicker than the Roux Fanci Full liquid and last longer on my hair.</li>
      <li>Grey hairs are more resistant to color absorption than regular hair, especially with a temporary color.</li>
      <li>Had bought Chocolate Kiss before, but this color brown is lighter and blends in so well with my natural color.  </li>
      <li>Looks totally natural too.</li>
      <li>but it did not cover my natural gray/silver even though I gobbed it on.</li>
      <li>I gave it a try, much better than the regular liquid form of the rinse which can be a bit messy.  </li>
      <li>At first I was glad, since it was less messy than the liquid.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a 55 year old male with 50% gray hair - 50% brown.</li>

<li> It has an odd feel, almost sticky.</li>
<li> only thing I&#x27;m not thrilled with is, makes your hair feel stiff to touch,&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t</li>
<li> Just needed a little darker shade and some of the gray covered.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I am so pleased I tried this product. I do not want to dye my hair, even a temporary dye, because it always ends up red-orange. Just needed a little darker shade and some of the gray covered. This is perfect, easy to apply and does not dry out my hair or fade to some weird color. Looks totally natural too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once so far and love it! I am 55 and have maybe 5 percent gray but dreaded starting the dying process so have been putting it off. I saw this on Amazon and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. So glad I did! I put it on lightly as I have very thick hair and was a little nervous. It gave my hair beautiful, healthy looking, wavy body from the o mousse I guess and covered the gray great. I don&#x27;t write reviews hardly ever but felt so good about this product, I had to spread my joy. Lol. Let&#x27;s hope it continues with subsequent uses.</li>
    <li> This is a great product without going to a professional to color your hair.</li>
    <li> This Mousse really helps me to stretch out my hair coloring so I don&#x27;t have to do it as often.</li>
    <li> but it did not cover my natural gray/silver even though I gobbed it on. I had a cosmetology license, so I understand why it didn&#x27;t. Grey hairs are more resistant to color absorption than regular hair, especially with a temporary color. I think it made my brown hair look a little richer in color and I like the texture of my hair better with it, so I will probably buy it again.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed that the color name on the can was not the color of the product that came out of the can!  I have used this color before, so I know what it should be.  Instead of the brown that I ordered, SILVER was what was inside!</li>
    <li> my husband loves the color that it puts in his hair</li>
    <li> I have used product for two years it works great and adds just the right amount of color to offset the grey in my hair</li>
    <li> I was hoping to use this during the 2 weeks before my next color to cover the grey. It is fair to say it does work, but I find it to be very messy and it makes my hair feel sticky. It covers fairly well but nothing extraordinary. In my opinion, it is not worth it for the mess and for how it makes your hair feel.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try the foam product as the liquid is so runny but the color doesn&#x27;t saturate.&lt;br /&gt;Hope they try making a creamy product next.</li>
    <li> It does color very temporary - until you wash your hair again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I&#x27;m not thrilled with is, makes your hair feel stiff to touch,&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t look bad, just not shiney, so if you are use to your hair having&lt;br /&gt;a shine, you will need to use a spray shine after using this&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like they have it in  a lot of colors</li>
    <li> Been  using this product for years as a :touch up..</li>
    <li> Good product could have been packaged better. Was in a large box which allowed it to roll around, cap came off and it leaked.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that I bought the mousse instead of the liquid. At first I was glad, since it was less messy than the liquid. But it just does not cover my gray as good as the liquid. I&#x27;m going back to the liquid.</li>
    <li> Great.  It covers the gray and keeps me from a big dye job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Mina Perry</li>
    <li> Not sure it colors my hair much, but it hella packs a punch in the mousse department. It is so sticky it is kinda like glue. But mine fine, slippery hair does NOT move one inch. Finally after all these years, something finally holds my hair in place.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing, I was not aware there is a Mousse Roux Fanci-full, happy I gave it a try, much better than the regular liquid form of the rinse which can be a bit messy.  Will stay with this for sure, hope it&#x27;s not a &amp;#34;discontinued&amp;#34; item.  Vendor service first rate delivered as promised.</li>
    <li> Had bought Chocolate Kiss before, but this color brown is lighter and blends in so well with my natural color.  The mousse is easier to handle than the liquid version.  Also helps to make my hair more manageable and gives it more body.  Love it!</li>
    <li> This Mouse formula is easier to use than the liquid, but its still not for me. It has an odd feel, almost sticky. It will do in a pinch if you want to hide a few gray hairs for a few hours.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my mom.  She usually use it. And she is very happy with this fancy full product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 55 year old male with 50% gray hair - 50% brown. I stopped using the over the counter products like Just For Men because they really irritated my scalp and smelled disgusting. Ordered this figuring that I&#x27;d be only throwing away $11 if it didn&#x27;t work. Well, I have to say, I just got it today and used it for the first time and am very happy with the results. My hair is noticeably darker, but not to the point where I look like I had a dye job. No smell, no scalp irritation and my hair looks very well groomed. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Works great for me.  I do not like the harsh dyes and this is so great, I can color plus gives me a styling ingredient also . All in one</li>
    <li> It did not blend my gray and it made my hair very stiff, will never purchase this again...I might try their liquid version after I check out more reviews although most of the reviews I&#x27;ve read so far mentioned that thgis Mousse version covered gray better so i am hesitant to try the liquid version.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband because he really wanted to see if he would look younger with the darker hair, but it just looked too artificial for his complexion.  He went back to using Grecian Formula.</li>
    <li> I like this mousse because it&#x27;s thicker than the Roux Fanci Full liquid and last longer on my hair.</li>
