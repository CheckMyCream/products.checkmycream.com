<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love these plates! I was weary to choose plates because I&#x27;ve read that many plates are not engraved deep enough to get a good design. These plates are excellent and I tried a few designs and they&#x27;re easy to pick up. I would definitely suggest this set of nail stamping plates, especially for the great price. Just to note, these plates do not come with a stamper or instructions, so you will have to buy a stamper separately. I suggest reading up on techniques and tips before stamping.</li>
    <li> Very good stamping plates, especially for the price. I definitely suggest getting an organizer for the plates to keep them separate so that they don&#x27;t scratch each other. As long as you have an excellent stamper, transferring the images from the plates should not be difficult. And I didn&#x27;t experience any doubles, like other reviewers have complained about, so they stepped their game up.</li>
    <li> Product did not come with instructions.  I was just buying a bunch of nail stuff.  Was tough to work with.</li>
    <li> I just got these a fee days ago. There&#x27;s so many designs to chose from I can&#x27;t wait to start using using them !</li>
    <li> I was excited to receive my plates in the mail. I received them on time, so that made me happy. However, when I was looking through them I noticed that one of the plates was severely damaged. It has a deep gash going right through half of the plate. There is no way around it and I cannot use two of the designs on this particular plate. It&#x27;s a shame because it happened to be one of the plates I was looking forward to -.- go figure. I then realized that many of them were already scuffed up despite the blue plastic guards...</li>
    <li> For the price it isn&#x27;t terrible. some of the plates work great, but some of them don&#x27;t work at all. Overall, i&#x27;m glad i bought it so i have some that work but i wouldn&#x27;t buy from this company again. They need to slightly deepen the engraving on the plates</li>
    <li> This set is definitely better then Shany sets I have purchased before.  So far every plate I have used did really well.  Thank you Shany for improving your design!</li>
    <li> Totally disappointed. I ordered these plates especially for hello kitty images in plates 201 and 210, but to the surprise I received a different image plates with that nos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend this unless shany replaces me with those 2 plates.(which I don&#x27;t think so).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the company has changed the plates why are those hello kitty still in the picture shown.</li>
    <li> I bought it reading the reviews and most of the reviews were good. It came on time and had all the components, well packaged. I was so excited until I used the product. My stamp wouldn&#x27;t pick the image, and when it did the image didn&#x27;t come completely, and I&#x27;m not sure if its the stamper&#x27;s fault or the plates are bad, but either way my images didn&#x27;t come onto my nails. I used a different stamper, and that too doesn&#x27;t pick up the images, but it works for my other plates, SO I CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE SHANY PLATES DON&#x27;T WORK AND ARE DEFECTIVE. Now I&#x27;m not happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this nail set and was truly disappointed. I had heard wonderful things (great image detail, sides don&#x27;t hurt your fingers, good packaging) but this was NOT my experience. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s due to packaging or shipping but out of the 25 nail plates in this set, three arrived scratched - and I mean truly scratched as if they had been previously used with a metal scraper. I knew they were not previously used because they came with the blue film that indicates a new item. That wasn&#x27;t even the worse part... EIGHT of the plates came TARNISHED. The images were black inside. Super, incredibly weird. I tried nail polish remover (with and without acetone) as well as rubbing alcohol. Nothing cleaned the images. I was told this would not affect the stamping of the images but come on! It&#x27;s a brand new product! I contacted Shany Costumer Service to let them know of the quality of their products and they \\&quot;apologized for the inconvenience\\&quot; and told me to contact Amazon for a refund/exchange. Which I of course am doing as I type this because I know at least Amazon will give me quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: stay away from SHANY! Go for Gals, Winstonia, Pueen or Konad for better quality product!</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed when I received this product. It is no exaggeration when I say half of the plates are defective. Im  not sure what happened to the images on the plates, but they were not etched correctly, the images are a dull grey to black on the defective plates. The other half of the plates work ok. I would have loved to provide a 3 star feedback - even with the defects but the 1 star is because plate sh210 (hello kitty) does not exist, it seems it has been replaced with kanji/Asian writing . The main reason I purchased this set was for hello kitty. I could have lived with the disappointment of the defects but I draw the line on an out rite lie. Now, with that being said - the ones that work, work ok. The images are a bit small compared to other brands, I use konad paints and I dont have a problem with image transfer. BUT TO MANY ARE DEFECTIVE.... Sorry Shany, but once bitten, twice shy.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I invested in this set. I&#x27;ve never done nail stamping before but tried this a a couple times and it works great! Great for slumber parties and quick nail art for going out. I have the Konad stamper and scraper. Only thing is not all nail polishes work well with stamping. So far, Sinful Colors and Sally Hansen polishes worked well for me. You have to be careful in applying a top coat over the dedign as well. Overall, awesome buy!</li>
    <li> This product is perfect for art diversity. There are many designs to choose from and a design for almost every occasion.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this purchase.  I used with my family, friends and with an old teacher.  All of them were happy.</li>
    <li> I enjoy this product. It makes it easy to create designs seamless for my clientele. The creativity is unlimited and effortless!!</li>
    <li> The discs are good. Some discs arrived no clean i dont know why but are so good for fix with its. thanks.</li>
    <li> I love this stamp set!</li>
    <li> Small but efficient.  The plates are about 2.5&amp;#34; in diameter and have designs that aren&#x27;t too elaborate.  Simple elegance in each design with everything from a Jewish star to Mickey Mouse to flowers, hearts and Chinese symbols (only wish I knew what they mean).  :)  Some stamp designs are difficult to get a clean, full impression but I think that is due to not having a polish that is thick enough?  I own NO Shany polishes, yet, but will most likely purchase a few just to see if the plates work better.</li>
    <li> Images transfer well.</li>
    <li> The plates aren&#x27;t deep enough to catch the design. I found it to be a headache for me.</li>
    <li> Ordered with Konad soluble ended stamper (which is awesome). I was originally inclined to buy this set because of the box. I wanted somewhere to store them instead of all 25 floating around with my polish. When it arrived the first time I opened the box it fell apart. The weight of all the metal plates way stronger than their awful glue job.  After a good tape and super glue job the box was finally functional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plates are a little bendy and sharp but isn&#x27;t an issue because they aren&#x27;t made to be man handled. And the blue film that comes on top of them that u must peel off is pretty hard to get off but it can be done!!!! (Eventually) lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After searching through tons of reviews I was concerned that the engravings wouldn&#x27;t be deep enough to transfer the image over. I haven&#x27;t tested all the&lt;br /&gt;Designs yet but so far I having noticed an issue. Some of the designs have a brownish tint to them but after testing those it had no  impact on the design transfer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-1 star just for the packaging, not the product.</li>
    <li> I had looked around for a while to find a nice set of inexpensive plates just to see if it was something I&#x27;d enjoy.  These plates came quickly and well packaged.  Some of the plates had minor scratches but not enough to interfere with any of the designs.  I&#x27;ve only tried a few designs so far, the etching seemed deep enough but a lot of the designs (even the full nail designs) are a bit small.  But for the price and the learning experience I&#x27;m more than happy with the amount of designs that are perfectly usable.</li>
    <li> I love all of the designs. Its my first time using a stamping set so i am having some difficulty but i still thought it was worth 5 stars.</li>
    <li> After taking 2 1/2 months to get to me, plates are scratched and they changed their 210 plate from images of Hello Kitty to what I think are Chinese characters.  Disappointing.</li>
    <li> These plates are horrible.  Do not waste your money.  The designs are cute, but are unusable.  I believe the designs are not cute deep enough and polish does not adhere to stamp. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Good product wonderful designs</li>
    <li> The engravings aren&#x27;t as &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34; as other stamps I&#x27;ve tried. So when I wipe it with an acetone cotton ball, there&#x27;s fibers left behind and I gotta clean them up. Otherwise it&#x27;s a pretty good product for it&#x27;s price!</li>
    <li> Works great. My teen loved them. Came pretty fast.</li>
    <li> Works well, but only with the special nail polish.  Without it these things are useless.  And the polish is a little on the expensive side.</li>
    <li> The plates are very unstable its much easier work with konads plates which are much harder not so yielding. Because of that nail polish doesnt distribute evently on the picture.</li>
    <li> Product works well and arrived on time. Removing the blue plastic from the plate is extremely difficult! The sides of the plates are very very sharp, by the time I was done unwrapping a few of the plates almost all of my fingers we cut :(. Overall the product works well but I will try a different brand for my next purchases.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t completely satisfied with the product.  Some of the images were not deep enough and other didn&#x27;t work well with any of the scrapers I used.</li>
    <li> Kind of small but really good</li>
    <li> I got these right away and couldn&#x27;t wait to use them. The scraper I bought didn&#x27;t work as well with these plates as I thought it would but I didn&#x27;t buy the special polish either. I&#x27;m going to be purchasing it soon to see if it makes a difference.</li>
    <li> Not the best plates out there. A few images will not work no matter what I do, or come out with imperfections. Semi - disappointed with them.</li>
    <li> ! Please read ! I was trying to peel off the plastic protecting the designs and my thumb slipped along the edge. Apparently it&#x27;s very sharp.  Now I have a deep(Ish) cut on my thumb.  Extremely painful.  Never had this problem with any other kits.</li>
    <li> I have tried a few of the terrific nail art stamp designs included in this very nice set.  My daughters (15 &amp; 17) are soooo excited about this new bonding tool for us &amp;#34;girls!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I am a beginner at nail art, and this is one of my first tools to build my kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will see posts like these from me many times.  I will put items to use as I gather them all together, from sellers I trust!</li>
    <li> Half of the plates were used and dirty</li>
    <li> everyday new look new shape and color, also lovely for little girls&lt;br /&gt;it was nicely covered i received it with non damages</li>
    <li> gift for granddaughter.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with these plates. They are a bit cheaply made compared to other brands. The metal scratches very easy with the razer scraper. So I suggest using a plastic one so you don&#x27;t destroy these.</li>
    <li> I received these templates feeling excited to try out my new stamper, and I&#x27;m pretty disappointed. One plate was rusty. Most of the full nail stamps are too small for a normal finger nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did contact SHANY about the rusty template. After sitting on hold for FOREVER while being told I was next in line, it ended up sending me to voicemail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I left a message, but didn&#x27;t have much hope of hearing back, based on other reviews. However, the rep called me back within 20 minutes, and they are shipping a replacement template. This fast resolution is the reason they got 4 stars. I understand that sometimes things happen, and the customer service and how it&#x27;s handled are what will keep me coming back to this company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received my replacement template on 2/10. Shipping took less that a week, so I would call that a win. No problems with the new template.</li>
    <li> Still learning how to master it&#x27;s a challenge to learn but I will keep trying they wasn&#x27;t packaged good at all just in a box no plastic but the plastic was in the box😳</li>
    <li> Great designs and ok etching. they are regular sized plates. The etching isnt the deepest it could be but gets the job done ok.</li>
    <li> Plates are nice, deep an in perfect condition!  Just wish stamping worked for me SMH.  Image&#x27;s aren&#x27;t showing up on top , so.....  Idk why</li>
    <li> Oh my so many choices.  Such a great price and super fast shipping,</li>
    <li> Quick delivery good product!!</li>
    <li> They have a lot of great designs in this set. It is fun to see what designs can use and come up with.</li>
    <li> IN LOVE WITH THIS  Fun and works really well</li>
    <li> The full images are very small, It will not cover entire (short) nail in one try</li>
    <li> I have only used these once so far. The quality isn&#x27;t as nice as the MASH plates as they seem a little more flimsy. But they still stamp nicely. The variety is good and I do plan on using the Xmas themed plates when it gets closer the holidays.</li>
    <li> The images on these plates are a good size. They are perfect for the average nails. The designs show through well when stamping.</li>
    <li> The figures are not deep enough to keep the Nail Polish, so it is impossible to get an image in the shield to transfer it to the nails.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this purchase because a lot of reviews said the Hello Kitty plate was swapped for a different one but the newest reviews were saying it was back in so I decide to do it. I shouldn&#x27;t have. First, it took 3 months to be delivered. Then when they did arrive, the Hello Kitty plate, that is still in the picture, was not in it. The full nail images are smaller than they look, so you will jive to try to line up the image to cover most nails. Several of the plates are pitted and the image is discolored, like its tarnished. Some of have what looks like polish under the protective film. And a few of the images are stamped so close together you can&#x27;t pick up only the image you want. There are a few images I like but it&#x27;s going to be such a hassle to use them because if size</li>
    <li> Love the options for creativity, great quality and packaging well.... but slow shipping but for the price guess you could wait for it to come.</li>
    <li> Came exactly as shown, great product, does what it says. Speedy delivery.</li>
    <li> The plates are great and transfer perfectly but I thought I was receiving 2 Hello Kitty plates (001 &amp; 010) but they were not in the set. Other than that, I absolutely love my shany plates and they&#x27;re a great addition to my growing collection! 😊😊😊</li>
    <li> some of the stamp plates are to shallow to pick up any type of print. most of them work though.</li>
    <li> These are really fun, loads of options. I&#x27;ll be back to order more. Thank you for speedy delivery. Actually fought not to try these but I&#x27;m happy that I did. Great fun</li>
    <li> Image plates are clear and stamp well. I literally bought this for 1 specific design. haha. Hope to get more use out of it in the future.</li>
    <li> Works Greate easy to install</li>
    <li> My husband ordered these plates for me for my birthday, which was over month ago, and he ordered them weeks in advance. I&#x27;d love to say what I thought of them, however I never received them. He is still in the process of trying to get his money back. From what I read in the reviews however, I would have been just as disappointed if I HAD actually gotten them. Do not waste your time with these!</li>
    <li> You have to be careful when you use it. the edge is sharp. however, i like these plate.&lt;br /&gt;many kinds of designs what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;good product</li>
    <li> The plates are horrible! I tried everything to get them to function properly.  I bought a mini stamp kit from Rite Aid,  and the plates in there work just fine  but these  are barely engraved to transfer the image.</li>
    <li> Good variety of designs, and they work well.</li>
    <li> If you like these things, this set has good selection.  I found them very hard to use and easy to scratch, though.</li>
    <li> First of all it took almost three months to receive this item.  No Hello Kitty plates.  Some of the plates are so thin it is unbelievable.  I haven&#x27;t even tried them with polish yet but my hopes aren&#x27;t too high since there are so many scratches on the plates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not ever buy another Shany item again.</li>
    <li> I ordered the plates because there were certain images I saw in the promo that I wanted and when the plates arrived I did not have the images I expected. For example, I saw a plate with some letters and when the plates arrived it was a plate with oriental like symbols. They looked pretty but I have no idea what the were or meant.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it was okay!</li>
    <li> Plates are very flimsy. but that dont effect that stamp quality for me at all. Images are same size as first set and are for shorter nails. etching seems fine and I have not noticed imperfections that interefer with the image. some deep scratches on the sides of some plates but not directly over the image. Very disapointed as other companies have taken extra effort to make sure they put quality into there sets which seem to be lacking from this company....so far. I still like the set and am satisfies with this purchase. I hope shany takes some consideration into there next set. Us nail lovers are willing to pay more for better quality.</li>
    <li> I like these plates. there&#x27;s a lot of variety and a little something for most occasions. Most are not full nail designs, but more for accents.</li>
    <li> The images are not deep enough to make the transfer successful to the nail.  I used these in conjunction with the SHANY stamp kit.  They just don&#x27;t work.  I&#x27;m glad they weren&#x27;t super expensive, but upset that they do as they promised.</li>
    <li> Full images are too small for my nails, and I dont have really big nails just my natyral. Unles you have very short nails I would recomend it otherwise not. The small images are great!</li>
    <li> These are some of the plates I have used more often considering I own several sets and this are just lovely to add to your collection.</li>
    <li> I love everything about this product. Each design is wonderful. A great product. I would buy from again in the future, Thanks</li>
    <li> Got these as a starter set, and as a \\&quot;starter\\&quot; set for stamping, these are fine.  NOW.. I will say I have average (not large) nail beds, not tiny, but definitely not small either. I will outline the pros and cons here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRO:&lt;br /&gt;* nice variety of subjects, objects, designs and \\&quot;textures\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;* small and easy to handle&lt;br /&gt;* stamps take polish well and transfers pretty good, BUT FIRST I have to clean them between stamps for them to work 100%, (which is normal)&lt;br /&gt;* they fit into generic small round stamping cases fine&lt;br /&gt;* you get 25 plates with a bunch of designs/objects on each one, which is a great deal&lt;br /&gt;* looks like they do have a backing on them now for support and to help reduce the sharpness&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE MEH or SO-SO: * the storage box these came in was just \\&quot;OK\\&quot;, but I ordered a case for them the next day after I received them, because in the little square black paperboard case they came in, you can not view of find the plates you want easily.  Invest a few bucks in a decent bound case for easy viewing, selecting and storage.  SO.....I ordered and LOVE the \\&quot;PUEEN 168 Nail Stamping Plates Synthetic Leather Holder Case Organizer\\&quot; for $15.99 via PRIME on Amazon.  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HMIPKTE/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rev_prod_title&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* the entire nail designs, for example the snake skin texture stamp, will NOT cover my entire thumbnail, I do NOT have huge nails, just average, and these just are not big enough to cover the entire nail unfortunately.  There is a boarder of base polish around the nail. These seem like they were made for VERY petite/small nails.  I&#x27;m not the only reviewer who noticed this as well. (I included a photo of this as well)  This problem is noted with every single one of the \\&quot;larger\\&quot; rectangular imprint stamps on the plates.  They were made for people with very tiny thumbnail beds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* the blue protective shield covering that goes over the top of the plates when you get them is so difficult to get off, you have to use something sharp to rip it a little so you can peel it off! (Which scratches the plate a little) THESE SHOULD HAVE A SMALL PULL TAB FOR EASY REMOVAL!  My nails weren&#x27;t even good enough to get these off.  (I included a photos of this)  It took about 25 minutes to get all of them off the plates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* the edges can be sharp.  Be careful.  I didn&#x27;t find it a huge issue, but if a child were working with them or playing around with them, scratches or cuts could happen.  They have included a backing on them now I see (another earlier review noted they didn&#x27;t have a backing and cut her fingers), but now they do, but they can still be sharp at the right angle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO, my review overall is that this is a good \\&quot;Starter\\&quot; set for stamping.  But the lack of a decent thumbnail bed coverage, the degree of difficulty to get off the protective plastic coating prior to first use and sharp~ish edges were the pitfalls.ficult to get off, you have to use something sharp to rip it a little so you can peel it off!

    <li> Love these plates they produced great images</li>
    <li> I love these , almost too many to chose from , but that&#x27;s not a bad thing glad I got them .</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve already got tons of ideas for these. a friend&#x27;s daughter seen em and was like wow! i can&#x27;t wait to use em!!</li>
    <li> These plates have a lot of cute designs. Valentine&#x27;s Day, Halloween, Christmas, stars, zebra stripes, flowers, and more...They work well. First time using them and everything went smooth. Will buy of these plates again.</li>
    <li> Wife and daughter get plenty of use out of these. They love them</li>
    <li> I would have liked more of a variety of holiday images.  Wish it came with instructions, had to look up instructions online.</li>
    <li> I would recommend.&lt;br /&gt;Great plates, nice designs.&lt;br /&gt;No problem with designs transferring.&lt;br /&gt;Packaged very well. Cute little reusable box.&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased.</li>
    <li> These plates work just fine. The blue film is easy to remove. They storage box is okay. They are easy to clean. The images transfer cleanly. I do recommend using a plastic gift card or something vs. the scraper that SHANY sells. The scraper scratches your plates. I gave this product 5 of 5 stars because they work as promised. I would buy this product again (I buy the new bundle every year). I would recommend this product. I payed $15.98 and free S&amp;H when I purchased his product.</li>
    <li> Overall these plates are nice but there are a few that were not cut properly so they are pretty much useless.</li>
    <li> Ordered these July 23rd, and they never shipped due to a delay. I gave up waiting because as of writing this on October 4th, another delay happened. Giving up after 2 months of waiting. I even contacted Amazon and they said there was a delay and there was nothing they can do. This was supposed to be a birthday present but so much for that. Very disappointed because I bought the other sets for her and they were great, but I&#x27;m sick of tying up my money for something that will never ship.</li>
    <li> Got the plates, but the designs on them are not what was in the picture.  Totally different plates, very dissatisfied &amp; have had to wait way to long for something that isn&#x27;t what I ordered.  I will be more careful to not order from this company again.  Thanks for taking my money and sending me plates that I did not order.</li>
    <li> Lots of great designs! I don&#x27;t think I had any repeated plates. If so, not more than 1 or 2. These are very easy to use with a good stamper. The case isn&#x27;t something I expect to last very long though.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t work very well, it&#x27;s hard to get them (stamps) to transport from the stamper to the nail perfectly but it could be the polish or my technique so who knows, it takes too long to use it for a manicure. I don&#x27;t know why I bought this. I think I even had to buy the stamper and scraper separate. Never gain.</li>
    <li> They have a lot design to choose from the stamps. However it kind sharp and thin too.</li>
    <li> Nice Shany nail plates. Many nice designs on these plates and they transfer color very well using your nail stamp. Easy to work with!</li>
    <li> The templates came scratched. but overall the item was alright.</li>
    <li> I love your products and I am sad to learn the plate #SH 210 hello kitty mushroom was not in the kit I did NOT get any HELLO KITTY stamp plates also... no Mickey mouse either why??? Please help me complete this order !  My daughter is very sad this was not in her order as displayed.</li>
    <li> I love these nail plates! They stamp very easily and show up well on nails! Some of the designs are goofy, but a lot of them are really fun.</li>
    <li> Very cute designs. I have done 100s of tutorials and new looks for myself friends and family they are very easy to use too.</li>
    <li> I bought this collection of plates b/c of the cartoons. It has Mickey Mouse and angry birds. Nice storing case/ Flimsy plates. Chicky plates are stronger.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to stamping and honestly haven&#x27;t mastered it yet but I think the process would be a lot easier if the designs were a bit bigger so as to maybe make a bigger mess but make sure I get the design all over the nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the main reason why I gave it 4 stars is that despite it does what it promised, I got the same plate twice (SH#219) so technically this is a 24 plate set (I see no benefit in having 2 plates with same design).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I promptly contacted amazon and asked if there was a way I could contact the seller directly. Unfortunately that is not an option but amazon customer service quickly offered me 2 options: to refund 15% of the initial cost or to return the product for a full refund. I replied that neither of those options worked for me and asked to contact seller. Finally they offered a 30% refund which I took for the inconvenience alone since there was really no other way of going about this (I wanted the rest of the plates so returning the whole thing didn&#x27;t make sense to me)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite all this, I&#x27;m having fun practicing stamping designs and hope I can show them off in the near future.</li>
    <li> My plates were fine when they came in the mail but I&#x27;m finding it hard to get a decent image.  I have used others but for some reason it seems the engraving/etching is too ... shallow and I can&#x27;t get them to stamp.  It&#x27;s a shame because I purchases these especially for the Hello Kitty images.  Unless I can figure out how to get these to stamp, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying anymore Shany.  I&#x27;ll stick to Mash.</li>
    <li> I love these designs. Very versatile and girly. I&#x27;ve been obsessed with doing my nails. The only reason why I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is because a couple of the templates were scratched.</li>
    <li> I love this product and I am very pleased with my purchase! It is exactly what i was looking for, to add to my collection!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product. They work very well.Will purchase more in the future. Love them. I would recommend this product to all people who love painting your own nails and creating awesome designs!!</li>
    <li> The plates are covered in a protective plastic which is removed for future use. Scratching does not look like it will be a problem as each plate has a non-scratch backing to avoid this when stacking. The picture stamps obviously fit any nail, but found the patterns were a bit too small to cover the whole nail. This problem is on short nails, so it would definitely not work on long nails. It is a pity because there is a nice selection of designs</li>
    <li> Excited to use and interchange designs. Hopefully I can come up with some fun designs with all the great patterns to select from.</li>
    <li> Some of the full nail stamp don&#x27;t cover the entire nail. I have short nails and thin fingers. Mostly does not cover the thumb nail. I am new to stamping and I thought all the other stamps worked great. I wish I looked around more. I just found these Pueen stamps that cover the whole plate. I will be trying those soon too.</li>
    <li> These are good plates, maybe not the best you could get. some of the patterns are very small and not deep enough to get good coverage for your nail. Others the patterns don&#x27;t fit well to create patterns on larger (thumb) nails. I would suggest looking for different plates that have deeper and larger imprints. This however is a good set to get started as it has many patterns that are actually really good!</li>
    <li> I just received this today and got to work on my nails. I also have monster stamping plates and these worked better than those. Very cute designs, pefect for valentines day. I will be ordering more from Shany Cosmetics.</li>
    <li> this product is so amazing! i love the way my nails look when stamped and these are so easy to use!!!just remember that you also need the scraper and stamper to use them!</li>
    <li> I was bummed to look through the plates and realize there wasn&#x27;t a Hello Kitty plate. I specifically picked these plates for that reason. :/</li>
    <li> As pictured. As described. I would definitely purchase again. Great selection of various stamping plates. Quick shipping. Just need a book to keep them in now! :)</li>
    <li> The box kept the items packaged, when the rest of the package was damaged in transit and are great. Tested and are working exactly how I needed.  Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> One word - Fabulous! Stamps great and love the designs. The protective box is a bonus!</li>
    <li> These are fun plates, I have only used a few of them, but so far I am getting really good images.  Good variety and easy to use.</li>
    <li> These are great! I received all 25 and all are perfect (no scratches). I&#x27;ve tried designs on four of the plates and they all came out great. Excellent variety of designs. The full-nail designs won&#x27;t be big enough if you have large nail beds or really long nails unless you stamp them twice.</li>
    <li> I specifically ordered this for an image of the plate shown with Mickey Mouse stamps. The plate that came in did not have the stamps. A couple other designs were also missing.</li>
    <li> These are awesome!  Love them and such a great variety of designs!</li>
    <li> I really like the selection of images.  Some of them are very close together, so you have to be careful when applying the polish image to the stamp.</li>
    <li> Images wouldn&#x27;t pick up. The ones that did pick up only came up half on. Two of the plates were supposed to be hello kitty and were of course something I&#x27;d never use. And my 3 year old daughter wasn&#x27;t happy about that part either. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Can’t say more than what the previous reviewers have had said, really loved it, loved the variety, loved the whole package</li>
    <li> These took sooo long to deliver like more than a month. The images are not the same as the pictures. The images are not long enough or wide enough for my nail beds. They came all out of order in the box. I wish I would have listened to the other reviews and saved my money!</li>
    <li> I usually purchase from another company and have really enjoyed their product.  I was concerned when I purchased such a large supply of Shany Plates.  I was thrill to see that they worked very well.  My girls have really enjoyed our spa afternoons and highly recommend this product.  It may take a little practice but it is worth it!  Thanks for the fast shipment.!</li>
    <li> Some very nice designs on the plates.  Unfortunately the full-size images are too small to completely cover my thumbnails :-( and I don&#x27;t even have large hands. That would be my only regret about these plates -- I wish the images were larger because doing full nail stamping is my favorite.</li>
    <li> This is a great set! Works great!!</li>
    <li> complicated, does not give the shapes , very hard to apply and to clean , i really didn&#x27;t know how to use it</li>
    <li> Some of the etchings don&#x27;t transfer as well-- but for the price, it&#x27;s really great!</li>
    <li> When the package came I got it all excited and it was all scratched up and I ordered it from NEW!!! This is ridiculous!</li>
    <li> I bought them for a couple of images.  Plus, the price was right. They are smaller than my BMC plates, but, I had a bit of trouble fitting it into my Pueen plate holder book. Strange. Odd shape, I guess.  I played around a lot trying to get the images to stamp clean. I had missing areas,  streaky images, distortion upon rolling. I am using the same Konad stamper, and technique that I normally use, and I am not a novice. Finally, I just decided that the mani was 4th of July themed and if the stars and stripes were wavy, it would look like the flag was waving. I kept them because I never return anything and I use them for kids nails, especially the younger ones who are going to mess stuff up quick.</li>
    <li> love different designs n most pick up well</li>
    <li> These are amazing! The designs are all different categories, which is nice. Very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying more from this seller!</li>
    <li> Because we like your stuff  price is ok to only thing I don&#x27;t like for delivery so far so other every thing was good</li>
    <li> it was a simple to use product. super easy to use. it is just what it describes. this is WAY WAY better then the first set they put out.</li>
    <li> These take patience to learn how to get good at it. My advice is to place the stencil plate on a flat surface when scraping the excess polish off and rolling your stamp to pick up the image.</li>
    <li> when will i  get this item is really want it, This is a very long waiting period to wait to get something from onlne</li>
    <li> This is a good product and some came scratched but who cares! I really was looking toward to the apple sign but it wasn&#x27;t there. U always have to be grateful for what you get though!</li>
    <li> Works great with very professional look</li>
    <li> Good stencils. Wished designs were better though.</li>
    <li> A few of the plates seemed close to the edge but plate SH208 is not usable.  Total misprint. However, the ones I have tried seem to work.  Edit    It took me years to try these.   Some are so shallow that don&#x27;t work.   I&#x27;ve gotten much better plates since.  These are not the worst out there but not great either.   Plus, These must be for small nails.  Designs fit well for my 10 year old but not my adult hands.</li>
    <li> These images are to small for my nails. Wish i didn&#x27;t get them. My nails aren&#x27;t very long either maybe 3-4 millimeters from finger tip</li>
    <li> I have been using the stamps on both of my daughters&#x27; nails every week since we got them. There are some really nice designs on them. I also like that each stamp has a paper (or some thing like that) backing so that they don&#x27;t rub and scrape on each other. Just make sure to get a good stamper...I bought one of those from Amazon as well. Just an FYI, make sure you file the stamper before you use it on the stamping kit. It will pick up and transfer the nail polish much better. MORE TIPS: (1) use an old gift card to scrape the excess nail polish off the stamp. (2) Dip a cotton swab in nail polish remover and blot it on the stamp to clean the fine lines. (3) Thick nail polishes work the best for stamping. Doesn&#x27;t matter what brand, as long as its thick. We use Essie, Sally Hansen, and even Sinful Colors (the cheap $2 brand).</li>
    <li> I loved it :D&lt;br /&gt;except some one of them were rusted in the image .&lt;br /&gt;but other than that i love it .&lt;br /&gt;only downfall is that it doesnt cover my whole thumb nail. its perfect for everything else.&lt;br /&gt;but if u have long . or kinda wide nails . it will be a struggle lol.&lt;br /&gt;but def. worth it for the price :D</li>
    <li> I love the concept of this art, but its very hard to get the hang of it.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t seem to get the same results as what I&#x27;ve seen on YouTube.&lt;br /&gt;I will keep practicing..... and hope I get better.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, its good.&lt;br /&gt;Sandy</li>
    <li> Great product. The plates are rally nice and they work great.</li>
    <li> The set was ok, but the pictures showed are not what you get. BEWARE</li>
    <li> a waste of money!! The plate designs are so shallow that it is impossible to pick them up on the stamp.  Now I understand why they are so cheap.  I already threw them in the garbage (on the same day they arrived) and ordered the Konad image plates, which by the way are fantastic).  Don&#x27;t waste your money on these.</li>
    <li> Oh my gosh this set is so cool.  It is by far the best image plate set I have purchased.  I like the variety with the images (also had Christmas, Valentines, and Independence Day themes).  I&#x27;m not sure if every set varies but I like the selection I get to choose from.  Makes nail art so simple.</li>
    <li> Lots of fun to work with. A lot of choices for patterns. Easy to use, easy to clean. Nice product. Very fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my bundle of plates for about a year now. There are a variety of designs to use, from a French tip style to full nail to some fun holiday designs. I like how there&#x27;s a variety in complexity, too. There are plenty of simple designs for beginners to start with so they can get a feel for stamping, and there are some very complex designs as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several other users have stated some designs are not big enough. My nails are fairly long and go over my fingertips and I&#x27;ve had few problems, although my thumb will have to take 1 1/2 stamps on certain designs for full coverage. Still, 90% of the time I&#x27;m fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even after a year, over half of my plates still have the blue plastic over them. I believe it&#x27;s a mixture of not getting to some and no interest in some of the designs. However, I would still gladly recommend this product to anyone who is looking for some stamping plates at a good price.</li>
    <li> these plates are AWESOME!!! and they pair up well with the PUEEN soft squishy stamper!!</li>
    <li> Se las regale a mi cuñada y después de unos días de práctica le quedan muy bien. Va a pedir más.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my stepdaughter so that she could have fun with nail art, without having to be an artist!  We&#x27;ve had some fun with what I could do on her tiny nails!  Some plates work better than others.</li>
    <li> I am fairly new to stamping and this was my first set. I have to admit I found it kind of difficult to stamp some of the things but I believe it&#x27;s because a lot of the drawings are way too tiny and have a lot of detail.I only had problems with smaller and more detailed drawings but usually in two or three tries I got a perfect stamp. Anyways, I&#x27;ve been using this set for about a month and I&#x27;ve done plenty of stamping and I don&#x27;t see a problem with them. Granted they were a bit sharp around the edges but I never cut myself with them. It&#x27;s true that they do bend easy, but i don&#x27;t see how anyone would bend them since you&#x27;re supposed to have them flat on a surface. The plastic covering that they come with made it seem like the come all scratched up but once you remove them you see that it was the plastic and not the plates.</li>
    <li> The plates are now buffed, so no sharp edges. I got no repeats and a bunch off different size designs. The only thing that took forever was getting the blue layer off the plates. I found using tweezers made it much easier to remove. Would be another set.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to nail stamping, and wanted to make sure I got a good variety of plates before I got started. This 25-plate set from SHANY Cosmetics was a great choice to get me started!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I&#x27;m just starting, I really wanted to have a lot of images to choose from so I wouldn&#x27;t get bored with practicing. These 25 plates were all unique with no duplicates and carry a wide array of designs to choose from! There are a large number of full nail designs that are surprisingly easy to match up and repeat on larger nails like thumbnails, as well as a lot of smaller, more whimsical images and design elements. The art ranges from punk (checkerboard nails, anyone?) to holiday to animal prints and everything in between, so there&#x27;s always an image to fit my mood or a new nail polish color!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even with how inexpensive these plates are they work very well for transferring images! I&#x27;ve had no problems spreading or picking up polish, even on the most intricate of designs. The blue plastic film is easy to remove with a pin or a set of tweezers and the plates are a beautiful shiny silver color. They&#x27;re about the size of a micro CD and I&#x27;ve found that the best way to store plates that have had their film removed is in an old CD book, jsut so that they don&#x27;t accidentally scratch each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had a blast using these nail stamping plates and have more than enough images to keep me happy for quite a while! I&#x27;m very impressed with SHANY and will be back in the future for more plates!</li>
    <li> They have great designs and are easy to clean, plus it comes on their own case.&lt;br /&gt;Nice quality of the plates.</li>
    <li> They all stamped nicley.  Nice selection.  I use a old credit card instead of a metal scrapper otherwise they scratch up pretty good.</li>
    <li> The pack came in good. And I received all my plates. There are come scuffs and scratches, but I doubt it will affect the stamping. Some scuffs are close to the image and some are not close at all. My nails are naturally long. I have long nail beds and they grow long, so the full images will most likely not fit on my nails, I can&#x27;t wait to use them all.</li>
    <li> The full size designs are on the small side. Only a few cover my nails and my nails aren&#x27;t that long. They stamp well though.</li>
    <li> Bought these and want to do my nails almost everyday just to try new designs. like being able to do these at home and not pay someone for art on my nails</li>
    <li> WORKS PERFECTLY LOVE IT, LOVE ALL THE DIFFERENT DESIGNS, WOULD RECOMMENDED IT TO EVERYONE LOOKING FOR SOME NEW NAIL DESIGNS</li>
    <li> I really like these plates, saw a review on YouTube and decided to get them. Cute designs, good price; and I&#x27;m always impressed when the packaging is nice too. The only downside is that image plate #202 has an error. The plate #201 features hello kitty designs; the plate #202 is supposed to feature christmas snowman designs. Mine had two of the hello kitty images engraved around one of the the snowman images. :(</li>
    <li> Love these plates easy to use and give nice detail to someone that is wanting to look amazing in every detail!</li>
    <li> I made this request in hello kitty drawings and did not arrive in its place comes a plate with Chinese symbols letters or something if I do not like pictures of the dishes send this kitty because otherwise the other hand I placed my order in September I did not get my claim reimbursed me my money and went back to make the order and now if I get what I seemed fine.</li>
    <li> I love the Shany plates, there is only one image that does not work for me. Other than that I am thrilled with these plates. I especially like the container they come in, it is magnetized to stay shut. It is easy for me to keep them all in one place.  I would recommend this set to other nail enthusiasts.</li>
    <li> love mine! there are tons and tons of images to choose from and they work every bit as well as the konad stamps. some images are a little more difficult to pick up than others, but they still work wonders!</li>
    <li> i absolutely love this set but it was really smaller then what i expected :(  great buy just need to be bigger</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m very pleased with the product. today I did my first stamping and I love the results. Prints are awesome and stamps are perfect, without any physical damages.</li>
    <li> Can’t say more than what the previous reviewers have had said, really loved it, loved the variety, loved the whole package</li>
    <li> Honestly this was my first time buying image plates. After looking at the reviews I took a chance on these praying to high heaven I didn&#x27;t get the ones that were double stamped or defected plates. I was excited once i got them. They were all packaged nicely in a compact box however the one plate that had sold me on getting this particular batch was the stamp with the mickey mouse image on it. And when i reached that image i was shocked to see it was the one out of the 25 that was the one with a defect. So yes i&#x27;m sorely disappointed. But hey for the price and the fact i still have 24 good ones, out of the twenty five i&#x27;m giving them 4 stars, 3 1/2 if i could. It came before the said date, and i got more bang for my buck then the 5 dollar a plate ones. Will i buy from them again? Probably not.</li>
    <li> I received the package on time unfortunatly I ordered specifically  for disk SH210 that in the picture indicates 2 different hello kitties, a purse and so on. However, when I received it. It includs a disk SH210 but has only chinese letters. I am so disapointed. I don&#x27;t understand why you do this. If this is not what you are going to send, you should not include in the picture. I really want Hello Kitty stamps because I already had the other ones. :&#x27;(</li>
    <li> I really like this product, it really works. It is simple and easy to use and you don&#x27;t really need to buy the special nail polish to use them.</li>
    <li> I returned this product the first time because the Hello Kitty Plate was not in there, when I opened my second package to replace the first incomplete product it still did not include the the Hello Kitty Plate. I&#x27;m sending this back and getting a refund.</li>
    <li> The box holding the plates was damaged. One of the plates had the designs printed incorrectly/off the plate, rendering it useless (the plate w chinese kanjis). All other plates were fine....not going to bother w a return or replacement claim purely to save the headache. Disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: After playing with most of the \\&quot;whole nail\\&quot; patterns, they are not wide enough to cover the whole nail. While I may not have the smallest nails in the world, my nails are of average length/width. If you have wider nails, I suggest going w a diff brand. I will be going with Cheeky brand or Monsterbundle from now on.</li>
    <li> This has been a real treat and they come out very nicely done.  Easy to use and offer the opportunity to experiment and practice. This has been an excellent investment for my grand daughter and she uses them over and over.  I world recommend this to my friends.</li>
    <li> works great and has great designs</li>
    <li> I read some reviews where people did not get all plates as shown. I got all of them. Some of them had deep scratches that passed the blue plastic protection. Not a big deal for me. Love them!</li>
    <li> These are great plates they work well as long as u know how to stamp you can make any image fit your nail try turning it side ways I love mine and they have sharp images.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a used product, and the owner mention they all new. I will not buy anything from this owner again.</li>
    <li> very happy with the plates with super fast delivery</li>
    <li> I loved the 1st set Shany put out so was excited to get this 2nd set. The plates are very thin so I did cut myself pulling them out of the box. I then saw on plate 202 there was a cat stamped next to the snowman - so the stamp came over from the 1st plate so that image is not usable. Then I received 2 of the 204 plate and 214 was missing. I emailed Shany and figured I would give them time to respond and maybe replace those 2 plates. I have not heard from them, it has been a week. So I would be reluctant to purchase from them again although I do love the images and most of them stamp nicely. So good deal for the cost but I wish they would make it right. So check your set when you get them and be careful not to cut yourself.</li>
    <li> My niece loved these decorative adhesive designers for her nails. They came on all different kinds of designs and they were a perfect Christmas gift. They came before the expected delivery date.</li>
    <li> I love these plates!  I use them on my nails, and on my daughters nails.  They transfer perfectly, and clean up just fine.  I have nothing bad to say about these. Give them a try.</li>
    <li> Grand daughter very happy with this product. She is always doing her nails and mine and paints all kinds of designs on our nails. This product makes it so easy and looks so nice. Thank you</li>
    <li> It should&#x27;ve included some instructions with it. At least tell me what I need to make it work.</li>
    <li> I love the plates and these work great with any nailpolish. None of the plates had any scratches on them. They shipped very very quickly! Love them and enjoy so much all the very cute designs!</li>
    <li> great plates that stamp really well!! very cute designs and I recommend them for anyone looking for an overall great collection to add to or start a nail stamping plate collection.</li>
    <li> I loved the variety of designs. I marked it a star down because some of the designs don&#x27;t pick up as well.  I use the konad scraper and stamp. For the price, it is worth it.</li>
    <li> Was disappointed it was missing the hello kitty. Totally sad.</li>
    <li> Like the plates, cute images. Need a more secure case but useful, hard to take off blue plastic, need the red tab to peel bk easier. Good delivery time. Would order again. Thanks</li>
    <li> There are SO MANY amazing designs in this package I am at a loss of where to start!  I can&#x27;t pick my favorite by far.  ANYONE can use the stamping kits, and being able to grab such fantastic deals on SO MANY new plates is mind boggling!  Thanks to the Seller, Fantastic transaction. Will definitely be ordering more SHANY COSMETICS product in the future. Thanks!  A++</li>
    <li> Not happy about this purchase, the damn thing won&#x27;t work.  I&#x27;ve tried every polish that I have and also every stamping plate, nothing....</li>
    <li> Got this set and one other for my wife and daughter since they are nail FREAKS.  It seems to work great and they absolutly love them!  Most family functions now end up turning into a nail party for all the girls.  To the best of my knowledge, they haven&#x27;t come across a bad plate yet in either set.</li>
    <li> I love the plates that was sent.. I only got 24 and it say there is 25.. The plate that&#x27;s is missing was sh210.. That was the reason y I got this set...</li>
    <li> I have seen a few videos on these and they seemed to be good reviews. Boy they were wrong, not happy with this purchase at all. The plates bend so easy, the came with scratches on the actual plates. They are def not for bigger nail beds. These are made for children. I will not purchase from Shaney again unless they get it together. Think I will stick with Cheeky. Seems to be the best brand for me. Buyer beware the plates also have sharp edges.</li>
    <li> I have tried two of the plates.  It appears the machine that makes the plates may need some calibration because some of the patterns are either deep or shallow.  When they are too deep, the pattern smudges because you get too much polish.  When the pattern is shallow, it is hard to get a good transfer because you don&#x27;t get enough polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plates come in a nice little box that closes magnetically.  Just looking at them, they seem to be ok and I like most of the patterns.  Here are my overall ratings:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delivery:  Good - Ordered on 4/23 and received 4/29/2013&lt;br /&gt;Completeness:  Excellent - I received all plates, 201 - 225&lt;br /&gt;Quality:  Poor - Almost all plates are either discolored or scratched (11 out of the 25 are scratched).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I immediately contacted Amazon to replace some of the worse scratched plates.  They offered for me to return all the plates and they would replace them.  I was not willing to do this because I was concerned with the quality of the next delivery.  I just did not want to take a chance my next delivery would not be complete.  I&#x27;ll will probably have to avoid the badly scratched patterns.</li>
    <li> I received this overall the plates are nice but&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;of the 25 plates i recieved with this set 4 had rustspots/discoloration and 3 were badly etched one was so badly etched it was unusable</li>
    <li> Maybe I am not fast enough, or I am doing it wrong? They are cute, however I like the larger plates as they give you more room to get the image on your stamper. Very hard to get the blue sticky tape off the plates. They are a little sharp on the bottom even though there is a film covering it. The images don&#x27;t transfer as nicely as the other plates I have.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love nail stamping plates, and I have been getting my family to try them. I bought three sets: one for myself, and two for family members. I was worried after reading other reviews about the plates being scratched up and of bad quality especially since I was sending two sets to family members, but they all look great and came organized in a little box. You really can&#x27;t beat the price either! I&#x27;ve already collected 96 plates because they are just so awesome!</li>
    <li> Cannot get a good image from these</li>
    <li> Great shipping time got here 2 days before advised. Plates are nice- will need some practice to get some images on to nail. Great buy if you love art nail!</li>
    <li> Love these! They come in a cute box for storage which is great because my others are in a ziploc bag! Just know you get 25 plates and they are individually shrink wrapped so you have to spend about 15-20 mins just getting them all unpackaged but worth it! Such great styles and etched better than my other set so I always get a great transfer.</li>
    <li> My first time using these plates and I LOVE it. It has different designs and its easy to use.  I used any regular polish using a konad nail stamping tool.</li>
    <li> I was excited to receive these in the mail, but when I was removing the blue film, I began to realize I have a whole different set than shown in the initial pictures. I was a bit disappointed because I really liked the set shown in the pictures.</li>
    <li> It more than met my expectations and the fact that it is held in the box was another good thing, thanks</li>
    <li> These plates have cute designs, but some don&#x27;t work for long nails. If you have shorter nails most will work for you. Some of the designs are meant for a full nail design, but it didn&#x27;t work for me because my nails are long (not too long). I was stuck using the single smaller designs to use as an accent. I definitely should have purchased the other nail plates.</li>
    <li> My fianc&amp;eacute; bought this for me for my birthday and I absolutely love it. There are so many different designs that I will never run out of ways to paint my nails.</li>
    <li> These are SO cute!! There are 25 plates, so great price! nicely boxes, and so far (I&#x27;ve used about 10) they all work fantastic..  I love the section... the creative possibilities are endless</li>
    <li> The image sort of made it look like there would be sleeves or some sort of protection in the storage case, but there aren&#x27;t. Other than that I like it. Good plates and a nice compact box to store them in!</li>
    <li> I was really excited to get this set, thought the images were cute and that my daughters would love them.  I was so excited that I bought two, one for myself and one for a gift.  When they arrived I opened my set . . . the plates are very thin and bend easily.  One was actually bent already in the box.  A couple of the plates were scratched after I removed the plastic protection.  I was missing one plate out of the package completely.  The full nail images are tiny and will only cover my pinky -- most are 3/4 of an inch wide and long, some an inch, either way not long enough for someone with long nails or wide enough for anyone that doesn&#x27;t have tiny hands.  Add to that some of the flaws in the images -- like paw print missing toes so you have 2 toed puppy prints, it&#x27;s just bad bad bad.  Such a shame, I had to return them!</li>
    <li> there are alot of good images here but you have to watch the sharp edges, and there are other quality issues too</li>
    <li> fun and really easy to use! I love all the designs on my plates. They&#x27;re so cute! Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product along with the Mash set. I was nervous because of the bad reviews ! They shipped fast and I was very nervous when I opened it. I don&#x27;t know what these other people got because my set was perfect the plates are defiantly NOT thin they are as thick as they could be. Yea some of the stupid designs I won&#x27;t use but who cares ? They stamp AMAZINGLY and were so cheap ! I will defiantly be ordering more from this company. Don&#x27;t be scared by the bad reviews ! It was 100% worth it ! They even came in a cute little container !</li>
    <li> Some designs are bad.  that its so hard to stamp on the nail.. i mean not perfectly nice on the nail.. it doesnt cover the entire nail..</li>
    <li> Great way to try out stamping for the first time.  I bought it along with the Pueen stamping set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not all images are deep enough - but trial end error will help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Very Affordable&lt;br /&gt;- Great Variety of Designs&lt;br /&gt;- Fast Shipping&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Packaging is cheap BUT most stamping plates don&#x27;t even come with packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set is very cheap as is and I got it when Amazon had a coupon available. I have already tried and am very impressed. It stamps quiet well and there is a great variety of designs. The bow is okay and the insert is Styrofoam but whatever works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have included pictures of the designs and packaging + Mani that I used plate SH22 with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The designs are fairly generic and include several animal prints, geometric design, a few small flower and cartoon animals. There is also one Christmas plate.</li>
    <li> These plates are ok for the money, however they are not Konad plates. Some of the stamps are so shallow it is almost impossible to pick up a complete image. But, it was a good deal and I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> I thought that these nail stamps were pretty good.  They worked well and yes my plates were scratched as well but still usable and I got 2 sets of duplicate plates :(.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty well made product of durable metal.  Just keep in mind that it is not a How to kit that shows you what to do.  You or in my case your teenage daughter will need to figure out how to use them yourself.  We did eventually and she is happy with them.</li>
    <li> I was very happy to buy the product but when it arrived the product was damaged. It was scratched on all plates and it was bent. The images are very nice.</li>
    <li> But to me the images are boring, that&#x27;s the only reason that I gave 4 stars instead of 5. Make sure you really like the images before you purchase.</li>
    <li> I really love these stamping plates. They are worth the money! The only issue I would say is that some of the images are too small to fit the whole nail, that&#x27;s OK though I just figure out other creative ways to use them. This is my first time using stamping plates and I&#x27;m impressed. Just a tip if you are having trouble try scraping in a different direction that has helped me a lot.</li>
    <li> they&#x27;re beautiful easy to use I wish the sticky cover was easier to get off</li>
    <li> I got this pack mostly because I was going to Disneyland and it has the super cute Mickey Mouse ears print. My nails looked SO cute!! Worked really well. It was my first time using image plates and was impressed.</li>
    <li> Pleased with order. Item was as described.</li>
    <li> I love that it comes with its own case, none of the design plates are the same, they&#x27;re all different, and there are even designs for kids which comes in handy for me, and some holiday designs too, just love it!!</li>
    <li> I stayed away from this nail art trend for so long, but when I stumbled across these Shany plates for such a great price, I couldn&#x27;t pass them up! It takes a bit to get the hang of it, but once you do it&#x27;s a breeze. They&#x27;re a really fun way to decorate your nails, especially if you&#x27;re not so good with free hand nail art. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying different styles from Shany. Great gift for anyone who is into nail art!</li>
    <li> These suck! First off I got them and they were all scratched up like they were used before. And also the plates were not deep enough to hold the image!! Terrible product.</li>
    <li> I was impressed with the amount of plates and designs for the price. It stores nicely and is pretty compact. I was worried about there being a lot of designs I wouldn&#x27;t use but for the most part they are all ones I will use.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these plates. I bought a stamp about a year or 2 ago and the plates that came with it were absolute crap. They didn&#x27;t pick up the nail polish well at all. No worries with these plates. 98% of the time I am able to pick up the design with no problems at all. Plus, the designs are great. there are a wide variety of designs even holiday ones. THE ONLY ISSUE I HAD was one of the designs werent complete so I cant use that one. I will email the company to get issue resolved.</li>
    <li> Recieved a duplicate plate and was missing another one.  I called the company and they sent me the missing plate.  The images are small which is exactly why I purchased them.  My teenager has very small nails and we have a hard time fitting designs on her.  These stamp well and the customer service is excellent.  I would buy again.</li>
    <li> The product was with super protection.  A big box for a tiny product. I love that. The designs are all beautiful and cute, rose, smiles, Christmas tree, stars, dogs, anything that you can to imagine. The product arrived on time.</li>
    <li> I was overall disappointed in the quality of these image plates and the size. I have previously ordered MASH plates and have been very happy with the quality and was on the fence about these because of poor previous reviews. The plates are very thin and will cut you if your not careful, Images are not fully etched in all the plates, and full images are tiny and may not fit a full nail for stamping. I have incredibly tiny nails and even I cannot get complete coverage on some of my nails.  I will not be purchasing from vendor unless quality increases on the plates.  Gave 3 stars because designs that do work are very cute and not a bad bargain for amount you get, though not all plates or images will be usable.</li>
    <li> NICE SET OF STAMPING PLATES I AM HAVING SO MUCH FUN TRYING THEM OUT! THANK YOU FOR GREAT SERVICE! :)</li>
    <li> This is my first attempt at stamping.  Some designs are great, some are a challenge.  But it&#x27;s fun!</li>
    <li> Lets start with the count, 25 counts is enough for any beginners, I bundled this with bundle monster image plates carrying case and I&#x27;m happy as hell. The plates are about 0.2 smaller than konad plates, they are thick, and images are sharp and deep. Some flowers and tiny design are hard to stamp, but I think its just their nature, you cant stamp a mini flower easily. The set came in a large carrying case, unlike the set#1. There are more texture in this set, compare to #2.  I decided to get this after reading reviews, it seems like reviews are written by other brands, since they are pretty biased and obvious, I knew that the new item wouldn&#x27;t get rating like this, so I just trusted the brand, which it paid off to me. Some had said about scratches, and honestly, if you don&#x27;t know that you have to remove a BLUE film off, you better not use DIY nail accessories, I have Bundle monster, Red angel and shany plates and they all come with a blue file on top, which you have to remove before the use. How can you even put the nail polish on it if you haven&#x27;t removed the film! That&#x27;s why some says the images are not deep enough and plates are scratch. I really don&#x27;t have  an interest on neither brand, but shany was on sale and Amazon had given me $10 coupon, so I spent half of my bonus check on this brand, shopping for family and friends and myself. I think I spent total $250 on multiple items, and it&#x27;s well worth it. I pretty much got everything that I needed , except their large makeup case, which was a little too pricey for me. But let&#x27;s get back to the image plates, the smallest designs is a nice orchid flower which is 0.2 inches, and the largest design is the 1 inch, texture pattern. The pattern are extremely fun to work, and if you need my opinion, you should buy all red angel, bundle monster and shnay plates to have all the texture, seems like they do not copy each other pattern, so having all three will be a plus, at first I assumed I might get 1-2 repeat design, sinceI had red angel too, but they actually are all different. Good purchase at the end, was happy with service and love my new plates. Would buy again if they release their #3. My next buy will be the XXL image plates, if I make some good money on holiday.</li>
    <li> There is nothing about these plates I didn&#x27;t like. I&#x27;m having fun with these.</li>
    <li> Great variety&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful storage&lt;br /&gt;Works with KONAD stamping kit&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use and clean</li>
    <li> Love these great verity. Great price!</li>
    <li> buena calidad y asi, llego a tiempo, llego lo que esperaba y todo muy bien ahora ya lo estoy usando y creo fue buena compra</li>
    <li> Es un excelente producto, lo recomiendo mucho y es exactamente como lo descrito por el vendedor, tambien el empaque fue adecuado y llegó en buenas condiciones, sin daños ni problemas</li>
    <li> As a beginner, I wanted something cheap (in case I didn&#x27;t get the hang of it) that also included a good variation.&lt;br /&gt;This was perfectly priced and had a lot of good stamps inside!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only negative I would say is that it didn&#x27;t include a stamper.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to use this product but some of the pattern&#x27;s aren&#x27;t engraved properly so the pattern won&#x27;t take.</li>
    <li> This set of plates is okay. Some of the stamps worked perfectly, while other were way to shallow for them to come off properly. If you have  long nails you will have to double stamp to get the full image on your nails. Enough of the images work to make this set a decent set to have.</li>
    <li> They are as the look like. very usefull. They were for a friend who has a nail center and she really like them</li>
    <li> The box was broken but the plates were in good condition. great product. recommend it.</li>
    <li> MY WIFE LOVED THIS SET BECAUSE IT HAS A LOT OF FLOWERY DESIGNS AND BEST OF ALL HELLO KITTY, ANGRYBIRDS, AND LITTLE ANIMAL CHARACTERS. IT HAS LIPS OF JUST ABOUT EVERY SIZE AND LOOK GREAT ON THE NAILS.</li>
    <li> I just started stamping my nails a couple months ago. I have image plates from Cheeky, Winstonia, Mash, Salon Designs, and these plates from Shany. These Shany plates are by far the worst of the bunch. They do not stamp well at all, if at all. I thought it was just me screwing up the stamping since I&#x27;m still new at it, but I&#x27;ve already done and redone my nails enough (usually twice a week) to know that it&#x27;s these plates, not me. I have no problems with the other image plate sets I have, except for these. Sad to say, but I will not buy any more image plates from Shany. The images aren&#x27;t stamped deep enough into the plate to hold enough polish to create the image. Was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Even though, I didn&#x27;t receive this product for over 2 weeks until I called amazon to notify them of what was going on, which they fix immediately, the product works great. At first, it was a little complicated to use, but then I got the hang of it.</li>
    <li> I brought this along whit SHANY 2012. I just love both. So many design to choose from. I would totally recommend this to anyone who likes nail designs but can&#x27;t do them. So much easier to use!!</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t used nail stamping plates before, but I looked up instructional videos on youtube, and it really isn&#x27;t all that difficult.  These plates work pretty well--I use the Konad white polish for stamping, but I&#x27;ve also had success with other polishes (Sally Hansen Insta-Dri).  Metallic polishes work pretty well, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Although this set technically comes with 25 plates, there is a &amp;#34;repeat&amp;#34; plate: S201--this fact is also visible on the product image.  I saw that before I purchased the set, but it didn&#x27;t deter me.  It&#x27;s just something I thought should be pointed out.  Still a great deal!</li>
    <li> All of the templates varied and were very cool.  My daughter loves them, and they are easy to do once you get the hang of it, but you will need a lot of nail polish remover to keep them clean.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to get this product. However when I opened it some of the plates where very scratched and some were even spotted with what appeared to be some black chemical. I like the designs and they do print very well but some don&#x27;t seem to have been printed  well because they are missing parts. Overall i guess it&#x27;s okay.</li>
    <li> love the stamps they work great and are at a great price</li>
    <li> Great! You get so many designs for a good price. Will buy more!</li>
    <li> I love my Shany 2013 Image plates. I could honestly say that they come in a better packaging then the 1st edition. I also like the fact that the side are not as sharp as the other ones. They do come with a blue adhesive covering which were very easy to take off.</li>
    <li> Very good service. If covered my expectations. I recommend the product, if it would buy again provider with a different product.</li>
    <li> There are many cute images in this bundle. I was very excited to use them. They transfer nicely.  Very pleased with this purchase</li>
    <li> Original order not received for some reason. Eventually they were re ordered and received. Very pleased with the quality for stamping.</li>
    <li> I just got my order today and I was so happy! Shany plates cost $12.95 and shipping and handling was $5.95 it took one day to ship and 4 transit days it came one day before expected. They were well packaged, it had air bubbles surrounding the plates in the box with plastic packaging holding the box of plates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had no missing plates with my set, I had set 2 of 2013 . The plates had a blue plastic film that was easy to remove. Also they stamp really we&#x27;ll with my konad double ended stamper and scraper set!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These plates come with designs for the holidays and an every day manicure!&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to someone who enjoys nail art and who can&#x27;t do nail art on their left hand which is easy to do!</li>
    <li> Just got these babies! Love them!</li>
    <li> FANTASTIC SELLER, quick ...........FABULOUS set of plates I wear these more often than most of my others, they have some very nice whole nail designs.</li>
    <li> Love these plates. Lots of images to chose from and the images came out clear with good detail.</li>
    <li> i liked this product but not all stamps worked smh</li>
    <li> I am by no means a nail art professional..but when I saw this product I just had to give it a try. I love that no two sets have the exact same paltes soyou can swap plates with a friend. Theres a great assortment of designs.. you get some holiday designs, chinese letters, animal prints, girly prints, very kool unconventional patterns like plaid and argyle. I use colour clob nail polish , ORLY OR CHINA GLAZE polishes as I have no shany nail polish n they work great! Essie for some reason does not adhere to the plates well so doesnt come off on the stamp pad . Keep in mind you need to order the stamp pad seperately.  Make sure and clean them off with acetone each to me to expand the lifetime of the plates. I absolutely love this product. Steps up ur nail art game 10 points!!</li>
    <li> I had ordered both the 2012 SHANY set and 2013 SHANY set. The 2012 set I received was right, had all 25 plates, undamaged. However, this 2013 set came in and after opening it, the plates were exactly the same as the 2012 set. Item # on both packages:SH-IMAGEPLATES-02, but both are the 2012 set. It WAS a Christmas gift, but I will be returning this set.</li>
    <li> Love the designs!!!  The plates are very thin so need to be a bit carefu but the etching is even - so far so good!</li>
    <li> Love it so many great designs there are some i dont use but thats about 2 of them they are great</li>
    <li> I bought these for my 13 year old to play around with. We first bought just the plates. Well, that didn&#x27;t work so we bought SPECIAL nail polish and the special Kovad stamping transfer tool. That didn&#x27;t work either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any YouTube videos or help sites I can go to???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANKS!</li>
    <li> The nail plates I ordered came in and they were just as I expected shany delivered as they would so I would recommend anyone who wants to order plates from them to do so</li>
    <li> I bought these for my girlfriend and she thinks they are great for the price and reasonably well made. These are good for all skill levels.</li>
    <li> They work perfectly, and they are really beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;Just like the description at the web site. I recommend them if you like nail art.</li>
    <li> I bought this plate set for its value and because it contained Hello Kitty image.  I am new to stamping.  I thought the images stamped fine.  There are several things I am unhappy about.  The picture shows plate sh210 having several Hello Kitty images on it.  I specifically wanted this because my daughters love her.  I was bummed when the set I received had stupid zodiac signs on it instead.  One plate was slightly scratched as well.  Again, the images stamped fine showing the detail I hoped for.</li>
    <li> Great bunch of designs.</li>
    <li> I received my plates today and there are scratches on them. I am having trouble finding anyone to contact regarding this. This was my first Shany purchase and is seriously making me doubt making any more purchases of Shany products.</li>
