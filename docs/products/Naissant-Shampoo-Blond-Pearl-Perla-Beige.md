<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have used quite a few purple shampoos. After reading all the positive reviews on this I wanted to give it a try. It is no where near as pigmented as some of my favorite previous toning shampoos.  I put a ton in my hair and let it sit and my hair still turned brassy. My next wash I went back to my old shampoo and the whiter/ashy color came back. As well the smell is not pleasant at all. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend. I love the Fudge violet toning shampoo (it takes quite a while to ship from the UK thats why i wanted to try something new). My next to try is the joico purple shampoo... Hopefully that will be a good alternative!</li>
    <li> As a platinum blonde I would stear clear...  my hair was whiter before I shampooed it&#x27;s almost like it deposited warmth. Maybe better for warmer blondes not for cool tones.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo. Definitely will order more.</li>
    <li> Love their shampoo and conditioner, removes warm brassy tones.. This product is s must for platinum hair. Doesn&#x27;t dry hair out, you need to buy this if you have platinum hair.</li>
    <li> It is everything they claim and then some !!! Best purple shampoo / conditioner everðŸ˜„</li>
    <li> The product came quickly and works as described.  I&#x27;ve never used a toner before, but this one definitely does the job!!!</li>
    <li> Great product. Works well. Smells good. Still damages hair due to formula but not as much as others ive tried. But then again toners arent generally good for your hair</li>
    <li> It takes many usages before you can actually start seeing a bit of a difference (maybe because I never left it on my hair more than 5 minutes). The color does not turn completely white-blond. I also noticed that the hair gets a bit damage after each use. Overall, I think that it will be easier to buy the stuff at a beauty store to get the desired hair color. However, I would recommend this shampoo for once in a while usage to keep the brassiness color less noticeable.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product!  When used along with the Naissant Treatment Blond Pearl - Perla Beige, my mousy brown roots lighten up enough to prolong touching up my roots.  Will continue to use on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> I hate it! My hair is almost white platinum and it turned my hair white and yellow parts! Total hate ðŸ˜¹</li>
    <li> It work ok couple spots made my hair Violet</li>
    <li> I think the size of the bottle is generous. The purple pigment is strong and you don&#x27;t need a lot. I always see a difference when I use this which is 1 - 2 times a week. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair,  but I do use a great conditioner after my shampoo also ( pureology hydra whip)  I also bought the Tone Correcting Mask by Perlabage but I think using both is redundant! I get great results with the shampoo only and the pigment seems more intense, so go with the shampoo if you are buying one. Also the smell is my favorite hair product smell. It reminds me of a resort spa I&#x27;ve been to in my past.</li>
    <li> Best toning shampoo I have found! A very nice smell, and much less expensive than Aveda. I have officially switched!</li>
    <li> Love it! It smells good and takes all the brass fron blond hair! Excellent product</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of this shampoo. It is the best toning shampoo I have used. Love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on the fence about this product...I enjoy the scent and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair which is great. I didn&#x27;t see the toning effect when I first bleached my hair so I bleached one more time and used this to wash it out, it seemed to work the 2nd time around, I will update my review once I give this product a fair shot because it could just be used error...:)</li>
    <li> Good purple shampoo. This shampoo is nice to use, it smells great &amp; brightens my blonde. I purchased the matching conditioner and use it after the shampoo. It does do what is says but I don&#x27;t really think there is anything special about it to justify the price. The previous purple shampoo that I have used prior does the same thing for less than half the price. I will finish the bottle but probably would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> This product is horrible! Im recently blonde from black hair so I deffinetly need a purple shampoo. I read a lot of reviews and they were mostly good. Some bad. Well I used this for 2 days as well as the treament. My hair fell out. Broke off. And felt like straw. It&#x27;s is horrible! I now have to repair my hair. It wasn&#x27;t damaged at all but now it is.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by a salon colorist. The way you get this (and other purple shampoos to work properly) is to first wet hair, take sliced lemons &amp; squeeze juice into hair (brassy areas). This prepares the hair to open up to receive &amp; &amp;#34;take&amp;#34; the shampoo properly. Read the directions &amp; leave it in for the amount of time indicated. If you have lots of brass you may leave it in a bit longer on those areas but be careful if you&#x27;re platinum blonde &amp; only have brassy roots. Use ot where you NEED it. If you don&#x27;t have a lot of brass or yellow you may not need as long. Also be aware that regular use of the product will create the best results. So even if you don&#x27;t see ALL of your brass go away the first time that doesn&#x27;t mean the product doesn&#x27;t work. My colorist (who is my relative &amp; wasn&#x27;t selling this item) recommended using this about twice a week. I was able to see results after the first use of this product using the lemon juice technique. I DO follow up with this same brand&#x27;s mask (which is recommended &amp; is also purple). My hair is NOT left with a purple tint of any kind. It has not stained towels or anything in my bathroom. My hair doesn&#x27;t feel damaged or brittle or dried out. It feels nice &amp; soft. No yucky smell either. Smells nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely continue to use this product! It is a bit pricey but I feel like it&#x27;s absolutely worth it! I have learned in matters of the hair... you get what you pay for. I have tried tons of purple shampoos &amp; this has been hands down THE BEST!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For reference: I have naturally light brown/dirty blonde hair. I keep it a medium or light ash blonde (I switch it up). In between colorings I do a few highlights AT HOME to stretch out how often I completely bleach/color. I feel like it&#x27;s better on my hair that way. I am Scottish/Irish descent so I naturally pull &amp;#34;golden&amp;#34; when I lighten my hair. I have red heads in my family. So when I use even light ash colors (I always use cool colors not warm) I still get a brassy or yellow tones. It will especially show a little while after coloring/bleaching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe this is a fantastic maintenance shampoo &amp; really fixes it! I actually washed my hair over the side of my tub &amp; looked in my bathroom mirror to apply the shampoo the first time to BE SURE I was hitting the brassy spots really good. I could literally see those tones change in a few minutes while looking in the mirror. I did not go over the amount of time in the directions on the bottle. I have no idea if this would work for other hair colors. I do know it works for blondes! I hope this helps!not warm) I still get a brassy or yellow tones. It will especially show a little while after coloring/bleaching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe this is a fantastic maintenance shampoo &amp; really fixes it!

    <li> didnt see much of any results..</li>
    <li> This stuff really works!  It&#x27;s by far the best &amp;#34;purple shampoo&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve ever tried!  Watch leaving it on too long or you WILL turn gray/violet!  I gave 4 stars just because I feel as if they would give you more but that&#x27;s my only complaint!</li>
    <li> Great Shampoo for toning my hair!</li>
    <li> Oh..I love it! My platinum hair stays platinum when I use it twice a week..I already bought another bottle!</li>
    <li> Best purple shampoo ever! Try it blondes!  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Horrible dull with gray tint blonde hair</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair soft and shiny, love it!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t tone and the smell is OVERWHELMING</li>
    <li> Very pleased turn my yellow blond to.a very pretty wheat blond.</li>
    <li> Great product for enhancing my blonde highlights</li>
    <li> Just used this for the first time today.  Seemed to brighten the hair which I loved and hair felt really clean</li>
    <li> I love the Naissant perla beige shampoo and conditioning treatment.  I use both 1-2 times per week.  I previously used Shimmer Lights and I&#x27;ve found this brand works a bit better and is not as drying to my hair.  Love this product!</li>
    <li> My natural hair color is a drab, dirty-blonde. Back in December, 2013, I decided to go red using a demi-permanent hair color (I used Ion Color Brilliance).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The demi-permanent was a lovely color, but by the time spring rolled around, I was ready to go back to blonde. I used a couple of boxes of a demi-permanent hair color remover and had okay success- the color blended enough to be tolerable. There was a reddish tint left behind but I didn&#x27;t feel it was worth damaging my hair trying to remove it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, the red ends recently started to bug me. I noticed that they are especially reddish in the sunlight. I bought this shampoo on a whim. And I am shocked. SHOCKED, by how how well it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions &amp; used 10 minutes of processing time. That residual red? Gone. I keep staring at it. I&#x27;ve lived with my reddish ends for over a  year, and all it took was one shampoo to clear it up. And bonus, I love the smell of this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair did feel dry afterwards, but 3 minutes of deep conditioning (Aussie&#x27;s 3 Minute Miracle- Smooth) has left my hair feeling great. I am delighted with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Best toning shampoo I ever tried.</li>
    <li> Best toning shampoo on the market and I&#x27;ve tried all the ones available in the U.S.  Control the intensity levels by the amount of time you leave the product in. Try the treatment too!</li>
