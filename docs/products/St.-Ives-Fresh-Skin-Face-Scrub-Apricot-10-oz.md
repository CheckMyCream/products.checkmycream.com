      <li>And SLS free which is a huge plus. Smells really good too.</li>
      <li>I attempted to rinse out my eyes some more to no avail.</li>

      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I love this face wash.  </li>
      <li>It was really calming and felt very nice on my skin.</li>

      <li>In the winter is helps with eliminating redness and making my skin look smooth and healthy.</li>

      <li>It didn&#x27;t really do much for me but made my skin smooth ...</li>
      <li>Compared to the other apricot scrub (whose &amp;#34;scrub particles&amp;#34; feel like ground up shells), this feels MUCH better and more like beads/sand.</li>
      <li>It is also great to use on patches of scaly skin that you&#x27;d commonly find on ankles, knees, elbows, etc.</li>
      <li>It didnt help much from getting rid my blackheads but it helps prevent them and this was the only thing that ever worked for the whiteheads on my nose feels smooth.</li>
      <li>The grains are much finer, and really get into your pores.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>But - this actually works pretty well on reducing the redness!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a redhead and my skin gets red easily with any irritation (for example when I have a zit the area stays red for weeks even after the zit has gone).</li>
      <li>Smell isn&#x27;t too strong, slightly minty.  </li>
      <li>and I love green tea!</li>
      <li>and he was able to squeeze me in for a last-minute appointment this morning and lo-and-behold, two tiny little scrub particles were lodged into the inside of my eyelid.</li>
      <li>It does clear blackheads, and gives your face</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>yes, yes it works, i&#x27;m only using this for 2 weeks now I exfoliating both face and whole body.</li>
      <li>And I was extremely surprised with the results.</li>
      <li>I asked my doctor if they would have come out naturally</li>
      <li>I used it for the first time this morning in the shower (eyes were closed when I used it).</li>
      <li>Ives has an older Apricot scrub that I used to use when I was young, and that was definitely not as high quality as this one.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s much cheaper, it was less than $3.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this face wash.  I could no longer find it in the local stores, so when I saw it on Amazon I ordered it!  I have sensitive skin and this actually does not irritate it. My face feels very smooth after using the wash.</li>
    <li> Please be careful using this! I used it for the first time this morning in the shower (eyes were closed when I used it). When I rinsed it off, it felt like there was something in my eye. I tried rinsing my eye with water and nothing helped. When I got out of the shower there were still little particles of scrub on my face even though I had vigorously tried rinsing all the product off in the shower. I attempted to rinse out my eyes some more to no avail. At this point I was feeling pretty desperate because I couldn&#x27;t blink without discomfort. I called my eye doctor and he was able to squeeze me in for a last-minute appointment this morning and lo-and-behold, two tiny little scrub particles were lodged into the inside of my eyelid. I asked my doctor if they would have come out naturally and he told me &amp;#34; There&#x27;s no way, they were too tiny and sharp. They would have just become more lodged into your eye. It&#x27;s good you came in so soon.&amp;#34; Welp, suffice to say I will NOT be using this product anymore and now I&#x27;m out $109 for the eye doctor bill. I have read reviews for the St. Ives Lemon &amp; Orange Scrub that have the same complaint of product getting stuck in people&#x27;s eyes... I see a trend here! Shame on you, St. Ives! I will be sending you a formal complaint shortly.</li>
    <li> I tried this scrub cause it was in the bathroom. My grandtwins use it all the time. I hesitated cause I have skin allergies but I had a few pimples on my face. I dabbed each pimple and did a couple of chores then washed my face. My skin felt clean and smooth. I didn&#x27;t have an allergic reaction so I started using it twice a day. Within the week those pimples were gone. If you have skin allergies just dab alittle on your pimple and wait to see if it hurts you. If all goes well then you will use this scrub forever cause I am.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I&#x27;ve been a fan of St. Ives for awhile, using their apricot scrub, but this is so much better! I&#x27;m a redhead and my skin gets red easily with any irritation (for example when I have a zit the area stays red for weeks even after the zit has gone). I used this and it really decreased the redness on my face. Plus, it smells absolutely amazing! It was really calming and felt very nice on my skin. I would highly recommend this product! But if you buy it at Target it&#x27;s much cheaper, it was less than $3.</li>
    <li> I love st Ives! So glad they use natural exfoliants since I heard the tiny plastic beads are terrible for environment. And SLS free which is a huge plus. Smells really good too. A lot cheaper in drug stores though.</li>
    <li> This stuff works better than most $100 skincare exfoliating products, including ones prescribed by my aesthetician. I originally bought it in a travel size just because I didn&#x27;t want the hassle of scooping out my fancy exfoliator into airplane bottles. And I was extremely surprised with the results. It does clear blackheads, and gives your face a beautiful, glowing smooth finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;St. Ives has an older Apricot scrub that I used to use when I was young, and that was definitely not as high quality as this one.

    <li> Works great!!  Doesn&#x27;t over dry skin !!!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t really do much for me but made my skin smooth ...blackheads &amp; acne was still there.... I need somethin more effective for the face.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel nice and soft! The &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t too gritty, and it&#x27;s not microbeads so no worries about killing fish.&lt;br /&gt;I also bought this as a mistake; I was looking for tea tree oil for my rosacea. But - this actually works pretty well on reducing the redness! So yay for that.</li>
    <li> Perfect for reducing oil production and clearing black heads</li>
    <li> yes, yes it works, i&#x27;m only using this for 2 weeks now I exfoliating both face and whole body. I can see a big difference. My blackheads are clearing out. I have back acne in my thigh and back.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best ever. One of my favorite beauty products - and my skin loves it so much that when I run out, I swear I start to see more blemishes!  LOVE THIS.</li>
    <li> I picked this out just because it says it&#x27;s a green tea scrub and I love green tea! Found out this product is better than the apricot scrub and it feels gentler yet much more effective! :)</li>
    <li> Came in 2 days. I love this product. I have redness from acne as a teen. In the winter is helps with eliminating redness and making my skin look smooth and healthy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good and it does what it suppose to but not as good</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought both this and the Blemish Control Green Tea scrub before. It&#x27;s pretty good for oily skin. The apricot scrubs always left me feeling so-so, but when I used this I wasn&#x27;t totally oily after my initial wash. Would buy again but it seems products like these aren&#x27;t popping up locally, so I might have to purchase this line online. Compared to the other apricot scrub (whose &amp;#34;scrub particles&amp;#34; feel like ground up shells), this feels MUCH better and more like beads/sand. Smell isn&#x27;t too strong, slightly minty.  Give it a try.</li>
    <li> Hard to find. Effectively reduces blemishes and pimples.</li>
    <li> It didnt help much from getting rid my blackheads but it helps prevent them and this was the only thing that ever worked for the whiteheads on my nose feels smooth. Love it ♥</li>
    <li> This thing cleared all my blackheads and I&#x27;ve only been using it for about 3 days. My only complaint is that it hasn&#x27;t had any major effect on my zits, but seeing as it isn&#x27;t a blemish scrub but is in fact a blackhead scrub, it is doing its job. Oh, and as for the person who got some in their eye, that has happened to me, too. When using this, KEEP AWAY FROM EYES. I mean, this is standard for a scrub anyway, but keep big circles around your eyes that have no scrub. I mean, there&#x27;s no need to scrub the soft, bags of your eyes or your eyelids anyway, so just keep it away from your eyes.</li>
