      <li>If it can help someone like my daughter, then it should be a fine option for many people with less severe skin conditions.</li>
      <li>Is exactly what I was wanting</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m pretty content with it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m using the hot wax for arthritis in my hands.</li>
      <li>First time using a paraffin wax bath at home.</li>
      <li>The order was delivered on a Hot Sunday afternoon.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ll never use any other kind of wax for my paraffin dipss again.</li>
      <li>I am 53 years young, and I have Arthritis in different parts of my body, so it is always nice to have a relief in some areas.</li>
      <li>No scent, and crumbled up enough to make usage easy.</li>
      <li>The scented to strong for me in the future</li>
      <li>Paraffin has been hard to find in the stores where I reside, so good &#x27;ol Amazon again.  </li>
      <li>They lather lotion on your limbs before dipping into the wax, but with this wax you don&#x27;t need the lotion and is almost too much with it.  </li>
      <li>Using the therabath really helps to rehydrate the skin.</li>
      <li>It also leaves a silky feel to the hands and the wax is very soothing.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very pampering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>All in all, a nightmare for this young</li>
      <li>I am not unsure if the wax is old or expired?</li>
      <li>paraffin wax for the professional</li>
      <li>and they helped soft in the bunions</li>
      <li>Just as described, easy to melt small pellets.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s tiny balls of wax stuck together when you first open the package, to make breaking the wax into smaller pieces, easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love this product my husband suffered from a traumatic brain injury leaving the right side of his body numb effecting his dexterity .</li>
      <li>We purchased this unit, which, for all intents and purposes, is the same as the professional unit used by her</li>
      <li>I got the scent-free wax and melted it in a small crock pot, let it cool and then dipped my hands in it.      </li>
      <li>The wax is sticky, does not leave your skin feeling smooth and it is hard to peel off!</li>

<li> and it&#x27;s such a help for dry and aching hands.</li>
<li> The beads had apparently heated up enough to make them stick together, but since the whole &#x27;ball of wax&#x27; (sorry) was going in my paraffin bath it didn&#x27;t matter to me.  </li>
<li> I had to purchase a paraffin bath due to a recent diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis and I can definitely tell a difference between the Therabath paraffin wax and other brands.  </li>
<li> The only downside is how much oil it leaves behind on your hands.</li>
<li> My bride suffers from arthritis and the deep heat helps tremendously.  </li>
<li> Curious to try another scent!</li>
<li> but they have no funny scents to deal with either.</li>
<li> and we put this stuff in the pot and melted down and stick my feet in there</li>
<li> If it had come in little separate granules then I would give it a 5 star review.</li>
<li> Plus I have Spinal Damage which left my right side of my body from the breast line down totally numb, BUT I don&#x27;t say any of this to have anyone feel sorry for me.  </li>
<li> I like the plain, but you can mix it with a scented wax also.</li>
<li> Not sure if it&#x27;s just me, but it takes quite a while for my hands to feel un-greasy.</li>

    <li> Arrived in good condition.</li>
    <li> The wax is presented as flakes rather than beads or a big lump. The flakes melt very quickly, so you do not need to wait three or four days to use wax therapy device. It also leaves a silky feel to the hands and the wax is very soothing.</li>
    <li> paraffin wax for the professional i use this product with my clients and they love it</li>
    <li> Best paraffin form ever, beads melt quickly and are so clean and smooth.  The unscented is not only great for allergic clients, but the perfect vehicle for me to add my own oils and scents for custom work. I&#x27;m sticking with this brand forever!</li>
    <li> Great value! I also really like the bead-like consistency that made refilling my parafin bath to just the right level so easy.</li>
    <li> Perfect for paraffin bath. No scent, and crumbled up enough to make usage easy. We dip our hands just about every day and it&#x27;s such a help for dry and aching hands. I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> I am 53 years young, and I have Arthritis in different parts of my body, so it is always nice to have a relief in some areas. The wax helps my hands and my wrists. I can&#x27;t use it on my feet because I have Raynauds syndrome, which changes the circulation and tempature of my feet and hands, but my feet are the worst of the two, and the left foot is the worst of all. Plus I have Spinal Damage which left my right side of my body from the breast line down totally numb, BUT I don&#x27;t say any of this to have anyone feel sorry for me.  I have had a relationship with the Lord Jesus since 1978, and He has been my strength and my BEST--EST friend, all the way through my life. So anything I go through He is with me all the way.              Thank You for the relief;                                  Your friend                                   Jill D. Mercier</li>
    <li> My daughter had a rare blood disorder that resulted in widespread scleraderma on her arm.  This causes hardening of the tissues, skin problems, and loss of function in her hand.  All in all, a nightmare for this young woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She was introduced to this therapy by her hand and arm physical therapist.  It helped her greatly, and they decided that daily therapy at home would be a huge benefit.  We purchased this unit, which, for all intents and purposes, is the same as the professional unit used by her therapists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have hope that systemic drug therapy will eventually reverse and even cure the scleraderma, but we think the wax treatments are essential to prevent further damage in the interim.  If it can help someone like my daughter, then it should be a fine option for many people with less severe skin conditions.</li>
    <li> This wax is amazing! :)</li>
    <li> This is the best deal going, especially if you are an Amazon Prime member and get free 2-day shipping like I am.  I shopped all over the place to find the best price for paraffin wax refills both online and in stores and this was by far the best priced per pound!  I will definitely be coming back for this item.</li>
    <li> The refills were received quickly and just as described!  They melt very nicely in my wax bath.</li>
    <li> great product,fast delivery A+++++++++++</li>
    <li> I have been paying a lot to have a paraffin wax treatment for my sore hands and I thought I would look on Amazon to see if I could find paraffin in bulk and try the process at home.  To my surprise the Therabath comes with mineral oil mixed in and is wonderful quality, melts easily, and cleans up easier than regular paraffin wax that I have used before.    I got the scent-free wax and melted it in a small crock pot, let it cool and then dipped my hands in it.      It is great for my sore joints and with the added oil, it acts as a moisturizer and my hands are soft and love the treatement!</li>
    <li> I had to purchase a paraffin bath due to a recent diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis and I can definitely tell a difference between the Therabath paraffin wax and other brands.  I haven&#x27;t found a brand that I like better!</li>
    <li> Paraffin has been hard to find in the stores where I reside, so good &#x27;ol Amazon again.  The beads had apparently heated up enough to make them stick together, but since the whole &#x27;ball of wax&#x27; (sorry) was going in my paraffin bath it didn&#x27;t matter to me.  Now I wish I&#x27;d gotten the scented wax; will do so next time.</li>
    <li> This product melts really well because of its texture.  It&#x27;s tiny balls of wax stuck together when you first open the package, to make breaking the wax into smaller pieces, easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind that this paraffin wax product has oils in it so it&#x27;s not quite like the wax at a nail salon.  They lather lotion on your limbs before dipping into the wax, but with this wax you don&#x27;t need the lotion and is almost too much with it.  I wish they offered non-oily wax like the salons so that I could use my favorite lotion before dipping but I&#x27;m not complaining.  Loving my hands and feet (skin &amp; cuticles) after a treatment.  It&#x27;s very pampering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side-note:  I purchased the scent free paraffin and signed up for the subscription because of the discounted pricing.  The prices always fluctuate like the stock market so the next batch I received was actually a few bucks less than my first subscription order.  I like how the subscription can be edited at ANY time to be delivered anywhere from one to six months, customized to a random delivery date in-between or even skipped altogether.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this is definitely quality paraffin and I&#x27;m pretty content with it.  Curious to try another scent!</li>
    <li> Easy to use, quick melting pellets, nice soft scent, I will buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Skin feels soft after use, and there is no odor to compete with other products and perfume.</li>
    <li> this stuff works great, I got them bunions on my toes and we put this stuff in the pot and melted down and stick my feet in there and they helped soft in the bunions</li>
    <li> Perfect Paraffin Wax refill for my Therabath Paraffin Bath.  The wax comes in beads, is infused with oil without the added scent which my husband would not appreciate.  It melts quickly and makes my husband&#x27;s hands feel relief from his arthritis. He also has cracking of the tissue on his fingers which is very painful and it helps.  I use it for arthritis in hands and feet.  .  The price is right and it is made in the USA.  We computed prices on much of the paraffin that is available and there was just a few cents difference.  The quality of this product has us &amp;#34;hooked&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I purchased this refill along with my warmer, I don&#x27;t reuse the wax so I wanted to have more on hand.  This is a nice soft wax, my hand &amp; nails have really benefited.</li>
    <li> Melts quickly. Has no untoward odor. Seems to moisturize the skin and leave a silky feel. Good for the body parts that fit !</li>
    <li> The wax is sticky, does not leave your skin feeling smooth and it is hard to peel off! I am not unsure if the wax is old or expired? I love my Therabath and the scent free paraffin wax pebbles that came with it (in the same packaging but purchased directly from therabath) was PERFECT. Same product but different seller. I am not sure what the problem is but I am disappointed. And now I am not sure how to return the product since the wax is all melted in my therabath but I do not even want to use it because it is so sticky and hard to peel off my hands.</li>
    <li> I bought these to go in my wax bath for my hands and they are great. They not only help my hands but they have no funny scents to deal with either.</li>
    <li> I love this wax and use it as refills for my wax machine. Just unwrap it and plop it in! I like the plain, but you can mix it with a scented wax also.</li>
    <li> Wax is great 6 pounds filled my unit perfectly.  I would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> I love that this wax comes in beads instead of a large block. 4 lbs works well in my Revlon wax bath. The wax is scent free and super easy to remove. The only downside is how much oil it leaves behind on your hands. Not sure if it&#x27;s just me, but it takes quite a while for my hands to feel un-greasy. Not that big of a deal. I will probably order this product again. Maybe even try a scented wax next time.</li>
    <li> I got bored using the Therabath every night to help with my healing broken wrist.  Got out of habit of using it when I started wearing my rings.</li>
    <li> I ordered 6 pounds of scent free and 6 lbs of lavender scent.  I mixed 5 scent free with one scented. The scented to strong for me in the future I&#x27;ll just order the scent free. The order was delivered on a Hot Sunday afternoon. &amp; sat in the sun all day while I was out the fair.  It all melted and clumped together.  Amazon said it would arrive on Sunday - I assumed it was wrong.  best to order in Fall winter or Spring if you don&#x27;t want it to melt into one clump. First time using a paraffin wax bath at home.</li>
    <li> My bride suffers from arthritis and the deep heat helps tremendously.  Also this time of year with the onset of cold weather dry hands can be miserable for both of us.  Using the therabath really helps to rehydrate the skin.</li>
    <li> This wax heats quickly and evenly. WOrks like a charm and I&#x27;ll never use any other kind of wax for my paraffin dipss again.</li>
    <li> I like the paraffin, but when it arrived it had melted all together. So unfortunately I had to melt it all at once. If it had come in little separate granules then I would give it a 5 star review.</li>
    <li> Very happy with purchase. Great seller!</li>
    <li> Love this product my husband suffered from a traumatic brain injury leaving the right side of his body numb effecting his dexterity . Dipping his hand in the hot paraffin wax loosens his tendons creating circulation - thank you for excellent service ! Great product for us!</li>
    <li> Comes in 1lb individual packages,  so we could add them as needed. Melted quickly and is fragrance free. We see somemail brown residue, but that has not interfered with regular use.</li>
    <li> order received and shipped promptly and meets all expectations</li>
    <li> Just as described, easy to melt small pellets.  As you break up the chunk, some might fly off somewhere which could be a hassle to clean up, so just be careful and do it as closely in the bath as possible.</li>
    <li> My order came within the week.  It works well, melting quickly in my paraffin wax bath from HotSpa! I&#x27;m using the hot wax for arthritis in my hands. This has been a very helpful product.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Best brand on the market!!  Strongly recommend this wax over other brands</li>
    <li> I get migraines so scented wax can sometimes be very strong. I buy one pound of scented and then add the rest in unscented wax. Works great, wonderful product! Look forward to buying again!</li>
    <li> Is exactly what I was wanting</li>
    <li> The wax has no smell and works great in my Therabath and is a great comfort to my sore foot</li>
