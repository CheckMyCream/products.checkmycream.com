      <li>This perfume has a soft elegant warm smell .</li>
      <li>It does have a very nice light citrus/spice scent, but it&#x27;s too light, and seems short lived for/on me.  </li>
      <li>Very light and pretty.</li>
      <li>Smells nice , but not particularly fond of it compared too some of the other Versace&#x27; products the Wife uses , but nice enough , and a great sample size , which makes ME BRILLIANT for trying out things on herüòÅ</li>
      <li>I love this cologne very much.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s part of the Alien line, and it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not too loud or overbearing but soft elegant fragrance that I just love!!  </li>
      <li>I like Yellow Diamond&#x27;s clean scent, and this beautiful little bottle is great for travel.</li>
      <li>If you like a light weight fresh scented frangrance than this is the one for you.</li>
      <li>I prefer the pink bottle better!:)</li>
      <li>Wears off on me fairly quickly</li>
      <li>I adore  Yellow Diamond I have had so many pepole ask me what I am wearing, I love it</li>
      <li>Its gives off a hint of light crisp air in the morning with a hint of lemons but a suttle sweetness that freshens the air.</li>
      <li>All gone, thank God hubby bought me a big bottle, favorite scent!</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t consider the Bright Crystal sweet, but Yellow Diamond goes down a bit of it&#x27; sweetness, with a bit more depth - but not musky.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m going to get the full size bottle very soon.</li>
      <li>it lingers on your body and clothes for a long time and it smells amazing.</li>
      <li>the bottle is little but its worth the price everyone ask what am I wearing because it smells so good</li>
      <li>It was funny to me.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>to get a bigger size for a better price, however i&#x27;ll give amazon another chance</li>
      <li>This scent is so clean and soft.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really like it very much.</li>
      <li>He was really moaning.</li>
      <li>But it was reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>It was ok but not what I had expected.</li>
      <li>so I wanted to test it out before I bought a whole bottle.  </li>
      <li>I like miniatures that way I collect them and try many different fragrances, I enjoy having many small perfumes before I buy bigger size</li>
      <li>It smelled amazing but the smell did not last long.</li>
      <li>Not this particular bottle.  </li>
      <li>but I can live with that.  </li>
      <li>Unexpectedly fab!</li>
      <li>I love Versace but it is too small for the price.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t have the same intense smell as the department store bottle that I was replacing.  </li>
      <li>It may be old?  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve heard of guys being turned on by different scents before, but this guy was really turned on.</li>
      <li>The scent really lasts a long time.  </li>
      <li>Although I love this fragrance, the small sample bottle does not seem to be as long lasting as the spray bottle.  </li>
      <li>Just yellow Diamonds to really make him work hard for a closness that he has been really trying to get closer too.</li>
      <li>I get about 2 seconds of citrus, a slight hint of pear, then it goes straight to woody/musky and stays there.</li>

<li> Keep him guessing but not for too long.</li>
<li> The perfume bottle was smaller than I expected</li>

<li> I would like to test the other products by this company.</li>
<li> The only complaint I have is that it is such a small bottle</li>
<li> Its so small, I thought it was at least a little bigger.</li>
<li> I bought it &#x27;blind&#x27; after reading reviews and descriptions on several sites, and really expected to like it.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s too small  </li>
<li> I find it to be quite an &#x27;ordinary&#x27; scent.</li>
<li> I would recommend this product in this size for anyone that is not sure they want to pay the price for the full-size version.  </li>
<li> Needless to say I smelled that scent all day long.  </li>
<li> The bottle is very small b.t.w. and doesnt have a spray bottle.</li>

    <li> Smells nice , but not particularly fond of it compared too some of the other Versace&#x27; products the Wife uses , but nice enough , and a great sample size , which makes ME BRILLIANT for trying out things on herüòÅ</li>
    <li> If you like a light weight fresh scented frangrance than this is the one for you. Its gives off a hint of light crisp air in the morning with a hint of lemons but a suttle sweetness that freshens the air. Wear this and you will not need any thing else. Just yellow Diamonds to really make him work hard for a closness that he has been really trying to get closer too. Keep him guessing but not for too long.</li>
    <li> Although I love this fragrance, the small sample bottle does not seem to be as long lasting as the spray bottle.  It&#x27;s a great inexpensive way to try a new Perfume.</li>
    <li> I was out and about one day and had on yellow diamond. This guy asked me what was I wearing and I told him. He said that the scent of it turned him on. We were in public and I can tell that the scent did something to him. He was really moaning. It was funny to me. I&#x27;ve heard of guys being turned on by different scents before, but this guy was really turned on. I hope he got this scent for his girlfriend....lol</li>
    <li> When I received the item it is almost 1/4 of the perfumed left .</li>
    <li> Its so small, I thought it was at least a little bigger. The smell is nice though!</li>
    <li> it lingers on your body and clothes for a long time and it smells amazing. The bottle is very small b.t.w. and doesnt have a spray bottle.</li>
    <li> I ordered this perfume and it arrived very quickly which was great!  The fragrance is awesome!!  It&#x27;s now 5:10 p.m. central time and I can still smell it on me after putting it on at about 6:00 a.m. this morning for work.  It&#x27;s not too loud or overbearing but soft elegant fragrance that I just love!!  The only complaint I have is that it is such a small bottle but I can live with that.  Just means I have to order more.</li>
    <li> This perfume is excelent, as same as it looks, smells delicious and you can use it the all day, the seller is good too, I received the product very quickly.</li>
    <li> This perfume Smell descent i would recommend the miniature version of Versace. This perfume has a soft elegant warm smell .</li>
    <li> I love Versace but it is too small for the price. I was assuming it was a bigger bottle of cologne.</li>
    <li> Unexpectedly fab! Very light and pretty. I&#x27;ve been wearing it quite a bit and like the way I feel in the scent.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too small  for the money&lt;br /&gt;Hope to get a bigger size for a better price, however i&#x27;ll give amazon another chance</li>
    <li> Perfect size to try to see if I liked it.  Love Amazon.  I use to buy a lot on Ebay, but my husband convinced me to buy only on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I had another Versace perfume on my wish list and ran across this one and thought I&#x27;d try this one. Sooooooo glad I picked this one, get compliments EVERY time I wear it and I&#x27;m going to get the full size bottle very soon.</li>
    <li> I like miniatures that way I collect them and try many different fragrances, I enjoy having many small perfumes before I buy bigger size, it was a good deal. this fragrance is fabulous</li>
    <li> It smelled amazing but the smell did not last long. Other than that I got lots of compliments. I&#x27;ll order again.</li>
    <li> This scent is so clean and soft. I love it! This little bottle was perfect to see if I liked it and I do!</li>
    <li> I got sprayed in the face at the mall with this scent...I dont think the sales lady did it on purpose though.  Needless to say I smelled that scent all day long.  When she sprayed me I wiped my face with my sleeve.  Later that day, I kept smelling this scent and I didnt know where it was coming from...It was my sleeve.  So I ordered it....I got It and I love it.  So now...I go to the mall to sample and come home and buy from amazon.  GO ME!</li>
    <li> I sampled this fragrance in stores and really liked it. My biggest mistake was choosing to buy it online.. it doesn&#x27;t smell nearly as strong as the one at the cosmetic counter AND the bottle is like an eyedropper it is so tiny!! This would barely last a normal wearer a week or two, definitely not worth the price.</li>
    <li> Glad I purchased this Have bought the 3.4 as well, smells nice.  Wears off on me fairly quickly but this mini is great to carry around to REFRESH!!!!</li>
    <li> the bottle is little but its worth the price everyone ask what am I wearing because it smells so good</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product in this size for anyone that is not sure they want to pay the price for the full-size version.  It&#x27;s a great trial size.</li>
    <li> I was appropiately priced for the size. I love the fragrance! Received my shipment in a timely manner. Would order again from the seller!! Thanks!</li>
    <li> It was ok but not what I had expected. I would like to test the other products by this company.</li>
    <li> SCRUMPTIOUS, SEXY, SWEET SMELLING.  Wish it were definitely a bigger size for the price paid.</li>
    <li> I adore  Yellow Diamond I have had so many pepole ask me what I am wearing, I love it I am going to purchase an entire set!&lt;br /&gt;I have folks stopping me asking me &amp;#34;Omg, what are you wearing&amp;#34;?  I have never had so may people wanting to smell me! LOL!&lt;br /&gt;Love it! Did I already say that ..... :0)</li>
    <li> I, personally prefer the Fresh/clean scents over the flowery, candy like, bubblegum, etc fragrances. When I came across Versace Yellow Diamond, I thought it was VERY nice!  I enjoyed my purchase and WILL restock  when I run out.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend you try it because I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Very nice, but not silage.  It does not have lasting power.  I have to drench myself in it just for others to notice it on me.  Too expensive to be doing that.</li>
    <li> This has a nice clean smell, not flowery or strong. I use it almost daily. I bought the small container for $12 to give it a try, but I don&#x27;t use that much each time so it will probably last several months.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Wish it were cheaper.</li>
    <li> I have the lotion that I bought in the store and it is terrific so I thought the perfume would be better.  Not this particular bottle.  It may be old?  It has lost it scent?  Is that possible?  Or it just never did have a stong scent.  I cannot smell it when I put it on let alone a few minutes later.  In order to  get any scent from it when on, I have to put on 1/2 a bottle.  And no others cannot smell it either.  It&#x27;s not just me.  Very poor product!  This product is expensive in the stores so I wanted to test it out before I bought a whole bottle.  I will not buy anymore of this product and would not recommend this small version in particular!</li>
    <li> The scent was a bit strong for me! I prefer the pink bottle better!:)</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this perfume. I get a lot of great comments on this fragrance. Its not over baring and I will purchase another bottle.</li>
    <li> the sent was a bit to floral for me. I didn&#x27;t really like it very much. But it was reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> Love the smell!  Have gotten so many compliments on it</li>
    <li> Awesome scent - love all the Versace scents.  The scent really lasts a long time.  I get a lot of compliments on this.</li>
    <li> The perfume bottle was smaller than I expected</li>
    <li> Scent lasts a minute. I will nvr buy another sample size. It is not the same as a dept. buy.</li>
    <li> Very nice scent - neither too sweet, nor too musky.  I have the Versace Bright Crystal, and love it, so decided to give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t consider the Bright Crystal sweet, but Yellow Diamond goes down a bit of it&#x27; sweetness, with a bit more depth - but not musky.  I like Yellow Diamond&#x27;s clean scent, and this beautiful little bottle is great for travel.</li>
    <li> Very sexy scent and most memorable</li>
    <li> I love this cologne very much. It smells fantastic. Would buy again. I do think I would buy a bigger bottle next time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought samples of this, and Versace&#x27;s Crystal Noir since I already own Bright Crystal.  I&#x27;m still on the fence over Yellow Diamond.  It does have a very nice light citrus/spice scent, but it&#x27;s too light, and seems short lived for/on me.  I purchased this in hopes of adding to my \\&quot;daytime wear\\&quot; during the warmer months, but I&#x27;ll stick with Bright Crystal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend Yellow Diamond for those who don&#x27;t care for overly floral/fruity/powdery scents.  If you want a citrus fragrance that&#x27;s a lil stronger, and has longer life, try a sample of Thierry Mugler&#x27;s Sunessence.  It&#x27;s part of the Alien line, and it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
    <li> Was not what I expected</li>
    <li> Great quality and unbeatable price, perfect to carry on at all times, can not go wrong with this brand. Unforgettable in any occasion.</li>
    <li> This was a disappointment. I bought it &#x27;blind&#x27; after reading reviews and descriptions on several sites, and really expected to like it. It was described as being citrusy/fruity, light, and airy. It may be all those things on someone else, but definitely not on me! I get about 2 seconds of citrus, a slight hint of pear, then it goes straight to woody/musky and stays there. It&#x27;s not horrible, but its something I&#x27;d only wear once in a great while, and I&#x27;ll probably try to swap it. I find it to be quite an &#x27;ordinary&#x27; scent.</li>
    <li> All gone, thank God hubby bought me a big bottle, favorite scent!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t have the same intense smell as the department store bottle that I was replacing.  Even though it saved me some money, I will go back to purchasing from the department store</li>
