<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t rotate as much as I would like</li>
    <li> Ummm.  Well, it&#x27;s a little difficult to get excited about an electric toothbrush head.  The heads are just like the one that came with my toothbursh and they fit fine.  Enough said?</li>
    <li> I got the products as described and fast delevery.</li>
    <li> This brush is a smaller head, stiffer brush and is for plaque control. I don&#x27;t believe this brush head is intended for daily use if you have senesitive gums. The standard brush head with &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; stiffness brush is the HX6013 and is actually less expensive as of this writing. If you require a ultra soft brush the look at the HX6053. Another important reminder, make sure your brush head are Phillips. There are a LOT of generics out now and most of them don&#x27;t meet the high standard of the brand name. There is a lot that goes in to this brush to make sure the end vibrates at the right frequency and intensity. The generic heads are a cheap plastic mold for the head and plain old nylon bristles. If you want the professional results, stay away from the cheap generics.</li>
    <li> They are working very well.  I have enough to &#x27;change out&#x27; every now and then.&lt;br /&gt;I needed them.  Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Julie</li>
    <li> AWESOME!!!!  EXCELLENT results!!!!</li>
    <li> begin split even after used first time... now i have used it less than 2 weeks, but it has split as a two month used HX6013..&lt;br /&gt;i won&#x27;t recommend this to any of my friend...</li>
    <li> Got these to supplement the toothbrush purchase. Dentist recommended an electric and it works great!  Philips makes quality electric brushes- we had one for over 5 years before it died, and replaced it with another one.</li>
    <li> Love these! they work great!</li>
    <li> Half the price as the same stuff sold in China. Good.</li>
    <li> Fit my sonicare healthy white toothbrus perfectly and these were the best price.</li>
    <li> The heads are much smaller than the standard heads that come with the Sonicare.  I don&#x27;t feel like they work as well as the larger bristle versions.  I stop using and have gone back to the original type.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with these toothbrush heads.</li>
    <li> I am glad these are the real stuff.  Got the &amp;#34;generic&amp;#34; brand before and it was a waste.</li>
    <li> Item as described, works fine.</li>
    <li> Perfectly used on 6730 A better price  is always expected ^_^</li>
    <li> People who say it&#x27;s firm are correct. Right up my alley. Use a soft touch and it cleans better than any other brush head.</li>
    <li> Great results using Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Very good For my toothbrush</li>
    <li> High-quality brand-name replacements for the Sonicare electric toothbrush.  I have not had any cavities since using this toothbrush.  The spinning head is not super-fast, so the wear and tear on sensitive gums is less pressure.</li>
    <li> On time and as advertised! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Great replacement product!!</li>
    <li> This appears to be exactly the same compact head that came with my Sonicare 2 Series at a MUCH cheaper price than the $15.00 each price at Target. Some people might find these brushes a bit soft but as they are they do an excellent gum massage.</li>
    <li> Very good, I like! Thank you amazon</li>
    <li> Came on time and is working well. Great product, great service.</li>
    <li> Makes regular brushing fun!  Easy to change and keep fresh!</li>
    <li> Not what I was expecting but that was probably my fault.  I needed a new head with the screw on doohickey and all this is, is the toothbrush  itself.  Amazon made it easy for me to return it which is why I buy almost everything from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Just as good as the previous model.</li>
    <li> Nice price. Good product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several varieties of genuine Sonicare heads and they have all worked excellently.</li>
    <li> Had been using the simply clean brush heads and figured that I would give these a try because they were $2 cheaper that day. These heads are smaller than the simply clean as the images above show. They are more sturdy than the simply clean which is a plus for me since I usually push hard. they mold well into the grooves between molars. They fit tight to my brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May seem weird, but only a 4 since I miss the little color ring on the bottom to differentiate mine from another user.</li>
    <li> I love it very much,and the shipping is good!</li>
    <li> I bought these replacement heads for my Philips Sonicare HX6731/02 HealthyWhite Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush that I purchased at Target.  The heads fit onto the base just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the brush head itself is smaller than the head that came on the HealthyWhite model, and I preferred the bristles on my old brush head to these.  But like I said, they attach just find to the toothbrush base; the bristles and brush head are just a personal preference.</li>
    <li> They fit my toothbrush and work great!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s quite soft and suited for me. Of course I like the discount.</li>
    <li> Great! The smaller heads are good for the kids, helps them get to their back teeth.</li>
    <li> Strong brushes...feel like im getting a cleaning from my dentist every time</li>
    <li> good quality, fit well</li>
    <li> After trying other replacement brushes that were said to be proper for my Sonicare system but proved to be too loud , I found these to work well and quietly. They are good replacement brushes.</li>
    <li> They are fine just  purchased for extras to have on hand.</li>
    <li> My teeth are definitely shinier and whiter with these.</li>
    <li> It dose a good job, although may feel a bit tough at first. I would recommend this to adults. But it could be too tough for a child.</li>
    <li> These brushes are okay, I guess, though I&#x27;d like a more gentle touch. Gentler is what I&#x27;ll look for next time, although this style would probably be fine for those wanting a real scrub-down.</li>
    <li> I was searching for compact brushes when I found these.... I assumed they were.  They are NOT---- and the description is not clear.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using an electric toothbrush for years and I think I like this one better than any I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> Just what I thought it would be PERFECT!!!!</li>
    <li> My friend think the item is well as she except!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these brush-heads for my sonicare!!  My dentist also likes them, LOL  Your teeth feel very clean and smooth after using this type.  The regular sonicare heads don&#x27;t fully remove the plaque from my gum-line, and I brush twice a day.  I even noticed they were removing stuff that only flossing could get, but that doesn&#x27;t mean don&#x27;t floss, LOL</li>
    <li> Highly satisfied and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Was worried they might be generic but they&#x27;re the real deal. Work great.</li>
    <li> Best price I have found for these expensive toothbrush heads, thank you again amazon!</li>
    <li> They brush my teeth well and fit the base of my Sonicare toothbrush perfectly. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about them is that they usually get clogged up with junk under the base all the time and they seem to wear out much faster than the original ones that were included with my initial purchase but this may just be something as simple as the stiffness of the bristles being different&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, as a buyer, I rely on other buyers’ reviews before making my purchases. I only hope this review was useful to you.</li>
    <li> Everything good. I had no problems.</li>
    <li> This set perfectly fitted my brush modeled 6921, and it seems to be true.</li>
    <li> Excellent replacement heads and EXACTLY what I was looking for at a better price than the local drug stores or Costco.</li>
    <li> Philips Sonicare HX9023/64 Pro Results Plaque...</li>
    <li> I had the regular brush head before and was kind of disappointed in the cleaning it gave me. I never felt that just out of the dentist clean. This brush head comes close to that. It&#x27;s obviously more firm than the regular head so if you&#x27;re going for something soft or gentle this is not it. If you want to cut down on plaque build up, go with this.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re great, they fit my Sonicare toothbrush properly. Haven&#x27;t been to my dentist yet to see if they truly decreased the plaque.</li>
    <li> These brushes are missing a rubber washer or something. This product sounds like a buzz saw in my mouth and wakes up our newborn. Can only endure it for about five seconds before I just turn off the toothbrush and confront the day with hairy teeth. I&#x27;m not sure what cut-rate, resale bootleg piece of garbage these people are selling, but if you don&#x27;t fancy the sound of a beehive going off in your skull when it&#x27;s toothbrushing time, stay away.</li>
    <li> Good but so expensive! I found sonimart ones that i like better and are cheaper. I usually hate generics but they are good quality</li>
    <li> These brushes well fit my Sonicaire and the price is right.</li>
    <li> Cleans really well.  I would recommend them over the other styles of brush heads for Sonicare.</li>
    <li> Was exactly what we expected</li>
    <li> Excellent!  I love them.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re toothbrush heads and work as they should...</li>
    <li> They are good and produce good cleaning results.</li>
    <li> Price was fair, product as advertised</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t believe these brush heads to be authentic. After comparing to seemingly identical brush heads from a local store it it pretty obvious these are fake.</li>
    <li> Excellent results.  Each head lasts approximately six weeks.</li>
    <li> used really good.&lt;br /&gt; It is convenient to use.&lt;br /&gt; A good product.&lt;br /&gt; Fast shipping thank me come.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my purchase . Thank You</li>
    <li> I happen  to like the smaller head on these, as compared to the regular heads on the other model of brushes.. It is a lot easier to get to the molars, which are the teeth the generally accumulate the most plaque. I do wish the colored rubber washers fit on these, so it was easier to differentiate my wife&#x27;s brush from mine from a distance (we also labeled our handles with our initials)</li>
    <li> Way too harsh on gums.  Much prefer the smaller softer head.  Easier to get around teeth.  Will not order again.</li>
    <li> Good for sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t decide if I like these or the original better, but that in itself is high praise.  I love having teeth that feel like I just left the hygienist.</li>
    <li> Seems a little less powerful than my previous one but still OK.</li>
    <li> Despite saying that these brushes fit “multiple Philips Sonicare toothbrush handles”.  The do NOT FIT the E SERIES.  I am returning them.</li>
    <li> These vibrate off of the pin within 15 - 20 seconds of use.</li>
    <li> I have the sonicare diamond clean toothbrush and bought there replacement brushes and they fit perfect.  I like them very much and feel they clean my teeth better than other kinds of brushes and are still less expensive than the dimond clean brush that originally came with my toothbrush.</li>
    <li> took awhile to find right brush for model but these fit OK</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the previous type of heads for my Sonicare (look more like regular tooth brushes) for years. A stock-out at Amazon pushed me to try these. Wow! The difference is amazing. I am a degenerate coffee drinker with brown stains between my teeth. These brush heads knocked out those stains within two to three brushings. My teeth just keep getting better looking as I continue to use these. They do a better job than my dental hygienist, plus I don&#x27;t have to listen to disgusting stories about what their nasty kids have done lately!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the lack of a compact head size version, but that&#x27;s my fault for having a small mouth.</li>
    <li> These work well but the heads are a bit small</li>
    <li> The price is a little expensive, can be a little cheaper. Things are very good, need to buy the next time.</li>
    <li> This is very good brush. Little too hard for my son, but it will keep his teeth clean. It&#x27;s better than the one came the the tooth brush.</li>
    <li> PHILPS electric toothbrush with fast and convenient, home essential!</li>
    <li> The price a little expensive, but something good！</li>
    <li> good price for good quanlity</li>
    <li> Great brush head! Really cleans your teeth!</li>
    <li> Keep my teeth clean and give me a happier and healthy smile.</li>
    <li> Just okay  . . .  will go back to regular brushes when these are used up.  Too hard.</li>
    <li> Great! And is not the same as Chinese PHILPS packaging</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare toothbrushes for about 10 years, and have been extremely pleased...until they came out with this head.  Judging from the positive reviews, there must be a lot of users who like it, but it is not for me.  I found the bristles on this new head much harder, and much less effective at removing plaque, than the bristles on the older model (HX6013).  I&#x27;ve always had a problem with plaque.  My gums usually bleed pretty badly when having my teeth cleaned.  A year or so ago, I started flossing regularly in addition to using the HX6013.  During the next two visits to the hygienist I had almost no bleeding.  When I bought replacements for the HX6013, this HX9023/64 was the only head available.  I&#x27;ve been using it for maybe three months, with no change in my flossing routine.  Last week, during my visit to the hygienist, the plaque was worse, and the bleeding had returned.  One minor complaint about this head is that the profile near the attachment point is different from the HX6013, so it doesn&#x27;t fit very well in the plastic travel case that came with my toothbrush.  If you have sensitive gums, you probably won&#x27;t like this head.</li>
    <li> I recommend this product.  Excellent teeth cleaning.</li>
    <li> These fit our Sonicare brush bases perfectly.  Good price, compared to what we found in stores.</li>
    <li> Very hard bristles and small head.  Good for tearing or pushing up your gums.</li>
    <li> Pricy but is an exact replacement of the brush heads that come with the original sonicare brush.  Love them! Wish they had more in a pack, instead of just 3.  If you are looking for an exact replacement head, this is the product to buy.</li>
    <li> We recently upgraded from the Sonicare E Series we have had for several years.  Well worth the money spent!  Gets your teeth exponentially cleaner than the E Series...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which gets your teeth exponentially cleaner than an old fashioned toothbrush!</li>
    <li> Excellent product -- EVERY ONE SHOULD BUY A SONICARE (and use it) !!!!</li>
    <li> buy this for the nice price.It&#x27;s softer than the diamond one.</li>
    <li> Very happy with it, highly recommended</li>
    <li> Had my first dentist appointment after using one of these brushes. My plaque was greatly reduced.</li>
    <li> I use these on my Sonicare Easy Clean. They work great. I wish they were a little longer.</li>
    <li> I am satisfied. very good</li>
    <li> Good things,you must take care of you teeth  :D</li>
    <li> Nice heads. Work great with my new brush. Soft but highly effective make my teeth feel great.</li>
    <li> Works perfect with Sonicare HX6211/30 2</li>
    <li> Good price and fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Looking forward to good news at next hygenist appointment. Teeth feel just as clean as after a checkup. Great product.</li>
    <li> straight forward. I own the sonicare electric toothbrush. This is something I didn&#x27;t want to get generic, so I ordered more. Just like what you would buy from the store.</li>
    <li> excellent replace heads</li>
    <li> Some of those brush heads won&#x27;t even attach to the Philips teeth brush! It will fall down after you turn on the motor.</li>
    <li> Recommended by the dental hygienist. The battery doesn&#x27;t have to be recharged for more than a month. Waiting to get a clean bill of health next time I see the dentist.</li>
    <li> I love these heads. I have a small mouth for an adult (my dentist always complains), so when these arrived I compared them to my two heads that came with my base- a compact and a standard. These are a happy medium between the two. The bristles also feel more like the bristles of the spinny polishing tool the dentist uses, which I prefer over the regular bristles of other heads. I&#x27;d recommend these to anyone who has trouble getting their brush back behind their molars who appreciates nice, smooth, fresh from the dentist teeth. :-)</li>
    <li> I love this product and have it on subscription order.</li>
    <li> This is a great improvement to the other brushes I used for my Sonicare.  They are more substantial and seem to do a more thorough job of cleaning my teeth.</li>
    <li> SCAM - you get a tiny brush head although the advert makes them look large-med-small. What a joke.</li>
    <li> Best check up / teeth cleaning ever since I started using this tooth brush.</li>
    <li> Replaced my old HX6023/30 with these new ones, and they are a better version.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed in significantly smaller size of brush head, even though it is noted as Standard.  Felt ripped off and have been a great Sonicare user and supporter.  Check the brush size at store before switching to the Plaque Control.</li>
    <li> I was brushing too hard and causing myself gum abrasion problems. I bought the Sonicare  and have always used the normal brush heads.  Works great!  Honestly,  I bought these because the price was cheaper and don&#x27;t like them.  They are a much harder brush and don&#x27;t feel good against the gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only used one and have already ordered the regular brush heads with a much softer head.</li>
    <li> as  reviewed -worked on  body of unit</li>
    <li> good!!&lt;br /&gt;There is no fake.&lt;br /&gt; It is the real thing.</li>
    <li> Very reasonable price and exact fit for my Pro Results brush.  The new head style seems to do a little better job too.</li>
    <li> Wonderful medium sized head</li>
    <li> works perfectly with my toothbrush -GREAT PRICE!</li>
    <li> I love this brand of brush heads.  I&#x27;ve tried the generic and it doesn&#x27;t compare.  I would definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> Fine ............Most of the Sonicare products I have experienced are very good.</li>
    <li> Brushes much harder than I am used to.  Will not order these again.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my husband.  He has had sonicare in past.  He loves having product again.  Only comment he made is it was &amp;#34;louder&amp;#34; than last one he owned!</li>
    <li> Excellent. Fast service and great price.</li>
    <li> bought at a good price, and haven&#x27;t used it yet.</li>
    <li> Works and looks as described.</li>
    <li> good value, perfect fit, life span about the same, these seem a little denser packed and teeth feel cleaner.</li>
    <li> smaller than the original but still great</li>
    <li> fit hX6730.The brush is smaller,so it can clean the deeper place in mouth.</li>
    <li> These brush heads are hard as rock.  They do not massage the gum like the soft brush heads.  My mouth feels cleaner with the soft brush heads.  I will definitely avoid these plaque control brush heads in the future.</li>
    <li> I like them.  They work well with my Philips Sonicare.</li>
    <li> The brushes met my expectations.  Have had better results at the dentist since have been using., so that is great!</li>
    <li> A few months ago I switched to a Sonicare toothbrush and started using 3M PerioMed, and my teeth and gums are now in much better condition.  I don&#x27;t know how much of the credit to give to the toothbrush and how much to give to the PerioMed, but there is enough to go around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first started using my Sonicare these caused my gums to bleed a bit.  I bought a package of the Pro Results Gum Health heads and after I used them up I switched back to these and I haven&#x27;t had any problems since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I (briefly) tried some generic heads so I can say with confidence that these are *well* worth the extra money.  Not only do these do a *much* better job, but they also last a long time, which really helps make up for the difference in price between these and the generic knock-offs.</li>
    <li> these are great, nice size and best of all they snap on and don&#x27;t come off.</li>
    <li> Just what they were supposed to be.</li>
    <li> works. arrived as described.</li>
    <li> Very cost-effective, delivered quickly.</li>
    <li> Previously, I have used Philips Sonicare Series e systems and have been disappointed that the on/off switch fails after a couple of years.&lt;br /&gt;The new series 2 does not fit together well, is noisy and does not seem to clean as well.  It is cheaper but the brushes seem very expensive for what you get.  I intend to go back to the Series E, if they are still available or switch to a different brand.</li>
    <li> Works great. The actual brush length is a little smaller than the regular. Otherwise I would give it a 5.</li>
    <li> Surprised at how well this system works. Compared to the Braun which I have used for 25 years, Sonicare heads barely move.  Yet they clean, probably better than the Braun does.  It is tough to find these at a discount.  This is where the money is made at folks.  They could almost give away the electric toothbrush.</li>
    <li> My eyes are so sensitive. I HATED putting on mascara!!!!!!!!! I looked forward to the weekend when I didn&#x27;t need to wear it! Now that I have been wearing this, my eyes RARELY get irritated. It&#x27;s awesome. Like the other reviews, be forewarned, it does not dry like normal mascaras.</li>
    <li> I like these cause they are bigger than the heads I previously had.</li>
    <li> Great product, good price, fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush. Definitely helps reduce plaque.</li>
    <li> Excellent, no problems.</li>
    <li> Simple and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Brush worked very well...better than the regular pro results.  However, one of the brushes was defective.  When I contacted the seller, they responded quickly and offered me a refund for the one defective brush.</li>
    <li> Things good 6215 can be used</li>
    <li> These are great! I&#x27;ve used a Sonicare for 17 years, and I&#x27;ve always been happy with their products.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a smaller head than the previous version but I actually like this version more. Better for me.</li>
    <li> The heads I received are clearly knock offs. Do not order these.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really liking the new style.  They definitely feel more firm than the previous version.  My teeth feel nice and smooth after each brushing.</li>
    <li> I am a boy from China ,this is very good</li>
    <li> Great replacement brushes</li>
    <li> These are the new improved replacement brushes for the Sonicare and they work great!</li>
    <li> I like these better than the ones that came with the toothbrush since I&#x27;ll know when to replace them.  I was also happy to see that they include the plastic head cover.</li>
    <li> WISHED THEY MADE A LARGER BRUSH HEAD....SURE HATE TO SEE THE SPECIALTY HEADS</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t fit perfectly but they come the closest to what I need for my discontinued Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
    <li> These fit my electric toothbrush, and are of good quality</li>
    <li> Not these are pretty decent, bristles do not fall out and they are also very stiff to start.  I like that they are small and very maneuverable.</li>
