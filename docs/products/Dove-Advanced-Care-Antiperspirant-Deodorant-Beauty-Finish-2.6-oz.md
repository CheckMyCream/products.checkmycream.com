<ol>
      <li>Happily the answer is yes.  </li>
      <li>This is a great protector, though, as I wore it while playing tennis</li>
      <li>, Dove does a great job with scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>so it makes it a good buy.</li>
      <li>It smells really good.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been applying this stuff 3 times a day, and to be honest, it doesn&#x27;t seem to mask any odors or anything.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It smells nice, even when it starts to wear off.</li>
      <li>Finally, it is entirely effective as both a deodorant and an antiperspirant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dove</li>
      <li>I have to admit, even on a summer day, it held its own.</li>
      <li>This deodorant feels nice when you apply -</li>
      <li>The deodorant smells nicely, and seem to work ok.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Dove for years, and I love it.</li>
      <li>Usually I love dove products</li>
      <li>This deodorant provided much better protection against both wetness and odor</li>
      <li>I like the way this product smells, and it feels nice and smooth going on.</li>
      <li>I know there are people out there that love this type of rollon, but since I often like to go sleeveless, I prefer a product that you can not see if you raise your arms.</li>
      <li>love Dove in our household</li>
      <li>The deodorant is smooth and creamy, and goes on nicely.</li>
      <li>I have tried many deodorants and I would have to say, this is one of the better ones in the market.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a nice light scent.</li>
      <li>Dove makes my favorite deodorants</li>
      <li>I have used many different Dove deodorants and been mostly impressed with them.</li>
      <li>I have been using Dove products for many years and they are a trusted brand in our house.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m thinking 24 hours is pretty good.</li>
      <li>It has a nice, light clean smelling scent.</li>
      <li>kept me feeling fresh and smelling good for a full 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The soft texture is also a great plus.</li>
      <li>Has a nice, fresh smell but isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
      <li>However, I will say that this Dove deodorant did apply easily, is beautifully designed and as I mentioned earlier has an amazing fresh scent.</li>
      <li>and this deodorant has made life more pleasant (and those around me are likely pleased as well).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s so easy to apply.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s not too strong.  </li>
      <li>It has a very very light scent, you have to be super close to smell it.</li>
      <li>I  love the light, clean smell.</li>
      <li>The scent is fresh and clean, just as claimed, and it seems to be effective even in our summer weather.  </li>
      <li>It glides on my skin smoothly and doesn&#x27;t leave any residues.</li>
      <li>The advanced care  formula worked for me.</li>
      <li>and I hadn&#x27;t yet tried the Advanced Care line.</li>
      <li>Many deodorants have a certain smell to them that I dislike, but Dove manages to smell very clean.</li>
      <li>Although I love the clean, fresh fragrance, I am not a fan of the residue or film that this product leaves on you after you apply it.</li>
      <li>I was excited to try this one - the Advanced Care</li>
      <li>This Advanced Care Original Care appears to be another winner.</li>
      <li>the scent of this deodorant is just what the container says: clean.</li>
      <li>The Advance Care Original Clean Dove Deodorant goes on clean and smooth - fresh smelling, nothing overpowering here.</li>
      <li>It’s not overly flowery or woodsy or sweet, just clean.</li>
      <li>because I love it so much</li>
      <li>This is my absolute favorite scent of all the Dove deodorants and I like that</li>
      <li>Good solid deodorant. .</li>
      <li>However, that scent seemed to dissipate pretty quickly and simply left a good, clean, light fragrance.</li>
      <li>Yes this product makes your underarm area smooth but who cares about that when it does absolutely nothing for b. o</li>
      <li>I pull off the cap and bring it up to my nose and sniff, as if smelling a freshly picked flower.</li>
      <li>and the smell is fresh and not over-powering</li>
      <li>like fresh and void of any over-powering girl-y scent.</li>
      <li>it gave off a light fresh smell that was very refreshing.&lt;br</li>
      <li>just so that I can smell fresh and not stinky from the heat.  </li>
      <li>The price at the time of this review is also quite economical compared to all but the cheapest deodorants.</li>
      <li>Years ago I really loved Secret deodorant but more and more through the years, I really prefer Dove.</li>
      <li>The original clean sent is nice but slightly stronger than I&#x27;d prefer.  </li>
      <li>Other than that, a good choice.</li>
      <li>No irritation even right after shaving.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I can catch a tiny whiff of this clean fresh fragrance throughout the day when I am stressed or outside in the 100 degree heat of my beloved state of Texas.</li>
      <li>The new, curved deodorant container is comfortable to hold and use.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s hot and sticky right now,</li>
      <li>I also haven&#x27;t noticed any white marks left on my clothing which is great.  </li>
      <li>did a great job of keeping me dry and odor free but didn’t dry or irritate my skin like some deodorant.</li>
      <li>Not a particularly strong or remarkable scent.</li>
      <li>It works better on me that Suave but not as good as Secret</li>
      <li>Overall, It performs as great as the regular Dove deodorants that I have used.</li>
      <li>The price is very reasonable.</li>
      <li>and I really missed how Dove glides on and moisturized my skin while protecting me from sweating!</li>
      <li>So far no annoying clothing stains.  </li>
      <li>Thanks Dove, you added another winner to the team!</li>
      <li>It also keeps skin from &#x27;sticking&#x27; when you get hot and sticky.</li>
      <li>Lately, I&#x27;ve been using the Go Fresh line, and although not as good as the Go Sleeveless....</li>
      <li>But the fragrance will win you over especially if you don&#x27;t like the baby powder scents of some other brands of deodorants.</li>
      <li>Now, I like how easily this applies for a solid and</li>
      <li>The one thing I really don&#x27;t like is the shape of the container.  </li>
      <li>I like the curved container, very comfy to use.</li>
      <li>it does absolutely nothing for</li>
      <li>Could this really hold up in a Phoenix summer?  </li>
      <li>When it comes to deodorant, I am very picky.</li>
      <li>Works really well</li>
      <li>She really likes it.  </li>
      <li>I was surprised to find that on a day that I took a late shower, my underarms were still fresh and dry 36 hours later, which is quite impressive.</li>
      <li>I like the mild fresh, clean scent that is subtle and unobtrusive.</li>
      <li>; to make them soft and smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on my shirts.</li>
      <li>and I found the mild scent pleasing enough.</li>
      <li>My first impression was that the scent is a little strong.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s got a clean scent that isn&#x27;t overwhelming to my poor allergy-infested nose and sinuses.  </li>
      <li>deodorants are gentle on my sensitive skin and always perform well.</li>
      <li>I normally use either the Dove Clinical Protection or the Degree Clinical Protection deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I will go back to my Go Fresh deodorant.</li>
      <li>I like the Dove deodorant not only because it helps keep you fresh but also for the moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>I prefer that, especially at work, because I do not know how who may have certain scent allergies, and I prefer a deodorant not to intermix with whatever perfume I may be wearing on certain day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I did feel fresh and clean when I was done (just as well if not better than any gel deodorant I may use.</li>
      <li>live in South Florida</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s very soft and creamy....</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>Dove doesn&#x27;t last any longer or work any better than other deodorants, but the texture and smell are the factors that always keep me buying it.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t too sure about this deodorant because I usually use the &amp;#34;clinical protection&amp;#34;</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;It smells nice, even when it starts to wear off. It is fresh and a little flowery without being overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;Made in the USA.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t need to use a lot.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;It does clump a little, so I don&#x27;t recommend wearing black.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is awful awful awful.</li>
    <li> My wife and I debated about who should test this product.  We concluded that if it were intended for men it would be packaged in grey but not white, so she has been using it.  She really likes it.  Does not sting after shaving.  So far no annoying clothing stains.  Not a particularly strong or remarkable scent.</li>
    <li> Everybody has different body chemistry and therefore reacts differently to personal hygiene products. I have to say that I&#x27;m surprised by the reviews that say this smells bad and is ineffective against body odor. I had been using a weak deodorant that was failing me (and I&#x27;m not all that sweaty) in the California summer temperatures and I switched to this. This deodorant provided much better protection against both wetness and odor and I found the mild scent pleasing enough. The scent does come across as a bit &amp;#34;old school,&amp;#34; as it was reminiscent of the old moisturizers that my mother used to get form Avon in the 1970&#x27;s. It&#x27;s not bad at all, just not strong or distinctive. The price at the time of this review is also quite economical compared to all but the cheapest deodorants. This is a powder stick, so it goes on a little dry, but has a bit of creaminess to it. It also keeps skin from &#x27;sticking&#x27; when you get hot and sticky. This worked well for me.</li>
    <li> Our family uses Dove products a lot from deodorant to skin care lotion and I don&#x27;t think I got a bad one in the bunch and this one does not disappoint. I have very sensitive skin so sometimes I have to use women&#x27;s products because they are not as harsh especially underarm sprays or roll-ons. This one kept my sweat at a minimum and when I did perspire more than usual it gave off a light fresh smell that was very refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We love Dove in our household and this product is a thumbs up!</li>
    <li> I like this deodorant quite well.  The scent is fresh and clean, just as claimed, and it seems to be effective even in our summer weather.  The one thing I really don&#x27;t like is the shape of the container.  It fits the hand well, but being skinny in the middle makes it top-heavy and it often tips over when I set it down sink-side.  A small matter, for sure, but I&#x27;m afraid it will eventually cause the product to break and crumble out of the container.  Other than that, a good choice.</li>
    <li> Works really well and the smell is fresh and not over-powering</li>
    <li> Good solid deodorant. . The advanced care  formula worked for me. The original clean sent is nice but slightly stronger than I&#x27;d prefer.  Moderately priced under Amazon&#x27;s add on program</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Dove for years, and I love it. It glides on smoothly - no clumps. Has a nice, fresh smell but isn&#x27;t overpowering. I have several sticks of this deodorant in various places (one in my car, one in my travel bag, one at home) because I love it so much and it&#x27;s so easy to apply.</li>
    <li> I like the way this product smells, and it feels nice and smooth going on. It doesn&#x27;t leave white gunk everywhere, which is a plus. No irritation even right after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hot and sticky right now, and this is keeping it all under control for about 24 hours, not the 48 it advertises. But it&#x27;s pretty hard to control sweating when the heat index is over 100, so I&#x27;m thinking 24 hours is pretty good.</li>
    <li> The deodorant smells nicely, and seem to work ok. I did not try to go shower-free for 48 hours, and I doubt it will keep me fresh for that long, but it seems to be fine for regular everyday use. The deodorant is smooth and creamy, and goes on nicely. It does not irritate my skin there at all.&lt;br /&gt;My only thing that bothers me about Dove deodorants is they break if you drop them, not the plastic, but the deodorant stick itself, it falls out of the holder, and even though I can push it back in, it does not stay there and keeps falling off, so I end up throwing away the whole thing when there is a lot of product left. I am not sure how they could have fixed this issue, though. It might work better for you if you are not as clumsy as I am and do not drop stuff on regular basis.</li>
    <li> Yes this product makes your underarm area smooth but who cares about that when it does absolutely nothing for b. o also I noticed it did nothing to reduce sweating. Will not purchase again. Usually I love dove products</li>
    <li> I thought this would be odorless but it was not! I was still sweating and the smell was unpleasant. Never again.</li>
    <li> Dove makes my favorite deodorants and I hadn&#x27;t yet tried the Advanced Care line. Given my propensity to sweat, even in the winter and without exercise, I wasn&#x27;t expecting this, or any, product to keep me dry for 48 hours. Since I shower every morning, I do not need my deodorant to last this long. I was surprised to find that on a day that I took a late shower, my underarms were still fresh and dry 36 hours later, which is quite impressive. My only reason to knock down a star was for the &amp;#34;Clean&amp;#34; scent. It is a personal preference but I did not love the floral scent of this one.</li>
    <li> I love Dove deodorant and have used it exclusively for the past several years. I  love the light, clean smell. Many deodorants have a certain smell to them that I dislike, but Dove manages to smell very clean. The soft texture is also a great plus. Dove doesn&#x27;t last any longer or work any better than other deodorants, but the texture and smell are the factors that always keep me buying it.</li>
    <li> happen to use Dove deodorant on a regular basis.  My favorite was the Go Sleeveless ones - which are next to impossible to find these days.  Lately, I&#x27;ve been using the Go Fresh line, and although not as good as the Go Sleeveless.... it works well for me.  I was excited to try this one - the Advanced Care and I gotta say - it does absolutely nothing for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in South Florida - so it gets hot and humid down here.  And I sweat a LOT in the summer.  This deodorant feels nice when you apply - it&#x27;s very soft and creamy.... but it leaves a ton of residue and after about an hour or so, it doesn&#x27;t feel like there&#x27;s anything left (aside from that residue).  I&#x27;ve been applying this stuff 3 times a day, and to be honest, it doesn&#x27;t seem to mask any odors or anything.  Not a fan.  I will go back to my Go Fresh deodorant.</li>
    <li> I like the Dove deodorant not only because it helps keep you fresh but also for the moisturizer.  It works better on me that Suave but not as good as Secret but I like to switch around so that my skin doesn&#x27;t get used to one product and then I&#x27;m stuck when they discontinue it.  The fragrance smells a bit like floral scents but it&#x27;s not too strong.  I have been using this after I leave the beach at the ocean since I have almost a two hour drive home just so that I can smell fresh and not stinky from the heat.  Has been working like a charm for me here.</li>
    <li> Rating this as 4 stars. Although I love the clean, fresh fragrance, I am not a fan of the residue or film that this product leaves on you after you apply it. For that very reason, I usually steer clear of anything but gels for my daily use. However, I will say that this Dove deodorant did apply easily, is beautifully designed and as I mentioned earlier has an amazing fresh scent. I know there are people out there that love this type of rollon, but since I often like to go sleeveless, I prefer a product that you can not see if you raise your arms. This is a great protector, though, as I wore it while playing tennis and I did feel fresh and clean when I was done (just as well if not better than any gel deodorant I may use.</li>
    <li> The first thing I do when trying a new deodorant isn’t to check its ingredients, or research how long it last, or even consider the cost, the first thing I do is…smell it.  I pull off the cap and bring it up to my nose and sniff, as if smelling a freshly picked flower. Does everyone do that – or is it just me?&lt;br /&gt;Well the scent of this deodorant is just what the container says: clean. I like the smell. It’s not overly flowery or woodsy or sweet, just clean. And not clean like Lysol….clean like fresh and void of any over-powering girl-y scent. Nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This went on smoothly and covered my armpits with a thin layer of moisturized deodorant, no big clumps and left nothing on my clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I had no reason to test it for 48 hours….it kept me feeling fresh and smelling good for a full 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> My first impression was that the scent is a little strong. It has a soapy-clean sort of fragrance that I was initially not certain I would like. However, that scent seemed to dissipate pretty quickly and simply left a good, clean, light fragrance. Now, I like how easily this applies for a solid and I also like how it does not creep through my black t-shirts (but it will still leave white marks inside, of course). Finally, it is entirely effective as both a deodorant and an antiperspirant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dove deodorants are gentle on my sensitive skin and always perform well. It is a product I trust and use! Recommended!</li>
    <li> I have tried many deodorants and I would have to say, this is one of the better ones in the market. I read the other reviews that said this deodorant was ineffective for them, but this was not the case for me. It has a very very light scent, you have to be super close to smell it. I prefer that, especially at work, because I do not know how who may have certain scent allergies, and I prefer a deodorant not to intermix with whatever perfume I may be wearing on certain day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This leaves no marks on clothes! Office clothes are a pain in the butt, and the worse thing is a white mark on a black blouse, but this goes on almost clear, and it is absorbed in your skin quickly. I sweat like a pig sometimes, and this keeps me covered, especially when I compare it to days were I forget to wear deodorant, and by the end of the day, my clothes around my armpits are stinky and wet. This is deodorant is also economical compare to other deodorants so it makes it a good buy.</li>
    <li> Years ago I really loved Secret deodorant but more and more through the years, I really prefer Dove. I like the texture, the scent, the effectiveness, and it’s moisturizing and doesn’t dry or irritate my underarms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a nice light scent. It smells really good. I like the scents of Dove deodorants, Dove does a great job with scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on invisible. I didn’t get those annoying white marks on my clothing except on really dark clothing like purple or black and only if I hadn’t let the deodorant “set” for a minute first before dressing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did a great job of keeping me dry and odor free but didn’t dry or irritate my skin like some deodorant.</li>
    <li> I have been using Dove products for many years and they are a trusted brand in our house.  When it comes to deodorant, I am very picky. Let&#x27;s face it, it&#x27;s not something we want to have an epic fail with when we try a new product!  I was hesitant. I normally use either the Dove Clinical Protection or the Degree Clinical Protection deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The Advance Care Original Clean Dove Deodorant goes on clean and smooth - fresh smelling, nothing overpowering here. That&#x27;s what I want. I don&#x27;t want a fragrance to mask a smell! I don&#x27;t want a smell to begin with!  I put the Advance Care to the test!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I have to admit, even on a summer day, it held its own. The only thing that I miss between this and the advance care is the application aspect. I miss the tiny holes that help break up the solid so that it goes on smoother. (See pics below for the comparison to show you what I mean)  Other than that, this won for price point, getting the job done and overall value!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Thanks Dove, you added another winner to the team!</li>
    <li> I have used many different Dove deodorants and been mostly impressed with them. This Advanced Care Original Care appears to be another winner. I like the mild fresh, clean scent that is subtle and unobtrusive. The new, curved deodorant container is comfortable to hold and use. It glides on my skin smoothly and doesn&#x27;t leave any residues. It works very well to keep my armpits dry all the times, and doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes. It also seems to last for a long time as I don&#x27;t find myself reapplying it often. Overall, It performs as great as the regular Dove deodorants that I have used. I like the curved container, very comfy to use. The price is very reasonable. What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t too sure about this deodorant because I usually use the &amp;#34;clinical protection&amp;#34; ones that have 20% of the active ingredient Aluminium Zirconium Tetrachlorohydrex GLY while this one has 15.2%.  Could this really hold up in a Phoenix summer?  Happily the answer is yes.  I can&#x27;t say if it lives up to the 48 hour protection claim due to taking daily showers, but it definitely works a lot better than regular deodorant.  No sweating!  I also haven&#x27;t noticed any white marks left on my clothing which is great.  It has a nice, light clean smelling scent.</li>
    <li> This is my absolute favorite scent of all the Dove deodorants and I like that I can catch a tiny whiff of this clean fresh fragrance throughout the day when I am stressed or outside in the 100 degree heat of my beloved state of Texas. This is serious 48-hour odor and wetness fighting deodorant and it cares for your armpits by with &amp;#34;Nutrium Moisture&amp;#34; to make them soft and smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on my shirts. But the fragrance will win you over especially if you don&#x27;t like the baby powder scents of some other brands of deodorants. Dove is one of my go-to brands of deodorant and when I went to Las Vegas I took a travel size of another brand and it did NOT work as well and I really missed how Dove glides on and moisturized my skin while protecting me from sweating!</li>
    <li> Seriously, I am wearing this as I write this review.  It&#x27;s been ugly hot in So Cal the past week or so and this deodorant has made life more pleasant (and those around me are likely pleased as well).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The deodorant goes on nicely - no stickiness or build up of white gunk.  It&#x27;s got a clean scent that isn&#x27;t overwhelming to my poor allergy-infested nose and sinuses.  And it protects me all day - even in the extreme heat.  And finally, no ugly white residue left on my clothes - even when I wear black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply terrific deodorant that I&#x27;ll continue to use!</li>
