      <li>Grandkids loved them!</li>
      <li>The girls loved them!</li>
      <li>and my niece loved them!</li>
      <li>It provided great moisture for her lips.</li>
      <li>My girls loved that there were Frozen characters on the tubes.  </li>
      <li>Granddaughter loved this item</li>
      <li>Smells good, sticky but my Elsa fan loves</li>

      <li>So cute for my daughter&#x27;s Frozen party.</li>
      <li>the girls love all of it</li>
      <li>Got this for my 11 year old granddaughter and she loved it.</li>
      <li>The labels peel off right away, leaving the tubes without the characters on them.  </li>
      <li>Exactly what was advertised.</li>
      <li>Product was exactly as described.</li>
      <li>Much nicer than I had anticipated</li>
      <li>The lip gloss, in reality, is very sticky, tastes yucky, and can even stain (when it squishes out too fast and then gets on hands and clothing.)  </li>
      <li>Whereas both girls usually love lip glosses and chapsticks (even without movie characters), and will use them until they are gone, these have already been cast aside - less than a month after receiving them as holiday gifts.</li>
      <li>Little girls love this</li>
