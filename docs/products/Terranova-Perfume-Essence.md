      <li>I love this product and hope it NEVER goes away.  </li>
      <li>I am also looking for a true rose fragrance and haven&#x27;t found that yet either.  </li>
      <li>Have received many complements from the most important people in the room, Men</li>

      <li>It has a lovely light scent with an oil substance and it stays with you all day.  </li>
      <li>The best thing about this purchase was it came in a cute little bottle.  </li>
      <li>Kinda strong.</li>

      <li>Was fantastic and lasted all day.</li>
      <li>It smells great, but the fact that the spell fades I only gave it four stars.</li>

      <li>very nice Gardenia smell, but didn&#x27;t last on me...</li>
      <li>When I opened the bottle I got a hint of gardenia but another fragrance was more evident.</li>
      <li>True gardenia scent.  </li>
      <li>Sweet, yet overpowering.</li>
      <li>I am enjoying it so much.  </li>
      <li>I was really pleased with this product and how fast it came in the mail.</li>
      <li>So it is a gardenia perfume in &amp;#34;essence&amp;#34; true to its name.</li>
      <li>It is a delicate scent and the most remarkable &#x27;gardenia&#x27; fragrance.  </li>
      <li>It was worth getting.</li>
      <li>A little goes a long way, but it has the most wonderful pure gardenia fragrance you can imagine.  </li>
      <li>I love the smell of this product, and based on the previous reviews I thought it would be a lot stronger, but it is actually strong at first, but fades.</li>
      <li>This is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>I first opened Gardenia</li>
      <li>It was a rather pleasant scent but not  memorable and if I had sampled it in a store I would not have purchased it.  </li>
      <li>This was not as close to a real gardenia as I had hoped and gave it 3 stars.</li>
      <li>/&gt;or cologne at the mall, try on some samples and then compare prices on the web for any that really interest me.</li>
      <li>Note to self: &amp;#34;essence&amp;#34; is an important key word.</li>
      <li>I am constantly getting stopped and asked what do you have on because you smell fabulous.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m thankful that I didn&#x27;t spend too much on them.</li>
      <li>Thanks, Amazon.</li>
      <li>I felt like I was in a very relaxing place.</li>
      <li>Thanks so much .</li>
      <li>the scent seemed very overpowering, but once I dabbed it on my skin</li>
      <li>so you don&#x27;t have to bathe in it but can get a nice uplifting effect with just a few drops.  </li>
      <li>I get a lot of compliments on this particular one.</li>
      <li>I have owned Terranova since jr high.</li>
      <li>I bought a little bottle because I read some reviews and decided to try it since I love Gardenia.  </li>
      <li>I love a few of the scents, and the gardenia was really overpowering and old woman smelling.</li>
      <li>but I am looking for the old Tuvache Jungle Gardenia-type fragrance</li>
      <li>I think he nearly proposed before I sent him home with the clothes I had of his.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This wasn&#x27;t worth the money I spent on it.  </li>
      <li>This gardenia composition is strong on white florals, has a green note running through it and is warmed up by musk, This isn&#x27;t a screetchy gardenia</li>
      <li>Not exactly what I was looking for, but it is a decent everyday fragrance when lightly used.</li>
      <li>I have recently purchased several gardenia fragrances and only one of them came close to smelling like a real gardenia to me.  </li>
      <li>Fast shipping, came before the expected date.</li>

<li> After researching and reading several Amazon and other Internet reviews of gardenia perfumes, I chose Terranova Gardenia Perfume Essence, and also Jovan Island Gardenia.  </li>
<li> Every single time I wear it (which is every day)</li>

<li> This may be a tiny bottle but a little bit goes a long way.</li>
<li> I liked that it was an oil base which made it a little longer lasting</li>
<li> You only need a few drops.</li>
<li> A little goes a long way.</li>
<li> A little bit goes a long way</li>
<li> Other gardenia perfumes do not compare to this fragrance.  </li>
<li> Very small thought I was purchasing a larger bottle for the price</li>
<li> This perfume essence smell like gardenias -- not alcohol -- with a little spice.  </li>
<li> A little dab will do ya.  </li>
<li> and you&#x27;ll gets subtle wafts of the scent all day long.  </li>
<li> I used a few drops on my dress as well</li>
<li> Not sure what it smells like.</li>
<li> It is a very small bottle and all one needs is a couple of drops.  </li>
<li> Not happy with this.</li>
<li> /&gt;It also drove my ex crazy..</li>
<li> I was terribly disappointed.  </li>
<li> I was disappointed with the Jovan Island Gardenia, but I will review that under that product heading.</li>
<li> This perfume has none of those nasty fixatives that cause the sent to turn on your skin.  </li>

    <li> Really a beautiful fragrance ! love it. Thanks so much .</li>
    <li> Love it!  True gardenia scent.  I&#x27;ve received compliments on this.</li>
    <li> Everytime I used it everybody give me compliments regarding it. I love it!</li>
    <li> This product is exceptional.  I have been using this for over 12 months.  I am constantly getting stopped and asked what do you have on because you smell fabulous.</li>
    <li> based on the reviews, I thought this would be a great and true gardenia fragrance....so I purchased two. On me, this smells nothing like gardenias. It resembles something my grandmother would wear. Sweet, yet overpowering. I&#x27;m bummed that I now have two bottles of a fragrance I will never wear. I&#x27;m thankful that I didn&#x27;t spend too much on them.</li>
    <li> Mmmmmm. Luscious sensual gardenia.  Divine. This perfume has none of those nasty fixatives that cause the sent to turn on your skin.  What you start with is what you end with.  Will purchase again.  Will not mention this to a soul because I want to be the only one in the room wearing this.  Have received many complements from the most important people in the room, Men</li>
    <li> Very true to gardenia - the best since Sarah Micheals dry oil gardenia - which is no longer produced. - If you are a gardenia fan, this is for you.</li>
    <li> Was fantastic and lasted all day. A little goes a long way. I combined mine along side ,&amp;#34;forever florals,&amp;#34; Made in Hawaii&amp;#34;, Gardenia spray cologne&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is not too strong but still has a nice fragrance. It lasts all day. I get a lot of compliments on this particular one. Fast shipping, came before the expected date. I always buy 2 at a time. Great price</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and decided to try it.  Not as advertised.  When I opened the bottle I got a hint of gardenia but another fragrance was more evident. It took me awhile but I finally figured out what it was. Olive Oil! That was the smell.  I no longer smell the gardenia.  Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> Very nice gardenia scent that doesn&#x27;t have a lot of anything else.  Just a dab here and there and you&#x27;ll gets subtle wafts of the scent all day long.  I&#x27;m glad I decided to try this instead of some more mainstream gardenia scents.  This is exactly what I was looking for.  Now I need to try out some of the matching body products.</li>
    <li> This perfume essence smell like gardenias -- not alcohol -- with a little spice.  I&#x27;ll purchase again when this one runs out.</li>
    <li> Smells nothing like gardenia. Not sure what it smells like. Kinda strong. Not like any flower. Not happy with this.</li>
    <li> i have several gardenia shrub and I know the smell of gardenia&lt;br /&gt;this not even smell like gardenia or have any pleasant smell&lt;br /&gt;do not buy</li>
    <li> Works well as a perfume, with a light application.  Also good for light-bulb rings - makes for a tropical ambiance.</li>
    <li> Did not meet up to my expectations and didn&#x27;t smell like gardenias however the company is 1st rate they refunded my money immediately and I would order from them again with a different product</li>
    <li> very nice Gardenia smell, but didn&#x27;t last on me... guess nothing will ever truly compare to Jungle Gardenia (sigh)</li>
    <li> I have owned Terranova since jr high. I love a few of the scents, and the gardenia was really overpowering and old woman smelling.</li>
    <li> Not 100% gardenia smell.</li>
    <li> It had been a few months since my 5 year old daughter had put water in the last few drops of my water petals bottle that I had had for 10 or more years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gardenia is not water petals but I loved Water Petals and I love Gardenia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also drove my ex crazy.. I think he nearly proposed before I sent him home with the clothes I had of his.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it on because I didn&#x27;t think he would like it. Its nothing nothing nothing like victoria secrets love spell which is what he calls his favorite scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first opened Gardenia the scent seemed very overpowering, but once I dabbed it on my skin I felt like I was in a very relaxing place. It&#x27;s just a really beautiful scent.</li>
    <li> I have recently purchased several gardenia fragrances and only one of them came close to smelling like a real gardenia to me.  This one is NOT that one!!  It was a rather pleasant scent but not  memorable and if I had sampled it in a store I would not have purchased it.  I liked that it was an oil base which made it a little longer lasting but I am looking for the old Tuvache Jungle Gardenia-type fragrance and this did not measure up.  Also, when I uncapped it the bottleneck top was chipped.  The best thing about this purchase was it came in a cute little bottle.  I am also looking for a true rose fragrance and haven&#x27;t found that yet either.  In future I will shop for perfume&lt;br /&gt;or cologne at the mall, try on some samples and then compare prices on the web for any that really interest me.</li>
    <li> Not exactly what I was looking for, but it is a decent everyday fragrance when lightly used. Note to self: &amp;#34;essence&amp;#34; is an important key word. So it is a gardenia perfume in &amp;#34;essence&amp;#34; true to its name. No points off for honesty and accuracy.</li>
    <li> This fragrance stays with you all day long!  It is a delicate scent and the most remarkable &#x27;gardenia&#x27; fragrance.  My father always kept gardenias and this fragrance is akin to a gardenia in the house or garden.  This exceeds all expectation.  I am enjoying it so much.  Other gardenia perfumes do not compare to this fragrance.  I have finally found my signature fragrance.  I used a few drops on my dress as well and I am pleased with results.  This is the first time that I have chosen to write a review and the reason is that I am very impressed with this product.  It is a very small bottle and all one needs is a couple of drops.  I am grateful for the product and the excellence in service.  -The wife.</li>
    <li> A little dab will do ya.  One drop of this is sufficient to keep you smelling like a flower all day...and then some.</li>
    <li> This wasn&#x27;t worth the money I spent on it.  Didn&#x27;t have the gardenia scent.  I was terribly disappointed.  Also, it was oily.  Perfume isn&#x27;t suppose to be that way.</li>
    <li> This may be a tiny bottle but a little bit goes a long way. You only need a few drops. Love the smell</li>
    <li> Very small thought I was purchasing a larger bottle for the price</li>
    <li> I have decided this perfume is one of the most enjoyable fragrances I have ever had.  I ordered it looking for a nice gardenia experience and this is it.  Every single time I wear it (which is every day) I get compliments.  A little bit goes a long way so you don&#x27;t have to bathe in it but can get a nice uplifting effect with just a few drops.  I love this product and hope it NEVER goes away.  Thanks, Amazon.</li>
    <li> I bought a little bottle because I read some reviews and decided to try it since I love Gardenia.  This was not as close to a real gardenia as I had hoped and gave it 3 stars.</li>
    <li> I was really pleased with this product and how fast it came in the mail. It has a lovely light scent with an oil substance and it stays with you all day.  Unlike some perfumes that are strong and knocks you off of your feet.  It was worth getting.</li>
    <li> This gardenia composition is strong on white florals, has a green note running through it and is warmed up by musk, This isn&#x27;t a screetchy gardenia but instead is a quieter scent arrangement. Has great sillage, or lasting power.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this product, and based on the previous reviews I thought it would be a lot stronger, but it is actually strong at first, but fades. It smells great, but the fact that the spell fades I only gave it four stars. I wish the smell lasted all day. It does remind me of Hawaii!</li>
    <li> After researching and reading several Amazon and other Internet reviews of gardenia perfumes, I chose Terranova Gardenia Perfume Essence, and also Jovan Island Gardenia.  The Terranova Gardenia Perfume Essence is by far the best gardenia perfume I&#x27;ve had the pleasure of wearing.  A little goes a long way, but it has the most wonderful pure gardenia fragrance you can imagine.  Gardenias are my husband&#x27;s all-time favorite flower so he is a connoisseur of gardenia fragrances.  He LOVES it!!  He says it&#x27;s the best he&#x27;s ever smelled and is almost as good as the actual flower.  So now I&#x27;ve ordered the Body Lotion, which has 2 Amazon ratings, both 5-star.  I was disappointed with the Jovan Island Gardenia, but I will review that under that product heading.</li>
