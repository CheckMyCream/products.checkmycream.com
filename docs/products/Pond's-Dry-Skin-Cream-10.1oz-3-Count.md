<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These are great. Probably the best face wipes I have used so far. You feel so clean afterwards. Not 100% as clean as using actual soap and water but very close. I didn&#x27;t feel the need to rinse with water afterwards or anything. These kept my face clean while camping. I shared with a few friends and they all said that they worked really, really well.</li>
    <li> These are my favorite facial wipes.  They smell fantastic and they clean my face nicely.  The packaging keeps them moist better than some other brands I&#x27;ve tried.  Love these!</li>
    <li> These r really nice. They&#x27;re creamy. Feel real good.</li>
    <li> Really like these toweletts, they do a great job of face cleansing, thicker than others with mild scent, shall definitely purchase more of these, great item!</li>
    <li> Worked well I hate they stop having these in the subscribe and save.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my 9 year old daughter and now i use them.  They are convenient work great and smell good.</li>
    <li> Takes all my makeup off! Wipes smell good and are thick. I would def. recommend this. Love these wipes, worth the buy.</li>
    <li> Tried so many of these &amp; this is the only one that completely removed my eye makeup! Definitely recommend to others!</li>
    <li> Love these just about the same as the originals.  I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in them.</li>
    <li> I simply love these little cloths! I&#x27;ve used a lot of the facal towelettes in the last year, and these have emerged as my favorite. I like the smell very much, though the Evening Soothe scent might be slightly in the lead. Whatever cleaner Ponds uses on these is very gentle and seems a little more &amp;#34;foamy&amp;#34; than many, so it leaves your face feeling very fresh, but not dry. These also have a very nice quilted texture that seems to remove makeup better than smooth towelettes (plus feels cushy on your face). These are so great for taking off makeup at night...or to keep at work for a quick clean-up...or to have in your bag to wipe off the crud of a long flight. Great product.</li>
    <li> I love these. Some evenings after a long day at work and school, I get home late and am too exhausted to spend all kinds of time removing makeup. Makeup removal is a snap using these towelettes. And these particular towelettes have a very pleasant scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend these.</li>
    <li> Omg! I LOVE THESE. They make your skin so soft and unlike other POND&#x27;S wipes (I&#x27;ve tried them all) these don&#x27;t dry your skin. In fact they seem to make it more moisturized. My skin just seems to glow after I use these. Never had this effect with any other wipes.</li>
    <li> I have used many different makeup towelettes...some 5 times as expensive and this is by FAR the BEST ever! The towelette is larger, thicker, and has more product on it than one that is out by a well known skin care line at 5 times the cost. I am impressed as it is also a skin treatment rather than simply a makeup remover...it leaves the skin with an almost resurfaced micro dermabrasion..gentle yes, but noticeable. I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a long time user of Neutrogena Makeup Remover Cleansing Towelettes and I have tried some other brand but I always go back to Neutrogena. In this case the towelettes are this odd almost netted material that feels rough on my sensitive skin. They are also not very effective in removing makeup, especially eye makeup as I&#x27;d have to &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; my eye area with this rough towelette which is very unpleasant and then I&#x27;d still have makeup on accompanied by my now raw feeling skin. My other issue is the packing doesn&#x27;t seal so they are left to dry out and become useless. I tried taping over the seal with tape with no luck.&lt;br /&gt;I will be going back to the Neutrogena Makeup Remover Cleansing Towelettes as they are more effective, cheaper, and more pleasant to use overall.</li>
    <li> These wipes are so handy.  They are very moist. .. not dry at all. They are thick and soft.  No water needed. Great for a full clean on the go. I highly recommend</li>
    <li> You can always count on Ponds for quality and affordability I use these as a makeup remover or as a convenient non liquid for your carry on to keep your skin moist during a flight. Always performs.  :-)</li>
    <li> Wife is impressed by the cleansing power to remove her make-up AFTER her initial cleaning; and the fact it moisturizes at the same time, it is a plus.  Got a 66-wipe pack just recently.</li>
    <li> It makes me feel my skin great. It is a great quality product. I feel my skin clean every time that I use it.</li>
    <li> I love these! They remove all my make up easily and gently, even eye make up!  They smell good and do not dry my skin. My skin feels clean and fresh after using them. They are also great to freshen up your neck or other areas on a hot day. Great product!</li>
    <li> I bought these wipes to remove makeup, but it just doesn&#x27;t work that well for waterproof products. It smeared eyeliner all over my lid and the areas surrounding my eyes. The wipe eventually cleaned it all up but it took a lot of wiping which I don&#x27;t think is good for the skin in that region.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of this product is awful. It was like wiping a nail salon on my face. I guess I shouldn&#x27;t be complaining since I only paid $3.50, but I think in the future I&#x27;ll pay extra for something that works better and smells better.</li>
    <li> Nice refreshing feeling from using these wipes it leaves no residue and cleans very effectively I recommend this product to anyone</li>
    <li> They are the best towelette wipes. I love the texture and smell of them. They get all my makeup off and I have bought them every month for about a year and won&#x27;t stop ordering. They are wonderful and helping me to keep my skin clean and clear. :)</li>
    <li> The smell is a little odd and it takes a bit to get my waterproof mascara off. I find I need to still wash my face after the wipe because there is still some make up left on my face.</li>
    <li> I would say these are the second best cleansing clothes I&#x27;ve used.  What really surprised me about these is how moist they are.  I hate that most of the brands I&#x27;ve tried are really dry.  These actually had bubbles on them when I pulled them out of the package, that&#x27;s how saturated they are with product!  They are a nice texture, great for a light scrub but not abrasive.  The smell is nothing overwhelming or offensive.  The thing that I dislike about these is that they seem to really dry my skin out.  The other ones I like, yes to cucumbers, is a really moisture rich cloth.  These promise moisture but they really don&#x27;t deliver.  It doesn&#x27;t bother me too much because I use a separate cream every night after cleansing.  I would definitely buy these again and will continue to try more ponds products.</li>
    <li> These are very good facial wipes. I use every AM to clean face before moisturizing. Cooling and refreshing. Help with puffiness.</li>
    <li> The Pond&#x27;s name is almost synonymous with cold cream which is the first thing I think of when I think of waterless makeup removal, so I was eager to try these Pond&#x27;s wet towelettes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not disappointed. The Pond&#x27;s towelettes do a good job of removing makeup--even eye makeup. They don&#x27;t leave a greasy residue and they don&#x27;t dry out my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I consider myself to be a soap and water girl but I usually keep makeup remover towelettes on hand for occasional use. I&#x27;ve used several brands including Olay and Philosophy and several generics like CVS and Walgreens. The Pond&#x27;s towelettes do a better job of makeup removal than most of the ones I&#x27;ve tried although there is not a whole lot of difference in how they work. However, the real beauty of these is in the texture of the fabric. They have a diamond weave that does a good job of cleaning without feeling rough or scratchy. The towelettes also seem to be thicker and a much better quality than others I&#x27;ve used. They hold up very well and have a luxurious feel.</li>
    <li> These Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean Wet Towelettes are a great way to remove your make-up. They are lightly scented and non-irritating (I have sensitive skin).  They are large enough to do a couple of swipes meaning you can get all your foundation and eye makeup off with one towelette.  I was really impressed with how well they removed my mascara (ultra waterproof blackest black).  Better, there&#x27;s some kind of conditioner in there that makes your skin look freash and glowing the next morning.</li>
    <li> Sometimes when I get into bed and lie down, I remember I haven&#x27;t washed my face.  Now I just reach over on the nightstand and grab one of these to do a quick clean.  Beats totally neglecting my skin. It feels good and smells great.</li>
    <li> best makeup remover ever!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous facial cleansing cloths, but this one is the VERY BEST!! I&#x27;m sold on it! The cloths are large, unlike some brands that you have to use 2+ to clean your face and eye makeup. It also has plenty of the cleansing solution, and you don&#x27;t have to rinse it off with water. The best thing is that it contains some clay, so that it &amp;#34;sucks&amp;#34; out all of the grime that gets into your pores. I can actually feel it working. It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out at all; my face feels SO clean after I use this product. I really believe this is THE BEST facial cleansing cloth ever. I haven&#x27;t used any other brand since I found this one. It is a good bargain, too.</li>
    <li> Works well to remove stage make up.  My daughter was in a play and had to have full on makeup.  These worked well to remove the make up right after the play and seemed to be gentle on her skin.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and these towelettes were too strong for my skin. The cloth is probably soft enough for most people but for me it felt a little abrasive. I think it was the ingredients of the cleanser component that was most irritating for my skin. After I used it, my skin always felt a little raw and pink. Not for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying various towelettes for at least the last 15 years with varying degrees of satisfaction.  The very first Ponds Luminous Clean towelette I tried, 15 days ago, convinced me I&#x27;d never have to switch again. It removed an embarrassing amount of makeup residue even after showering, and left my 67-year-old face feeling so fresh and natural that I nearly forgot my moisturizer.  The only reason I tried this product was the kaolin, a fine clay used in porcelain making, with which I was familiar.  Never stop of offering this product, please! It is wonderful!</li>
    <li> these towelettes are so nice to have. very easy to clean your face and they are very soft and smell very nice</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really glad I needed some more items to get to the $25 add-on limit. I haven&#x27;t noticed these in stores, but I&#x27;m LOVING the textured cloth. I feel like it gets my face even cleaner, but is still very gentile. Will definitely be buying these again.</li>
    <li> If you are sensitive to fragrance, please stay away from this. While the scent is nice, it is too strong. My sister thought I was trying a new perfume when I first opened the package. The towel has &amp;#34;holes&amp;#34; and is a bit small, but should be enough for the face and neck. What I find weird is that they are soapy-ish, maybe it&#x27;s just me but I really don&#x27;t like the texture. It does a great job cleaning the face but it feels really dry afterwards. Will I repurchase? No, but will try the other variants.</li>
    <li> I really like these face wipes for everyday use.  I like the &amp;#34;wetness&amp;#34; of them (wetter than most), they take makeup off pretty easily, and they smell nice to boot.  They also don&#x27;t leave my face feeling like there&#x27;s this tacky residue left behind.  I&#x27;ve used lots of different brands of face wipes, and these are my favorite.  Actually, all of the different types of Ponds wipes work great, for the record, but the scent of these is the best.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use these as a regular cleanser because I think the wipes are a little rough on your skin. But I use these while I&#x27;m traveling (for airplanes, etc.) and they&#x27;re perfect for that purpose.</li>
    <li> These are the face-cleaning cloths I was searching for. I use only face cream and no makeup but the Arizona air leaves a coat of dust on my face most days. These clean the face and neck area and leave my skin feeling as soft as if I had already put on some night cream. Great washcloths too for traveling.</li>
    <li> After wiping my face down with Pond&#x27;s cold cleansing cream it always feels too greasy, and face wash alone doesn&#x27;t seem to remove that. I use this immediately after the cold cleansing cream and wallah, more dirt and makeup is removed.  smells delightful too!</li>
    <li> I love using the Pond&#x27;s towelettes because they all stay really moist (even if you leave the flap open) and work well in removing makeup, without leaving any greasy feeling.  You feel very refreshed and clean after using them, and they smell good too.</li>
    <li> Love these! I used to purchase them on my monthly shopping trips, I found them on subscribe and save now I pay much less and get them on a monthly basis delivered to my home for free.</li>
    <li> I Love Pond&#x27;s face cloths! They smell nice, get all the makeup off and they don&#x27;t dry out my skin or make me break out. All other face cloths that I&#x27;ve used, have dried out my skin too much. I have used these for years!</li>
    <li> work great at taking off mascara</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several face wipes and this is my favorite kind by far. I&#x27;m not sure how to describe what is good about it, it&#x27;s more what it isn&#x27;t. For instance, I tried &amp;#34;Yes to&amp;#34; cucumber and grape ones and they both were heavily scented. The Ponds face wipes are either not scented or are a clean fresh smell, like baby powder or linen, so I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m putting on a fake fragrance and smelling it on my face afterwards. Plus Ponds has this &amp;#34;quilted&amp;#34;  thing going on (I compare it to the quilted toilet paper or paper towel) that really feel like it is catching more dirt then a flat towelette. I usually take my eye make-up off with coco butter or baby powder Vaseline (grandma&#x27;s trick) and then follow it up with one of these. Turns out I&#x27;ve been leaving mascara on and I never knew, because the Ponds has been picking it up.</li>
    <li> Being a busy mom to an almost-3-year-old daughter, I LOVE the portability and speed of using the Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean Towelettes!  They are perfect for airport travel or just a quick cleansing at the end of a hectic day at home.  The textured cloths deep clean without scratching and leave skin, well, luminous.</li>
    <li> Pond&#x27;s Luninous clean towlettes are Excellent wipes, doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin, exfoliates great, smells fresh, the towlettes are gentle, even if you have sinsitive skin. They are  Non break out causing. Definately cleans, your skin will be soft. The towlettes did leave a bit of makeup on the skin still even with wearing minimal makeup so that is my only drawback that I found. The towlettes are excellent on the go, they are non drying and a good buy.</li>
    <li> It does its job, it removes my face makeup pretty well. I always use an eye makeup remover for my eye makeup since I wear waterproof mascara and eyeliner, so I don&#x27;t know if it works on eye makeup.&lt;br /&gt;However, one thing I do not like is the scent. It&#x27;s way too strong and perfumey for my liking.</li>
    <li> I actually like these better than Okay brand.  Seems to do a better job of removing mascara and make up.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> I love these face wipes they are simply the best and they smell so so good! This does not take the place of washing your face but they are great for a quick clean before a workout</li>
    <li> This has long been a favorite of my wife but is frequently sold out at local stores.  It&#x27;s great to have a steady supply.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Ponds cold cream to remove makeup for at least 50 years and began using it when in high school because that is what my mother had in the bathroom and what she&#x27;s always used.  Over the years, I&#x27;ve tried other, more expensive, face creams and specialty eye makeup remover-but always come back to Ponds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went on a cruise over the 2013 Christmas holidays and needed something lightweight to take for makeup remover, rather than the whole large jar I use at home...these towelettes were perfect.  I didn&#x27;t have to use soap or water and my makeup, including waterproof mascara, was removed every night..I really didn&#x27;t even need my usual moistureizer because the towelettes are quite moisturizing themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is lightweight and the product excellent.  though I won&#x27;t chooses to use these daily at home I will keep some on hand for trips..so handy.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Ponds for a great product</li>
    <li> Continue to reorder this.  Best makeup remover!</li>
    <li> i would not order again.  don&#x27;t care for the product.</li>
    <li> My face is too sensitive to these face towelettes, I have to go back to my sensitive skin ones, these burn. I have skin lupus and skin rosacea I can&#x27;t use these.</li>
    <li> great for sensitive skin</li>
    <li> I have mature very dry skin and it is also sensitive! Love these towelettes, they are not drying in the least and leave your skin so soft!! Hard to find products that do that anymore! Great Find!!</li>
    <li> These things are really great for getting makeup off. Another thing about them is that they are pretty cheap. f</li>
    <li> These are handy for those oops moments when I screw up doing my makeup, for for those lazy moments when I just don&#x27;t want to wash my whole face.</li>
    <li> Towelettes came a little dry.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve tried other wipes in the past but weren&#x27;t especially happy with them, give these a try. After trying several different brands, including &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and expensive ones, I am most pleased with these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wipes themselves are textured, but not scratchy. They provide a gentle level of daily exfoliation without being irritating to sensitive skin even around the eyes. The wipes are wet enough that you can use both sides of the wipe completely without it drying out. The wipes really remove makeup well, even mascara, without irritating my sensitive eyes. (I don&#x27;t know if they work well on waterproof mascara because I don&#x27;t wear it.) My daughter used a Burt&#x27;s Bees wipe to remove her makeup, then used one of these and was surprised at how much make-up had remained on her face. The scent of the wipes is pleasant but not overpowering and remains consistent throughout use. (I noticed the Burt&#x27;s Bees wipes that start with a grapefruit scent that is quite refreshing when you take them from the package quickly begin to smell &amp;#34;off.&amp;#34;) The wipes leave my face feeling clean and soft, lightly moisturized but not sticky. The tape that reseals the package works well, even if you ask it to hold that seal longer than a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the thing I like best about these wipes is that after using them for a month, the tone and texture of my skin has improved! My skin texture is better: my skin is softer and the flakiness is gone. My skin tone is more even and the faint beginnings of age spots (the horror!) have disappeared. When I&#x27;m not wearing make-up and just using these to cleanse my face, I often use them on my forearms as well: the age spots on my forearms are definitely less pronounced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are a definite winner and will be a staple of my skin care routine for a long time to come.</li>
    <li> Gets all the dirt and make-up off without drying my skin.  I also have sensitive skin and have no problems with these!</li>
    <li> EDIT 8/24/2013&lt;br /&gt;Eight months after using this product for the first time, I find myself consistently coming back to it (or similar products in the same Ponds line). Being that most makeup removing towelettes come in a package of 30, I go through one pack every 30-40 days. In the past eight months I have tried Neutrogena, Olay, and Yes to Cucumbers, but none compare to Ponds. I just find that Ponds towelettes (whether I get this, the Original [[ASIN:B00B1F0T90 Pond&#x27;s Wet Cleansing Towelettes, Original Fresh, 30-Count (Pack of 3)]], or the Evening Soothe [[ASIN:B003ZYL2DW POND&#x27;S Evening Soothe Wet Cleansing Towelettes, 30-Count (Pack of 2)]]) remove makeup much better than other brands, and don&#x27;t leave a gross film on my face after using. Definitely my favorite towelette!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL REVIEW&lt;br /&gt;I have used different brands of make up removers before, and think this is the best by far. Recently I have been using a generic store brand which smelled weird and also burned my eyes if I wasn&#x27;t careful, and wasn&#x27;t very effective. I love these Ponds wipes - they&#x27;re textured to kind of exfoliate the skin while you&#x27;re wiping, and they have a really pleasant smell. I don&#x27;t consider myself sensitive to smells, though, and my friend said the floral scent was too strong. The wipes also remove most of my makeup effectively and don&#x27;t dry out my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;lll definitely be buying these again when I&#x27;m out.</li>
    <li> I use these every night.  For a &amp;#34;normal day&amp;#34; they are great.  They remove the grime and dirt and makeup off my face and neck.  however, if  I wear heavier eye make up they dont do the job at all.  They are also on the smallish side.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is \\&quot;pulling out any impurities\\&quot; but it does clean the face quite well.  These are great if you are traveling and want to have some face cloths with you if case you feel the need to wash your face.</li>
    <li> I really like these.  They left my skin clean, soft, and not at all dried out.  The last was especially impressive because a lot of products I&#x27;ve used in the past seem to suck all the moisture out of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a very, very slight soap/cleanser smell, but it is not at all overpowering, which is important to me since I&#x27;m sensitive to smells.  I do wish they foamed a bit more when used; as is you have to be very careful to clean all your skin, a task I think is easier if there is a little foam generated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only real complaint is that the adhesive designed to keep the package closed didn&#x27;t work very well.  The towelettes started to dry out, so I ended up storing the whole thing in a plastic container.  Other than that, I thought this was a good product.</li>
    <li> These smell terrible!</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  The Ponds people have been around a long time and they are very reliable.  My wife is the user and she has told me that since she recently had eye lid surgery this is the ideal thing for her face.  She had a problem with making sure that she did not wet the areas where she had stitches.  Ideal for this purpose.  Also, ideal for her facial cleansing.  Very satisifed. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> These little towelettes left my skin feeling clean and soft.  I&#x27;m not real fond of the package they come in, because it&#x27;s kind of large and funny-shaped.  It takes up a lot of space in my bathroom cabinet, but other than that, I really liked this product.  I&#x27;m not the type of person to spend a huge amount of time on beauty products, but this was easy to use and didn&#x27;t take much time, so it fit into my lifestyle easily.  I have very sensitive skin and allergies to fragrances, so some skin products irritate my skin and the fragrance of some beauty products bother me, but this did not.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a Pond&#x27;s brand product before.  I always used Aveeno, Clean n Clear, or store brand facial towelettes to clean off my makeup at night.  These Luminous Clean wipes are fantastic!  They are not too wet, and won&#x27;t leave your face too damp like other wipes.  They are textured, which is great for taking off eye makeup and lipstick but they don&#x27;t feel too rough.  I also really like the fragrance, which smells clean.  Also, they are much bigger than I expected. Try Pond&#x27;s, you will like them!</li>
    <li> Ponds Luminous Clean products are wonderful! First off - the smell is delicious. It has a nice light, floral scent. Cream Cleanser went on smooth and came off easily during rinsing. It left my face clean, moisturized and smelling wonderful. The soft white Kaolin clay really helped get the dirt and impurities from my pores and left my face radiant. The wet cleansing towelettes left the same refreshing, clean feeling as the cream cleanser but are more convienent when in a hurry or just needing a quick refresher - would be perfect to throw in a gym bag.</li>
    <li> These are great, my skin gets so oily during the day and I use these at work to freshen up.  They have a great mild scent, clean well and don&#x27;t dry my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I tried this product free through BzzAgent.</li>
    <li> These Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean Towelettes are a great way to clean your face on the go. Perfect for throwing in your gym bag. They leave your face feeling clean and your skin soft. It can be difficult to remove waterproof eye-makeup with these wipes, but overall, if you&#x27;re looking to feel refreshed, the wipes are great!</li>
    <li> I recently had the great opportunity as a bzz agent to try this amazing product for free. I am normally hesitant to try new products due to having sensitive skin. I gave them a shot and I am so excited that I now have these!! Having these is so convenient. I go to the gym and tanning bed and its nice to throw these in my gym bag or to wipe off all my makeup before tanning. Fresh, clean feeling. The scent is so light and refreshing. And I never have a temptation of going to sleep with makeup on my face again, just one towelette and I&#x27;m all set. I wish I had found these sooner! Try it out, you won&#x27;t be disappointed :)</li>
    <li> Having breakout-prone skin, I&#x27;m always looking for products that leave my face noticeably clean. The Ponds Luminous Clean Towelettes I got from BzzAgent are a great, quick tool for just that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the towelettes and the cleanser together - but the cleanser didn&#x27;t blow me away. It&#x27;s an iridescent wash that is more creamy than sudsy. It left my face feeling clean and less oily, but not nearly as fresh or airy as other cleansers I&#x27;ve used. It does, however live up to the promise of &#x27;drawing out impurities.&#x27; After the first couple of uses, I was totally grossed out by the amount of gunk in my pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The towelettes have been awesome. They&#x27;re a good end-of-the-day make up remover or quick cleaner before putting on new makeup. They shine as a grab-and-go wipe if you like to start fresh any time during the day - making them absolutely perfect in my gym bag. They&#x27;ve also been great for a quick refresh if my skin is feeling dirty on a make up-free day.</li>
    <li> The size/shape of the Ponds Luminous Towelettes is a bit bulky to toss in a purse, but I would definitely use it for traveling (when you don&#x27;t want to deal with a lot of liquids and creams in luggage) or for after my face painting gigs. I was in face paints for a clown party and one strong, but gentle wipe took all the clown makeup off easily! It would make normal everyday makeup removal a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell and am left feeling fresh and clean. #gotitfree</li>
    <li> I was so very excited to receive these to try from BzzAgent. I absolutely love them. They just feel so nice on the face and do a great job at removing everything including all of my make up. AND with only one towelette because they are a nice size. The scent is very mild and doesn&#x27;t linger which is great as I am sensitive to harsh scents. I have always been VERY bad at making sure I wash my face before bed but with these its SOO easy to make sure I have a nice clean face before falling asleep. I would not say though that these are for daily on-the-go purposes as the package is too large for an every day purse. But these would be great to have in a bag when traveling.</li>
    <li> I am loving this product! I use the POND&#x27;S Luminous Clean Towelettes for a quick clean and freshening up of my face whether I&#x27;m in a hurry to go somewhere and get out the door or to take with me! There is no need to rinse after using these towelettes and your skill feels so soft and clean... not to mention that it smells so good!</li>
    <li> The POND&#x27;S luminous towelettes left my skin feeling clean without it being too oily or too dry. The smell isn&#x27;t too fragrant, which is hard to come by, and had a spa-esque scent. They made a good lather while still light and wasn&#x27;t hard to wash off. It removed all make-up with minimal left under my eye...could easily remove with a Q-Tip...just like every other cleanser I have used. The towelettes are great if you want to freshen up your face without messing up your eye makeup and would be PERFECT while on travel. I would recommend to a friend and would buy again.</li>
    <li> I really like this product - the fragrance is light and delicate, not overwhelming, and the towelettes do a nice cleaning job on my face without irritating it.  I have found that makeup removal is quite easy with the aid of these wipes, and I don&#x27;t have to spend a ton of time wiping around my eyes over and over trying to remove the eyeliner and mascara - they seem to do the job pretty quickly, which I like.  I don&#x27;t enjoy having to scrub and scrub and irritate my eyes trying to remove the day&#x27;s makeup, like I do with some brands - and I don&#x27;t even wear eyeliner or mascara that heavily!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having sensitive skin, I&#x27;m always looking for something that won&#x27;t irritate it, and this product by Pond&#x27;s really did the trick for me!  The wipes are nice for a quick clean if you are feeling a bit greasy and gross during the day, or a nice, thorough clean at the end of the day after hours of exposure to whatever the world brings you.  I cannot say enough great things about these wipes, and will be continuing to use them in my daily routine.</li>
    <li> Ouch! These burned my eyes! Smelled good, but hurt to use. I switched to Nuetrogena wipes and am much happier and don&#x27;t get burned. I can dig that!</li>
    <li> Favorite makeup remover/cleansing towlette ever. The smell is heavenly and they are so soft and effective. My face feels so thoroughly clean after using these.</li>
    <li> You know how you are tired at the end of the day and you don&#x27;t want to take the 5 minutes it would take to wash your face?  Well, Ponds has the answer with these towelettes.  THEY ARE FAB!  You can wash your face with the towelette and chuck it in the bin when you are done.  These are safe enough to remove eye makeup and mascara without hurting your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are convenient to tote around (think airports, think campgrounds, think fitness center) and gentle enough on your skin to prevent breakouts.  These are a true find for those who want to take care of their skin, without being high maintenance, and great for those of us with sensitive skin</li>
    <li> I received my Ponds Luminous Clean wet cleansing towelettes and cream cleaner yesterday from bzzagent&#x27;s campaign and was surprised to find FULL SIZE products inside. I quickly opened them and tried them out. I was pleasantly surprised that it smelled nice and loved the fact that they were hypoallergenic! After the first use my skin felt much smoother, softer, and clean. The package advertises that it gently draws out trapped impurities and make-up to brighten dull skin. I highly recommend this product for people like me that have sensitive skin and I will now be purchasing it for myself.</li>
    <li> Quick, easy and convenient! Takes off all of your makeup and leaves face feeling refreshed and clean. The wipes are perfectly moist (I hate when you have to squeeze the moisture off first) and have a light pleasant smell! The best part there is no rinsing required. It feels light on your skin so you don&#x27;t even feel like you have to! Great product!</li>
    <li> These towelettes are amazing. They work perfectly when I am in a rush and they smell amazing. They leave my face feeling fresh and clean all day.</li>
    <li> I have never found a towelette cleanser that has worked on my oily skin without leaving it feeling so greasy afterwards. So far so good though. I&#x27;ve been using these for 3 days now and my face feels fresher. I would totally recommend these to anyone looking for an inexpensive cleanser on the go. I can&#x27;t wait to see how they do when I am at the ball field this summer.</li>
    <li> I have used Ponds Luminous Clean cream cleanser and towlettes make up removing wipes since receiving them compliments of Bzzagent.com.  I have noticed my skin is much more soft and less reddened after using them.  I will say that the towelettes are very good at removing the extra make up that I missed when washing my face.  I also used the towelettes when I didn&#x27;t wash my face and they removed every bit of make up I had on my face.  These towelettes have a very mild clean smell to them which is nice since I will sneeze with overly floral perfumey smells.  Also they have nice texture and are large enough to only use one per session.  I do use foundation so I had quite a bit of makeup to remove so the pack will last ~a month if using one per day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that you have to be careful around the eye area.  I was able to remove most of my mascara, shadow and eyeliner.  I did get a little close to the underside of my eye once and it was watering a lot.  I had to rinse with water as stated on the package and it subsided.  Other than that they were gentle on my skin and I did not feel that I had to rinse my skin afterwards.  I did have a small break out the first time I used the wipes which is not unusual for me after trying new cleansers.  I do recommend this product.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is the fact that it is pretty harsh on your eyes if it gets in them.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome.  I have somewhat sensitive skin that dries out quickly.  As a full time student I needed something that was easy to use on the go.  Fortunately POND&#x27;S Luminous Clean Towelettes did just the trick.  The portable 30 pack fits perfectly in a gym bag or backpack and is really simple to use.  After using one all my makeup was completely removed, it didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and thirty minutes later my face wasn&#x27;t dry at all.  And another bonus is the light and floral smell.  It is refreshing and not overbearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cream Cleanser worked just as well.  I usually use cleansers that are more of a scrub and can be abrasive.  The cream cleanser is almost the consistency of a lotion but cleans like a scrub. The best part about it is that  it&#x27;s  perfect for skin that has a tendency to break out with new products.  I occasionally have break outs and minor acne problems and the cleanser took care of my trouble spots within three days of use.  Usually after washing my face I immediately feel like I need to moisturize but that was not the case with the cream. My face felt just as smooth and soft as if I would have put on my daily face lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;POND&#x27;s has for years been a quality brand and their Luminous Clean line is an excellent addition to the quality of skin care this brand has to offer.</li>
    <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t really sure about these, but now I love them. I have a pack in my pocketbook and I have a pack at home. They go with me everywhere. They are great for removing eye makeup or any makeup for that matter. They are quick and easy and I like that. They are no rinse and they don&#x27;t leave your face feeling sticky or like there is a film or anything on it.</li>
    <li> I HAVE TO SAY YES MY FACE DOES FEEL RADIENT AND REFRESHED AND THE THE TOWLETTES WORK GREAT ON THE GO. EVERY EVENING I USE THE WET TOWLETTS BY REMOVING MY MAKEUP I DONT NEED TO USE SEVERAL ONLY ONE WIPE WORKS PERFECT IT LEAVES MY SKIN FELING SOFT I FOLLOW UP BY USING THE CREAM CLEANSER AND USE THE CLEANSER FIRST THING IN THE MORNING AND I LOVE HOW IT MAKES MY FACE FEEL THUS THIS FAR. I WOULD DEFINATLEY PRUCHASE THIS PRODUCT TO USE FOR DAIILY APPLICATIONS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANKS PONDS FOR LETTING ME TRY THIS PRODUCT!&lt;br /&gt;I WOULD DEF RECCOMEND THIS PRODUCT TO FRIENDS AND FAMILY!</li>
    <li> Gets ALL makeup off. Eyeliner, mascara, foundation.... all of it, and I only use one cloth. The nice thing is that it&#x27;s actually moist, which a lot of makeup removers are supposed to be, but aren&#x27;t. TBH, I still love my Burts Bees more, but at least with this item I don&#x27;t have to hope I&#x27;ll be lucky enough to get a moist packet. It&#x27;s a product I will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for on the go!  I throw it in my gym bag and use it every day.  The toweletts are durable and leave my face free of makeup, and they leave my face smelling clean and fresh.  I use the towelett before and after my workout.  It is gentle enough that it does not leave my skin dry.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I received as part of a Bzzkit for Bzzagent.com to try out. I was skeptical because I&#x27;ve used various cleansers and towelettes and usually they have been harsh and scratchy. I also received the luminous clean cream cleanser to try alongside the towelettes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used both products for about two weeks and not everyday. Previously, I was using Targets generic for pro active with mixed results. I suffer from adult acne and my skin looks dull and pale. I noticed that the towelettes were very gentle on my skin. I like to use them to remove my eye makeup and they didn&#x27;t leave my eyelids feeling scratched. They had a light, pleasant scent and they worked very well. I&#x27;m not sure whether it was the cream cleanser or the towelettes that had the bigger impact, but I&#x27;m sold. Even my acne has started clearing up and my face really does look brighter! It leaves my face feeling so clean, but not overly dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend anyone give this product a try for at least two weeks!</li>
    <li> These wipes are pretty amazing for a drugstore type find. The wipe is very thick, thicker than a baby wipe which I appreciate because of the texture. It is a woven kind of design so you feel like your getting a slight exfoliation from them as well. The scent of these is also very pleasant kind of a floral but not overpowering. I also did not feel a heavy residue on my face from these, my face felt smooth and fresh.</li>
    <li> I was able to try the Pond&#x27;s Luminous Cream Cleanser as well as the Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean Towlettes for free through bzzagent.com. My skin is very sensitive and I was hesitant to try these towlettes at first as most moist towlettes completely irritate my skin. I&#x27;ve used the towlettes in combination with the Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean Cleanser, and my skin has been responding amazing. My skin is moisturized and incredibly soft. The towlettes are nicely saturated and have a nice texture to them. The texture is not abrasive to the skin, and one towlette was enough to remove all my make up.</li>
    <li> The Luminous Clean wipes are so convient. They can be used any place, any time.  They give you a cool, clean &amp; refreshing feeling while working to brighten &amp; cool your skin. I carry them in my purse or the dash of my car.</li>
    <li> I hate carrying cleanser when I travel and I prefer to use towelettes like these. I&#x27;ve had some problems finding a good one recently that doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor, or leave my face feeling oily or dry. I used these and it left my face feelings clean and not dry/tight or oily. They&#x27;re nice and thick, but not too wet, and have a texture. I did notice that I had to rub a little harder to really get everything off as I initially just wiped and not much seemed to come off but when I did it again and scrubbed a little bit, a lot more dirt and makeup was left on the towelette.</li>
    <li> I love these towelettes!  I have used others in the past that leave your skin feeling like it needs to be washed again.  Pond&#x27;s formula is fresh and clean, no need to rinse or rewash.  They do have a fragrance but it is subtle and doesn&#x27;t irritate my allergies.  I love throwing these in my gym bag to have after my workout.  In the evening I love that I haven&#x27;t had to use a separate remover for my mascara!  This little towelette is amazing!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVED the Ponds Luminous clean towelettes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face felt clean, smooth and radiant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell was fresh, clean and fabulous! The product proved to be gentle on my sensitive skin and left me with a subtle dewy glow (not greasy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The towelettes are GREAT! Use for a quick \\&quot;pick me up\\&quot; and travel.  I can&#x27;t possibly list enough positives about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This ponds line surpassed its promises of clean and radiant skin...I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  I have definitely shared this gem with friends and family who are looking for an affordable skin care system  with high quality results!</li>
    <li> If you want this product just for wiping your face to feel refreshed, I guess this product will work for you. If you wear makeup then don&#x27;t even bother. I subscribed to this product on amazon for a good makeup remover (previously I was using the nutrogena ones) and this one was cheap and had good reviews. Not sure why because I had to SCRUB my eyes for all the eyeshadow and liner to come off(no I don&#x27;t use waterproof). The worst part is, the towels are so rough that it makes the scrubbing that much worse. Not sure what everyone else on these reviews looks for in a makeup remover but my old ones were one swipe and the makeup was gone...plus they were super soft.  I&#x27;m def unsubscribing and going back to my old product. They also really really dry out your skin. May be good for someone with oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just in case someone was wondering, I have very dry skin, I wear urban decay primer potion and really good quality shadows on top. I this may have something to do with it but I didn&#x27;t have a problem with my old product taking off the makeup.</li>
    <li> I use BB cream on my face every morning. So, when I get home from work, I need wet towelettes to remove the cream and any eye make up. These work really well and smell really good too.</li>
    <li> I prefer to carry towelettes when I travel rather than tubes or bottles of creams and liquids.  They are less weighty, less messy, and can be tucked about anywhere in the luggage, including carry on.  However, when making the purchase check for use on your personal skin type to assure you will have the results you wish.  I have particularly sensitive skin and this product did not feel particularly good on my face.  Otherwise, it was a good product for my need.</li>
    <li> After moving from a major city to an incredibly rural area, I couldn&#x27;t even find makeup remover wipes I liked locally. They all seemed dry and pitiful. Seriously. I sprung for these and like them a lot. They are plenty wet, hallelujah. Thankfully, they whisk away the grit, grime and makeup and they smell lovely. The texture is nice. These aren&#x27;t marketed as having exfoliating properties, but the texture of the wipe is so rich, I felt a smoothness afterwards that I wasn&#x27;t experiencing prior to this. Nice work Pond&#x27;s. I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing more of these.</li>
    <li> Luminous Clean is the newest of the Pond&#x27;s cleansing towelettes, and like the other towelettes in the Pond&#x27;s line, they&#x27;re very effective at removing dirt and makeup  The scent is quite pleasant - light and fresh.  I find the towelettes to be gentle on my skin while providing just the right amount of exfoliation, but those with very sensitive skin might want to opt for the Luminous Clean Cleansing Cream instead of the towelettes. I have the cleansing cream and alternate between the cream and the towelettes.  The price on Amazon for the towelettes is similar to what I&#x27;ve seen in the stores, though with store rewards/coupons, you might save a little buying them at a big box store.</li>
    <li> I got these towels thinking they would be just as great as all the other PONDS products I&#x27;ve tried over the years. Unfortunately, I was wrong. Not only did they not entirely remove all the makeup but it left my skin feeling puckered. It took two towels to get all my makeup off when normally with every other brand I&#x27;ve used it only takes one. I&#x27;m keeping these simply as a back up in case I run out of my regular brand. I wasn&#x27;t too impressed :-/</li>
    <li> I liked these facial towelettes because they left my skin feeling not only clean, but smooth. There&#x27;s no stickiness, as is a film was left behind as it is drying, either. There&#x27;s not much of a scent, which is what I prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I did not like about it was the actual towelette. The towelette itself is like lace with openings. This is supposed to make it textured, but I found it too thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a nice towelette to clean your face when you don&#x27;t want or need to deep clean.</li>
    <li> I actually had to put some makeup on to test this properly. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are big fluffy textured towels, quite wet with a cleanser that foams when rubbed. This gives the disturbing impression of rubbing soap all over your face and then... leaving it there. But actually it seems to wipe off pretty clean. The textured bumps are good at scrubbing off makeup (and probably other things that don&#x27;t show up so easily on the white cloth.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cloths are very heavily perfumed, but the scent doesn&#x27;t linger, so I didn&#x27;t mind much. They left my skin feeling clean, but not dried out. Tolerable even without additional moisturizer. Obviously, actually washing and moisturizing is going to be better for your skin on a daily basis, but this is much better than nothing. They&#x27;re ideal for travel, or the occasional late party night when you just want to get the make-up off and collapse into bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not that I would know anything about that. Just guessing here. ;)</li>
    <li> Cleans my face when I need it in a pinch and leaves no residue! I&#x27;ve never broken out with this stuff and will continue to use it. Only complaint, if it&#x27;s really even considered one, is that the wipes are really wet and soapy feeling but it dries quickly.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Ponds Luminous wipes and cleansing cream I reveived from Bzzagent.com and I think they are amazing. They leave my face clean and free of makeup, without leaving my skin dry.  They have a light clean floral scent.  I would recommend these to friends and family..</li>
    <li> I received a sample of these Towlettes as a Bzzagent, and could not be happier with them! The cloths are thick, and have a heavy-duty quilted texture which gently, but effectively, removes dirt and makeup. They are a perfect product for an on-the-go mom, because no water is required! Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I love these towelettes! They are super refreshing and smell wonderful (smell is very important to me). I love finding a great product that I can recommend to friends, and this is definitely one of them. I tried the cream cleanser as well, and really like it, but I prefer the convenience and ease of these towelettes. Way to go Pond&#x27;s, you&#x27;ve done it again!    #gotitfree  #buzzagent    Got this for free as a buzzagent ([...])! Love being an agent!</li>
    <li> I got this product free from BzzAgent. I love this product.  I have tried many facial towelettes.  This has been my favorite so far. It left my skin feeling refreshed and very clean. It also left my skin very soft.  My skin can be sensitive and this did not irritate it at all. The smell is very refreshing. I would definitely recommend trying these products! They also fit great in your purse. :)</li>
    <li> I use the POND&#x27;S Luminous Clean Wet Towelettes to remove my makeup. Instantly I was in love with the smell. It is so fresh and light. The towelettes were soft (which was great) however they were a little too wet for my taste. The packaging stated that there was no need to rinse after using but I had to. I still enjoyed using this product. I felt like my face was clean and there was no need for me to use any additional cleansers - just a warm wash cloth.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product because, althogh it does not remove makeup that good it left my face feeling soft and clean. It is very convinient, fits in my purse and very easy to use. This is a keeper. Totaly recomend it.[[ASIN:B0089JVDPK Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean Wet Towelettes, 30Count]]</li>
    <li> Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean wet cleansing towelettes are a convenient, quality face wipe.  The thick, textured cloth actually feels like you are washing your face, rather than applying product to your face like many other wet face wipes that are smooth textured. They feel, and smell, quite luxurious. (I really love the way they smell!)&lt;br /&gt;I have been a user of Oil of Olay wipes for a long time now, but I have to admit, I prefer the texture of the Pond&#x27;s wipes. I also use Pond&#x27;s Rejuveness anti-wrinkle cream and very much like how the Pond&#x27;s products work together.&lt;br /&gt;The Luminous Clean cream cleanser is a pretty standard cream cleanser product. It goes on very smooth and also smells so pretty. It rinses off easily, which other cleansers sometimes fail to do. It is a very gentle cleanser that was very effective at lifting extra oils from the skin but not drying the skin out; rather, leaving it fresh and moisturized. My skin felt smoother and pores tighter.</li>
    <li> The New Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean Cream Cleanser and the Pond&#x27;s Wet Cleansing Towelettes is a must have.Thanks to Bzz Agent, I was lucky enough to participate in the Pond&#x27;s BzzCampaigns.I had the biggest pimple on my face right beteew my nose and lip area (what a better time to arrive),as well as makeup to cover the pimple.The first thing I did was, pull out the wet cleansing towelettes and start wiping my face. I&#x27;d notice a feeling of this tingling sensation on my face and, not a bad feeling a smoothing sensation so, I had to go look and the mirror and;with one towelette.I&#x27;d taken all the make up off (woohoo money saver).Later that night I took a shower,I&#x27;d applied the cleanser cream on my face. I let the cleanser set on my face then I rinse my face last. The next morning that big pimple.I spoke about earlier was dried out and nothing but a scab.After three days of using both of these Pond&#x27;s products my11 year old son came up to me and said.\\&quot; Mom are you getting lighter or something\\&quot; I said why,I look lighter?\\&quot;He said yes,but you look light in a nice way\\&quot; I&#x27;ve have, had problem with acne and dark spots,I used this products for about five days now,not even a full week and I&#x27;ve seen changes.My face now soft, the dark spots are fading away my face has a natural glow,the cream cleanser has the texture of a Mask or Clay but not as heavy, when on the face,I love the soft scent (it&#x27;s not a overwhelming scent)I love this product and I&#x27;ll keep buying and telling everyone,I know about this product especially if they have embarrassed skin moments like myself,I also wanna let y&#x27;all know I&#x27;d used Pond&#x27;s once daily to get the result I&#x27;ve gotten.I didn&#x27;t know about Pond&#x27;s and how great their products really are, I don&#x27;t need a monthly subscription that&#x27;ll cost me $400.00 a year.I&#x27;ve found something way better and,the cost is lesser. Thanks again to Bzz agent as well as thanks to Pond&#x27;s for creating such a great product at an affordable price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used alot of towelettes claiming to clean your face and exfoliate at the same time only to be disappointed. But I must say this is an awesome product and I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical about using these because other face towelettes I&#x27;ve used have left my skin either dried out or sticky - I do NOT like feeling sticky! I was pleasantly surprised that these towelettes didn&#x27;t do either! One towelette is more than enough to clean my face and neck and it leaves my skin feeling soft and clean! The towelette actually looks dirty after I use it so I know it&#x27;s actually cleaning my face. These are great to keep in my gym bag because then I don&#x27;t have to wash my face afterwards - I can just use a towelette! I use them sparingly, however, b/c I don&#x27;t have a lot of extra money to spend on things like this, so price can be a downfall for me, but they&#x27;re fairly reasonably priced for what they do! Overall I&#x27;d give them two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> I recently until now  was using the Neutrogena Deep Clean Facial Cleanser wasn&#x27;t really happy with it because it made my face dry and felt tight after washing my face, and had dry patches.  So I was happy when I received the Ponds Luminous Clean Cream Cleanser and Wet Cleaning Towelettes.  I loved the Ponds Luminous Clean Cream Cleanser and it made my face feel soft and had a heathy glow to it.  Also the Wet Cleansing Towelettes and they removed my eye makeup very well and had no bad reactions to either product even on my eyes.  The towelettes seal is very tight and don&#x27;t think I will have a problem with the seal lifting and the product drying out.  So very happy with the cleaner and towelettes and when the product runs out I will repurchase the items.  Would be good for anyone with normal, dry, or combination skin, however might be good for someone with oily skin due to the Kaolin Clay.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many cleansing cloths that promise to remove all the day&#x27;s grime without rinsing, but this is the first one that actually delivers on it&#x27;s promise!  On those nights when I&#x27;m too exhausted to stand, these are a face saver.  It gets off all my makeup without leaving a sticky residue.  My face is soft and clean, and it hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts or redness on my acne-prone skin.  My skin looks fresh in the morning.  Definitely a daily essential for this busy mom.</li>
    <li> I received this product as part of a BzzAgent campaign.  I was very excited to try the towelettes and was pleasantly surprised to see one wipe removed all the makeup from my face including all my mascara.  I normally need to use eye makeup remover to get mascara off after washing my face.  The wipes were very gentle and quick to use.  I plan on keeping some in my gym bag for after work outs.  I also received the Pond&#x27;s Luminous Cream Cleanser, which was very gentle and did not dry my skin out.  Great products!</li>
    <li> They have a GREAT smell to them..and do their job of removing make up well...also they have a neat texture that gently exfoliates too!</li>
    <li> These are not for me. I suppose they do the job just fine, but there is too much soap in them which leaves bubbles on my face. Too, I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell. I smell like I took a bath in lavender when I&#x27;m done.</li>
    <li> I am pretty simple in my &amp;#34;upkeep,&amp;#34; and don&#x27;t buy a lot of extras or unnecessary items, which I consider to be expensive luxuries.  With that in mind, I was glad to try these since I would probably never buy them on my own.  Right off the bat, I was delighted at the smell, texture and look of these facial cloths.  The smell is so perfectly fresh and mild, they feel soft, damp, and ever so slightly foamy, and the texture on the cloth can be described as open-weave or &amp;#34;lacy&amp;#34;. I enjoy using these facial wipes; they make my skin feel cleaner, softer and fresher when compared to straight washing, they are convenient, and have not bothered my eyes or sensitive skin.  I&#x27;m not sure if they are designed to remove makeup, but I experimented and they did remove my eyeshadow, light powder, and some mascara. Overall, these might be a nice product to have in your bathroom for a quck clean-up, but I probably wouldn&#x27;t use them daily.</li>
    <li> I used this for just cleaning my face when i&#x27;m on the go and it works good. Even though it does dry your skin out a little, it is a good product, even for men who don&#x27;t use makeup.</li>
    <li> I have tried several facial cleansers and this one is excellent.  It does not leave a dry feeling as do some of the others and there is no irritation in tender areas, even around the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with this product and will be ordering it when I have exhausted the very generous supply sent as an Amazon Vine promotion.</li>
    <li> i absoutely love the clean wet towellets, the smell of them are amazing like a soft perfume and the design on them is beautiful, it looks like live, they are also very durable i was stretching them and nothing happened.I love that ur able to close the package and u get 30 towelettes, it could last u a whole month :) The towellets lasted thru not only me using it but my 6 yr old daughter and 10 min after we used it, it was still reusable, and after using it i could see all the impurites that were on my face. I can see me using this all the time for not just taking of makeup butjust to refresh ur face, if u have oily skin like me ur face def needs refreshes a couple times a day and these are peferct, also right after working out, im just in love with these</li>
    <li> Have to say Ive used other non-rinse wipes before and havnt been thrilled but these Ponds wipes were great!! My favorite part about them is that they arent as \\&quot;scratchy\\&quot; as other wipes Ive used and that they didnt dry out my skin at all and considering Im dealing with a yucky New England winter right now that is a top priority for me!! Over all loved them and would buy them again! also on a side note being a busy mom with an already full diaper bag the package is smaller than other barnds and fit perfectly in a side pocket..just another added bonus!</li>
    <li> I like how the towelettes have little pockets in them. This make it feel like I was exfoliating my face while removing makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t think however that it removed some of the heavier makeup I was wearing.  I wear a lot of eye shadow (with primer), Mac eyeliner and mascara (non of it waterproof). Because of the pockets (which I liked on my face) it actually hurt to use for removing eye makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that neutrogena face wipes work better at removing eye makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if you don&#x27;t wear that much makeup and you mainly want it for use on your face, then this product is pretty good.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a cleansing towelette to throw in my gym bag.  I have found that most towelettes I have used in the past have left my face feeling tight and dry.  Of course, then I feel like I have to slather on loads of moisturizer.  Not with these little beauties!!  They leave my face feeling completely refreshed and supple.  I have been using these along with the Creme Cleanser in the evenings to remove my makeup and they are doing a wonderful job.  My skin is as soft and clear as ever.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product!!!! It made my face feel so soft and smooth without drying me out! It took off all my stubborn mascara and really cleaned my face. It was good for on the go also and nice to have when my makeup was a bit messed up, I would use the wipes to take it off, and then fix it without having to completely wash my whole face.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved the Pond&#x27;s towelettes! I used them throughtout the work day as well as while I was at a theme park. They are easy to just whip out, use and dispose. The package is kind of thick so you cant carry them in a small purse, but worth the buy. After using them my face felt so refreshed and radiant! If you&#x27;re looking for a great, quick way to feel refreshed throught the day, Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean towelettes is the WAY TO GO!</li>
    <li> I love the new Ponds Luminous wipes! They come in a convenient package that I can throw in my gym bag, my purse, or in my desk drawer to have them on hand. I&#x27;ve been using them for a week and they are great. They easily remove most makeup (except for stubborn waterproof mascara) and take off dirt. They leave my skin feeling soft and fresh. The scent is pleasant and they don&#x27;t dry my skin out like some other face wipes. Also great for those nights when you just don&#x27;t have the energy to wash your face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of all of the Pond&#x27;s facial towelettes so when I received these for free through BzzAgent.com, I thought this would be my favorite. Though I love the texture of the wipes I wasn&#x27;t in love with the fact that they were a bit on the drier side. However, I have been using them after the regular make-up remover towelettes and was pleasantly surprised. I really like the way they make my skin feel-soft and supple. Not dry or stretched which I sometimes get from the regular towelettes. The cleanser however is amazing.  It is very creamy, glides on smoothly, and foams up well.  My face feels totally clean after and I don&#x27;t feel that I have to apply moisturizer after.</li>
    <li> After trying many other brands, Ponds Luminous Clean Cleansing Towelettes get 2 thumbs up!&lt;br /&gt;Because I am one of those that hates to wash thier makeup off at the end of the day, I have tried many, many brands of cleansing towlettes and wipes and there are several advantages these have over others. I absolutely love the texture of them. They are really super soft and feel great on your skin, they dont feel harsh in the sensitive under eye areas but yet a very very durable. The scent is also a plus, not overpowering at all. They are absorbant and feel like they have eough product on each towelette my skin feels soft and hydrated after I use these and not dried out at all! These are also very large and can cover a big area. Since I am a heavy makeup user, I&#x27;ve used other wipes that were so small I had to use 2 or 3 to get all my makeup off. These come in a package of 30 so theres plenty to last you a while, and although it is a bit big for me to carry around in my purse, I will definitely be putting some of these in my travel trailer for when when go camping!</li>
    <li> I am not really a \\&quot;wipe\\&quot; person, but the convenience of these wet towelettes cannot be beat. At the end of the day I love taking one wipe and getting all the leftover makeup and dirt off of my face. The towelette is textured, so it cleans really well. The scent is light and I also like that I don&#x27;t have to rinse when I&#x27;m done. You can&#x27;t beat the convenience and I am loving the clean feeling.</li>
    <li> I was fortunate enough to receive samples of these products to review through BzzAgent and I’ve been pleasantly surprised. As a 40-something woman with a fair complexion and oily skin that seems to get more sensitive with each passing year I was a little concerned that this product might not work well for me- but boy was I wrong! I can’t speak to the “luminous” claims because I’ve never known my skin to be anything but greasy-looking with occasional to frequent breakouts. I will say, however, that my skin is definitely smoother since I started using these products, and the rosacea-esque areas on my face seem to be blending much better with the rest of my skin tone. The towelettes really make it hard to find an excuse to go to bed without removing my makeup, and the cream cleanser ranks as one of the best ones I’ve used in recent years. I can even tell if I’ve missed a spot because there’s an obvious difference in texture. I am truly impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some concerns I read about before trying this product involved the scent (which I personally find both soothing and refreshing), the tightness after use (which for me starts about 1 minute after use and only lasts a couple of minutes), and that it doesn’t fully remove some waterproof eye products (which is true, but I have yet to find a “gentle” daily cleanser that does). None of these are deal-breakers for me but are at least worth mentioning so you know what to expect. I have no hesitation recommending this to anyone, but we are all different so your results might not match mine. I still think it’s worth a try and I hope you like them as much as I do.</li>
    <li> Very good this product</li>
    <li> I love to travel with Ponds towelettes for cleaning my face. It packs much easier than liquid cleansers and does does a great job.</li>
    <li> Worked great didn&#x27;t dry out my face as some others have done. Got most of my eye makeup off which is a nice plus since it is not really for that purpose. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean Towelettes are probably the best makeup wipes I&#x27;ve ever used and I liked that it has keratin clay to remove the impurities. But they do seem hard to find in stores so your best deal would to buy these on here and enjoy them while you can.</li>
    <li> These towelettes are incredibly convenient! They also seem to hold more liquid than previous towelettes I&#x27;ve tried. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I love these towelettes! cleans very well i use these before and after I wash my face. (I like to know my face is free of yesterdays dirt)</li>
    <li> I truly like this wash for my face. It is soothing and very effective. A great item to use when I travel.</li>
    <li> My skin is oily--very much so. However, washing my face four or more times daily causes my skin to dry out. An alternative is using towelettes during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What attracted me most about Pond&#x27;s Wet Cleansing Towelettes (Luminous Clean) is one of the key ingredients is Kaolin clay. This ingredient is found in my favorite facial mask (LATHER White Clay Deep Pore Cleansing Mask--purchased here) and I&#x27;ve had awesome results with clearing up my acne issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are 30 towelettes in each package and each measures slightly less than 7\\&quot; x 6\\&quot;. Currently Pond&#x27;s has two types of towelettes with different ingredients as well as two different scents. There&#x27;s Original Fresh and this one, Luminous Clean that has a baby powder (ish) fragrance. These are perfect after a workout if you can&#x27;t get home to wash your face or shower. Also during the hot months. I keep a pack in my purse and one in my office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative is the Luminous Clean towelettes feel a bit on the soapy side. However, after my face dries, I don&#x27;t feel a residue. Also, I&#x27;ve had a chance to compare Pond&#x27;s to other brands and hands-down, this wins. Not only in results--which are better, but in price. Thanks to Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe and Save program, I&#x27;m able to currently purchase a pack for $3.97.</li>
    <li> I am a cook, at the end of the day I use these to get the grease and other impurities off.</li>
    <li> These are the only facial wipes I buy now! They&#x27;re the perfect mixture of strong enough to take off waterproof makeup and gentle enough not to irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have lots of allergies and sensitivities and am prone to acne. My skin loves these. I use one every night and I&#x27;ve never had any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part is that I don&#x27;t have to use water to wash off my makeup!</li>
    <li> These wipes did nothing for my face and I found them very lacking. I had to use 2 or 3 at a time to create enough foam and soap to wash my face. The towelettes are very skimpy and really don&#x27;t get the job done. I would stick with another cleanser or a soap instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katiebabs</li>
    <li> This is not the first Ponds product I have used over the years.  I have tried their other towelettes, all of which are great for removing makeup and dirt from your face.  I noticed the texture of the cloth with this particular product was a lot more softer than the ones I have used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love all the Ponds towelette products, and I think people will like these based on their personal taste in scents and sensitivity to one&#x27;s skin.  This specific item I think has the softest feel to it compared to the other Ponds towelettes I have used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this every night to take off my makeup.  I have noticed in the past that if you are not  careful about \\&quot;sealing\\&quot; the opening after taking one out, the towelettes will dry up.  My only complaint on these products is the seal, but other than that I  highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> I use towelettes every night to clean my face. I am also the person who loves to try new things so I am always trying different kinds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are by far my favorite ones that I have tried. My skin is super dry and in the winter anything and everything sends it into itchy flaky territory. These towelettes make my skin look smooth, even toned, and it has some sort of glow to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has no problem taking off my makeup. I don&#x27;t expect any towelette to be the miracle worker that can stand up to my mascara so I do use an eye makeup remover beforehand. All in all these are the best of the Ponds towelettes. They are not to harsh for my sensitive, dry, skin.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s start with the packaging...it&#x27;s pretty, convenient and easy to use. Good size for the value in both the cleanser and wipes. Now for the pro&#x27;s and con&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s - The smell of the cleanser and wipes is awesome! very fresh!&lt;br /&gt;The texture of the cleanser is silky, reminds me of said old school cleanser that used to come in a blue jar.&lt;br /&gt;When washing it goes on smoothly, rinses cleanly and did not make my skin feel dry, greasy or tight. My skin felt clean and soft.&lt;br /&gt;I love the wipes! Great smell and well and very convenient, great for removing makeup too. My skin also felt clean and soft, no dryness or tightness. I have adult acne and always am hesitant about using things on my face, and this product was great...definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> This was my first time to use Pond&#x27;s Luminous clean towelettes and I was very impressed!!  They have light wonderful scent to them.  When I used them, they worked wonderful at cleaning off my make up and any other build up.  They weren&#x27;t harsh on my skin and the texture felt wonderful.  You could see how well they were doing their job on removing all the build up during the day.  They were great to use at night time when you wanted to clean up real quick.  It was even gentle on my eyes!  They would be great on the go for when you need to be quick or even when you&#x27;re traveling around.  And I was impressed that it only took one towelette to clean my entire face.  I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> These are the best makeup wipes out there. So easy to use and picks up all the dirt and makeup from your face. Love that i don&#x27;t need to do anything but walk into the bathroom, open the package and start wiping. Makes my bedtime routine so much more convenient and simple. Smell amazing, much better than the typical brand of wipes i have used in the past.</li>
    <li> I have always been a fan of anything that makes my life more convenient. As a busy mom, sometimes I don&#x27;t have a lot of time to get ready in the morning, and I am exhausted at night trying to get ready for bed. I used towelettes already prior to receiving this product, and this was by far my favorite! The scent was great, and my face felt so soft afterwards! The clothes were soft and gentle, yet textured to help remove dirt and make-up. I gave this item 5 stars not only for the great quality, but also the convenience!</li>
    <li> I got my kit in the mail and started using it immediately. Within a few days i noticed my skin looked brighter and cleaner than it has in the past. It also made my skin feel really soft! Will definitely keep using this product in the future! I would recommend this product to anyone. You will definitely see results.</li>
    <li> Pleasantly Surprised!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging:  I love the fact that the cream cleanser comes in an easy to squeeze tube like bottle that stands up side down with a flip top cap, so there will never be a struggle to get the cleanser out of the tube.  The towelettes conveniently come in their own re-sealable pouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent/Texture/Dosage:  This cream cleanser has a light, clean, feminine scent that simply enhances the beauty ritual of face cleansing.  I must admit that I was reluctant to try this product due to its categorization of being a cream cleanser.  I am not typically a fan of these products because they lack the sudsy, foamy, scrubbing bubbles and tends to leave my skin with that not so clean feeling....but not this one!!!  I was pleasantly surprised to find that this pearly white \\&quot;cream cleanser\\&quot; actually does have a bit of thick, soft, fluffy foaminess to it.  You will only need about a nickel-sized dollop, as a little goes a long way.  The towelettes have the same light fragrance with a pre-moistened, pre-portioned, slightly textured soft cloth that creates and effortless and thoughtless face cleansing experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results: I was a bit frightened at first because I was beginning to breakout a bit during the first week.  I think that this was due to the product drawing out impurities, dirt and grime that were leaving my skin dull and pasty.  Not for long!  After using Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean Cream Cleanser and Wet Cleansing Towelettes, my combination skin was left feeling softer, smoother, clearer, and glowing with smaller pores.  However, my face did feel a tad tight so I made sure to follow up with moisturizer after each cleansing.  I washed my face twice a day with the cleanser (except for the times that I was feeling far too exhausted and lazy so I reached for the ultra convenient and equally effective towelettes.  (Don&#x27;t judge, you have all been there!)  I love that this product comes in to forms, the cleanser and the lazy girl toweletteso that you don&#x27;t have to veer from you regimen when your too tired to wash your face before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendation: Absolutely.  I would recommend this product for people with oily to combination skin and plan to continue using it myself.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t use many of these cloth brands since after use, my skin burns or tingles uncomfortably.  However, the clay in these seems to be soothing instead.  My face feels clean and exfoliated without the stinging.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my granddaughter&#x27;s first make up kit, and I decided to open and smell the product to see if she&#x27;s like the scent and to see if it would remove make up well.  LOVE the scent.  And it took off my make up -- and I wear a lot of the revlor colorstay that sets on your face and is hard to remove - - almost completely with one cloth.  I didn&#x27;t want to use a second cloth because I bought it for her, but now I think I&#x27;ll start using these for myself.  After using the cloth, I got in the shower and going through my usual make up removal routine, I barely got anything off.  My routine...a good natural soap with beneficial ingredients such as witch hazel, rose, orange, etc.  on a white face cloth so I can make sure everything comes off.  I follow up with pure organic coconut oil, rub it in good and remove with the cloth.  I usually get more off with this.  Then a nice moisturizing cleanser to finish.  As I said, I use a lot of make up to hide flaws, and this works well to remove my makeup and care for my skin.  I was very surprised at how much of my makeup came off with the towelette before I got in the shower.  And the scent is lovely.  Feels like it has moisturizer in it, so if you have oily skin, you&#x27;ll want a different formula.  But very good quality product.</li>
    <li> These work great, just as I expected them to do, and are such a bonus to have along on a trip.  So convenient, and so effective.</li>
    <li> It does an excellent job at removing my makeup! My skin feels clean after. I particularly love the texture of the towelettes which do a good job at cleansing without being ineffective or harsh on the skin. They are also very moist and thick. I would give this product 5 stars but, I&#x27;m not going to repurchase it (although I love it) because it contains DMDM Hydantoin as an ingredient {which is a formaldehyde releaser}</li>
    <li> It is d best thing if you are taking it with you on a warm day..removes d dirt.. Makes you feel fresh.. And has a mosturizer which is lovely !</li>
    <li> The towelettes are soft (too soft for my personal preference...I like a little more scrub feeling), and just right in terms of &#x27;wet&#x27;.  Not drippy, but not \\&quot;hey...looks like I need another because that one was half-dry\\&quot;.  I really like how well it took off my make-up, but I admit I prefer a little less soft &amp; more exfoliating feeling in a towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would buy for a quick wipe removal, particularly for my eye area, etc.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the Kaolin clay or something else, but these towelettes are very cool and soothing. Also, I&#x27;m prone to breakouts, and I had no trouble using these. They swipe that caked on eyeliner completely away. Another bonus is the quilted texture of the product. Normally, I use a generic (or Neutrogena) brand, and I&#x27;m used to a slightly rough, econo baby wipes texture. These are thicker and more soft and the scent isn&#x27;t to overpowering--very nice. LOVE.</li>
    <li> I found this product to be pleasant and gentle on very fair and sensitive skin especially around my eyes.  I wear eyeliner and mascara and removing it every night is tough on my skin. These towelettes remove it all without having to scrub.  The towelettes don&#x27;t foam or lather up, they are more of a makeup remover.  They seem to work better by using them first to remove the dirt, oil and makeup and then follow up with your favorite cleanser.  My only complaint is the packaging, it is a pain to open, the resealable plastic wears out and some of the towelettes eventually dried out.</li>
    <li> I use face wipes quite frequently.  I&#x27;ll admit that I am lazy and hate washing my face at the end of the day because the water makes such a mess.  These wipes are simple to use and are by far the best wipes that I have encountered - they take off everything and leave my face feeling super clean.  I love that they are textured - it almost feels like they exfoliate a bit when using them.  My skin is pretty sensitive and these do not dry it out or irritate it at all.  Will continue to use this brand.</li>
    <li> I like these Ponds Luminous Clean Wet Towelettes, especially for traveling.  I always feel bad about getting makeup all over someone&#x27;s white washcloths, whether I&#x27;m staying in a hotel or at someone else&#x27;s house.  These towelettes get *most* of my makeup off and leave my face feeling clean and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mascara&#x27;s another story, though, and I&#x27;m not even talking about waterproof.  Just regular mascara.  I tried using these towelettes exclusively a few nights, and even though it looked like it got my mascara off, when I&#x27;d wake up in the morning, I&#x27;d find that the mascara residue the towelettes left behind was now smushed all over, under my eyes.  That&#x27;s too bad.  But when paired up with a good mascara remover, these towelettes get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason, then, that I&#x27;m giving them four stars instead of five, is that the reason I&#x27;d buy this product is for the sake of convenience when I travel. In order not to have smeared mascara residue on my face the next morning, I need to pack a mascara remover and some cotton balls, along with these towelettes. That diminishes my convenience a little bit.  Otherwise, for travel, these are pretty great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Ponds Towelettes for years... they are great for removing makeup, a quick de-griming, or for times when I don&#x27;t have time for a shower but my face feels gross. They really do leave my skin clean, soft, and feeling fresh; they&#x27;re a staple in my bathroom and now my daughter uses them too.</li>
    <li> I really like the Ponds Wet Towelettes. I am in the gym and play sports all the time, plus I work late so it is very handy to be able to grab the packet and freshen up no matter where you are. There is a clean scent and because its from Ponds, you kind of know its easy on the skin. A good value.</li>
    <li> I love these cleaning clothes. They do not dry out my skin and I don&#x27;t even need moisturizer after I use them. Yet they clean off ally make up. They are great.</li>
    <li> These were one of the best purchases I have made! I have dry, sensitive skin, and these have done wonders for me. Gentle on my skin, but they remove all my makeup and gunk in 1 wipe! They smell great, nice fresh scent. The towels are kinda quilted unlike most towelettes and are super durable. I am able to use 1 wipe on my entire face, neck, chest and arms. These are a definite repurchase for me!</li>
    <li> these are really good at removing makeup, even waterproff types.  They I use one a day and unlike other brands i have tried the last one is still wet 30 days after I opened the pack!</li>
    <li> The Pond&#x27;s Wet Towelettes are simple to use.  I have them in my gym bag and a package in my purse. The sent is great and the towelette it&#x27;s self is strong (and pretty).  I am excited to use these in the summer and on trips due to the size and ease of this product. Washing your face with out water is the best. If I only had these in my college days, never would I have gone to bed and thought \\&quot;OH No!!! I didn&#x27;t wash my face\\&quot;. With these on your night stand you can do it in bed!!!</li>
    <li> I recently got a free sample of these towelettes, and I must say, they are very convenient and useful. I keep them on hand in my purse for throughout the day use. I imagine they are especially handy for when you have to run around doing errands in the summer months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also work very well to remove make-up, and didn&#x27;t leave any residue behind. They have a very light, pleasant scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend them!</li>
    <li> I love how the cream is not oily or greasy.  It made my skin feel fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The towelettes were soft and not abrasive.  Easy to put in your purse or bag and have on hand when you need to clean your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, my face feels and looks more radiant :)  Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean smells great too!!</li>
    <li> After work, I usually work out or I tan (sometimes both).  The Ponds Luminous Clean towelettes are great when I am on-the-go.  They have a slight texture that makes me feel like I am getting a deeper clean than some other cleansing or make-up remover towelettes I have tried in the past.  However, they are also gentle enough to remove my eye make-up.  They have a light, pleasant scent, but did not burn my eyes or irritate my skin.  Overall, I really like the towelettes and will probably purchase them in the future.  The cleanser was also nice and worked great in the shower with my Clarisonic.  Although, I will probably stick to my old cleanser.</li>
    <li> Pond&#x27;s is a well known company that has been around for a long time so I was super excited to try these new products :)&lt;br /&gt;I got two of each of these lovely products: Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean Wet Cleansing wipes and cream cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser has a soft and creamy texture, smells amazing with a soft clean feminine scent, not powerful at all.. it&#x27;s just right. It cleanses well without drying out your skin.&lt;br /&gt;The cleansing wipes remove makeup better than any wipe I have ever used. Unlike many makeup removers, it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling oily. However, it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin. Both of these products are superb in their quality and I will be purchasing them in the future. I highly recommend these great products. This is my own honest opinion. I&#x27;m a bzzagent and received these products for free for sampling. Thanks Pond&#x27;s and Bzzagent!</li>
    <li> I really loved the Pond&#x27;s Towelettes. Sometimes throughout the day, I get oily skin and I used these towelettes to freshen up my face. They worked like a charm! My face felt and looked clean and I noticed how soft my skin felt as well. I also used the towelettes to take off my makeup and they worked pretty good. Even took off my mascara. The towelettes have a fresh/clean smell that isn&#x27;t overpowering. Since the package is small, it fit in my purse without taking up lots of room so that I can use them on the go if I need. I&#x27;m going to buy and use this product again. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I received the ponds luminous facial cleanser and wipes from BzzAgent for review:I am loving the pond&#x27;s luminous facial wipes.....it cleans the skin, does not irritate (I have sensitive skin), and are thick wipes like a cloth. the wipes are better than any other brand I have tried---definitely a product i plan on using for as long as available.....the facial cleanser is an OK cleanser does the job but for me the wipes are the star in this line!!</li>
    <li> After several weeks using this product I noticed nothing of what it claimed other than squeaky clean skin.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t see any difference in my skins luminosity or brightness level. I will say that the Luminous clean towelettes were very user friendly and perfect for the gal on-the-go or dead tired! I would recommend them for everyday cleaning but not if you want to see a difference in the brightness of your complexion!</li>
    <li> Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean Wet Cleansing Towelettes are amazingly convenient. I love that you don&#x27;t need water. They leave your face with that same glow that the Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean Cream Cleanser does but in a convenient on the go version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice that the towelettes dried my skin out a bit more than the cream cleanser but I also have extremely dry skin in the first place due to my eczema. They still did not dry my skin out as bad as most cleansers have and I have tried a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought that maybe this would be something I would want to pack in the diaper bag for those out and about trips to the zoo or jogging/hiking with my kids for those hot summer days when you just want to get rid of that sweaty feeling over your face. So I decided after my morning workout I would try these to see if they cooled me off and cleanse me nicely without too much drying.  I felt so good after using a towelette that I decided I would have to try taking them next time I go out and know I will get sweaty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These would also work great for those moments like a prom or wedding when you mess up your make-up and need to clean your face but don&#x27;t want to get your water and soap on your fancy dress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since they did dry my skin out more than the cream cleanser I only gave them a 4 out of 5 but otherwise love these!</li>
    <li> I love these towelettes! They make my skin feeling light and fresh and takes off my eye makeup so easily. I love the scent, it is very soft and subtle and not strong or overbearing. I love the idea of having them on the go, maybe make single smaller packs to throw in your bag or gym bag? I have used them after gym sessions just to get a wipe down after working out. If you haven&#x27;t tried these you should! They are way better than any other brand i&#x27;ve tried!</li>
    <li> #GotItFree from Bzz Agent.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t particularly care for the towelettes but I did like the cream cleanser. The towelette had to be moistened with warm water in order to be effective. The cleanser had a nice smell, goes on smoothly, and makes your face feel squeaky clean without overdrying. In fact, my face felt soft and smooth.I don&#x27;t typically use Pond&#x27;s products but I would consider using this product again.</li>
    <li> I loved Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean Wet Cleansing Towelettes! They make my nighttime beauty cleanup routine a breeze!! I will definitely use this product again!</li>
    <li> At first I thought that the cleansing towelettes were just like all the other products out there. After two days, I was proven wrong. My face was softer and visibly cleaner. The towelettes removes waterproof mascara easily and doesn&#x27;t have a strong perfume smell that can irritate your eyes. The package is a little big to carry in your purse for on the go use, but I put a few in a Ziploc baggie and they are great to use after a long day of grocery shopping and running errands!</li>
    <li> I really the the Pond&#x27;s Luminous clean wet cleansing towelettes. They are great for work, working 12 hour days in a factory, they are great for a quick freshen up. They don&#x27;t dry my skin out. I will definitely be making this my new skin care line.</li>
    <li> I have tried a million variations of face towelettes and I have to say this are topping my list right now.  They removed my eye makeup with no trouble and they didn&#x27;t strip my skin of moisture.  The texture of the clothes was nice too, I think it helped to get my makeup off with less effort so I didn&#x27;t have to rub which can create irritation.  Great product overall!</li>
    <li> When I received this product for free for me to use and review, I was kind of skeptical. I have used many other face wipes but they always seem to dry my face a lot.I have very sensitive skin to the point that even organic products can cause my face to break. But the second day I started using pond&#x27;s clean wet towelettes. I could tell the difference in face.  I was hooked.  They smell very pleasant and they are very convenient. they fit right in your purse and seal perfect. my face feels smooth and clean. I did feel that my face was a bit dry not as much as other wipes so after using the towelettes I apply pond&#x27;s Luminous moisture . I love this product and I will keep on buying it.</li>
    <li> I received these as part of a Bzz Agent campaign &amp; LOVE them.&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive, combination skin along with occasional psoriasis outbreaks that can be caused by face products &amp; the Ponds towelettes treated my tricky skin wonderfully. The towelettes are large cloth like squares with a raised, textured pattern that did a great job exfoliating &amp; cleaning my skin. I&#x27;ve been able to take off waterproof mascara &amp; lip stain along with various other make up products with \\&quot;staying power\\&quot; without scrubbing which is great because my skin gets irritated way too easily. And I don&#x27;t really enjoy walking around with a red, raw face!!&lt;br /&gt;They best part about these towelettes is I can toss a pack in my bag &amp; freshen up while I&#x27;m on the go. The humidity in South Fl is brutal on my somewhat oily skin, even in the winter &amp; there are many days I don&#x27;t wear makeup so my face often shines &amp; I find using these while I&#x27;m out gets rid of the oil slick without drying it out &amp; refreshes me.</li>
    <li> I used these after I had surgery because I couldn&#x27;t shower for the first few days and still use them on the areas around the incisions because I still can&#x27;t get them wet and they work great!</li>
    <li> These towelettes provide just enough lathering and softness to make your face feel extremely fresh and clean after using them! In addition, they leave your face feeling shiny and soft so I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> Love these face wipes! They come in handy for EVERYTHING! I love how these are not too fragrant but they have a pleasant smell to them. It&#x27;s very refreshing. A must buy!</li>
    <li> These wet towelette&#x27;s were just okay. They didn&#x27;t seem to clean my face very thoroughly and they didn&#x27;t seem as soft and gentle as some others I have used.</li>
    <li> The pack comes with 30 moistened towelettes. It only took one wipe to get a deep clean. It is surprisingly moisturizing and didn&#x27;t leave my face dry nor irritated. It did a great job getting thick mascara off. The resealing pack doesn&#x27;t stay completely closed, but the cloths haven&#x27;t dried out.</li>
    <li> I love these towelettes.  These do an incredible job of cleaning off makeup.  I wear some pretty thick mascara sometimes and I find that these towelettes do the job.  I also like how they smell, their scent isn&#x27;t too strong, but rather they have a very nice and pleasant smell.  I love that these towelettes are fairly thick and of a good size, you don&#x27;t worry if you are going to run out of a towelette before you run out of makeup.  These are some of the better towelettes that I have tried.  Perfect for when you don&#x27;t want to wash your face the traditional way.</li>
    <li> Pond&#x27;s Luminous Towelettes have a nice, light scent.  The are a generous in size and made of a sturdy, quilted material.  They clean my face thoroughly but are gentle and do not dry out my skin.  My only complaint is they do not fully remove waterproof mascara.</li>
    <li> I seem to be allergic to everything, so it hard for me to find products I like that my skin like also. This wipes are just the trick. The wipe is big enough to remove a day&#x27;s worth of makeup and grime. The scent is light and pleasant. My face feels great after use and I can&#x27;t imagine traveling without them!</li>
    <li> I am absolutely in love with this product! It knows how to get to the hard spots and most of all it makes your face feel so clean. When I used this product I was so excited because it left my skin feeling so soft and it smelled great. I went to bed happy knowing that my makeup was off completely because you can see what was left on your face because the towelettes are white. The texture of the towelettes also made it easier to get to the tough spots!</li>
    <li> I love this!!!!!!! I have been using the towelettes on my face  at night and the Luminous cream cleanser in the morning for almost a week.  I have combination skin and in my mid twenties I started having very bad acne. I never suffered with it as a teenager you know a few here and there, but that was it. I couldn&#x27;t find a product for my skin one either made my face to dry or to oily. But bravo Ponds bravo!! My skin is clearing up and I,m not to dry. I live in upstate New York and we have had a cold rough winter. My face feels and looks great. They are really not exageratting when they tell you it pulls all the impurities from your skin. Oh and the best part the towelettes are great on the go and very purse friendly. Big thank you Ponds I haven&#x27;t felt this good about my skin in a very long time.</li>
    <li> Having something in the car, or in my purse for quick, easy clean up sounds like a winner to me.  I wasn&#x27;t as sold on the towlettes as the face wash due to the soapy residue I felt like I couldn&#x27;t get rid of but, if you are in a bind they are very convenient.</li>
    <li> I received the Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean Wet Cleansing Towelettes to try as a Bzz Agent. I also received the Cream Cleanser, but haven&#x27;t tried it yet.&lt;br /&gt;I had a full face of makeup and used one towellete, thinking I would probably need 2 of them to remove all my foundation and eye makeup.&lt;br /&gt;There is a little bit of texture to the towelette as well as a nice soft fragrance. One towelette was all I needed to remove everything! Even with mascara and eyeliner! My face was soft and clean and barely any residue when I went over it with toner.&lt;br /&gt;I know I should have used the cream cleanser first but it was late and I was lazy. I am definitely including the Pond&#x27;s Cleansing Towelettes into my night-time routine!</li>
    <li> I must say that I was pleasantly surprised by these towelettes.  Typically towlettes can be harsh on my skin and when used around my eyes cause a lot of irration.  These however, did not.  They removed ALL of my makeup (including waterproof masacara and eyeliner) without giving me any irritation.  I like that the towelettes are grooved which helps remove all that day old makeup, yet they are not abrasive on my skin.  I would highly recommend these for on the go scenarios (traveling for work, weekend getaway, camping, etc) as there is no need to wash with water afterwards.  Also - they leave your skin feeling moisturized so there is no need to carry a bunch of products!  Oh and one more thing - the scent is very pleasant and clean (maybe not a scent I would choose - but easy to deal with).</li>
    <li> I received this and immediately tried the towelettes. They come 30 in a pack and do clean very well. They wipe off makeup easily and as long as you close the package well so they stay wet. I do not see any difference in brightness in skin but my face feels nice not tight after using and I did not have to utilize as much moisturizer as I usual do. The wipes are convenient and easy to toss in your purse for on the go. They are soft wipes that are large sized. I wish they came in bigger packets.</li>
    <li> these are great for on the run and also great for when your to lazy to get out of bed to wash your face!</li>
    <li> The towelettes are wonderful, there is a very light fragrance, the texture of the cloth is soft and non-abrasive.  I like using it in the morning since my skin gets a slight luminous glow even without using a luminizer.  The cloth cleaned well and left a nice hydrated feel on your skin.  I also noticed that it evens out skin tone.  I had some dark patches this winter and my skin was looking dull, using this helped lighten the small dark patches from a pimples drying out.</li>
    <li> The first time I used the wet cleaning wipe it made my face very soft. It has helped my skin to feel clean but not dried out.  My sister used the cleaning clothes to remove her make-up and she said that it makes her face feel clean and the pores feel cleaner also. I like that the cleaning clothes don&#x27;t make my face feel greasy afterwards.  I love that I can throw these in my purse to clean my face before going out. I wouldn&#x27;t use this in place of a cleanser, but it is nice for removing make up and for when you need to quickly wash your face.</li>
    <li> I had never used this product even though I am a Pond&#x27;s fan.  I found that they are wonderful to take on trips, which cut down on a jar of cleanser. I have very sensitive skin and several allergies. Mild fragrance, gentle to skin, yet does a thorough cleansing, made my luggage lighter. They did an excellent job of cleansing without leaving the skin dry or greasy. I do not use all the time at home but use the regular Pond&#x27;s Cold Cream twice a day.</li>
    <li> I love using this product when I get home after a night out and I want to get off all of my makeup before I go to sleep.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s face it:  as our skin ages, it gets very sensitive, especially on our faces.  There are a lot of good products out there that I used to use, but now they irritate the heck out my skin.  In recent months, I have found myself drifting back to to the old, reliable Ponds brand.  I tried their night cream, and found it to be just as good as some of the significantly more expensive brand, yet it still leaves my skin soft, smooth, and well hydrated...without irritation.  So I jumped at that chance to try the POND&#x27;S LUMINOUS CLEAN WET TOWELETTES.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And let me tell you, I am very glad that I did!  POND&#x27;S LUMINOUS CLEAN WET TOWELETTES clean my skin thoroughly, leaving no trace of make-up.  They give me a soft, rosy, healthy glow, with no bumps, itching, or dryness.  When paired with the Pond&#x27;s night cream, I can honestly say that my skin has a clearer, more youthful appearance. The scent is light and pleasing, and the extra-large size ensures enough surface area for a complete clean.  I am extremely happy with POND&#x27;S LUMINOUS CLEAN WET TOWELETTES.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used POND&#x27;S LUMINOUS CLEAN WET TOWELETTES while traveling and at home.  In both situations, my skin feels healthier and happier.  I can definitely recommend POND&#x27;S LUMINOUS CLEAN WET TOWELETTES.</li>
    <li> At night, I have been using the Wet Cleansing Towelettes to remove make-up and to clean my face before heading off to bed.  The cloths themselves are velvety soft and very gentle to the touch.  They do not have the same pleasant floral fragrance as the cream cleanser but still a better fragrance than most towelettes that I have tried. I have used the towelettes according to the directions on the package.  Although my face felt clean, the towelettes don&#x27;t totally remove all of my light make-up especially the eyeliner and mascara.  I was assuming I would see the impurities in the towelette, as the product states it acts like a magnet to draw out the impurities, (think stridex pads) which I did not. This product did not leave my skin burning or stinging; it did leave my face feeling cool and refreshed. For a quick clean, I think this product works well.  However, I prefer Pond&#x27;s Cleansing Cream to the Towelettes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheryl&lt;br /&gt;Bzz Agent</li>
    <li> I love these products!  They smell SO good. I&#x27;ve always been a fan of facial cleansing wipes.  These ones by Ponds Luminous Clean are my new favorite!  The texture of them is awesome, and they are thick and sturdy.  I was a surprised that they are moisturizing but don&#x27;t irritate my eye area.  My face felt moisturized but really clean after I used it.</li>
    <li> I travel often for work and it is so hard to find good products that aren&#x27;t hard to pack. The towelettes are perfect for traveling. They can be used as a makeup remover, face cleaner or both. They are so handy to have around. I love the way my skin feels after using these.</li>
    <li> The Ponds towelettes smell great. Since you don&#x27;t have to rinse after using them they are great for the on-the-go woman.</li>
    <li> I am loving these wet cleansing towelettes! The first thing I noticed about them was their light, fresh, and clean scent. They are extremely durable and 1 towelette is enough to remove all of my makeup. They are not as moist as other towelettes, but in my opinion, I believe this is positive aspect of the product. I hate when they are sopping wet and drench not only my face but half my shirt. They are textured which helps to remove the makeup that has settled on my face. They remove the oil without leaving my skin dried out. I have tried many brands of makeup towelettes but I believe I may have found my favorite!</li>
    <li> I loved the Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean Products. I never used towelettes before and thought I wouldn&#x27;t like them, but they were great. They smelled awesome and took all of my make up right off. Very easy to use and great to use on the go! Even my roommate, who is really picky about face products, asked to use them once and hasn&#x27;t stopped using them since.&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser felt great as well! I will definitely use these products in the future!</li>
    <li> I went out with some friends last night, so I loaded up pretty heavily with make up. When I got home at 1am I used the Luminous Clean wipes to take it all off. I only needed one wipe and in the morning I woke up and my face felt like I hadn&#x27;t put any makeup on the night before. It&#x27;s really convenient to get all that stuff off quickly and cleanly when I&#x27;m tired and just ready to get into bed. I&#x27;m also like how they smell nice and gentle while your using them, but the smell doesnt stay on your face like it does with some other wipes.</li>
    <li> I am a bzz agent and I got to try out the Ponds wet cleansing towelettes and I have to say they are amazing. They leave your face feeling clean and moisturized. Ponds towelettes come in a small package so u can take them everywhere with you. They are resealable so they don&#x27;t dry out. I have dry skin and they help keep my face glowing and soft. If you use makeup they are remove makeup very easly. Pond wet towelettes also smell great. I love the smell. Keeps your face smelling fresh. I would recomand this product.</li>
    <li> This weekend I went camping with several young girl scouts.  We had one sink for 14 people.  The Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean Wet Towelettes were a life saver.  After hiking through the muddy woods, I was able to clean the grime off my face without running water.  It is amazing how clean you feel when you can wash your face.  In the past, I have come home from camp with blotchy greasy skin from lack of washing for several days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thankful I can return to my daily life without clogged pours and acne.  I will always travel with these towlettes from now on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received both the Pond&#x27;s towelettes and the cream cleanser as part of the BzzKit.  I am truly impressed with the value and benefits of both.</li>
    <li> First off let me say that most facial washes break me out! I&#x27;ve been using this the last couple of days and my face is looking better! The towelettes I use at night to take my makeup off.  They have a very nice smell, reminds me of something just can&#x27;t put my finger on it.  When using the facial wash I don&#x27;t feel the need to moisturize afterwards as much as I did before.  Will continue to use this product!</li>
    <li> I have been using this in addition to my ProActive treatment. Works great as a make-up remover and has not made my skin breakout.The textured wipes rock! These are some of the best wipes I have used, the surface is VERY textured so some may find that irritating but I think it really gets off the last bit of eye make-up and foundation after I get out of the shower. Took them with me to my make-up trial run this week before my wedding, worked great to clean off make-up between applications!</li>
    <li> forever fan.. even better when you add johoba oil perfectly removes makeup the nice way</li>
