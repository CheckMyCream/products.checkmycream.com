      <li>I love this lotion!</li>
      <li>Within minutes, her cheeks looked visibly better!</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t the traditional baby smell lotion, but it does smell great, works perfectly alternating with the apricot oil after bath.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Burts Bees was bought by Clorox and now Clorox is making environmental safe products.  </li>
      <li>However, the bottle I received from Vitamin Shoppe does not have the pump top as shown in the picture</li>
      <li>I would love to know what&#x27;s causing it.  </li>
      <li>(it has a flip top lid).  </li>
      <li>But eventually, you&#x27;ll love the scent.</li>
      <li>This has to be my favorite moisturizing lotion of any I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
      <li>Not my favorite burts product and</li>
      <li>Why do companies that have such awesome products discontinue them?</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>The pump top would have been more convenient.</li>
      <li>Within an hour or so, they looked dramatically better.</li>
      <li>Now, I have to spend more money on antihistamine meds.  </li>
      <li>As if spit-up stains weren&#x27;t stylish</li>
      <li>Felt wierd on my skin and you can better believe there was no way I was putting it on my child.  </li>
      <li>This is fantastic lotion!</li>
      <li>Normally I love the Burt&#x27;s products, but this one is a huge no for my kiddos!  </li>
      <li>We were up most of the night with my child.</li>
      <li>The pump bottle may no longer be available as they don&#x27;t show up even on the Burt&#x27;s Bees website, so Amazon, please change the picture!</li>
      <li>and it works much better than using diaper rash cream alone.</li>
      <li>Skin is clean, soft, and smells great!  </li>
      <li>Nice smell, fresh and not overpowering.</li>
      <li>It smells heavenly, it massages through the skin nicely and my baby&#x27;s skin is so soft and nicely moisturized.</li>
      <li>It only seems strong at first, besides when it has already been absorbed by my baby&#x27;s skin, it makes him smell really nice and delicious!</li>
      <li>And the scent has already found its way into my olfactory \\&quot;nostalgia\\&quot; bin, so anytime I smell anything like it, I&#x27;m flooded with sweet thoughts of my precious baby girl.</li>
      <li>Works just fine on me.  </li>
      <li>But the smell is very strong, my husband dislikes it very much.  </li>
      <li>I am a huge fan.</li>
      <li>Huge mistake</li>
      <li>Overall great product for winter.</li>
      <li>I filled it into a pump container instead.</li>
      <li>and it is kind of watery which makes it runs out fast...</li>
      <li>(which probably means it really is too strong!)</li>
      <li>Great for a child with dry skin.</li>
      <li>I really hope it looks better in the morning</li>
      <li>Those who rated it low mostly commented on its smell...to be honest, when I used it for the first time, I was also put off by its \\&quot;strong\\&quot; scent.</li>
      <li>After he was released to full-on bath duty, we tried several popular products specifically designed for babies.</li>
      <li>It has a soft scent that makes applying it even more encouraging.</li>
      <li>For being so natural, clearly many children are having this reaction.  </li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll probably say it&#x27;s quite strong at first and that the scent is too much for you.</li>
      <li>You can put your finger right in the product by unscrewing the lid.</li>
      <li>Just apply the right amount</li>
      <li>It is organic right?   </li>
      <li>I love that they are accountable for the exact percentage of natural vs synthetic ingredients in each one of their products.  </li>
      <li>my husband says he wants to eat him!  </li>
      <li>It is NOT the cure (because sadly, that doesn&#x27;t exist), but it is one of the two best lotions we&#x27;ve found.</li>
      <li>and I really hope Burt&#x27;s Bees will do something about this situation because no child/baby should have to experience this!</li>
      <li>My baby&#x27;s skin is really soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>I will admit it works great, just cant get over the smell and the long lasting greasy effect.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>This was the first \\&quot;day time\\&quot; episode.</li>
      <li>This has a funny smell to it, and is very greasy.</li>
      <li>Baby Bee won out in the end because of it&#x27;s soft, sweet smell.</li>
      <li>He&#x27;s one smart cookie.</li>
      <li>My 2 year old&#x27;s skin is very sensitive and my mother used it thinking it was ok because it&#x27;s natural and hypoallergenic.</li>
      <li>Please be aware that this lotion can be highly allergenic for babies and toddlers.</li>
      <li>It really</li>
      <li>Now they have soap w/ this buttermilk scent, but I really miss the lotion.</li>
      <li>The smell is gentle but somehow it is not my type of scene</li>
      <li>And I swear he loves it as much as I do.</li>
      <li>It moisturizes very well, and leaves no greasy feeling on your skin after it&#x27;s applied.</li>
      <li>I was ready to run him to the ER for fear that he was in danger of a some sort of severe allergic reaction.  </li>
      <li>I can feel good about putting this brand on my baby&#x27;s delicate skin.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not the traditional baby scent that we&#x27;re all used to, but I know that I will have sweet memories of this scent for the rest of my life.  </li>
      <li>I love Burt&#x27;s Bees lotion and all other Burt&#x27;s Bees products - they are all natural with none of the toxic substances that we are learning to watch out for.  </li>
      <li>Most of them were too harsh for his skin.</li>
      <li>When he woke up the next morning his skin was covered in bumps and severly red (his face was fine).</li>
      <li>(Gentle Naturals Baby Eczema Cream is the other, which we apply after the buttermilk lotion has been absorbed to seal it</li>
      <li>Like many other kiddos who have used this lotion, it causes my daughter (6) to break out into one giant patch of of hot, red itchy hives EVERYWHERE the lotion has touched.  </li>
      <li>From reading reviews here and on many other sites it seems like a lot of people have had a similar problem.  </li>
      <li>I originally purchased this for my newborn, and use it on my other children as well.</li>
      <li>I agree with him when I first put it on the babies, but once the night goes by, I do enjoy the slight smell that lingers for the next 2 days.  </li>
      <li>We tried EVERY product out there to moisturize her trouble spots, and had only moderate success here and there, but many of the products that worked still made her cry when applied during a flare up.</li>
      <li>As a new mother, I wanted to start my son&#x27;s life right - without additives such as parabens, alcohol and any unnatural ingredients to the products I use on his skin daily.  </li>
      <li>This came chunky and clearly expired.  </li>
      <li>It is a soft scent that still hints of childhood.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t, Baby Bees lotion is soothing and keeps baby&#x27;s skin feeling silky soft.  </li>
      <li>old</li>
      <li>Why would you put alcohol on sensitive baby skin?  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ll use it for me but use caution on young kids.</li>
      <li>BTW, I am 37 and not some baby with really sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>No mineral oils, natural product</li>
      <li>Stick with Aquafor, which keeps skin soft and we&#x27;ve never had a reaction to.</li>

    <li> I put this lotion every where on my son except his face when he got out of the bath. When he woke up the next morning his skin was covered in bumps and severly red (his face was fine). I have seen a lot of other people complaining of these same results. I was wondering if any one has found what they thought to be the culprit. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This has to be my favorite moisturizing lotion of any I&#x27;ve ever tried. It has a soft scent that makes applying it even more encouraging. It moisturizes very well, and leaves no greasy feeling on your skin after it&#x27;s applied. Try it; you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! Those who rated it low mostly commented on its smell...to be honest, when I used it for the first time, I was also put off by its \\&quot;strong\\&quot; scent. But as I continued to use it, I realized that the scent is \\&quot;acquired taste\\&quot;...you eventually will love it! Cos every time I use it now, I&#x27;m like god that smells awesome! It only seems strong at first, besides when it has already been absorbed by my baby&#x27;s skin, it makes him smell really nice and delicious! As a moisturizer, it is excellent! My 3-month-old son had tiny dry patches on his arms and legs due to the cold weather, but after applying this lotion for a couple days, it cleared up and his skin was smooth and soft again! Two thumbs up!! Don&#x27;t let the \\&quot;strong scent\\&quot; deter you, this is a safe and great lotion for babies!</li>
    <li> Well I tried it on my 3 year old son and he broke out in the terrible red rash as well.  I thought it was just something that would be a problem for him.  Now last night I used it on my 2 year old daughter and she had the same reaction.  Poor thing looks like she has been out in the sun for days.  I called the Burt&#x27;s to let them know about this and they gave me a case number and said that I could talk to customer service about it further.  We will see what they say.  They recommended that I take the bottle in to the pediatrician, and have my kids tested for allergies.  Normally I love the Burt&#x27;s products, but this one is a huge no for my kiddos!  Works just fine on me.  Spot test for sure!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion on my baby&#x27;s skin! Mind you, the smell is acquired taste. You&#x27;ll probably say it&#x27;s quite strong at first and that the scent is too much for you. But eventually, you&#x27;ll love the scent. It smells heavenly, it massages through the skin nicely and my baby&#x27;s skin is so soft and nicely moisturized. No allergy problems with it whatsoever and it&#x27;s not greasy at all. Just apply the right amount and hey, it has natural/organic ingredients! I find myself getting addicted to the scent, actually :)</li>
    <li> My son, 18 months, broke out in an terrible rash where I applied the lotion! It looked so very, very awful and he was clearly very uncomfortable where the bright, red, hot rash was.  He kept itching and it looked dreadful. Did I mention it looked painful?!! Sorry, but it was bad.  For being so natural, clearly many children are having this reaction.  The redness was very hot to the touch, and I would liken it to a very bad burn.  Great smell, but a terrible price to pay.  Ouch!!! I was ready to run him to the ER for fear that he was in danger of a some sort of severe allergic reaction.  I really hope it looks better in the morning and I really hope Burt&#x27;s Bees will do something about this situation because no child/baby should have to experience this!</li>
    <li> My 19 month old broke out in a terrible red rash after using this lotion.  6 days later and the redness is gone but he still is covered in bumps and uncomfortable.  From reading reviews here and on many other sites it seems like a lot of people have had a similar problem.  Be careful!</li>
    <li> I normally like Burt&#x27;s Bees products but my daughter (now 7) had a horrible allergic reaction to the Baby Bee Buttermilk Lotion.  She broke out in a raging red rash and hives everywhere the lotion was applied.  There are alot of ingredients so I&#x27;m not certain on what the culprit was.  It smells great and I&#x27;ll use it for me but use caution on young kids.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this for my newborn, and use it on my other children as well. Great for a child with dry skin. Nice smell, fresh and not overpowering. Very nice texture.Use sparingly! A little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> My daughter has had severe eczema since she was about 2 mos. old (she&#x27;s now 6 mos.). It&#x27;s especially bad on her cheeks and wrists/hands. We tried EVERY product out there to moisturize her trouble spots, and had only moderate success here and there, but many of the products that worked still made her cry when applied during a flare up. Plus, all of them were so greasy that a grease-splotch on my shoulder became a regular part of my daily look. As if spit-up stains weren&#x27;t stylish enough!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I heard about this buttermilk lotion and then happened to see it at a gift store. They had a tester bottle, so I applied some to her cheeks (immediately - no tears!) and decided to stroll a while to see what the results would be before I made a purchase. It was pretty expensive after all, and we didn&#x27;t need yet another bottle to collect dust in her \\&quot;rejected\\&quot; eczema armory. Within minutes, her cheeks looked visibly better! Within an hour or so, they looked dramatically better. I bought it and we&#x27;ve been using it ever since. It is NOT the cure (because sadly, that doesn&#x27;t exist), but it is one of the two best lotions we&#x27;ve found. (Gentle Naturals Baby Eczema Cream is the other, which we apply after the buttermilk lotion has been absorbed to seal it in).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion soaks in so quickly that it isn&#x27;t going to smear off like the others - and you only need a little bit, so it goes a long way. Plus it is the only product that never stings our daughter&#x27;s skin. And the scent has already found its way into my olfactory \\&quot;nostalgia\\&quot; bin, so anytime I smell anything like it, I&#x27;m flooded with sweet thoughts of my precious baby girl. I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> Not my favorite burts product and I am a huge fan. This has a funny smell to it, and is very greasy. I will admit it works great, just cant get over the smell and the long lasting greasy effect.</li>
    <li> This would have been the only lotion I bought for my kids if only I knew this when they were born. Their skin feels softer now ever since I started using it. The scent is great too!</li>
    <li> We tried everything to get my baby&#x27;s eczema to go away, less bathing, less chemicals, fancy lotions, everthing except hydrocortisone. When the rashes still didnt go away, our dr recommended hydrocortisone. As a last ditch attempt to not use that, we tried this burts bees lotion -- within 3 days the eczema my daughter had had for months cleared up! It really worked!!&lt;br /&gt;The only negative thing is I dont like the bottle it comes in, so hard to squeeze anything out of, and does not come with a pump. I filled it into a pump container instead.</li>
    <li> I broke out in a horrible itchy rash 4 hours after applying this lotion.  The rash is all over my body &#x27;cause I had used the lotion all over the body!  Now, I have to spend more money on antihistamine meds.  Please do a patch test before applying on your child.  BTW, I am 37 and not some baby with really sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> As the product states, this is for all ages - a lightweight lotion that wont sting dry and chapped skin yet still does it&#x27;s job! This lotion has a calming and comforting scent and leaves skin as moisturized and supple as a baby&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I like the consistency of this lotion - not too thick, not too thin.  But the smell is very strong, my husband dislikes it very much.  I agree with him when I first put it on the babies, but once the night goes by, I do enjoy the slight smell that lingers for the next 2 days.  (which probably means it really is too strong!)</li>
    <li> Burts Bees was bought by Clorox and now Clorox is making environmental safe products.  This lotion is soooo yummy, makes me want to just eat up my little one!  A little goes a long way also and not greasy.  I bought my lotion from a different seller and it didn&#x27;t come with a pump, which I don&#x27;t mind seems like I waste lotion when I get a pump with it!</li>
    <li> Like many other kiddos who have used this lotion, it causes my daughter (6) to break out into one giant patch of of hot, red itchy hives EVERYWHERE the lotion has touched.  In other words, head to toe.  I would love to know what&#x27;s causing it.  It has absolutely no effect on my other 2 kids, aside from smelling lovely.  :(  Has anyone figured out what causes this??</li>
    <li> Like many posters before me, this lotion causes my child to break out into a nasty, red, itchy rash where ever it has touched her skin.  It promptly has been put in the trash.    Please don&#x27;t subject your child to even a spot check for this reaction. It is not worth it!  We were up most of the night with my child. It is heartbreaking to see her in such pain.    I had received some of this lotion as a gift and just grabbed it last night.  Immediately after applying, she was a giant red rash.    Stick with Aquafor, which keeps skin soft and we&#x27;ve never had a reaction to.</li>
    <li> Smells great, no yucky ingredients.  Great for babies, and for moms, too.  However, the bottle I received from Vitamin Shoppe does not have the pump top as shown in the picture (it has a flip top lid).  The pump top would have been more convenient.</li>
    <li> You know how lotion stings your hands when they are REALLY dry?  We get very very dry skin in the winter in Alaska, and my kids hate having lotion applied because it hurts so bad.  Then we found Burt&#x27;s Bees Baby Bee lotion, and it doesn&#x27;t sting!!  This is fantastic lotion!</li>
    <li> NO Alcohol!!  Why would you put alcohol on sensitive baby skin?  Don&#x27;t, Baby Bees lotion is soothing and keeps baby&#x27;s skin feeling silky soft.  It isn&#x27;t the traditional baby smell lotion, but it does smell great, works perfectly alternating with the apricot oil after bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t regret getting Burt&#x27;s Bees Baby lotion for little miracle.</li>
    <li> My poor daughter broke out in a horrible thick red rash everywhere I put this lotion.  I am now reading that other mothers have had the same problem.  It does smell good though.</li>
    <li> I thought that by using a more natural product that I wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about my son having a reaction, but I was sadly mistaken.  After using this lotion my 3 month old son developed a contact rash which lasted for just over a month, which was very disappointing seeing as I was given quite a bit of Burt&#x27;s Bees products at my baby shower and now will not use any of them for fear of this happening again.  He was covered with red sores on his entire body after one use, and the poor guy was so uncomfortable!  After this happened I began reading negative reviews that other mother&#x27;s had written about this same product.  Never again!</li>
    <li> My mother found a bottle of this lotion given to us as a part of a gift set. My 2 year old&#x27;s skin is very sensitive and my mother used it thinking it was ok because it&#x27;s natural and hypoallergenic. I got home to see that my daughter had a HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE reaction. She has a rash from her neck down to her Pull-up. She cant sleep because of the discomfort.</li>
    <li> I personally have not used the Burt&#x27;s Bees buttermilk lotion.  I would however caution everyone to test a patch of skin before liberally applying.  You can be allergic to buttermilk without being allergic to other dairy products because of the fermentation process and the bacteria they add.  Powdered buttermilk (which is probably what is in this lotion) contains all kinds of plant derivatives.  Examples are corn, wheat, etc...  I have a really severe buttermilk allergy, and that red burning rash and hives seems to be very common for those who suffer the allergy.  Last time it happened to me, I ingested buttermilk ranch dip, and I had the rash and hives all over my body for 5 days.</li>
    <li> Please be aware that this lotion can be highly allergenic for babies and toddlers. Our 18-month old son has sporadically broken out in horrible rashes and hives over the last few months. The first time it happened, he woke up in the middle of the night screaming, covered in massive red welts that he had scratched bloody and raw. We have cut short vacations and have had to give our son prescription medications to combat the outbreaks and relieve my son from the itching, swelling and discomfort. We have also paid expensive co-pays at allergy clinics and to our pediatrician to try and figure out what was happening. We did not get any answers as to what was causing this severe reaction, which was happening only in the middle of the night AND only when we were out of town. We went through extensive allergy testing and treatment only to be told he wasn&#x27;t allergic to anything.     Because the cool weather is approaching, I used the last of my travel sample on our son one recent morning (as opposed to post-bath aquaphor) and about 5 hours later he had another massive itchy rash. This was the first \\&quot;day time\\&quot; episode. Through this trial and error I have come to realize it is Burt&#x27;s Bees Buttermilk lotion that is causing these horrible reactions. At this point, I am not sure what particular ingredient is the culprit. But there are a number of online forums with parents complaining about the same rash and hive reaction to the lotion.     I am usually a Burt&#x27;s Bees fan, but if you buy this product please do a patch test on your child.</li>
    <li> This came chunky and clearly expired.  Felt wierd on my skin and you can better believe there was no way I was putting it on my child.  Also it looked like it may have been tampered with.  Huge mistake</li>
    <li> I only use Baby Bees products on my daughter.  Skin is clean, soft, and smells great!  No mineral oils, natural product</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t pick this item, my newborn did. He&#x27;s one smart cookie. After he was released to full-on bath duty, we tried several popular products specifically designed for babies. Most of them were too harsh for his skin. The only ones that didn&#x27;t cause him to dry out or break out were Burt&#x27;s Bees Baby Bee and Aveeno. Baby Bee won out in the end because of it&#x27;s soft, sweet smell. And I swear he loves it as much as I do.</li>
    <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees lotion and all other Burt&#x27;s Bees products - they are all natural with none of the toxic substances that we are learning to watch out for.  My only problem with this particular product is that the pictures shows a PUMP bottle.  I bought two because I wanted pump bottles which are easier to use than pop-top bottles.  However, I received pop-top bottles.  The pump bottle may no longer be available as they don&#x27;t show up even on the Burt&#x27;s Bees website, so Amazon, please change the picture!</li>
    <li> My baby has some bumps on his elbow and knees. After using this and the baby body wash for 2-3 days, the bumps are gone. My baby&#x27;s skin is really soft and smooth. I apply a bit on baby&#x27;s bum bum too, and then apply diaper rash cream and it works much better than using diaper rash cream alone. Wonderful! The smell is gentle but somehow it is not my type of scene and it is kind of watery which makes it runs out fast... so it is a bit pricey. It is organic right?   Overall great product for winter.</li>
    <li> Who would buy something off a supermarket shelf nowadays that is not tamper resistant? You can put your finger right in the product by unscrewing the lid. I wrote to them and they told me that their customers wanted it that way so that they could &#x27;smell&#x27; the product (and sample it?) What ever happened to testers?</li>
    <li> My son has an awful itchy red rash from this!  Don&#x27;t use it!  I feel awful because he is so uncomfortable</li>
    <li> I am bummed and believe Burt&#x27;s stopped making this flavor, as I cannot find this scent anywhere. Was one of the best lotions I had ever used. Now they have soap w/ this buttermilk scent, but I really miss the lotion. Why do companies that have such awesome products discontinue them?</li>
    <li> As a new mother, I wanted to start my son&#x27;s life right - without additives such as parabens, alcohol and any unnatural ingredients to the products I use on his skin daily.  I use the Burt&#x27;s Baby Bees lotion, apricot oil, shampoo bar and bath bar on him and he smells so yummy my husband says he wants to eat him!  It&#x27;s not the traditional baby scent that we&#x27;re all used to, but I know that I will have sweet memories of this scent for the rest of my life.  It is a soft scent that still hints of childhood.</li>
    <li> Aside from applying this to his whole body after baths, I&#x27;ve dabbed extra amounts of this onto every slight skin irritation my baby has had since he was born, after which it was always cleared up within hours.  I love that they are accountable for the exact percentage of natural vs synthetic ingredients in each one of their products.  I can feel good about putting this brand on my baby&#x27;s delicate skin.  FYI-I believe the tiny percentage that is not natural is just to preserve the product.</li>
