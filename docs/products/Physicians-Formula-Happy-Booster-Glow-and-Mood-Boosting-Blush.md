      <li>Pretty and perfect for daily use...  </li>
      <li>it seems to have lost all scent, which is fine with me.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>That said, this is a fabulous product.</li>
      <li>just use a light hand.</li>
      <li>This is a great blush, The color is the traditional color of a blush</li>
      <li>my face looks fabulous.</li>
      <li>This is a super fun product, great color, and so easy to put on for a natural cheek color.</li>
      <li>And forget the other claims, this thing is so cute it makes you happy just looking at</li>
      <li>It works great, all natural, and a beautiful color for pale people!</li>
      <li>I am the type of girl who wears it for special occasions, like when weeks of my tomboy-ish behavior makes me feel like I need to be girly for a day.</li>
      <li>This blush is a great pink for my complexion.  </li>
      <li>The mix of the colors is gorgeous and I love the slight shimmer.</li>
      <li>but I was super allergic to this makeup, I don&#x27;t know why.</li>
      <li>The packaging is too cute and the price is not too high compared to the quantity.</li>
      <li>I like it very much, it does what is says!</li>

      <li>I like the smaller rose heart, but that color</li>
      <li>In general you want to apply blush, then dusting a bit of powder or bronzer on top</li>
      <li>i really am happy with this blush and i dont like the small brush in it.</li>
      <li>It gives your cheek a glow (like right after you clean and put on moisturizer) and a tiny bit of fine sparkle/shimmer that you can&#x27;t tell unless within 2 feet of your face.</li>
      <li>used  the physicians only nice box thanks</li>
      <li>It does not have much of a scent on the face, looks nice, and fade a tiny bit after ~4 hours.</li>
      <li>For my yellow undertone, it&#x27;s a bit too pink/cool, so I swiped a very light layer of (yellow/warm) bronzer over it</li>
      <li>I love this, I actually bought it for me and my friend for her birthday, which happens to fall on Valentines day.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought several!  </li>
      <li>got this as a 2-for-1 with the Bronzer in the same series because the packaging is so cute.</li>
      <li>Yes it is pricey at first but not a lot compared to the quantity you get.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not going to lie, the look of this blush is what first caught my attention.</li>
      <li>so it looks like the blush comes from underneath instead of obvious make up sitting on top of the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It could also use a better brush, but I like this product overall.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty pigmented for a drugstore blush.</li>
      <li>I love all of their products and finally chose their blush to try.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;m not going to lie, the look of this blush is what first caught my attention. I normally never use PF products, but this was too cute to just pass by. After actually using it, the pink case was just a bonus. The blush is somewhat sheer, but definitely buildable if that&#x27;s the look you like. The mix of the colors is gorgeous and I love the slight shimmer. The violet scent is definitely a mood booster and the icing on the cute little blush cake! :)</li>
    <li> What a great product.  The pink hearts put me in a good mood everytime I look at them.  The color provides a nice flush, and it smells great (violet) too!  I&#x27;m glad I bought several!  I saw this in Glamour but could not find in the store...glad I found it here.</li>
    <li> I like this blush - it adds a little sparkle to your face. I use it everyday even if I don&#x27;t have time for makeup. Can&#x27;t complain about the price. I hope it doesn&#x27;t discontinue like the previous blush I used. I highly recommend it. Anita</li>
    <li> After putting this on, I immediately felt unspeakable euphoria and.....just kidding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this as a 2-for-1 with the Bronzer in the same series because the packaging is so cute. NOTE: it is sold for ~$12 in drugstores, so if it cost more than that on Amazon, find a walmart/CVS/walgreens and get it there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have light/medium asian skin (i.e. yellow undertone) and was afraid this will be too pink. My problem is I blush pink (find out by pinching your cheek) but have yellow undertone, most blush are either pink with cool undertone or orange with yellow undertone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This blush is true pink, and just two light swipes of the brush will give you noticeable color on the cheek. It gives your cheek a glow (like right after you clean and put on moisturizer) and a tiny bit of fine sparkle/shimmer that you can&#x27;t tell unless within 2 feet of your face. For my yellow undertone, it&#x27;s a bit too pink/cool, so I swiped a very light layer of (yellow/warm) bronzer over it and it was perfect. In general you want to apply blush, then dusting a bit of powder or bronzer on top so it looks like the blush comes from underneath instead of obvious make up sitting on top of the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general, recommend. It does not have much of a scent on the face, looks nice, and fade a tiny bit after ~4 hours. And cute packaging of course (bonus: it also have a mirror in the bottom compartment where the brush is).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a PF fan but I was super allergic to this makeup, I don&#x27;t know why. I&#x27;m not allergic to any other PF product. If you have allergies/sensitivity don&#x27;t use this blush.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. I love all of their products and finally chose their blush to try. I&#x27;m platinum blonde and the rose looks awesome w/ my skin and hair. Rosey cheeks! So good!</li>
    <li> This is a great blush, The color is the traditional color of a blush ... pink. It is a true pink . I had an estee lauder blush that I used for 5 years and now I find this colour is very close to what I had. I love the fact that there is not a lot of shimmer. I can use a little for everyday look or more for a more dramatic look . The packaging is too cute and the price is not too high compared to the quantity. Yes it is pricey at first but not a lot compared to the quantity you get.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I&#x27;ve been a PF fan since discovering it in high school, and I&#x27;m a little disappointed it doesn&#x27;t have a bigger following...mostly because I&#x27;m afraid this blush will fade away into the distance, along with other AMAZING products like the colored wax brow crayon that was discontinued way back.  It was brilliant!!  As for this little guy, even if the simulated endorphins are a feel-good marketing ploy, the violet scent and cute embossed hearts make me smile regardless.  Along with the healthy-looking, not too shimmery, fresh color, I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ll have to buy another just in case this one doesn&#x27;t catch on!</li>
    <li> I bought this online and it came out darker then I thought, Id recommend buying a shade lighter</li>
    <li> Pretty and perfect for daily use...  Color blends well.  Bought for Valentine&#x27;s day gift and it was perfect for all the hearts and tones of pink/red.</li>
    <li> I found this went on smoothly and gave my cheeks a nice rosy glow. It looked very natural, and lasted all day. I have very sensitive skin, and this didn&#x27;t bother me at all. I would recommend it!</li>
    <li> Coming from someone who&#x27;s not that crazy about makeup, this blush does the trick. It gives just enough of a hue to not look pasty. Definitely not sure where the &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34; is? Mine doesn&#x27;t smell like anything, maybe I got an old batch and it wore off? Scent or not, I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Perfect combination of just enough color with a tint of highlights. I like to wear a more natural tone during the day so this works well for me.</li>
    <li> This blush is a great pink for my complexion.  It comes in a fun compact that is fun to use.  It is very girly and feminine.  What more can I say?  It&#x27;s the greatest!</li>
    <li> Good blush for the price</li>
    <li> I like this shade, especially now when I am transitioning my make-up from bronze winter tones to pink spring tones.  The compact is significantly smaller than the other two shades of Physicians Formula blush/bronzer that I have, but I saw it in Wal-mart (for $2 cheaper), and it was the same small size.</li>
    <li> This blush is beautiful! It works great, all natural, and a beautiful color for pale people! I can use it without anything just to add a little natural color to my face.</li>
    <li> The upsides of this product are that it&#x27;s a pretty, sheer true pink, exactly the right amount of sparkle (almost none),  and obviously, the extremely cute packaging.  It comes with a cute little brush that works adequately, if not wonderfully, and a mirror in the bottom of the compact. It does give a &#x27;happy glow&#x27;, natural looking flushed color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is pleasant and not too strong, and it does not seem to leave scent on your face when used.  (In fact, now that I&#x27;ve had the blush a couple months it seems to have lost all scent, which is fine with me.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside is that, like most physician&#x27;s products, the packaging is flimsy and can&#x27;t stand up to being tossed in your purse.  It could also use a better brush, but I like this product overall.</li>
    <li> I love this, I actually bought it for me and my friend for her birthday, which happens to fall on Valentines day. I know she will love it. I want to get the bronzer too. The smell is lovely, and the color is a beautiful rose- just use a light hand. It&#x27;s pretty pigmented for a drugstore blush. Physican&#x27;s formula always makes such great products, and this one is soo cute too. highly reccomend, get yours before they all sell out</li>
    <li> I would like to let those customers that complained that they were only using one or two of the colors from this compact, that if you will use a &amp;#34;blend&amp;#34;, it really works nicely.  Now I do have a darker, olive complexion but all I do is swipe the blush brush across the compact, which picks up a combination of all colors and it really looks great.  I don&#x27;t think this compact was designed for you to pick out on one of the colors to use.  I will order again when this one is empty.</li>
    <li> Ok, so, be honest with yourself...why are you REALLY looking at this blush?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s all those cute little hearts right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yep, they are just as cute in person. And forget the other claims, this thing is so cute it makes you happy just looking at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that&#x27;s why it stays in my makeup bag, even though it has no other discernible purpose. The claims about how it makes you feel are clearly junk (and don&#x27;t you want them to be? You really want mood-inducing chemicals penetrating through all your makeup and your skin and getting into your brain? I didn&#x27;t think so). The smell is ok, and, as a surprise bonus, not very strong at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However it&#x27;s difficult to apply. I use expensive brushes, and they barely pick up any product at all from this (you might be better with some synthetic or cheap brushes). So it&#x27;s hard to get a lot of color out of the box. I also made the ?mistake? of getting this in the &#x27;natural&#x27; tone, so it&#x27;s not even that pink to begin with. I end up using it more as a kind of blush-blendable contour (since I&#x27;m very fair), and it does a passable job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy it again? Well, I probably wouldn&#x27;t replace it, but if you have the money for makeup &#x27;toys&#x27; this isn&#x27;t an expensive one and its a bit of fun.</li>
    <li> I use this blusher almost every day. It&#x27;s light, smells very good, it&#x27;s soothing, and it always makes me smile just looking at the cute hearts. I really like a lot of the Physicians Formula products and so far they&#x27;ve never let me down!</li>
    <li> I have been very happy with this blush. I am fairly pale naturally and this adds a slight pink tone without looking like clown makeup. It looks natural and gives a boost to my complexion.</li>
    <li> I love Physicians Formula&#x27;s products. I think they are way underrated.  It&#x27;s really hard to find where I live so I love the variety Amazon has. The Happy Booster is amazing like 90% of their product&#x27;s.  It adds a nice bronze glow without looking muddy. Its a great product!</li>
    <li> The fiance says that the blush doesn&#x27;t improve my mood!  Haha!  I am not a morning person, so I never really thought it could...  However, I really like the color and it layers well for more dramatic looks.</li>
    <li> Just enough to look rosy and healthy on these wintery cold days!!</li>
    <li> I love PF. I have sensitive skin. I also seem to have a hard time finding the right shade of blush. This one works beautifully. It blends really nice on my skin to create a very nice color. Not to dark or light. It is cute too. I love the brush and use it with my bronzer as well. 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Really great product! like the smell, and have a really good pigmentation! is a good blush to have in your stack.</li>
    <li> I use this as a highlight to my high part of my cheeks. A little goes a long way. This comes with a small brush and mirror. I would recommend this if you like pinks or rose colored cheeks.</li>
    <li> I like it but when I used it in my face I feel the hat blusher what is it i don&#x27;t like used  the physicians only nice box thanks</li>
    <li> I am not a makeup connoisseur. I am the type of girl who wears it for special occasions, like when weeks of my tomboy-ish behavior makes me feel like I need to be girly for a day. Ha! That said, this is a fabulous product. I swipe it on my cheeks and call it good. It adds a blush effect and makes my face look radiant. Almost no effort and my face looks fabulous. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this blush! I do believe it puts you in a good mood! Its a great color and I would suggest dipping the brush in once for each cheek because a little goes a long way, but at just the right amount its a gorgeous color!</li>
    <li> I just purchased this in Rose.  You really have to briskly brush to get color.&lt;br /&gt;It all depends on the look you want.  I like the smaller rose heart, but that color&lt;br /&gt;is minimal- so the rest of the pallete is to faint.  I&#x27;m fair and need some color&lt;br /&gt;so this doesn&#x27;t work all that well.</li>
    <li> I love these blushes. I own them in natural and rose. They are so pretty and have a wonderful smell. They blend well over my mineral make up and bronzer. As far as the name goes they do make me happy. The scent is uplifting as so are the cute multi colored hearts.</li>
    <li> i really am happy with this blush and i dont like the small brush in it. i used my own blush brush and it is amazing. people say my face got more prettier and it stayed on all day. I love it.</li>
    <li> Love the product. Fast shipping</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s not to love about this? It gives an amazing glow to the skin, lasts a real long time and even smells great. Oh, and it&#x27;s priced very well. I could go on and on but will keep this short. Buy it! You will also love it. No need to look at other brands on this one.</li>
    <li> Love this blush! Super cute, smells great and you can use a little for a subtle pink or a lot for a very noticeable dark pink. Love that it comes with a brush and that the case has a mirror.</li>
    <li> This is a super fun product, great color, and so easy to put on for a natural cheek color.</li>
    <li> I like it very much, it does what is says!</li>
    <li> My favorite blush and aweso price.</li>
