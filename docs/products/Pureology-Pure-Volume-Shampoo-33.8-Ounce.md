      <li>She went on to explain that there is another formula which is closer to the original which is called Pureology Pure Volume Extra Care Shampoo, also in a pink bottle, which reportedly does not matte the hair together or create a drying effect.  </li>
      <li>This is the first time that it appeared to have been watered down.  </li>
      <li>I discovered she was right as they changed my hair from dry, dull, and limp to healthy looking.  </li>
      <li>This Pureology product also has the added benefit of adding volume to thin and fine hair.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this shampoo.  Expensive but well worth it.</li>
    <li> I have also used their moisturizing shampoo.  I have fine straight hair that is highlighted. My stylist recommended this for my hair.  Now I won&#x27;t used anything else. And Amazon sells it for much less than the salon.</li>
    <li> Wife loves this product</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product.  Cheaper on-site than at beauty salon.</li>
    <li> Before buying this product make sure you look at the DATE of the reviews you read.  I used to use this very same shampoo and loved it until my most recent bottle purchased in November 2013.  I noticed that my hair felt really weird, sort of rough/like hay, while I was shampooing and I had a hard time even getting a pick (bigger even than a regular comb) through my wet hair after.  I noticed the &amp;#34;new formulation&amp;#34; label on the bottle but didn&#x27;t make the connection with the progressive decine in the condition of my hair until after I brought it up to my hairdresser.  I even had bloodwork done because my DOCTOR notice how dry, brittle, and terrible my hair had become when I went for my annual physical!  My hairdresser mentioned that she has had a number of the same compliants about this product.  Now I am stuck with half a bottle of this very expensive hair-killer. SAVE YOUR $-DO NOT BUY THIS NEW FORMULA!!!</li>
    <li> Great!  Been using this for years and love it! The price was so much better than in the stores.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Only need a daub.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo line ever made.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo cant be without it.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived before expected. Perfect condition.</li>
    <li> LARGE SELECTION OF HAIR CARE PRODUCTS. THEY HAD WHAT I  WAS  LOOKING FOR, HIGH QUALITY RIGHT PRICE AND FAST SERVICE</li>
    <li> I had been using Pureology Pure Volume Shampoo for many years and absolutely loved it. Recently I ran out of the shampoo and purchased another bottle from my local salon.  Upon trying the newly purchased shampoo,  I noticed that it was extremely difficult to use because it actually matted my hair together!  I couldn&#x27;t get my fingers or a pick through my hair until after I used conditioner.  I thought this was incredibly odd so I decided to do a search for reviews of the product to see if others were having the same experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I contacted Pureology to explain the situation.  The representative noted that this is a new formula and was apologetic for my unsatisfactory experience.  Upon asking her if others contacted Pureology with the same feedback, she acknowledged that others have done so.  She went on to explain that there is another formula which is closer to the original which is called Pureology Pure Volume Extra Care Shampoo, also in a pink bottle, which reportedly does not matte the hair together or create a drying effect.  I hope to make an exchange at my salon for the Extra Care version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I did not purchase this item on Amazon, I still wanted to note my opinion as it is very similar to the other dissatisfied reviewers who made the purchase on this site.</li>
    <li> Have used this for years now.  Tried cheaper shampoo and keep going back to this one.  My daughter uses it too</li>
    <li> Good price and convenient</li>
    <li> Of all the shampoos I&#x27;ve tried that advertise volume, I find this one delivers best for me.  Sadly, a little pricey but I guess most of them are.</li>
    <li> truly love this shampoo, gentle enough to use everyday and my hair has never looked so healthy....the smell is also a plus..wish Pureology made body wash in this scent...wonderful</li>
    <li> I loved the ORIGINAL of this product and thought I was buying the original formula..WRONG!  My hair felt terrible after using....like straw and worse.  In the original, I use a dime&#x27;s worth and my hair was clean and shiny and with this, it feels dry and I&#x27;m not kidding, like STRAW.  I sent mine back.  What a shame.</li>
    <li> It makes my hair feel like straw as I wash.  Was a loyal Pureology customer but will never buy this product again.</li>
    <li> ... for this excellent shampoo which has improved the condition of my very fine hair.  I appreciate being able to purchase the full liter.</li>
    <li> Have bought this shampoo several times from several sources.  This is the first time that it appeared to have been watered down.  It was much runnier than normal.</li>
    <li> Been using it for years.</li>
    <li> Am so glad others are experiencing the &amp;#34;hay&amp;#34; issue (it&#x27;s not just me). Have even gone to mixing in another shampoo so I can get a good lather. It used to take such a small amount. Now it takes a palm full. My hair dries in clumps, which can be brushed out, but it never did it before. Sad. Have to find something else and don&#x27;t know what to use. Wrote Pureology. No feedback.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser first told me about the Pureology products and how she wouldn&#x27;t recommend anything else.  I discovered she was right as they changed my hair from dry, dull, and limp to healthy looking.  This Pureology product also has the added benefit of adding volume to thin and fine hair.  It is the best!</li>
    <li> It supposedly has no harmful chemicals and males my hair look great.  It is pricey though, so I buy the large bottle.</li>
    <li> Purchased the New Formula &amp; hate it so much.  It totally dries my hair out, could not use this w/out following it a conditioner. The previous formula was so much better. Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this shampoo...  I don&#x27;t like the cost :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is by far the best price for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  Best price on Pureology!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  BIG bottle that takes up a lot of room</li>
    <li> Smells good. Makes your hair feel thick. Worth the price.</li>
