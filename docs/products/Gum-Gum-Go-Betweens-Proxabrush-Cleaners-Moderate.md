<ol>
    <li> these are great for cleaning between your teeth.  I bought medium-sized ones because of gum recession. Each one lasts a few days and should be kept clean after each use. I would recommend these highly.</li>
    <li> Just what my dentist recommended. Easy to use, and really helps with food stuck in between teeth.</li>
    <li> Ever have those chunks of food stuck between your teeth that flossing will not remove?  Well, your problem is solved.  I have purchased the Go-Betweens in different sizes: the &amp;#34;narrow&amp;#34;, these &amp;#34;mid-size&amp;#34;, and the &amp;#34;wide&amp;#34; as the gaps between my teeth are different in width. Easy to use and  rinse after use. They are short-lived due to the narrow wire, but do their job well.</li>
    <li> use these every day for quality cleaning</li>
    <li> Works much better than a tooth brush and stimulates the gums.  Would be lost without my Proxabrush.  A must according to my dentist.</li>
    <li> These are great cleaners.  They get in between your teeth and do a great job.  I will be purchasing more of these in the future.</li>
    <li> These are great to use between those teeth that have a relatively moderate space near my gums. I use them as a supplement to flossing and brushing my teeth. Now, when I go to the dentist office for cleanings, they&#x27;re very impressed!</li>
    <li> The Proxabrush, used after every meal, helps cut down the buildup of plaque. I rinse them after the meal, so I can get two days use from each brush. This product is highly recommended by my dental hygienist.</li>
    <li> arrived on time and as described</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product for caring for your teeth. Just be careful of the size you order. These are fairly large, were actually to big for my teeth. Unless you have significant space between your teeth you won&#x27;t be able to use them. They do have smaller and larger sizes to ordered.</li>
    <li> The proxabrush&#x27;s are actually the new style of proxabrush not the old style as pictured.  The new style does not work nearly as well.  But I will keep them because the new style is the only one I can seem to find anymore.</li>
    <li> Quick and Easy. I loved the idea of having a package of three, so that I do not have to order so often.</li>
    <li> Love these little brushes for in between my teeth where floss wouldn&#x27;t even go. I floss, brush and then use the little proxabrushes and still pull some food out. I have pockets between some of my teeth that floss can&#x27;t even reach. These little proxabrushes are very handy and work well.</li>
    <li> These add another level to good dental hygiene. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> These are great.  You get to brush between your teeth.  Better than flossing especially if you have had gum surgery.</li>
    <li> I love Gum Go-Between Cleaners and my pharmacy and big box stores aren&#x27;t carrying them any more.  I&#x27;m very glad I can buy several at a time here.</li>
    <li> Want really clean  teeth?  There is nothing  like these little  brushes  to really clean and purify your  teeth.  It&#x27;s like  brushing  your  hair  and  you feel great  after  the stimulation of  using  these  brushes.  Better than floss.</li>
    <li> They may still be with you if you use this excellent product. A much more desirable goal than being toothless.</li>
    <li> Great product and enough of it to keep running to the local store for it.</li>
    <li> I like old version. It holds longer than this new one. Fair enough but I realyl miss the old version</li>
    <li> Love the Go-Betweens.  So much easier than flossing.</li>
