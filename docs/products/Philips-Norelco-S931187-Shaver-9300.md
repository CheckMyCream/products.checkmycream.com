<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Really good shave including my balding head. I like the cleaner much better than my old 8000 series.</li>
    <li> Too time-consuming to clean the tiny shaving head receptacle after each shave. It also misses areas which necessitates my running the shaver repeatedly over the same part of my face. At times, it feels as though it is pulling on my hairs too. Overall, it is not worth the money. I wish I had just ordered the shaver similar to the old model I owned prior to this one. It shaves a lot better than this very expensive shaver. Now I know why Costco sells a later model very similar to the design of my old shaver.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this shaver. I was getting constantly irrated skin with a normal razor and went look for an electric replacement. This shaver is easy to use and causes me no irritation. It does a great job, especially after a little time learning how to best use it, and for me is just a much better experience than I ever had with a conventional razor.</li>
    <li> This is the best Norelco yet. I&#x27;ve had several and they keep improving them.</li>
    <li> Give you smooth shaving from the first time. Net and clean .</li>
    <li> Great shaver,have owned many shavers and this one is the best.This shaver gives a great close shave every time! I would recomend it to everyone who likes a quiet ,close shaving razor!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Use it Wet!! (With Shaving Cream)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this a week ago as my old panasonic (foil) bit the dust.  I used it a couple of days and just didn&#x27;t care for it, it felt rough, wasnt getting the same level of shave as with my 7 yr old panasonic.  After reading reviews here and elsewhere, I bought some neutrogina shaving gel and just shaved this morning.. It was night and day difference..  The shaver didn&#x27;t feel rough on the skin and I got a pretty good shave.  I think it will get better as I learn to use the rotary on different parts of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So net, before you return it, try it w/shaving cream and see if you like it.</li>
    <li> Not able to shave as close as I expected. Noticeable noise when cleaning, you can here it with the bathroom door closed. Carrying pouch is useful and really easy to separate the head for quick washing with water. Battery last  really long. I used the shaver over a week without charging though the batter was not even half empty.</li>
    <li> Does a good job on my beard.</li>
    <li> I was reluctant to spend that much on a shaver but now I&#x27;m glad I did.  It shaves closer than my old Norelco with less effort.  I didn&#x27;t think I needed the cleaning unit either but now I really like it.  I just rinse the heads after each shave and place the shaver on the cleaning unit and forget it until tomorrow.  It comes out perfectly cleaned, charged and dry.  I am very happy with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE!  After using this product for over one year I have to honestly say I am very disappointed.  The cleaning unit no longer works.  It lasted about 8 months.  The shaver did shave very close at first but the heads wear out in 2 or 3 months and you realize that it isn&#x27;t any better than your old shaver.  In fact, I AM CURRENTLY USING MY OLD NORELCO because I refuse to keep buying those expensive replacement heads.  My advice to you is to stay away from any shaver using these heads.  They just do not hold an edge like they should.</li>
    <li> the best of a long line of improved shavers.  I got my first one when I was 17, a gift from my father, used it during basic training in the Army and have never used another brand of shaver since then and now I am 82</li>
    <li> My husband loves it!!! After trying so many different products he finally found the ONE..</li>
    <li> The shave is as close as I&#x27;ve ever had with an electric razor, especially over my bumpy, bald head.  Also, the trimmer is easy enough to put on &amp; take off &amp; works well. But, I&#x27;m  disappointed that it doesn&#x27;t have a stand to keep it in on the counter when not in use, doesn&#x27;t have a shaver head guard, doesn&#x27;t have a cleaning brush, is difficult to hold while shaving without turning the motor off, &amp; I&#x27;m not real happy that I have to buy into the cleaning &amp;#34;system&amp;#34; that I have to reorder every 3 months.  Also, I&#x27;m a little leery of the quick wash method of putting the shaver head under hot water after each use as I don&#x27;t want to further slow down my already slow drain.  And finally, the cost at over $200 is out of sight, especially with on-going costs you&#x27;re locked into.  Otherwise, a pretty good shaver.</li>
    <li> Beware of misleading positive reviews for this model have been left by Norelco promoters and vendors .I&#x27;m using Philips Norelco since 10 years ago and my old Norlco 1280 was like a dream ,but the head razor got worn and new replacement was so pricey.Finally I decided to buy this new Philips Norelco s9300 I was shocked when I opened the box the new model razors head was completely made from cheap plastic and cleaning blades head was a nightmare , Unlike Braun series 7 the cleaning system for this shaver dose not sanitizie the razors head  because it is made from water based solution it just clean the leftover  stables and lubricate,charge the battery only , I didn&#x27;t like this point with this cleaning system due the lack hygienic for the shaver ,Norelco customers service didn&#x27;t give me satisfied answers over this question .The shaver dose not deliver close shave but honestly after use it with wet shaving and gel method it gives close shave but hold on !!! You have to spend further extra time and mess over the sink to clean up the unit under running water and to repeat it for several times at least every 3- 4 strokes , I personally didn&#x27;t satisfy with this Norelco model  and after going in deep underwhelming I decided to give a try my luck again and go to new adventure and buy  Panasonic ES-LV81-K  ARC5 with five blades and .I was pleased and happy with it , Panasonic delivered the most closest  shave I have ever experienced with any other shaver in my  life , No irritation, NO mess and no time wasting again , in less then 3 minutes I&#x27;m ready to go with very smooth close shave ,I heard many reviews that Panasonic can&#x27;t go wrong , I will never go back to this retarded and stone age Norelco ,  for someone still interested for this model of Norelco Good luck ,,</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. I like the fact that every morning I have a clean and dry razor, even if I used gel on my face the previous day. Love it. My family got it for me for Christmas. This is probably my fourth or fifth Norelco. Never disappointed.</li>
    <li> While I have always been a Norelco fan (50+ years), I tried this higher end model that cleans and lubricates itself and found that basically, it is a waste of time for me -- I would never buy this model again since it is easier for me to take the heads apart and blow them out with compressed air instead of buying refills of cleaning and lubricating solution and letting it clean itself -- methinks this is 99% hype.  I would much rather have purchased a more traditional Norelco without the bangs and whistles for less cost.  In appending my rating after using this product for several months, I took away another star -- it does not stay sharp, heads are angled wrong for shaving ears, and it has major trouble with shaving stubble from a day or two of not shaving and does a terrible job on the stubble.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this razor. I&#x27;ve used Norelco for years and this is a great razor!</li>
    <li> I have had this thing for about a month and I absolutely love it. I have been using just straight razor for years and I decided to upgrade to this bad boy to save some time. I can shave in a fraction of the time! It is a super close shave that will leave your face smooth every time. I defiantly recommend this product to everyone that has to shave daily like I do.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend bought this for me as gift. I love it so much!</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver!  I have had an earlier version Norelco and a Braun Series 5, this is by far my favorite.  As far as a shave goes, it shaves very close and does not cut or irritate my face.  I like the floating heads and the flexibility of the shaving head as it helps to get under the chin and the contours of the neck.  It is quiet, light, and comfortable to hold.  It has some good tech features such as led display of battery juice, time to replace shaving head, and a few more that I can&#x27;t remember what they are as they are not important to me.  I had to read the manual to understand the cleaning charging unit as that is new for me.  I like the cleaning charging unit as it will keep,my shaver in top shape.  My one drawback is that if you want to use the trimmer for sideburns, etc. you have to pop the head off and pop the trimming attachment in.  My other shavers just had a flip up trimmer.  Since I do not use it a lot, it is no big deal but if you trim regularly it can be annoying.  Overall I am so pleased with the close shave, the triple floating heads that make shaving quick (big triple heads cover a lot of beard surface area quick), and the light well made comfortable shaver.</li>
    <li> Love It. Sensitive skin friendly while doing a job. Have always owned electric razors and this is one of the best.</li>
    <li> Update - 1 year and 6 months after purchase, 1 year and 1 month after smart clean replacement.  The pump in the replacement smart clean died.  Everything else works on the unit but it seems to not have any means of knowing the pump doesn&#x27;t work.  No troubleshooting could get it to work so I contacted Philips again.  Something to note:  YOUR WARRANTY, EVEN ON REPLACEMENTS, IS TWO YEARS FROM THE DATE OF THE ORIGINAL PURCHASE.  Luckily I am still within that 2 years.  Contacted Philips, even after hours, and got a response, they had access to my information from before which is probably why it went quickly and in about 20 minutes I had an email for a replacement in the mail with 2 day shipping no less.  While a smart clean is not really needed, should this new replacement die or malfunction like the last one, I did pay for it and it&#x27;s unfortunate they do not renew the warranty for a replacement part.  I would be fine if the shaver, which by the way has been flawless and perfect since the first shave, only had a 2 year warranty, but every time they replace any of the other components, it should at least have a year warranty on it.  Here is hoping it will last more than a year!  Update - 8 months after purchase, 2 months after smart clean replacement  It took a while, but Norelco came through with a replacement Smartclean system.  In fact they upgraded it to the higher model that comes with the 9700.  No issues yet with it, I have used it about every 2 weeks and it does a fantastic job.  4 stars now for Norelco&#x27;s great warranty service, despite going back and forth with them a while, the end result and standing by their product deserves the added star.  Update - 3 months later  The shaver is still working great and still is the closest and most comfortable shave outside of a straight shave, however in just the last week I&#x27;ve noticed strange behaviour from my &amp;#34;Smartclean&amp;#34; system.  It turns out it&#x27;s not so smart after all.  If I leave it plugged in, it&#x27;ll run the cleaning cycle over and over and over again at random intervals.  So unfortunately I have to keep it unplugged except when cleaning it.  If I do not, not only will it run the cleaning cycle, but it&#x27;ll glitch with draining the fluid and end up spilling it all over the counter.  It even runs it when the shaver is not plugged into the base.  I expected much better considering the price of the shaver and system.  I unfortunately expect the &amp;#34;Smartclean&amp;#34; to give out and stop working considering the glitches.  ---- Original Review ----  While a little intimidating at first due to the larger heads, this shaver has definitely been a cut above the previous ones I have owned. My last shaver, Norelco 8240 XL, I had owned for about four years, replacing the cutting heads as needed, about every year.  But I had always had a skin irritation issue with that shaver, it was mild and as I had it before with the 7000 series, I just figured it was a part of using an electric shaver.  Enter the 9300 shaver.  I spent a few months researching this shaver and it’s more expensive counterpart, the 9700.  Ultimately it came down to saving over $100 for the same shaver with the exception that it would not have a digital battery gauge or a cleaner that tracked the progress through the cleaning cycle.  I figured I could live without both of those because really, who needs to know that?  The larger shaver heads with the independently pivoting inner and outer rings are perfect.  This has been the closest shave I have had with an electric shaver and the best of all, I no longer have any skin irritation.  I credit this to the shaver doing a better job of cutting and a better job of following the skin, so there&#x27;s less chance of the blade scraping your skin.  The ability of the shaver to follow facial contours makes it perfect for the neck, a problem I have always had with previous shavers.  The cleaning system is a bonus.  With previous shavers I would clean them myself with an alcohol, hot water and lubrication bath, but this system does it all on its own!  Just place it in the caddy, press the button and it does the work.  It’ll let you know on the 9300 when it’s done, same as the 9700 but without the step by step tracking.  Just put it in before you go to work and it&#x27;ll be ready when you come home at night, or start the cleaning at night and it&#x27;ll be perfect in the morning.  The cleaning is about 10-15min and then about 4 hours of drying time.  I find that using it every two weeks is just fine and thoroughly rinsing the shaver head with hot water after every shave works great to keep it clean between cycles.  Overall I definitely approve, this was worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Outstanding shave! I upgraded to the 9300 from the Philips Norelco Sensotouch 3D. The shave is closer and more comfortable with the 9300. The cleaning station takes up less space than the cleaning station for the Sensotouch 3D. The shaver heads are easier to open for rinsing out after shaving. The top comes off so you can rinse all three heads then snap it back in. The cartridge for the cleaning station is easy to install and should last 2 to 3 months. It is only $16 for three. In addition there is a coupon code you receive when you register the product that will give you 50% off a pack of three, $8. I highly recommend this shaver. It is the best electric shaver I have owned.</li>
    <li> I am 78 years old and have been shaving with an electric shaver since I was 18 or 19 and this is absolutely the worst shaver I have ever owned. It feel as if it is pulling the whiskers out instead of cutting them off.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a Philips user for decades now and really can&#x27;t go wrong by continuing to use their products. Their previous shaver lasted me almost 8 years, so when it was time to upgrade I again decided to buy the best one my money could afford as I knew this would be with me for another 5-8 years. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Could NOT tell the difference in shave closeness or comfort between this Norelco 9000 series razor and the 6000 series razor I bought a year ago. I was expecting a noticeably closer shave.  I used the 9000 for over a month before returning it.  All the bells and whistles are very nice- self cleaning system especially - but you have to find a place in your home to put the self-cleaning system - it&#x27;s almost like a new appliance- it needs to be &amp;#34;out&amp;#34; in the open so it&#x27;s easy to use-I didn&#x27;t want to have to unplug it, wrap up the cord, store the system away then reverse the whole process once I need to clean the razor again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EXCELLENT razor - I couldn&#x27;t tell the difference vs. my other Norelco razor in terms of shave closeness or comfort so returned it and continue to use my 6000 and am very happy with my 6000. I would highly recommend this razor if this is going to be a first electric razor or if you are switching from another brand- I would NOT recommend if you are upgrading and expecting a significant difference in closeness.  Of course, everyone&#x27;s facial hair is different, right?  So some people may be able to notice a difference. I would say I have average facial hair- shave every day during the week and once on the weekend.  I never have to shave twice in a day and I really can&#x27;t go 2 days without shaving for work.</li>
    <li> The shaver is excellent!! I love this product!</li>
    <li> This shaver along with some shaving cream in the shower, gives me a comfortable razor close shave, even in the hard to shave parts of my neck. I have tried multiple brands and models over the year , but this has them all beat so far.</li>
    <li> The Shaver works good, quiet, easy to hold. I do not need the head motion. The holder, cleaner takes&lt;br /&gt;a lot of space on the bathroom counter, it looks expensive, the little lites hardly show and are unlabeled.&lt;br /&gt;The instructions pictures should have the text with them; the pictures with the small text are faint and poor.&lt;br /&gt;(I have only one eye with cataract)  Had Norelco shavers for 50 years, they are the best !</li>
    <li> I had my previous Norelco Philips shaver for 9 years and it just recently started running slowly.  Thought about a Braun, but why?  My old Philips worked well and this new model is quieter, lighter, and gives a great shave.  Expensive?  Maybe, but if it lasts another 9 years, well worth the investment.</li>
    <li> good item great price fast delivery</li>
    <li> Been shaving for over 35 years, and this is nearly the worst electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned. Received as a Christmas gift and I threw away the box, so I can&#x27;t return it. The instructions said try it for 30 days and give your face a chance to adjust. Well, it&#x27;s March 25th now and this thing is crap. Slow, takes forever to shave. It has 3 speeds, slow, slower, and slowest. If you want to trim, you can&#x27;t just push a button like my Braun, you have to go get the attachment and attach it and then you can use it. If the BATTERY is low, it stops working and you can&#x27;t just plug in the CHARGER, it won&#x27;t run with the charger plugged in. My Braun will run all day with charger plugged in. So, you can&#x27;t finish shaving if battery runs low. A couple hours after I shave it looks like I haven&#x27;t shaved for days. My Braun 5441 is on it&#x27;s tenth set of cutters and is far superior to this piece of garbage. Paid $250 for this and it&#x27;s not worth it. Update:  After about 6 months I got a new Braun 340s-4 for about $80 and it is wet / dry with built in trimmer. It shaves so much closer and runs quieter. Far superior in every way.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t have worked better.</li>
    <li> Great shaver.  The cleaning unit, which also charges the shaver, failed within 5 months.  I am waiting now for Norelco to ship my replacement unit, which is supposedly covered by warranty.  This shaver has 3 speeds for different shaving styles.  I have been using Norelco triple head shavers for many years.  This is by far the closest and fastest shaver I have used.  Comes with a trimming attachment and cleaning/charging stand.</li>
    <li> A little pricey, but good shaver.</li>
    <li> The shaver gives me a closer shave than my Braun did, approximating a blade, although it has taken some getting used to the circular motion versus the up and down shaving motion of my Braun 5 Series.  It gets my neck really well, an area where the Braun struggled, but the Braun did a faster job on my cheeks.  Unit is easy to clean and I love that it can get wet.  Product is well made.  My only complaint so far is its more cumbersome than my Braun and doesn&#x27;t fit in a travel kit as well.  Also, there is no pop-up groomer like on my Braun - I need to change out the head.  Not difficult, but not a flick of the finger either.</li>
    <li> Would not buy this electric razor again, does not get as close as a blade, use your pocket knife instead.</li>
    <li> Without writing a hundred-page review, as others have done, I can say that this razor has rescued my face.  I have very sensitive skin, and I have never found a razor, manual or electric, that I can shave with daily.  I always just shaved twice or maybe three times a week, which I hated, since I don&#x27;t like to look scruffy at the office.  Years ago, I tried other electric razors, including a cheaper Norelco.  They always left my face raw and burned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is a daily shaver for me.  It leaves a little bit of a raw feeling once in a while, but nowhere near what I was used to before.  With the right aftershave, I&#x27;m totally fine.  I&#x27;m also surprised at how close it cuts.  I can get a shave that looks as close as a real razor shave.  It still feels the slightest bit rough, but looks great.  I have used this in the shower and also dry.  Both work very well.  I just do whatever is more convenient for me on different days.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever used, it&#x27;s easy on the skin and shaves amazingly close to the skin, super smooth. The only thing I would say I find could be improved is the grip, it does not feel as comfortable and as natural as it could be to hold it, but it shaves amazingly. It comes with their SmartClean system which is amazing, hassle free just place the shaver in it after each shaving session and it cleans it perfectly, really clean feels like new each time. Downside is that you need to buy their cleaning solution periodically, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I did not buy this off Amazon but at Wal-Mart because they had them before Amazon did. I am a Norelco user. I have sensitive skin and the foil shavers do not work well on my beard. This is the absolute best shaver I have ever used. It gets the shave done much faster than the previous model I had the Philips Norelco SensoTouch 3D which was a very good shaver. It is much gentler on my face than any other shaver I have used as well. It works great on body hair too. The attachments I really like. The cleaner does a wonderful job. I am impressed. The cost is high but still cheaper than many others on the market. I choose the 9300 over the 9700 because of price. I do not need a digital display.</li>
    <li> Great product and well worth the money. The razor cuts better than any electric razor I&#x27;ve ever owned (Braun and Norelco Sensotouch).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Performance:&lt;br /&gt;Razor proves a great shaving experience. The razor feels lighter than others I&#x27;ve used, and it doesn&#x27;t feels as premium as you would expect. However, the body does feel nice in-hand. It has a great finish with a nice rubber backing. It gives you a great shave. You can do both a dry or wet shave. The dry shave is smooth and give you a fine shave for an electric razor. The wet shave is as good as razor, not quite, but close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Value:&lt;br /&gt;The price may be more than expected for those that haven&#x27;t used a top-of-the-line product from Norelco or Braun, but this isn&#x27;t the first line of flagship shavers I&#x27;ve purchased.  Do I believe the price will continue to drop? Sure.  This series just came out last month.  However, this series is just that, top-of-the-line.  It has all the features and benefits one could want in a shaver and more.  For me, the closer shave, the better cleaning system (compared to my older ones), and the wet shave capability make the purchase worth it.  Everything is relative, this is the same price as dinner and a 3D movie with the family; however, this is all mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comparison in the 9000 Series:&lt;br /&gt;Norelco 9700 is the flagship model of this series. The 9300 model includes everything the 9700 has with two main differences. The 9700 has a percentage reading rather than the graphic indicator for battery life (see photos). I don&#x27;t have any issues with reading the last line on the indicator vs. &amp;#34;10%&amp;#34;. The other difference is the Smartclean System. The 9700 comes with the pro version. It has little lights that show you progress between each stage. This model only lights up the stages (photo attached). However, I don&#x27;t plan on standing in front of the machine watching it progress through the cleaning cycle, so I think the lighted stages are more than enough. These two differences don&#x27;t seem to justify price difference, but the 9700 does look nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Package:&lt;br /&gt;The package I got included the precision trimmer attachment (Smartclick - see photo), Smartclean system, and also a nice protective cover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extra Tip:&lt;br /&gt;This package comes with the precision trimmer, but I think the beard trimmer may have been a better attachment to find. The beard trimmer is the same as the precision trimmer if you remove the guard. However, with the guard the trimmer can be used to shape your beard at different designated lengths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;Get the 9400. You won&#x27;t regret it.differences don&#x27;t seem to justify price difference, but the 9700 does look nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Package:&lt;br /&gt;The package I got included the precision trimmer attachment (Smartclick - see photo), Smartclean system, and also a nice protective cover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extra Tip:&lt;br /&gt;This package comes with the precision trimmer, but I think the beard trimmer may have been a better attachment to find.

    <li> My last experience with a Philips Norelco was not very great as even though it was advertised as having a floating head, its performance especially in the neck region was not satisfactory.  I had been a fan of Braun shaver which I had been using for more than 2 years.  This summer the Braun decided to quit working and rather than try to get it repaired I decided to give the Philips Norelco another try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was amazed by the change between the last model and this as this one gave one of the smoothest saves ever in most cases better than what can be achieved by a five blade razor.  The razor gives perfect shaves even in the neck area with none of the irritation that i used to have with the earlier rotary model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only gripe that i have with the razor is its cleaning cartridge apart from it being monstrous and the plug connection at the top seems that i will not last the life of the razor.  Philips should have designed this with contact charge points on the side of the razor rather than at the bottom.  Also the cleaning takes close to 8 hours to complete.  But the device performs its task very well.  Also like many other reviewers have pointed out the cleaning device cannot be tilted even a little bit without spilling the cleaning solution.</li>
    <li> Thank you! I am very satisfied!</li>
    <li> I like the electric shaver. Changed from razor shaving</li>
    <li> Norelco Shaver is pretty great and easy to use for the face and other body parts (like legs surprisingly gets close). I found that the only issues with it is understanding the icons like when the shower thing appears to let you know if it can be used in water or not (shower) seems to work best when one just lightly gets the shaver heads wet so it can glide around on the skin, but then it also does great dry as once it gets going it gets going well. Difficult spots on the face are still difficult with this so it will take about twenty or so minutes to get good coverage and then general touch up, but otherwise that is the norm. Cleaning is a breeze following the instructions in the manual for removing the heads running water over them to clear the hair (takes sometime and some pressurized (lightly) water to get it loose and cleared. There is a cleaning system but I dont think Id use it after every single shave maybe unless performance is notably decreased. Works best while shaving in tiny circular motions as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the cost Id definitely stick with this shaver and potentially have a fund to get replacement heads, it does tell one on the device when it is time to replace one (yearly it seems like it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was already used to an electric shave so it didnt seem like I needed time to get used to this on my face or not get a close shave. Though I dont have much hair or long hair in any case.</li>
    <li> Shave every day or two?  Care about your skin and want a close shave?  Look no further, that is if you can afford the [[ASIN:B00M1E5G9S Philips Norelco S9311/84, 9300 Shaver]].  You can get another for much, much less, but as soon as you open the box, you know you are in for an electric shaver that deserves to be at the top of the list.  With three replaceable shaving blades and a separate cleaning station which can also charge the shaver, an hour after plugging this in, you are set for about fifty minutes of shaving time.  While our shaver was being charged, we read every word of the English only manual that explains everything about it and didn&#x27;t cringe once at the language.  It&#x27;s one of the best consumer manuals I&#x27;ve read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Visually, it&#x27;s all top notch.  Ergonomically, it fits his hand and mine.  To remove the three rotating blades for deep cleaning or replacement, it&#x27;s recommended to do one at a time in order to not mess up the functioning on your face.  Unlike your car tires, do not rotate them.  The cleaning device has a made in the Netherlands self contained solution that is replaceable, it is not refillable.  I&#x27;m not going to get into more details about how this works or the edger that pops in and out without a twist, just like the head assembly, because I don&#x27;t want to detract from your enjoyment as you read the manual yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, how does it shave?  Like a dream.  Enough said.  They say there may be a break-in time for the new system on your face, but that&#x27;s not the case here.  Philips Norelco stands by the product, even offering a full refund (of course with your original receipt) if you are not satisfied after using this shaving system for a full 21 days with no other implements.  They give you a challenge and I&#x27;ll bet you won&#x27;t think of sending it back.</li>
    <li> My dear husband has a Wildman Scottish beard. NOTHING can tame it short of a whip and chair or repeated daily shavings for a smooth face. Because he is a sales rep for a company and \\&quot;First Impressions\\&quot; really matter, he can&#x27;t grow out his beard because of the social stigma of them. He shaves sometimes 3-4 times per day just to keep his face clear of whiskers. By the end of the day, his facial skin is red and chafed from all the scratching that it&#x27;s encountered from his endless use of cheap/disposable razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s why I ordered this razor for my husband. Finding a public bathroom where he can shave and not be stared at, or worse yet...the DRY SHAVE...is a horrible thing to put your skin through on a daily basis. Neither he nor I have ever used an electric razor and when I saw the price, I blanched, never thinking that something as small and tiny as a razor could cost so much. But, to quote that old adage, \\&quot;You Get What You Pay For\\&quot;, so based on this price, it must be something special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it is! There was a learning curve with transferring from a hand razor to an electric one but after trying all the settings and finding out how to hold it to get the best shave, my husband is sold! He loves that he can carry it with him and use it before every meeting, looking clean, sharp and professional each time. He was ecstatic when he found it that it self-cleans, too, since shaving in your truck isn&#x27;t conducive to fussing with cleaning a shaver head. It holds a charge all day long and is used 4-5 times a day without any diminished power. And the very sturdy carrying case is great for tossing in the glove box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading a review by Amelia about wire-ry facial hair on women, I also gave it a try and was literally tickled to see what it felt like but also how it zapped those nasty Old Lady Hairs that sprout up on my chinny-chin-chin. LOL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are better reviews than mine for all sorts of statistics, so I leave you to it to read those. Since I&#x27;m not the primary user of this razor, I wouldn&#x27;t even know how to go into particulars nor do I have any prior knowledge of electric razors. But, if reading a review about how well this works and travels away from home, than I hope my review helped you.those.

    <li> Too complicated for my husband.</li>
    <li> It pulls my hair when shaving. I feel uncomfortable. Actually it hurts somrtimes. My Braun 790cc is much more powerful and comfortable.</li>
    <li> Been awaiting to replace blade and razor- this fits the bills.</li>
    <li> This Philips Norelco 9300 shaver is replacing my first shaver from the same manufacturer, which I bought more than a decade ago, and that is still functional. I’d tried many shavers all these years, but I’ve always come back to my dear Philips Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new 9300 model got me in awe, because after so many years, the improvements are substantial. The first thing I noticed is that the new Philips Norelco makes very little noise, and the fact that I can use it for a wet shaving, it’s fantastic. The most amazing thing is that even in the highest setting it doesn’t cause any razor burn, while giving a very close shave. Almost as close as the leading manual razor, but I repeat, without the skin burning sensation. And this is great if one has to shave twice in the same day, for example, early in the morning and after work, before going to a date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next great fact about it, it’s how fast its battery charges, the first time it only takes about an hour, and after that, a quick five minutes charge can help you get rid of that five o’clock shadow in a rush. The SmartClean System included with it, cleans and maintains the shaver in optimal conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the hard travel case that comes with it; it’s perfect to carry both the shaver and the trimmer attachment. Speaking of which, my old Norelco had this attachment as a pop up feature embedded in the body of the shaver, which is handier, but the detached attachment is easier to use. Especially if one feels like using it to trim body hair. There is more control in the way to maneuver it and the grip on the shaver.</li>
    <li> Over the years, I&#x27;ve used a variety of Philips Norelco shavers and liked them all. The Series 9000, though, is a cut above the rest. With its contour detect technology, the heads move in up to eight directions cutting 20% more hair. The V-Track blades also cut closer to your skin, giving you a more complete shave. You&#x27;ll be very pleased with the smoothness once you&#x27;re done shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another nice feature is the ability to choose your speed to fit your facial hair and skin - fast, medium, or slow. Slow is nice for those who have sensitive skin or who are prone to getting a rash from shaving. The shaver also includes a cleaning cartridge, so that when you&#x27;re done shaving it cleans itself. All in all, this is a superior razor that you won&#x27;t be disappointed with. It provides a nice, clean, smooth shave that will last you all day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a razor kinda guy all my life. I&#x27;ve tried electric shavers off and on, but nothing in the last 15 years or so. I&#x27;ve just never liked the shave, preferring instead to rip my face apart with razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never loved the condition my skin was in post-razor-shave: dry, raw and prone to pimples, which I attribute to small in grown hairs. My greatest concern with a shaver is that the shave isn&#x27;t has fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this Norelco for 2 weeks. The documentation recommends a full 3 months before the total effect can be recognized. But so far, I love it. The shave isn&#x27;t as fine, but my post-shave face feels so much better, and the hassle factor is lessened as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning mechanism seems effective, but I&#x27;m wondering how frequently I&#x27;ll need to change the cleaning fluid. I&#x27;m still playing with the three shave speeds to see how that makes a difference to the shave itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this item via the Amazon Vine program.</li>
    <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;•New V-Track Precision Blades hug the contours of my face much better than previous models like the Sensotouch 2D &amp; 3D&lt;br /&gt;•Trimmer included as a separate head&lt;br /&gt;•Battery life is very good, easily lasts 2 weeks for me&lt;br /&gt;•Shaves better than previous model, only tested wet shaving although you can use it dry as well&lt;br /&gt;•Has 3 speeds, but I primarily used the fastest speed and it did not cause any irritation&lt;br /&gt;•Grip is designed well, will not slip out of your hand when its wet&lt;br /&gt;•Cleaning systems holds the shaver upside down so that it can dry between uses&lt;br /&gt;•Cleaning system was easy to use and doubled as charging stand.&lt;br /&gt;•includes a travel case&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;•Only one charge cable supplied, if you travel you have to keep disconnecting it from the cleaning station to take with you.&lt;br /&gt;•Cleaning station briefly turns the shaver on and off during cleaning, it can be noisy and has a few flashing lights. Do not set it to clean right before bed or it can be disruptive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this razor and I will continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never had an electric shaver with a cleaning station before and while I like the thought of it I do not like the cost.  You could buy the lower end model for a lot less money without the cleaning station and probably be just as happy with the results. Batteries get weak over time, technology gets better and things break so it is hard to justify investing so much in a single device that gets replaced every few years. The blades should be replaced once a year the same as any electric razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned a bunch of different Norelco and similar razors.  My last one was the 8000 series, which this 9300 replaces as the top-of-the-line razor.  Within the 9000 series, you can either choose this razor, or &amp;#34;upgrade&amp;#34; to the 9700, which offers touch sensitive controls and the jet-clean &amp;#34;pro&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 8000 series had the touch sensitive controls, and other than looks and a seamless design, functionally, they&#x27;re nearly identical.  I found I didn&#x27;t need a minute by minute count of remaining shave, and both are waterproof.  The same is true of the 9000 series razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most all of Norelco&#x27;s razors now use a detachable head unit, even the $60 multi-groom packages.  As you go up in price, you get a more powerful and longer lasting battery, better shaving heads, and a nicer design.  The good news, though, is that the heads are interchangeable, so if you&#x27;ve started out with a lower end, the attachments will fit the nicer razors.  Additionally, if you are looking at this razor but are wanting a better beard trimmer or the bodygroom head, you can order them separately and use them with this razor - no need to have two or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 9000 series promises a 30% closer shave vs. the 8000 series.  I had just replaced the head on my 8000 then was offered this razor.  I do feel like it shaves just a tad closer, but no way to quantify 30%.  It also has a 3-speed setting, which in reality is normal speed, plus two slower ones.  I don&#x27;t use this much, but for trouble areas it can be a bit less irritating to use a lower speed and go slower over those spots.  Also new to this series is the design of the heads.  You no longer have to replace the entire head unit, just the razor inserts.  The replacements seem a bit cheaper than the 8000&#x27;s.  It&#x27;s also easier to pop off the heads and clean out the shavings on this model, which is welcome.  The only potential downside is that the sideburn trimmer is no longer integrated into this razor, but comes as a separate head.  Therefore, you have to pop off the razor head and attach the trimmer to use it.  That said, the trimmer on the 8000 was nearly useless and this one is much better.  Also, with the 9000, you can charge it either directly at the bottom of the razor, or by putting it in the cleaning system.  The 8000 could only be charged when in its stand, which really sucked for travelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning system is really cool.  The razor is placed upside-down in it and the reserviour will fill and drain with cleaning solution several times.  Then it will fill and run the razors while in solution, then drain.  This repeats several times, then the reservoir drains allowing it to dry.  By default, you&#x27;re supposed to push down on the cleaning arm to lock the razor in place while cleaning.  This also tells it when to run during the cycle.  You actually don&#x27;t have to do this if all you want is the fill and drain.  I like this because I like to run the razor&#x27;s battery down before charging.  Even without the cycle where the razor runs while in the solution, it gets completely clean. Another nice touch is that the cleaning solution cartridge has a little filter in it, which keeps the previous shaving from circulating in the solution.  Overall, the system works really well and keeps hard water deposits and other gunk from dulling the razor heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, there are some nice upgrades from the 8000 series.  While not essential, they are nice.  Also, I really like that the razor can be charged directly rather than only on the stand.  Last but not least, the replacement heads are a cheaper price on the newer models.s a separate head.  Therefore, you have to pop off the razor head and attach the trimmer to use it.

    <li> Great shaver but everything else about it is awful. The Smartclean only works on occasion and even then, not so well. I had four of them!  I was willing to rinse the shaver under the water, just because it is that good.  The orange plastic device, designed to seat the blades was worthless. I thought to myself, well I&#x27;ll just spend $50 a year to never have to touch that orange tool. Nope, if you want the head, already assembled, it&#x27;s about $75 on Amazon, so...  I put the super shaving machine away, and took out the razor and gel. However, I&#x27;m not looking forward to tomorrow morning. Sorry Philips. Design flaw not acknowledged. Not nice.</li>
    <li> This Norelco shaver is one of the wet-dry variety and works quite well both ways. The shaver is lightweight and easy to use, recharges&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;quickly and is easy to clean and maintain. Though the cleaning base takes up a big piece of real estate on the bathroom counter. At&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;price point I probably would not buy one for myself, but it is a really nice item.</li>
    <li> lt is very nice and this time the price is good</li>
    <li> I first got this electric razor back in Oct. 14 when  9000 Series first came out. It was AWFUL! NO WAY did it shave as good as SensoTouch3d! It took 20 mins to get anything even resembling a close shave and 2 hrs after I shaved, it looked like, I hadn&#x27;t shaved at all! Well things have changed! With all the negative reviews Philips was getting for this razor they realized that they had messed up big time with the SH90 blades sooo they upgraded their blades from SH90 to SH90/62! All new 9000 Series electric razors come with SH90/62 blades. SH90/62 are excellent! They shave as close as the old SensoTouch 3d blades. I bought some SH90/62 blades and put them in my 9300 and I am now getting a blade close shave shave! SH90/62 blades shave nearly close as a blade! It&#x27;s about time Philips did something to improve the awful shaves of this razor!!!! Philips will prob release a new Top of The Line Razor latter this year just in time for Christmas. Until something better comes out, I&#x27;m happy with my 9300!d last a long time. I believe that you can get 3 at Walmart for around $11. This is a very expensive razor. It comes with all the bells and whistles of a Top of The Line Philips Norelco except the digital minute readout which in my opinion is unecessary unless you want to spend $100 more for it. It also comes with a travel case which is much nicer than the SensoTouch 3d travel case. I like this razor and use it on a regular bases. It makes a great gift and I recommend the Philips Norelco 9300.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on junk like this!  The replacement blades will also cost a fortune.  I was always the biggest fan of Norelco and Philips.  I have only used their shavers for more than 25 years.  However, I have had enough of their new inferior shavers.  The old 7800 models wet/dry were great but the current ones are flimsy and does not shave well.  I bought this model because the replacement blades on the prior model (which was just as bad as this one) costs the same as this new shaver.  The head and blades are not well designed  -  the red plastic inside on one of the blades keeps on coming loose. The space age design does not work well at all.  The older more sturdier design worked well.  I had this shaver for about 9 months and it does not give a clean shave - takes a lot of time.  My son bought a Braun 340-S for $39 and the replacement blades cost only about 20.  The Braun is sturdy and well designed and shave clean.  Having spent about $160 average on Norelco space agrer shavers, I am buying the $39 Braun right now on Amazon.  Goodbye Norelco.</li>
    <li> Upgraded from a budget Norelco model to this.  Was a bit hesitant due to price. I am a believer now. Comparatively speaking I feel like i was shaving with rusty barbed wire before.</li>
    <li> I purchased my S9311/84WM off the Bay as there was a better pricing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s great value that you get 2 bonus cleaning cartridges and the Smartclick beard styler in addition to the standard sideburn trimmer shown in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I previously owned the Arcitec shaver with an upgraded Sensotouch 3D shaver head, which included a jetclean system thingy.  I would have been happy to replace the 3D shaver head, but those now priced to make it practical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new 9000 series shaver is a nice upgrade to the Arcitec/Sensotouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Much more quiet vs previous versions.&lt;br /&gt;2. Much more light, and smart shiny looking unit.&lt;br /&gt;3. Comes with a nice carry pouch, which is very useful if you travel frequently.&lt;br /&gt;4. You can charge this by plugging directly (110-240v), instead of having to use the jet clean system or charging stand.&lt;br /&gt;5. Feels nice in the hand as you shave.&lt;br /&gt;6. The jetclean unit itself is smaller, more compact than the previous version i had. Also, I like the cartridge approach (vs open container), which should experience less evaporation.  Once I&#x27;ve used up all 3 of the supplied cleaning cartridges, i intend to produce my own home-brew cleaning solution using isopropyl alcohol and lubricating oil (see google for recipe).&lt;br /&gt;7. I like the 3 speed settings, although i think i&#x27;ll always have it on 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes - it does shave closer as claimed, compared to my current Sensotouch 3D shaver head.  I have no means of quantifying how much closer by %, but it does feel like a closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One question mark is that the shaver does not come with a shaver head guard. All the previous Philips shavers i have owned (3 of them) have always had a guard/protector.  I don&#x27;t know why this practice has stopped. Possibly because it comes with a  carry case, and you&#x27;re expected to keep the shaver in the carry case at all times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would i recommend this shaver? Yes!</li>
    <li> My husband was the tester for this product and his comments are framed in his deep affection for the Norelco brand. He&#x27;s always used a Norelco because of the quality and durability. This 9300 series shaver was definitely a step in the right direction for the brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-The shaver charges very fast.&lt;br /&gt;-It holds a charge for a good amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;-The shaver comes with a very nice travel case.&lt;br /&gt;-The rounded heads move in more directions (I believe it&#x27;s advertised as 8 different directions) and gives a much closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;-The rounded heads also move independently of each other so the shave is close on the first swipes so you don&#x27;t have to keep going over the area- particularly the contours of the jaw and throat. This is great for a man with skin sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;-The \\&quot;+\\&quot; and \\&quot;-\\&quot; buttons give you the option of speed in order to deal with sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;-The shaver has a separate attachment for the side burn trimmer. In previous models, it used to be on the flip side of the shaver. Now you have to take off the heads and put on the side burn attachment. While not necessarily a deal breaker, it does cut down on the efficiency of the shaver. But it is a wider attachment than in older models.&lt;br /&gt;-The packaging isn&#x27;t Amazon Frustration Free! My husband commented on that as he was taking out the umpteenth piece of unnecessary cardboard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is definitely worth the extra money, especially if you want a quality product that will last a long time.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what I expected, but I didn&#x27;t get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve discovered that Philips Norelco has a secret obsolescence tactic. You buy this nice new razor, and it works great. After a year, you buy replacement blades, and it works great once again. After two years, you buy another set of blades, but they don&#x27;t seem to work as well as the ones you take out for some reason. That&#x27;s right, after 2 years, Norelco starts shipping dull blades for your model to convince you to buy a &amp;#34;new improved&amp;#34; shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using them for many decades, and this has held true since the 1990&#x27;s that I can remember, probably longer.</li>
    <li> There is a lot to love about this electric shaver.  The quality and build are a cut above and it really does a beautiful job of providing a close shave (tested on legs as well as having some feedback from a man in the household).  This has a cool disinfectant system called the &amp;#34;SmartClean&amp;#34; system that with a simple push of the button cleans all of the shaver heads with it&#x27;s own solution.  I am unsure how long the solution tank will last but it will require that refills that as of this writing, I am unable to find on Amazon.  The Braun Series 7 has a similar system for less money but it&#x27;s entirely different type of shaver altogether.  It&#x27;s nice to know that the disinfecting option is out there among other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is really nice, but at a $250 price point you will need to decide i the entire disinfecting system is worth it.  The shaver feels solid in the hand and offers a nice quick charge.  In 3 minutes, you can have a charge for about one shave if time is tight.  The value in this shaver is really seen with the flexibility and pivot of the heads.  They can really hug curves on the face, head or legs.  A nice close shave without a burn or irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me, it seems like quite an expensive option.  There are cheaper shavers out there that may be as good as this one.  I encourage a bit of research and deciding what you need.  This shaver comes with an extra attachment for longer whiskers and a small clamshell case.</li>
    <li> An absolute disappointment in every department.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched from a Braun (same price level) and this razor is inferior to that on every level.  It gets a second star because it does do what it says on the box (gives you a shave) but that is where it ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole feel of it compared to the Braun is one of cheapness and low quality.  The Braun feels substantial and weighty where this feels light and chintzy.  Turn on the Braun and it feels like it has some power behind it.  The Norelco feels so insubstantial with a pathetic little whine of the motor that barely sounds like it is spinning anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The closeness of the shave is inferior to the Braun.  It does a little better at getting hair lying flat around the neck but with the Braun a quick pass with the built-in trimmer solves that problem.  Apart from that the Braun gives a closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer on the Norelco is separate so you have to stop the shaver.  Swap heads and start again.  The Braun it is there the whole time whenever you want it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, charging a large premium for a digital display on the premier model is offensive when it is in all other respects the same shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no way this shaver is worth its asking price.  If they sold it for $50 it might be worthwhile.  Personally I wouldn&#x27;t even pay that much for it.</li>
    <li> Above average.  Not stellar.  If you keep it for 2 or 3 years...worth it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this 9300 when it first came out and used it for two months. This model does not improve on the model it replaces. It is very clear the goal of this model was to cut manufacturing cost. The built in trimmer which was very convenient has been removed. Instead, you must remove the shaver head and plug in a new very cheap feeling trimmer. Second, the actual shaving head doesn&#x27;t improve on the old one and isn&#x27;t as easy to clean. The newer shaving heads tug and pull whereas the original RQ12 did not. That is what I liked about the Norelco over Braun 7 and Panasonic Arc 5. I didn&#x27;t have to trim down my facial hair with a trimmer first then shave but the newer heads pull and tug. The speed setting is useless. You will always use it on full power. The cleaning station uses cartridges similar to Braun. Notice how ALL 9000 series come with the cleaning station. Philips seeks to duplicate Braun&#x27;s money making model of selling the cartridges.    Really a shame Philips Norelco is taking a step back at the expense of the customer. I have tried other brands and decided to stick with the original Sensotouch 3D and have tried to buy the original replacement RQ12 which are no longer sold through traditional retail outlets.</li>
    <li> Close shave, head follows facial contours well, easy to clean</li>
    <li> This is the best electric shaver I have used.  My review will be based on comparisons to the electric shaver this Philips Norelco 9300 unit has replaced, which is the Braun Series 7. This review has three components;  Shaver Review, Cleaning Unit Review and 9300 Shaving Technique Tips&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaver Review:&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line:&lt;br /&gt;This Philips Norelco 9300 shaves much closer and much more thoroughly than the Braun Series 7 model.  Note that I&#x27;ll occasionally use the abbreviation PN to represent Phillips Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was satisfied with the closeness of the shave provided by the Braun Series 7, but the Braun unit missed too many hairs on the neck and jawline areas. Too many missed hairs motivated the search for a more thorough electric shave.  Upon first use of the 9300, I immediately noticed that not only does the PN 9300 shave much closer, but it also shaves much more thoroughly on the neck and jawline areas.  The number of missed hairs on the neck region for the 9300 is very close to what you would achieve with a traditional razor.  I had been using the Braun series 7 for several years and was not used to the closeness of shave provided by the PN 9300.  The 9300 shaves so close that it feels like shaving with a razor, when compared to the Braun series 7.  Yes, you can also achieve razor-like burn on your lower neck with the 9300 if you apply too much pressure to the shaving head and do not keep the shaver head in constant motion.  I&#x27;ll further discuss PN 9300 shaving technique tips down below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, yes, the PN 9300 shaves very close and is very thorough.  I give the shaver itself 4.5 stars.  The missing half star is due to the fact that you have to manually disconnect the shaving head assembly and then attach the included sideburns trimmer each time you want to trim your sideburns.  This may seem like a small thing, but repeated, daily motions consume time and provide opportunities for breakage.  I don&#x27;t trust plastic parts holding up to the daily wear and tear of being snapped into and out of place over and over.  I have a separate small, Philips Norelco hair trimmer that I use for the sideburns trimming job.  However, don&#x27;t let that design aspect deter you from experiencing this very effective electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking to try an electric shaver for the first time, then let this be the model you choose. Yes, old fashioned razors still provide the closest, most thorough shave, but the savings provided by an electric shaver in terms of reduced shaving time, no mess to clean up, no more facial cuts and no more razor/shaving creme purchasing vastly outweigh the very minor trade-off in shaving performance.  I haven&#x27;t cut my face while shaving in many years and never plan on doing so again.  To me, razors are old technology similar to vinyl records and leeches.  After five weeks of PN 9300 ownership, I&#x27;m very satisfied with the shaving performance.  And yes, you do need to follow the 30 day skin-adjustment period rule when switching from razors to electric shavers before passing judgement on an electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking to upgrade from another electric shaver model, go with the Philips Norelco 9300 shaver. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.  I had thought foil-based electric shavers were the best, but was mistaken.  The flexibility, articulation and degrees of freedom engineered into the PN 9300 shaving heads provide the closest and most thorough electric shave I&#x27;ve been able to get.  The Braun Series 7 just doesn&#x27;t have enough flexibility and articulation built into the shaving head to do a thorough job of shaving all of the hairs on your neck.  I didn&#x27;t realize I was walking around for years with a not so close AND not so thorough Braun Series 7 shave until I tried the Philips 9300.  The Philips unit is also much quieter than the the Braun unit. The Philips emits a light, whirring sound whereas the Braun emits a louder, higher-pitched buzz.  The first time I turned on the PN 9300 I wasn&#x27;t sure the thing was actually on.  Yes, it&#x27;s relatively quiet.  Both units feel well-balanced in the hand and of high quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning Unit Review: (updated 12-31-2016)&lt;br /&gt;*Begin Update-I give the 9300 cleaning unit 1.0 star.  I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that the cleaning unit is completely optional (i.e. unnecessary) as I end up cleaning the shaving head by removing the head cover and then running the heads under water.  For me, the cleaning unit now simply functions as a stand and charger.  The only way to remove the large amount of hair that accumulates behind the shaving head is to remove the shaving head cover from the shaver and empty the hair.  The cleaning unit just rinses the surface of the heads and has no effect on the hair that has accumulated behind the shaving head.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in shaving performance since rinsing with water.  The replacement head instructions also indicated to simply remove the head and run them under water. I&#x27;ve said so long to 4 hour cleaning cycles and the never ending replacement of cleaning fluid.  End Update 12-31-2016*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original cleaning unit review&lt;br /&gt;The Philips cleaning unit works well, but it takes a full 4 hours and 10 minutes to clean, lubricate, dry and charge the shaver. It takes 10 minutes to clean and lubricate and then almost 4 hours of drying time followed by a short period of charging. What happens if you remove the shaver from the cleaning unit before the 4 hour drying time has elapsed?  Well, the shaving heads are still wet from the cleaning fluid.  I prefer a dry shave, so this is somewhat annoying.  The Braun cleaning unit is designed better in terms of ease of use and it also provides a much shorter drying time. The benefits of the cleaning unit include convenience and time savings.  One simply presses a button to perform a cleaning, lubricating, drying and charging cycle.  I think Philips should aim for a 1/2 hour cycle time for the next version of this cleaning unit. 4 hours of drying time? Really?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t leave the cleaning unit constantly plugged in with the shaver in charging mode as I&#x27;m concerned about over-charging the battery, however, the 4 hour 10 minute cleaning and drying time isn&#x27;t that big a deal as you can simply start a cycle when you get home from work. 4 hours later, I unplug the cleaning unit and the shaver is clean, lubricated, dry and ready to go in the morning.  I use the cleaning unit about every other day.  My cleaning unit functioned as described in the manual for the first several weeks of ownership. The cleaning unit would run a ten minute clean/lubricate cycle and then go into drying mode for approximately four hours, then charge mode. The cleaning unit stopped operating in this manner near the fourth or fifth week of ownership and began to continuously switch back and forth between cleaning for ten minutes and then drying for ten minutes and then back to cleaning for ten minutes, etc... for hours on end.  I contacted Philips tech support concerning this behavior and a replacement cleaning unit has been received. I had to contact Philips support three times before the replacement was actually sent, so be prepared to followup as needed.  The replacement cleaning unit I received is of a newer design as evidenced by the ring of clear plastic around the top of the cleaning cartridge housing.  My original cleaning unit did not have this ring of clear plastic, so I&#x27;ll assume that the original unit was of an older design.  The replacement cleaning unit is working well and also comes with dashed lines that light up around the top of the cleaning cartridge housing to indicate where the unit is within a given clean/lubricate, dry, charge cycle.  In any event, in case your cleaning unit malfunctions, save your order confirmation email as proof of purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both the Braun and Philips cleaning units use 170 milliliter (ml) plastic reservoirs of cleaning fluid. Since both brands chose to use the same exact volume, I suspect competitive parity was the goal.  This cleaning fluid seems to evaporate over time and needs to be periodically replaced.  Yes, cleaning fluid replacement is a recurring revenue stream for both companies.  The Braun unit uses a sensor to measure cleaning fluid level and is  set to prompt the user to replace the cleaning fluid when a low fluid level is reached. The Philips cleaning unit claims to sense when the cleaning cartridge filter is full and prompts the user to replace the cleaning cartridge at this time.  I&#x27;ll be monitoring whether this is indeed the case or if perhaps the fluid level is simply being measured.  In any event, I&#x27;ve noticed similar cleaning fluid replacement rates between the Braun and Philips units. Philips claims each cleaning fluid container can last up to 2 months, which may mean the replacement time is dependent on how thick ones beard is, how frequently one shaves and how frequently one uses the cleaning unit. I&#x27;ll experiment with this to determine what the Philips cleaning unit is actually sensing inside the cleaning cartridge. **Update**. I&#x27;ve determined that the Philips Norelco cleaning unit simply measures the level of the cleaning fluid remaining in the cartridge rather than sensing the condition of the &amp;#34;filter&amp;#34; inside the cartridge. When the cleaning unit indicated that the cleaning cartridge needed to be replaced, I added a small amount of water to the old cleaning cartridge and reinserted it into the cleaning unit.  Sure enough, the cleaning unit operated as designed.  Don&#x27;t use water long-term, however, as this may not lubricate properly.  This information suggests limiting the evaporation of the cleaning fluid from the cartridge will extend the life of the cleaning cartridge.  I&#x27;ll try removing and covering the cleaning cartridge when it&#x27;s not in use to see if this helps extend the life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also worth noting that the Braun cleaning fluid is alcohol-based, which may mean the Braun cleaning fluid disinfects the shaver as well whereas the Philips cleaning fluid is &amp;#34;alcohol free&amp;#34; and may simply clean without disinfecting.  The Philips cleaning fluid lubricates as well, whereas the Braun unit includes a separate small container of oil to be occasionally manually applied for lubrication purposes.  Also, the Philips cleaning unit is much more quiet than the Braun cleaning unit, which emits a fairly loud buzz, but nothing unbearable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as long-term maintenance goes, the Philips 9300 will require more manual cleaning time due to the more complex design of the rotary shaving heads. By long-term maintenance, I mean removal of the three shaving heads from the shaver assembly for a more thorough hair removal and cleaning.  A thorough cleaning of the Braun shaving head is simple, fast and easy to do with the included hair removal brush. It would have been nice had Philips included a similar hair removal brush.  The PN 9300 includes a shaving head removal tool (it&#x27;s the orange plastic part, so don&#x27;t throw it out!) and Philips notes that each of the 3 shaving heads must be placed back in the original location from which each was removed (maintain cutter/comb pairing) for optimal shaver performance.  In other words, clean one Philips shaving head at a time.  It took about 15 minutes to perform the thorough shaving head cleaning on the Philips unit the first time through. That time will dramatically decrease with familiarity.  Yes, the very flexible PN 9300 shaving head design is more complex than the Braun head and thus requires more disassembling/reassembling time.  A thorough cleaning of the Braun shaving head takes about one minute.  For the Braun unit, I performed this more thorough cleaning each time the cleaning fluid was replaced. I&#x27;ll likely follow the same more thorough cleaning schedule with the PN 9300.  You&#x27;ll find a decent amount of hair building up inside the PN 9300 shaving head assembly, so I&#x27;d perform the more thorough cleaning at least every three months or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving Technique Tips when using the Philips Norelco 9300:&lt;br /&gt;1. Maintain constant circular motion.  Always keep the shaver heads moving in a circular path via a series of overlapping circles. One can alternate between using clockwise (CW) or counterclockwise (CCW) circles.  Either direction works fine, but I notice a mixture of using both CW and CCW circles maximizes shaving performance since the direction of hair growth can vary. The size (diameter) of your circles can be roughly the same size (or smaller but not larger) as the size of the circle that encompasses all three shaving heads. To achieve more precision near the sideburns, aim one of the three shaving heads at the targeted area and use very small diameter circles to approximate a straight edge. Adjust circle size and direction as needed using your eyes and ears to monitor shaving effectiveness.  Over time, you&#x27;ll come to notice a different sound being emitted when hairs are actually being shaved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. To shave the upper and lower lip areas, reverse pucker, as in pull your lips in on themselves, and then glide the shaving head left and right in a circular motion. The reverse pucker (pursed lips) essentially creates a single, larger skin surface roughly equivalent to one of your cheek areas. Think of the area extending from under your nose to the bottom of your chin as a single surface similar to a cheek.  Move the shaver over this area as if the lips did not exist.  This allows you to use the same circular shaving technique on the lip area as is used on the cheek area. In order to shave the hard-to-reach hairs under your nose, aim one of the three shaving heads at those hairs and use very small diameter circles to catch them with your one chosen shaving head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. For the lower neck area, use a very light pressure on the shaver head while keeping it moving in constant circular motion.  The pressure being applied to the shaver head has a big effect on lower neck area skin irritation, whereas pressure applied doesn&#x27;t seem to matter on the cheek, lip or upper neck areas.  I haven&#x27;t experienced any skin irritation in those areas, regardless of the pressure being applied.  Don&#x27;t let the shaving heads remain stationary in the same area of lower neck skin for very long or you will experience razor burn/skin irritation. Yes, it shaves that close.  Also, I find that keeping the skin loose on the lower neck, rather than pointing the chin up to tighten the lower neck skin, helps prevent razor burn.  You can also experiment with using the three different shaving head rotation speeds (rpm) on the lower neck area.  Lower rotation speeds allow for more pressure to be applied and vice versa.  When shaving the lower neck area you should basically be aware of the pressure being applied to the shaving head, the tightness of skin on the neck and the shaver rotation speed being used.  Adjust any of those variables as needed to achieve a close, thorough, irritation-free lower neck shave.ose to use the same exact volume, I suspect competitive parity was the goal.  This cleaning fluid seems to evaporate over time and needs to be periodically replaced.  Yes, cleaning fluid replacement is a recurring revenue stream for both companies.  The Braun unit uses a sensor to measure cleaning fluid level and is  set to prompt the user to replace the cleaning fluid when a low fluid level is reached. The Philips cleaning unit claims to sense when the cleaning cartridge filter is full and prompts the user to replace the cleaning cartridge at this time.  I&#x27;ll be monitoring whether this is indeed the case or if perhaps the fluid level is simply being measured.  In any event, I&#x27;ve noticed similar cleaning fluid replacement rates between the Braun and Philips units. Philips claims each cleaning fluid container can last up to 2 months, which may mean the replacement time is dependent on how thick ones beard is, how frequently one shaves and how frequently one uses the cleaning unit. I&#x27;ll experiment with this to determine what the Philips cleaning unit is actually sensing inside the cleaning cartridge. **Update**. I&#x27;ve determined that the Philips Norelco cleaning unit simply measures the level of the cleaning fluid remaining in the cartridge rather than sensing the condition of the &amp;#34;filter&amp;#34; inside the cartridge. When the cleaning unit indicated that the cleaning cartridge needed to be replaced, I added a small amount of water to the old cleaning cartridge and reinserted it into the cleaning unit.  Sure enough, the cleaning unit operated as designed.  Don&#x27;t use water long-term, however, as this may not lubricate properly.  This information suggests limiting the evaporation of the cleaning fluid from the cartridge will extend the life of the cleaning cartridge.  I&#x27;ll try removing and covering the cleaning cartridge when it&#x27;s not in use to see if this helps extend the life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also worth noting that the Braun cleaning fluid is alcohol-based, which maymean the Braun cleaning fluid disinfects the shaver as well whereas the Philips cleaning fluid is &amp;#34;alcohol free&amp;#34; and may simply clean without disinfecting.  The Philips cleaning fluid lubricates as well, whereas the Braun unit includes a separate small container of oil to be occasionally manually applied for lubrication purposes.  Also, the Philips cleaning unit is much more quiet than the Braun cleaning unit, which emits a fairly loud buzz, but nothing unbearable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as long-term maintenance goes, the Philips 9300 will require more manual cleaning time due to the more complex design of the rotary shaving heads. By long-term maintenance, I mean removal of the three shaving heads from the shaver assembly for a more thorough hair removal and cleaning.  A thorough cleaning of the Braun shaving head is simple, fast and easy to do with the included hair removal brush. It would have been nice had Philips included a similar hair removal brush.  The PN 9300 includes a shaving head removal tool (it&#x27;s the orange plastic part, so don&#x27;t throw it out!) and Philips notes that each of the 3 shaving heads must be placed back in the original location from which each was removed (maintain cutter/comb pairing) for optimal shaver performance.  In other words, clean one Philips shaving head at a time.  It took about 15 minutes to perform the thorough shaving head cleaning on the Philips unit the first time through. That time will dramatically decrease with familiarity.  Yes, the very flexible PN 9300 shaving head design is more complex than the Braun head and thus requires more disassembling/reassembling time.  A thorough cleaning of the Braun shaving head takes about one minute.  For the Braun unit, I performed this more thorough cleaning each time the cleaning fluid was replaced. I&#x27;ll likely follow the same more thorough cleaning schedule with the PN 9300.  You&#x27;ll find a decent amount of hair building up inside the PN 9300 shaving head assembly, so I&#x27;d perform the more thorough cleaning at least every three months or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving Technique Tips when using the Philips Norelco 9300:&lt;br /&gt;1. Maintain constant circular motion.  Always keep the shaver heads moving in a circular path via a series of overlapping circles. One can alternate between using clockwise (CW) or counterclockwise (CCW) circles.  Either direction works fine, but I notice a mixture of using both CW and CCW circles maximizes shaving performance since the direction of hair growth can vary. The size (diameter) of your circles can be roughly the same size (or smaller but not larger) as the size of the circle that encompasses all three shaving heads. To achieve more precision near the sideburns, aim one of the three shaving heads at the targeted area and use very small diameter circles to approximate a straight edge.

    <li> This is a really good shaver. It gets a nice close shave (not completely bald though). It has a nice self-cleaning feature, and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> Ever since norelco moved their premium shavers to this new design where the heads are separated from the body of the shaver, the performance on these models has not been up up to par with the older style. I assume it has something to do with my curly hair and sadly un-chiseled hard to get to jaw line. I&#x27;m happy to report that this shaver does in fact reverse that trend. It works much better than the precious similar looking model, finally letting me believe the marketing hype of 30% better shave. It still for whatever reason doesn&#x27;t work quite as well as the panasonic or old style shavers they make, particularly on my neck area. Some of this is definitely a me issue, but also clearly has something to do with design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My other big issue with these shavers is it seems they haven&#x27;t got the wet performance quite right. I love the idea, as my skin is sensitive and with as many passes as these type razors can take, could benefit from more lubrication, but it seems as usually, whether using it in the shower, or with a shaving oil or foam, there performance suffers by clogging slits and it takes even longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the superior cutting, and ability to use it wet or dry, I really enjoy the self cleaning aspect of it. While it takes up more room than your gf/wife would like on the counter, it takes up less than I thought and is absolutely worth it. I&#x27;m a bit of a knife enthusiast. I lovingly tend to my shun kitchen knives, enjoy collecting other types of knives, and my favorite thing about camping is getting to chop and cut stuff. I have used safety razors and straight razors and loving investigating different types of steels for corrosion resistance or sharpness or hardness, etc. It has always bothered me tremendously at how overlooked that aspect of razors is. Keeping them dry, cleaning them off etc. In fact some people swear that if you leave your mach 3 type razor in mineral oil between uses you will easily get double the life from it. I dunno about the numbers but the science could work. So the fact that this razor has a system to both clean and dry both the little propeller type blades in there, and all the complicated machinery around it is a great feature to prolong the life of the blades. Because I think most of us aren&#x27;t changing our electric razor blades as often as recommended. I would like to know how it dries it though, because it just doesn&#x27;t seem to be loud enough to be getting the job done... (but it does come out dry.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly the reason this all around improved good looking razor gets 3 and not the 4 stars it might deserve, isn&#x27;t the recent bad luck I&#x27;ve had with my norelco batteries. I&#x27;ve had 3 razors in a row crap out their battery on me 1.5-2.5 years after receiving them. Two of them i even went to the trouble to replace and that was difficult, and both of those replacement batteries on two different razors died... one within to weeks, the other a year exactly later. Oh and I had a norelco body trimmer that after 2 years refused to charge. Meanwhile I still have a 5 year old panasonic razor going strong. It seems to me philips either doesn&#x27;t care or is purposely trying to get the life cycle of these products to about two years. Which considering a couple of the razors were in $200 range just isn&#x27;t ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So at the end of the day if your type of stubble is easily defeated by this  specific type of razor, and your old model is getting a little long in the tooth, this is a great upgrade. It looks good, it takes care of itself and has almost all the bells and whistles. You will see a definite improvement in cutting ability to boot. If however these types of razors don&#x27;t normally work for you and your currently using a manual razor or panasonic style razor don&#x27;t expect this to be the magic answer to your prayers. And as I mentioned earlier, I&#x27;ve deducted a point, either fairly or not, because I have substantiated doubts about the longevity of the battery.about the numbers but the science could work.

    <li> Philips Norelco S9311/84, 9300 Shaver&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First let me say that I&#x27;ve owned a number of Philips Norelco Shavers over the years and this is by far the best of them all.  Whoever came up with this product has put a great deal of time and thought into it.&lt;br /&gt;First some advice, write down the MODEL NUMBER and put it in a place where you can find it later.  I did not do this for the first Philips Norelco Shaver I bought and later regretted it.  If you ever need to buy replacement parts you&#x27;ll need the model number.  Since I did not do this I ended up buying the wrong replacement cutting blades.  I have never found any kind of razor that didn&#x27;t need to eventually buy replacement blades.  You use any blade you eventually have to sharpen it.  An electric razor with dull blades isn&#x27;t worth much.  Now maybe this one will last a very long time, but eventually...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the only bad thing that I found with this shaver.  It was difficult to open.  When I tried to get the shaver out of the personal carrying case that comes with it there was some kind of plastic string caught in the zipper.  I worried with this for about an hour before I eventually cut the plastic.  I couldn&#x27;t see a use for the plastic string (maybe it is for a retail price tag or something).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some of the features for this shaver that I like:&lt;br /&gt;-it has a LED display to let you know battery charge remaining.&lt;br /&gt;-- it has a \\&quot;smart clean \\&quot;base that cleans and lubricates the shaver&#x27;s blades&lt;br /&gt;-the alcohol base cleaner dries the shaver quickly&lt;br /&gt;The base charges the shaver automatically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Possibly the only criticism I could have is that the base has a rather large footprint.  It takes up an area on your sink of approximately 5 inches by 5 inches.  Not a problem for me, but then again, I&#x27;m not married to a wife who uses up all the space on the sink (well, not anymore anyhow).&lt;br /&gt;Home Depo and Lowe&#x27;s can solve your problem for you.&lt;br /&gt;If you have a bathroom vanity, Just shove some of the other stuff over a little to make room If you don&#x27;t have a vanity then you need to cut out a cardboard piece in a circle about 5 inches in diameter to see how much space you&#x27;ll need.  Maybe you can use a shelf or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here comes the really important part:&lt;br /&gt;HOW DOES IT SHAVE?&lt;br /&gt;  I first shaved with a two month old Remington foil shaver which I thought did a pretty good job, felt my whiskers, then shaved with this Baby  my whiskers felt like I had used a blade!  This thing might put an end to blade shaving!  Now I realize that it is a brand new shaver with brand new blades and a brand new lithium battery (lithium batteries are typically much more powerful than ordinary batteries).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically don&#x27;t comment on price. In this case I will.  I probably would not have paid full price for this product since it is obviously the Cadillac or Rolls Royce of shavers but now that I have experienced the shave I just might in the future if I ever have to replace this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this shaver for any man who wants a shave that is really as close as a blade and can afford the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gunner  September, 2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like my Christmas has come early this year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I should add.  I eventually noticed some very fine hairs on the fringes of my beard that were not being cut.  After I started using an electric shave product this problem was corrected.ake room If you don&#x27;t have a vanity then you need to cut out a cardboard piece in a circle about 5 inches in diameter to see how much space you&#x27;ll need.

    <li> My \\&quot;go to\\&quot; razor is similar to this one.  I use the [[ASIN:B006W2SYGM Philips Norelco 1280X/47 SensoTouch 3D Electric Razor]].  The Philips Norelco 9300 and the SensoTouch 3D  are both high end electric razors, pricing out over $200.  At this price, you want a razor that is dependable, comfortable, easy to use and maintain, and, something I&#x27;ve learned recently, quiet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My review takes two parts.  For the first part, I used the SensoTouch 3D on one side of my face, and the 9300 on the other side.  Afterwards, how does it feel?  The SensoTouch 3D has one speed while the 9300 has three (I tried all the speeds).  For whatever reason, I preferred the one speed in the the SensoTouch 3D.  My skin didn&#x27;t feel different after the shaves, but during the shaves - and I thought very hard whether I was imagining this - the SensoTouch 3D felt smoother against my skin (really a function of the ease of the cutting, I think).  For both razors, compared to my old Braun razor, these razors are extraordinarily quiet (they won&#x27;t wake up anyone up) and it feels like you are getting a mini-massage on your cheeks and neck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second part of this review looks at the razors operationally.  The SensoTouch 3D has a really inferior trimmer built in.  The 9300 trimmer comes as a separate unit... better  trimmer, but you have to look for (or lug around) that extra piece.  Winner, SensoTouch 3D.  In the SensoTouch 3D, each cutter blade opens for dumping out hair pieces.  For the 9300, you have to pull off all three heads.  Tie.  In the SensoTouch 3D, you have to use a special stand in order to recharge your battery.  When traveling, you have to carry the stand and cord around as well.  With the 9300, you can plug the cord directly into the razor without a stand.  Winner, 9300.  Both units have this convoluted cleaning system; I wonder how much the price could be reduced if the cleaning system was simplified.  I suspect replacement blades cost the same, between 40 and 50 dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m sticking with my SensoTouch 3D.  With that said, I really have nothing negative to say about the 9300 overall.  It&#x27;s a great razor, and I hope that if you look at your face as a long-term investment, it might be worthy of a nice electric razor.I&#x27;m sticking with my SensoTouch 3D.

    <li> Great shave and is amazingly quite. Thought it was expensive but now that I have used it, think it is worth the price.</li>
    <li> Shaves O.K. ,Inside clips that hold cutting heads in, unhook occasingly, this is a problem.</li>
    <li> This razor was bought to replace a older Norelco razor which was top of the line 5-6 years ago. This cost a lot more than most of the models but it does a great job. Nice close clean shaves. Came with extras but it did not come with a plastic cover to put over the head when not in use.</li>
    <li> Though more than I ever thought I&#x27;d spend for a razor, you do get what you pay for.  I have always preferred the Norelco razors, my first was in 1972, and this is one of the best.  Easy to use, and easy to clean.  It takes a bit to setup - not 100% intuitive.  Using the separate trimmer was initially less than desirable but with the design a built-in wouldn&#x27;t be possible.  The cleaning system does a great job - I use it about once a week when I recharge the razor.</li>
    <li> Four years ago my husband went from using $50 Norelco electric razors to a very nice Philips Norelco 1290X/46 Shaver 8800. Since then he&#x27;s been hooked on them, and was eager to get and use the new 9300 shaver, to replace his very well used 8800 version. His 8800 has worked awesome all these years and still does, but with constantly daily use, it&#x27;s starting to get a bit worn. He&#x27;s frequently commented that these shavers provide the the best possible shave he can get, short of a blade. But the advantage to these is a blade can on occasion cause irritation of the skin, and these do not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He had high expectations of this new model, and it has met all of them. It gives him a great smooth shave without pulling or irritating his skin. When he&#x27;s does he can just set it in it&#x27;s charging base and it is ready for him the next time he uses it. And it holds a large charge, so you really don&#x27;t need to charge it every time you use it. One shave only uses a small percent of the battery. So you can go several days and get many shaves out of just a single charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rotating heads angle and pivot around, so the shaver is able to closely shave even along the chine line with ease. And Norelco does sell replacement heads for these, so when the blades get a bit dull, you can pop them off and replace them with a new one. In the 4 years we had the 8800 model, we replaced the head on it twice, I believe. One thing you may want to take note of is the replacement heads for these high end Norelco razors cost as much as one of the more budget priced Norelco razors. But the 8800 and the 9300 are long-time-use investment razors, instead of being a more disposable version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 8800 my husband has had for four years now is now kept in locker at work. He has a locker room where changes in and out of his uniform, and there is also a gym and shower room there. He keeps his older but still working 8800 there, and this new 9300 version at home for his regular daily use. These are wonderful razors, and after switching to these from the budget versions, he&#x27;s never wanted to use anything else!These are wonderful razors, and after switching to these from the budget versions, he&#x27;s never wanted to use anything else!</li>
    <li> My husband is a safety razor man. It&#x27;s been a rare few times that I&#x27;m managed to entice him away from his shaving razor and shaving cream. A $250 electric razor? That did the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a man who has spent a lifetime shaving with both safety razors and electric razors, the Norelco 9300 shaver worked as well as an electric razor can, my husband said - but that still isn&#x27;t saying much. The three head floating blades do a workmanlike job of trimming the beard, and it isn&#x27;t bad in the shower (this razor can be used in and out of water.) He prefers using it on a dry beard, with a lubricant to take some of the electric razor sting out of the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor runs on a rechargeable battery (which takes up a nice chunk of bath room counter real estate), and it charges easily and relatively quickly. The shave itself is &amp;#34;not bad, not bad at all,&amp;#34; my husband said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He doubts, though, that it&#x27;s not $250 good, and he added, it&#x27;s not going to be good enough to convert a blade man to electric shaving, esp. not at that price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If a loved one loves electric shavers, and price isn&#x27;t an object, my husband said this will make a great gift. Otherwise? Wait for a sale.</li>
    <li> Had an issue with the charger going non-stop and cleaning it without me pushing the button. Called Philips and they sent a replacement that has been working ever since. They had good customer support. The shaver itself is great, and I have absolutely 0 complaints. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I have always used Norelco shavers. This one is the best. So far I love it.</li>
    <li> Good shave,very quiet, takes a little longer than my old Braun. Touchy cleaner re placement of razor.</li>
    <li> As you can probably figure out from its price tag, this [[ASIN:B00M1E54Q8 Philips Norelco S9311/87, Shaver 9300]] is kind of like the Mercedes-Benz of electric shavers. (Although, I was surprised to discover that the same company makes the [[ASIN:B00M1E55HQ Philips Norelco S9721/87,  Shaver 9700]] that costs about $100.00 *more* than this one!)    From the moment you lay your hands on this shaver, you know it&#x27;s built well. It feels substantial and of high-quality, which is important; it likely means it will last a long time. At the same time, the shaver is not overly heavy in your hand.    Everything about the 9300 is easy: from charging (1 hour of charging for 50 minutes of shaving time, or a quick 3-minute charge for one shave); to seeing the status of the battery (big, bright LED display right on the front); to actually shaving (turn it on, pick a speed--it&#x27;s nice to have three choices--and enjoy the comfort). Everything&#x27;s a piece of cake with this beautiful instrument.    Believe me, the 9300 gives a *great* shave. I have experienced no discomfort at all. No pulling of hairs, no pinching, etc. And the final shave is pretty darn close to the shave you can get with a razor, whether you use the 9300 wet or dry. But there are a couple of things--besides the price--that I&#x27;m not too crazy about.    First of all, having the trimmer be a separate piece that you have to attach separately is incredibly inconvenient. I think every other electric shaver I&#x27;ve used over the years has had the trimmer built in. Maybe the \\&quot;click-on\\&quot; trimmer is something I&#x27;ll get used to, but right now it&#x27;s just frustrating. It trims well...it&#x27;s just irritating to have to put it on and take it off.    I&#x27;m also not a big fan of the whole \\&quot;SmartClean\\&quot; charging/cleaning system. The base takes up a lot of bathroom counter space, and if your bathroom counter is anything like mine, there&#x27;s not a whole lot of real estate left after you account for the soap, the wife&#x27;s \\&quot;stuff,\\&quot; the electric toothbrush stand/charger, etc. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the \\&quot;alcohol-free, skin-friendly formula\\&quot; that lives in the SmartClean base does a great job of cleaning and lubricating the razor. But the cartridge that contains that magic liquid won&#x27;t last forever and will need to be replaced regularly. It&#x27;s too soon to tell how long the cartridge will actually last, and I can&#x27;t find replacements on Amazon yet. But some searching on the Internet turned up 2-packs of replacement cartridges for about $25.00. That&#x27;s not cheap!    Yes, you can charge the razor without a cartridge in the base (thank goodness), but then you&#x27;ll wish you just had a simple charging cord you could plug into the shaver to recharge it, instead of the clunky base.    As I type this review, the [[ASIN:B00CP4H3T0 Philips Norelco PT724/41 Philips Powertouch Electic Razor]] is the #2 selling electric shaver at Amazon. It&#x27;s got more than 300 reviews, averages 4.3 stars, and is under 40 bucks. So I guess you have to ask yourself if you want to pay about six times that price to get the Philips Norelco 9300. In this day and age, where \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot; is more and more true, maybe you do. I, on the other hand, am pretty frugal. Although I love the 9300, I would likely opt for a more inexpensive option.</li>
    <li> I have been paying for razor cartridges for a couple of decades now, and would really like an electric shaver that could give me a comfortable, close shave without the recurring costs.  Regrettably, I&#x27;ve never been able to find one.  Even after trying this (admittedly well-built) shaver, I still haven&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fairly sensitive skin, I guess, because I have never  been able to keep up a shave-every-day regimen without causing a pretty dramatic breakout on my face.  For the longest time, I&#x27;ve been keeping a MWF shave schedule, and just accepting the TuThSaSu scruff as the price of avoiding bright red razor burn.  Thankfully, I can get away with a day&#x27;s growth at my job, as  a day&#x27;s growth on me isn&#x27;t really all that messy a look.  Shaving a two- or three-day beard with a Mach3 and a wet face is a quick, easy, painless process, and I get good life out of my blades (around two weeks) just by stropping them on the bath towel around my waist as I go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first tried this shaver, it was a Monday morning, and I hadn&#x27;t shaved over the weekend.  Although my beard doesn&#x27;t come in very very thick, three days of growth will get me some pretty long hairs, and this shaver just absolutely couldn&#x27;t handle them.  I started with dry skin (post-shower dry with a towel, but in a fairly humid bathroom), and could barely get a single hair cut.  I switched to the usual shave cream, which didn&#x27;t seem to help matters at all, even making it a little worse (As though the shave cream held the hair flush against the skin).  I gave up and switched to the Mach3, although the few moments of struggling with the shaver had already left me with pretty irritated skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried again on Wednesday with a two-day beard, and just with hot water right after the shower.  This time, it was able to catch and cut hairs, no pulling or pinching, but I had to keep circling over and over and over in the same spots to make any headway, and after five minutes of trying, had maybe thinned my two-day scruff by around 50%.  Giving up again, I got out the Mach3 and shaved away the rest in under a minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I&#x27;d try on Thursday, since the problem seemed to be with longer follicles, and it did seem to have an easier time with one-day scruff, but still would stubbornly refuse to cut down a noticeable amount on the more challenging jawline and lip spots.  I don&#x27;t have a lot of confidence that a follicle I miss one day will be easier to cut the next, given how it struggles with longer hairs, but I couldn&#x27;t just keep circling the same spot over and over indefinitely, as even on the slow speed, I could feel the skin growing irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, I just don&#x27;t have a face / beard that plays well with electric shavers.  I&#x27;d wondered before if perhaps it was because of the quality of the shavers I&#x27;d used in the past, but given how nice a build quality this Philips has, I no longer wonder if that&#x27;s the case.  If you&#x27;re like me, and have been disappointed by electric shavers in the past, you may not want to place too much hope in this one working better for you.  If you do like electrics, then this one has a really high-quality build, attractive aesthetic, confidence-inspiring cleaning station, and quality travel case.  But as to the most important feature of shave quality?  Well, this one just doesn&#x27;t work any better for me than anything else I&#x27;ve tried in the last 20 years.hinned my two-day scruff by around 50%.

    <li> I have used this electric shaver for over a month now, and absolutely love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I considered the top of the line electric shavers from Braun and Panasonic as well, but ultimately chose this one because of the sleek design, cheaper price, and compact size.  The more expensive brother model did not appeal to me because I didn&#x27;t like the digital number charge level readout and didn&#x27;t care for clean cycle progress indication.  I&#x27;ve researched and found that those two features were the only difference.  So I saved $100, and could not be happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took a few days for my skin to adjust to the shaver, and I now enjoy a very close and quick shave every day.  I feel it is worth the $199 I paid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say that the closeness of the shave is very close to a manual razor once you get used to using it.  But the real beauty of this thing is that it now only takes about 30 seconds for me to shave while the manual razor takes much longer.  The closeness of the shave and shaving time improves as you get used to the shaver and learn to do it better and quicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over time, I developed a few tips for future users of this shaver which I&#x27;ll share below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get a closer shave if you stretch the skin while shaving the area.  I find it useful to make exaggerated facial expressions while shaving. lol&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t have to clean/charge it every time.  I leave the base unit unplugged normally and only plug it in on the day I clean/charge it, which is about once every couple of weeks.  And I usually clean/charge the shaver when the battery level is down to 2/5.  The key to having the shaver head smelling nice and fresh without running the cleaning cycle every day is to simply take about 15 seconds after each use running the shaver under running water, taking the top of the head off and rinsing the inside of the head, and vigorously shaking the water off of the top and shaver before putting it back together and on the base.</li>
    <li> NOTE: Everyone is different when it comes to shaving. The kind of beard, the frequency of the shaving, the contour of the face, and the sensitivity of the skin will determine what kind of shaving you prefer. So this review is one man’s opinion of the product. Your experience may vary. This will be non-technical review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. TOP QUALITY. The price is indeed expensive as others have pointed out. But this is made from top quality materials [you could see &amp; feel] and is made in Netherlands. The motor is quiet but powerful enough to give you clean shaving.&lt;br /&gt;2. CLOSE SHAVING. First of all, NO electric shaver will give you an exact razor blade-close shave – just not possible (because razor blade actually touches your skin, while the electric blade is prevented from touching the skin by a foil). Example will be: Ink Jet printer claiming, “laser like print quality.” Having said that, I’ve tried this Norelco 9300 for a month (the manual said that if you are a razor blade user, then it takes 21 days for your face to get use to the electric shaver. Indeed, after 21 days or so, the shave was much more close and easier. Although it was not as close as my razor shaver (Gillette Fusion), it was close enough to feel clean and smooth using the highest speed setting. I’ve used other electric shaver in the past (Braun &amp; Remington), but Norelco indeed gave a slightly more close shave.&lt;br /&gt;3. COMFORTABLE. The shaver was comfortable to hold and maneuver. Because it is light, it was easy to move over the surface of the face. Using a circular motion, it covered larger areas more quickly.&lt;br /&gt;4. EASY TO USE. The display on the shaver was easy to read and the buttons were intuitive. It also tells you when it is needed to wash the foil and remove the excess hair residue through running faucet water. It can be used both wet and dry. I prefer dry, but you if want to use the shaving cream, you could also do so.&lt;br /&gt;5. “SMARTCLEAN” SYSTEM. It is bulky, but if you want your shaver to be fresh and clean, then this system works. You can also recharge the shaver while it is cleaning and conditioning it. Found it to be useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I must say that it was a positive experience for me (a razor blade user) compared to other electric shavers I’ve used in the past. If I have to choose an electric shaver, then Norelco 9300 will be the one. BUT one must consider the cost of this thing. Will people pay $200 plus to buy this? I am not so sure. So the price is what holds me back from giving this product 5 stars.nt your shaver to be fresh and clean, then this system works.

    <li> This shaver delivers as promised.  Gives a very comfortable shave and the cleaning system does the rest.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s review:&lt;br /&gt;I have always used razors, shave oil, shave cream, and shaved in the shower.  Electric razors always seemed to hurt so I stayed away from them.  The Phillips Norelco 9300 Shaver works better than others I&#x27;ve used in the past.  Generally, I dry shave with it but I will occassionally use water without any pulling or snagging.  I use it every couple of days (or less) so the hair is short enough and there is no painful pulling.  It is very light and powerful and I love the feeling (and scent) of always-clean blades.  I would recommend this, for sure!</li>
    <li> This is my first high - end shaver. I got the best price and free shipping which was quick. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I have no issues with this razor. This is replacing a [[ASIN:B006W2SYHQ Philips Norelco 1250X/47 SensoTouch 3D Electric Razor with Jet Clean System (Series 8000)]] that I&#x27;ve been using for the last two years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has the same ergonomic handle. The base/cleaning station has been updated to a smaller form factor that takes up less space on your counter--and it also seems much quieter than my old one. The cutting ability is really good--it&#x27;s the closest thing I&#x27;ve found to actual razor blades. The swivel cutting heads are noticeably effective when cutting around hard-to-cut areas like chins. This displays are nice--I keep it in my gym bag to use at work and it lets me know when I need to take it home and charge it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knowing the quality of shave that you get from this razor, at this price, it&#x27;s definitely worth buying.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a safety razor to shave since I was old enough to do so.  I was curious about electric razors, though, so I decided to give this one a try.  My perspective, then, is really the difference between shaving with a razor and shaving with this Norelco shaver.  Definitely, I don&#x27;t get as close a shave, even at the highest setting (the lowest speed setting didn&#x27;t do anything on me).  Still, I look perfectly presentable, although my face might be a little rougher to the touch.  With a safety razor, I could shave every other day; with this thing, I really have to shave every morning or I get too far behind.  My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to trim around my goatee very well; if I get too close to the &amp;#34;edges&amp;#34;, it starts to pull painfully on the hair of the goatee.  It does ship with a beard trimmer for the edge areas, but that doesn&#x27;t give you a close shave, just a trim, so I end up having to shave around the edges of my beard with a safety razor about once a week anyway.  Still, this electric razor is a LOT faster than my old way of shaving, and it&#x27;s nice having those few minutes back every morning.</li>
    <li> I have tried electric razors in the past but with little success. I have a fairly thick beard (if left unshaved) and always preferred the closeness of a wet razor. However, given the price and claims I figured this product might actually give me the shave I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, let me talk about the positives. It charges very fast and can be used “dry.” It has three different settings depending on the type of beard a guy has. It includes additions for trimming, for guys who might want to trim a mustache, etc. For the high price this is a nice inclusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with its own cleaning system. This seems a bit excessive to me, but with an investment like this, it’s important to take care of it so that it continues to function at the highest level. The instructions for this and everything else are very thorough. It is well-built and “top of the line.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What most impressed me is the closeness of the shave. While it’s not as close as a wet razor, it’s still great, especially for touch ups throughout the day and while on the go. As someone who is very busy, this is a great substitute when I don’t have the time to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only “downside” is the price. It’s very expensive. However, you truly do get what you pay for. If you want a high quality electric razor with a really close shave, this product is for you. With a two year warranty and cleaning system, it will provide you with a lot of value if you let it.</li>
    <li> Philips Norelco S9311/84, 9300 Shaver does all it says it will do in the description on Amazon. I think the only drawback is the price. The biggest difference between it and all the cheaper electric shavers is that it can self-clean. There are different setting but most men will probably be using the slow speed. It does come with a special trimmer which will be great for doing sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does charge very fast. It comes with a 2 year warranty which is amazing. We have a small vanity with one sink so my husband will have to park it in the cabinet below as the stand does take up a lot of room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions are in both Spanish and English. It would be a great idea to review them before shaving. The instructions warn that you might not get as close a shave as you are used to at first and it may irritate your skin at first. But after you have used it for three weeks, “your beard and skin will adjust” then you will have the best shaving experiences. Hopefully those who don’t read the instructions will not throw it away before the three weeks have elapsed. So give it a try for longer than three weeks.&lt;br /&gt;My husband likes the trimmer the best right now because his old one did not have one. He said that the shave was smooth and he was pleased with it. We are counting the weeks to see if the three week promise holds true.</li>
    <li> This is one nice shaver in terms of build quality and shaving performance.  The shaver itself feels solid but is lightweight and easily handled while shaving, with a contour that fits the hand (mine anyway) just right. It is also very quiet; when I press the power button I have to do a double take to make sure it is really working because the whirring of the blades is so quiet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cutting mechanism is very flexible, the three rotating heads all having their own independent &amp;#34;suspension&amp;#34; for a smooth ride over your face.  I have always used electric razors but this is the first time I have tried this configuration so having the three circular blades took some getting used to. It shaves cleanly, at least as well as anything I&#x27;ve used before. The instructions say it takes at least 30 days for my skin/hair to get used to this shaver so we&#x27;ll see how that goes and I can update this review at that time. Right now it works fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The panel on the shaver has the power button as well as a rocker switch to adjust the blade speed. I find that the default medium speed works the best for me but you do have the option of low or high speed as well.  There is also a five-bar power indicator to show when the unit needs recharging.  It seems to hold power very well and recharge time is quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver comes with a massive base.  The reason for the size is to insert a cleaning cartridge in the bottom, which automatically cleans the shaver heads/blades, dries it and recharges it all at the same time.  While a nice feature, I agree with another reviewer who didn&#x27;t like how much valuable counter space this took up.  The replacement cartridges are also relatively expensive, which reminded me of printers: you can buy the printer itself quite cheaply but the ink or toner cartridges cost a lot. In this case, the shaver costs a lot, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daily cleaning is very easy. Just pull off the blades, tap it lightly in the sink to get the hair out,then rinse the shaver motor mechanism and the blade housing.  I like that. No brushes, no mess. And for more thorough cleaning, use the cleaning cartridge. Charging is easy, too. When the shaver is in the holder, you push the top down and it automatically begins charging. Or, you can just plug the electric cord directly into the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also comes with a nice bag for transporting it. The instructions are clearly written and easy to follow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For performance and quality this shaver merits five stars.  I took a star off because of the price (this is one nice shaver but I am not sure it is worth all that extra money) and the bulky base and expensive cleaning cartridges.  If you&#x27;re willing to spend the money, I can imagine this shaver will last a long time and give great shaves.</li>
    <li> I have owned Noreclo electric razors for a number of years, and my previous experiences have all been favorable.  This time, I decided to go a bit “upscale” and purchase a Norelco 9300 series razor.  My experience was mixed, but I have returned the razor as defective and non-functional.  It did not meet my expectations in most ways.  It looks like some engineers had a fun time designing the most complicated (and attractive) shaver and cleaner possible.  I just didn’t find it very functional in actual use.&lt;br /&gt;The PRO’s:&lt;br /&gt;1. The razor itself is stylish in appearance.&lt;br /&gt;2. The shave experience is outstanding.&lt;br /&gt;3. The “cleaning” unit is also quite stylish.&lt;br /&gt;4. The automatic cleaning of the razor is nice, and seems to do a good job.&lt;br /&gt;The CON’s:&lt;br /&gt;1. The cleaning unit is quite large – and is much, much bigger than the razor despite the out of scale sales pictures.  It occupies a *lot* of real estate on the bathroom counter!&lt;br /&gt;2. The cleaning unit must remain plugged in.  The unit is tricky to move as it must remain almost precisely upright otherwise the cleaning solution spills.&lt;br /&gt;3. While the razor is cordless, the cleaning unit is corded.  So, if your desire is to minimize cords in the plugs, this isn’t the unit to use.&lt;br /&gt;4. My unit would intermittently run the cleaning process briefly without being “started” with the start button – even when the razor was not in place on the unit.  Sometimes after the cleaning cycle completed the razor was dry the next day, and sometimes cleaning solution spilled out of the heads even the next day.&lt;br /&gt;5. The razor charges each and every time it is cleaned.  So the 50 minute shaving time battery system is pretty much irrelevant.&lt;br /&gt;6. I found that the on-off button was located at a place on the razor that I kept inadvertently pushing while I was shaving.  The design of the “grip” versus the on-off button of the unit just seems off.&lt;br /&gt;7. You must fully discharge the razor 3 times before the charge level indicator is accurate, according to the instruction manual.  This means you must either not clean the razor using the cleaning unit until the batteries are fully discharged, or you must run the razor for about 50 minutes between cleanings three times.&lt;br /&gt;8. The cleaning solution is basically the razor blade of this electric razor.  It needs to be purchased and replaced regularly.  The manual states that the solution should be changed every 90 days or whenever the unit light indicates the solution should be changed.  In my unit, the light came on after only about a dozen cleanings!  The cleaning solution retails for about $6.00 a refill tank – that translates into about $0.50 per shave!  I returned my unit during the first month – so whether the cleaning solution would have lasted longer or not with subsequent uses is not known.&lt;br /&gt;9. To use the sideburn or mustache trimmer, you must switch heads on the razor unit.&lt;br /&gt;10. To wash the razor manually, you need to remove the heads from the razor body.  There is a small plastic part that holds the heads in place – it looks pretty flimsy to me and like it would not last very long removing and replacing on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;11. All-in-all, this razor was not close to being functional to me in real life.  Save your money with an older, simper design that is much more functional in my experience.&lt;br /&gt;Will start looking a Norelco’s mid-range shavers, and those of other manufactures.</li>
    <li> My husband has tried many electric razors over the years trying to find one that would give a great shave and still not irritate his  sensitive skin. He has been using Gillette Fusion Proglide cartridge razor blades and always has a great shave,  however the cost of the cartridges really adds up over the years.&lt;br /&gt;He is able to shave everyday with this and get a nice smooth shave without irritation.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a blade shaver but I really want to give this shaver every chance in the world, so final review awaits a full 3 weeks of use, I promise, &#x27;cause electric shaver companies always say: \\&quot;Hey, don&#x27;t judge us right away; give us a chance, like 2-3 weeks for your skin to &#x27;adapt&#x27; to our great product\\&quot;. O.K. See actual review at the bottom, as well as excellent comments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I have to post this right now:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Say you go the extra step and get the 9000 series with the \\&quot;Smartclean System\\&quot; and follow the  steps taking up 6.5 pages of the manual. Then, on page 29, you see this, and I quote: \\&quot;Extra thorough cleaning method\\&quot;. WHAT?-- turns out if you want your blade/combs to be extra, thoroughly, really clean, you remove the cutting heads and combs  with the little tool and hold them separately under running water, as per 2 pages of the manual.&lt;br /&gt;So: Rinse heads after every shave \\&quot;for several minutes\\&quot; as per the manual --not gonna happen; maybe ten seconds-- then use the large and lumpy-looking \\&quot;Smart Clean\\&quot; box after every 7th shave  (or 4th, or 10th- or 20th, the manual does not say)... OR skip the whole \\&quot;Smart Clean\\&quot; system and rinse the combs and cutters separately every week or two which takes maybe 3 minutes...  because they want you to do that anyway!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow-up: Just noticed that the manual states that the speedclean solution DOES contain lubricant. Also, Brian R. comments that the cleaning solution in the cartridges will prevent buildup of hard water deposits on the heads. I had not heard of this being a problem, but I live in an area with soft water. Also, Brian R. says if you use soap or shaving cream, the speedclean solution will probably do a better job than just water alone removing scum. That makes sense to me even if it contradicts the \\&quot;more thorough cleaning\\&quot; remark in the manual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 3 weeks of use. Just my impression. I fully admit am an electric shaver dilettante. After reading other reviews I see that some of you guys are long time users of many top models of Panasonic, Braun, Norelco shavers. I still want to see scientific evidence of skin adaptation to electric shaver. I saw NO such effect; shaving did not get closer as time past. I am relieved to be back to a blade (Gillette Fusion) for a real, close shave that lasts all day. Convenience is not there for me. I took the train to work and just don&#x27;t have the chutzpah to use that time shaving. It isn&#x27;t anything near as bad picking your teeth in a restaurant; in fact, it&#x27;s pretty harmless and the shaver is very quiet. Use in a car would be fine; I don&#x27;t think it is anywhere near as distracting as cell phone use and the times when you need to use 2 hands to stretch the skin tight? ... well, that&#x27;s what stoplights are for. Cleaning was easy: flip the top open and hold under running water. The \\&quot;more thorough cleaning\\&quot; in which you extract the individual heads with the included tool is a much slower and more finicky job. The obnoxiously big/ugly speedclean box is certainly easy to use, as long as you don&#x27;t mind the counter top real estate it takes up and the fact that if you tip it over to stow it in a drawer all the fluid in the cartridge will spill out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars for now because the 9000 is shaving pretty darn close, the motor is quiet, torquey, and powerful, and I am getting almost a week out of one charge. As for the whole Smart Clean thing: am I being illogical or missing something? The lubrication maybe? Comments invited, corrections  humbly accepted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Economy: shaver head replacement is called for once a year. At this time the heads are very pricey.  The Smartclean cartridges can be had 2 for $11.99 at Target: very reasonable if you can find them (I couldn&#x27;t).many top models of Panasonic, Braun, Norelco shavers.

The \\&quot;more thorough cleaning\\&quot; in which you extract the individual heads with the included tool is a much slower and more finicky job. The obnoxiously big/ugly speedclean box is certainly easy to use, as long as you don&#x27;t mind the counter top real estate it takes up and the fact that if you tip it over to stow it in a drawer all the fluid in the cartridge will spill out.    4 stars for now because the 9000 is shaving pretty darn close, the motor is quiet, torquey, and powerful, and I am getting almost a week out of one charge. As for the whole Smart Clean thing: am I being illogical or missing something? The lubrication maybe? Comments invited, corrections  humbly accepted.    Economy: shaver head replacement is called for once a year. At this time the heads are very pricey.  The Smartclean cartridges can be had 2 for $11.99 at Target: very reasonable if you can find them (I couldn&#x27;t).</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this shaver as I removed it from the box.  It looks sleek, and has not one but three razors to do one&#x27;s bidding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My initial test was not good. It took over a dozen passes to get a clean shave.. The total time was about 3 minutes.  To be fair I refrained from doing an immediate review since there is always an adjustment period when transitioning to a new shaving method.  My previous method was using a Panasonic single-blade travel razor which I has been in use for about 10 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The review period was 20 days, and I allowed for all 25 days as my adjustment period. During this time I have observed no change in the speed of the shaving. It still took an excessive amount of circular passes to get a close shave.  The shaves did feel better afterwards though, as my skin acclimated to the difference in cutting method. I think for what it does (shave hair), it inflicts way too much damage to the skin than should be necessary.  Just so I&#x27;ve set the right understanding, when I say damage, I mean all electric razors inflict some sort of microabrasion to the skin (thus adjustment periods are needed).  The fact was, this razor inflicted significant abrasion (I can feel it with the aftershave) due to the extended length it of time spent on the skin.  Keep in mind I am very gentle on my skin, letting the razor do its job rather than pressing down excessively the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, the shaver does what it says it does--it gives you a close shave, but not without the extra effort or increased abrasion to your skin. Of course one could argue once your skin as adjusted it doesn&#x27;t matter.  To me it does because that adjustment actually increases the roughness of your face to handle the level of abrasion.  If you like the rough feel, fine.  I like my facial skin to feel baby soft as it naturally is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning mechanism is pretty cool. You just press and it does its thing.  How important is sanitation?  Of course it&#x27;s very important. But my previous razor had no issues in that area either.. Just a quick rinse under hot water and it&#x27;s clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say aside from the slow job it does, the coolest aspect of the razor (the look and high-techness of the dock and cleansing mechanism), seems to be it&#x27;s biggest drawback.  The thing is bright shiny gloss black and picks up hard water stains like an SOB.  It looks pretty gross on the sink. I try my best to keep it dry and clean but being resides in an area that gets wet constantly through hand and face washes, teeth brushing, etc.  It&#x27;s a mess.  It has become an eye sore and keeping it shiny and clean has become a chore, one that I&#x27;d rather not have to do.  I like my Panasonic travel razor. It&#x27;s worked well for me for the last 10 years and I hope for the next.  I was really wanting to try something different but it seems none of this technology has actually improved my experience shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone wants mine, I&#x27;ll be happy to give it to you for free. I won&#x27;t be using it.very important. But my previous razor had no issues in that area either..

    <li> Best shaver I have ever had.</li>
    <li> This shaver works well but I&#x27;m not yet sure if it&#x27;s really an improvement over prior models.</li>
    <li> Not good and comfortable as my old Braun 790CC</li>
    <li> This is my first electronic shaver and I&#x27;m amazed with this one. Smoothly worked on face in both mode ( dry and wet).</li>
    <li> BEST SHAVER I HAVE EVER USED</li>
    <li> I got this electric razor to review through the Amazon vine program.  This is a really great electric razor.  The razor was able to reach all the contours of my face without too much effort.  I have used other electric razors in the past, and they usually struggled in the lower neck near the adams apple. This razor had no issue getting to all the hard to reach places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other issue that I faced with my old razor was that by late afternoon the 5 o’ clock shadow would roll in.  When shaving with a razor, I never had a shadow but I put up with it because the electric razor is so much faster in the morning.  With this Norelco razor, the shadow isn’t really that bad,.  While the shave isn’t as close as with a non-electric razor, it’s much better than other electric razors I have used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my testing I mostly dry shaved, because that is what I have done for years.  I also did try a “wet shave” in the shower with shaving cream and that worked out pretty well.  The end result was that the wet shave felt a little closer, but it wasn’t a huge difference.  The razor worked just fine in the shower; I did try without shaving cream but it worked much better with shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, this razor comes with a cradle for cleaning and drying the head.  After a shave it says in the manual to rinse under water and shake it out before putting it in the cradle.  I don’t use the cradle every day, however it seems to do a pretty good job of cleaning out the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only down side to the cradle is that it is kind of big and uses a proprietary cleaning cartridge (JC302), which I could only find on their site (11.99 for a 2 pack).  The cleaning fluid can spill so you have to be careful not to knock it over, but considering the size of the cradle, that isn’t too much of an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cradle used for cleaning is also something you don’t want to use at night while your trying to fall asleep.  It makes a whirring sound for 15-20 minutes while it cleans that head that isn’t obnoxiously loud but is definitely distracting if you are trying to go to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Overall this is a very nice electric razor.  It gives a nice close shave and the cradle does an excellent job at getting the razor clean and in good working condition.es a whirring sound for 15-20 minutes while it cleans that head that isn’t obnoxiously loud but is definitely distracting if you are trying to go to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Overall this is a very nice electric razor.

    <li> I&#x27;d previously had an old Norelco shaver about 30 years ago, but the batteries finally died and in a weak moment replaced it with a Braun.... the one where the guy advertised it shaved as close as a blade or your money back.  Well that was a lie &amp; I should have returned it but instead threw it in the bottom drawer and went back to shaving with a blade for then next 10 years.  When I saw the new Norelco 9000 series design on TV I decided to get one and try electric shaving again.  What an outstanding shaver. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note well, as the package literature clearly (and correctly) states, if you&#x27;re not accustomed to shaving with an electric razor, you must stick with it and continue using it for every shave for at least 2 to 3 weeks. This is necessary in order to allow your face and beard to adjust.  That may sound silly to some of you, but it is a fact.  If after a week or so you&#x27;re still struggling with it, try using it along with some pre-shave lotion such as &amp;#34;William&#x27;s Lectric Shave&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I love this shaver.  I get a close shave as if I were using a regular razor.</li>
    <li> Used electric shavers all my adult life.  This is the closet shaver.</li>
    <li> Excellent razor, shaves extremely close....best shave I have ever had.  The Smart Clean System has a few problems....Philips sending me a new one to replace the one I got with the razor.</li>
    <li> I have used Philips electric shavers for years but this one is the best. Very close shave but doesn&#x27;t burn.</li>
    <li> Best shaver I ever owned.</li>
    <li> This is a battery operated cordless electric shaver for facial hair. The shaver weighs 4.3 ounces. It is 6 ¼ inches long, 2 ½ wide, and 3 inches deep at its widest points. It runs on a rechargeable lithium battery. Also included in the box are a snap-on side burn trimmer, a transformer/cord that works with either 110 or 220 V input, a zippered hard shell carrying case, a plastic cleaning/recharging station, a plastic cleaning cartridge with cleaning fluid designed to last 3 months, and a 40 page product guide in English. Controls on the handle turn power, speed settings (3 choices), and a travel lock. LED indicators on the handle light up to show the need for cleaning (after every use), travel lock on, battery charge level, replace shaving heads, and blocked shaving heads. A full charge can take as long as an hour, and provides up to 50 minutes of shaving time, or the shaver can be plugged in for just 5 minutes to provide a one-shave quick-charge. The shaver cannot be operated when plugged in. The shaver itself is water resistant so it can be used in the shower, but the cleaner unit must not get wet. The cleaner unit stands 10 inches tall and is 6 inches in diameter, so it takes up a hefty footprint on the counter. To use the cleaning unit, you snap the razor in place and press the on button. Active cleaning takes 10 minutes, followed by a drying cycle of 4 hours. Meanwhile, the razor is also charged while it is being cleaned. Alternatively, you can plug the razor directly into the charger instead of charging it with the cleaning unit, if, for instance, you are travelling and don&#x27;t want to carry the cleaning unit with you. The razor and trimmer can also be cleaned by hand under a tap with running water if the cleaning unit is not available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband is quite impressed with this shaver. It gives a closer, more comfortable shave than his old razor, a Norelco Sensotouch3D, which was also a really good shaver, but this one is even better. The travel case is quite handy, as is the travel lock control. He found that the scent in the cleaning cartridge was somewhat overwhelming, so he won&#x27;t be using the cleaning system until Norelco comes out with an unscented cleaning cartridge. He also finds the LED indicator lights on the handle a bit dim, hard to read unless he is in a dark room. Another possible problem is that the shaving heads and trimmer are separate snap-on pieces on this shaver, so they could get lost more easily than with shavers where these pieces are more permanently attached. Overall, though, the closeness and comfort of the shave with this shaver far outweigh any of these issues. My husband is extremely satisfied with this razor and it has replaced his former favorite, the Sensotouch 3D.is quite handy, as is the travel lock control.

    <li> This the best shaver Norelco has produced. It provides an excellent shave very quickly no matter how long i go between shaves (within reason). The only thing i would identify as a nit is its easy to turn the shaver off in the middle of a shave by m8stake. After a couple of uses you&#x27;ll know how to avoid making that mistake.</li>
    <li> I have to shave many many times to make sure all hairs has properly removed.  Too much waste of my time.</li>
    <li> Husband loves this gift.</li>
    <li> Very nice shaver and good seller. Best shaver I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> As an ROTC cadet, I&#x27;m required to maintain a clean face 24/7. While having previously used a DE razor, the length of each shave(combined with the hassle of the cleanup) had forced me to go looking for a solution. After doing some price searching I&#x27;d settled on this model, and I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m disappointed.  My initial purchase was the Braun 790cc, which had left me severely dissatisfied with it. Since Braun is most often compared with the Phillips series, let me give you some differences in use that I had noticed.  NOISE: The Braun 790cc is EXTREMELY loud( might even be louder than the buzzers they use on hair). The noise was heard through doors, and is definitely not suitable for someone who likes to shave during the late hours of the night. The Phillips, however, is very pleasantly quiet.  IRRITATION: For me, the Braun had given me razor burn nearly every shave. It was a nightmare, and got so bad that I started to fear shaving. The Norelco, however, gives nearly no razor burn due to it&#x27;s design- it will be difficult to use circular motions if you&#x27;re pushing too hard, thus keeping the user from giving themselves any razor burn. I was very pleased.  BUILD: The Norelco is very light and feels a bit flimsy, so the Braun wins this by a landslide.  UTILITY: While the Braun may feel good in your hand, only the severely expensive models allow wet and dry shaving. This Norelco model also allows both, and at a much lower price.  CLEANING: I was a bit lost with how to clean the Braun, and as such needed the cleaning station more often. This can add fairly high costs due to Braun&#x27;s alcohol based cleaning solution evaporating. The Norelco station is of a MUCH worse design and doesn&#x27;t perform as well, but the fluid lasts longer and is alcohol free. In addition, cleaning the Norelco by hand is very easy, and the entire unit is waterproof.  SHAVE QUALITY: Both razors did not give as close a shave as a blade, and this is expected. However, the Braun missed a lot of the hairs on myneck. The Norelco rarely misses hairs. In addition, if oil or shaving fluid is used to aid the razor, a very smooth shave can be obtained. The downside is that the shave doesn&#x27;t last very long(electric razors don&#x27;t shave off skin, and this decreases hair growth time), so you may need to shave every day to maintain that &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; appearance.  Overall, I highly suggest this razor. My schedule requires me to look good and do it quickly, and this unit does the task. However, do note that your experience may vary, so it is a good idea to try several different razors if you aren&#x27;t totally satisfied.  EDIT: It&#x27;s been about 5 months or so since I&#x27;ve used this razor. I still enjoy it, though have a few more thoughts from the extended use:  The ability to shave in the shower is amazing. Through doing this, I can obtain the closest shave possible with this razor while avoiding razor burn. I literally let the water run right on my face as a shave, and the shaver has no issues with this.  The cleaning station is a bit of a joke. Although is does seem to be removing some additional hair, it takes a very long time to dry. I usually just clean the head in the sink, and run it through the station once a week or so just to keep it &amp;#34;top-notch&amp;#34;.  The cleaning fluid lasts a loooong time! Though I don&#x27;t use it frequently(see above), I still have around 75%+ of the cleaning solution from the cartridge that came with the shaver. This is great, considering I&#x27;d lost a good amount from moving to and from my dorm. At this rate I expect only having to use 1-2 per year.  The razor is better for those who shave daily/frequently. As my shaving requirements were lifted for the summer, I&#x27;d begun shaving less frequently. This resulted in worse results and more razor burn from the shaver.</li>
    <li> The shaver is excellent.  I really liked the cleaning, drying and charging cradle until it stopped working after the fifth week.  Norelco is sending a replacement.</li>
    <li> Shiny skin and cleaner feelin&#x27;. The Norelco Philips 9300 keeps me shavin for healthier and fairer skin complexion....</li>
    <li> Not crazy about this.  Noisy.  Sounds cheap.  shaves OK.  I went back to my razor.  I would rather get a close shave and perhaps bleed to death.</li>
    <li> Great shaver.  I bought this one after my 10 year-old top-of-the-line foil shaver bit the dust. I had also become tired of hearing its loud buzz so close to my ears, so decided to give this one a try, but wondered if a rotary could approach the foil&#x27;s closeness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First thing I noticed was, this shaver is SO Q-U-I-E-T. This is worth the price of admission, and much better than the new foils I looked at!  Second thing, even though Philips advises a month to adjust to a new shaver design, this shaves nicely (although probably not as well as a good foil), and it also gets hair along curved areas on the neck much better than the foil (which never did that very well). I am a clinical worker and cannot take a chance of bleeding from a razor, and this item fits the bill. The shaver can charge on a cord or the station, and can be cleaned with warm water. I also thought the cleaning station, although bulky and full of curious buzzes and whirrs, worked quite well for occasional disinfection (although I&#x27;d suggest Philips investigate a simple drying cycle for people who just want to use water to clean the shaver). I could not compare it with a modern foil aside from the noise, but it does a good job of shaving, especially when used wet.  I also have a smaller portable Norelco to take to work, and that one shaves so well, I don&#x27;t think you need all the (expensive) multiple angles and floating heads of the more expensive models, but the disinfection stand is worth considering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are new to a rotary I would suggest some of the three or four minute You Tube videos to help you get the most from the shaver, since it does take a slightly different technique than a razor or a foil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawbacks? The pouch is too small to carry the charging cord and trimmer along with the shaver, and seems too soft to cushion the delicate-looking heads during heavy travel packing (the shaver will probably go into a tupperware container on long trips). You have to carry a separate trimmer for the sideburns, and replacement heads are not cheap. It looks more delicate than my foil, but that just means you have to be careful. That&#x27;s about it, and they are minor drawbacks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, a nice, quiet, efficient shaver.separate trimmer for the sideburns, and replacement heads are not cheap.

    <li> Exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> Good working shaver. Does what it is supposed to do. Cleaning works very well too.</li>
    <li> While the shaver is relatively a good shaver... and does a good job.  Takes longer to shave than cartridge straight razors.  After the skin break in period the shave feels smoother than with straight razors... Straight razors leave a &#x27;sharp&#x27; cut on each hair.  This feels like each hair has a bit more &#x27;round&#x27; .. and therefore smother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Smart clean unit... I give a 0 or a 1.  The electronics are erratic, and unreliable.  Several times, the unit was stuck in the 10 minute clean cycle for all night long.  Which of course will certainly degrade ALL of the equipment. Squirt liquid.. spin blades, squirt liquid spin blades.  The cleaning unit does not seem to be thoroughly engineered/tested.</li>
    <li> Great product.  This is my third one and they keep getting better.</li>
    <li> Disappointed. My old shaver does better job than this one.</li>
    <li> Ok the shaver works fine but not sure who they have in the engineering department for the design. The large shaving heads work about as fast as my old 8885XL but that one I could hold onto. The handle on this thing is better shaped for someone with very small hands. Too thin and smooth and you eventually wind up accidentally pressing the power button frequently because that is the best place to hold while shaving. I could do without the giant black cleaning tub on my sink, and preferred the older style head with a hinge that I could easily flip open to tap the shaving head for cleaning. This one requires popping the entire head off which I know will lead to some piece of plastic breaking off before long. I don&#x27;t think this larger shaving head does any better than my older model but I plan to return it just because the handle design makes it irritating to use.</li>
