    <li> I am so in love with this!  I have been using it for almost a month &amp; have noticed a huge difference in my skin!  It has become more smooth &amp; my trouble spots are just about gone!  Definitely something I will be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> This serum is non-irritating; clears and calms my skin.  I use it on my entire face,  This is a must to have when to travel.  I make sure I have this all the time.</li>
    <li> received for discounted price for my review&lt;br /&gt;skin looks great and feels baby soft</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom as she always complains the dryness of her skin.  She used it for a couple of days, and she has already felt the difference, her skin is more moist now, and she does not feel burn feeling caused by the dryness anymore.  recommend~</li>
    <li> A gift for my daughter, she really like it.</li>
    <li> very nice product will buy again!</li>
    <li> this product makes your skin silky smooth and i noticed my dark spots were disappearing. Best Vitamin C serum out there</li>
    <li> The company is support is great. I had trouble with the pump not working on the containing. They listened to my problem and immediately resolved all issues.&lt;br /&gt;As for the product so far very nice. I normally do not rate a product until I have used it at least 30 days. So far very good. I had to respond to the service which was excellant.</li>
    <li> Honestly I haven&#x27;t used it consistently enough to say whether it&#x27;s a  good or bad product. Right now I feel comfortable saying it&#x27;s okay until further usage. I plan on using it more often than I can amend this review.</li>
    <li> Works great with being greasy.  Feels good on skin.  Happy with this.</li>
    <li> Vitamin C Serum is a &amp;#34;holy grail&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; product that everyone should be including in their skincare routines!  If you think just taking a Vitamin C supplement orally has you covered, think again!  Applying Vitamin C Topically is 20 times more effective than taking it orally!&lt;br /&gt;Most recently I have been testing out this one that Swiss Botany sent me to review and I have been loving it!  I have been applying the Swiss Botany Vitamin C Serum twice a day in my morning and evening skincare routines and it has helped reduce the appearance of my fine lines, helped brighten my skin and it also feels more soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;This Vitamin C Serum has a potent blend of Vitamins C, E &amp; A  that help improve skin&#x27;s clarity and boost collagen production it&#x27;s also very gentle and free of Parabens and best of all it&#x27;s super effective!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product complimentary in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Vitamin C Serum for a few weeks now and I just love it.  It applies smoothly &amp; easily and then absorbs very quickly.  It makes my skin feel so soft. I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Vitamin C serum helps support skin health by boosting collagen production. Vitamin C serum is a natural skin care ingredient that is often found in high-end beauty regimes, and Vitamin C serums, creams and lotions are popping up everywhere.Vitamin C is helpful for brightening and tightening skin.</li>
    <li> It smells bad. Like stale beer almost. I couldn&#x27;t get over that, as the scent lingers.&lt;br /&gt;I use it on the backs of my hands and it has improved the youthful look of my hands. I wish it didn&#x27;t stink so I could tolerate it on my face lol!&lt;br /&gt;Also,  the label was very sticky..and felt tacky to the touch.. like double sided tape. It had to be removed as fuzz and lint kept sticking to it</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth seems to tighten</li>
    <li> Love Vitamin C!  So great !!!</li>
    <li> I just received this serum this week and have been applying it each day. It immediately made my face feel smoother and diminish fine lines. I am very happy with it!</li>
    <li> I have nothing but praises for this product. I usually apply it daily after my evening bath and it feels sooo good on my skin. I&#x27;ve also been getting complements that I&#x27;ve been glowing, so maybe it does work! But I really haven&#x27;t had a skin care routine before this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with this product and would repurchase in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> A wonderful Vitamin C Cream Moisturizer 20% For Face Anti-Aging Beauty Cream! Your face will look better than ever before. Such great ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin C helps the body produce collagen, a structural protein that helps form bone, tendons and ligaments. Several types of collagen provide structure for body tissues, but type I and type III collagen have the greatest effect on the skin, according to SmartSkinCare.com. Type III collagen makes the skin of young people very soft. As people age, type I collagen replaces type III collagen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin E also serves as an antioxidant in the human body. Vitamin C may play a role in regenerating oxidized vitamin E, which is vitamin E that interacts with free radicals to prevent cell damage. Vitamin E has several important functions related to the skin. It protects the skin from UV light and, may improve the texture of skin and reduce the depth of skin wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> LIke consistency and does seem to be working.</li>
    <li> i love the smell. it is good for skin. it feels good. i put it on face during night, then in the morning I feels good.</li>
    <li> great product, great results love it.</li>
    <li> Shipping was very fast and impressed with the packaging.  Made my skin feel so soft and supple. Just need a little bit. I liked the slight citrus scent, it drys slightly sticky but I used under a moisturizer.  I am very pleased with this product</li>
    <li> it left my face nice and soft</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel great, has a nice scent, absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy, greasy film.</li>
    <li> Prior to leaving my review, I would like to point out that I received this product at a significant discount as a promotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so I have had this for a few weeks now and I cannot say that I use it religiously, but I have used it a few times. From what I have noticed, it has a very citrusy smell. It&#x27;s not necessarily a bad smell, but I guess I wasn&#x27;t expecting it. So far, it makes my face feel soft and I am overall content with the way the product works. Ideally, I will update this review in a few months after having used this product for a longer period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I am not so fond of is the texture of the product. As another reviewer has mentioned, it is rather sticky. I can get past that (since the overall benefits would outweigh the inconvenience of it being sticky), but it certainly not enjoyable to deal with.</li>
    <li> After applying this product I could see a improved tone in my skin and a bit of a glow, while these are great it&#x27;s not to moisturizing at least not in my skin, condition as a dry skin type, I&#x27;ve used it for 2 weeks straight and it has really picked up my complexions evenness . Two thumbs up !&lt;br /&gt;Add on, after 1 1/2 month now of using this product my complexion has really just has improved dramatically and so has my confidence. Never had anything work for me like this before</li>
    <li> Swiss Botany has created a great Vitamin C serum. I have used their products in the past and have always been pleased. They are quality products and come with a no hassle guarantee. As you use this serum, you will notice fine lines and that crepey look going away. I am very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I like it but don&#x27;t love it. It does work in firming and feels great the day after (been using for a week or so now) but this stuff is STICKY and leaves like a weird tight skin feeling that&#x27;s not natural or good-looking. Looks like you had plastic botox on your face... so wouldn&#x27;t do this before leaving for the day, use it nightly instead.</li>
    <li> I like this product. The sun has damaged my skin so badly, this has seemed to even out the color of my skin tone, and seems to be taking the redness away too.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with Swiss Botany products. They tighten your skin, make it glow and you see quick results!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Immediately saw eye wrinkles disappear and my face looks and feels so soft!!!</li>
    <li> When I woke up from a hard night of crying and stress from the loss of a loved one, my eyes had huge bags under them. I put this on and a second later looked in the mirror and the bags were gone. It is hard to amaze me but I was truly amazed. It leaves my face so soft.</li>
    <li> This serum is really sticky and doesn&#x27;t absorb very well</li>
    <li> Love the scent of this product. It&#x27;s a great make up primer as well. My foundation goes on smoother and stays more fresh looking for longer. I don&#x27;t have any lines or wrinkles yet, so hopefully this product will keep it that way!!!</li>
    <li> Makes my face so soft and smooth will buy again.</li>
    <li> I am posting this review for my wife since we only have one Amazon account.&lt;br /&gt;This makes my face feel so nice. I really am impressed with what this does for me. My face feels clean and smooth and my fine lines are slowly diminishing. I have to admit that I was skeptical but I wanted to give this a try and now I am glad I did. I can recommend this Vitamin C serum to all my friends. I am 44 years old and I am here to tell you that this works.</li>
    <li> This product fit my needs perfectly.  I could not be more happy with this product because it does exactly what they said it would do.  I use it every morning and highly recommend it to anyone who wants to look younger.</li>
    <li> I have used a few brands of vitamin C serum, and this brand is the best for me so far. The results are instant, am still using it and I love the way my skin feels (silky smooth) and look. Will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> This vitamin C serum has made my complexion radiant and supple. My aging skin is soft and silky. My skins youthful qualities have been restored. Even my husband asked what I had done differently to my face. It is also the perfect base for makeup. Makes it glide on so smoothly. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product. It takes only a few drops too and my skin feels soft and supple all day.I have recommended this to all my friends. I wish I had discovered this a long time ago. I will be using it every day from now on.</li>
    <li> Great item! Highly recommend! Smells great as well.</li>
    <li> Like the title says amazing!</li>
    <li> I love the way this makes my skin feel.  It is so gentle.  I have sensitive skin and I was so happy to fine something this doesn&#x27;t make my skin irritated.</li>
    <li> Skin is healthier, and younger looking. LOVE this product. Not oily or dry near perfect skin!</li>
    <li> Seems like a quality product, makes my skin very soft, it has a silky, but not greasy texture, and smells good too! Certain products make my skin break out, but no break outs with this! I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Great product. I love the texture, absorbs to my skin so quickly.</li>
    <li> No complaints so far.  Feels nice on the skin.  As of now I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my vitamin c serum . I received it when they said I would  and it  is what it was pictured to be. Although I haven&#x27;t used it as I should have I believe it  will  do what I need it to.</li>
    <li> Loving this serum.  I can see a brightness in my skin and some age spots lightened.  Will DEFINITELY order this again!  Don&#x27;t be fooled by spending hundreds of dollars at your beauty counter when this item actually WORKS!  I&#x27;ve tried everything....from expensive items at the Beauty Counters to ordering products on-line (QVC) and nothing has worked as well as this!</li>
    <li> Great product........I found my skin improved dramatically just after a few applications.  I use it at night on a clean face.....goes on so smooth and skin feels like a baby.  Use it judiciously as a drop goes a long way.  It is going to be my go-to for a long time because my face and skin glows.</li>
    <li> No noticeable difference.</li>
    <li> I really like this serum.It absorbs well in to my skin and makes it feel silky smooth!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I&#x27;m obsessed with anti aging products but this is one of my favorites. It absorbs well into the skin. Doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling. A little goes a long way. I have definately noticed the area around my eyes where my wrinkle and crows feet were. While they are not completely gone, they for sure have diminished some. I see where another review said something about a bad smell, but that isn&#x27;t the case with mine. There is no bad smell with the one I got. Give it a try, you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> Does not work. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> The product receives 1 star from me, but the company receives 5 stars, hence the 3 stars. The product may work, but it is so sticky that I will not use it. I ordered it twice since I thought maybe the first one I received was a bad batch. Other products I have tried from the company (e.g., vitamin C eye gel, apple stem cell) absorb quickly and do not leave any residue. This one definitely does. I couldn&#x27;t wait to wash it off. I was offered a refund since it does not suit my skin, so no loss for trying it.</li>
    <li> I la la la love this product! I use it right before I put my make up on and have noticed a tremendous difference on my skin. My skin has gotten smoother and my scars have faded. I&#x27;ll definitely repurchase!</li>
