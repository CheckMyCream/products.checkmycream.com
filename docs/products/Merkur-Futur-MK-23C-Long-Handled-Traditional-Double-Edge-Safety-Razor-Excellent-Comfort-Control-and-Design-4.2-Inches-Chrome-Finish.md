<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very nice saves me money.  I got this to replace a butterfly style that failed very solid saves money works great</li>
    <li> This razor is great, my husband uses it regularly to shave his face and head. So much better than all of the 5+ blade options out there, cheaper too!</li>
    <li> Went Retro wish I had before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this razor with the Personna blades.</li>
    <li> I need to buy another one, just to have a spare.</li>
    <li> Shaving with one of these feels so much classier than with a disposable, a tri-razored beast, or an electric, all of which I&#x27;ve dealt with in the past.  This safety razor has gravitas, and is much cheaper to shave with in the long run.  I switch out a cheap little razor blade maybe once every two months, shaving 2-4 times a week.</li>
    <li> The razor does not work properly.</li>
    <li> Love this razor way better then those fancy plastic one.</li>
    <li> Why didn&#x27;t I know about these earlier instead of wasting my time and money with the razors you see advertised on TV!!</li>
    <li> Bought one years ago, worked fine actually way cleaner shave than disposable razors, this purchase was for a family member. Ended up buying 100 pack of razor blades for both of us. Better smoother cut, fraction of the price of those mainstream razors. One of my best buys on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is such a great razor.  I&#x27;ve read that the finish is not impressive, but I disagree.  Every edge and surface are beautifully smooth and polished.  I&#x27;ve used it with about 8 or 10 different blade brands, and they all work fine in this razor.  I can&#x27;t imagine not having the &amp;#34;long&amp;#34; handle.  It is not long.  It is what I would consider is a minimum length for a razor.</li>
    <li> good razor, but it doesn&#x27;t open the way my dads did.</li>
    <li> So I decided to make the switch from cartridge razors to DE, for both economical reasons and to reduce ingrown hairs. After having used it for a month, I&#x27;m definitely noticing less ingrown hairs. I cut myself the first few times using it, nothing to bad but it just takes some getting used to, once you get it down though it makes for a lot more enjoyable shave. Also I bought a 50 pack of feather razors for $20, at this rate those razors will last me an entire year compared to the $20 for 4 cartridge razors that might last me a month if im lucky.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband who was looking for an old fashioned straight razor. I thought this would be good since it is a little safer while getting use to using a straight blade. It has a nice weight to it and fits his hands nicely, which are on the large size. The replaceable blades normally last him about a month, since you are able to used both sides.</li>
    <li> I use it every other day</li>
    <li> I wish i had purchased this sooner! Always used the 4 blade razor. was sick and tired of paying so much so i took a chance on these. Did a little research and from what i read these safety razors were good. I just didn&#x27;t expect them to be this good. This Merkur razor is a perfect size. Has a good weight to it. It honestly makes shaving enjoyable. I can&#x27;t believe how smooth my shave is. And razor bumps are COMPLETELY gone! You are truly missing out if you don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
    <li> I have been wet shaving for a very short period and am completely happy with this razor! I was terribly nervous using it after shaving with a Mach 3 the past 17 years. I spent so many hours re-reading and re-watching how-to guides! It has been super easy for me to adapt to and I have only had a few nicks in my neck area, very minor and no pain.  I can&#x27;t recommend this enough for beginners, and get a blade sampler pack so you can find the best DE razor for your skin!</li>
    <li> So I have been looking into how to save money and the ridiculously overpriced cartridge razor market and after trying off brand and even the Dollar Razor Club I figured I&#x27;d give this a try.  With blades priced at .50 a blade I figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the Gillette Fusion Pro Glide for ever and just grew tired of the price I was paying 18.00 for only 4 cartridge blades especially when I regularly got ingrown hairs and irritated skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Dollar Shave club actually has very comparable blades for half the price but that still put me at 2.25 per blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I finally decided to give this &amp;#34;wet shaving&amp;#34; a try and after reading many reviews on many different sites I decided to go with this long handled Merkur do to my larger hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This RAZOR IS AMAZING! !!!! I can not believe the ease of use and how amazing the shave is.  No irritation and it is by far the closest shave you will ever have.  BUY THIS RAZOR TODAY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor combined with a good soap like Mitchells wool fat will make you shave slick as ice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch the Mantic 59 videos on YouTube before you shave with a DE razor for the first time.  He gives great tips and made my first shave with one extremely easy and problem free.</li>
    <li> Over two years of use, I will never use anything different.  If you are new to old school shaving, this is totally different then regular disposable.  There is a form to this style of shaving and comes with little practice and feel. I get great lasting shaves, for super cheap, one blade lasts me three weeks of every other day of shaving. Can&#x27;t beat this value and quality, I look forward to a warm shave and using my razor.  I will teach my son this and get him one when he is ready.</li>
    <li> Been using it for about a year. Never cut myself. It&#x27;s my first safety razor. Easy to learn, just go slow. Never used any other so can&#x27;t compare to any others, but if I can use it, then you can to. I do still use a Gillete Mach 3 for more difficult areas (adam&#x27;s apple etc.), I can&#x27;t seem to get this safety razor to always work in those funky areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
    <li> THIS RAZOR IS GREAT, REALLY GOOD SMOOTH SHAVES. THERE NOTHING LIKE A DOUBLE EDGE SAFETY RAGOR !  FAST SHIPPING.  THANK YOU.  RICK</li>
    <li> Love this razor.  Simple. Sturdy.  Works. If your looking to buy a great start razor this is it.  No flash or hype.  Just a sturdy, high quality razor with a nice safety feature.</li>
    <li> inexpensive and well made. the checkered grip gives perfect gripping surface while the weight leaves a good heft in the hand. i&#x27;d buy another but this will likely out last me, so whats the point in having two?</li>
    <li> I thought old safety razors were a thing of the past and modern technology had rendered them obsolete. I was wrong. I believed the advertising that said more razors on the head meant a closer shave with less irritation. I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been searching high and low for a cheaper alternative to the rip off cartridge razors and I found several sites dedicated to wet shaving. I figured the people who did that were just enthusiasts with a stake in their hobby so they couldn&#x27;t give objective advice on the subject. I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My jaw line and neck used to burn and itch for a full 24 hours after a shave. I figured that was just my lot in life. I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took the plunge and bought this razor with [[ASIN:B001QY8QXM 100 Astra Superior Premium Platinum Double Edge Safety Razor Blades]] and now when I shave, it doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m shaving! I get a close shave and with only a splash of some cheap generic witch hazel afterwards my razor rash is gone for good and for a very modest up front investment, I&#x27;m set for the next two years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe I was getting suckered into buying an inferior product for so much more money. I threw those expensive cartridge razors in the trash and this time, I wasn&#x27;t wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What was a chore is now a pleasure. This is the only way to shave.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like it. It&#x27;s difficult to get a clean shave with. I wish I had not purchased it.</li>
    <li> This safety razor is an excellent alternative the popular cartridge razors. I finally made the switch at the recommendation of a friend after complaining to him about my chronic razor burn and ingrown hairs. The technique is different, but after just two weeks I noticed a huge difference in my skin, and actually enjoy shaving. This product made the switch super easy.</li>
    <li> Love this razor it&#x27;s easy to use and simple, much cheaper than a disposable and does a better job. My only complain is the way the blade gets changed - you unscrew the head and take it apart, I haven&#x27;t cut my self yet but I will; and it&#x27;s made it into the toilet bowl twice already :)</li>
    <li> Great &#x27;old school&amp;#34; shaving razor. I would not change it for anything. It is a quality piece.</li>
    <li> Bought to get a nice clean shave after reading a suggestion by a Detroit barber in Style magazine.  When I saw how much less the blades/refills are compared to other brands, it&#x27;s AMAZING!  My hubby stole it, Luvs it, I&#x27;ve yet to get it out of his hands!</li>
    <li> This is my first safety razor and I like it quite a bit. It&#x27;s heavier than you think if you&#x27;re used to the Mach 3 or any other comparable disposable. With that being said, I found it easy to adapt to after a few shaves and am getting better and faster after about 30 shaves now. It&#x27;s well made and if you take care of it, it will probably last many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also as a side note, I&#x27;m trying to use up the last of my old shaving cream &amp;#34;Every Man Jack&amp;#34; and it is still working well. Not as well as if you use it with the recommended creams but it works.</li>
    <li> Want a great shave? Don&#x27;t look any further. The Merkur long handle with a good blade like Personna or Wilkinson Sword is all you&#x27;ll ever need.</li>
    <li> I had my doubts about this razor based on a few reviews stating that the screw thread broke off. I&#x27;ve had this for about 3 months and think that this product deserves 5 stars. It does what it has to do and doesn&#x27;t feel cheap</li>
    <li> Awesome product. I would highly recommend. It takes getting used to shaving with a safety razor, but it is totally worth it. I wished that I started using this years ago and saved myself hundreds of dollars wasted on disposable razors.</li>
    <li> Merkur long handle shaves great. The guard is nice. Feels very good and comfortable in my hand. Get very close shave. I recommend.</li>
    <li> Still great after a year of use. Hoping to keep this maintained for many years.</li>
    <li> Fits my hand a shaves great.  Could have been a tad heavier , but gives the best shave I&#x27;ve had in years.</li>
    <li> I have used this for a while now, and it is a great razor that is straightforward and very good. I would purchase a Merkur razor again.</li>
    <li> This razor Its just amazing, no more ingrown hairs, bumps cuts, etc.. I would totally recommend</li>
    <li> So much cheaper than using a cartridge razor.</li>
    <li> Glad I made the switch from Fusion</li>
    <li> Well made as one would expect from Merkur. Not has hefty as the shorter razors, but there are times where I want the longer handle for better control and this fits the bill at a good price.</li>
    <li> With the cost of razor blades these days I set out to find a less expensive option. This is it! It was so smooth that I had to check to make sure I had a blade in it! My face always gets sore until this one. I bought another one to give to my brother as a birthday gift.</li>
    <li> The Merkur Model 180 safety razor handles nicely. The handle grip is just right especially when using it in the shower. The design is nice and functional. I would recommend this to someone.</li>
    <li> Shipped in a box labeled for another razor but contained the right Merkur razor. Razor head screws off to add blades.  I would have preferred on that just opens up.</li>
    <li> I have gone through many different razors, disposable, Gillette...etc. Since i&#x27;ve started using this one I haven&#x27;t gotten a single ingrown hair or irritation. It works great. The only thing about it is you may have to go over the same spot a couple times to get a close shave but it still doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. It takes a little practice to get used to it. I would buy this again and again!!</li>
    <li> Was hoping this would work after reading all the great reviews but it turns out I&#x27;m Not satisfied. Barely shaves my face and doesn&#x27;t cut very well. Will be returning.</li>
    <li> My fiancé loves it, claims he is going to pass it down to his future son someday.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find a stand that&#x27;s tall enough and that it balances well on.</li>
    <li> Like many others I got tired of shelling out $$$ for extra blade heads so I opted for this razor instead. The reviews spoke for themselves and I have to agree this is a great alternative. It&#x27;s a compact safety razor that has weight to it so little pressure is usually needed to shave. The blades switch out pretty easily by twisting the handle and the head and blades are double edged so you can use both sides. It&#x27;s all pretty straight forward. There&#x27;s really nothing to complain about with this razor and I would recommend it to those who can exercise some caution since it can potentially give you a good cut if used carelessly.</li>
    <li> Bought this razor for my boyfriend for our anniversary and he liked it. He always bought the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; model Gillette and was able to use this razor with no problem. I personally believe this razor is better than the mainstream razors seeing that the blades really do not cost all that much.</li>
    <li> I really like this razor.  It is heavyweight and very comfortable to use.  The long handle is excellent.  I am 6&#x27; 8&amp;#34; tall and this fits my hand perfectly.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend who was wanting to buy a fancy gillette razor or the such but the price for the replacement was insane. So I decided to get back to basics and bought him this. It arrived fast like the very next day after I ordered it. I couldn&#x27;t believe it. It was looking great and the boyfriend told me this morning it was the closest shave he&#x27;s ever had. No razor burn. I can&#x27;t wait to touch his face tonight. I figure this is a fantastic investment.</li>
    <li> Works great and is good quality</li>
    <li> After using this twice I am sure the multiple blade razors are a gimmick. Comfortable shave with less irradiation, way cheaper and looks cool.</li>
    <li> I bought this years ago and have never looked back to disposable razors again. I got an Astra 100 pack of blades and have barely gotten through 20 of them. At 10 cents a piece I&#x27;ve spent only 2 dollars in razors in a couple years, and this high quality razor will definitely last a lifetime. I definitely prefer the long handle as opposed to the short handle. Beautiful product, great to use, easy to maintain, love it! Even got one for my dad.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my husband and he loves it. Gets a closer shave that lasts longer and is smoother.</li>
    <li> Nice quality and worth the price.  Product is made in Germany and of good craftsmanship.  This is a nice addition to any shaving set.</li>
    <li> For the price it is excellent. It clam shells the blades perfectly and it keeps them secure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only down side is that the top doesn&#x27;t butterfly open like i expected it to, it spins off like a bottle top. I&#x27;m not going to give it a 4 out of 5 because of my own unknowing, If you don&#x27;t have stable hands this is not for you</li>
    <li> Best shaver I have had!</li>
    <li> great razor works well.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using this type of razor to shave with. I&#x27;ve been using cartridge type razors for seemingly forever, while recently using the VERY expensive Gillette Fusion Pro Glide. Hands down the Merkur 180 Safety Razor beats it. The shave was very close and smooth without any razor burn. I had 1 tiny nick that bled very little, but this was my first time using the razor. I always had more, especially the mustache area, from all other cartridge razors. This one nick was actually on the chin area. Cost wise, this one crushes the cartridge razors as well. Get yourself a bulk pack of 30-50 razors for far far less than the cartridges and your set. Invest in some shaving oil and alcohol/glycol free lotion along with alcohol free after shave as well for the very best shave!</li>
    <li> I guess I&#x27;ll make this quick.  I&#x27;m 45 years old, I learned to shave with a DE razor when I was 13 or so.  I&#x27;ve read so many reviews talking about technique and angles, it&#x27;s all bull. I don&#x27;t care if you&#x27;re new to shaving or used a straight-razor all your life.  This is called a &#x27;Safety&#x27; razor for a reason. It&#x27;s pretty damn safe.  This Merkur also has a nice heft to it and any blade you can buy for it will be better than a Mach 3.  Folks, don&#x27;t be scared of this, you won&#x27;t cut your jugular vein and if you get a nick, hell...put some paper on it and it&#x27;ll be gone in 10 mins.  This is a great razor.</li>
    <li> This is the only safety razor I&#x27;ve used, so all i can say is that it&#x27;s a great razor.  switching to a safety razor from the Venus drugstore was the best thing i&#x27;ve done for my legs.</li>
    <li> I bought a variety pack of 15 different types of blades and they all sucked when used with this razor.  It wasn&#x27;t because of poor technique or blade quality but basically that this razor is terrible.  Ended up buying an electric Panasonic shaver and it has been the best.  This razor doesn&#x27;t shave close enough unless you go against the grain which doesn&#x27;t cut any hairs but basically pulls every one out of your face.  Wish I returned it but now it just sits in the drawer and probably never used again.</li>
    <li> This is my first DE razor so I am reserving a 5 star review just in case I find a better one. Very pleased with this Merkur long handled razor however. I have large hands and this is easy to maneuver especially for a new, awkward convert to wet shaving. (I also tried a EJ DE89 and it is much heavier with a shorter, slick-chrome handle. It slipped out of my hand and I got a nice bloody nick on my lower nostril.)  User error of course but I like the weight and feel of this blade&#x27;s construction. The outside ragged chrome also makes it grip to your finger tips. It looks sleek as well and the razor&#x27;s apparatus is easy to adjust and rinse after shave. (A little less so with the  clunky EJ89 razor which I will use warily now until we make friends.) Enjoy and happy shaving!</li>
    <li> The Merkur Model 180 is a great razor. I have been shaving with a Gillette butterfly open double edge razor for almost 20 years. I bought the Merkur razor because I wanted to have a longer handle, but I was concerned that it was not a butterfly open style. I found that after using this razor, the screw together head was much better. First, the head is much smaller which allows for more precision shaving. In addition, the head is made of solid pieces of metal (the butterfly top has thin metal to allow it to open), which holds the heat of the hot water. The hot razor head feel great on the face.</li>
    <li> The razor is great.  Got a nice clean shave.  I&#x27;d recomend it to any guy who&#x27;s lookin for a life time of clean shaves.</li>
    <li> Get a nice shave buy this razor is not going to last long. It has done started pitting on inside of head ant looks like is rusting around blade alinement pins. And I have only had this for about a month. Just not as good a quality as a edwin jagger de 89lbl. I like the handel of the merkur so I now use it on the edwin jagger seems to be a perfect marriage of the two . Edwin jagger needs to make a 4 inch handel with good knurling on it and it woud be the perfect razor..</li>
    <li> This razor has good weight, making a smooth shave very easy, just let the blade and the weight o fthe razor do the work. Very nice finish. Very happy with the product</li>
    <li> Great length. Only issue I had with it is where the head unscrews is not the same as the smaller version. Makes things a little more delicate when you&#x27;re swapping out blades or opening it up a bit to clean out. The weight is quite nice too. Solid razor.</li>
    <li> Quite possible the smoothest shave I have ever had, I didn&#x27;t feel like I had to work hard or tug, and the razor glided smoothly through the stubble I had been growing since the day before. Afterwards, very little to no razor burn. Not as fast as my Gillette Fusion ProGlide, but the shave was significantly better and more enjoyable without requiring the technical finesse of my Dovo 5/8\\&quot; Straight Razor. All in all, I would highly recommend a Merkur 180 Long Hand Safety Razor to anyone and everyone. The best part is the blades are 10 for a dollar fifty.</li>
    <li> Make sure you have the bottom piece attached correctly, after taking it off to put in a razor. The groves should be facing UP and not down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did this one day by mistake and the razor would barely take off hair due to the blade being blocked. I have a feeling this is the problem on the negative reviews left about this razor not cutting hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made the switch from disposables and have been pleased. This razor is made well and does a great job shaving. Plus its saves a lot of money. Can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
    <li> I would recommend this if you have sensitive skin and you want a closer shave than the one you would get with a cartridge razor.</li>
    <li> i wish it were heavier.  I have an Edwin Jagger DE89 and that is an awesome razor this one just does not have the weight that is my personal liking.  It seems to miss whiskers and such...great travel or backup in case your favorite razor breaks or disappears&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;however would not recommend or buy again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking around for a safety razor and decided to give this one a try. I love it. works great and I think I might get one for my buddy as well. You can&#x27;t really beat the price too.</li>
    <li> I could not be happier with this razor. Very sturdy, good weight, good materials. Would buy again if I ever lost mine.</li>
    <li> Very good balance and weight.&lt;br /&gt;Love the long handle.&lt;br /&gt;Does a great job for a very very decent price. Don&#x27;t see the need to upgrade to any other razor anytime soon.</li>
    <li> My son decided that he wanted to shave like in the old days and has used this razor, he says that it is a little tricky.</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s probably overstating it. HOWEVER, it is the best shave I&#x27;ve had when you couple it with a good shaving soap. The stuff out of a can is terrible for your skin and is makes for a sub-par shave. Seriously, switch to shaving soap. You won&#x27;t regret it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched to a safety razor because electrics make me break out worse than 14 year old boy, the cartridge razors are too darn expensive and shaving with disposables is like shaving with tin foil blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like is said, it shaves very nicely. The fact that my blades only cost nine cents is a major bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as build quality goes, its German built and solid. I have very large hands so I need the longer handle. I have no doubt a that I will still be shaving with this exact razor in 30 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Solid 5 star product.</li>
    <li> Read the reviews and purchased this to replace my Big Brand Name Razor and the Ridiculously priced razors.  Extremely happy with the purchase.  Smoother shave then the Gillette Mach 3 and cheaper replacement blades.</li>
    <li> I got this for my boyfriend and instantly knew he would love it. The handle is a good length, (not too short) which was a big deal since many other shavers I looked at had small, stubby handles. It&#x27;s super sleek and definitely worth the few extra bucks.</li>
    <li> I wished to leave disposable razors behind forever, so I purchased an inexpensive safety razor.  It works but fore my heavy course beard I need to have a razor that locks tightly and does not move.  This was my second one, what a difference.  It is heavy in the hand, precision made and locks tightly in place.  Using the same type blade, it made my first one feel like a dull disposable.</li>
    <li> I just purchased the Merkur razor, it is my first double edge and really like it so far. No issues with it, great look and feel. I am very satisfied. No regret!</li>
    <li> The header is from Homer Simpson.  I remember it from an episode where The SImpsons lived in an old house and homer tries straight razor shaving and tells his family the quote above as Homer shows for it with major nicks and blood squirts.  I ran into an article on how Safety Razors were coming back on the art of manliness website.  All of the benefits of less irritation, bumps, less ingrown hairs, smoother and closer shave and cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this razor with all of the accessories.  One could shave with shaving cream or oil. I tried it with Merkur Razors.  I did not get any nicks on the first shave.  But most younger guys need to know it is an art form.  I had to be careful and pay attention to the pressure on the handle and just let the razor do all of the work.  After 3 passes.  I am a noob and was enjoying the shave and making sure I was learning the technique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did noticed after the first shave, like others have stated.  I did get the closest shave in my life.  Well I have not gone to a barber and gotten a straight shave yet.  My face was very smooth.  Did not feel irritated at all, no bumps, and the after shave just brought everything together very nicely.  I used Proraso After shave. I bought a sampler of safety razors hope to try out other razor blades and finally looking forward to my next shave instead of dreading it.  I can see it as an enjoyable ritual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I compare this shaving to my standard Mach 3 shaving.  I would always have to shave against the grain for better results using the Mach 3.  If I were to shave with the grain, I would feel more of the tugging of the blade on my facial hair.  Would feel more irritated on my skin and bumps.  Plus don&#x27;t get me started on the cost of the cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is going to save me money in the long run.  A box of 100 safety razors for 9 dollars to 20 dollars.  Depending on what your preference is.  20 Cartridge Razors at costco for almost 50-60 dollars every six months.  Since I shave once a week, would come out to almost 120 per year.  Good Bye Gillette.</li>
    <li> I have just switched to this style of razor because like everyone else, the brand name ones that cost this much just for new blades, weren&#x27;t cutting it. Literally, they weren&#x27;t cutting it. I could feel hairs that it missed and it just wasn&#x27;t as close as this one was. I was a bit afraid that I would cut up my face badly, but these work just as well as those. You should not be afraid of them if you are just trying them. It is not as bad as the people make it sound. Just hold it at an angle and you will be fine. I did no worse than the other shaves when I first used this. It is a great value and I am glad I went with this one over the other cheaper one.</li>
    <li> After years of paying through the nose for multi-blade cartridge refills, I decided to give my wallet (and face) a break. I&#x27;d never used a D-E razor before, and was somewhat intimidated by it. After all, I&#x27;d been using cartridge razors since the peach fuzz days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ordered this razor with a pack of Personna blades and an alum block. Am currently using Jack Black Beard Lube with it. First shave: pretty decent. No cuts, but I was being real careful. I wasn&#x27;t as thorough as with the cartridge razor, but shaved again a few days later, this time, more thoroughly, and with much better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, the up front cost of this razor is high, but you can get 100 D-E blades for less than the cost of a pack of four cartridge refills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to getting better at the art of shaving.</li>
    <li> Long story short: awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have ben wet shaving with a double edge for a few years now and I remember looking at the Mercur 180 when I was shopping for my first razor. I passed on it in favor of the Parker 89R for the extra weight the Parker provided. The Parker 89R served me well for about 18 months before the headscrew broke. I then purchased a Mercur Progress, and, being less than enthused, traded it for a 1964 Gillette Slim Adjustable. Now that was a fantastic razor, but it eventually started to clog and didn&#x27;t adjust inline with the settings. I guess I am pretty hard on my razors. I like the non-adjustables the best, so I decided to give Merkur another shot with the Model 180. WOW!!! Whenever I wear out this one I&#x27;ll order another, and then another, and then another.....</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the merkur 180,i got what was advertised and love it.My first and hopfully last safety razor,it works great nice weight and very close shave,i love it,well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor nearly three years ago and it has served me incredibly well. It was my first DE Razor and I didn&#x27;t have any problems with it, no cuts, gashes, or mishaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like all DE Razors the head gets packed with soap residue and every so often I clean it off with some boiling water which restores the luster of the chrome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In hindsight, however, I would&#x27;ve gone with the standard handle length. I haven&#x27;t found myself making use of the extended handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a larger note, DE shavers are everything enthusiasts here and elsewhere have said. They&#x27;re sturdy, cheap, add only a little bit of time to the process of shaving, and provide a superior shave to cartridge based razors. My shaving costs dropped precipitously (I spend now maybe 10 bucks a year on blades... sometimes less).</li>
    <li> My husband is in love with this razor.  I got it for him as a Father&#x27;s Day present and he was really excited to see it.  He&#x27;s told me that the balance is great and there is no pushing needed while shaving.  He&#x27;s able to hold the end of the handle and let the wait of the blade to shave his face.  Awesome Awesome Awesome</li>
    <li> I converted to wet shaving a couple of years ago and was using an old Gillette that I bought used.  I finally decided to get the Merkur and I wish I had done it years ago.  While I will stop short of saying the shaving is now a pleasure, this razor is the best!  I get a close comfortable shave and with the long handle, this razor is very easy to use.  Quality is outstanding.  Well done Merkur!</li>
    <li> Decent razor. I&#x27;ll avoid talking about its shave since that experience can vary significantly depending on your particular beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Build quality is only so so.  Blade fitment and subsequent alignment is average at best. I picked up an Edwin Jagger for a few dollars more and am very pleased with my purchase. It&#x27;s easy to see why many folks have so many razors.</li>
    <li> Saving $300 a year on disposables, shaves just as close ( wth good blades), and my only waste is 100% recyclable. gotta love it.</li>
    <li> One of my reasons for changing to a Merkur was cost.  I&#x27;ve been using a Mach3 for years.  The problem with it is that the unit cost/100ct for their blades is $250.  Compare this with a unit cost/100ct for the Merkur blades, which is $59 and you&#x27;re looking at a bargin.  If you are looking for even greater economy, you can get a dispenser of generic double-edged razors at a unit cost/100ct of $50.     I change the blade once a week, which probably isn&#x27;t necessary, but given the low cost it makes sense to do so just to insure a comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this safety razor 3 times and ended up bleeding each time.  I bought the safety razor based upon an article in Money Magazine.  The article said that you could get a better shave with the much cheaper blades.    I have been using a 4 blade razor for years and got a good close shave and no cuts.  But the cost keeps going up and I was looking for a good shave with a lower cost.  I guess I need to keep looking.  Lesson learned!    This is your father&#x27;s safety razor (old technology).</li>
    <li> This shaver will last me for the rest of my life because it is stainless steel. One steel blade gave me close shaves for over a month. I like long lasting, non-disposable solution to things. The shaver will last 30 years, I can reuse the blades for other things around the house. Great shaves. Great economics. Nothing disposable.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor because I was tired of spending a lot of money on replacement blades for my other razors and the cheap disposable kind just weren&#x27;t doing a good job.  After doing some research I found that most people purchase the Merkur Razors, but prefer other blades.  I ended up getting this model, but use &amp;#34;Feather brand Hi-Stainless Platinum Blades&amp;#34;.  If you go with those blades make sure you check the shipping costs.  The blades are fairly inexpensive, but seem to ship mostly from oversees (I am in the U.S.).  As for this razor, I am very pleased.  I was mostly worried about cutting myself while shaving prior to purchasing.  That has not been an issue.  I am now getting another one as a Christmas present for my brother.</li>
    <li> Gives a very clean and close shave. I also like that the blade gets warm from the warm water I use to rinse it as I shave. I doubt I&#x27;ll ever go back to disposable razors.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor a little over a month ago, however due to a busy work schedule I only had the time to use it a few days ago.   All I can say is \\&quot;WOW!\\&quot;. This thing cuts VERY CLOSE provided you position the razor at a correct angle to your face. I have done some research online and apparently what you should shoot for is a thirty degree angle from the razor blade&#x27;s edge to your face. I must admit it is a little unnerving at first shaving with this razor because you can actually hear and feel the whiskers being cut-similar to the sound made if you were to rub your hand over sandpaper. You want to be sure you use plenty of shaving cream and frequently wet the razor either in a filled sink or under the faucet. Also you need to use very short shaving strokes relative to say a mach 3 or another modern razor. This is to ensure that the correct angle is maintained. One final thing to remember is that you don&#x27;t need to press the razor into the skin to shave closely-you will cut yourself if you attempt this. The weight of this razor is significant relative to today&#x27;s plastic versions and the weight of it alone is plenty to make good contact with your skin.</li>
    <li> My previous shaving experiences consisted of an electric razor, and using mach3 cartridge razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was growing unsatisfied with the poor quality of the shave the cartridge razor was giving me, and how expensive it was to replace the blades on an electric razor or cartridge razor. I decided to take the plunge and use an old fashioned double edge safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever since early 2009, I have been using the Derby Extra razor blades, this Merkur long handled razor, and the Proraso eucalyptus oil shaving cream, and the difference is amazing. I receive much closer shaves, with far fewer ingrown hairs, and an almost complete disappearance of razor burns and razor bumps. I barely even need to use an aftershave lotion, although before if I skipped this step my skin and neck would be red and angry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not cut myself with this razor yet, and feel it places the blade at a perfect angle. Less pressure is better. The natural weight presses it down about as much as you want: don&#x27;t dig into your face or drag it along, just let it skim along the surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Replacing blades is incredibly easy. Cleaning it is very easy. I am very glad I bought the long handled version - anything shorter would be awkward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are still slogging through a tedious, painful, and unsatisfactory shaving experience using overpriced cartridge razors, I highly recommend making the switch. Keep your face wet and exercise caution, and you can use a safety razor in perfect safety. As I say, 18 months later, I haven&#x27;t cut my face once.</li>
    <li> Used everyday,sturdy and well made. I do wish the blade angle was adjustable.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been shaving with a safety razor for too long (only a couple of months), and this is the first one I&#x27;ve used. Now, with that in mind I can tell you I&#x27;ve liked it very much. It is very comfortable to use; I specially appreciate the long handle and the weight (which helps you shave). It also looks and feels sturdy, so I guess (though remember I don&#x27;t have much experience) it will last at least a couple of years.    Nota bene: Blades are really important, so be very careful when choosing them. Though I lack much experience I can assure you the coolest razor will be worth less without decent blades.</li>
    <li> Excellent weight, nice smooth shave. Does not pull! Never going back to multi- blade shaving again!</li>
    <li> Shaving old school was a transformative experience. Something about the feel, the weight, even the sound. I want my beard to grow twice as fast so I can shave twice as much.</li>
    <li> First and only DE razor that I have used, no complaints at all after almost a year!</li>
    <li> I love this razor. Bought it last year when I started on my classic shaving kick and haven&#x27;t used any other razor. I am using the Merkur blades as well. The combo provides an extremely close shave. I&#x27;ve got extremely sensitive skin and this thing tore my face up hardcore for the first week or two, but I acclimated to it and now the only time I bleed is if I nick a pimple or get too careless with it while tired.     Only reason I gave it 4 stars was because mine had started to rust on the underside where the blade is held in place. Granted I do leave it in the shower, but I do clear all soap out of it with warm/hot water. It does not affect the shave and the metal is so thick it would take decades before it ate through the razor. The handle itself looks brand new though.</li>
    <li> Makes shaving a pleasure and you can see and feel the quality in this product. This will be a hand me down in generations to come.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to review this in reverse order, having considered some of the lesser ratings.    Several people stated that they cut themselves with this \\&quot;safety\\&quot; razor. That makes sense: it does house a sharp blade. I&#x27;m 68 and while I can remember cutting myself with a straight razor occasionally, safety razor cuts are a rare occurence. Bless them all, there are people who frequently cut themselves with paper, glass, knives, and even safety razors; others, like me, seem to be largely immune. Therefore, I would not rate this razor on the basis of its proclivity to inflict extraneous cuts. In my hands, when applied to an adequately softened/lubricated beard, cuts are rare.    Some went on to mention that changing blades is dangerous. Now that word - dangerous - is relative, no? I load shotshell for skeet and .40 cal ball ammo for silhouette shooting - both of which I consider minimally dangerous. At 68 I still ride my Harley Low Rider without a helmet in NM: a great danger to some. There is a review here at Amazon by someone who considers hot air popcorn poppers dangerous because some of the kernels pop when in the bowl sending popcorn flying (they were worried about their small child becoming blinded by flying popcorn). Obviously then, people whose lives are fraught with danger or who, otherwise, place themselves at great risk when using various implements should avoid the occasions of danger, whatever that entails. The thought occurs to me that, if razors are a danger, then electric shavers might be the answer. Then I thought of the shock hazard.    One reviewer dispelled the notion that using the Merkur was a life changing event. Then I noticed that there were 11 people who agreed with that statement. This gave me long pause: I wondered what state of psyche does one have to enjoy before considering whether a safety razor has the potential to change one&#x27;s life or attitude thereabout. It&#x27;s a razor!    Not to be wiseacre but I was further impelled to incredulity to read one&#x27;s lament that, after bouncing his Merkur off the floor of the shower, he was surprised that it broke. If I was a wiseacre I might have replied duh . . . !    There were a few reviewers that, to me, implied that it took a team of experts to change the blades (unlike the older Gillette-style butterfly head that spread its wings and spit its blade asunder). Let&#x27;s see: unscrew the handle, separate the head into its two pieces, remove and discard the blade, insert the new blade, assemble the two head pieces, replace the handle, then what . . . take a nap to recover? Really?    Did you note that review by the large guy with big hands who dissed the long handle? Perhaps he&#x27;s used to holding small things.    Finally, there are a few who noted the lack of closeness to their shaves.    What is the Merkur safety razor to me? Primarily, it is an instrument designed to render a satisfactorily close shave at a much reduced cost when compared to today&#x27;s options, especially cartridge systems. To date, the Gillette Mach3 has been the all-time best-selling razor and here, at Amazon, one can purchase a 12-pack of Mach3 blades for $22; 8 Mach3 Turbos for $18. I purchased 100 DE blades for $8. Let&#x27;s see, that&#x27;s $1.83 for the M3s, $2.25 for the M3 Turbos, and $0.08 for the DE - EACH. Let me put it this way, the M3s cost 23 times, and the M3 Turbos cost 28 times what the DE blades cost. I like math: it costs $183 for the same number of M3 turbos that I pay $8 for in DE blades. Okay, enough math.    The weight of this Merkur, plus blade, is 2.2oz: the head plus blade is 1.2 oz; the handle is 1oz. In my hands, the combination of the long handle and balanced weight is ideal. Then too, I&#x27;m used to handling long things. Apart from empirically defining the balance of the Merkur, in the end, how it feels in one&#x27;s hands is a matter of preference. I prefer the weight and heft of the Merkur to that of the M3, e.g.     Finally, as one very good reviewer - M.D.C. The Franchise - noted, the use ofany DE safety razor requires two things: an adequately softened/moistened beard (I usually shave in the shower so that is, for me, is a non-issue) and time: if your life consists of anticlimactic quickies, you probably do not want to consider the DE safety razor.</li>
    <li> This being my very first DE razor I guess my opinion is a little narrow but this razor is great. It has never once cut my face or given me so much as a nick. It gives a very close smooth shave and works very well.</li>
    <li> good razor, been using for nearly a year and have not had to buy new blades (bought 100 pack of Derby blades for $10). Great if you want an old school shave or are trying to save some money.</li>
    <li> It accepts generic blades like a champ and handles like a dream. It goes around contours, like the chin, easily. All in all, I am getting the best and most comfortable shave of my life with this baby, and it was very inexpensive.</li>
    <li> I like this razor. I can&#x27;t say I have experience with a lot of different razors, but I read a lot of reviews before buying it and the manufacturer came highly recommended so I bought it. Also, the replacements blades are readily available at grocery stores and pharmacies and are inexpensive compared to the replacement blades for contemporary style razors.</li>
    <li> Nice grip, but disappointed the chrome looked half done.</li>
    <li> I have been wet shaving for a year now. I had a parker razor, it was good, then I move up to a Edwin Jaeger ,it was better than the Parker. While cleaning the bathroom my wife dropped the razor and it broke. Well that gave me a reason to try another razor, the Merkur long handle 180. After my first shave I thanked my wife for breaking the Jaeger.Wow what a great shave ,no cuts, or scraps just pure clean smooth shave . Bottom line,line buy this razor and you will write a rave review too.</li>
    <li> Love this razor.  Nice and hefty.  Very easy to change blade.  Good grip.  Shaves like a dream.  One setting.</li>
    <li> Outstanding product, love it!!!</li>
    <li> Same as others have reported. The screw on the top piece corroded and broke off when tightening. Purchased in 2013. Look for a better made razor.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I was looking for a cheaper substitute to disposable razors. Just got it in the mail today and shaved with it. It&#x27;s a pain just opening it and putting the blade in. I had about a two day beard and after shaving it felt like my face by the end of the day after using a cheap disposable razor in the morning.  I even shaved a second time right after using this razor and my face felt the same. I am extremely disappointed that I wasted $30 dollars on something like this.</li>
    <li> Excellent razor, great shave.</li>
    <li> made the switch from expensive gillet 20 blade razors, or whatever number they are up to now. I get a way closer shave with this, when i use it with feather blades. Been shaving with this one for over a year now, and its still perfect. This thing will last me for a lifetime i think.</li>
    <li> After using this razor for three months, I am a convert for life. The razor burn I used to suffer through is a thing of the past, I get fewer ingrown hairs and have virtually no razor bumps. At first it was hard to believe that I could get a shave this close from something so elegantly simple, but take it from me, it works. My wife loves the shave I get from the Merkur, and like many other gentlemen have mentioned, the shave is so close I can shave at night, go without the next morning, and still look great at work all day.     Should you buy one of these - or any safety razor - do yourself a favor and get some shaving soap and a brush. I thought I could get away with using the rest of canned shaving cream I had been using, but I thought wrong.  The lather was the wrong texture for the Merkur, resulting in a less than great shave. Once I picked up a soap and brush, the change was immediately obvious - the Merkur effortlessly moved across my face, the shave was closer, and my skin actually felt better. You don&#x27;t even have to spend much at first.  The [[ASIN:B001A3HPT0 Van Der Hagen Premium Shave Set (Soap, Bowl, Brush)]] comes with a Soap, a Bowl, and a Brush for around $12 here at Amazon, or you can hit up your local drugstore.     Oh, and as for costs?  Compared to what I used to spend on cartridges and canned shaving creams and gels, there is no contest. The Merkur was $38 when I bought it, the soap puck was $4, my brush was another $6 or so, and I spent $16 on 100 [[ASIN:B0017ZECA6 100 7a.m. Platinum Double Edge Safety Razor Blades]] (about .16 per blade).  Three months later, I&#x27;m still using the same soap puck, my brush is still in great shape, and I change the blade about once, sometimes twice a week. The Merkur itself will still be around after I&#x27;m dead and buried. I will never go back to cartridges again.</li>
    <li> I ordered this razor based on the positive feedback on Amazon.  When I got it, it just didn&#x27;t work.  The blade sat too close to the metal on which it sat.  I scoured the internet for shaving instructions, thinking that maybe I was doing it wrong.  No matter what I did this razor just didn&#x27;t work for me... so I returned it to Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I ordered the Merkur Futur Double Edge Safety Razor #700, which is adjustable, to see if that would work better for me.  It does indeed!  So now that I have a basis for comparison, I can honestly say that this razor just doesn&#x27;t cut it (pun intended).  The Futur works great, though it more than twice as expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good news is that it is really easy to return this razor to Amazon if it doesn&#x27;t work for you, so there&#x27;s not really any risk involved.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve spent along time sitting on the fence when it came to a safety razor.  Gillette hooked me early on their fusion line when they sent me a free sample in high school.  Hats off to Gillette&#x27;s marketing department, I have used the fusion for the last 5 years.  However, I started to be unsatisfied with the results.  The area under my chin would constantly get intractable razor burn, and if I missed a single day of shaving, the blades felt like they were pulling my hair out instead of slicing it off.  Not only that, the cartridges only last two weeks and cost a fortune.    I had finally had enough.  After doing some research, I decided to go with this Merkur, the Tweezerman brush and some Psoraso soap, as part of the bundle Amazon has.  It has not disappointed.    My first shave I was expecting to look like something out of one of the Saw movies.  I bought a styptic pencil and had band-aids at the ready.  Instead what I got was an incredibly close, irritation free shave.  No nicks, no cuts, no drama.  Seriously, just use the lightest of pressure and this razor mows down whiskers like they are pedestrians in Grand Theft Auto.  Now my face is smooth enough to use as a non-stick cooking surface, and I feel manly enough to star in an Old Spice commercial.    Pros:  -Incredibly close shave  -Irritation free  -Inexpensive  -Not as hard as it looks  -Incredibly manly    Cons:  -You need to use some care, and it takes a little longer that the Fusion.</li>
    <li> I tried a few of the discount razors, but this is definitely worth the money</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful razor! I&#x27;ve been shaving with this system for a little over a year and it has transformed my shaving experience into A necessary evil I once dreaded to something I now look forward to. The build quality is top-notch and will last a lifetime. It&#x27;s also done wonders for my skin. Paired with a nice blade like Astra, irritated skin, razor bumps, and ingrown hairs are things of the past because unlike cartridges, safety razors don&#x27;t first pull the hair out and then cut it below the skin line.  Secondly, because the blades are only a few cents, I use a new blade every few shaves without hesitation whereas my cartridge using friends stretch them to the point where they are painfully dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you use a real razor, either a safety razor, or a straight edge (if you&#x27;re a bit more daring), you will see that cartridge systems are complete ripoffs sold to unsuspecting consumers with clever marketing.</li>
    <li> Let me just start off with the fact that I&#x27;m 16. I don&#x27;t have the heaviest cheek whickers but my neck grows like a wildfire. And I&#x27;ve been using the Gillette fushion proglide since I as 12 and it probably worked well when I was up to the age of 14 because puberty was still running its coarse on my face. But since last year I&#x27;ve noticed that the Gillettes are terrible. They last 6 shaves, you have only 1 choice on to what type of cartridge head you want to use, and they were super expensive for my dad when he had to buy 2 packs of 8 blades for a total of 60 bucks!!! What a rip off. I showed my 10 year old little brother the prices for 8 Gillette heads (30 bucks) compared to 100 Astra blades (10 bucks) and this was his face :O.    So one day I was watching History Channel and a commercial came on with the bald headed guy in pawn stars advertising a safety razor (not this one). And I thought to myself, &#x27;&#x27; This looks pretty cool, I&#x27;m gonna check this out&#x27;&#x27;. So I went to Amazon to check out what this &#x27;wet shaving&#x27; trend was about. I found a wide selection of stainless steel, butterfly doors, completely unscrewable, and even weirdly angled safety razors. To play it safe, I bought the one that sold the most and had the best reviews (this one).    The package arrived 2 days later and what struck me right out the box was the sheer beauty of the stainless steel chrome finish of this razor. I don&#x27;t know what it is about taking apart a stainless steel razor and putting in a sharp double edge blade that makes me feel manly. But appearance isn&#x27;t the most important aspect of a razor, it&#x27;s the quality of the shave. Now, this is totally subjective to the type of blade you use because everyone has different facial hair which entails needing different blades, but the razor does play a role in how much it protects your skin with the guard. It was the best shave of my life. The shave was so close and I had no irritation, nicks, or razor burn. It shocked me that I&#x27;ve been struggling withan overpriced piece of plastic garbage for a whole year before switching to the Murker Safety Razor.    This is a warning: Once you get into wet shaving, you won&#x27;t stop. Since my purchase of this product I&#x27;ve bought a boar hair shaving brush, Proraso shaving soap, clubman aftershave, Astra and Personna blades, another safety razor, and I&#x27;m considering getting myself a shavette straight razor to then get myself a traditional straight razor in the future.    I strongly recommend this product if you&#x27;re currently using that atrocious 5 blade cartridge razor. This product, along with what comes with wet shaving, will pay for itself in the long run and It&#x27;ll cost more to start off for the Murker but it&#x27;ll last a lifetime. My grandpa still has his safety razor from the 1960&#x27;s and with a mere polish it&#x27;ll look brand new.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m well versed in using straight razors to shave, and have never had a problem with straight razors nor with today&#x27;s disposables. I went looking for a safety razor to get away from plastic disposables (being the mighty recycler that I am) while still being able to get the shaving job done quickly (straight razors take a while, for obvious reasons). The Merkur Model 180 has great reviews, with top marks for quality of device and quality of shave, so I ordered it.    Two painful shaves later, I am sorry I bought this tool. Not only did the razor fail to shave closely, it took off enough layers of skin so that I was left feeling sunburned. I&#x27;m not sending it back, because after the re-stocking fee and shipping, it&#x27;s just not worth it.     Maybe it&#x27;s me. Maybe the skin on my face is just not tough enough for this sort of razor. All I can say is that I&#x27;ve never had this issue with a straight razor, nor any of the modern disposables. And to boot, the shave was absolutely NOT as good as today&#x27;s multi-blade disposables.    Another mark against this item is that the blade is only good for two shaves. Honestly, dispoables last a good ten shaves for me, so the cost difference would be $5 for replacement blades for the Merkur or $1 for each disposable.    Definitely disappointing. Overall higher ongoing costs plus a whole lot more physical pain mean I&#x27;m putting this puppy on eBay. Or giving it to my brother-in-law.</li>
    <li> great razor, great price too</li>
    <li> This is a solid safety razor for anyone interested in classic wet shaving.  I find the &amp;#34;long&amp;#34; handle to be a normal length.  I can&#x27;t imagine shaving with a shorter handle.  The system of screwing in the blade doesn&#x27;t allow for adjustment, but the angle works fine for me.</li>
    <li> After using this for 3 days, suddenly I&#x27;m growing a mustache!  And I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard!  (I also bought the razors by the same manufacturer).  I was eagerly looking forward to going &#x27;old school&#x27; and use the same type of razor &#x27;technology&#x27; that my father used.  It&#x27;s a pity, but this just doesn&#x27;t get the job done.  The Dollar Shave Club&#x27;s $1 razors are much better than this.</li>
    <li> A good entry level safety razor to those who are thinking about delving to safety razor shaving but do not want to spend a fortune on something they are just trying out. You will not be disappointed with purchasing this razor and while it is not adjustable, the stock shave is very comfortable and this is a well crafted razor. The length of the handle is the length of any average 2-blade disposable razor but is not obscenely long, so for those with big hands, this will fit comfortably in them. With a quality blade, and shave kit you will save money over the long haul by owning this safety razor.</li>
    <li> After searching for a good quality, and cost effective razor, I found this one... At first the $30 price tag worried me a little ($$$ is tight as a college student), but I decided to take the plunge. After using the razor for a few months, it has been flawless. However, these razors are very sharp! So, if you like to update your Facebook status or text your significant other, look elsewhere. But, if you like a very close shave without the cartridge BS, this is DEFINITELY for you. I usually use my edge shaving cream in a can mainly because i&#x27;m cheap, but I recommend using shaving soap with this razor.</li>
    <li> Hands down, safety razors beat cartridge razors for their simplicity, ease of maintenance, and low blade cost. The only reason I gave this razor 3 stars is because compared to other safety razors (specifically the Edwin Jagger de89), the fit and finish of this razor is sub par.   It came in a cheap box with a low-quality Merkur blade. This blade has been panned on the shaving forums I&#x27;ve visited. You should immediately find a better blade. There were small blemishes on the handle and jagged edges on the underside of the head. It&#x27;s light weight (which isn&#x27;t always a good thing), so it&#x27;s not as easy to control as a heavier weight razor. The handle is pencil thin but the knurling provides a decent grip. The shave is slightly more aggressive than the Edwin Jagger, so the EJ might be more suitable for beginners.  These things I mentioned are nit picks. Overall I got a good shave with this razor using Derby blades and I plan on keeping it as a travel razor. But for the same price, there are better quality alternatives.</li>
    <li> Hubby loves it. I love his super soft skin and the way he feels all dapper these days. 5 stars and no regrets.</li>
    <li> I learned to shave with a safety razor, but had started using the multi-bladed cartridge razors for their advertised smooth shave. The cartridges became so costly that I decided to return to a safety razor. I&#x27;m so glad I did. The razor is a bit pricey, but the blades are very reasonable. Most importantly, the shave is close, smooth and comfortable. I particularly appreciate the Merkur simple and effective design.</li>
    <li> Beautiful!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I agree with a previous poster, Warning It&#x27;s a razor. You&#x27;ve got to love people, right? Anyway, this is a nice quality razor for it&#x27;s price. They are hard to find without spending large amounts of money. But yes, razor blades can be dangerous, no kidding people.</li>
    <li> Nice long handle, good for big hands.  The weight is good and it&#x27;s easy to change blades.  A good introduction to safety razor shaving.</li>
    <li> I had been shaving with a quality electric razor for years before doing some research on double edged safety razors.  I wanted to make the switch primarily because of the constant razor burn I had to deal with on my neck.  After just the first use with this Merkur long handled razor, the razor burn that typically came up within an hour after shaving had nearly entirely disappeared.  After just two weeks of use, my razor burn was completely gone (I also use a noncomedogenic post-shave moisturizer.)  If there&#x27;s one thing I want to share with this review it is: MAKE THE SWITCH!  I&#x27;m saving much more money than buddies who use the new proglide manual razors who waste an obscene amount of money on replaceable blades.  It&#x27;s pretty easy to get used to, but takes a bit more time to shave (around 10 minutes for me,) but I think it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
    <li> Perfect starter double edge razor. read and research before use for best outcome, also pick up a few different type of blades to try. Definitely a better shave that Mach3 or Fusion razors!</li>
    <li> I didnt think I enjoyed shaving. That is until I started with this.   My first razor came in the mail to me when i was 16, a Mach 3. I have used these cartridge systems for the past 11 years and never been impressed. When the cartridges arent clogging with hair they still go dull in a few uses. I would have two or three razors sitting around at all times, not wanting to throw them away because they cost so much but not wanting to use them because I knew they would eat up my face. After reading artofmanliness.com I decided I was going to give the double edge safety razor a try. This model was my choice due to its value and wonderful ratings. I couldnt be happier with my decision. Along with my soap, mug, and brush this makes shaving a pleasant experience while providing a shave much closer than I have experienced with any 2, 3, or 4 blade system. Turns out one well manufactured razor and blade is all you need. Stay away from those overpriced plastic razors and go with something that will last forever and save you tons of cash.  Never going back.</li>
    <li> For years I have used a Sensor Excel razor from Gillette, but recently the ridiculous cost of cartridges has driven me to search for a simpler and equal or better solution. This Merkur is not it that solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the blade that came with it, this safety razor takes me 5x as long to shave with as the Sensor Excel -- even after pass after pass of with grain, side grain, and against grain stokes it doesn&#x27;t give as close a shave as the Sensor Excel does in 1/5th the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor is of nice quality, but is ill balanced and clumsy with large and heavy head and does not deliver a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I simply cannot understand the high rating.</li>
    <li> This is my first and only safety razor, and I&#x27;m very pleased.  Although I have nothing to compare it against, I have enjoyed this razor, and the routine it&#x27;s afforded me, immensely.  At first I was a little disappointed by the way blades are loaded (it comes apart in three pieces, excluding the blade; at first this seemed like a hassle), but now I really appreciate the simplicity of the design.  No moving parts &#x3D; nothing to break.  :)</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic razor! It took a couple shaves before I got the hang of it, but when it did... totally worth it!</li>
    <li> Feels great in my hand, nice heft, long handle is nice for larger hands. precision instrument. I enjoy the how the heavy metal parts hold in the heat of the hot water, and makes for a very comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> This is my first safety razor and I absolutely love it.  It takes no longer than a normal razor to shave and the shave is incredibly close.  I only nicked myself once and I&#x27;m not blaming the razor for it.  I would definitely recommend this razor to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still very new to DE shaving so my opinion is far from expert.  The first razor I got was an edwin jagger de89 and i really like it.  My girlfriend got me this razor as a gift; not knowing i already had a razor.  The merkur does a great job especially for a starter razor.  In a head to head though, I would prefer the jagger, it is around the same price and it&#x27;s fit and finish is superior to the merkur.</li>
    <li> Husband loves this new razor and will not be going back to anything with more blades.</li>
    <li> My fiancé loves this razor! It&#x27;s such a nice alternative to throw aways! We are very Eco conscience so this is perfect!</li>
    <li> Just like all the other reviews, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this razor.&lt;br /&gt;Has a solid feel and weight to it. Very satisfied with my first DE razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would also recommend buying a variety pack of different blades to see which one you prefer.&lt;br /&gt;The one blade that comes with the razor is considered by many as a middle of the road blade.</li>
    <li> Fine craftsmanship, nice heft.  Top notch shaving experience.</li>
    <li> This razor is simply outstanding. The shave is really smooth, comfortable and very close. I have wasted lots of money on many of those popular typical razors with five blades on it or whatever and none of them can hold a candle to the Merkur 180. The razor is also unbelievably easy to clean, it doesn&#x27;t get clogged up or nasty at all. Just a quick rinse off, and its clean. Its remarkably sturdy and has a simple design with just three pieces that unscrew by hand, so replacing blades and maintaining is cake. Then the replacement blades are dirt cheap so it pays for itself, no more wasting money. I have to give it five stars.</li>
    <li> I gave this  as a gift to my husband for Christmas. He likes it a lot! It has a nice balanced weight and the long handle works well in his fairly large hands. One surprise, although not necessarily a drawback, is the way the razor opens; it opens by twisting the head, not the end of the handle as I&#x27;ve seen in other safety razors I&#x27;ve seen. It&#x27;s not a problem though because it puts your hands in the correct place to change the blade. A nice razor!</li>
    <li> Actually, this was a Christmas gift for my husband.  He was tired of paying too much for blades for the razors he had been using.  I make shaving soap, so he uses a brush and my soap.  This one works like a charm and he is very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m brand new to the de safety razor experience, new as in I just shaved with this about 20 minutes ago for the first time ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was excited to give this a whirl, I have to say it did not dissapoint at all, it exceeded expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;History:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been shaving some 30 years now, I&#x27;ve tried electrics (not my bag at all) however, I&#x27;ve mostly stuck to the disposable and cartridge razor scene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never been much of a snob about razors, they&#x27;ve always been a decent means to an end and they&#x27;ve been consistent. What drew me to the safety razors was a blog article (or two) on the comeback of these guys. The articles mainly went over cost of disposables and cartidges + the waste, they also covered the re-manning up happening throughout the land (about time yes?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Experiment:&lt;br /&gt;I perfomed a lot of research on the subject of shaving (probably WAY more than necessary for shaving but, I was having fun and discoving a new subculture.) I discovered a LOT of places to buy some really shiny products for a lot of money. This started to get me nervous, I didn&#x27;t want to get into another expensive hobby/habbit, guitars take a lot of my budget for that. This razor came highly recomended on those sites and the cost was just a tad too high, double than here. $33 for this razor is a DEAL man, seriously, as a cost of entry here it&#x27;s completely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the razor on rush delivery. I have to say I was nervous after reading some of the negative reviews. I had no idea if I was going to get either a cool shave or a trip to the er for a face transplant (they do that now :))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Outcome:&lt;br /&gt;Holy Schnikies Man!!! This thing rocks!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea what was up with the dudes who gave the 1 stars, this thing is easy. It&#x27;s a quality razor, put together very well. I have never used a DE safety razor before, after reading those coments I was SURE that this was going to require some blood sacrifice... Not onesingle nick... Not a one.. In fact, this was this first time in at least a month that I hadn&#x27;t cut myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it, you&#x27;ll like it (unless you&#x27;re \\&quot;that guy\\&quot;, don&#x27;t be \\&quot;that guy\\&quot;.)</li>
    <li> Alright, just to clear things up I fall into that category of young people that got tired of those disposable blades made in China that just burn up my face. Now that I got that out of the way...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product Review:&lt;br /&gt;First double safety I ever bought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Solid Design, Probably last forever if taken care of&lt;br /&gt;Nice Chrome look&lt;br /&gt;Comes with one platinum Merkur Blade Blade&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s about the size of a typical razor, but a bit heavier. This gives it a more solid feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Outrageous price for something so simple&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t arrive with anything else.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe too heavy? Still gives me razor burn in one section of my neck due to the weight of it. I might just need to improve me technique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, if I did some more research I could probably found something for 1/10th the price that would do the same job. It leaves me a bit sour, but all in all it is classy. Can&#x27;t complain, would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> Hands down..this is the best item I have ever raked my face with.</li>
    <li> I studied up on this pretty hard.  I read the top review here.  I watched a number of instructional videos, including mantic59&#x27;s (found out about him by way of his articles on the same for Lifehacker).  Actually stalled on purchasing it, squeezing some more use out of my 2 and 3-blade Gilette razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I finally bit the bullet, made my purchase.  When it arrived, I hadn&#x27;t shaved that morning, so I tried it out right away.  My first thought: \\&quot;Wow, oh wow, why didn&#x27;t I do this sooner?\\&quot;  The long handle was about right for my beefy hands.  I had some problems with bumps but remembered my lessons and didn&#x27;t make any cuts at all (that I could see)-- and this was INCLUDING my neck area.  I usually shave around a goatee (moustache and beard) and loved the better precision compared to my multi-bladed Gilettes.  I can&#x27;t remember when I had a shave as close as this one, and asked the missus to take a feel to confirm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a relatively dry shave in comparison to the next day (yesterday); I shave after visits to the gym as they have a steam room.  It was easier of course but I was still impressed (as I was relatively rushed for time).  My studying paid off and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll have trouble adjusting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t stepped up to shaving soap and a brush yet, although I will eventually for cost-effective considerations.  I did fairly well with a gel foam and tea tree oil (using the oil to touch up).  I&#x27;ll also be looking at blades.  The included blade was nice but I have no replacements; will check at the local drugstores before looking again online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one&#x27;s a long-term keeper for sure!</li>
    <li> First safety razor I&#x27;ve had and loving it. Paired with the Dorco ST301 Platinum Extra Double Edge Razor Blades and can&#x27;t imagine going back to the multi-blade overpriced gilletes that I used to use. Shaving takes more time now, but it is enjoyable and the results are great!</li>
    <li> My shaving story. I started shaving around 1970 with a hand-me-down Gillette butterfly DE razor. In early 1972 a Gillette Trac 2 arrived free in the mail packaged in a little metal can. Yea, they still get you the same way today with that free handle. Then began my sacrilegious wet shaving with plastic blades. My wife always bought my blades so I was really stupid about their history. One day I stopped at the corner drug store to pick up some blades. I saw a long counter of mounted boxes with tear off labels below them. It turns out razor blades are about the cost of gold per ounce and have to be locked up because blades are the #1 shop-lifted product in the USA, even locked up. I suppose the store employees can&#x27;t even afford to buy them, if you get my drift. And so began the Great Google Safety Razor Research Project. I have always used a brush and mug soap, so to go \\&quot;traditional\\&quot; wet shaving all I needed was a double edge razor.&lt;br /&gt;I chose the Merkur 180 long handle for several reasons including the price. I thought the longer handle would give me more control, which you don&#x27;t need because the razor does the work for you. I do like it better than the short handles I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;The M 180 is a 3 piece razor so there are no moving parts to get misaligned. I have read that they are harder to change the blade in but I haven&#x27;t had any problems.&lt;br /&gt;There was not much of a learning curve with this razor, I had only a few nicks. I did find that the best blades for this razor and my face are 7AM blades (not 7 o&#x27;clock). Go ahead and buy a cheap alum block also and you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> This is a simple, well-built safety razor, but purchasers need to be aware that it won&#x27;t work with all double-edged blades.  Obviously it will work with Merkur blades (a sample comes with the razor), but Personna blades, at about 1/4 the cost of Merkurs, aren&#x27;t wide enough to expose the cutting edge.</li>
    <li> I am a blade user for life.</li>
    <li> As a guy who sticks to what he likes in all areas of his life \\&quot;you like what you like\\&quot;, I couldn&#x27;t believe I had taken so long to discover such a great shave.  With some simple tools you can have a closer shave than many other products.  The extra time, which has turned out to be not very much extra, is very worth it.  This product is well-balanced and has a quality feel in your hand.  Coupled with a decent badger hair brush, good shave soap, Feather blades and hot water I get the best shave I have ever had.  Read the other reviews about the savings over time, the simplicity, and the lack of waste and see for yourself.  Sometimes simpler is better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 26 and have been shaving with Gillette Multi-Blade cartridges since I was 15 which includes using the 5 blade Fusion for the past few years. Four years of being in the Army and I was extremely put off by the thought of having to shave and I&#x27;d go a week or more to avoid doing it and inevitably getting razor burn after the first two or three uses of the cartridge. Then there was the outrageous prices and with a reduction in income I went looking for a cheaper alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the Merkur 180 Long Handle through Lifehacker.com when they reviewed ways to save money shaving and enjoy it at the same time. I cannot say enough about this blade! I&#x27;ve used it twice with the Merkur blade it came with and it does an excellent job. The learning curve wasn&#x27;t too steep and by my second shave I was going quickly and I didn&#x27;t nick myself or get razor burn from it either time. My third shave I tried a Derby blade and it tore up my face so I&#x27;m back on the hunt for blades that are sharp yet forgiving on someone with sensitive skin and medium beard thickness. I ordered a small amount of Astra blades and if those don&#x27;t work out I&#x27;ll go with the Merkur blades (they do a fine job, but leave some stubble on the bottom of my chin) since I know they work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definately get a badger hair brush and some good shaving cream for lathering your face! It works and feels wonderful. I can actually look forward to shaving now instead of dreading it. So far one good shave with the original Merkur blade keeps my face completely smooth for the better part of a day (16-18hrs) and leaves me with a very light stubble the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first and hopefully last razor purchase (definitely get the long handle if you have big hands). Not only does it perform excellent, it will quickly pay for itself! I love telling my buddies that I can get 100 blades for less than the price of their multi-blade cartridge 4 packs of Gillette/Shick etc.</li>
    <li> For years I swore by cartridge razors. After using the Merkur, I will never go back to them. The double edge razor (both this particular model and all in general) is superior for two reasons:    1. Closer shave (You won&#x27;t be able to stop touching your face in amazement)  2. Less costly blades (I just bought a 2 year supply of razor blades for $20, compare that with what would cost about $300 if you bought 2 years worth of Fusion or Mach 3 cartridges)    It&#x27;s a win-win. You&#x27;ll never go back.</li>
    <li> This razor is a gateway drug, plain and simple. I bought it about a year ago solely for the purpose of saving money on blades. The razor has saved me quite a bit of cash, blades for it are an eighth of what my old razor cost me. More than that, though, it&#x27;s awakened in me something that sounds vaguely dorky to say out loud but feels deeply satisfying to know -- I now enjoy shaving. It used to be a task, an annoying thing that I&#x27;d do as fast as possible as infrequently as possible. The more I used the Merkur, the more I looked forward to my daily shave. I no longer felt the sting of razor burn and I was getting a far closer shave than I&#x27;d ever had in the eight years since I started shaving. Now putting a blade in the razor was something worth smiling about, knowing I was going to get a great shave. But there was a problem -- squirting a dollop of shaving cream out of an aerosol can was no longer enough. I needed more. I had to disassemble and re-assemble my razor with every shave, surely the cream that I was using with it deserved the same attention to detail. The next thing I knew, I had a mug full of shaving soap and a badger hair brush. I&#x27;ve graduated to the world of wet shaving, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it. I&#x27;m getting an unbeatable shave and from the low-rent to (most of) the high-end materials, wet shaving is still cheaper than most \\&quot;modern\\&quot; shaving creams, razors and blades.</li>
    <li> More manly to shave this way somehow.  Looking back at my electric shaver days....  this is faster and closer.  Except under my nose.  If I am not careful when shaving from different whisker grain directions, I actually have sliced my nostril more than a few times now.  Not like \\&quot;The Big Shave\\&quot; (1967 Martin Scorsese)--look it up, but not happy I have been doing this.  Not on the cutting edge, but the razor&#x27;s short edge that overhangs from the sides of the guards.</li>
    <li> I&#x60;m new to double-edged shaving and was recommended from online reviews to use Merkur brand razors for first-timers; received as ordered and described, easy to handle and use, handle length is appropriate</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift for my husband, and he loves this razor. In particular, he likes the long handle. One thing: the blades are hard to find in stores where we live, so we ordered more from Amazon. I&#x27;d recommend buying a pack of replacement blades at the time of purchase.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product. After using it, you will feel and look like a million bucks! The quality of craftsmanship is readily apparent and the products packaging is elegant, efficient, and handsome.</li>
    <li> Be careful not to cut yourself</li>
    <li> Switch to this from mach3. I no longer get razor burn or pimples after shaving. The only drawback is that you have to make two passes to get a close, clean shave. Feels good to shave like a man rather than a sissy whose wallet gets raped by 2+ pronged sales gimmick razors.</li>
    <li> I gotta say i was a bit unsure how good this razor was gonna be but it has an amazing shave to it... make sure you get the razor blades and the soap and stuff though with it too.. besides that it has an extremly close shave and unlike the gilette fusion i the merkur doesnt leave me any razor burn like the fusion did... these razors are a much better choice than the mainstream ones..&#x3D; ima just go put my fusion in the closet.. overall a great product :)</li>
    <li> I have tried so many different shaving methods that I almost gave in and settled for the old Mach 3 stand by.  I researched blogs, reviews on Amazon, and read just anything that I could find information on the best shave with or without cost considered.  I bought this razor over a year ago along with the Merkur platinum blades and can tell you that I have finally found the best shave possible.  I use Taylor of old something or other tub shave soap with a horse hair brush to apply lather.  The shave is close and smooth. Yes, it takes a little longer but I don&#x27;t cut myself any more than I did with a disposable head razor.  The best Braun or Phillips electric can&#x27;t even come close, the Mach 3 and the Fusion do not shave as well and cost a lot more money.  I invested alot of money in a vintage 1949 gillete safety razor with a twist-open top, tried a Merkur with a shorter handle and twist open top, and this particlar old-school razor.  The balance of the handle, the design of the head, and the over-all quality kept bringing me back to it.  I suggest you save alot of time and buy this razor, a set of Merkur blades, some high quality soap and a good real horse-hair brush and toss the rest of your shaving supplies...you won&#x27;t go back.</li>
    <li> Fantastic safety razor!  Great buy for a beginner like me!</li>
    <li> Not to bad a razor as long as you have a sink drain basket. Dropped the top part and had to take apart the plumbing to retrieve it.....</li>
    <li> The razor takes a bit of getting used to when you switch over from a regular Mach 5, but after a week or so, I picked up on how to use it, and I&#x27;m getting extremely close shaves, with no razor burn.  These are also much easier to trim with than one of those Gillette or Schick monstrosities.  Before I got this razor, I did not look forward to shaving.  Now, however, shaving is relaxing and pleasant.  Hot shaving cream and a good shave are great right before going to bed.  Get a Merkur!</li>
    <li> Longer handle fits my hand better than the shorties.  With Astra blades, gives a great shave.</li>
    <li> Great razor for a man! Only so-so for a woman.  My boyfriend loves it but I have some problems with it. It is NOT long handled so don&#x27;t be fooled by the name. Be sure and read the product description. 4\\&quot; is not long if you ask me but that&#x27;s my fault for not being very thorough before buying it.  Secondly the edges of the razor housing (not the blade itself but the outside piece that holds the blade) is VERY sharp on the corners. This doesn&#x27;t seem to be a problem for a mans face but for inward contours like under arms a bikini lines it is really quite painful.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband.  It was highly recommended by a son who loves it. He states that it is the best razor.</li>
    <li> Look, I got tired of throwing away plastic razors, and the clogged heads of two, three and more blades. I actually am old enough to remember safety razors, so I gave this one a shot. It is beautifully made, great feel in the hand, and with a little practice, gives a super shave. Simplicity, quality, and beauty. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Just got this yesterday and it&#x27;s great.  This is my first DE razor and I was expecting a few cuts my first time out.  Great close shave and the only bad experience was a little razor burn, but that is my fault for putting too much pressure on the blade while shaving.  Its only a couple bumps, not really a big deal since it&#x27;s still less razor burn than I would get from a cartridge razor.  My next shave will be perfect, I am sure of it.  Practice makes perfect with this razor.  You need to remember to put just enough pressure to keep the razor on your skin.  Make sure you get a badger brush and a good creme or soap.  You would hack up your face using canned gel or similar products.  I am very happy with this purchase and this razor should theoretically last me the rest of my life.  It has a nice weight to it and you can definitely tell its a quality product.  I bought almost 2 years of razors for the same price as one pack of Gillette fusion cartridges.  A better and cheaper shave, you cant go wrong.</li>
    <li> After months of researching, I decided on this safety razor because of the vast amount of great feedback left. I was not disappointed. I gave away my Gillette Fusion because I am tired of getting ripped off at the store. I am using this razor with Wilkinson Sword safety razor blades from Walmart that are $1.80 for 10 blades. Night and day from the replacements for the Fusion. Stop looking and buy this! You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> came as described, fast delivery</li>
    <li> This razor is amazing and very attractive to boot!&lt;br /&gt;I had another razor purchased from Amazon, a Weishi, but it was all wrong. Unlike that product, this razor has smooth edges all over, perfect for a lady who wishes to shave in small places (don&#x27;t make me explain) where an exposed edge would potentially cut, maim, or cause severe bodily injury...or at the very least catch me off guard. After the other product broke (a couple months after purchase!), I spent the extra few bucks to go with this model. Wish I had done it much, much sooner.&lt;br /&gt;The weight balance is perfect, I do not have to press down on my skin when shaving my legs (as I do at a nearly horizontal angle), and the weight of the razor adds the perfect amount to get the closest shave. I&#x27;ve cut myself exactly one time using this razor, on the knee. It was not even a bad cut.&lt;br /&gt;The razor blade is replaced by unscrewing the handle from the top, which I do by holding the short sides of the razor firmly. It&#x27;s easy and painless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The included razor blade is of unmatched quality. I have used it for a couple months and it is still sharp and not rusted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave is close and accurate. On very densely populated areas (or, very hairy, lol? ew?), I may have to shave twice over with the original blade still in it, but considering the amount of time I&#x27;ve spent using it, that&#x27;s hardly a set back. I&#x27;ve not experienced ingrown hairs or any other problematic symptoms of shaving intimate areas with this razor.&lt;br /&gt;The main reason to buy one of these, though, is for the cost savings. Even with new blades, they cost so much less than the mainstream razor brands it is not even funny! And imagine how much less waste is generated from the use of razors like this, over disposables. I switched over for life and no plans to switch back.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing it is lacking is a razor case for travel. Other than that, perfect, as far as sharp object go!</li>
    <li> Suddenly it is 1969 again and I am watching my dad shave after a long day of work before dinner.&lt;br /&gt;What a great shave! There is no going back to an electric or disposable after a shave with this! Ahhhh!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a brush and shaving soap/cream for many years but always with whatever the latest Gillette was. But I decided to try an old style safety razor instead of what you get at the drug store and this is the one I bought. So far so good. I like the longer length and the weight and balance feel good in your hand as you&#x27;re shaving. Because you have to slow down a little it makes shaving feel like more an event than the Fusion does. I don&#x27;t know if this is good or bad, but for me that&#x27;s the way the way it is. The quality of the razor is also evident.</li>
    <li> Before purchasing this, I was going through a box of 8 Mach3/Fusion/etc cartridges a month, at the cost of $15 or more. The cartridges gave a very poor shave, and it was nearly impossible to get &#x27;close&#x27; without some serious razor burn. Money was not my main focus for buying this, but when you realize you&#x27;re spending $2-4 a cartridge for a mediocre shave, the Merkur becomes much more appealing.    I researched brands and models before settling on this one. There are a number of reasons I like this one versus others, but the most important for me was the longer shaft (at ~3.5). I&#x27;ve tried shorter shafted razors, and found myself really bearing down causing nicks and razor burn. The longer shaft reinforced the need to drag the razor down the face instead of applying excess pressure towards the face. I do need a second stroke against the grain to really get a close shave, but I haven&#x27;t nicked myself on the 180 after a year of use.    In general, the blades are a huge savings over the cartridges that are so prevalent today. Using Merkur blades, the cost is about $0.50 for the same durability as a Fusion cartridge (at least for my case this holds true). The only cost on top of this is oil and soap, but I figure I would be using that anyways. If you&#x27;re on the fence about buying this, it&#x27;s worth it for the closer shave.</li>
    <li> I originally had purchased the Parker 91R razor  and 10 Shark Chrome Blades. It had issues... the blade was not held squarely in the head and corrosion started developing after only two weeks. I returned it and chose the Merkur 180 Long Handled Safety Razor in its place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Merkur 180 has a handle length of 3 7/8\\&quot; which is similar to the Parker 91R. However the handle diameter is not as large as the Parker 91R nor is it as hefty. It weighs about 60 grams vs 82 grams for the Parker. Heft is not really an issue here, I only mention it for comparison purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Merkur has a knurling on the handle that feels \\&quot;sharp\\&quot; for lack of a better word. I notice the difference easily when comparing the feel to the Parker 91R which feels a little bit smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the chrome on the Merkur 180 seems good and the balance of the razor feels good to me. I&#x27;ve tried a couple blades in it and they all have been absolutely square in the head whereas in the Parker, the blades were slightly off resulting in an uneven shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I feel that the Merkur is superior in construction and quality compared to the Parker 91R. The shave with the Merkur is not as \\&quot;aggressive\\&quot; as that of the Parker 91R. This could be reassuring to those who are new to the double-edge shaving scene but could also be a reason for a more experienced DE shaver to want a razor that has a more aggressive shaving action. I prefer the feel of the Merkur during shaving but this is a personal choice.</li>
    <li> Shaving has become more enjoyable and less of a chore. I&#x27;ve switched over to this from using cartridges since I started shaving and it&#x27;s the closest shave I&#x27;ve had so far. If you have very sensitive skin like me then do yourself and your skin the favor and switch. It&#x27;s way less irritation.  You do not need 5 blades to do the job of just 1 razor.</li>
    <li> Superior than the crap you see advertised on t.v. and magazines.  Seriously, how did these fall out of favor?  It has great weight to it and very easy to replace the blade.  I have yet to knick myself; it has great tactile feedback.  My wife has taken to it as well.  I feel like a fool for having used and wasted so much money on popular brands.</li>
    <li> There are a lot of great reviews for this razor so I&#x27;ll try to make this as brief and practical as possible.  This is an outstanding razor.  The shaving experience is much more enjoyable and ridiculously close.      A few notes - I switched from a Gillette Mach 3 and if you are switching to a safety razor for the first time then I highly recommend that you invest in a quality shaving soap or cream. Don&#x27;t bother buying this razor if you are going to use a standard foam or gel.  I&#x27;ve tried cans and cream w/ shaving brush and there is a stark difference.  The can is fine in a pinch, but the blade will not glide on your skin and you are more likely to cut or nick yourself.      Also, you cannot shave with this razor in the same way you would shave with a conventional blade.  Don&#x27;t press or force it.  Make sure you dry it after each use.  Finally - I&#x27;ve used Merkur blades and Israeli blades and found both to be very effective...    It&#x27;s really hard to believe the difference.  I went from shaving every other day because I hated the experience to not having to shave every day because the shave is so close (but I do anyway b/c this thing is just fun...).</li>
    <li> High quality with nice weight to it. Has been my go-to razor since I purchased and will not be looking back.</li>
    <li> Have been using this razor for several months now and it has already paid for itself a couple of times vs the cartridge (3 blade) razor that it replaced.  The cost of those replacement blades was ridiculous and they didn&#x27;t give me a closer shave.    Other reviewers have said that the long handle isn&#x27;t really that long... just longer than the standard handle Merkur razor.  They are right. The handle on this is about the length of a typical razor you find in the store.  The other is a full inch shorter than this one so I can&#x27;t imagine shaving with it. Maybe if you have small hands.    In order to get a decent shave on my old razor I had to make several strokes.  The same is true with this one.  My shaving time is probably just slightly faster with this razor since it is so easy to clean.  I also haven&#x27;t had one case of razor burn with this razor using Derby blades.    The final result for me has been a slightly closer shave for a lot less money.  If I want an even better shave I take the time to use a good quality shaving soap which you have to foam up and apply with a shaving brush.  For day to day shaving, however, I still use cheap foam from a can and the results are good enough.    I haven&#x27;t figured out how people who cut themselves are doing it.  I get fewer nicks with this than any razor I&#x27;ve had in the past.  My only guess is that they are pressing too hard.  Tip: Don&#x27;t press a sharp piece of stainless steal hard into your skin.      The other complaints I have seen tend to be from not learning how to use the razor. Unlike the disposable with a floating head you have to hold it at the right angle so the razor contacts your beard/skin.  If the handle is parallel to the skin you are shaving you are holding it wrong.  It definitely is not hard to do but may take some people a bit of practice.  My tip is to listen for the difference while shaving an area near your ear.    I can&#x27;t think of any reason I would go back to the cartridge razor they carry in the store.  Iget a better shave with no more time/effort and at around $0.25 per blade after shipping.  (vs as much as $3-$4 per blade.)    One place this razor really shines is when shaving thick or longer beards.  I let my beard grow in every now and then and shave it down when I get tired of it.  The cartridge razor would clog up repeatedly and I&#x27;d have to clean it.  That is despite trimming most of the beard off with an electric razor first.  Last time I shaved off my beard I used this razor and didn&#x27;t even need to pre-cut it first. I had a fresh blade in it and it lathered up good.  I was able to get a clean shave without clogging it once.  I&#x27;d estimate it took me 1/2 the time it used to.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great razor. I like the long handle, however, I don&#x27;t like taking the head apart to change blades.</li>
    <li> Will never look back. Don&#x27;t stay on the Gillette bandwagon, and shave like a gentleman. Much less irritation, and you&#x27;ll save so much money on razors.</li>
    <li> This razor provided me with a good shave for the 5 months that I had it. To look at it, the razor seems very sturdy, just 3 peaces of metal that screw together. I was quite surprised today when it fell in the shower and broke. The top piece, which screws into the handle, broke. Specifically the screw part fell out. I had assumed this was all one piece, but it appears to be glued together. Overall this razor would be good, but for the money I need something that will last more than 5 months, even if I drop it.</li>
    <li> Wish I had start using this razor a long time ago!  This will last me a lifetime.</li>
    <li> Like everyone says this razor is hands down my favorite! I cant believe i was suckered into buying other shavers with 3,4 blades or an Electric Shaver. This razor gives you the closest shave hands down and for the value you cant beat it. If you take your time and you use slow strokes you will enjoy your shaving experience. I threw out all my other Gillete razors in the garbage. This thing is built like a tank. And I expect many many many years of shaving with this Razor. Dont even read more reviews just buy the thing already. :)</li>
    <li> took some getting used to but love it now.</li>
    <li> No irritation, was scared to try of cutting myself. Just read don&#x27;t apply pressure and go with the grain. Best shaving ever hands down</li>
    <li> very satisfied with this purchase</li>
    <li> Very good razor but the butterfly razors change blades easier</li>
    <li> I was apprehensive at the thought of a safety razor.  My husband purchased one about a month before. I used it and I was hooked.  Such a close shave and if you rinse it out each time, NO razor burn! It is good for bikini area, underarms and legs.  The long handle makes it perfect for the long reach of shaving your legs.</li>
    <li> Best razor you can buy.  Quit waisting money on disposable razors.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving for just over 10 years now, so I started with the good old Gillette Sensor Excel.  Switched over to the Mach3, then Mach3 Turbo, M3 Power, Fusion and finally Fusion Power.  In that time, I had also tried 2 Schick razors, with limited success.  Clearly, I had always been drawn towards Gillette and it&#x27;s ever \\&quot;improving\\&quot; technology.  I did enjoy the shaves (i.e. the closeness/smoothness) I got with my Fusion, and even my Mach3s for that matter, but what I hated was the irritation, or razor burn, that I would suffer with for the next day or two.  Though smooth, was face always had an irritated feel.  I just assumed that this was normal, as I was shaving using the proper technique, and was not driven to do anything about it.  On a search for a nicer, classier, version of the Mach3 or Fusion, I came across an article about Double Edged razors and decided to research further.  It eventually led me to the Merkur razors, which I had read some reviews about, as being good razors.  After some reading about the technique and products required, I decided to make the investment, and I must say, I was/am impressed!    I decided to purchase the Long handled version, along with 100 Derby blades and a badger hair brush.  I already have a decent aftershave, which I will continue to use.  After watching some youtube videos by mantic59, I decided to try it out.  The first couple of shaves were a bit rough, with some nicks and, I must say, some razor burn.  What I realized, however, was that the cuts were being caused by my habitual pressure application, that is, I was applying too much pressure, as I was used to doing with the Gillette cartridge based razors.  You don&#x27;t have to apply any pressure with this razor, as the weight of the razor applies enough pressure for the shave.  The razor burn, on the other hand, was a result of taking multiple strokes on a single lathering.  This was easily corrected.  The difference with these razors being, you can&#x27;t expect to get all the hair in a single stroke.  Take your time, as it will pay off in the end.    I&#x27;ve only been shaving with the Merkur for about 3 weeks now, and I am loving it! The lathering part is fun, I must say, and quite relaxing.  Some say that it takes too long to shave, and I won&#x27;t lie, it does take longer than a Mach3, but the shave is more enjoyable.  Plus, it forces you to slow things down a bit, in an otherwise rushed day, which can be very relaxing.  My face feels cleaner as well, probably because I&#x27;m using shaving soap (in my case Proraso), instead of the usual shaving gel \\&quot;goop\\&quot; from a can.  No more irritation!  I can even shave the next day, if I want to, which I couldn&#x27;t do before.  Definitely a good choice for a beginner.  Just remember to take it slow and easy.</li>
    <li> Nice product, a blast from the past. Forgot what a &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; shave is all about!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been collecting knives for several years now.  My curiosity of steels, grinds, heat treatment and such eventually led me to look into the world of shaving.  Let me tell you, there&#x27;s a lot to take in.    As someone who has only used the traditional Gillette Mach 3 razors, I found it intimidating to jump right into straight edge shaving.  Not only is there greater chance of a serious accident with a straight edge razor, there is also the question of maintenance - you have to learn how to sharpen and strop free hand.  I also have found that straight edge razors are far more expensive than I originally believed them to be.    In steps the safety razor.  I remember my dad using one when I was little, so you can say nostalgia helped push me along this route.  The cheaper investment cost and smaller chance of a serious injury drew my attention as well.  Merkur is widely touted as one of the top options for a safety razor and after purchasing the 180, I can confidently say that all of my expectations have been met.    The razor has a great chrome finish, something you rarely see nowadays.  It has a good weight to it as well.  The fact that you can buy 10 razors (which equals roughly 50 shaves) is very nice.  The biggest thing is technique, which only comes with practice.  Lathering with bar soap is a bit more time consuming but is actually quite enjoyable.  The precise shave with a safety razor is awesome (especially when getting at those pesky hairs under the nose).  It&#x27;s also nice to rinse your face and apply a nice aftershave.    It all comes down to what you want from a shave.  If you are fine with learning some new techniques, and accepting the learning curve, then you will enjoy a safety razor.  If you are unsure which razor to pick, you can&#x27;t go wrong with the 180.  I have no complaints and this is my first, and only, safety razor.  It works so well that I have no real urge to pick up any different models (yet, anyway).  Remember, short strokes and take your time.</li>
    <li> This is a quality razor.  I also own and use a Merkur Futur.  I purchased this to use as a travel razor and I was really surprised that it gave as good a shave as the Futur and only cost about half as much.  I liked it so much, I ordered one for one of my sons.</li>
    <li> I love it. Came recomended by the shaving101 guys. Head is heavy and stays nice and warm.</li>
    <li> This is my first ever safety razor, so I don&#x27;t have a lot to compare it to. I went with a Merkur because of recommendations that I read on a few different sites while doing research on safety razors. I was not disappointed with my decision. I would gladly recommend this razor as a first safety razor for any safety razor shaving newbie.</li>
    <li> Started using a double-edge safety razor at age 56 and enjoy shaving with this model. I would be curious on how the one without a guard works. I don&#x27;t find that I have to &#x27;kid-glove&#x27; it too much in order to prevent nicking. Very easy to use.</li>
    <li> Got tired of the mach 3 prices and irritation so finally took the jump into DE wet shaving. There is definitely a learning curve, so read up before you get into it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, as for this specific razor, it is well made. There isn&#x27;t a whole lot that can go wrong with these, they are quite simple. The only thing that kept me from giving this 5 stars for the most part is the knurling on the handle. I&#x27;d prefer it to be a bit deeper, when it&#x27;s wet it can be a little slippery. It surely would not stop me from buying it again though, just a slight annoyance. Being a machinist has made me a bit picky on metal working, so I&#x27;d do it a bit different if I were doing it myself. Aside from the knurling, the threads that hold the head on are just a tiny bit loose for my preference. Again, it doesn&#x27;t affect the product in use what-so-ever, just a slight quality issue that most people probably wouldn&#x27;t notice, but is worth pointing out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used any other DE razors to compare it to, but it seems like it&#x27;s not too aggressive, but it can definitely cause some irritation if you don&#x27;t have your technique just right. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good balance for someone just getting into DE shaving, but again, I don&#x27;t really have much to compare it to. With patience and really paying attention to not using any pressure, I was able to get a very acceptable shave with no irritation. I let my guard down on my second shave and got some decent razor burn...woops!</li>
    <li> I did not like this at all. It was very rough and irritated my skin. I returned it after only a couple of shaves.</li>
    <li> My husband still has to go over with a disposable for his beard</li>
    <li> Razor works great! This style of razor saves a lot of money using double edge razor blades instead of the ridiculously expensive new ones.</li>
    <li> Finally ditched the Mach 3 Turbo when I went to Walmart and saw the cartridges went up to almost $35 for 10. Rediculous especially when I get ingrown hairs from them. First shave with this bad boy and I couldn&#x27;t even tell my my hairs were being cut. No pull or snag what so ever. Haven&#x27;t had an ingrown hair or razor bump yet. Love it. Plus it looks bad ass in my stand with my badger brush and soap bowl.</li>
    <li> nostalgia was my initial hook.  my beloved grandfather used a butterfly double edge, which i always thougt cool.  when i found this, i was quick to give it a try.  within a couple of shaves, i had gotten used to the difference from shaving with a disposable.  i am thrilled with this razor and blades (I bought the Merkur).  as others have stated, this is actually an enjoyable part of the day.  requires only a very light touch and leaves a great fresh feeling.  An added benefit, a Gillette Fusion blade costs $3 per blade and a Merkur costs $.70.  assuming a blade per week, this is an annual savings of $120.  why did we ever go to disposables?  as for cream, i am still loyal to Noxema Aloe, rather than the soap and brush - to each his own.</li>
    <li> Great razor. The long handle makes it easy for my big hands to handle. This razor is easy to rinse out, and never gets plug up with hair. I can shave every day, or once a week, and still get a great shave.</li>
    <li> This is a nice sturdy razor with some heft to it.  You shouldn&#x27;t have any problems with it getting cuts as long as you remember to treat it gently. There is NO need to push. Simply dragging it along your face will get the job done.</li>
    <li> I am beyond satisfied with this razor.  I cannot believe the quality of shave that I have with it.  Now let me be clear that I have used it only once.  This morning was the first time I have ever used a DE Safety Razor from Merkur and I am confident that I will never go back to the disposable cartridge style again.</li>
    <li> The Merkur Model 180 is an excellent razor. As a disclaimer I and new to the world of DE razor shaving and it has been an excellent and comfortable introduction. I have been shaving with it every day for over a week now with no cuts, razor burn, or discomfort in use. The sample Merkur blade is came with was excellent as well, it lasted 6 days before it needed to be replaced. I recommend this product to anyone just starting out.</li>
    <li> I have had this razor for a couple years and now it&#x27;s broken. I wasn&#x27;t extremely hard on it... How can you be hard on a razor... Any way, it was great until it broke. I&#x27;m very disappointed with the product.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this razor for my significant other. She wanted to start shaving her legs with DE razor after seeing me get very nice shaves for mere cents per DE blade. Before I gave it to her, I tried it myself first. I use 178 model (same thing, shorter handle). Turns out I was right in getting the shorter handle model for shaving my face. This long handle was just too much in the way of adjusting for shaving angles. Don&#x27;t get me wrong -- this is still an awesome razor, but for shaving beards I think the shorter handle is better!    This razor works wonderfully for shaving body hair. A regular multiblade clogs up almost immediately and you have to rinse and rinse and even carefully dig the hair out with your fingers. Not so for this razor! First of all, even clogged, it keeps on cutting. And when things get too clogged, just slightly untwist it, and hair rinses right out! This razor also cuts body hair in a *single pass*, unlike the latest multiblade mutations.</li>
    <li> I am totally disappointed with this product. They sent me a rusty handle, and the shave was not even close to my expectation. I have used similar kind of handle few years ago and the experience was much better. This product is really overpriced and I wouldnt recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Having tried the shorter Merkur razor, I decided I needed a longer handle. This one is about 4 inches and allows me to hold and control the razor very well. Just what I needed.</li>
    <li> Fantastic!  Irritates my skin much less than the new style razors!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just FYI: This model comes apart into 3 pieces.</li>
    <li> by now i have already used razors like gillette 2 blades, excel, mach 3, fusion, and fusion pro glide. I bought this item thinking that it would give me a better shave. well after using this razor i can&#x27;t really say anything bad about all the razors i have mentioned above. first off on my first shave i cut myself really bad. nicks here nicks there..awful. since i was new to this wet shaving i admit that i didn&#x27;t know how to hold the razor. then on my second shave i learned a lot from youtube videos on how to shave with a safety razor and still cut myself, less but i got razor burn. so i said one more shave and that would be it and i might just go back to the proglide. for my third shave i even learned a method on how to hold the razor at the base so i apply the proper pressure and just let the blade glide through my skin and it worked but still got nicks on my chin and neck. PLUS with this razor you have to take at least double the time you take with any normal disposable razor. so i concluded that;  first: i&#x27;m returning this item already  second: like i already said after using this razor I can&#x27;t really say anything bad about any disposable razor. they will all give you a close shave so just continue using whatever you have (mach 3, fusion, proglide, excel, etc.)  bottom line: this safety razor compared to any other disposable razor (like the fusion) is like comparing a transmission manual car (safety razor) to an automatic car (disposable) both will get you there but one requieres more work, and if you don&#x27;t know how to shift the gears you will be on trouble, meaning if you don&#x27;t know how to use this safety razor you will cut yourself really bad and get razor burn.    pro: it&#x27;s well made and looks really good on your bathroom</li>
    <li> Great razor still getting the hang of it but works really well. Also we&#x27;ll constructed</li>
    <li> This is such an outstanding product. I have finally jettisoned the disposable junk from Gillette, and I am shaving for a fraction of the cost now thanks to this Merkur razor. The design is so basic and easy to use and keep clean (just three pieces). I am glad I got the longer handled razor as I can&#x27;t imagine how I would handle the shorter one. I use Wilkinson blades since they are the only decent double edge blades I can purchase locally, and they work great. It takes me no more time to shave with this than it did with my Gillette Mach 3, and yet I get a noticeably closer shave.</li>
    <li> Looking for a new shaver? Go no further. This feels great in your hand. Well balanced, no moving parts to break and glides well along my face. I get multiple uses out of just one blade. Gone are the days of those cartridge razors that dull easy and are way to expensive and gave me small cuts.  With this type of razor you need to use shaving creme. This razor comes in three parts and is easy to break down. It travels well and gives me a close shave.  I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to save money.  It&#x27;s also good for beginners too.</li>
    <li> She&#x27;s a beaut.  Get compliments from guests on the simple class of this razor.  Oh, it also shaves great with my derby razors.  Like I&#x27;ve said before, I&#x27;m not terribly well versed in wet shaving, but this razor does the trick for me.</li>
    <li> Shave like your father (grandfather?) did, they might say.  Well, I tried using this decently well-made razor and I must say I&#x27;m disappointed.  The shave the Merkur delivers just isn&#x27;t as close as I&#x27;ve come to expect from the various Schick triple blade razors (e.g. Mach 3).  Also, changing the double edged blade is rather more difficult than I expected, as the whole top of the razor detaches, leaving one with a wet-handed reassembly job to do.  On the plus side, the Personna blades are very inexpensive, making the cost/shave very reasonable.  IMHO, shaving with a DE razor is something one might try, but be prepared to find that the old ways aren&#x27;t necessarily the better ways.</li>
    <li> I would like to highly recommend the Merkur Model 180 Safety Razor. I recently had a visit at my dermatologist discovering the thing on my face was an ingrown hair. She asked what razor I was using, well of course the Triple bladed bells and whistle Excel 2525 (you know what I mean).  She informed me how bad those razors are for your face and told me to switch to a single blade brand. I decided to research a good safety razor.  I like most had flash backs of the day my father taught me shaving with a safety razor. It was recorded on 8mm film and made it into the movies under the name Blood hotel.  I did however place the order recalling how dad swore by it. This razor gives a remarkable shave in addition to being a piece of art. For once there will be something in the bathroom that you not the wife can be proud of. I park it on a glass shelf with an English shaving brush, outstanding.  When you purchase the Merkur add Feather hi Stainless Platinum blades to the order. They have the proper sharpness and flex for those starting out again. Last my tips for a great shave. Like all meticulous tasks take your time but go in orderly fashion. 1. Hot wet towel to the face 2. A good foamy shave cream like Rise Super foam lather, apply a moderately good portion warmed up under hot water 2 seconds than directly to beard. 3. Now guide your Merkur no applied pressure letting the weight of the razor do the work. 4. Rinse the blade frequently. You will feel like Joe Namath with blondes all around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001G5HZCY Feather Hi-Stainless Platinum Double Edge Razor Blades 30 Ct]]</li>
    <li> Fantastic razor, make sure that the ribbed bottom piece is facing upward, otherwise the blade won&#x27;t work!</li>
    <li> It took me a few tries to master the use of this razor, but it really does give me a better shave than the fusion or mach 3.  The other reviews are correct, you really do need to take your time.  But I also feel as if I enjoy shaving more now that it is sort of a learned technique! The razor costs some money up front, but at $4.99 for a 10 pack of razors at the supermarket it sure beats the $12-15.00 mach 3 and fusion replacements.  Excellent product!</li>
    <li> I was born in the fifties and therefore grew up shaving my legs and underarms with a double-edged razor. When the disposable multiple-blade razors came out, I&#x27;d just moved off to college and lost my other razor and so just switched. But over the years, I got increasingly more and more disgusted with shaving&amp;mdash;the hair on my legs is coarse and dark&amp;mdash;even to the point of not shaving at all if I didn&#x27;t absolutely have to. Tried epilators and hated them. Tried melting my hair off with noxious creams&amp;mdash;NO! Went ape-woman for years when it was the &amp;#34;hippie&amp;#34; thing to do and also after a later-life divorce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I decided maybe it wasn&#x27;t the shaving itself I hated but the razors I was using. The way the five-blade ones get all jammed up with scum and hair. The absurd cost. The major unpleasantness of the cheaper alternatives. Not to mention all that plastic going into the landfills and Great Pacific Garbage Patch. So I got this Merkur razor and a box of a hundred Astra blades, figuring that would probably last me the rest of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Merkur long-handled razor is a beauty. It shaves very close without any tugging, and I&#x27;ve only cut myself once when I wasn&#x27;t paying attention and got a little too aggressive like I used to have to with the disposable razors. (I don&#x27;t know how other blades would compare, but I&#x27;m happy with the Astras. I used to always double-shave, even with my old double-edged razor and Gillette blades in my teens, but I really don&#x27;t have to now.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give this razor five stars if the handle grip actually was easier to hold onto without slipping. I shave in the tub, dipping the razor into the water to clear the blade periodically, and I find the wet handle is difficult to hold onto to keep the head from rotating out of position while shaving. My hands are pretty big-boned and large for a woman, so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s small hands. I wish now I&#x27;d gotten a razor with a rubberized grip, and I&#x27;ll be looking for something I can use as a sleeve for this razor so I&#x27;ll feel more secure in using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I do with this razor sometimes is use an herbal hair conditioner as a shaving lotion so I can shave without water. Water is precious, and we need to be conserving it as much as we can, especially in areas where drought is a problem. The Merkur razor glides smoothly on my &amp;#34;conditioned&amp;#34; legs, cutting closely and without any burn, and I can rinse the head in a small cup of water after each few strokes. This works great if I need a quick shave but don&#x27;t want to waste water.g for something I can use as a sleeve for this razor so I&#x27;ll feel more secure in using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I do with this razor sometimes is use an herbal hair conditioner as a shaving lotion so I can shave without water.

    <li> I&#x27;ve had a Merkur Long Classic now for more than 4 years.  I was a convert from electric shavers (which I had used since my teens).  I went on my honeymoon and forgot my electric shaver.  As a resort, I went to the grocery and picked up a cheapo plastic razor and some cheap shaving cream...  And I was really impressed.  Eventually, I tried to find out if other products were better.  I was faced with replacing the microfoil on my electric, and decided to go the wet-shave route.  Prices on big-name products really discouraged me.  I couldn&#x27;t see myself spending all that money on those 2, 4, even 5 blade Gillette and Schick products.    I did a bit of research and found that old-fashioned wet-shavers often preferred the traditional (original) Gilette-styled razor that you see here. Until I researched it, I never know that such products were still used, and I especially had never considered that there are so many fantastic shaving creams and brushes out there as well (though not in your local supermarket).    There is a small learning curve to using this product.  You don&#x27;t \\&quot;rake\\&quot; your face like you&#x27;re whipping around a Mach-5.  Wash your face, use plenty of water, lather up a quality soap or cream with a handmade badger brush, and shave in a way that makes in enjoyable - not just some daily chore.  You&#x27;ll be amazed at how a quality shaving cream is an eye-opener in the morning, and how a quality razor can give you a shave that&#x27;s almost as close as a straight razor with no irritation.    You can buy replacement blades for as little as $1-$2 for 5 packs from your grocery, or order other brands online that might match your beard type.  Everyone&#x27;s face and beard are different.  I buy my blades in bulk-packs of 100 for for fractions of what you&#x27;d pay for the 5-blade store brands, and I get a perfect shave every time.  Try a few different brands of blades and I am sure that you&#x27;ll find one that is perfect for you.</li>
    <li> I first purchased the short-handled version but thought it was much too short to get a good grip with, so I returned it for this model.  The long handle is much easier to hold and use.  Works great.  Edit:  after 21 months the part where it screws in broke off.  Iv&#x27;e heard these things last decades, but that was clearly not the case.</li>
    <li> After 18 years of shaving, I&#x27;ve finally found a razor that gives me a good shave without overly irritating my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Up until now, I&#x27;ve always used the hyped-up multi-blade plastic cartridge razors you frequently see ads for on television. But they&#x27;ve never really done a great job. There have always been a few spots on my face that don&#x27;t quite get a smooth as I would like. I could get a pretty good shave by stretching my face around and using pressure in certain places. But even when I just did a quick shave, not only was it a pretty spotty job, but the cartridge razors left my face very irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received my Merkur razor from Amazon about three weeks ago, and my first impression was very good. It felt great in my hand just taking it out of the box. The heft and weight of the razor are really impressive. The quality manufacturing really stands out, particularly when compared to the chincy plastic things I&#x27;m accustomed to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paired my purchase with some Derby Extra blades, and I&#x27;ve been quite pleased. Although it took me one or two shaves to get the hang of using this type of razor, now that I have I&#x27;m getting very close shave without any silly face stretching and with very little irritation. And using it feels a lot more manly than the plastic toys most of us are used to, for whatever that&#x27;s worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a thinner, fairly soft beard and quite sensitive skin. Your mileage may vary!</li>
    <li> Why did I wait so long.......</li>
    <li> shiny, smooth, and heavy...a perfect match and well-balanced.</li>
    <li> Like many folks, the mere nostalgia of these types of razors makes me happy and the look of this one which was all I could do with it over the internet was and is in real life what I like.  I&#x27;m very happy with the weight, grip, and handle length.  The price was right too. The weight is somewhat heavy, but I like that and in order for a razor to do its work it needs to be about the weight of the Merkur 180.  A lighter razor would force you to place too much force against the skin and increase the chances of irritation and cuts.  If used properly with a good blade appropriate for your skin (I like the Shark Chrome) then you should experience little if any problems.</li>
    <li> Small learning curve but totally worth it once mastered. Good quality, looking forward to having it for years. Get the same shave for a fraction of the cost.</li>
    <li> This is my first safety razor and, at first, I was sorely disappointed. I used this, the Proraso Shaving Soap, and the Escali Shaving Brush. I nicked my face all over and couldn&#x27;t get the blade to glide smoothly across my face. After a few days I decided to shave a small area on my neck with my regular shaving cream, in a can (that can is dead to me now). The blade worked perfectly and I got a nice clean shave. Turns out that I didn&#x27;t know how to create a proper lather with the Proraso Soap and execute proper angle with the blade.&lt;br /&gt;If it didn&#x27;t work for you the first time around, pay close attention to the contours of your face, the direction of your hair growth, and use short light passes, letting the blade do the work. Make sure to stretch your skin in difficult areas and I am sure you will be very pleased with this product. Watching a few videos on youtube will help too.</li>
    <li> I have super sensitive skin &amp; have to be careful how often I shave. I was sick of spending a bunch of money on blades and with my skin, I really could only shave once a week. Which is not great when it is summertime. I&#x27;ve been fairly happy with this razor. You do need to go a bit slower, but it is a much closer shave then my old razor (the Venus one). With this razor if I shave the night before, my legs are still smooth the next day! I just use a nice olive oil soap to shave and so far no bumps.</li>
    <li> Product works very well. 5 stars. My guy loves it. He&#x27;s African American, suffers from ingrown hair. He could only shave once a week. I hated it!! But since I bought him the Merkur Model 180, he&#x27;s been shaving everyday. I love it!! But be sure to use a razor bump stopper shaving cream or after shave. I got him the Tend Skin. Works great. All in all, I highly recommend this single edge razor for any African American men with ingrown hair.</li>
    <li> I love the longer handle, the balance during shaving is perfect. I purchased some &amp;#34;fits all double edge razor&amp;#34; blades from the grocery, looks like they will fit fine. I was skeptical regarding the lack of &amp;#34;opening doors&amp;#34; to put in the blade. With this razor, the head unscrews, the cap plate comes off, replace the blade, put the cap plate back on (the correct direction, of course!) then while holding the bladehead by the ends, screw the handle back on. That&#x27;s going to take some getting used to. I&#x27;ve had it three days, and I&#x27;m happy so far!!</li>
    <li> This is nice and well done product, shave nicely, holds perfectly, it takes little time to get used to, but you can improve the skills. It is necessary to have quality shave cream or foam. I may recommend different blade, not sure if there is better than these in the package, but they could be a little sharper. But overall, it is solid and cool shaver gadget.</li>
    <li> This was the first DE razor I purchased. I&#x27;m a big guy and I thought that the 180 Long Handle would be a perfect match for my hands, but it wasn&#x27;t. Just shaving for the first time with the Merkur Model 180 DE razor I instinctively knew that razor didn&#x27;t feel right in my hands. I went ahead and purchased the Merkur Heavy Duty Double Edge Razor #34C , a lot smaller than the 180, but it felt perfect in my big hands. I felt like I had more control over the razor. I purchased the 180 because it was pushed onto me by Amazon, meaning when you purchase, e.g. a shaving brush, Amazon has a section that says \\&quot;Frequently Bought Together.\\&quot; Since at the time I was new to DE Razor I figured it must be a great razor, which I am sure it is, but just not for me.</li>
    <li> good value, excellent quality, good result from intended usage.  i would recommend unequivocally.</li>
    <li> Love this razor, nice blance, easy to clean and sturdy.</li>
    <li> I really can&#x27;t add anything to this product that hasn&#x27;t been said already by the hundreds of reviews on here already. But this is my experience:     I, too, feel like razor blade cartridges are entirely too expensive. I can save hundreds and hundreds of dollars using a safety razor and disposable blades.     When my Merkur arrived, the package was opened with much enthusiasm. One of the first things I noticed was that it did NOT have the butterfly head. From lack of investigation, I thought it would have the butterfly head. Disappointment began to seep in. The razor as a whole didn&#x27;t feel like it had much weight to it either, more heft was expected. Sigh...but then I really began to inspect this thing. I noticed when looking at this razor from the side, there is a huge canyon of space for your hairs and shaving soap/cream to stow away into. I had so much trouble with disposable razor cartridges getting my beard hairs stuck between the blades, reducing or eliminating altogether its cutting duty. I know without a doubt that my Merkur will NOT EVER clog up with hair and shaving cream/soap. Reading other reviewers informed me that having the butterfly-type head isn&#x27;t all it&#x27;s cracked up to be, and can be difficult to clean. When I placed the blade in the head and tightened everything down, the blade sits perfectly straight.....but I was still wishing the unit as a whole was heavier.     Upon my first shave, I must say the weight is actually spot-on. I feel like if it were heavier, it would be out of balance. Maneuverability was effortless. Likely, if it were heavier, my mind would be experiencing that weight rather than paying attention to my shaving!     I feel like I accidentally picked out the best safety razor I could have! Highly recommend this product.    Thanks to all of the Amazon.com reviewers out there that help everyone make informed decisions!</li>
    <li> German engineering cannot be beat!</li>
    <li> Why did I wait so long to try this. First I want to say that the quality of this razor is excellent. It is very solid material. I would expect it to last 20+ years.  I use this razor to shave my legs, arm pits, and other girl parts. So far I&#x27;ve never cut myself and the shave is much closer. Which makes it so I have to shave less often. Another plus. Just go slow the first few times and you&#x27;ll love it. The blades are soooo cheap which is another plus. I bought 100 count for the same price as 5 of my old razor.</li>
    <li> I am a first time DE razor user. Before I purchased this item I did quite a bit of reading on-line as to what DE razor would be a good one for first time users such as me. The Merkur name always came up in the top three of all the razors I read about. This model has the high number of positive reviews here for good reason. It is absolutely great!    I am impressed by the precision construction of this instrument and its very fine finish. I found no rough edges. Everything is polished well. Where the razor makes contact with the skin is polished to a smooth mirror finish. The craftsmanship of this instrument is simply excellent. That alone sells me on this product.    The weight of this razor is not terribly heavy. In fact, I can see why this particular razor is highly recommended as the one for first time DE shavers, since it has the size of a good cartridge razor, and isn&#x27;t too much heavier. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this definitely is heavier than a good quality cartridge razor, but this Merkur model makes the switch over to DE shaving a snap. After my first shave I won&#x27;t be turning back to my cartridge razor again! I am sold.    I had my very first DE shave with this and it practically shaves your face for you. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this Merkur.</li>
    <li> I read all the glowing reviews and thought \\&quot;I gotta get one of those!\\&quot;. I did. It gives an OK shave.  However, I prefer the shave I get with my Parker 96 Butterfly razor. I guess shaving is a very individual matter.</li>
    <li> I just received my Merkur 180 for my birthday and I&#x27;m really impressed!  It shaves as well as any of those triple or quadruple blade razors.  Yes, you have to take your time with this tool, which some might see as a disadvantage, but I like having to make the time to take genuine care of my face.  I have sensitive skin and this razor is going to help me prevent breakouts on my neck.  This is a very good buy and a great gift!</li>
    <li> Overall it is a very well made razor.  The weight feels nice and the handle has a good length to it.  I&#x27;m not a fan of the method to replace the blades (you have to unscrew the whole top piece and blade from the handle as opposed to just unscrewing the bottom of the handle).  Also the handle is pretty thin so it can get uncomfortable to hold for long periods of time.  I would recommend getting a heavy duty Merkur razor as the handles are thicker and the blade replacement method is more convenient.</li>
    <li> The long handle Merkur is the one to get; it&#x27;s much easier to control than the standard stubby length.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally care for shaving.  Never had.  As long as I can get away with it, and so long as stuff doesn&#x27;t get too itchy, I let it grow.  I even grew out the chops and goatee not JUST as a fashion choice but because it cut the area of face I have to drag a sharp object over by 60%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS however is completely different.  I love it.  It is a closer, more satisfying shave and has become a new meditative ritual I can look forward too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before using a safety razor, do a little research because it is different and if you aren&#x27;t careful you are going to butcher yourself.</li>
    <li> Bought this razor after my brother purchased it, and swore by it.  I have really enjoyed switching from electric shavers/disposable shavers to a safety razor.  You cannot even believe the world of difference in shaving with a safety razor.  I feel this is a very affordable quality razor for beginner safety razor shavers.  There are more expensive premium safety razors out there, but this is great for beginners.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually(ever) write reviews, but just had to.  I have kept a goatee for many(20)years, not because I like it, but because I have ridiculously sensitive skin along with dermatitis and a heavy beard.  Wonderful combo.  So no harsh soaps, nothing with alcohol, etc, and when I shave, I get one shot.  If I have to go over it again, I basically turn purple.  I would burn through a Mach3, and a Fusion, Hydro, in 1-2 shots. tried them all.  The other option was to just leave the goatee which I was long tired of. So, upon further research, I stumbled upon a thread about going back to old school shaving.    Who&#x27;da thunk, but goddam what a difference.  I never thought I would be so happy about a shave.  I ordered up this puppy, bought myself shaving soap for sensitive skin, styptic pencil.. prepped my face and basically just went for it.  I did this at night before I went to bed, because whenever I did a full shave in the past, I needed at least a day for the red to go down.  Lets just say its friggen great!    I went slow, I didn&#x27;t slice my head off, little bit of pressure and voila,, a sink full o&#x27; stubble.  Small redness, but that&#x27;s more because it has been several months since my last clean shave.  Two small nicks that are hardly worth mentioning.  No flair up, etc.  I love it. And not dropping 3-4-5 bucks a pop for a razor is sweet.  Feathers blades,, cheap and sharp.  Nivea face balm for super sensitive skin.    Thats all.  Try it, you may like it.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things.</li>
    <li> Without a doubt, the closest shave ever. Takes a little more time but it is worth the effort.&lt;br /&gt;With a mach 3 or similar you can both see and feel the remaining hair, even when going over the same area multiple times.&lt;br /&gt;With the Merkur 180 you can brush your hand against the grain of your beard growth and feel nothing at all....pure smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Build quality excellent, no chrome issues.&lt;br /&gt;- Bought with a 25 pack of blades (variety) to see which one suits me best.&lt;br /&gt;- Using Prorasso tube shaving cream, also working well.&lt;br /&gt;- Nivea non-alcohol/dye post shave balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a newbie to the world of DE razors. Bought this after reading other reviews. Really like it.Able to get a close and clean shave.</li>
    <li> If i remember I think my Dad use to use one of the when I was 7 or so.(40 years ago) I really like the CO Bigelow saving cream so when I went to order, Amazon said that customer also bought this razor, and it had a lot of good and high reviews, so I said I&#x27;ll give it a try.&lt;br /&gt; All I can say is WOW! I&#x27;m not sure why these lost popularity back in the day. Used with a good shaving cream I can get a better shave than with The Gillette Mark 4 or 5 or whatever it is now.&lt;br /&gt;  I was a little timid with my first 2 shaves about cutting myself, but after that I can get a real close shave rather quickly with no nicks. In fact I haven&#x27;t nicked myself any!&lt;br /&gt; I also bought Feather Hi-Stainless Platimum Double Edge Razor Blades 50 Ct for about 14 bucks. That will probably last me all here. They are wonderful blades. I get around 7 to 8 really comfortable shaves out of one blade What a deal!!!</li>
    <li> I shave every day with this. I am very happy with this product. i recommend finding blades that work well for you. I like ASTRA.</li>
    <li> The long handle on this razor is great for long strides and can also be held closer to the handle for more precision. Easy to assemble, disassemble, and clean. Works for almost every hand type and person. A little bit heavier then shorter handled razors.</li>
    <li> I have been using this razor for about a week, and when shaving in the direction of the grain it literally just does not work at all.  As in, no cuts or nicks, no razor burn, no hair removed.  Nothing.  All shaves are after taking an extremely hot shower, so it&#x27;s not that either.    I&#x27;m definitely new to safety razor shaving, so I keep thinking I&#x27;m doing something wrong, but when i shave against the grain it cuts quite close (although leaves me with some razor burn).  So I&#x27;m honestly at a loss.  I&#x27;m going to try some new blades (maybe the stock blade that ships with the razor is terrible?) and if that doesn&#x27;t work, I guess I will have to send it back.  Maybe something about my skin.  I&#x27;ll probably try a Merkur Futur if this doesn&#x27;t end up working, since the blade there is adjustable.</li>
    <li> Just received my razor 12/17/2014 and at 930pm I tried my first shave. I absolutely love it and at this point giving 4 stars. I don&#x27;t want to oversell it at this point and YES I do feel like I had a closer shave however I don&#x27;t want it to be &amp;#34;I got a new pair of shoes so I run faster&amp;#34; thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Synopsis: Close shave, absolutely love the razor, don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m going back to the Mach 3. If you are thinking of going DE Safety Razor definitely would recommend this razor. I will test my Mach 3 again in a couple of says when I have some good growth. If I can tell the difference I will give the razor 5 stars. At this point I say jump in, get the razor. Oh also get a shaving pencil for any nics. Those things are so helpful. No nics on my first shave, I&#x27;ve used them in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Categories:&lt;br /&gt;Ease of shaving: My first shave was a bit scary at first. I was very ginger... I&#x27;m handling a RAZOR!! hahaha but after a few strokes I became a little more confident. I think for the next few weeks I will be shaving at night so I don&#x27;t have to rush and can get the hang of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Replacing Blade: Definitely would have liked to find a butterfly open from Merkur at this price. Replacing the blade is not super tough but you will have to handle the 3 parts it unscrews into, the top rounded part, the underside you put the blade on, and the handle. Oh count four parts since you have to put the razor in. Overtime I will get more at ease handling the actual razor however a butterfly opening Safety Razor would have been awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Merkur Blade that comes with it: I grew out my beard for about 3 days to &amp;#34;prep&amp;#34; for the arrival of this razor. The blade that came with it pulled a bit. I did get a close shave but some reviews I&#x27;ve read on the blades say there should be no pulling. I will shave again tomorrow to see what the shave is like after a day. I purchase a sample pack of blades and will go through the same test to see what I find. It&#x27;s possible that the pulling came from me being ginger with razor since it was my first shave. I&#x27;ll let you know. Don&#x27;t let this change your mind on the razor, I would recommend it, just test out some different DE Razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long answer: About 8 years ago I thought about going the Safety razor route but when my local CVS didn&#x27;t carry any, I put it behind me. Didn&#x27;t think of hitting up Amazon, part of it as well was fear of the &amp;#34;Razor Blade&amp;#34; and gashing myself while shaving. So I put it behind me. I read in the 90&#x27;s and 00&#x27;s that the multiple razor was the reason for skin irritation and in grown hairs. So I was always looking for a single blade system, even disposables. Nothing really worked. Well fast forward to 2014 and I started seeing a barber, a legit barber that does shaves with a straight razor. I started talking to him about my desire to use a safety razor and he began to explain to me that it&#x27;s the way to go. You see what he said was with the multiple razor system the first razor wears out in the first or second shave and begin pulling and yanking your hair. That&#x27;s how the in grown hair start and the irritation. He said that a razor should be replaced ever shave or 2-3 shave depending on your beard, skin, and skin sensitivity. Well with any Gillette product that would be crazy. Enter the Safety Razor where a blade will cost .15 cents to .50 cents a piece depending on what you get. He recommended a butterfly open but I couldn&#x27;t find any I liked and I found this one that was Made in Germany, can&#x27;t go wrong with that. Better than China or India. So I settled on the non-butterfly open. If I ever find a nice once I like I&#x27;ll end up getting it. I can see after putting the blade in this one, a butterfly opening razor is easier to put the blade in.</li>
    <li> Nice solid build.  Heavy and durable</li>
    <li> I guess I don&#x27;t have much to compare this to seeing as it&#x27;s my first razor, but, I feel the build quality, the shave, and experience are superb.  The razor has a nice weight to it and the knurling helps when your hands are wet.  I&#x27;ve been learning my technique and have had a difficult time breaking the habit I had with my disposable razors of pushing down while shaving.  It&#x27;s definitely not recommended with these razors.  Overall, great bang for the buck!</li>
    <li> I liked this razor a lot.  I got it as a gift this last year and it&#x27;s given me a great shave since then.  Too bad I had to go back to my old razor which just seems to pull on my whiskers.  Why?  I dropped it in the bathroom and it broke.  The screw that mounts the base of the razor to the handle broke off and won&#x27;t re-secure.  Now I&#x27;m debating getting a new one or switching to something else.</li>
    <li> This razor is the right weight and feels good in my hand.  I would recommend it for anyone.  I&lt;br /&gt;especially like it because the blade is always centered unlike the &amp;#34;butterfly&amp;#34; type razors.</li>
    <li> I like it very much. I use it instead of expensive Gillett cartridges (&amp;#62;$3 per blade).  I use is with &amp;#34;Feather&amp;#34; blades ($0.60 per blade). I get up to 30 shaves on one blade</li>
    <li> Not sure what led me to join the ranks of the DE wet shavers, but I will tell you I am very glad I did.  Truly the best shaves of my life!  I will say it took me about a week before I stopped cutting myself (all over my face and in a dozen spots), but once I passed the learning curve I really can&#x27;t believe the difference.  I only gave the razor 4 stars because I really don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to, other than the multi-blade cartridge shavers and that would be comparing apples to oranges.  But I now have a face that is 100% scruff free and no nicks (makes me wish I hadn&#x27;t ordered the styptic pencil).  Long story short, I am hooked now and have already ordered another Merkur razor based off of a reccomendation.  They say you ultimately save money with de razors because of the low cost of the blades and the razor lasting a lifetime, but if you are like me, one just gets the juices flowing and like potato chips you can&#x27;t just have one!</li>
    <li> This razor is excellent. I just changed my blade for the first time. (one month) I shave daily and went through too many razor blade cartridges. (Fusion) Now it costs me .12 cents a month in razors verse 7 dollars. Not only do I have a huge money savings but the quality of the shave is far more superior.</li>
    <li> I was tired of spending a bloody fortune for Gillette Fusion blades even though it was a good shave. The Merkur delivers an excellent shave, but it takes a bit more time and care to avoid nicks and cuts. The secret is in moistening the beard with water as hot as you can stand, or a hot towel if you have the time. It also helps to spend extra on a good quality shave gel and most of all let the razor do the work.</li>
    <li> This was my first double edge razor, and to say the least I have fell in love with it, I have been living my whole life paying ridiculous prices for the cartridges, where with this razor instead of spending 20 dollars a month shaving I am down to 2 dollars a month. Not to mention this razor with the many different brands I have used, gives me the closest and best shave of my life.</li>
    <li> Like most reviewers, I did a ton of research before committing to a DE razor.  After reading what seemed like hundreds of ecstatic, almost hysterically positive reviews from male shavers, I thought I&#x27;d be crazy to miss this experience.  So I got the Merkur long-handle, a couple of jars of the Italian and English soaps, a box of good razors and let it fly.  The result after a month?  It&#x27;s ok.  Did it cure all my shaving ills and make me a baby-smooth stud?  No.  Did it restore a lost tradition of manhood that put me in touch with the greatest generation?  No.  Did it free me from the tyranny of expensive quadruple-blade cartridges?  On this one, yes.  That&#x27;s probably the main reason to switch -- you will save money while using more fresh razors with a DE than with the latest cheesegrater from Gillette.  But the rest of it is somewhat crazy hype.  DE leaves my face feeling slightly (only slightly) less worked-over but it also leaves a less clean shave.  Think about it -- a single blade will be easier on your skin but also less thorough than four blades.  At bottom, this is really more of a lifestyle choice that has an appealing gear geek aspect to it than a truly revolutionary way to shave.  So buy it if you like that idea but don&#x27;t be suckered into thinking this will change your life.</li>
    <li> Great razor!  I got this about a month ago and have been getting great shaves with it.    Characteristics:  I believe it is the Merkur 23C Long Handled Razor.  It is a three piece double edge safety razor.  It looks great and appears to be well made.  It fits well in my hand and does not slip at all when wet thanks to the knurling.  Both sides were symmetric and even.  After trying a variety of blades, all loaded in precisely and evenly.  Survived a 3 foot drop onto a hard surface unscathed.  it will probably last me 50 years+.  Performance:  Seems not to aggressive but not to mild either.  Can&#x27;t really compare it to other safety razors.  However, beats the hell out of shaving with cartridge razor like the mach3.  From the first shave, it was like night and day.  Personally, no nicks or cuts after 20-25 shaves with this razor.  After getting used to using it, I have been getting near perfect shaves with no discomfort or irritation.  (Though prep before shaving has a lot to do with it)  I would recommend doing a little research before jumping into wet shaving with a double edged (DE) razor.  Great places are badgerandblade and/or geofatboy or mantic59 on youtube.</li>
    <li> Once upon a time I would use cartridge razors. Now I do not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made the switch to the safety razor and I have not looked back. You&#x27;ll get it on the first try. You can do this. This is all you, baby. YOU GOT THIS. It is even safe to use in your most delicate areas, so enjoy the newfound sense of smoothness and sexual prowess. You will never get razor bumps again. You will feel great about yourself.</li>
    <li> I have avoided shaving with a blade for years. My neck tends to break out and it just generally results in discomfort. I have, until now, been shaving with a beard trimmer and keeping short whiskers all around. I had even tried single and double blade disposables, expensive electrics, and nothing really helped prevent the break outs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have shaved for about a week with this razor. At first I was a little intimidated but you really have to TRY to cut yourself. A good lather and proper angle and you&#x27;re good to go. It&#x27;s actually pretty forgiving. The shave is really close and I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts since shaving with it. I have also been using proper lather, brush, toner, aftershave, and shaving after showering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, shaving with it just makes you feel a little bit more like a dude. It helps that my skin looks better when I use this rather than others, too.</li>
    <li> I may sound like an idiot for saying this, but hopefully this may help somebody else that doesn&#x27;t know like I didn&#x27;t.  Make sure the bottom half of the razor head in facing up (grooved channels facing AWAY from the handle...) I did not know this; the razor arrived assembled, but with the bottom half upside down).  Other than that, this razor (so far...) has provided me with the best shave I have ever had; combined with the badger brush and real shaving soap, not that gel crap they use today.  Last night I shaved with modern gel since my brain was not quite working yet and it made my face feel like it was a piece of leather again.  I swear I&#x27;ll never use that crap gel again!</li>
    <li> I decided I had had enough of Gillette&#x27;s high cost Fusion cartridges and picked this razor from reading reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I use it with Feather stainless platinum coated blades and get a smoother shave than with the Gillette Fusion razor. If you haven&#x27;t used a double edge razor for a long time, I would pick this one.&lt;br /&gt;I use Parker&#x27;s  black badger bristle shaving brush and a shaving soap. Also, after several strokes I open the razor a little and let hot water clean it out and continue my shave. Take your time and enjoy the shave shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in the military and always had sergeants coming up to me saying I never shave. I even buy the best products available for regular razors (the ProGlide was my latest). I would shave, while somebody comes INTO the bathroom to do HIS shave.. and I would have more hair on my face then him! Well I got this Merkur recently at a local Art of Shaving store and it is indeed the closet shave I ever got. There is very little evidence of hair on my face but I was pretty scared using the blade as I hate getting cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you go slow your fine, and it&#x27;s almost just like using a regular razor. I don&#x27;t know about the blades as people on shaving forums says the blades aren&#x27;t even that sharp. So it&#x27;s good for a newbie. I will get the more sharper and more highly rated blades however and will be fine with the single blade that came with my Merkur for now.</li>
    <li> Wow.  Cleanest shave ever.  Between years of fighting with plastic, chintzy razors, and electric razors that hurt my skin, I finally found a razor that works great.  Read about the way my grandfather would have shaved, which led me to purchase this product.  Razor is solid, heavy, and works fantastic.  I had no problem with using the razor for the very first time -- I was careful and didn&#x27;t have a single cut on my face when I was finished.  The trick I read was to let the shaver work for you -- Don&#x27;t press hard against the skin, but let the razor just glide across the skin with no pressure from your fingertips on the blade.  The shave was the cleanest shave I have ever experienced, and my face feels great.  I cannot say enough about this product.  Highly recommended.  I don&#x27;t think I will ever go back to shaving any other way.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> The handle feels great in my hand and it is weighted and balanced very nicely. I use this safety razor on my face and head.</li>
    <li> Okay so for 30 something years I have used those multiblade plastic cartridge shavers. They&#x27;re very expensive and the shave isn&#x27;t really all that good. So I thought, lets get back to what Dad used. And I have to say its a great thing! The very low cost and very close shave is an eye opener. I love this safety razor and the shave it gives. And I honesty think you will too. No nicks or cuts, just a smooth clean shave. And the cost? How about a dime a blade! Yep! This is it for me. Goodbye Schick and Gillette. Try this razor!</li>
    <li> Excellent product!!!!!</li>
    <li> Best razor ever. My husband wanted a long handled saftey razor and I got him this one for Christmas. He loves it!</li>
    <li> I like the Fusion razor, but couldn&#x27;t justify the expense.  Decided to try this and have been using for 2 months now.  Great shave! Warning.... Take care of your skin and use a good cream and brush.  This razor takes a little getting used to, but after a couple of weeks I&#x27;m getting a closer shave than with any of the high dollar disposables.  For the small cost of replacement blades this will pay for itself within months. Well built, solid piece.</li>
    <li> A few FAQs about this razor and wet shaving in general:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is this razor worth the money:  Yes.  In addition to being well made and looking sharp (zing) the replacement blades cost about $2 for a pack of ten (at most) compared to $20 for a pack of six Mach 3 heads.  Wet shaving has a high cost of entry but can save you money in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it easy to change the blade:  Yes.  Unscrew the handle, separate the two parts of the head, place the blade on (there are two ways it can go on and both are correct), place the two parts of the head back together, screw the handle back on.  This is not an adjustable razor so you just tighten it down and it will have the correct shaving space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it hard to shave with this razor:  Not really.  Watch a tutorial on Youtube, there are tons.  Not pushing the razor into your face is the biggest tip.  Otherwise you will feel when the razor is cutting correctly or not cutting at all.  Your mileage may vary but most people, including me, have to shave twice to get a good shave and you have to lather twice to do that.  This takes about twice as much time as a traditional Mach 3 (about 10 min. vs. 5 min.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will I cut myself:  Maybe.  I have gotten through three full shaves so far without even the smallest nick.  If you take your time and know your face you should be fine.  If the blade slides sideways or if you have bumps or uneven areas on your face you may nick yourself but it&#x27;s not the end of the world.  I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s 20% easier to nick yourself than with a Mach 3 or similar razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is a safty razor a better shave:  Yes.  The shave itself is not much closer but the experience is much more enjoyable.  I heard someone call it &amp;#34;gourmet shaving&amp;#34; and think that&#x27;s a good description.  Shaving twice with a safty razor gives a better shave than once with a Mach 3 and does not irritate my skin any extra.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do I need anything to go with the razor:  Yes.  It&#x27;s not really worth the effort without the accessories.  Get a badger hair brush ($30 max), good shaving cream (I go with The Art of Shaving, $30 for over a years supply), and I also like pre-shave oil and after-shave lotion (I also get those from The Art of Shaving but there are much less expensive alternatives).  You&#x27;ll also need a stand as the razor doesn&#x27;t come with one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is there any maintenence I need to do for the razor:  A little.  The razor rinses easily and dries quickly on a stand.  I would recommend spraying a little rubbing alcohol on the blade after rinsing.  I&#x27;ve also heard of people putting a little baby oil on the blade after the alcohol.  Just keep it mind (for all razors) that the blade doesn&#x27;t bend or chip because of shaving.  Your whiskers are not that strong.  It&#x27;s the small amount of rust and/or buildup on the blade that decreases its effectiveness.  Dry it quickly and keep it lubricated and your blade will last months.</li>
    <li> So after only shaving once per week due to burn, and other skin probs, doc said i should try the simple DE razor (only after 36 years he says this?) Did my homework (100&#x27;s of reviews and web blogs FYI out there) and I kept ending up at this 180 Merkur Razor. Ordered this one and to my surprise arrived a day early. OK for real, not that hard to use at all! after one month now and 12 shaves, i still love this thing! good weight, good feel, and close shave!     Some people say that the blade that comes with it is crap, i disagree, so far its been the best one and I&#x27;m using it as my \\&quot;baseline.\\&quot; Order a sample pack... If your a Chevy fan I&#x27;m not going to convince you on a review, online to buy a Ford... regardless on which blade i choose, yours will be diff. you have to find the one that works for you and your face.     5 Stars, for the razor as well as for the seller.</li>
    <li> Best investment ever this is a wonderful razor with great balance.</li>
    <li> Works as intended.  No more paying for BS multiblade Gilettes and Schicks.  I started championing DE Safety Razors to everyone I know after getting this thing.  Even bought one for my brother.  Can&#x27;t go wrong and seems extremely well built.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only advise is make sure the parts are screwed tightly together.  Let it get loose one day, exposing more blade, and my face and neck suffered greatly for it.</li>
    <li> here is the deal i have been using safety razors for over 35 years, my first one was one i found at my grandfathers in the shed. i discovered once i joined the Marines that disposable razors sucked and did not produce a Marine Corps quality shave, my next one was a cheap model i got at the PX , it lasted plenty of years and was held together by pieces of wire and tape it was tough but was not consistent in delivering a comfortable shave, i then went thru a couple of cheap china models and was not happy at all finally broke down a got this one and man did it make a difference, i look forward to shaving every day you get what you pay for and quality does count i am totally going to stick with German quality and if i live long enough to wear this one out will buy a Merkur again, this will be the razor i train my sons on and get for them</li>
    <li> One of the best gifts I have ever given.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Should have purchased this a long time ago.</li>
    <li> So this is my first DE razor, it definitely is more work/time then a mach 3 (much better for your face then those dumb 5 blade systems).     So why 5 stars? Because it just FEELS better. It&#x27;s smoother more comfortable, and just feels quality. From the weight to the way you can feel the blade riding along your skin, it feels luxurious. The problem is..... if you take your time, and pay attention, use HOT water and get a good lather, you can get closer then any cartridge razor. If not you&#x27;re either going to be left with more stubble then a mach 3, or you&#x27;ll cut yourself/over shave and irritate your skin.    Make sure you get a badger brush, some good soap/cream, and a aftershave lotion (I LOVE the art of shavings lemon afterhsave lotion!) and take your time.    For the past month i&#x27;ve had this i&#x27;ve only used the mach 3 once because i needed a quick close shave, otherwise i try to make time to use my Merkur because you&#x27;ll just enjoy it more. The same way driving stick is a lot more work and practice.... there&#x27;s just something about the feeling of slotting the gear and operating the clutch that feels right.     You just feel more connected to the activity.</li>
    <li> Great weight and classy design.  The long handle helps me get the right grip on the razor to just let gravity do most of the work.</li>
    <li> Because M.D.C. did such a nice review I&#x27;m just going to keep this short. It&#x27;s funny how some things that are the \\&quot;old\\&quot; way are better than the new. I have very sensitive skin, and have always had a problems with shaving. I have tried everything, however the best results were with the single blade disposables, that is until I got the Merkur 180. The shave is very close, but doesnt give my razor burn. My face looks good and feels good too. I just wish I knew about this razor years ago.  F.Y.I. I never really liked shaving creams because they dried my face out really bad. If you&#x27;re looking for something better, try using lotion. I wet my face first, and then put a generous amount of lotion on my face. If you shave in the shower, try hair conditioner.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my boyfriend&#x27;s birthday after he showed interest when were watching an episode of How It&#x27;s Made.  I was really nervous about it arriving in time but Simply Beautiful assured me it would be here before his birthday and it was! He was thrilled with his present and loves how smooth and close the shave is. Thank you very much!</li>
    <li> I tried two other safety razors before I found this one.  I threw the first one in the garbage (it was that bad), the second I gave to my brother.  This one I&#x27;m keeping.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is it&#x27;s not a butterfly (design) razor.  Other than that, it gives as good a shave as I&#x27;ve ever had, and not one nick/cut yet (and I cut easily).  Recommend this razor wholeheartedly!</li>
    <li> Great quality. Goodbye Gillette Fusion Pro Glide!!</li>
    <li> Very good quality and fashionable!</li>
    <li> This is the best shaver money can buy. Not only is it strong, but it easy very smooth. It&#x27;s so good I had to buy my wife one.&lt;br /&gt;Now there is a learning curve and the first few times there will be blood, but after that you should be fine.&lt;br /&gt;The razors are super cheap, not more paying $30 dollars for 5 new blades. You can get 25 razors for $5 dollars.&lt;br /&gt;This is a must buy for all the shaver out there!</li>
    <li> Well made, solid safety razor with a good sample blade in the box. I love this thing!</li>
    <li> I made the switch to this old school razor about two months ago. I am completely satisfied! Razors are cheap(I paid ten bucks for a hundred). I usually get about 3-4 shaves out of each one.</li>
    <li> Retro design, high quality.  Get the stand, too.</li>
    <li> This razor will not rust or break on you I have mine in the shower where it is always wet no problems highley recomend as a way to get a closer shave and save a ton of money</li>
    <li> I love my long handle Merkur. It&#x27;s beautiful, and it is actually an easy razor to use. I always liked the older safety razors. I never figured that they woul outperform the three and four blade models if the new age.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, easy to clean, haven&#x27;t cut myself at all. Recommended.</li>
    <li> Gives gentile BBS shaves.  Very light and controlable.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical about how difficult this product would be to use after reading a lot of the other reviews, but it&#x27;s as easy and as straightforward as any other razor I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For sure, this razor is closer to using a low-end single or double blade disposable razor, except that I&#x27;ve found it to be better at cutting than the equivalent disposable razor. I also found that I didn&#x27;t need to use any fancy lather to shave, just a regular can of barbasol shaving cream did the trick. I&#x27;m not sure if other people that used this have gone from doing dry shaves with the multi-blade razors, but I had no trouble getting a good shave out of this thing on the first try.</li>
    <li> I recently made the switch from multi-blade razors, to double edge safty razor, brush, and shaving soap.  Before i baught a razor i did do research.  What I found was almost everyother brand was being compared to the merkur so I went with the \\&quot;gold\\&quot; standard.  I also picked this one due to the extended handle.  Figured it would be easy to use for a beginner.  My reasons aside i love this razor.</li>
    <li> Safety razor preference is a very personal thing and will vary depending on beard type, shaving technique and personal taste, so your mileage may vary. The Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor is well made and functions just fine, and the quality is very good for the price. It is a fairly mild razor, good for beginners or those with sensitive skin. I haven&#x27;t found any particular advantage to the longer handle, but it doesn&#x27;t cause any problems either. This is a three-piece razor, which makes changing blades a bit more awkward than with the twist-to-open types. I think I would like it better if it was a bit heavier, but with a decent blade, in the right hands, the Merkur 180 is more than capable of delivering a close, comfortable shave</li>
    <li> I bought this razor for my husband because he wanted to go back to using a single blade razor. He said that the razor is a little dangerous because the whole head comes off and not the kind that opens at the top, to replace the blade.  I tried, but the next time I will make sure it opens at the top.</li>
    <li> I would return this if I could. I thought this would have been a terrific razor considering the reviews. However, after a few months of use and switching blades (again, switching) I have noticed that one side shows more blade than the other...hence one side of the shave is \\&quot;closer\\&quot;. Not sure what to do.</li>
    <li> I have a Merkur razor.  The finish is flaking off and the handle retainer spring fell out.  Merkur would not warranty the razor.  They said I had \\&quot;bad water\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a 40 year old Gillete used in the same water.  Guess what?  No flaking.  I will never buy another Merkur product.  Don&#x27;t say I did not warn you!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow-up.........After more than a year of battling with Merkur they finally replaced my razor. I sold it as the original was so bad and if it were to have the same finish issues I would not want to battle with Merkur again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that Merkur never admitted to anything being wrong with the razor. They kept blaming it on me. At one point they even suggested I had acid come in contact with it. All in all very ridiculous in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe all the money I wasted on those disposable blades over the years. This thing shaves 10x better and the blades are only a few cents.</li>
    <li> Excellent razor, been using this for a good while now, it&#x27;s exactly what it says on the tin. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> Best shave ever, much better than proglide or any thing else I have used once you get comfortable with it. Would recommend feather blades though</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll be up front and say that this product may not be for everyone. If, however, you&#x27;re like me and have a five o&#x27;clock shadow that is as coarse as 60 grit sandpaper, then I highly recommend this product. I would also suggest doing some research on using safety razors if you are considering making the switch. There are a lot of great reviews as well as youtube videos on the subject.    I won&#x27;t get into any of the details of why this is a superior product, I&#x27;ll let others preach on that subject. All I will say is that before I got this product I used to dread shaving, but now I enjoy it.    Be sure to get a shave brush and some shave soap as well if you&#x27;re going to use a safety razor.    Also as a side note, you have to be patient when learning how to use this. This is a very different shave than a gillette or schick razor. You need to take your time when learning how to use this - don&#x27;t be afraid of getting a few small nicks here and there.    As a side note, the first time I used this razor, I&#x27;d never been so nervous to shave in my life - now, a little over a month later I feel much more comfortable using this. I&#x27;m never going back to a disposable multi-blade razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to shaving with a safety razor, but am no stranger to shaving with a straight blade. My problems is that this razor is simply not aggressive enough! Can anyone recommend a handle that gives the blade more bite?</li>
    <li> Ever watch an old movie and see how shaving should be? The manly morning ritual your grandpa followed can be a part of your morning routine. This is one of the best razors ever made, high quality metal construction means this will be an item you can pass on to your offspring. Be sure to get a high quality shaving cream and brush to complete your classic shaving kit.</li>
    <li> This product made me enjoy shaving. Prior to the Merkur DE razor, I used disposable multi-blade razors when I shaved. I purchased the razor after being turned onto the idea of trying out a DE razor.  I have had the razor for a few weeks now, and I have to say, I&#x27;m very impressed. It does require one to adjust shaving techniques from multiple blade razors, but once that&#x27;s learned, it provides a great shave. Definitely worth a try if you&#x27;re thinking of it.</li>
    <li> I cannot even begin to tell you how many different disposable and cartridge razors I&#x27;ve tried in search of that perfect shave with no irritation. Long story short I&#x27;ve tried them all. I had been using the Mach 3 for the longest period of time then the Shick Hydro series came out and I tried those. At first it was all good  but my skin got irritated having to shave every day so I went back to the Gillette Good News two blade disposables that my dad used and those worked good as far as irritation but I just wasn&#x27;t getting the shave I wanted. As fate would have it I stumbled across DE Safety Razors on Amazon and remembered my grandpa and his safety razor and how he would always have the most perfect closest shave.    I began to do my research and decided to pick up the Merkur 180 for my first DE safety razor. I honestly don&#x27;t know what took me so long to make the switch. I am more than pleased with everything about this razor. The fit is perfect for my hands, the weight of the razor feels great, I like the 3 piece design opposed to other butterfly style safety razors, very easy to clean, it looks damn good, and gives me the closest, smoothest, shave I have ever had. It has made me relearn the way I shave and I actually enjoy taking my time and getting a great shave. I&#x27;ve never had any problems cutting myself at all or gotten any irritation.The Merkur 180 accompanied with a good shave cream or soap (I use Proraso) and a good badger brush to lather up with and some good DE blades(I use Shark blades but like others have said if you&#x27;re new to DE wet shaving get yourself a sampler pack to pick the best ones for you) and you&#x27;ll have a great shaving experience.</li>
    <li> I came to this after using a cartridge razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works great, better shave than the cartridge and it is easier to clean up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus the blades are cheaper than dirt. Im still working on my first blade right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Takes a bit to get used to, but once you do its really easy.</li>
    <li> Just received this razor for Christmas. It has been a pleasure beginning to shave with this razor. I shave my face and my head. It had a much shorter learning curve than I had anticipated. My first couple shaves were not very smooth or close but that was due to my timidness with the razor. Once I trusted the razor I have had just as close a shave as I have ever had use a Mach III or Schick Hydro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I have now been shaving with this razor for 7 months. It still shaves well and has retained its chrome finish. I have cut myself a few times but never significantly and always because I was trying to rush the job. If you&#x27;re worried about cutting yourself, you can rest assured you probably won&#x27;t feel it. The razors are so sharp I just could feel I did something wrong and then would see spots of blood. Overall, I am still pleased with this razor and don&#x27;t have any of intention of going back to the old disposables. In addition, I recently bought the 100 pack of Derby razors you can find on Amazon ($7 when I bought them) and they have worked great.</li>
    <li> Great razor for a great price.  My first double edge in years and I love it!</li>
    <li> I decided to buy this razor after reading all of the good reviews about it and I was not disappointed. After buying this and shaving with it, I know I have been getting ripped off when it comes to buying the three and four blade razors from Gillette/Schick etc... Each razor lasts for around 5 shaves or so and you can get 100 replacement blades for less than ten bucks. After realizing this, I bought one for my dad for his birthday as well as 100 replacement blades. As far as how easy it is to shave with this thing, you don&#x27;t really need to watch a video, the keys are this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Let the weight of the blade do the cutting, don&#x27;t push hard or brute force it at all.&lt;br /&gt;-Use warm water and let the blade warm up with the water so that it is warm as you use it.&lt;br /&gt;-Make sure the blade is wet and your face is as well, you want to make sure your face has the proper amount of lubrication so that it doesn&#x27;t snag at all because these are very sharp.&lt;br /&gt;-Shave with the grain, not against (avoids ingrown hairs and resistance).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will provide you with a very close shave and you&#x27;ll feel like an old school bad-ass man for using it afterward...like one of those guys from Gangs of New York.</li>
    <li> High quality razor. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my grown son for Christmas. He was beyond ecstatic. His first question was if I just chose razor randomly or picked it particularly. He said this because this one was the exact one he wanted. I picked it because I believed it to be the best one. After using it, he still agrees that it is the best he could use. He gets a smooth shave and it fits well in his hand. When I buy another it will be this brand.</li>
    <li> I decided to purchase this razor to get rid of my mach 17 because I was tired of buying replacement cartridges. I&#x27;m new to using a safety razor and here are some hints:  -Always wet shave, dont try to shave dry, even small areas or touch ups. This thing will eat your skin if you do.  -Be careful with bumps. My mach 28 would irritate my neck bumps, safety razors will cut them off.    I&#x27;ve found the Merkur 180 to be a good razor overall. I love the weight of it, it helps newbies not cut themselves up (too bad). I also like the length and grip of the handle. When wet shaving I&#x27;ve never been concerned about it sliding out of my grasp or twisting around in my hand.    The one fault, and the reason it gets only four stars is that because the razor has a decent sized head it&#x27;s nearly impossible to trim my upper lip to my nose. I&#x27;m left with a really small area (really, really small) I need to cut with something else. It&#x27;s a small problem but is a bit of a hassle having to get such a good shave and leave one area out.</li>
    <li> I used to dread shaving.  I have super sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve tried electric shaver and Gillette fusion and other past Gillette razors. I would get bumps and rash after each shave.  Couple days later, the bumps and rash would start to flake so my face looked awful.  Two weeks of researching pointed to Merkur with Proraso shaving cream.  After one shave with Merkur using Proraso shaving cream I got the best shave in my 25+ years of shaving.  No bumps or rashes.  My face looks and feels smooth.  I am actually excited to shave now.  Anyhow, Merkur is a solid piece of metal.  Easy to disassemble to replace blade and clean.  So easy you can do it with one hand.    Now the bad side: You will have to go through a learning curve which should only take 3-5 shaves.  You&#x27;ll need to figure out the recommended 30% angle and how it feels in your hand.  Also the dome shape on top makes it a bit tricky to shave under your nose but should be able to figure out the best method after several shaves.    I will never go back to using protected razor blades again.  Good bye Gillette.  Hello Merkur.    So if you have super sensitive skin drop the 3 blade pull, tug and cut process by Gillette and get yourself a Merkur and you will get the best shave of your life.</li>
    <li> I really wish I had grown up with this rather than disposables that last for about 2-3 shaves and cost more than 2.50 a cartridge..   Double edge blades cost less than 50 cents and im going on my 4th shave with the same one.  Although the learning experience was painful and nicked myself pretty badly, I&#x27;ve gotten better.  Honestly I would have to say the the technique relies a lot on the preparation of shaving, without the proper lubrication on the face it will be very painful, just be sure to get some shaving soap and pre shave  Im hoping to not discourage anyone as this is a great way to shave, but read up before you buy it and it will be very well worth the while.  Products necessary to accommodate the merkur are shaving soap, pre and post shave cream and a shaving brush</li>
    <li> After reading blogs and watching YouTube videos about double edge razor shaving I decided to take the plunge. I have been shaving nearly every day since I was 16 (I&#x27;m 33 at the time of this review). I have used cheap disposables, all the Gillette cartridge razors (Mach 3, Fusion, Fusion Prozglide) and countless electric models (4 different models ranging from $50 to $200 in price). While I could get a good close shave with the Gillette cartridge razors, I could only get 2-3 shaves out of them before they were dull and needed replacement. At $3-$4 a cartridge this gets very pricey.  I bought this razor and it is very good and solid. Nothing real fancy but it&#x27;s got a little heft to it and works just fine. The blades you use are going to be more important than the razor itself. The biggest factor for the razor is the ergonomics of it (how it fits in your hand). This razor works fine for me. I might upgrade to the HD series later on but this is a great start for anyone considering taking the plunge. I don&#x27;t see any reason why this razor won&#x27;t last many years. For starters I would recommend the 7 am blades as they are not too sharp and can give you a good close shave without the fear of nicks and cuts.  I am using the Art Of Shaving products (unscented) and I really like them a lot. The cost is much higher but with a badger brush, the cream will last much longer. I should be able to go about a year with my products which ultimately works out to be about the same as buying cheaper creams and gels. A good badger brush is a must if you step into this. I bought the Art of Shaving premium brush but I&#x27;m sure equally good brushes can be found for less money. Just make sure it has real badger hair.  If you&#x27;re new to Double Edge shaving or will be buying this to get started don&#x27;t get discouraged if your first shave isn&#x27;t very good or if you cut and nick yourself a lot. My first shave was terrible but I gave it a second try and it is getting much better each time. After about oneweek, I was very confident with the blade and am getting really nice close shaves with no irritation and no cuts or nicks. I don&#x27;t even have to use my Alom block anymore because I am not cutting myself like I did with cartridge razors!  I estimated that I am saving about $200 a year on razor blades by going this route versus cartridge razors. It does take a little longer to do. I am spending about 10-15 minutes shaving versus 5 minutes but it is a very satisfying experience and not only is it cheaper but I have almost no irritation at all. I shave every day (sometimes twice a day if there is a special event to go to in the evening). Take the plunge you&#x27;ll be satisfied with the switch and your wallet will like it too!  ** Update 1/21/12 **  After using this for less than a month, I noticed the handle is crooked and the blade is uneven on both sides. One side the blade sticks out much further than the other side. I was wondering why I wasn&#x27;t getting the great shaves everyone raves about and I suspect this might be it. I have gone back to my ProGlide for the time being and it is providing great shaves as well. I&#x27;m past the return window with Amazon so I have to just buy a new razor. I&#x27;m pretty disappointed.</li>
    <li> After using disposables for years I decided to invest in a safety razor- After reading the reviews- decided this one was the best one (since I&#x27;m new to safety razors).... Easy to use- and the results are AWESOME...Ladies, it&#x27;s better than waxing...Leaves your skin BUTTER soft! I use it to shave my legs, underarms, and bikini area- yep! and NO ingrown hairs- nope! My man loves how soft my skin is- Hair free and butter soft....emmmmmmm- ditch the disposables- MERKUR is the bEST...Great craftmanship I might add! WORTHY investment!!!</li>
    <li> I was becoming fed up with the cost of disposable &amp; cartridge razors, and after the purchase of one particularly bad batch of Gillette Fusion cartridges (felt like I was dragging a jagged scythe across my face) I decided to make the switch to a DE wet shave.  After reading tons of reviews, I decided on the Merkur 180 to start with.  Short review:  I&#x27;ve been using this razor for just over a month now, and have enjoyed a close, nick-free shave from day one using the Merkur.  Would buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a detailed review, and understand this is coming from the perspective of a dedicated (30 year+) multiblade cartridge shaver:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality of the product is excellent, so far.  The plating is perfect, and I try to keep it looking nice by drying the unit well post-shave and keeping it on an Escali stand.  Weight and balance are about perfect, and I do like the longer handle of this model.  It is a traditional three-piece design, but disassembly/reassembly for blade changes are simple unless you&#x27;re a total spastic...  Mid-shave if you do get clogged up, a couple of turns of the handle loosens the head enough to easily flush the blade gap clean.  More on blade gap later...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know, I just LMAO at some of the one-star reviews of this razor, it seems that so many folks try to blame the product for what really amounts to poor technique in describing how they can&#x27;t get a close shave, are destroying their face--whatever.  This is a very simple tool.  You just have to acquire the skills to use it.  I&#x27;ve been DE shaving for only a month or so.  I have never cut myself.  I only attribute this to having made the commitment to learning basic technique before I actually put sharp objects against my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use TOBS cream, an Escali brush, and do a three pass shave (WTG, XTG &amp; ATG) plus touch up.  A lot of time I do my touch up in the shower without a mirror,  still no nicks or cuts.  This razor has a *very* forgiving design.  Perhaps, just a bit tooforgiving.  It comes back to the blade gap--it might be just a little too small.  I do find myself having to quite a bit of touch up, sometimes even a whole fourth pass, to get as close as I want.  And what I want is a barbershop-quality shave every time.  This is why I am giving four stars instead of five.  The razor needs to be just a tad more aggressive, exposing a bit more blade, to do exactly what I want it to do.  That said, I would say this is as close to perfect as you can get if you are a newcomer to DE shaving as I was.  This razor won&#x27;t bite you, unless you force it to, and that just ain&#x27;t the razor&#x27;s fault.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For blades, I will say the Merkur blade supplied is adequate, but no more.  On the advice of others I bought some Feather blades, and they are awesome.  I get 3-4 shaves from a fresh Feather blade, and swap it out when I feel it starting to drag a bit.  Bought in quantity at .35 a piece, I&#x27;d say there&#x27;s no substitute.  YMMV, of course.  try several types and see what works best for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now enjoying my daily shave routine much more with this razor and some traditional shaving tools.  Sure, it takes five minutes longer than those 3,4,5 or 20-bladed monstrosities, but it&#x27;s time well invested.  I&#x27;ve only got one face.  Might as well treat it the best I can.</li>
    <li> Provides a great shave, if you are patient. Much more affordable than modern razors.</li>
    <li> I got used to this thing really quickly. Like by the third shave. I wish it had the cool flippy top thing, but it&#x27;s still pretty cool. I used to buy cartridges at $15-$20 a pack, now I have this and a box of 100 blades that cost a fraction of that. The shaves do feel better afterward too.</li>
    <li> I remember watching my dad shave with a safety razor and since have always wanted one. Unfortunately multiblade razors were all that seemed available when I began to shave.  Since, I purchased this razor and wont go back.</li>
    <li> Might as well make it an even 90 (reviews)...  The first step of this journey started when I noticed what appeared to be my dad&#x27;s old razor in a high-end gift catalog...  The journey ended at one of the world&#x27;s oldest &amp; best razor makers, Merkur.  I also learned that I&#x27;m not the only one who resents the price of disposable blades.    Most important facts/lessons learned:  *Budget a minimum of $75-$100, if you are planning a switch to (real) wet-shaving.   The shave is only as good/comfortable as the weakest-link.  \\&quot;In for a Penny, in for a Pound\\&quot;...might as well go all the way now, so you can really judge/decide accurately, for yourself if real (old school) wet-shaving is for you.    *If you&#x27;ve been using a modern disposable, then this is the perfect replacement, due to it&#x27;s longer handle it will feel familiar &amp; natural.   The \\&quot;Open Comb\\&quot; model for those with heavy (hairy-guy) beards.   The acclimation to these types of razors is simply the time it takes the user to stop freaking out about the possibility of cutting themselves with such a hefty piece of quality hardware.   No worries. Use your usual shaving method/stroke, just don&#x27;t press so hard. You won&#x27;t have to.  You may need to double-check if the hair is actually being shaved off since the shave-glide is so smooth...like the first time you used (snuck) Dad&#x27;s...w/o a blade!! Oh sure, like I&#x27;m the ONLY one that&#x27;s ever done that...    *The design &amp; quality of this Merkur (straight bar) razor has stood the \\&quot;Test-of-Time\\&quot;, the only real test of anything really.  Do some more razor research &amp; read more reviews of actual customers. Nuff&#x27; said.    *The only way to get a closer shave is with a straight-razor (feel lucky?) or with the older/original razor design that uses a   torque-type head which really brings the blade close to the skin. Both are better suited for the younger/tighter skin set.    *Find a nice Badger brush (start @ $20) &amp; Stand (start @ $4), keep shipping charges in mind (sic).  Yes, Badger (vs. Boaror Synth.) is a difference you can feel/distinguish. No need to spend more than on the razor though.    *Select one of the many great shaving soaps (Col.C, Pros., Omega, etc.) (start @ $2) &amp; bowl (start @ $7). Mug optional.    *Merkur, Feather, &amp; Derby are the blades of choice. All great! Go for price/deal.  The way to make (all) blades last a long time is to dry them (blades) or store them (razor w/blade) in mineral-oil.  This prevents micro-rust &amp; hard-water deposits from forming on the blades.   You didn&#x27;t think your hair was actually dulling the heat-treated laser-polished/layered stainless-steel blades so quickly?  Yes, stainless-steel rusts and hard-water particles can cut/nick skin. Oh, it&#x27;s true...  Dad&#x27;s can try using a baby-food jar &amp; baby oil, since they&#x27;re generally abundant in the house, to store the razor (w/blade).  FYI-Wipe-off oil with TP (vs. rinse-off), prior to shave to avoid build-up in sink drain/plumbing.    If you find that this shaving method/hardware is not for you...The Gillette Fusion really does live up to the marketing hype and you can get blade refills online (start @ $2).    Shower-Shavers:  *All mirrors will fog, condensate, or get wet during shaving, to some degree.  Magnified mirrors (x5) are a great upgrade/accessory.  Mirror attachment-integrity (how well the mirror stays attached) is everything!  Rarely will one feel more vulnerable than when wet, butt-naked, now hurried, in a shower (floor) covered in broken glass.    Hope this helps in your decision/research making.  Enjoy da shave!!</li>
    <li> Shaved with this and the Taylor Sandalwood cream this morning for the first time, and love the shave.  Also love the price, because I hate paying so much for Gillette razors.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve never used a double-edged (DE) safety razor, this will probably give you a closeness in your shave you&#x27;ve never felt before. The razor has a nice weight to it and switching out blades couldn&#x27;t be easier. Just unscrew the top piece and drop a blade in. Speaking of blades, they&#x27;re very high quality, but you won&#x27;t cut yourself unless you apply too much pressure. The blade is sandwiched between two pieces of chrome-plated metal, so you have to hold the razor at an angle to get the blade to glide across your skin. If the angle isn&#x27;t just right, the blade won&#x27;t make contact, which obviously accomplishes nothing. After a couple of tries, though, I was already getting the hang of it. The shave leaves my skin feeling smooth like a babe&#x27;s bum and there&#x27;s absolutely no skin irritation, even when I go against the grain. It&#x27;s like cutting butter; there&#x27;s no uncomfortable tugging or pulling. On the other hand, shaving with those fully disposable plastic monstrosities would always leave me with razor bumps if I went against the grain, so I had to sacrifice a close shave to protect my skin. As a result, I used to dread shaving. Now it&#x27;s something I look forward to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many men now are growing up with the cheapy plastic razors (which are also bad for the environment) and they think the shave is fine because it&#x27;s all they know. I just knew after heading out the door with irritated skin that there had to be a better way. Certain products enhance the shaving experience, such as badger brushes and old-timey shave creams, but they are by no means necessary; I smear on soap or shampoo and I&#x27;m good to go. You will actually save money using a DE safety razor; you spend $30 for the razor then blades are less than a dollar each, and you&#x27;ll get at least four or five shaves per blade. You will never want to go back to the fully disposables or the costly cartridge-based razors. I will update this review in a few years for the sake of commenting on the build quality. If I recall correctly, the handle of this razor is made of brass while the head is made of zamak or pot metal, which deteriorates from water damage over time once the chrome plating comes off. But that could take up to a decade. For now, though, I&#x27;m thrilled with how smooth this razor leaves my face and the Merkur blades have also been excellent (I bought a ten-pack of blades along with the razor). I find myself running my fingers across my face because the blades leave my skin so soft and smooth, and I never feel like my skin has been scraped raw. Quit paying for overpriced junk and give your face the shave it deserves., the handle of this razor is made of brass while the head is made of zamak or pot metal, which deteriorates from water damage over time once the chrome plating comes off.

    <li> This is the way to shave.</li>
    <li> no different from Gillette</li>
    <li> Adjusted quickly to the new process and am enjoying the new shave.  At 80 went back to the shaving method  of my youth.</li>
    <li> Popped this under the tree for husband this year.  He is enjoying it a lot, and is saving money on razor blades (which really makes him happy).  It&#x27;s taken him a few good tries to get the hang of it, but he says it&#x27;s well worth it.  (I personally notice his face is extra-extra smooth.  Nice for kissin&#x27;!)</li>
    <li> A few months ago I gave up on electric shavers after about 30 years of use. I then chose Mach3 razors and a gel shaving cream. Shaves were OK but not great. I was then taken in by the claims of many that the best shave was achieved by an old-fashioned double edge razor of the type I used many years ago. I bought a Merkur razor. It looks OK but could have been better made. It came with one sample razor blade. That blade gave me a rough shave. I discarded it after three shaves and bought a pack of 10 no name blades at my grocery store. I have noticed this same blade at various outlets, all under different house brands. After struggling through 7 of these blades with cuts and razor burn I gave up on double edge shaving and returned to Mach 3. I have been getting an acceptable shave with Mach 3 and Barbasol shave cream. I will not return to double edge shaving and its nicks and irritation. I have often wondered who writes all these rave reviews for double edge shaving!</li>
    <li> I love this razor! I was raised using this type of razor. I&#x27;ve tried thousands of disposable razors in my life time. None of them come close to how well this safety razor does its job. You do need to e careful as the razors for it are extremely sharp and you can cut yourself really bad  I like this type of shave for my legs because I do not have to shave them as often. I was having to use disposable razors too often and my legs and underarms were breaking out and beginning to get that \\&quot;raw\\&quot; feeling. I do use the safety razor on my underarms as well, just gently. I couldn&#x27;t find a safety razor here because they are considered to be outdated but I can get the razors. There were a few men who knew what I was talking about but they didn&#x27;t know where I could get one off the shelf! Thanks to Amazon and Merker for an excellent product that came quickly in the mail.</li>
    <li> Love it, great price, does the job and looks great</li>
    <li> Razor works as advertised! No nicks or cut so far. Will save a fortune on blades. Looks Badass on my bathroom sink.</li>
    <li> The head of this razor is very well balanced and actually makes a big difference in keeping the blade at the correct angel.  shaves smoother than the cheap-o $9 DE razor I first tried.  I use razor, Poraso pre-shave, Poraso shaving cream (in the tube), Feather DE blades, and Burt&#x27;s Bees aftershave and shaving is now a pleasurable experience no longer to be dreaded.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor for my husband for Christmas. He really likes it and has had no complaints so far. I am thinking about purchasing one for myself.</li>
    <li> Great shave, great razor! I&#x27;ve even dropped this thing on my hard tile floor and not a dent, not a crack in coat, can&#x27;t even tell that it has been dropped. It comes with one Merkur blade which wasn&#x27;t too bad, but there are better blades out there. This razor is very forgiving, I can shave within minutes with this razor and not get any nicks. The only problem I ran into with this razor is that the head is a bit thick, so if you want to do any landscaping/cleaning up (beards, sideburns, etc) it can be very challenging to make sure you&#x27;re doing it straight. So because of this, sometimes what I will do is use the Merkur to shave, and then use a disposable to do the cleanup and straightening.</li>
    <li> I was using a Gillette Fusion razor, and decided after my cartridges had ran out, that I would try this. The reviews were great, and the cost savings on replacement blades was huge. I realized it would take some time to learn how to use this new razor. After two weeks, I can&#x27;t for the life of me figure out why ANYONE would use this razor... It doesn&#x27;t shave as close as my Gillette Fusion, and it causes a lot of razor burn. The razor works OK on the face, but the neck? Forget about it. Don&#x27;t waste your time with this razor. The replacement blades for it are cheap, but you get what you pay for. After two weeks, this thing is in the garbage, and my Gillette Fusion Proglide is back on the counter. Using this razor is like playing tennis with an old wood racket from the 50&#x27;s. It may be nostalgic, but it is about as useful as a poopie flavored lolly pop.</li>
    <li> The gentleman who produced the video review detailing this razor&#x27;s features did a magnificent job, so I&#x27;ll keep this review abridged.  This razor is a great introduction to older-style shaving, especially if you prefer not to use a straight razor a la Sweeny Todd.  This razor is heavy-duty and retains a great deal of heat from hot water.  The blade supplied with this razor was not too impressive and did not hold its edge for too long, but quality replacements are cheap and easy to come by.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is an easy transition to those like me who have shaved with cartridge-style razors their whole life.  The rounded top is especially helpful in establishing the proper angle of the blade to your face.  You may nick yourself a few times in getting used to this razor, but I&#x27;ve never had a closer shave on any other razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It amazes me now how little impact multiple blades have on the closeness of your shave.  I must admit, I fell for the more-is-better marketing used by the cartridge manufacturers, faithfully upgrading to the latest cartridge razors over the years.  Funny thing is, they all pretty much shave the same.  I never got any closer with a Fusion than I did a Mach 3.  If you&#x27;re tired of taking out a second mortgage when your razor cartridge gets dull, consider this product.  I&#x27;ll never go back.</li>
    <li> I did a bit of shopping around before i decided on this razor. i am not a crazy acolyte of the safety razor or anything. i don&#x27;t care much about throwing out plastic and metal every time i switch blades. the only factor that drew me into safety razors was the price. once a year i used to buy an 18 pack of fusion blades for 40$. then when i got to the last blade i would keep it for months dreading needing to buy more...&lt;br /&gt;40$ a year isn&#x27;t that much really. but that is at costco. that is in bulk. a single cartridge for 2-4$ is ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;so i decided that i would rather pay 30 bucks once then pay for 10c blades ever more.&lt;br /&gt;what i didn&#x27;t really consider is that i enjoy shaving more now... i used to shave 1-3 times a week or less... it would take a long time, and pull my hair. i didn&#x27;t like it so i put it off more and more... with the safety blade regardless of length it is a nice shave, after about a week of shaves and i notice it isn&#x27;t as smooth, it isn&#x27;t bad by any means but it isn&#x27;t as beautiful, and i don&#x27;t have a problem switching blades because it is cheap...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;anyway. i don&#x27;t know if this helps anyone. but whatev :p</li>
    <li> It seems a little awkward to change and clean the blade. To half to unscrew the handle to access the blade isn&#x27;t as convenient as the old system where all you had to do was twist the handle.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite razor in fifty years! I should have been using this and single blades all along. Been late then never.</li>
    <li> I have use Gillette razors for the majority of my life and couldn&#x27;t begin to tell you how much I&#x27;ve spent on them.  This  razor shaves as close if not closer for a fraction of the cost.  It took about a week of shaving every other day to get used to it and get the right angle.  For every pass of a razor you remove a layer of skin (so I have read).  With the Fusion you are removing 5 layers with just one swipe; with this, only one.  My face thanks me!!</li>
    <li> I use this razor to shave my head, its not very agressive so its perfect for shaving blind. even though its not very agressive it still gets much closer than the old gillet 6 blade I used for years. I changed because I was sick of spending $50 a month just to shave my head. I use persona blades and they last for about 6 shaves. On top of it getting closer, being cheeper, and cooler to use I noticed when I used pre-oils and after shave that I no longer got razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;This is the first one I got and I used it to learn with. i would deffinatly refer others just getting in to wet shaving to get this as a cheap starter. Its very sturdy, as well as forgiving. When I was first shaving my face with it, it got very close and I very rarely nicked myself. Just let it do the work and dont force it, and change the blade when you feel it start to go dull.&lt;br /&gt;Over all this is a razor thats purfect to learn with then use daily forever.</li>
    <li> Never gets clogged like all the \\&quot;fancy\\&quot; new double, triple and \\&quot;quatro\\&quot; razors. The blades are super cheap (and can be recycled if taken to a metal recycling center) and the (merkur blades) last FOREVER, I shave 2-3 times a week and an on my third blade over the course of a year.</li>
    <li> I tried this razor for the first time to time today (05/04/2010). This was first time in my life trying to shave with a DE razor. It went pretty well. No nicks, cuts, or razor burn. I switched from using a Mach 3 which I have been using the same handle since 2003. Quality of the Merkur razor seems to be pretty good so far. The weight of the entire razor is a little heavier than what I currently own, which I like. I wish the Handle was a little heavier though, because the razor seems a little top heavy. Good thing I did research on these types of razors before, and found out how to open this up to put the blade in. The reason for that was there was no instructions on how to put in the blade. It was very simple to take apart and insert the Merkur Blade that came with it, and reassemble. The length of the handle was great for me.</li>
    <li> After 25 years of shaving with electic and disposables...no more. This razor is of very good quality, one of the main reasons I chose it was becasue of the two piece design, I considered the butterfly style but worried about the blade moving due to the design. whether that fear is justified or not I do not know. The razor just feels good in the hand, good weight balance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get just as close a shave as with the most expensive disposable, it does how ever take twice as long to shave. The strange part is that I actually enjoy shaving now, go figure! I think it is because this style of razor forces one to slow down and take onbe&#x27;s time and it relaxes you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, for the price of one Mach3 package at Costco that may last 3 months, this razor ($29 plus 100 pack of blades $12) will last me close to two years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a beginner, listen you will have to learn how to shave with this style of razor, go with the grain on first pass, then against on subsequent passes etc. Short versus long strokes and so on but you will not regret it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying this razor. The grip texture of the shaft keeps the razor firmly in hand, even when it&#x27;s wet, and it&#x27;s weight allows me to make smooth, even strokes across my skin with minimal effort and force. The blade secures perfectly with the handle screwed in, so there is no wobbling at all. Great razor. Note that only one Merkur blade is included, so I&#x27;d suggest ordering additional blades of your choosing if you don&#x27;t have any on hand.</li>
    <li> A wet shavin fantic for quite a few years, Merkur razors are hands down the finest in the world. I own all of them ( I collect razors both DE and straight edge) and started of with the Merkur 180 Barber Pole which is pretty much the same as the 12C.If you&#x27;re new to the art of old fashioned wet shaving - or just would like yo experiance the better shave of a DE razor there&#x27;s no better model to start you off than this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving with the Merkur 180 will teach you a lot about angles and finding the sweet spot for balance and so on. It&#x27;s much like shaving with a cartridge razor so it&#x27;s very forgiving of mistakes and should be able to shave nic free. However much of this depends on the blades you use. I love Merkur Razors but theire blades are just awful - dull and horrible edges. Pick up some Blue Crystal or Feather blades for an effortless shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like all Merkur razors this is a simply gorgeous instrument, it&#x27;s not to big like the HD series, it&#x27;s wonderfully crafted and there&#x27;s an immediate elegance to it.  Simply let the weight of the razor do the work and you&#x27;ll get one of closest and best shaves you&#x27;ve ever had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I was to knit pick the only thing I could say is that the open comb fills up very fast and you need to give the razor a good swish after just one pass on each side. Without hesitation I would recommend this razor to anyone - along with the advice of using a better quality blade, starting off slow and easy. Let the razor and blade work in unison - and without adding any additional pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give the Merkur 180 a 10!</li>
    <li> I find this ad for the Mercur model 180 long handle safety razor interesting. I am looking at the ad and I have my Pilot Enduro long handle razor with me. They are exactly the same. Can not find the Enduro on Amazon anymore. Can&#x27;t find it anywhere on the internet either. Paid 22 dollars for the Enduro with a pack of 5 Feather blades a while back. Nice heavy razor with an agressive blade angle that gives a good close shave. The Model 180 looks exactly the same, thus I would say that it will not disappoint anyone who buys it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards, Pag</li>
    <li> Best safety razor made hands down. German soligen quality steel. Need I say more?</li>
    <li> Junk. Rough shave. Lots of missed whiskers. Theres a reason why people stopped using these things. Razors have evolved and this is a relic. Try Dorco. Funny name, good razor. Inexpensive refills and a single blade trim edge on the opposite side of the six sided blade.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I&#x27;ve had this for a few months now, and it works great for what I&#x27;m using it for- body hair. I use Feather razors, which are great also. I don&#x27;t use this often for my face, but that&#x27;s just because of how I shave. I generally use a multi-bladed razor for my face and chest, and the Merkur for almost everywhere else. Even then, each blade lasts me a week and a half to two weeks. Much closer shave, and much easier to use than the multi-bladed razors. Just know that you must be careful, and go slow until you have the hang of it. A nick with this WILL bleed worse than a normal razor. Even still, this glides much better and won&#x27;t catch nearly as easily as other razors.</li>
    <li> After a decade of ingrown hairs, skin irritation, and razor bumps with cartridge razors I will never turn back! I have tried double, triple, four, and even five bladed razors (disposable razors and cartridge razors) I can now say that my face is happy!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my father for Christmas. He had been looking for a real razor, not the cheap throw away kind. He&#x27;s thanked me several times, saying its the best shave he&#x27;s had in a long time. Fantastic product. If I wasn&#x27;t rocking a beard, I would get one for myself. If you want a great shave, this is what you need.</li>
    <li> This razor provides the best combination of comfort and closeness that I have found in a razor. Of course, much of your experience will depend on the blades you choose, but I have found this razor to be awesome. It feels very heavy in your hand, making it easy to glide across your face. Also, the longer handle helps when controlling the blade. Overall this is a wonderful, versatile razor that is likely to last a very long time. Great low-cost investment as far as safety razors go. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> THIS RAZOR IS A COMBINATION OF WHAT ALAN RICKMAN&#x27;S VOICE AND RAMMSTEINS MUSIC IS MADE OF. TOUGH, SEXY, SLEEK, GERMAN AND METAL. Will buy again. 10/10</li>
    <li> I am new to the wet shaving scene(2 months). I first bought the Feather Popular Razor and liked it. Didn&#x27;t love it. Wanted to try this one. WOW! What a great razor. Merkur blades are great. Try this one if you are looking. You will be pleased.</li>
    <li> Shaving is definitely more enjoyable with this old fashioned gem, and I&#x27;m getting a closer shave than I was with my old Gillette fusion. I&#x27;ve since moved on to a Merkur Futur adjustable to get a more aggresive shave, but I still use this one at least once a week. I found a trick to get a more aggresive shave out of this razor since it&#x27;s not adjustable. If you buy half single edge blades that fit into a straight razor shavette (like Shark half razors) or simply cut your DE blade in half, then place both halves inside of the razor. This causes the sides of the blade to stick out a little further for a more agressive closer shave, and also makes it easier to get those hard to reach places such as under the jawline. The razor holds both halves of the blade just fine so you don&#x27;t have to worry about the razor moving or falling out. I find that that the feather blades give me the best shave.</li>
    <li> This is a great quality razor that would be &#x27;long handled&#x27; if you have small or medium sized hands.  But,,,if you are tall man with big hands this is not a long handled razor.  And size matters when you are dragging a razor sharp blade across your jugular vein.  Just sayin...</li>
    <li> At first I used cheap disposable razors. Then I upgraded to the double blade. Then the triple. And when the Quattro came out, I thought I found the perfect razor. But the prices were crazy at almost $3 for one refill. This razor is expensive to start, but you can get 100 shark brand refills for about $30. That&#x27;s $0.30 per refill. And it shaves better than anything I used. My face feels as smoth as a naired or waxed leg. If you are cheap and want the smoothest shave available then this is the razor for you.</li>
    <li> I was one of those many guys who use those 5 blade disposable expensive razor burn irritation blades. I bought this razor because I heard that I get a closer shave with this one blade razor. The first time i used this I will admit I was a little apprehensive because I didn&#x27;t know the correct angle. Everything changed for me in one second with the first pass couldnt believe how sharp and smoothe my face is. I will admit i had to do a few passes over a few places but i think that was because of my neck and it wasnt at the right angle but wow was it worth it. I recommend this to ANYBODY and EVERYBODY who wants a baby smoothe face you cant go wrong. Plus my fiance loves the closeness and how much i am saving by not buying those short life 5 blades. This will defanitlly give you a new outlook on shaving you wont mind spending an extra few minutes shaving. 10 STARS</li>
    <li> I have used every disposable razor available and several electrics, and the DE safety is by far the best.  If you are looking for a quick 3-5 min shave in the morning this may not be the razor for you. If you have 10 min or more and even better, the ability to shave in the shower, this razor is amazing!! As many of the reviews will tell you, there is a learning curve to using a DE razor and some spots on your face may be tricky in the beginning, but give it a few shaves and you will see the difference.  I now only shave 3-4 times a week because the shave is so close.  I also use shave oil (shave secret) not a cheap gel or foam.  I haven&#x27;t tried a natural soap but that may be my next step to master the DE razor.  Do a little research and learn the correct way to use the DE razor, many websites out there, and see if you don&#x27;t have the best shave ever.</li>
    <li> Picking this up for the first time, you realize how incredibly heavy it is. This thing looks like it will last forever. My Gillette feels like a toy compared to this one. It is not hard at all to shave with a safety razor and the learning curve is not steep at all. This will be something I will keep for a long time because of its simplicity and cheap blades. The Gillette was costing me almost $2 per cartridge which is ridiculous. I switched a few months ago and haven&#x27;t looked back.</li>
    <li> My husband has wanted a razor like this for years. It was one gift that he was thrilled to receive. Quality razor with a beautiful chrome finish.</li>
    <li> Switching to the Merkur Model 180 has been a life saver for my face.  It was a learning curve to teach myself how to shave with a safety razor but as I learn the experience keeps getting better and better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the switch to anyone struggling with their overprices cartridge based razors.  I was using a Mach 3 prior switching and the single blade of the Merkur is giving me a far closer shave than all the blades in the Mach 3 ever did</li>
    <li> The Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor is everything the maker advertises it is; it is very high quality, German made, chromed plated steel, shaves beautifully.  I purchased it for my 17 year old son.  He had borrowed my Merkur razor which I had purchased over 35 years ago.  He noticed it shaved much better than the popular brand disposables.  So, I bought him one and he loves it.  This razor you will pass to your grandchildren.  They are that good. The blades are still available at most drugstores and Walmart, Freds, etc., and they are generally inexpensive; a couple of bucks for a pack of ten.</li>
    <li> This razor is for beginners or ladies, is it not aggressive, it is like having a Merkur Futur on the #1 setting and not being able to change it.</li>
    <li> I have had this razor for two months (I used to use one like this many years ago).  This razor gives a great shave, but only if you don&#x27;t rush the shave and don&#x27;t use a lot of pressure during the shave.  Let the weight of the razor do the job.  Once I learned to not use a lot of pressure when shaving, I got a very close shave....without any cuts or scrapes.</li>
    <li> I purchased my first Merkur Razor over a year ago and have used it ever since. Simple design and great functionality, it has yet to let me down. I purchased this second razor as a gift for a friend.   Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> Bought this razor in February 2009, for my first ever safety razor.  In 2009, I was converting from the Mach3 to wetshaving, so this razor started me on my path.    After the 3 years of using it the razor is still in fantastic condition.  Holding the razor, the feel of it is wonderful.  It&#x27;s easy to clean and put in new razors.</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just my shaving skills or maybe it&#x27;s my skin but i have very little luck getting a better shave with the Merkur Safety Razor compared to Mach 3 razors.  Yes, i tried taking my time and keeping the blade at 30 degrees AND shaving with the grain and not against the grain(which is has always worked best for me) but no luck.  Does anyone have any suggestions?  I&#x27;m considering selling it on Ebay or Amazon if i can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;edit: I give it five starts now after the prior 2 stars. I just tried the Feather Razor Blades and they are a quantum leap over the Merkur Razor blades.  In fact, i&#x27;d say it&#x27;s pointless to try the Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor without the Feather Razor Blades.  No longer planning on selling this item on Ebay anymore.  You were right on Erik.  Thx!</li>
    <li> This was the first DE razor that I bought (based on the reviews). While it has a nice heft and feel, the razor was too aggressive for me, even after experimenting with different blades. I ended up setting it aside and getting a Gillette \\&quot;Black Beauty\\&quot;, which is an adjustable razor, which works much better for me.  If you like a more aggressive razor, I&#x27;d recommend the Merkur: it&#x27;s a well-balanced and beautiful machine. It just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this back in July.  I did some reading and found that this was a good brand razor and should yield good results shaving.  I was tired of the 5 blade disposables that just stunk for me.  When I got it, I was a bit surprised that all the directions were in German, so it did take me a little to \\&quot;figure\\&quot; out the safety and how to actually shave.  Once i realizes you unscrew the handle and then remove the safety guard, I was on my way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving with this is very easy and takes a little getting used to, but not too hard.  I find that I get a closer shave and do not have to shave as often as I did before.  One tip I have is that you need to be sure to remove the blade after shaving and clean and completely dry the blade before you store it.  I had one that I left partially wet and it rusted.  Nobody wants to shave with a rusty blade.  Besides that, It has been a great razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to safety razors, but I noticed the superiority of the Merkur immediately. If you only need to shave once or twice a week, this isn&#x27;t a big deal. But if you&#x27;re sporting a five o&#x27;clock shadow three hours after you&#x27;ve shaved, this is a life changer. I also bought a decent shave kit with mug, soap and badger brush, and am convinced all of these tools help in producing an excellent shave. I previously used the battery-operated Fusion, and was convinced that nothing could compete with it. How little I knew.   One bit of advice here, though. The soap and brush play a significant role in achieving a great shave. They&#x27;re not just components of some loss leader marketing plan. It&#x27;s kind a long story, but on the first day I ended up not using the Merkur. But even with the shave soap and the Fusion, I got the best shave of my life. Then the next time I shaved I used the Merkur soap, which produced incomparable closeness. I&#x27;m never going back to cannister shave cream or the expensive, disposable razors. Maybe when I&#x27;m travelling or something I&#x27;ll be willing to resort to that. But overall, I&#x27;m done plunking down good money every month because the cartridges have more than one blade.    As other reviews have mentioned, all you need is one blade, a steady hand, and some patience. Do yourself a favor and invest in a good razor and kit. You&#x27;ll make up the money within 3 or 4 months.</li>
    <li> If it&#x27;s not broken don&#x27;t fix it. Talk about practical and efficient. Stainless steel construction means no rust and easy to maintain. Four parts in total including the razor blade. The only &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; would be the brand of razors you buy. I recommend &amp;#34;perssona&amp;#34;. I believe it&#x27;s 100 razors for like under 20 bucks. If you compare it to modern razors its a steal. Good product.</li>
    <li> I really really got tired of the &amp;#34;BLADE RACE&amp;#34;, wherein the manufacturers of Razors would keep  adding more blades and features (and PRICE) to their products. I looked and saw and remembered these &amp;#34;Safety Razors&amp;#34; from my father&#x27;s day back in the 1950&#x27;s when I was young. I recalled using injector razors where a single blade was injected into the razor, and then I looked at the prices. The newer cartridges ran $2-$4 each. expected to last less than a month. Safety Razors as inexpensive as $0.30 each in small quantities. I purchased a sample pack with 60 blades for $22.00 delivered. I am very happy with this and also purchased a 100 count pack of personna blades (under $13.00).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shave in the shower and use a lather mad with &amp;#34;Castile&amp;#34; soap (Dr. Bronner&#x27;s, available on amazon) which is very gentle and makes a great lather. I don&#x27;t use a shaving brush to lather up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave is better than the throw away cartridges. Some of the blades don&#x27;t last very long, but make up for it by being so inexpensive. The Description says, &amp;#34;Long handle - great for people with large hands&amp;#34;, well, that&#x27;s me Glove size 3XL or 2XL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, search for and buy an &amp;#34;alum block&amp;#34;, look up what its for on google, you&#x27;ll thank yourself for purchasing this or other Safety Razor, Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Soap, a Sample Pack of Safety Razor Blades and an Alum Block.</li>
    <li> As a dude who has been using inferior electric shavers since the beginning of my shaving career, and was never taught to shave, I was really nervous about buying this thing. I kept thinking I would sever my jugular or something. But I went ahead and bought it, and boy am I happy I did. I really cant say enough about this masterpiece. I just watched some videos online about safety razors (how to shave, the dos and don&#x27;ts, and so on) and gave it a go myself. It still amazes me how it glides over the skin and doesn&#x27;t pull at all. It really is a great buy, and the coolest thing is I haven&#x27;t even come close to cutting myself yet.</li>
    <li> Actually need to go through 3 of them till I got one that had been chrome plated ok, the one I settled for has a minimal defect on it too however. The prior ones had blemishes in plain sight that should not be present on a $30 razor. I don&#x27;t feel the quality is as good as it should be at this price.   The razor itself works well, with some good blades it will be cheaper in the long run compared with my mach3 for sure. I have quite a thick, heavy beard growth and I do need to shave over the same area at least 3 times to get a very smooth shave. It does take longer that my prior shaver but I do enjoy the time I take to shave in the old fashioned way. Reading J. Peg&#x27;s review, I think I would echo many of his thoughts on this product.  I do get razor burn with this since I have to go over areas on my face multiple times and at alternate angles and directions. I&#x27;ve tried oils and balms but I can&#x27;t spend my whole morning shaving!  I would give this 3.5/5; next time I buy a razor I will also look at Edwin-Jagger, supposed to be very well made from reviews rather than follow the Merkur bandwagon that seems to be happening.</li>
    <li> If you are like me, you switched to a safety razor because you were tired of paying so much for cartridges.  While this razor does take some getting used to (still occasionally nicking myself), it feels good in the hand and the shave is clean.  So long as you aren&#x27;t scared of a bit of a learning curve, I highly recommend trying it out.</li>
    <li> When so-called \\&quot;disposable\\&quot; razors started costing me and arm and a leg, I resolved to find a solution.  I would buy new razors for between $10-15 (after tax), only to find that they don&#x27;t last very long and then you&#x27;re forced to buy more.  It really blows when you&#x27;re spending $25, or more per month on shaving!  I tried buying a straight razor, thinking, \\&quot;why not?\\&quot;  It was good enough for my Grandfather.  But, there is quite a learning curve associated with using a straight razor, not to mention the initial cost (between $100-200 for good, quality equipment).  Then, I remembered the old Merkur razors my dad used to use.  I found them here on Amazon and ordered this one. Voila!  What a difference!  This is a fine quality razor and the one that came was actually a little different from the one pictured; fancier, in my opinion. The weight of the razor does all of the work and gives a beautiful shave for mere pennies!  One razor blade last about 4-5 days with my beard&#x27;s texture and I bought 100 blades for $11.  Do the math.  Almost two years worth of shave for the intial cost and then $11?  Now, that&#x27;s a great deal.  Get one; you won&#x27;t be dissapointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s: quality, inexpensive (after inital cost), will last a lifetime, shaves beautifully, rinses and cleans easily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s: initial cost, some might find the handle too short</li>
    <li> Best shave of my life (with a little practice)</li>
    <li> Not butterfly head and only one blade.  Does not give a close shave.</li>
    <li> Updated review: OK, I was being unfair.  It&#x27;s not this companies fault I don&#x27;t know how to shave with a non-plastic razor. You don&#x27;t take one of these and press it hard against your face like you do with a plastic razor. It has a weighted head. Just sit it on your face and pull downward. Also, since the replacement blades are cheap, you can keep this nice and clean. This is a good product, that requires a small amount of careful practice to begin with.   Old review below, even if I am a bit ashamed of it.  &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;  It simply isn&#x27;t a &amp;#34;safety razor&amp;#34; like you are probably used to.  It&#x27;s using the old term, meaning that this device is much safer than the old straight razor that people used to accidentally cut their heads off with.  The expensive plastic disposable head razors you buy in the store are lighter, more maneuverable and much, much safer.  This thing cut me numerous times, and after the last cut got infected I called it a sunk cost and threw it away (not true, I threw it in the back of me drawer).  You simply must be very very careful every time you use this, or it will cut a chunk of skin off.  It&#x27;s very difficult to shave right under the nose because the head of this razor is so thick.</li>
    <li> The Merkur razor holder is pretty solid -- just resist the temptation to screw it down very tightly (if the screw snaps off, you&#x27;re up that proverbial creek without a rowing implement).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the shave is 80% in the razor, so make sure to start off with a variety pack. I bought a 100-pack of a highly rated safety razor and it seems to pretty easily carve up my face. Blades will differ in the angle of approach and your particular facial elasticity will mean there&#x27;s an optimal out there, so look for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers,</li>
    <li> Nice solid razor, reminds me of my first razor back in boot camp in 1976.  Gives a great shave, and glad I am shifting back to this type of razor, well worth the price.  Have now been using this razor for a few days, and love it!  The solid feel in the hand is great, again, now I remember why when I first started shaving at boot camp in 1976 I was always cutting myself, you have to use it carefully, have nicked myself only because of my own actions, the razor does a fantastic job.  Only drawback is that you have to unscrew the top portion to insert the razor blade, the top does not pivot like other razors, but that is so minor that the use greatly out weighs that.  Also, I unscrew it a bit to rinse and let dry to ensure a clean razor and that it has air to totally dry.  All in all, I am so glad that I went back to this type of razor and am now using Col Conk&#x27;s shaving soap and a Tweezerman badger hair brush, it gives such a close shave, no doubt this is better than the current market multi blade razors!</li>
    <li> This great razor, and the blades for it are very inexpensive like a $1.50 at the Post exchange where I shop. Try getting that kind of deal with a Gillette fusion!</li>
    <li> AFTER YEARS OF INGROWN HAIRS, I WENT TO MY DERMATOLOGIST WHO GAVE ME A CREAM AND SAYS THERE WAS NOT MUCH SHE COULD DO BECAUSE SHE CAN NOT CHANGE THE FACT THAT I AM PRE DISPOSED TO GETTING THEM. I GOOGLED WHAT TO DO TO GET RID OF INGROWN HAIRS AND A SAFETY RAZOR CAME UP. I WAS UNSURE AND HAD PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT OF THEM AS BEING ARCAIC SINCE MY OWN GRANDFATHER NO LONGER USES THEM. I WAS DESPERATE AND ORDERED WHAT MANY WEBSITES HAD RECOMENDED, MERKUR. IT ARRIVED QUICKLY AND I HAD NOT SHAVED FOR ABOUT TWO WEEKS TO REALLY GET A FEEL FOR IT. I SHOULD HAVE FILMED IT BECAUSE I WAS AMAZED, FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER I SHAVED WITHOUT GETTING ANY IRRITATION OR RAZOR BURN. THE HAIR CAME OFF EASILY AND QUICKLY AND I GOT THE HANG OF USING THIS PRODUCT QUICKLY. THIS IS AMAZING AND I DON&#x27;T THINK I WILL EVER USE A \\&quot;NORMAL\\&quot; RAZOR AGAIN. I NOW HAVE A SILKY SMOOTH FACE AND AM SAVING A CRAP TON OF MONEY. TIME WILL TELL ONCE THE HAIRS GROW BACK IN BUT THE SHAVE ALONE AND THE CLOSENESS AND COMFORT OF IT IS WORTH THE PRICE. VERY EASY TO USE, YOU MUST ANGLE IT DIFFERENTLY THAN A PLASTIC RAZOR BUT ONCE YOU GET THE RIGHT ANGLE YOU JUST GENTLY GLIDE IT ACROSS YOUR FACE AND IT GOES WITHOUT ANY EXTRA PRESSURE. THANK YOU GOOGLE, THANK YOU MERKUR AND THANKS AMAZON!!! -- A 22 YEAR OLD MALE WHO IS SHAVING IN STYLE AND COMFORT.</li>
    <li> Been shaving for 50 years.  Finally got tired of the four and five bladed safety razors, as the replacement blades are too expensive.  If you really want a clean shave, treat yourself to a brush, shaving soap and the above razor.  I must say I  look forward to  shaving.  It has been a nice experience.  Obviously the German razor is made very well and worth every penny.  Consider this, a package of 100 blades is about $10.  If I change a blade two times a week, I don&#x27;t buy blades for a year.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s and can still recall my dad shaving with a Gillette DE back when dinosaurs roamed the planet. In fact, it was just such a razor that I learned to shave with when the peach fuzz turned into a real beard.    Over the years, I&#x27;ve used every \\&quot;new and improved\\&quot; model from Gillette and even a Schick product or two. The end came with I tried the Gillette Fusion and felt like my pocket was being picked every time I bought a pack of cartridges. That&#x27;s when I moved to a Braun electric.    It&#x27;s been about 2.5 years that I&#x27;ve been using the Braun and have never been 100% satisfied with the shave I get. Don&#x27;t get me wrong. For an electric, it gives a pretty darned good shave. But, the qualifier \\&quot;for an electric\\&quot; says it all.    Back to the days of yore, when men were men and weren&#x27;t afraid of a sharp piece of steel or felt that they needed 5 pieces of steel to get a close shave. C&#x27;mon guys, we&#x27;ve been hoodwinkied, bamboozled and just plain ripped off by all the hype Gillette can dish out.    It took me a couple of days to get back into the swing of shaving with a DE, but a few drops of blood are no big deal to a real man! Seriously, I had forgotten what a really close shave felt like and I&#x27;m not going back to the Braun unless I&#x27;m late for work.    By the way, I&#x27;m using Merkur blades right now and they seem to be fine. I&#x27;ll probably try one or two other brands just to see the difference, but I can&#x27;t imagine anything much better.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and I was happy with how it worked in my shave routine. If your looking to get into safety razor shaving this is recommended. I bought this as my first single blade razor and love shaving with it now everyday. Buy quality and enjoy it.</li>
    <li> I always feel the need to qualify my reviews when I&#x27;ve got no basis for comparison. This is the first and only safety razor I&#x27;ve used. My wife bought me this long-time resident of my Amazon Wishlist as part of my 30th birthday gift. I love it. I&#x27;ve been wanting to get into wet shaving for quite a while, and this has been the perfect razor so far.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver for my father who is very traditional and he just loved it!    Most important was the delivery time, since my father would travel in two days and I was distressed that the product has not arrived. But it came exactly on the day promised.    Excellent quality and competence in services. Sure, I will recommend to my friends!</li>
    <li> My husband didn&#x27;t like it.  Takes too long to shave.  When he has time, he will use it once in a while and it give a good shave.</li>
    <li> I was initially weary about jumping in to using a safety razor after only ever using cartridge razors.  However, I have been extremely satisfied with the ease and quality of shave I obtain with the Merkur safety razor.  There is a small learning curve, however, I find that I experience much less irritation from shaving.  The razor itself is extremely well built and will no doubt last for many years.  Further, there is a tremendous cost savings from using razor blades versus cartridge razors.  I recommend this razor highly.  If I had to buy it again, I might consider the shorter handled version (the shave action is different than I anticipated and the shorter handle is really all you need).</li>
    <li> First dive into the shaving past was a $10 one that turned out to be plastic. Actually, it worked fine, though I am sure the plastic blade locking device has a short life.  Once I was convinced this was the way to go I got the Merkur 180 and all the trimmings. Without the rickety trap door mechanisms I remember that rusted eventually, this one seemed solid, almost heirloom quality.  I have since read of the screw breaking in the head which attaches the head to the handle.  The manufacture recommends cleaning every time to prevent corrosion caused by water sitting on it. This seems impractical.  I&#x27;ve already added 3 minutes to my shaving time every day, now take it apart completely, clean and dry and reassemble? No way. That means handling the blade every day, too, and I&#x27;d rather not, thank you.&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest, though, that choosing the the 180 over the shorter, lighter versions over time places more load or stress on that screw than a shorter, lighter mechanism.  I chose the 180 based on a recommendation on some forum, and once I got it, my first impression was that I might have preferred the shorter one anyway.  Despite the size of my hands, I find myself holding it high on the handle for optimum control.  If mine breaks and I go Merkur again, I will opt for the shorter one.  Other option, people suggest is find a stainless steel model.  I&#x27;ll cross that bridge... I&#x27;m very happy with it so far and don&#x27;t see ever going back to the \\&quot;modern\\&quot; option. I look forward to shaving each day. The quality of the shave is night and day better than multi-blade plastic handled money wasters, and I enjoy the ritual.</li>
    <li> I ordered this razor earlier in the month.  I have an original from the 50&#x27;s and thought I would try out the newer version.  I love how inexpensive wet shaving with a DE Safety Razor is, just an initial investment of Razor, Brush, Soap, a good pre-shave oil (I&#x27;m trying out shave secret, works well) and blades (get a variety pack) then get shaving.    I suffered for years from burning and bumps that came with cartridges.  I tried electric - same result, back to wet shaving but with expensive cream and oil with same results.  So I decided to take some direction from the men of old, and boom.  A month in never been more comfortable.  It does take a few attempts at getting the angle right, I like a close shave, but first time I was a little to aggressive (I took a chunk out from under my nose-painful).    If you are interested in a razor/brush stand pick up the gift set.</li>
    <li> Wow, there&#x27;s quite a few people here gushing about how amazing these old fashioned razors are, calling shaving an \\&quot;art form\\&quot; and other nonsense. After many attempts I finally managed to hold this thing at exactly the right angle and get it to shave reasonably smooth. My beard is nowhere near thick and this hunk of overpriced crap still couldn&#x27;t come close to even a cheap single blade disposable.   Terrible design; the head comes apart into two pieces when other designs have flaps that open up. This makes it difficult to change blades without dropping pieces or cutting yourself.  If you&#x27;re a nostalgic old fart or a clueless hipster who thinks a vintage design must be superior, then go ahead and piss away money on this. I personally find shaving to be an annoying fact of modern life that should be dealt with as quickly as possible. Would you use a washboard to clean your clothes because it&#x27;s how people used to do it? Of course not, modern technology seeks to make life better; maybe if I practiced a lot and did all the other things people recommend to make this thing work correctly, I might manage to shave my face in 20 minutes instead of 10 with a modern razor.   And for everyone complaining about how expensive disposable blades are, try sharpening them on the leg of a pair of jeans (or anything denim). I can get months of use out of a single blade that way.</li>
    <li> This is the first safety razor I&#x27;ve ever purchased or used. I&#x27;m glad I did! It gives me a great, close shave, and buying replacement blades is SO MUCH CHEAPER than buying cartridges for my old razor. It did take a little getting used to; I nicked myself a few times at first. But it&#x27;s not at all difficult to use or to change out the blade. Took me about 5 seconds to figure out. I&#x27;m a woman, and I use this on my legs and underarms. I&#x27;m definitely a convert. Wish I&#x27;d known about safety razors much sooner.</li>
    <li> Very useful the few times a year I bother to shave.  Disposables, in addition to being overpriced and wasteful, clog up with hair when an infrequent shaver like myself tried to use them.  Not an issue with this since you can just unscrew the handle a bit to loosed the blade and quickly rinse our the hair.  Anyways, but this and you&#x27;ll never need to by a plastic  POS razor ever again.</li>
    <li> This was second Merkur that I have purchased.  The first one fell and broke where the threaded shaft met&lt;br /&gt;Razor holder.  This was the long handle version and met expectation</li>
    <li> I am not new to shaving but am new to this type of razor. I used to used those 3, 4 and 5 bladed razors but cost way too much and really don&#x27;t stay sharp for very long. Like the other reviewers have stated, this razor has a learning curve but with practice and patience you&#x27;ll enjoy that old fashion way of shaving. Oh, and please be sure to but pre-shave oil and shaving cream. It really makes a big difference.[[ASIN:B000NL0T1G Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor-#180- Made in Germany]]</li>
    <li> Bought this after receiving a recommendation from an acquaintance. Honestly, i don&#x27;t even understand how Gillette and Schick are able to push their multi-bladed crap - this thing is amazing. Never had a better shave. I&#x27;m the kind of guy who shaves with a razor maybe twice-to-thrice a week, and I don&#x27;t use an electric razor. So when I do get around to shaving i&#x27;m removing some growth. My experience with Mach 3 was that it had a break-in shave that was uncomfortable, about two comfortable close shaves, and then the thing was pretty much shot. It wouldn&#x27;t slice me often, but the razor burn was incredibly uncomfortable, enough that I sported a beard for a long while, simply because I disliked shaving so much. I would never shave against the grain, always with downstrokes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t see that it has much of a learning curve like some reviewers have indicated, basically hold it at 30 degree angle (I always did this with a Gillette anyway). Let the weight of the shaving head do the work. The unit has some heft, its not like a plastic razor where you have to do the pulling. It cuts close, but very comfortably, and entirely with the grain, no cross-cutting or upstrokes needed. Using cheap barbasol creme, I had no razor burn. I use the cheap Derby blades that are $8 for 100. I enjoy the shave now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did find that you still get a close shave on the 2nd or 3rd use of the blade, but its propensity to slice you increases from 0 to a couple knicks on the chin. At 100 blades for $8, just throw the blade out after using it the first time. If you are like me and shave with a razor 2 or 3 times a week, you&#x27;re still getting nearly a year&#x27;s worth of shaves for $8 - compare to paying over $30 for a year&#x27;s supply of Mach 3 blades, plus all the assorted after-shave balms you&#x27;ll need to combat the chronic razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly, highly recommend. I&#x27;m like a Merkur groupie now, I tell all my (hirsute) friends about it.</li>
    <li> The quality... you can feel it in your hand. The weight, design, and look of this product is amazing. I felt like a real man shaving for once when I first shaved with this razor. I did cut myself a couple of times being a newbie, but I&#x27;ve gotten used to the pressure differences. Every time I shave now I love the way my face feels. Rinsing it under a facet is so easy compared to those stupid gilette triple blades where the hairs get stuck between the blades and you have to try to get them out - not the Merkur! I will never ever ever go back to shaving the way I did before. I haven&#x27;t even used my electric razor since I bought this, it is that good. And with better and more economical blades, best investment ever. You&#x27;re going to be shaving for the rest of your life, why not start now?</li>
    <li> 2nd one I have purchased and I would buy more for gifts.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my chest and stomach. I did use it for my face. It worked well. But to me, it&#x27;s not worth the prep time. Shave soap and all. I still like the regular shave gel and multi razor. I used it on my stomach and chest. But realized the wahl peanut was very effective. Short cut very fast. Just my opinion. Thanks.</li>
    <li> The whole head has to screw off to change the blade, which makes for a dicey procedure early in the morning.  If you&#x27;re wanting the kind where the base of the handle opens the top for safe insertion of the blade, this razor is NOT the one you want to buy.  German engineering missed the boat on this one...</li>
    <li> My only complaint is one that Pavlov might invoke, and not a flaw with the razor, rather a flaw with the user. My old butterfly razor would stand on end, as it had a flat spot where the two sides came together. This one is perfectly rounded, and does not. I spent the first 4-5x picking it up off the tile floor, attempting the same rote practice as with my old one. This leads me to a quality point - As I said it has dropped the 36&amp;#34; to the tile floor 4-5x and not one drop has caused a problem. I purchased a stand and no more problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will take some getting used to cleaning and swapping blades. Where I as previously able to replace blades in two steps without setting any part of the razor down, this one is a four step process. Again, not a flaw, but a practices change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had the top come loose a couple times, which I expect is from not assembling it with the proper twist pressure. If it starts to loosen up, you will know it quickly.</li>
    <li> I bought a knockoff razor after this one to use for travel, and this thing is actually worth the much higher price. Consistent setting of the blade and good, heavy feel. I bought this DE razor and have not gone back to Gillette since. You definitely need to be a little more careful, but the shave is better and the razors cost as low as $0.10 each! I cannot believe how expensive Gillette blades are these days.</li>
    <li> Gift for husband.  He has been using an early 1920&#x27;s razor he inherited from his grandfather, and he loves the shave he gets with this razor.</li>
    <li> My goal in life is to buy only &#x27;quality&#x27; products when needed... This means I will refrain from buying products from USA, China, or some other backwards country,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;German products such as this are truly superior to any else in today&#x27;s disappointing market...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;German &#x3D; Built to last with superior quality and engineering.</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s the scoop, do your research before you buy. Simple advice to take&lt;br /&gt;I love this razor and DE shaving compared to disposable cartridges&lt;br /&gt;One thing I&#x27;ve learned is you do not press down hard when shaving like you do with a cartridge type razor, let the blade do the work. It&#x27;s that simple!  Read and research about DE shaving and you will wonder why you didn&#x27;t switch years ago. This handle is great for guys with large hands and it works like a charm</li>
    <li> This razor does exactly what it should.  I switched from another safety razor about a month ago, and in that time, no cuts or razor burns.  The long handle is nice for my larger hands.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with the Merkur Model 180 long handled safety razor coupled with the Merkur blades for four years, and it is truly a joy to shave with!  I am able to shave every day with this razor if I want to, though every other day is plenty frequent, and I usually shave just twice a week.  I have a lot of facial hair, and it grows quickly, and the Merkur handles it well.  My skin is happy!  I used to use some Gillette multi-bladed (3 or 4, I forget) razor, which my neck did not appreciate very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried carrying the Merkur in my bag when I go through airplane security, and it&#x27;s hit or miss whether they will make you toss the blade.  I&#x27;ve just accepted not shaving as part of my travel routine.  Though I think with the recent change in TSA rules, you may be able to bring the blade aboard - at least for domestic travel.</li>
    <li> Have been using it for a while. It gets a long time to get used to this if you have never used safety razor.</li>
    <li> Best quality, shaves better than cartridge razors. Blades are inexpensive, and easy to find. I love it!</li>
    <li> Great fit and feel, this is a high quality straight razor. I ordered the variety pack of razor blades (I heard mixed reviews about which gives the best shave). Yes, the blades are slightly different, but generally the same. All-in-all this is a huge step up from the three or four blade razors.</li>
    <li> It delivers such as close shave. I will never go back to cartridges. Now I just need a stand and the special soap to go with it.</li>
    <li> The Merkur 180 is a great razor. The long handle gives excellent grip and ballance. It&#x27;s a pleasure to shave with as it glides across the skin. I use mine with derby blades and Col. Conk&#x27;s shave soap and am very pleased.</li>
    <li> This was the first of 3 Merkur razors I have purchased - this one I purchased for my husband. We had a small fortune invested in the Mach razors - which never really worked except for the first shave. A few minor nicks the first few times he used it, but quickly got the hang of it and it gives him a very close, non-irritating shave (we also use natural goats milk soap rather than chemical \\&quot;shaving cream\\&quot;). Then I purchased one for my teenage son (it&#x27;s the one just like this one, only with a short handle). He loves it, too. I purchased the 1904 replica for myself - I figured if it worked so well for the guys, it might work great for the girls. And it does. Nice close shave without stripping my skin. Respect the razor, know the proper way to use a safety-razor and you will never want to go back to those other things again.     The short-handled razors are great for my small hands, but a man with large hands would probably prefer the long-handled razor (which is about the same length as a Mach razor). Also, the 1904 one has \\&quot;open\\&quot; teeth whereas this one does not. To me, both types give just as close a shave - I see no difference (neither does my husband). Perhaps those who allow their beard/hair to grow longer before they shave might find a difference.</li>
    <li> Hard to believe a razor could make such a difference. I started out with a Parker 22R butterfly razor and hated it, blade was always loose and when finished shaving I looked like I was atttacked by a slasher. Was thinking of going back to the fusion power but thought I would give this Merkur a try. The difference is night and day compared to the Parker brand, it feels much better in the hand and the shave is awesome! I&#x27;ve not had one nick since using the Merkur. If you are thinking of buying a new razor go with the Merkur. I&#x27;ve been using it with Derby blades and very happy, now!</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve used Gillette razors for my entire shaving life and I thought that was as good as it gets. I was wrong. The Merkur safety razor is so much better I wish I had never even used those Mach 3s, 4s, 5s. etc.  First, the replacement razors are incredibly cheap compared to replacement razors for Gillette razors. I got a pack of 25 replacement razors for under $5 on Amazon whereas Gillette razors were about $5 or more for 3 replacement blades.  Second, the shave I get from this razor is much closer and cleaner compared with the Gillette blade. I always had trouble shaving my neck with Gillette razors because no matter how many passes I made, there would still be stubble. However, with the Merkur razor my neck is super smooth.  Third, you just feel like a total bad ass with this razor.  The only downside is that you will spend more time shaving with this razor compared with an electric or a disposable because you have to be more careful (shorter strokes) and make several passes.</li>
    <li> This Is a great safety razor. It was my first and I decided to go with the reviews. It is easy to hold and comfortable in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;Pro&lt;br /&gt;-Perfect weight&lt;br /&gt;-Perfect length&lt;br /&gt;Con&lt;br /&gt;-Gets hot when you run it under hot water too long. (Cold water cools it quickly)&lt;br /&gt;-Have to be careful to remove the blades. (just use caution where you hold and twist)</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 3 months with flawless results. I wish I would have switched to a saftey razor years ago and ditched the 2, 3, 4 or 5 blade systems long ago... If you have patience and want the closest shave possible this is for you.</li>
    <li> You really can&#x27;t go wrong with this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks good, it&#x27;s MUCH cheaper compared to cartidge razors (you can get good blades and soap for about $5, cartridges are around $30 now) and with good technique most will get close irritation free shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great investment for guys who shave often.</li>
    <li> Read the reviews and was hopeful...bleeding cuts and shave not as good as my existing multi blades were the result. Requires a delicate touch and technique, not good when you are in a hurry.</li>
    <li> My friend is always bleeding after he shaves. I think he&#x27;s just sloppy but I looked up this razor. All the reviews were pretty good so I got it for him. It seemed to give him a smooth shave and then a week later he stopped using it. He said it was too rough on his skin. I think it&#x27;s just because he&#x27;s sloppy but just be careful and slow, because it is a harp blade.</li>
    <li> I gave up on the corporate shaving world, and went with this Merkur razor-stepping off the ledge and taking a long shot.  what did I have to loose??    Well, I found this to be the BEST and most comfortable shave ever!! I matched it with Derby blades, and got 50x better shave than my Gillette Fuzion...      worth every penny! Plus I&#x27;m saving a huge amount of pennys not buying the crappy blades from Gillette!</li>
    <li> Who isn&#x27;t sick of paying 30 dollars for 4 cartridge refills.  The initial investment for this razor is definitely more than that typical 7 dollar gillette or schick handle, but the long term value of purchasing 10 blades for 6 bucks can&#x27;t be beat!  The fact is that this razor provides a close shave and it&#x27;s much simpler to take care of.  Plus when you have 5 or 6 blades, if one gets rusty or dull then if effects the entire cartridge.  Why not worry about keeping one blade clean and dry instead of 5!  I love this razor and can&#x27;t imagine going back to dumping money on the leading razor cartridge refills!  Buy this razor... you won&#x27;t be disappointed!!!</li>
    <li> I am a person whom shave and bump up with what ever tried all typed of razors ., so I&#x27;d decided to do some researching on shaving for afro american skin .and how  to shave . This product came up and with help from youtube  and trying different blades man I am a pro shaver and these razor are the bomb thanks</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing razor..!!!!  We love this thing!!!&lt;br /&gt;We will be buying an extra just in case we ever need it.</li>
    <li> Coming from the popular three blade razors, the difference is extremely noticeable. First, the razor itself isnt too short or too long. It feels natural in the hand. Even when wet it didnt slip once. The shave itself is wonderful - this razor has given me the closet shave Ive ever had. I was worried about cutting myself, but that wasnt even an issue. The only issue I had was slight razor burn on my neck, but that was my fault (I went over the same spot too many times while trying to learn the proper angle). Besides a great shave, you&#x27;ll feel more manly using this razor!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this razor, and will never go back to overpriced, poor performing disposable razors ever again. This razor offers less waste, a closer and more enjoyable shave, and a significant cost savings as opposed to disposables or overpriced cartridges. Also, I used to get alot of ingrown hairs, or razor bumps, but this has almost completely gone away. After reading a few of the reviews here, I was prepared for a few cuts in the beginning due to a learning curve, but after almost a year of using this, I still have yet to cut myself. The razor itself is sturdy, weighted nicely, and simple. I thoroughly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This razor is just amazing. I absolutely love it! Take my word for it, throw your Gillette rip off razor in the garbage and pick one of these up.    I&#x27;ve never had a problem with my gillette razor before.... I use to get a solid 8-10 shaves out of it, but lately I&#x27;ve been getting about 3-4 shaves before its starts ripping my skin apart. Personally, I think they&#x27;re not making their razors as sharp as they use to to increase profits, which would be fine if the razors weren&#x27;t outrageously priced. I mean 42.99 for 18 razors at Costco? COME ON!    I paid $16 and change for 30 blades....30 blades! And let me tell you, i&#x27;ve never, ever had a closer shave.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice Razor but it tears up my skin when I use it continuously, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s cause I have soft sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using a brush and cup for a few years now to get a better quality shave and recently added this little joy to the mix. As with all of the other (positive) reviews, I love it. There was a slight learning curve, figuring out the appropriate angle, but once I had that established it has been a dream....and the wife loves how close it gets, too! It stays smoother far longer than any shave I ever got from a Mach 3...</li>
    <li> As a DE beginner I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase. This device is top quality and most utterly useful! A gentlemen&#x27;s razor. You can tell that this will last multiple lifetimes.  I have dropped it a few times and although it has dinged slightly, because of the way it is forged it doesn&#x27;t lose its awesome finish. Albeit, I do clean it after most shaves, unless I am short on time.  In short, if you&#x27;re doubtful as to which razor to purchase as a first timer or even to have multiple razors, there is no reason why you shouldn&#x27;t own this simple, yet elegant product!  Happy shaving gentlemen!</li>
    <li> First off, I never leave reviews for things unless they are real real good or real real bad.I had read the reviews for this product and thought how great this would be for my boyfriend. He uses clippers, instead of razors to shave b/c his skin is so sensitive. (only when it comes to shaving)Well he warned me what would happen, but I did not listen ( like usual) and Bam! Bumps all over his face. It was terrible. That is the worse it had ever been w any type of razor! Will not give this a good review, bc it was terrible ( for his skin) I now everyone is different, so I will just have to go on that.</li>
    <li> I upgraded from a *name brand that starts with G* razor.  I like the feel of this metal razor better than the plastic of my former one.  As the name implies, it is indeed safe and makes it difficult to cut yourself unless you intentionally swipe the blade to the side.  The rounded head prevents the blade from touching your skin if you are too shallow, and the comb-like teeth prevent the blade from touching your skin if you are too steep.  This is better.</li>
    <li> This was to replace my Mach3 because I was tired of paying $40 for 25 blades.  With this I use the Personna blade pack which has 100 blades and is about $13.  That means I can use a new blade every time I shave and still come out on top cost wise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t come with any directions you have to unscrew the blade head to get it apart and put in your razor blade.  So far so good on this and worth the higher cost of the razor to have dirt cheap blades.  There are so many blades out there (personna, feather, etc) that you can keep mixing and matching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still mastering the art of shaving with this thing but with this and my alum bar to help stop bleeding when I nick the razor bumps I get this is great</li>
    <li> I bought this razor after reading many good reviews for this. I agree with the positive reviews. The handle is easy to grip and does not slip of your hand. It has a good weight the makes the shave real smooth. (Just let the weight do the shaving.) My goal was to get a smoother shave than a Mach 3 and save some money in the process. So far my shaves are clean and smooth. It does take more time to setup up and shave, but it is well worth it. I will not be going back to any other type of razor \\&quot;system\\&quot;. Plus the money savings in buying razors is well worth it.</li>
    <li> Better then those cartridge razors and cheaer</li>
    <li> Short review:  This razor is awesome. Buy it.  Now!    Long review.    I got this product because I was sick of three things:  paying too much for the cartridges, polluting the environment and getting ingrown hairs.  I paid less than $40 for the razor and for the top of the line Merkur blades and I am never going back to any multiblade cartridge system ever again.  Extremely well made Merkur blades run me about 50 cents while my next door general store sells Mach-3 cartridges for around 2.50 dollars per unit. Cheaper blades are available for 9 cents and just the math alone makes this razor a no-brainer.      Then there is the great shave factor.  Merkur blades are quite sharp and you really feel the edge dragging against your skin.  This allows me to change the angle of shave without pressing on the razor like I used to do with Gillette Mach 3.  The fact that there is only one blade makes this razor clog less and I can use thicker shaving creams that add to the quality of shaves. Also one blade means less irritation and my sensitive skin thanks me for that.    Finally, razor blades can be recycled without any issues.  Since the razor is hard to clog I go with heavier shaving creams and soaps that are not coming out of an aerosol bottle. Minimal packaging leads to less pollution. So does the fact that a good brush can reduce the waste of shaving products which now last longer.      Cheap. Reliable. Environment friendly. What else do you need?    I read a review where somebody did not like the razor because it did not offer a good shaving angle.  The person tried to alter the angle by unscrewing the head of the razor -- bad move! This is a non-adjustable razor and it means that for the best results you have to screw the head all the way down. If you&#x27;re looking for an adjustable version of Merkur, they&#x27;re available on Amazon as well.  I appreciate the simplicity of this particular model and that&#x27;s why I did not get an adjustable one.  But check out [[ASIN:B000JPKLUU Merkur Solingen Futur Adjustable Double Edge Safety Razor]] if you want a razor that lets you change the angle of the blade.    Finally, I cannot stress enough the importance of other accessories that will make this razor even more enjoyable.    1. Get shaving soap or think shaving cream. Search for O.C. Bigelow, Taylor of Old Bond Street or Proraso on Amazon. These companies make really terrific shaving creams.  If you like soaps, check out Colonel Conk.  Many of these products costs less than $15 but don&#x27;t be fooled:  They are great.  The Art of Shaving has guts to overcharge for its shaving products but they are not bad either.    2. Invest money in a nice shaving brush.  Too bad Amazon does not offer brushes by Rooney or Vulfix.  A silvertip or super badger will run you for $100+ but it is well worth it.  With proper care it will last for years without shedding.  If you opt for cheaper brands sold at grocery stores or Bath and Body, you&#x27;ll end up replacing them quite soon. Get good stuff from the very beginning and save some money. I know, spending $100 on a shave brush sounds a bit Wall Street in this economy, but the fact is that even with all the investment today you&#x27;ll end up saving money in a long run.     3. Learn how to recycle the blades and get only the best ones you can afford.  Merkur leads the pack for me.    Oh, and welcome to the world of real shaving.  Next step -- straight razors.</li>
    <li> This is kind of a 2 in 1 review for the Merkur &amp; the Feather Blades...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad I did a little research on Amazon to find a better razor.  I was so sick of shelling out money for Mach3 razors.  Gillette is not getting another dollar from me.&lt;br /&gt;This Merkur razor coupled with the Japanese Feather blades are incredible.  I think I got ten razors in a pack for under $4 with free shipping!  Outstanding.  I have also been using the 1st razor I got with the Merkur &amp; it&#x27;s already lasted me about 5 shaves.  Better than Gillette has ever produced, or any other company for that matter.  I am going to save probably thousands of dollars over the years using this &amp; get just as good of a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only minor criticism would be to say that you don&#x27;t get as fast or efficient of a shave than with a Mach 3 blade, but that&#x27;s hardly a complaint.  I guess to put it simply, you can get just as good of a shave, but it will maybe take a few minutes longer.  You have one blade working for you rather than 3, but the blade will last you at least twice as long.  I&#x27;ll take this deal any day over Gillette or the other competitors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These razors will only dull over time, not pit or degrade like Mach 3&#x27;s seem to.  When the Mach 3 would dull I start to get chaffed, red skin &amp; razor bumps.  I&#x27;ve even ended up getting infected follicles a few times.  My skin doesn&#x27;t chafe when these blades start to dull.  It just works a little less efficiently.  I also followed the Merkur directions &amp; didn&#x27;t \\&quot;wipe\\&quot; the blade, but just shook out the excess water &amp; let it air dry.  The blade has lasted quite awhile (I&#x27;d say the equivalent to about 6-7 full face shaves).  I don&#x27;t do full face though.  I like a little stubble, so I just do my neck &amp; high cheek bones to crop my stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, who cares about my routine.  I just wanted to give some detail for anyone that may shave in a similar manner.  I highly, highly recommend these products.  Hope this review helps someone.</li>
    <li> So much better than disposable razors.  Want a closer, cleaner and cheaper shave?  Then try out a safety razor.  It makes shaving a bit more an art and a bit less of a chore.  I like the long handle of this Merkur, it feels a bit more stable than the short handle razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people say that it is difficult to learn how to shave with a safety razor.  So those of you who are tentative, rest assured, it is not that difficult.  A little common sense and you will have a great shave every time.</li>
    <li> This was my first safety razor, and I have to say, it was exactly what I was looking for. Made out of solid metal, with a crosshatch grip and two piece top that screws onto the handle. Easy to use, easy to clean, and built to last forever. I will continue to this razor till I&#x27;m dead, and I would give as a gift to any young man starting his own shaving regiment.</li>
    <li> Since I started shaving at the tender age of 12 I have used various methods of shaving.  I first started out using my dad&#x27;s electric razor but didn&#x27;t like how it pulled hair rather than cut it and I always had stray hairs that were not cut.  I then went with the disposable 2 blade razors when they came out and eventually made the switch in high school to the Mach 3 and then the fusion razor.  I have never been a fan of the shave gel that they tell you works best with those razors and I didn&#x27;t like how bumpy and razor burnt my face felt afterwards.  I have a great deal of Scandinavian blood in me and as a result my beard grows fast, thick and curly.  When I received this razor in the mail yesterday (3/1/2012) I took one look at the razor blade and thought \\&quot;there is no way in hell this razor is going to be able to cut my 5 day old growth.\\&quot;  After trying without success to read the direction on the box (they are in German) I figured out how to detach the handle to put the razor on.  I then lathered my face up with my new brush and shaving cream and put the razor to my face.  Not only did this razor not have any trouble cutting through my beard, it was the closest shave and the most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve had since going to a barber and getting a hot towel shave.  I will never again use the inferior Gillette razors and I&#x27;m actually looking forward to my next shave, rather than avoiding it like I have in the past.  You will not be disappointed with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Since it&#x27;s mostly men who have posted a review, I thought a woman&#x27;s perspective would be helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like a lot of folks, I grew tired of paying for expensive blade cartridges and decided to go back to the future with this Merkur DE safety razor for my woman parts like legs and underarms. I&#x27;m using Feather blades with it. And I&#x27;m so glad I made the change!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now get it when folks say safety razors shave soooo much closer than a multi-blade razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to this specific Merkur razor...I like the long handle on this as well as the grip on the razor. I shave at the end of my shower and my hands are wet. I haven&#x27;t had any problems keeping a light grip on the handle. I&#x27;m still adjusting to wet shaving but, having followed the advice of other experienced wet shavers, I&#x27;ve only had a one small nick since I started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t speak yet about the razor&#x27;s longetivity since I just purchased it but it looks like it&#x27;s well constructed. And I liked it well enough to buy a second to keep in my toiletry kit for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also bought a stand to keep the razor dry between uses and a leather travel pouch so I don&#x27;t have to worry about cutting myself when reaching into my toiletry kit while traveling. All together, 2 Merkur safety razors, 100 blades, the stand, and travel pouch cost me less than the costs of blade cartridges for 1 year. And the blades will last for 1-1/2 to 2 years and the razors for years (decades?) to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a very satisfying purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other folks have commented about needing to make adjustments to how you shave like no putting pressure on the razor, etc. Make sure you watch some videos or read some blog articles about the right way to wet shave. Although I learned how to shave with this style razor, I needed the refresher. Rather than use shaving cream, I&#x27;m using hair conditioner and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does take me a little longer to wet shave but that may be because I&#x27;m beingultra careful as a once again new wet shaver. But really for me it&#x27;s only about 5 or so extra minutes and it&#x27;s definitely worth the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll never go back to blade cartridges again.</li>
    <li> This product has an overwhelmingly large number of reviews that are gushing and overly positive, but when you actually read them you find things like \\&quot;Wow this gets closer than my old electric razor I haven&#x27;t shaved with a blade in years but this is fantastic shaving with safety razor is great\\&quot; or \\&quot;this is technically more frugal because blades themselves are so cheap so after the intro price...\\&quot; and of course \\&quot;I&#x27;m 19 years old with a thin patchy beard and I just tried this thing and it works great!\\&quot; Now there isn&#x27;t anything inherently wrong with what a lot of the reviewers here are saying  but they don&#x27;t tell you anything about the blade itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I go on to write what will likely go on to be a wordy, potentially rambling review of this product I&#x27;d like to just tell you what I think about this product. For the price there are better razors out there. For a few dollars less you can get a higher quality parker unit that opens up from the top instead of requiring you to take the entire head off and looks better, and personally I found it gave a slightly better shave. So the early summary is if you want to get this because \\&quot;well merkur does sound familiar as an old timey razor company\\&quot; then skip it or maybe try something more expensive, personally I haven&#x27;t tried those out yet because, as I said earlier most reviews on these razors are useless thanks to people just gushing over how they&#x27;ve never shaved this way before instead of actually reviewing the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway onto the detailed nitpicking about this device. The first problem you&#x27;ll run into with this blade is you have to take apart the entire head in order to insert the blade. It takes a few times to get used to doing this properly, but even when you do it&#x27;s still a bit of a clumsy procedure. It&#x27;s a bit cheap of the blade to be build this way instead of the usual way of twisting the handle and letting the top open up allowing for easy replacement of the blades. Overall it&#x27;s a bit cheapon the manufacturers part and there are cheaper razors on this very site that offer the butterfly hinge on the head of the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another problem with the quality of the bottom lip of the device. It&#x27;s the safety part of a safety razor and it&#x27;s what keeps you from chopping little chunks of flesh off of your face, but this particular razor just has it too long, too thick, and the opening for the blade itself is a little bit too tight. The end result is that it takes a lot more effort to get an actual close shave. Trying to adjust the opening only leads to loosening the entire unit and letting it slide around and cult up your face and I know you have to hold it at an angle but my beard hairs are dark, thick, and they keep low to my face. I have managed to get a close shave with this, but it was with feather blades and great effort that I managed to do it. My new parker has a similar problem without being adjustable but it&#x27;s at least a bit better at getting close than this ever was. In the end if you want a good shave skip this and move onto something else.</li>
    <li> This is my first DE razor and I can definitely see what all the hype is about.  The razor looks great and works great - all the other glowing reviews are right.</li>
    <li> Shaving with this is much simpler than using those ridiculous and expensive safety razors. Good bye to the latest flavors of Gillette and Schick. I&#x27;m saving a lot of money and the shaving experience is much better. The Merkur feels great in your hand and the weight does all the work for you, you just have to find the right angle to use which is simple enough. This is a purchase I will never regret.</li>
    <li> I am pissed I shaved for ten years with mach3 razors.  This you thing makes shaving enjoyable!  Buy one you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> It was just what my husband imagined it would be. After years of disposable razors, he is one happy man.</li>
    <li> bought this for my brother in law. that being said, he is very meticulous in the research he dose before a purchase. in short if he wants this product, theres a reason. he LOVES IT by the way.</li>
    <li> This was my first double edge safety razor, great looking razor, works well, medium aggressiveness. But be warned!!!!  I now have over 30 new and vintage double edge safety razors in my posession. If you are one given to compulsive buying and collecting, you should think twice about buying a DE razor. There are even websites devoted to men who cannot control themselves like me on the internet indulging shaving culture. I initially bought this to save money on expensive cartridge razors, now I have spent more money than I have ever imagined on shaving products. By far it ended up costing me much more than expensive fusion or quattro blades, but like I said, if you can control yourself, then give it a shot.</li>
    <li> Shaving with a safety razor such as this one has done wonders for my husbands razor burn problems. Trouble is that a razor used in the shower will be dropped, however infrequently, and the rim which connects the blade and top to the handle was small and flimsy and broke off. As a result the razor is unusable. The moral is to treat this razor gently. Perhaps a future design will be engineered a little stronger.</li>
    <li> The build quality on the razor is top-notch.  All of the parts fit together perfectly and confidently.  It hasn&#x27;t shown a hint of rusting anywhere (which is probably the biggest risk with something like this).  And it gives me a better shave than my previous Gillette Mach 3 ever did.  The main reason it gives a better shave is that the single razor blade has a smaller area of interface with my face, so I can control it more precisely.  Also, because it doesn&#x27;t have a hinge on it like the Mach 3, I can control the angle of the razor against my face, and get total shaving control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know this definitely costs a lot more than a Mach 3 handle, but I&#x27;d rather pay more for the razor once and get cheap blades for life than pay little for the razor once and get expensive blades for life.  I&#x27;ll have saved money on this purchase within a year.</li>
    <li> As I wrote in my review of the Feather razor blades, I am leaving this review to offer some hopefully balanced, personal perspective on my use of this razor. This is a great razor -- I enjoy using it each morning, actually look forward to it. It is well made and seems durable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s going to change my life. I feel the need to note this because it seems like many reviewers are experiencing some messianic compulsion to impart mythological powers to these shaving instruments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When used with a good blade, this is a great razor. I like that it&#x27;s heavy and has the longer handle - but note that this length which they describe as \\&quot;long\\&quot; is actually what you&#x27;d expect as a standard length, while the \\&quot;standard\\&quot; length handles seem rather short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mechanics of the razor are straightforward and seem to promise increased reliability compared to the hinged models, which look fun to operate but may wear out over time. This one just has a head that screws on and off -- simple to maintain and less to go wrong. Putting in a new blade is fast and easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I work in a fairly professional office with a bunch of bigwigs wandering the halls feeling important, so I need a clean, professional looking shave every morning. I get that with this razor. But it does not reduce my beard to sub-molecular thickness after a single pass, which I&#x27;ve seen claimed by some reviewers on here. In the interest of full disclosure I will say that I do not have as extensive a \\&quot;pre-shave\\&quot; routine as some. I don&#x27;t use a carefully strategized sequence of oils, creams, and other products to prepare my beard for the moment of actual shaving. What I do is soften up my beard with a hot shower and then some time with a steaming hot wash cloth. Then I shave. I don&#x27;t use all those other products because, while I truly enjoy the ritual and process of shaving, there&#x27;s a limit to how much time I want to spend on it: it&#x27;s a balance between how much time I want to spend on myself to make myself feel a little more manly and civilized, and the time available between the alarm and getting out the door for work. What I want in a razor is to enable me to spend the amount of time I&#x27;m prepared to spend, while still giving me a nice shaving experience. Does this razor do that? Yes it does, with some caveats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I perform a standard 3 pass shave (with the grain, across, and against) and, as I said, get a close, professional looking shave every morning. I find that I don&#x27;t get the skin-close level of the shave until on the 3rd pass, which I do against the grain. On days where I don&#x27;t have any meetings I can get away with quitting after the 2nd pass. I would not go into the office after just the first pass, as the beard is only reduced to around the five o&#x27;clock shadow level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this perspective has been useful in helping some of you make a decision. A razor is a very personal item that you will be using every morning. I am pleased with my purchase and really enjoy using this razor -- even if it isn&#x27;t magical.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to wet shaving and I&#x27;m glad I got into it. My skin feels so much better and I don&#x27;t have breakouts like I did before. The razor is very sturdy and doesn&#x27;t feel cheap like those \\&quot;Modern\\&quot; razors. I&#x27;m a big dude and I&#x27;d be more comfortable with a slightly longer handle, but it&#x27;s working great for me. I&#x27;m so glad that I bought this!</li>
    <li> My fiance has wanted a safety razor for a long time now. I got it for his birthday and he loves it! It comes with one razor in the box (just wish it came with 2 or 3). But the one razor has lasted him the whole month now! He got it July 11 and we&#x27;re in Aug and he&#x27;s still using the same razor it came with. Great value and excellent quality. Heavy and heavy duty. Satisfied customers!</li>
    <li> Awesome works like a charm thx so much appreciated it so much thanks again great shave for me and for all</li>
    <li> Got sick of paying $50+ for the 4-5-6-7-8+ blade razors and decided to go back to basics. This feels good in your hand, is easy to clean, and delivers a great shave with the right blade. It does take a bit of getting used to in order to avoid nicks and scrapes, but you really do only need one blade to get a great shave. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this razor.  Going with an &amp;#34;old fashioned&amp;#34; razor over the double and triple edge blades has saved me a ton of money.</li>
    <li> I came into the world of safety razors fairly recently, and this one does a great job of allowing the weight of the head and handle to smoothly carry the razor down through stubble without having to apply any pressure as you would with cartridge-variety blades. The handle won&#x27;t slip in the wettest hands, and the solid construction is reassuring as you&#x27;re dragging a razor past your jugular.</li>
    <li> Not the greatest but certainly not the worst. Great for a beginner.</li>
    <li> I shave my head, and this razor is not ideal for that task at all. on my face its ok, but it takes me a heck of a lot longer than it did with the Fusion I was using before mostly because of the ability for the Fusion to change its angle as you shave whereas this razor has to be held just right... it&#x27;s a good money savor if you have the time though.</li>
    <li> I started out with a Feather DE travel razor and was getting an ok shave. After researching Merkur and speaking with friends who shave with DEs, I decided to purchase this razor. This is the best thing I have ever shaved with. Simple in design (gotta love the Germans), sturdy, and well made of solid steel (chrome plated). Feels great in the hand and is heavy (great for DE shaving).     Comes in a nice Merker marked cardboard box with a sample Merkur blade. You can literally open the box and start shaving.     I would not be surprised if this razor out lives me by many, many years. Well done Merkur, well done.</li>
    <li> I like better than my antique gillette.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll keep this review short and sweet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes I cut myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy the Proraso soap and the tweezerman brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Throw away the razor it comes with and buy this (100ct): [[ASIN:B0022R947O Feather Hi-Stainless Platimum Double Edge Razor Blades 50 Ct]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See title and star rating and figure it out yourself if I like it. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving like this can get messy. Don&#x27;t wear a shirt and have a towel handy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only shaved with this piece once but my initial impressions are good. I started using a DE razor 2 years ago when I picked up a cheap 5 euro Wilkinson Sword classic plastic handle and some blades while living in Germany. Man what a difference between the two. The heft of this handle makes shaving almost effortless. I couldn&#x27;t believe the blade was taking hair away as it was so smooth. These handles are made in Solingen Germany which is known for producing high quality steel. I haven&#x27;t had any nicks, and I actually find this handle to be more forgiving than the cheap Wilkinson Sword. Please, do yourself a favor and learn the art of shaving with this handle. The major razor companies like Gillette are robbing the public blind by charging such an extraordinary amount for their cartridges. By using a DE razor you save a ton of money, you get a better shave, and you feel like a gentleman. Also do yourself a favor and get a nice soap and badger hair brush.</li>
    <li> I learned to shave with a safety razor back in the early 70s, after watching my dad use one all my life. Of course, like many men, I shifted to the cheaper (ha!) multi-blade devices and disposables. I also tried my hand at electric razors, but never found them satisfactory. Over the years, like with most other consumer products, modern razors seem to have deteriorated in quality and capability while increasing in price.    After reading an article on line about wet shaving, I decided to take the plunge again and chose this Merkur 180 safety razor handle (this is also known as the 23C). I also purchased a 44-blade sample pack to try different brands of blades.    After a week, I can state that this Merkur razor is an excellent choice, even for the novice wet shaver. At about $30, it&#x27;s reasonably priced. With it&#x27;s longer handle, getting the right angle on your beard is easier (and one of the critical parts of the proper wet shave). The razor has a great finish, is well-constructed, and as a three-piece device is simple to take apart and clean. With its generous heft, the Merkur gives the feel of a finely-crafted tool, substantial in the hand.    You will probably need to try a variety of blades and shave creams to find the one that fits your face, your beard and your skin. The Merkur 180 gomes with a single Merkur blade, which is found to be very sharp and a bit aggressive. Since then, I have tried a Gillette 7 O&#x27;Clock and Feather blades, and found the latter to be a great blade. (The Gillette was too mild on my beard, and simply didn&#x27;t remove my whiskers well at all). Your blade mileage may vary, so try different blades.    Combine the Merkur 180 with the right blade, a good badger hair shaving brush, a nice shaving soap and a stand to hang everything by the sink, and you&#x27;re on your way. I highly recommend this great razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling for the past 25-years with razor burn, in-grown hairs and bumps on my neck from shaving.  I&#x27;ve tried every Gillette razor and even bought a few electric shavers.  All left me disappointed.    From my first three shaves with the Merkur, my shave is entirely different. The bumps are gone and the ingrown hairs too!  I wish I had found this razor sooner.  If you&#x27;ve been struggling with your shave...do not hesistate...get DE razor.    I am still using an aerosol shaving cream, but have ordered a shaving brush and new shaving cream to compliment my new razor.</li>
    <li> Not as smooth as I thought</li>
    <li> I bought this razor for much the same reasons I hear others do - sick of spending lots of $$$ on disposables and also wanting to reconnect with how our grandfather&#x27;s shaved. So I took the plunge and decided to try this out. After some research I decided not to spend a ton of money because I thought this may not work out.    Well, I have used this razor now for a week, and I am absolutely blown away by it. I have had closer shaves than I have ever had in my life. Just today I skipped a shave because I simply didn&#x27;t need to, and I have a fairly heavy beard. I also use the tweezerman badger brush and Col. Conk&#x27;s rum soap. The only thing I am missing now is a good aftershave.    If you are considering trying out a double edge razor, I could not recommend it more and this Merkur model is awesome. Just take your time, shave gently and you will find the cleanest shave you have likely ever had.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read many reviews, tried to figure out what would be a good place to start, so I got the Merkur 180, i hadnt got a clue how to use one, i&#x27;d seen my dad use a safety razor as a kid, but by the time i needed to shave gillette had brought out the mach razor, so easy, close and frustration free, until you had to buy a blade that is...so after 20 years of shaving, i plunged into the safety razor world and all i can say is wow, i didnt know how to correctly shave as im sure there is a right and wrong way, but first time i shaved was a few minutes ago and i cant believe the results, closest ever shave, no More mach for me, this item is great.</li>
    <li> I am new to safety razors, and this was a good place to start. Easy to use, let the weight of the razor do the work. Quality product, works as described. I use gel foam with it just fine. Only downside to this style of razor vs. the multiblade disposable is the time required to get a good shave, although that isn&#x27;t a fault of the product. I do get a closer shave with this, but takes 2 to 3 shaves. Only thing I didnt like was the DE razor, dulled pretty quick. I got about a week out of it.</li>
    <li> Why did I wait so long to make the switch? Way back when...I watched my dad use a safety razor day in and day out as there were no disposables. I bought into the 2 blade, then the 3 blade mach, then 4 blades...all because they gave a &amp;#34;closer&amp;#34; shave. However with each blade came an additional $ or 2 for a replacement. $10 - $12 for 4 blades is beyond ridiculous. So I made the switch and I won&#x27;t go back. The razor looks and feels good. It looks very well made and durable. As compared to a disposable or re-fillable, the razor is heavier and takes a little getting used to. After 2 weeks, I love the extra weight and controllability of this razor. I shave a finely, detailed goatee, and this single blade razor allows me to shave a closer detail than any disposable on the market.</li>
    <li> My razor broke in the same exact spot as every one else, the middle prong that screws into the handle.  See picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cleaned it every single time after shaving and this still happened.  Its a defect.</li>
    <li> Heavy weight makes control easy, getting used to using this type of razor. Have to relearn how to shave. Blades are much cheaper than the precious as gold multi-bladed cartridges. Like the longer handle.</li>
    <li> This is a great DE safety razor. I love the longer handle, I haven&#x27;t used a shorter one, but the longer handle helps when I shave my head. Great construction and after some practice I get great shaves with it. There’s a reason the ratings are so high on this razor.</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised</li>
    <li> Try it until you&#x27;re used to it before making a judgment. I haven&#x27;t used a safety razor since the seventies so I had to learn all over. Use a &amp;#34;light touch&amp;#34;, feel your face as you shave and shave AGAINST the way the whiskers grow. I only have to shave every other day using this method.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to DE razors by my dad when I was young. I got sick of paying for stupid cartridges that left my face looking like I had shaved with a potato peeler, so I decided to borrow his old school Gillette.  What a shave!  I decided to give his back and buy my own and this one does the job with no burn, or irritation.</li>
    <li> I have come to very much appreciate this razor.  It is comfortable in the hand, and it gives an excellent, close and comfortable shave.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor after reading some other sites saying double edge safety razors would give you a much better shave.  I was a little worried though because some people had said it was a lot easier to cut yourself with this type than with a disposable.  My worries went away though after my first shave.  The Merkur glides over my face well and feels like I&#x27;d have to push hard to cut myself.  In the past, I noticed I&#x27;d get some irritation with disposables and cheap shaving creams, but have found my skin feels great after using this razor with Proraso shaving cream.  I totally recommend switching to this kind of razor.</li>
    <li> I switched to this razor from a Gillette fusion power proglide and I did not end up a happy customer. Hear me out though, not that is single razor is completely at fault, but I did find some disadvantages to using a double edge razor. First of all the concept of only working at a specific angle to avoid carving up your face while shaving is a brilliant one, it does however make it very difficult to shave directly under your nose. Actually, every time I shaved with this razor I ended up with two small triangle patches of hair where the razor could not reach due to its beveled shape. This problem does not occur with a flat generic razor, but hey nothings perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the quality of the shave itself, I found it pleasant, but hard to compare to a cut-throat type or shaving twice with a Fusion ProGlide head. The time it took to shave took about the same time as a conventional razor which is nice, and it left a nick free shave with minimal irritation. However there was one flaw that was significant for me to toss this safety razor in the junk draw. I noticed that the Merkur, and other comparable shaves did not get nearly as close as a ProGlide head which left me with 5-O-Clock shadow by lunchtime. I never had this problem with my old razor. I tried using both feather and shark blades as well, but after I trialed all three blades for a week each, I found that all were pretty much in the same boat and left and stubble coming back quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then I have switched back to the expensive Gillettes, but I am better off. I have even brought up this topic at work and I found a few people who agree with me. Safety razors do give a great all around shave, but they don&#x27;t seem to be able to compete with the closeness of a good multi-blade, and certainly don&#x27;t keep their sharp edge for quite as long. If you agree with some part of this, I urge you not to go 100% contemporary with your shaving and keep using a good badger hair brush and a good preshave oil and English shaving soap.ng soap.</li>
    <li> ---UPDATE---&lt;br /&gt;I need to revise my original review of this razor. OMG was I doing it wrong! I sincerely apologize to the fine folks over at Merkur. When I initially got the razor, I did give it a try for about a month and was unimpressed with the results. My shaves were not clean, and I continued to break out after each use. Therefore, I put the blame on the razor. However, the fault was actually in my technique and also in the products I used in my shaving regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a pretty serious breakout of ingrown hairs, I decided enough was enough and visited the experts at the Art of Shaving and Sephora to discuss shaving and general skincare. I completely expected to have a lot of expensive products rammed down my throat, but I ended up getting a lot of great advice. First, the Feather blade I was using was too sharp. For my skin type, a thicker (or smoother) blade would be a better choice. I purchased a Gilette Platinum blade instead. Second, the razor I had been using was too aggressive. After initially giving up on the Merkur, I had reverted to an open-comb safety razor I purchased at a local beauty store. I am now using the Merkur razor with the Gilette Platinum blade. Third, I needed to have a shaving regimen. I purchased the pre-shave oil, shaving cream, and after-shave balm from The Art of Shaving (all unscented), and it&#x27;s completely changed how I approach Shaving. And fourth, i really needed to get a skin care regimen in place that included a proper cleanser, toner, and moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been 2 weeks now and my skin looks incredible. My shaves have never been so comfortable or lasted this long. I know what I described above sounds like a lot for the average guy, but trust me, it&#x27;s worth it. That old saying, &amp;#34;An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.&amp;#34; is absolutely true!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m unimpressed by this razor. I bought it after reading so many positive reviews on Amazon. I switched to using safety razors about a year ago and was enjoying having less irritation and closer shaves. I purchased a safety razor for Sally Beauty Supply, which worked very well. The only reason I was considering making the change is because the &amp;#34;stainless steel paint&amp;#34; on the Sally Beauty Supply razor had started to peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this unit expecting the world. However, I&#x27;ve not been able to get a good shave with this product. I figured I&#x27;d give it a month to see if I just needed to work on my technique. Alas, no improvement. As soon as I restarted using the old safety razor, I was back in business. I think it&#x27;s inability to give me a close shave has to do with the bevel of the shave head. It&#x27;s just too deep. One would have to apply a significant amount of pressure to the skin to get a close enough shave. With my other razor, that&#x27;s not necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be in the market for anoth product.</li>
    <li> The quality of this razor is exceptional. The handle is long enough for my long fingers and its diameter is right for the razor to be handled comfortably. It was an upgrade from a cheap safety razor I&#x27;ve bought for testing wet shaving and this upgrade made a whole lot of difference. If you&#x27;re a beginner - look no further, this is THE razor. Now, some details:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The picture has colors way off, the real color is steel, no yellow tint at all. Machining quality is outstanding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- There comes one spare Merkur blade with this razor, so you could compare the bade with blades you might already have. Astra blades that I have are a bit wider than this blade, so I assume a razor&#x27;s aggressiveness depends on blades too. Also, Astra blades have a slightly bigger openings in the middle that allow shifting a blade a bit sideways, which will result into one side being more aggressive than the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Your shaving experience mostly depends on your technique, less so on the razor. I was shaving with cheap razors for a long time, and, while the results were satisfactory, all the fiddling (every new blade had to be adjusted individually, different sides of the razor required different angles, bad metal required rinsing and drying every time) becomes a daily burden. This razor takes most of it away so you could focus on shaving itself. Take your time, make this time a pleasure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Do not save on blades. I used to think a new blade is too sharp, so I was reusing blades up to 5 shavings, stropping it at about 3rd shaving. Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn&#x27;t. Every face is individual, find blades that fit you and your razor.</li>
    <li> This is like the razor I first used 55 years ago.  I like it a lot as I get good shaves with it, although I do with the modern multiblade ones as well, but now I save a lot of money.  I recommend that users let the razor do the work and do not force or bear down with it.  If you do, you will cut yourself.  The razor itself is much heavier than the new ones, so use use that weight to your advantage and do not press down much.  For you guys like me who take blood thinners, you will likely need to keep a little styptic close by.  I do, but I did with my plastic razor as well.</li>
    <li> great product. takes a bit of practice to be able to use efficiently. it is a twist off type so the razor blade sandwiches between the head and guard. the handle twists on. the only issue i have with this is that i can&#x27;t seem to get the razor lined up straight (i&#x27;m probably doing something wrong).</li>
    <li> This razor has a nice heft and balance to it. It looks to be well made. Time will tell how well.</li>
    <li> I shopped for a long time before deciding on the Merkur Model 180 razor.  Price was not the determining factor for me -- I wanted something solid, well-made, and that would last a very long time.  I paid about $60.  This razor has a good solid feel and the long handle suited me.  All was well until, after 18 months, the screw &#x27;welded&#x27; to the top plate broke.  The screw attaches the handle to the rest of the assembly.  There&#x27;s no way to repair.  This is very disappointing.  To fully disclose, I did drop it in the shower -- but it should have held up to a single 5-foot drop.  I tried to contact Merkur (Merkur Solingen, a division of DOVO) but they do not sell directly to consumers [...].  I will try to return this through Amazon to its sales partner.  This is no reflection on Amazon or its seller, but with Merkur.  Today I found a Schick one-piece stainless steel razor at a vintage shop; the razor is probably 30-40 years old, is at least as well-built as the Merkur, and I bought it for $5.  Very disappointed with Merkur&#x27;s build quality and reliability. [[ASIN:B000NL0T1G Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  After I posted this review, I searches deeper and found a contact email address for Merkur customer service.  I explained what happened and sent along three photos of the broken razor.  Within a few hours, I had a personal reply and an offer to ship a free replacement for the broken part.  They also sent a info sheet on how to maintain the razor.  I admit I never cleaned it beyond rinsing after each use.  According to them, calcium build-up from hard water causes the metal to corrode and weaken the connection point.  It&#x27;s not often I receive good customer service, but I was impressed that Merkur followed-up quickly and offered a replacement part.  Thanks, Merkur!</li>
    <li> Bought this with Double Edge Razor Blades (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0077LAJT2/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0)&lt;br /&gt;to shave my head it works extremely well.  I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I was on the edge after reading different blogs and reviews, mostly because the upfront cost is like buying a new electric razor. But since the switch I could no be happier. I bought this razor along with a good shaving soap and a brush. Razor burn and irritation, all gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The longer handle is nice at first for switching from the &#x27;traditional&#x27; cartridges that most people are used to, but I can see my self switching to the standard length handle that come on all other Merkur models.</li>
    <li> This is the coolest most balanced razor out there. Cuts smoothly w/o a care in the world. Razor bumps are getting to be a thing of the past thanks to this great product. Merkur is thee best!</li>
    <li> No more plastic disposable razors!  I have been using the long handled safety razor for about 6 months now and am still loving it!  I use it for my underarms, legs, and down there.  My only problem with these razors is that you have to shave a bit slower than with a plastic razor.  They are sharper, so you do get a closer shave.  I even bought one for my Dad for his birthday!  He loves it too!</li>
    <li> I find this is the peefect safety razor for me. So much I am buying a second one for travel. Tried a few others but this one has good weight and balance. Gets close and blade is held secure. Always get a good shave with this razor.</li>
    <li> I really like using this razor with per shave oil and a nice soap. Use the weight of the razor! Don&#x27;t press to hard. Let the razor to the shaving. I ordered Derby blades to get used to using a safety razor. Plan to graduate to the Japanese Feather blades when I get better at using this. GREAT FOR A BALD HEAD!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a younger guy that was looking for a closer shave. Not quite willing to put up with the maintenance of a straight blade I decided to try a D/E razor first. First off the fit and finish of this razor is simply amazing. With some feather blades I was able to get very close shaves after only a few days of trying. I have since moved to a second hand adjustable razor but this one will stay with me for a long time to come.</li>
    <li> Let me just say I had tried every gimmick, cream, and every marketable disposable blade razor, none worked....till now!  So I&#x27;m new to DE shaving, it really does work like all the reviews on here say, and I settled on the Merkur because of the reviews, and price.      Onto the razor:      Like the 4\\&quot; long handle, if anything I would prefer it a little longer.    Simple, robust, effective 3 piece design.    Blade seats straight and true.      Cleans very easy, doesn&#x27;t clog like a multiblade during shaving.    Its kind of plain looking but the finish is nice.    Since this was my first DE razor I didn&#x27;t want to drop a ton of money until I figured out if I liked it.  Now that I know it works, I may step up to one of these razors someday.  [...]    Pointers:    1.  Use shaving soap, brush and mug.  2.  You don&#x27;t have to press as hard as with a multiblade.  3.  Keep a good lather.  4.  Don&#x27;t be scared.</li>
    <li> It took some getting used to, but I now love using this over disposable ones.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  Long term, much cheaper than disposables.&lt;br /&gt;  Gives a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;Con:  Needed to get used to it, but that is not the product&#x27;s fault.  That is due to inexperience using the safety razor.</li>
    <li> I really, really, really got sick and tired of buying disposable razors. I used to buy the normal venus three pack, they recently came up with an upgraded version (which, of course, is more expensive) and made the lotion strip smaller on the one I bought. I was pissed that I had to pay $7.99 for three razors, making it $10.99 for two is just over the top. I had mentioned this on facebook and some of my guy friends suggested a safety razor. It had not even occurred to me. I looked for the best reviewed one here that was reasonably priced and came across this one. I got it today and immediately jumped in the shower to shave my legs. IT IS AMAZING! this is the smoothest shave I have ever had. My legs and armpits feel downright heavenly. I did nick myself on my ankle but that is because I had my foot flexed, that would have happened with a disposable. I highly recommend this to any woman who is thinking about saving money, even with the initial investment I calculated that I will save about $125 this year. ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS. I can buy myself a bettie page dress for that!</li>
    <li> I finally had enough with paying $20 a month for razor blades. I have tried everything from single and double blade disposables, to the latest from Gilette and Schick. This product has by far exceeded my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally, If I let my beard grow for more than a day, I have to use and electric shaver to trim down my facial hair to get one of the above mentioned razors too work. This isn&#x27;t because of length but mainly because of how thick my facial hair is. Not so with this razor, It cut through a 3 day beard no problem! It is comfortable to hold, easy to clean, and easy to operate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few things to note if you are coming from store bought razors: You cannot just push this product into your face and expect it to give you a close shave with no cuts, you have to find the angle that the hair grows out of your face to get the closest shave with the best comfort. Also, dry shaving with this is nearly impossible if that is how you shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this product 5 stars because of its build quality, ease of use, comfortable use, and effectiveness.</li>
    <li> Excellent! As advertised!</li>
    <li> I did my research/homework, looked through masses of reviews on many makes and finally after a lot of time decided on the Merkur 180 which is also the Merkur 23C. I am glad a decided on this model for the longer handle, more control over it. It comes in a basic box with a free blade to try, its easy to take apart and then to assemble, they have made a hole all the way through the handle to allow water to run so it doesn&#x27;t sit in the blade head and cause any damage (good idea I thought). The use is very easy and natural just take it slow and keep that head tilted (of the razor I man). I didn&#x27;t find the merkur blade that was included a great shave it was smooth but once you got under the jaw and onto the neck where you tend to be more careful the cut wasn&#x27;t so great. I blame the blade and not the razor and will try some different blades as I do have sensitive and not so smooth skin there so want a good clean cut around those areas. I used to old style shave years back and enjoyed and I have to say i enjoyed this, you just cannot get that from an electric or really a plastic disposable thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this razor its built well, works well and looks nice but I do suggest getting a stand so you don&#x27;t keep laying it down as things may get caught under the blade, to damage the blade. I got the shaving kit they sell in Target that has a shaving mug with soap, brush and plastic stand for both the brush and razor. Worth $20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Th seller on my purchase was Shave USA and fulfilled by Amazon, no problem but did take about a week before they shipped it, but I have noticed that seems to be the case in a lot of orders these days.</li>
    <li> I do not like the double edge safety razor, even the cheap throw aways give you a bbs shave. Better to buy a different item.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something more eco-friendly in the way of razors and shaving.  This product fits that bill.  I love that it&#x27;s double sided.  I haven&#x27;t once cut myself using this since I got it a few months ago.  I definitely like the long handle and the weight of it.  I unscrew it a bit and let it air dry outside of the shower in between uses.    Edit: (10.6.16) I&#x27;ve had this razor for over a year now.  I&#x27;ve definitely cut myself a few times with this razor, mostly on my knees and ankles.  The angle I use it has a big effect on how well it works.  It takes a bit to figure out the optimal angle.  The part between the handle and the unscrewing mechanism has loosened a little bit so that I have to hold it in place to unscrew it to change the blade.  I&#x27;ve found that the blades last a long time, which is great.  I got the variety pack, and there has only been one blade I wasn&#x27;t that happy with out of the 6-7 in the 15 pack I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
    <li> I really like mine. It seems to be well constructed and I don&#x27;t think it will break for a long time (or ever). Feels nice in my hand and has a bit of weight to it so you can gracefully slide the blade across your face. This razor gives the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had and feels kinda nice too. Try holding it upside down and shaving like that (especially around your chin/neck area). I found I got an even closer shave by shaving with razor upside down on my chin. I also feel classy as hell using it vs my old electric razor so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
    <li> My whole life I spent using the multiple blade razors because they were supposed to be a new and improved design. Finally I&#x27;d had enough. Between the expensive heads wearing out quickly, or plugging up constantly with stubble, I needed to find a better way. When I went looking on Amazon for a better razor the reviews led me to purchase the Merkur 180. I could not be happier with this razor! Not only does it not plug up like the multiple blade razors, but it seems to do a better job. The cost of blades is quite a relief as well. All in all I highly recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> My 72 years old father uses this classic ones, but this was far better for him...Why? for safety reasons. his pulse is not good and this razor provides him a good shave without mistakes and accidents.</li>
    <li> My disclaimer for this review is that I have no other safety razor experience to compare this one to.  I&#x27;ve been shaving with various Gillette and Shick, multi-blade cartridges for most of my adult life.  Shaving was always a dreaded experience that left me broken out and with irritated skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After adopting a more sophisticated prep and post-shave, I was still having trouble with razor burn and irritation.  A friend recommended I research safety razors, as he had heard they are much easier on the skin once the technique is mastered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor comes highly recommended, and most of the shaving philosophy sites say this, or it&#x27;s short-handled brother, are awesome starter razors.  Before buying this, I shaved at most every other day with mixed results.  Since it has arrived, I have shaved daily with little to no irritation, and I&#x27;ve never gotten such a close, complete shave.  You really need to make a ritual out of your morning shave for the system to work, but I now look forward to my 6-10 minute morning shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice: if your skin has reacted poorly to the multi-blade systems, this might be a good solution.  I would break out and see redness and ingrown hairs frequently with my old cartridges.  Instead of five blades scraping your skin with every pass, try one good blade per pass with a safety razor.  Get a good pre-shave treatment, buy a good brush and some soap or cream, and find an aftershave that works for you.  Shaving doesn&#x27;t have to ruin your face and your day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also consider the economics.  The razor is about $30 and I&#x27;m told will last a lifetime if cared for, the blades are $0.50 at most (can be way cheaper, it just depends on what you buy), and you&#x27;re already buying creams, oils and aftershaves.  You&#x27;ll be less inclined to try and squeeze every last use out of a $0.50 blade than you will a $5.00 cartridge, so you&#x27;ll always have a sharp, fresh blade working for you.</li>
    <li> I ordered this particular razor due to the positive reviews and price.  I have not been disapointed.  I got it quick and it works great.  I am hoping to save $ on the new over priced multi-edged razor blades.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used a safety razor in over 30 years and this one is nice.  I like the weight of it.  The top unscrews and then you put the blade in.  It is not one of those where you twist the handle and the top opens up.  This razor gave me a close shave. You just use the weight of it to shave, not pressing on your skin.</li>
    <li> A few days ago I had, quite by accident, dropped my old safety razor (S.R.) and the head snapped off. It was a Parker. I am aware that these are not the best, but I didn&#x27;t want to have much money invested in an S.R. if I was not sure if I would like it or not. It also came with 100 7 a.m. blades, so how could I lose? 3 years later, I still love using an S.R. and will not willingly go back to using a cartridge razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I was writing, the head popped off of my old S.R. and I needed to buy a new one. I searched all over to find a brick-and-mortar building that I could purchase one from, but to no avail. Saying that, I was forced to buy some cartridges to use and decided to order a new S.R. off of Amazon.com. The package arrived very quickly, in not even 2 days, and came to my doorstep in good condition. It came with a free trial razor-blade by Merkur, as well, which I have not used yet because I still have a lot of 7 a.m. blades to use, but from previous experience they are very good blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On to the product itself. It has great balance, and the long handle allows for better maneuverability. This also allows for a better shave. The balance of the weight puts more at the head so that it smoothly glides across the face due the weight of the head pushing down upon it. I can honestly say that there is a complete difference between the two S.R.s I have used and am very happy with this purchase. Don&#x27;t take this the wrong way, though, I still enjoyed my Parker and it was a great training razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor is heavy, which I like, and seems to be very durable and should last a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this purchase.</li>
    <li> Awesome razor!  I get a nice clean and close shave every time with no nicks at all.  I also use on the back of my neck as well. The thin handle doesn&#x27;t cramp my hand like some other razors I own. It&#x27;s now my go to razor.</li>
    <li> The Gillette cheapo with replacable 2 blade pieces shaves better.&lt;br /&gt;However, compared to other older-style razors, this one is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;I re-wrote this review, because the prior one was too critical.</li>
    <li> The Merkur is my second safety razor. I just recently switched from a cartridge razor to a safety razor. The first one I bought, the handle was smooth and short and I cut my face up pretty good. I figure part of that was learning to shave with a safety razor, but the other issue was that the short smooth handle would get slippery after it got wet and that made it hard to shave. I saw the long handled Merkur and decided to try it. I really like this razor, I have not had any issues with cuts and I am getting a very good shave. The long handle with the grip makes it easy to hold steady when it is wet. If you are looking to switch to a safety razor, I would absolutely recommend the Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase.  I hadn&#x27;t shaved with a safety razor for 30 years.  Make sure a do some research before you start.  It is not the same technique as shaving with a disposable.  The razor itself has nice weight and I really like the longer handle.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my boyfriend. He thought it made shaving easier and fun again. I think the noticeably closer shave is awesome.</li>
    <li> Great product so far. Sturdy construction. The longer handle makes it easier to handle. You do need to use good blades so don&#x27;t cheap out on the bargain brands. You&#x27;re face will appreciate it in the end.</li>
    <li> regardless if your or novice or advance, you should invest in this razor. it has a nice solid, heavy build to it and works marvelously. I can say that cause im new to this shaving thing. it really is a safe razor to shave with because i haven&#x27;t cut myself (yet) except for that one time when i was fooling around (golden).. it holds the blade tightly. the sample blade that comes with it is...ok, least in my opinion. its still very sharp, so be careful. the handle isnt that \\&quot;long\\&quot;, but long enough for my hands to hold comfortably. overall, id give it a 5 star. excellent. buy it, you won&#x27;t regret it. ;)</li>
    <li> So. I read the reviews until I had a headache then I came back and read them for two more days to decide which razor I should get.  After receiving this long handled razor (not so long though compared to the multiple razor family) I shaved with my \\&quot;Art of Shaving Oil, cream and aftershave, full Kit\\&quot; and I got bumps and nicked and some cuts using the razor that it came with.   I immediately switched to the shark super chrome razors 100 pack that I ordered for my second shave and still, I was not happy.  But by the third time, I started to see and feel what people where talking about. \\&quot;the theraputic shave\\&quot; Suddenly, I began to take pride in my shave. I started to look forward to shaving and still do. I got the technique down to apply the right pressure, move my skin by my adams apple and perfected my stroke.  Is this as close as a shave as the gillete fusion or mach 3 million? Not quite but with proper technique you can get a very very close shave. I&#x27;ll tell you what. I have not used my multiple razors brands since I received this safety razor.     My Advice. Buy this razor and get a small pack of razor blades and if your not happy after four or five shaves, return it. I think that you will find the same sense of pride and enjoyment of shaving with this system that I currently have now.  Since my purchase, I decided to get the staneless steel mixing bowl and razor and brush stand. I also bought the poraso shaving cream in the tube but I think the Jack Black Triple Cushion Shaving cream and art of shaving cream are both better.  The set looks beautiful and cant wait to shave again.  Enjoy!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for about a week and am totally in love with it. I&#x27;ve previously bought quite a few electric razors and cartridge systems but have eventually grown dissatisfied with them. My beard grows in pretty thick and I never really felt like anything else I tried really gave me a great shave. Decent and presentable, but not great.  There is a definite learning curve with wet-shaving but the results are worth it.  It does take some additional time in the morning to soak the brush, lather up some shaving soap and make a few passes with this razor but the result is the best shave that I&#x27;ve ever had. This elevates shaving from a daily chore into daily ritual that I look forward to.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the merkur model 180. I get a good close shave and with my [[ASIN:B000RI8BZQ Proraso Shaving Cream 5.2 oz (147 g)]] and [[ASIN:B000HDN8JU Barc Bump Down, Razor Bump Relief 3.4 fl oz (100 ml)]], and I get no razor burn (where as I have always gotten razor burn with multi-blades and even electrics). My only complaint with the razor is that it could have more weight. I sometimes need 2 passes to get super smooth skin though this may be due to the thickness of my facial hair. Overall I&#x27;m very satisfied but I&#x27;d look at something a bit heavier if you get the chance, maybe the [[ASIN:B000JPKLUU Merkur \\&quot;Futur\\&quot; Safety Razor, Satin Finish]] which also has an adjustable blade angle.    Anyways, don&#x27;t forget to get yourself a nice boar hair brush and keep it a bit wet to get the best amount of foaminess in your shaving cream. Technique makes all the difference in shaving.</li>
    <li> I recommend this to all my friends using the new style razors.  Traditional is the way to go.  Expensive up front, but will save you money in the long run.</li>
    <li> I have used every gimick razor out there, from Mach 3&#x27;s to the new 5 blade jobbers. None of them have given me a closer shave without irritation than the Merkur model 180. Even with the 5 blade fusion or hydro I still got razor bumps. I use an old fashion bristle brush and shaving soap to lather. The old is new again! Best decision I made was trying this set up. Highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:  I also bought a pack of the Merkur platinum single blades. The razor comes with one. They are excellent!</li>
    <li> I recently got tired of wrestling disposable razors and running out at inopportune times. In the process of researching straight edge razors for the fun of it, I ran across safety razors again. I mean, I learned to shave with safety razors, then injectable blades, then on to disposable twin blade cartridges and finally whole disposables. I decided to try a safety razor again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This produces a great, smooth shave and is very comfortable to use. A quick rinse under the faucet immediately clears shaving debris, unlike a lot of the twin blade disposables I&#x27;ve used. The cost of old-fashioned razor blades is nothing compared to the disposables and cartridges. It doesn&#x27;t put plastic in the landfill and I don&#x27;t feel like I have to get extra mileage out of each blade now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a couple of safety razors now, but for daily use I prefer the Merkur Model 180&#x27;s longer handle. It&#x27;s just easier to control and get those odd angles when needed. Treat yourself...sometimes new isn&#x27;t always better.</li>
    <li> A great beginner razor and it&#x27;s so great I have bought many others but unconsciously reach for this one every morning</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome! I remember seeing them in my grandpas bathroom, so I decided to make the switch based on that and all the hype.&lt;br /&gt;Well its true, if your on the fence switch, and have no fear with this razor, I&#x27;m getting pretty good at it and it hasn&#x27;t been long. The razor itself is high quality, its got a good weight and feel to it, the grip works well to even when soapy.</li>
    <li> I started shaving when I was 14 years old and used a Gillette double edge razor. It was great. For some dumb reason, I switched to disposables. At 64 I bought an inexpensive double edge at CVS to make sure I wanted to go back. So after about six months I purchased the Merkur Long Handle. I love it. Some people say the short handle is easier to control. I disagree. This razor is easy to use and control. Remember, let the razor shave, don&#x27;t press hard. The blades are easy to load and the razor is heavy duty and well made. Try a cheap double edge to make sure you like it, but get one of these for long term use.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Price! This is by far the best feature of this item. Blades are really really cheap and you can shave for pennies.&lt;br /&gt;Weight: this razor has a nice feel&lt;br /&gt;Less plastic thrown away&lt;br /&gt;Safe: I have experienced very few nicks&lt;br /&gt;2 sided blade means less rinsing&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;This shave will not match the Mach 5 ever! Others may disagree but it is reality.&lt;br /&gt;Slower: you have to move slower and with greater care with this type of razor&lt;br /&gt;Changing blades takes longer until you get the hang of it.</li>
    <li> This Safety razor comes with 1 sample Merkur Blade in box. Razor works great! I was very afraid to use for the first time. Did not cut myself like I thought I would, Do recommend buying Steptic Pencil for cuts. Noticed less neck irritation with Safety Razor vs Fusion Razor. Hope to save alot of money on Safety razors vs. Gillete Fusion razors (@ $15.00 for 4 cartridges)</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple of weeks now and I get nicked so often that I&#x27;m scared to use it and I keep band aids on the counter. I have been using a cartridge for years when&lt;br /&gt; I saw this on the internet and with so many good reviews, I thought I would give it a try. I also bought a box of Shark razors. Well maybe I didnt use it long enough or I&#x27;m not using it right but It&#x27;s not what I expected. It&#x27;s heavier so your hand gets tired, the head doesnt flex like a cartridge so you have to find the right angles, and you have to make many passes for closeness (not to mention all the cuts.) I don&#x27;t mean to bash the product, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a quality razor being from germany and it does look nice on the bathroom counter but from my experience, I think the cartridge (I use a Fusion) is easier to use, faster, shaves you closer with less passes, and you rarely get cuts. On the downside, it&#x27;s pricier and you feel more tugging on your face (probably due to the multiple blades) but to me, it&#x27;s more important to have a close shave without having to worry about getting nicked.</li>
    <li> came in quick and works great! Like the longer handle.</li>
    <li> First safety razor I have ever bought but I have no complaints what so ever.</li>
    <li> Awesome live it I bought  4 different ones for gifts this is mine and love it. Close shave and inexpensive 10 blade will last I&#x27;m on third week w same blade</li>
    <li> I have used the Gillette Sensor Excel since the middle 1990s, but have found it harder to justify the price of the name-brand older double blades and almost impossible to find generic double blades. I have a thicker than average beard and usually use both an electric and a double bladed shaver daily. I see no reason to use disposable plastic razors, my beard tends to clog triple / quadruple blades, and I refuse to pay $2 - $2.50 per blade. Had the market not changed, I would still be happy with my 15 year old Sensor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to the local mall looking for a Merkur razor but the Art of Shaving store was sold out of all models for the holiday season for over one month. I ordered one from Amazon and received it in about 4 days. This is the first safety razor I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes:&lt;br /&gt;1. My days of a quick shave are over. This is not a time-saver. I could probably get the same great shave using my Sensor razor if I took the same time and preparation - and could find cheap blades.&lt;br /&gt;2. The transition to the Merkur Safety razor was easier than I expected. I had visions of hacking my face up the first few times using it, but I have had no real nicks.&lt;br /&gt;3. The angle of the blade is key, as is the LACK of pressure used to shave. The razor feels heavy in my hand and seemingly glides in short strokes. The head does not pivot and it would be difficult to cut long paths. I bought the long-handled 180, but doubt the other models are much different. I have no basis to compare this to other safety razors.&lt;br /&gt;4. I shave twice - once with the grain, then against the grain. The shave is very, very close when I am finished - no need to use the electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, I think the mainstream razor companies have missed a great opportunity to produce a simple, uncomplicated, affordable product. As it stands, the Merkur looks like the same razor my father and grandfather used. I would recommend this razor to anyone who wants and affordable, dependable shave. Sorry, Gillette, you lost a customer for life.</li>
    <li> I love shaving with this razor!  It&#x27;s a closer shave, my skin doesn&#x27;t get irritated, and I feel ultra-manly every time I shave.  It is different shaving with this razor, so be sure you find a nice guide online.  One piece of advice:  I found canned shaving cream got in the way more than anything else with this razor.  Do yourself a favor and get a brush and some shaving soap, too.  Sooo much better.</li>
    <li> Smart shaving machine with necessary accuracy and good price!</li>
    <li> I, like many others, are having &amp;#34;sticker shock&amp;#34; over the price of cartridge razors.  I decide to go back to what my Dad and Grandfather did years ago, use a double-edge razor.  This razor is a work of art.  It&#x27;s heavy, yet well balanced.  I was a bit apprehensive when I made the first pull, but was amazed by how easy it shaved (Using the included blade.  I ordered some BIC blades which are supposed to be sharper). The finish on the razor is superb.  The shave was the best I&#x27;ve had in years.  Looking forward to many years of service.</li>
    <li> This is a really good razor for the value and performance, but tonight when I went to shave, the screw terminal at the top of the razor broke free.  The razor is useless at this point, so I&#x27;ll have to figure out how to get it returned for warranty.  Or just buy a new razor and be done with it.  Three years being used almost daily and feather blades works out to a couple of bucks a month to shave.  That&#x27;s a really good value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars because it doesn&#x27;t shave as well on a single pass as a multi-blade razor, but it gives a closer shave with a good shaving cream and several passes.  Not sure how that works...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, good razor, good value, might only last a few years.</li>
    <li> Excellent starter safety razor. Easy to use and clean.</li>
    <li> I used expensive, inconvenient disposables for years. This simple device along with a stand, a cup, a brush, blades, and real shaving cream works just as well as disposables and canned cream and is not only cheaper but is also way more convenient (a years supply of blades and cream takes up very little space).      All you do is put the blade in the razor, put a little water in the cup, dip your brush into the cream jar (just a quarter-sized dab is plenty), mix it around in the cup, brush it onto your face, and shave. Rinse the brush and cup, hang the razor and the brush on the stand and you&#x27;ve defeated the evil gillette/schick monolith.     Here&#x27;s what I bought:    Stand ($22, well worth it, the payback time on giving up disposables is pretty quick anyway). The stand is solid and looks good and very useful. Holds razor and brush.  [[ASIN:B001XURHNY Colonel Conk Evernice Model 775 Chrome Safety Razor Stand]]    Shaving cream (it&#x27;s a bowl of cream, not a bowl). I bought it 3 months ago and I&#x27;m not a quarter way through it so it will last more than a year for me (I have a 50% coverage beard). Also, it doesn&#x27;t have toxic substances in it the way commercial creams do. The sandalwood smell is strong if you don&#x27;t wash your face after shaving.   [[ASIN:B0007MW2ZW Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream Bowl, 6-Ounce]]    Shaving brush (no more spreading the canned cream with your hands). Always hang the brush after use.  [[ASIN:B000G647Y8 Tweezerman Men&#x27;s Shaving Brush]]    Blade sampler (the reviews convinced me that you have to decide for yourself which is the best blade). So far feather is best, shark cuts me up, the merkur that came with the razor is pretty good.   [[ASIN:B002Z85VJK 40 FEATHER BlueBird KAI GILLETTE ASTRA SHARK LORD DERBY Sampler Blades]]    I can&#x27;t believe how long it took me to figure out how to shave (more than 20 years . . . ).</li>
    <li> This is my first (and maybe only) safety razor. Other than the initial fear of cutting myself while installing the blade for the first time, everything has gone very smoothly (including my face). I definitely like the longer handle on this razor. My father in law has a shorter handled one, and I don&#x27;t think I would like it as much.    Only one nick, so far, and that was because of a careless moment on my part.    I highly recommend that you also purchase one of the blade samplers if this is your first safety razor. It will give you a broad selection of blades to try. My personal favorite so far are the Feather [[ASIN:B001G5HZCY Feather Hi-Stainless Platinum Double Edge Razor Blades 30 Ct]]. I guess the yellow and silver/black boxes are merely packaging differences.</li>
    <li> Every man that appreciates a shave should own this. It has a nice slight weight to it and feels nice in the hand. I will treasure this for as long as I can, and shaving with this paired with Merkur blades is basically shaving heaven. You can shave in every directions and have no razor burn after. For people new to saftey razor shaving, don&#x27;t be scared. As long as you lather up, you are good to go.</li>
    <li> fantastic old school safety razor, perfect for when you do not have the time to enjoy a straight razor shave.</li>
    <li> I recently made the change to safety razor shaving, and added this razor to my kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little disappointed at the packaging; you get the razor and a sample blade in an unsealed box with no paperwork. Yes, unscrewing the blade holder is simple, and keeping the razor clean and dry when not in use is common sense, but for $30+ I expected at least an insert with care guidelines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For being \\&quot;long handled,\\&quot; it&#x27;s about as long as my dad&#x27;s old Schick razor (~4 inches). That&#x27;s not a big deal though; it&#x27;s more about the feel and quality of the razor, which has a nice weight to it and glides over the more difficult areas (mustache, chin, and Adam&#x27;s apple) without causing irritation or cutting the skin. I like how you don&#x27;t have to put any pressure on the razor to slice the hair off; as long as you hold it right, the angle of the blade does the work for you. There&#x27;s also no clumping as long as you swish/rinse it after every few strokes, even if you&#x27;re removing a week&#x27;s worth of beard growth. Overall, it handles and performs much better than the old razor, or the Mach 3 (which just seems awkward after using this one).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, while I think it could be a little cheaper, it does deliver a great shaving experience and was worth the investment.</li>
    <li> Look, I&#x27;m mostly sorry I didn&#x27;t save Grandad&#x27;s vintage Gillette, but that&#x27;s neither here nor there. The Merkur does the job nicely, especially with my other purchase: [[ASIN:B001G5FOLI Feather Hi-stainless Double Edge Razor Blades]]. The construction looks good and has remained solid after a year. I would note that I the short-handled model may very well work fine regardless of hand size; I&#x27;m not sure the longer handle adds anything.</li>
    <li> I like the long handle very much. With the blades and this handle. I save a lot of money every month on disposable blades that coast more a month than what I paid for the blades and handle together. I figure I have enough blades to last at least two years if not more. The blades are double sided and the handle is a good fit.  If you want a good shave and save money and have a good comfortable shave this is the product I will most definitely recommend. .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how it all started, but I got on this kick questioning marketing ploys and schemes for all the products I use.  One day, my razor was in question.  I did a lot of research and decided to give a double edge razor a try.  After all, who can argue with the cost savings?  For me, my razors where getting really expensive.  I&#x27;m a triathlete.  And, I do shave most all body hair.  Especially the legs!  What an expensive habit!  And, the shave was never really that close.  It didn&#x27;t last all that long, either.    I bought the 1904 razor first.  What an aggressive shave!  But, boy was it close!  I&#x27;ve never felt such a smooth shave.  There was a little bit of a learning curve.  I cut myself a few times.  But, no big deal.  I got the hang of it quickly.    I needed another razor for my locker at work.  I then decided to give a longer handle a try (the shorter one can be a bit slippery for me) so I bought the Model 180.  What an awesome razor!  It shaves so beautifully!  (Must be the closer tolerances.)  It&#x27;s not as aggressive and I get cut less.  No razor burn, no partial shave, and a good soap makes the feel so nice.  I loved it so much, I bought another one for home.    I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve been so duped my whole life into disposable razors having something like two, three, four, or five blades, rotating heads, gel layer this and that, or whatever (isn&#x27;t there one with a battery now that vibrates?).  There can&#x27;t be any data all those blades shave better because one use of my double edge and I know instantly it puts every disposable razor to shame.    For me, this experience was well worth the try.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve recently begun to go back to the things my father and grandfathers used - tired of how all of our modern wonders are all, for the most part, shoddy pieces of overpriced plastic crap that don&#x27;t work nearly as well as what they replaced. I am really happy with this purchase and the decision to go back to a safety razor.    I have been shaving with a Braun electric for the last couple of years, having given up wet-shaving because of the rising costs and decreasing quality of the 20-bladed 1.21 gigawatt disposable monstrosities that have all but replaced safety razors. The Braun is a great electric razor but I simply miss wet shaving and the close, lasting shave that I used to get (I used to skip a day between shaves when I used a razor - the Braun is every day or deal with the scruff).    So I&#x27;m in a Wal-Mart looking for hair tonic (lose the J. Crew and Bed Head, guys - Vitalis is the stuff!) and right next to it I notice a 10-pack of double-edged safety blades for all of about $1.75. The gates of Heaven opened above my head and angels with clean, close shaves were blowing trumpets! I remembered being a kid and fooling around with my grandfathers&#x27; safety razor and marvelling at these heavy metal shaving tools. I remembered watching them shave, and the way they would smell afterwards. It was the small of manhood and all of the men in my family had &#x27;that smell.&#x27; How did I even forget that this was how men used to shave and that we still have athe option? It was the most amazing trip I ever had to a Wal-Mart. I look around to see if they sold the actual safety razor handles. Nada. OK - back to par-for-the-course with Wal-Mart.     I came back home, did a bit of research, and decide that I will purchase the Merkur 180. I purchased it along with a sample pack of blades, some Poraso shaving soap, and a Tweezerman Badger-hair brush. I picked up a Pinaud styptic pencil locally, just in case, and I already have some Pinaud Clubman aftershave lotion (ladies love the Clubman!). I was hesitant about the cost of the razor but it was pointed out this this is a tooled metal machine that will last a lifetime, not a scrap of plastic designed to fail deliberately.    When I took it out of the box, I noticed that the handle is not as long as I thought it would be - but it&#x27;s a good length. It looks exactly like it does in the picture so it&#x27;s just something mental. I mention this because I was tempted to save a couple of buck and get the short-handled version. I am glad that I didn&#x27;t. Not that this handle is short - the scale of the razor and the angle of the razor in the image just make it appear longer to me.    I loaded the Merkur with the single sample Merkur blade that came in the box with the handle. The head is solidly screwed to the handle and it came off cleanly with no wobble. The blade fit perfectly on the plate and the posts of the head fit perfectly through the holes in the blade. This means the blade was dead-centered in the head and perfectly parallel (meaning 2 perfect and identical shaving faces).     I have just had my first wet-shave in ages. WOW - how I&#x27;ve missed this. The hot water, the characteristic &#x27;sccchhhcrape&#x27; sound of the razor through the whiskers, the fresh smell of the soap. This handle is simply perfect. The balance is perfect for my hand and grip, the weight has just enough heft to it without being heavy - just enough to let the razor do the job without any effort from me. And finally - the head seems to just get to the right angle on its own. I found that once I got started I never had to stop and think about how I was holding it. It simply worked.    Before shaving I double-checked on how to use a safety razor:    Hydrate the beard with a hot, wet towel scrub  Warm the razor and wet the brush  Lather! lather! lather! Circular motion - get soap on all sides of the hair  Razor @ approx 30-35 degrees to the face  Let the weight of the handle do the work - Don&#x27;t push!  Shave 1 pass with the direction of the beardAlternate both edges of the blade and rinse frequently  Keep the skin wet  Lather again!  Shave another pass slightly diagonal to the beard  Feel around yer ugly gob and touch up where needed  Rinse face and tools, handle nicks  Dry tools  Splash on the aftershave    Truth told - I had a minor nick here and there but a quick dab with the styptic pencil and you don&#x27;t even see where they were. No worse than the nicks I used to get with the Gillette-Mach-Whatever. It&#x27;s a much better shave than the Braun electric, I am amazed at how well I did on my first pass, the shave is remarkably close and will only get better with practice, and I feel like a badass.</li>
    <li> At first I didn&#x27;t care for this razor, but that was my fault due to poor technique. I tried treating it like a modern cartridge razor and just seccedded in butchering up my face.  I went to the forum at The Shave Den, and they reminded me, like the vintage Gillettes I have and all the rest of the DE razors out there you CAN NOT PUT PRESSURE on it.  You must allow the weight of the razor to do the work.  It is whisker reduction, not whisker removal.  With a double edge you must take several passes and lather each time inbetween to get that baby butt smooth shave.    Using this razor is not something you&#x27;d want to do if you&#x27;re in a rush.  This is a razor you&#x27;d use to pamper yourself with.  Since I have switched to DE shaving, I find I have a smoother shave, a better complexion, and have not had razor burn at all which used to be the main reason I didn&#x27;t enjoy shaving.    The 180 is a well made razor, you can see and feel the quality of it.  The longer handle gives more room to grasp and control.  Over all it is one of the better DE razors I have used.  I have found it highly recommended by both new and experienced shavers.    If you are looking for more information on wet shaving or razors, I highly recommend  theshaveden.com   Tell them Brian sent you.  You will find there some of the nicest, well informed people who all willing to share their knowledge and love of their hobby, wet shaving.</li>
    <li> Quality construction, works as advertised. As long as it hold the blade will a good shave is really about the prep and a good quality blade.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this item before.  Due to carelessness on my part, it broke.  I subsequently ordered a replacement and had to suffer through the interim with an off-the-shelf, contemporary, conventional razor.  I hated it!  The shave was uncomfortable and I got terrible razor burn!  Now that I have my replacement, I&#x27;m going to be much more careful.  I love this razor.  I&#x27;m deployed in the Middle East and use a public latrine.  I get a LOT of sideways glances while I&#x27;m shaving with my badger hair brush and Merkur razor, but I wouldn&#x27;t trade it for the world.  The quality of the shave is top-notch and the resulting feel is luxurious.  If you&#x27;re considering this, go for it!  There&#x27;s certainly a learning curve, and if your priority is speed, you might want to reconsider, but it&#x27;s worth the time and effort!</li>
    <li> EDIT:  I wrote the following before I realized this 3 piece razor was not idiot proof. I didn&#x27;t change the way the razor was attached as shipped; this means I was shaving with the center piece upside down. None of the following criticisms are true, but I will leave it up in case other boneheads make the same mistake. This is a great purchase and I now see what the fuss is about. Closest. Shave. Ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very excited about jumping into the wet-shaving renaissance.  I ordered this razor and a pack of Feather blades with high hopes of a closer shave.  That didn&#x27;t happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in my 30s and do not have a heavy beard.  I used an electric razor for my everyday shaving and a disposable for the weekends.  I started liking the disposable shave better, as it was closer and my skin looked better after shaving.  I use Kiehl&#x27;s brushless shaving cream with excellent results.  I was already applying a warm cloth to my face prior to and and a cold cloth after my shave.  After reading the other reviews here and discussions other places, I was excited about going back to the basics with a double edged razor blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the enclosed blade first.  I braced myself for the nicks I read from other reviews.  Not only was my skin not cut, but my beard wasn&#x27;t either!  I tried different angles to no avail.  I waited a couple of days and tried a Feather blade.  A little better.  I tried again today and spent about 15 minutes trying to shave.  I felt I was doing less shaving and more scraping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Am I missing something?</li>
    <li> When you pick up this razor, you know you have a well-crafted tool in your hand. When you use it, it will only confirm your first thought.  Worth every penny, and over time, it will pay for itself.</li>
    <li> I was inspired by some of the other reviews of this product to buy a safety razor, even though I currently have a full beard. It doesn&#x27;t shave as closely as my mach 3, but that might just be because I need more practice. Holding the razor is a pleasure, the weight and feel of the razor let you know that this is a quality machine. Wet shaving is a new and zen-like experience to add to my morning routine. It&#x27;s not for everyone, but I certainly look forward to using this thing for many years to come.</li>
    <li> This was my first shot using a safety razor and I will never go back. One piece of advice if you just converted from disposable razors--buy good shaving cream. I got a $10 soap and brush from rite aid and it&#x27;s no better than the canned stuff. Absolutly worth th extra to get good soap!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I hated my gillette for giving me lots of razor burn and sandpaper stubble. This is a sturdy no-nonsense shaver that fits a large hand well. If you are new to shaving, then start with the angle and a very light touch. Pressure is what causes horrible bleeding; wait until you master the angling so it catches hairs, and start working on mastering the pressure after. I&#x27;ve only cut myself once as a complete newbie that way. Remarkably smooth cheeks, but it still struggles just underneath my chin where the gillette did. I imagine once I master pressure to angle it will have no problems. Works best with two shaves, one with the grain and one against.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have any other razors to compare this one to.  But I am very happy with the quality of shave it provides. I also enjoy the nostalgic feeling of the whole process, granted it does take longer to get a good shave but its not even comparable to the mediocre shave I would get with the cartridges ( and I have tried them all).  I wish I would had made the switch years ago.</li>
    <li> This is a good, sturdy, well-balanced razor. It feels nice in my hand, and it&#x27;s a pleasure to use. Using a safety razor for a wet shave with shaving soap is a lot better for my skin than any other &amp;#34;modern&amp;#34; shaving technique.</li>
    <li> I chose this razor because it is very good price and the silver is what I liked about it, and will be used more to save money on disposable razors</li>
    <li> Minimal and to the point. Worth the money for solid construction.</li>
    <li> SUCKS! WASTE OF TIME. THREW IT OUT</li>
    <li> I bought this razor a few months ago with some Feather and Merkur blades. It was my first attempt at wet shaving and double edge razor shaving. My life hasn&#x27;t been the same since. Since then shaving has become a joy - something I look forward to, rather than dread. It takes a bit more patience than multiblade cartridge razors, but the time is well worth it. Sometimes the old way is the best way. This is case in point.</li>
    <li> I will never go back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a learning curve with these safety razors, that&#x27;s a given. But if you do your research, take your time and follow the rules of shaving, you&#x27;ll do just fine. I&#x27;ve been using mine for a few weeks now and have yet to cut myself. This little gem is fantastic and makes the learning curve super easy. It feels super solid (solid metal) has a great heavy weight feel to it (compared to plastic razors) that gives it a high end elegant presence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Swapping blades is a synch as is cleaning when necessary. Take your time while shaving and this little beauty will do all the work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re thinking of swapping for whatever reason (save money, try some new/better) but are afraid you&#x27;re going to hack your face to pieces, don&#x27;t be. I was too, but I checked out some tutorials on youtube, learned a few techniques and dove right in and was very surprised at how simple it was.</li>
    <li> Most definitely a pleasant experience. Shaving was a breeze with this razor.  No cuts nicks and it left my face very smooth. Should have listened to my Dad years ago. Will never use those fancy new-fangled cartridges again.</li>
    <li> I replaced an old Gillette razor that I bought in about 1968 or so.  I was a little taken aback at first by the way the blade is inserted - the handle unscrews from the head which then separates into a top and bottom half and the blade is sandwiched in between - but once together it shaves very well.  Better than my old Gillette, actually.  The only thing that prevented me from giving it 5 stars is that I think the knurling on the handle could be a little more aggressive.</li>
    <li> Bought this wonderful razor because I was tired of paying for cartridges on my Gillette, and maybe because the idea of a safety razor is awesome.  The razor itself is perfect and gives a very nice shave.  Being metal, the razor sheath doesn&#x27;t drag nearly as bad as the rubber stripped Gillette Fusion Pro Glide.  My skin is much less irritated, although there is one minor flaw.  The razor lends itself to causing more nicks than modern razors do.  However, the nicks tend to be much smaller, and usually heal overnight (I shave before bed.)</li>
    <li> Made the switch and will never go back</li>
    <li> I would definitely buy this again. Great razor</li>
    <li> I love this razor. It feels great in my hand and has a nice weight to it that makes shaving super easy.</li>
    <li> Works awesome. It&#x27;s the perfect weight for me and gives a wonderful shave.</li>
    <li> Nothing fancy straight forwar and reliable. Cost of blades are very reasonable and I have requment ti to my friends.</li>
    <li> Just got into shaving differently and I&#x27;m actually enjoying it. Haven&#x27;t cut my face or anything like other people have said. Shave confidently and the razor will work perfect. Impress the ladies...</li>
    <li> It has Merkur&#x27;s quality but the design is questionable. The loading action for the razor has a clumsy real basic design. It&#x27;s well built and will definitely outlast you. If you want to buy want and are on a budget this will do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have an extra 10$ then I would recommend that you go for the Merkur #34C. The loading action on the #34 is top of the line for the price. In any case, I would definitely recommend this product to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it four stars because I simply did not like the loading action for the razor. I felt that for 30$ they could have done a better job on its design.</li>
    <li> Not sure what to write about this shaver. The balance is very good. I have a Edwin Jagger. It does not have the balance of this shaver, but I like the Jagger better, I like the shave better I is closer. No Idea why.</li>
    <li> After reading reviews of a few razors in the $20-$60 range, this one seemed the best buy for a beginner.  I must say that I&#x27;m thoroughly impressed with the razor.  It delivers a great shave and is a solid simple piece of technology.  I will never buy any of the modern garbage that the razor companies are hawking as the latest and greatest.  Do your face, your wallet, and the landfill a favor and buy an old safety razor and if you&#x27;re looking for your first, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
    <li> Great razor, easy to change blades, much less expensive to buy blades for this.  Purchased one for myself, one for husband.  A little bit of a learning curve for ladies shaving legs, but well worth it in the end.  Have also purchased for two friends as gifts, everyone loves it!</li>
    <li> This product got a lot of good reviews so I ordered it.  But this one is a defect.  The razor does not cut anything. The blade is so sandwiched in between the metals so it does not leave any gaps for hairs to be cut.  So for me this was not worth the price I paid for.  I am sending back.</li>
    <li> This was as advertised and I love it</li>
    <li> This is a review coming from someone who switched from using cartridge, multi-blade razors to a safety razor.    OVERVIEW    If you&#x27;re the kind of guy who just wants your shave to be finished, look elsewhere. This is something you need to take your time with and use a little care as you get used to using it. However, if you think shaving is a way for you to take a little \\&quot;me\\&quot; time, someone has purchased a nice shaving brush for you and you enjoy slowing down before your day starts or after it ends, this might be something you should buy.    While other reviewers have suggested it&#x27;s easy to hurt yourself with this razor and a dual-edged blade, I&#x27;ve found the experience to be quite the opposite: If you don&#x27;t have the angle correct, this isn&#x27;t going to cut at all. The protective comb under the blade prevents any kind of serious injury unless you graze over a pimple or something. Take your time, breathe a little and you&#x27;re not going to hurt yourself.    I&#x27;ve been using this razor for about a month now and don&#x27;t have any intention of going back to cartridge razors. This thing looks much nicer in your bathroom than a Mach 3 or any other kind of cartridge razor. Pair it with a nice chrome razor and brush stand, and you look like you&#x27;ve really got class.    But aesthetics aside, this thing performs. I like the shaves I get and I like the method better. In a hurried world, this is a nice way to relax the pace before or after you get started.    REASONS TO SWITCH    Well, I primarily made the move because I was tired of paying outrageous prices for cartridges that pack in more and more blades, along with lotion goo, indicator strips and all kinds of other foolishness. Paying $15 or more for four cartridges that might last a couple of weeks is absolutely absurd to me. But you might want to make the switch if you get frequent skin irritation or ingrown hairs from using a five-blade monstrosity. This razor has been more gentle on my skin than anything else I&#x27;ve used.    Look around for blades for this thing and you&#x27;ll be shocked at how much you&#x27;re saving. I got a pack of 30 razors for about $8. I&#x27;m a month into them and I probably won&#x27;t run out until the end of this year.     On top of that, the shaving creams you&#x27;ll probably use with this are pleasantly fragrant and last forever. I was tired of the gels or creams in cans that smell like nothing but aerosol. I bought a tub of Taylor of Old Bond Street sandalwood cream at the same time I got this razor - again, a month ago - and I&#x27;m not even halfway through it. I&#x27;m confident that I&#x27;ll be using this tub for at least a couple more months.    Overall, it&#x27;s more cost effective and it&#x27;s a way for you to enjoy your shaves rather than view them as a chore. I shave daily now because I like doing it and I&#x27;m not worried about the money I&#x27;m spending on blades and creme.    REASONS NOT TO SWITCH    If you just don&#x27;t feel like taking time to shave is something you want to do, don&#x27;t. The idea with these is slowly reducing hair on the surface of your skin, not all-out removal at once. You can get baby&#x27;s-butt smooth shaves, but expect to take about three passes or more.     WRAP UP    Great addition to any grooming routine if you like that sort of thing. I do, so I approve.</li>
    <li> Exellent!!! But remember this is not a butterfly razor but it is still Exellent!!!</li>
    <li> Been using for 3 years now - no problems, works great, no signs of wear or tear.  Excellent product.</li>
    <li> My brother loves his new safety razor. He didn&#x27;t like the blade that came with it. He says it&#x27;s basic and for beginners... Which is what he is lol. But he loves the rest of this razor</li>
    <li> I got fed up with buying expensive 3/4/5 blade razor blades that didn&#x27;t do the job. Not only would I very occasionally find 1 type that worked and then see it taken off the market; but they caused razor rash and if I ran my hand over my legs when I got chilled after bathing, heck, it felt like I might not as well have bothered. Big time stubble! Not only that, but I was shaving my forelegs twice a day eventually to try to get the smoothness that one expects from shaving, otherwise why bother? That got me all nostalgic for the 70&#x27;s when I&#x27;d use Dad&#x27;s schick razor and blades and my legs would feel silky smooth and razor bump free. (Sorry Dads, you know this happens with teenage girls!) I finally decided to do something about it. I read all the reviews I could about the safety razors, finally selecting this one. I love it! But - Warning! Do NOT use this razor when you&#x27;re already running 20 minutes late for whatever it is! Take your time. Enjoy the process and remember the goal. I also purchased a selection of blades like the guys have recommended and a 5 pack of Feathers. My biggest error was to try the Feathers blades first, thinking sharpest has to be bestest. DUH! Not a good idea at all! I figured it would be like riding a bike, right? Once learned, not forgotten? Wrong. I had developed very bad habits such as applying a lot of pressure to today&#x27;s razors in my rage to get at least a semblance of smoothness. Gentlemen reading this to this point are probably paling already - no learning curve, Feathers blades AND pressure. Very very bad move. Let me say that again.....Very very bad move. So much so, I was about to give up, figuring I&#x27;m a big idiot, but not a huge amount of money out of pocket. Then then I tried the Derby blades (among others, and I can tell you that the advice to buy a selection pack, or multi 5-packs of the most recommended brands is a must) Ahhhhhhh! What joy! The skin on my forelegs is too thin for Feathers, - at least until i master the technique,- but the Derby blades and this razor are perfect for me. No more shaving twice daily YEEEAAA! Gentleman, if you think shaving your face twice daily is a PITA, you can imagine what it is for the ladies to go through. My technique is soaking in a good warm bath, followed by a mild scrub of the legs with a loofah and soap. Then I use a shaving soap (still experimenting on the best one for that), combined with a little oil. The oil is very handy for me as it does really help to reduce razor bumps eventually to zero, particularly for the top of the legs/bikini lines. The razor is frankly marvelous. My legs are once again smooth and silky. Unscrew the razor and wipe both it and the blade dry after use. I can use the blade 3 times, which given that we&#x27;re talking 2 legs at a time here, is not only great, but a lot cheaper.  Just an afterthought to wind it up, - make sure you have the first bit of the base that connects to the pole the right way round :-) (that is, with the 2 sided \\&quot;comb\\&quot; facing outwards, or you&#x27;re not going to be very impressed. Conclusion - Ladies, make the change and get off of the high-priced, third-rate useless take it or leave it stuff that&#x27;s out there.</li>
    <li> excellent product for beginners or experienced</li>
    <li> This was my first razor of this style. I have been using disposable razors and liked them but figured try this out.  I like how heavy it feels when shaving and it is a lot easier to keep clean.  Razor blade changes are not as easy as I would like but it is fine.  I think I would try a butterfly style razor next time to compare but this one is really good as well.</li>
    <li> The razor blades were taken from the packaging so I&#x27;ve delayed using the razor.</li>
    <li> Awesome! Close shave easy to clean. I will never buy a disposable razor again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a *big* fan of this jobber.  Its high-quality build is at the sweet spot, distinctly above the *really* terrible models (Lords, Weishi&#x27;s, et al) but without straying into the realm of luxury models (Future, Vision, Muhle, D.R. Harris, et al).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether buying for yourself or buying as a gift, I&#x27;d strongly recommend getting anything less than this or an equivalent (Merkur 34c, EJ, etc), lest a low-quality razor unnecessarily turn the user off from wet shaving altogether.</li>
    <li> It is more difficult but much cleaner. A smooth shave with less expensive blade refills. Try it if you&#x27;re up for a challenge. Great product and time tested.</li>
    <li> This thing really works good. Its solidly constructed, looks cool standing in my cabinet and it really shaves better than those crappy chines made  plastic razors. I use the Merkur brand razors with mine so I can&#x27;t speak for any other brand right now. I&#x27;m getting one of these for my Dad and my brothers as gifts.&lt;br /&gt;I would say that it takes a little getting used to as far as the technique goes but it&#x27;s something that is easily mastered with just a little bit of practice.&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this razor, especially if you really dig the old school way of doing things like I do.&lt;br /&gt;As an added bonus your keeping allot of waste out of our landfils</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband after reading great reviews on it.  He loves it and it gives him a wonderfully smooth shave.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor and love it. I will never go back to mach 3&#x27;s or anything similar. I paired it with a feather blade and it gives me a great shave. No irritation, no problems. I highly recommend this razor even if you have sensitive skin. (Which I have) If you have a thicker beard I would recommend an open tooth design. Simply put, you can&#x27;t go wrong!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a high quality razor. It is nicely weighted, so it isn&#x27;t too light or too heavy. Easy to re-load and clean. Lovely attention to detail.</li>
    <li> I have been using this razor exclusively for two years so understand it well. It is of quality construction and beautiful, and I don&#x27;t doubt that it could last a lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my third safety razor, my other two being a Parker twist-to-open and a 1959 Gillette super speed. I had to ditch the parker because of poor quality, the blade sat in the holder at an angle which led to many bad cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can get a very good shave out of the Merkur 180, but have to put some effort to that end. This is a fairly aggressive razor, meaning that the guard sits a farther distance from the blade than a milder razor. This means that you can get a closer shave but run the risk of nicks if not careful. My Gillette super speed is by comparison much less aggressive. For the first several months getting used to the Merkur, I would sometimes get the cleanest most refreshing shave ever, and other times would get an awful shave with many cuts, bad razor burn and still feel rough. After weeks of experimenting with technique and going through different blades in my sampler pack I discovered the root cause of my problems were the posts that center the blade. They are too small and allow the blade to sit unevenly, so when you tighten down the handle, it has the potential to be clamped off-center. In this scenario, one side of the razor shaves nicely, the other cuts badly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I learned this, I have taken care to align the blade carefully and have gotten more consistent shaves. For me, the Feather blades work best. Astra, Sharks, and Merkur blades also treat me well. I have noticed this razor is fairly unforgiving of less quality blades and can get many nicks off some brands, esp. Wilkinson Sword. Beard prep is also of utmost importance: take a HOT shower and wash and rinse well getting lots of hot water on beard to soften it. I use Nutragena cream shave (have tried a dozen brands and found the slipperiest works the best). I shave with the grain and do a light second pass against the grain, rinsing in between. I have a very coarse beard but sensitive skin, so have to be careful in my technique. I figured out how to make the razor work for me, but feel that it shouldn&#x27;t be this finicky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason for the three stars is only because the posts that center the blade don&#x27;t center it. Really, its the most important function of a razor, to hold the blade squarely. It doesn&#x27;t do its basic job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little while back, I acquired my grandfathers old Gillette super speed and was blown away by how much easier it was to get a close shave with no nicks. This is from a 54 year old razor. The reason it works better is it grips the blade perfectly evenly and has a less aggressive blade position. Blades that I passed off as rubbish before shave well on the super speed. It was this discovery that prompted me to write this review, that when you find the right razor for your face, you will instantly know it. Prior to a few weeks ago, I thought the Merkur was great but trying something new made me realize how much effort it took to get a good shave. I&#x27;m not faulting the Merkur for not being right for me, but for bad blade positioning.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor, because I&#x27;m in the Army and stationed in Afghanistan and needed a better way to shave without tearing my face up every day.  Being deployed I must shave every day.  I don&#x27;t have the weekends anymore to let me recover.  Any way I was using the Quattro and would brutalize my face on a daily basis.  I tried different creams and all different types of razors.  I was pretty nervous after reading about the Safety Razors that I would hack my face up initially, but that wasn&#x27;t the case at all.  I did everything that everyone said to do to keep from doing it and it worked.  I have nicked my face maybe a handful of times during the first week of use, but towel no longer looks like the Japanese flag after I&#x27;m done shaving.  Great product and would recommend it to anyone.  Be sure to use a quality shaving soap or cream, it makes I difference too.  I use Taylor of Old Bond Street and its great as well.  Get the brush and mug to, it&#x27;s a great change from the cartridge razors.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving with this about 6 months since switching away from the Gillette Fusion. I made the move because I was increasingly annoyed by absurd razor prices. While it is much much cheaper to shave with a safety razor using normal blades, it is simply not as close a shave. I have coarse hair and the Gillette razor does a better job while letting me shave against the grain, which is the only way I can get a truly smooth shave. This is a lot rougher (cannot go against the grain), but is certainly acceptable for an okay shave.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. If you want to go old school and get a very close shave then this is the one. Besides it is so much cheaper than using the expensive cartridges from Gillette. I&#x27;ve never used a safety razor before and it&#x27;s really easy to use and never got a cut.</li>
    <li> This was my first double edge safety razor, and I am very satisfied. There are no directions provided with the product, but it&#x27;s pretty evident how to replace the blades. The weight is substantial and makes it very easy to \\&quot;let the razor do the work\\&quot;. The handle design makes it very easy to keep a gentle but firm grip. Lastly, the chrome finish is holding up strong 5 months after using the product. I can see how these razors last for so long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give it 5 stars if there was more of a design to the product. I know that&#x27;s picky, but 5 star ratings really should be reserved for those products that do a great job and look perfect.</li>
    <li> I have had this for a couple weeks now and I love it. Build quality feels great, The handle is long enough even for large hands like mine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 50 years old, always used a cartridge razor. I bought this razor because I&#x27;m tired of throwing away money.&lt;br /&gt;This is my first experience with this type of razor and I love it. Closest shave I ever had! It should pay for it self with in a couple months.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t matter can&#x27;t beat the shave! I will have to try different blades, but the one it came with is great.&lt;br /&gt;I remember my father used to use this kind of razor. Don&#x27;t know why he ever switched to a disposable razor!&lt;br /&gt;I will have to keep it hidden from my wife, if she tries it I&#x27;ll never see it again! Best bet is to buy her her own! GREAT RAZOR!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had skin issues, and what I found from dealing with electric razors, was that they made it worse.  So after a while, I began shaving with cartridge razors.  Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I feel like cartridge razors are expensive for the quality you get, and to top it off, you don&#x27;t feel really skilled shaving with a cartridge.  Sure they pivot, and have a bajillion blades, and claim to make your face feel as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom, but really, most of them are not the best a man can get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So with a little research online, I found a lot of people had switched to safety razors.  They tend to be cheaper, can get a close (if not closer) shave than a cartridge, and look really snazzy.  Plus eventually, I wanted to switch to a straight razor.  The Merkur kind of changed my mind about the switch, and I haven&#x27;t looked for a new razor since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+  The long handle allows for more control when shaving, allowing you to adjust the angle with your wrist.&lt;br /&gt;+  The blades are cheap!  Like 30 for $8 or less.  They seem to last about two weeks as you can use both sides on the razor.&lt;br /&gt;+  The stainless steel just looks plain sexy.  You can put it in any bathroom and look classy.&lt;br /&gt;+  The shave is really close after you learn how to handle a safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;+  Installing blades is a breeze, just unscrew, slide in, and screw it back together.&lt;br /&gt;+  The knurled handle is great for grip, and doesn&#x27;t slide while shaving, allowing for good control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons (most of these go away):&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s a real razor.  You can cut yourself super easy.  If you&#x27;re not familiar, prepare to have some nicks for a while.  An aftershave can help.&lt;br /&gt;- When you&#x27;re starting, budget a little extra time to get used to the motion.  Cartridges are forgiving, fixed blades aren&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;- Cleaning it can be tough, qtips are helpful for some of the intricate bits (if you want it to shine).&lt;br /&gt;- Biggest real problem though is with the TSA.  The razor itself is TSA approved, but blades will not go through.  If you want to travel with it, you have to check the blades.&lt;br /&gt;- It doesn&#x27;t pivot, but your wrist does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m completely satisfied with this razor.  I feel like a champion using it, it&#x27;s durable, cheap to maintain, and looks stylish.  Sure it could pivot, and be easier to clean, but for the vast majority of the time, it&#x27;s a wonderful experience for those looking to get a good safety razor.</li>
    <li> Easy, smooth and fast to use.  I do not apply much pressure and can get a clean shave in about 5 minutes with no cuts.  I use it with the Astra blades.  I will have to try it with the Merkur sample blade that came with it.</li>
    <li> Excellent razor. Good quality. I love the weight and control you have with this razor. Using this razor I have less nicks to my face.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor several years ago off Amazon, and loved it to death. It even survived an Afghan deployment. When I left it in a Vegas hotel room, I was severely depressed and knew I had to buy a replacement immediately. Unfortunately, my purchase experience this time around was a complete reversal of my last. Not only did I not receive the item within the two-day prime shipping window, but in addition, the razor wasn&#x27;t even a Merkur! I have attached some pictures to show the differences that were immediately apparent, as my brother owns the very same razor (on my recommendation; Merkur is on the bottom, new razor is on top. You can see the engravings on the actual Merkur and the lack of a hole at the bottom of the one I received). Although the razor has a nice hefty feel and looks nice, it has an issue when being placed into what I like to refer to as &amp;#34;travel mode&amp;#34; (razor is safe by reversing the guard), and feels like the holes are misaligned and the guard slightly bent, making it difficult to switch. I am rather disappointed as I don&#x27;t really feel like returning it and waiting another week to get my authentic Merkur that I payed good money for, so I suppose I will just look for a new seller and leave this review. My point: beware this seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Gonzo</li>
    <li> Not sure how much I will like it just recieved it and I will have to use it and get used to it. It is different than the one I have been using, but I sure I will love it.</li>
    <li> A fine quality razor.After the burn-in period, shaving with this becomes a breeze and you begin to wonder how did you do it all these years without this simple device. No, you don&#x27;t need to shave 5 times to get the same effect as with shaving with a Mach-5!. One blade, one time and done! No, you won&#x27;t nick yourself any more than with any of these modern razors. If you are not careful, you could get cut even with a butter knife.</li>
    <li> Not worth the money. Im a guy i love a close shave but i dont want to spend 15 minutes doing it sitting in the bathroom for ever like a female. Quattro titanium is much better and the blades last 2 times longer than fusion. So even though its $2.50 per razor it is actuslly $1.25 causr it last longet. U can shave in 2 minute and its perfectly smooth no irritation. So why all the trouble for a old tech safty razor... Its just a fad thank rick harrison for ur stupid commercial. If u are one of those people who sit on youtube watching shaving videos with saftey razors. And u have ur badger hair brush and shave soap and dont mind spending an extra 15 minutes every day shaving then yeah saving a few bucks might be worth it to u, fare warning using a saftey razor is not easy it must be held at exactky 45 degrees to cut so unless ur a pro it will take u even longer than 15 minutes. Even the mist adept saftey razor users take at least 10. Its a waste if tine shaving isnt fun! Its part of life for men so ti make it as quick and easy as possible is worth the $1.50 a week it costs.</li>
    <li> Simple with nice weight is great for shaving.  Seems to be very high quality and I look forward to having it for years to come.</li>
    <li> This is technically my 2nd DE razor.  I started classic shaving a couple of months ago after finding a pristine vintage Gillette in an antiques store.  It&#x27;s a short handled, adjustable &amp;#34;gap&amp;#34; model that I pretty much loved from day one.  So I thought that a brand new razor would surely be better and the Merkur Model 180 seems to be a kind of industry standard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a very good looking razor and certainly is of the highest quality build and workmanship.  It just plain doesn&#x27;t feel as good or shave anywhere near as close or comfortable as my other razor though.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week however and will continue to give it a chance.  But the 1st impression as a usable razor was far less than I expected from all of the hype and other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure it would be a great 1st razor for someone just getting in to classic shaving and maybe mine is just a case of loving what you started with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this as a 1st buy or as a gift.  I doubt I use mine much longer though.</li>
    <li> Never gonna buy another disposable or replacement head type razor again. Bought this for $33 and $14 5 pk of blades.  Enough for at least a yr.</li>
    <li> This is my second razor after a cheap one I bought six months ago. The construction is robust and solid. The quality of my shave went up a notch. I am very happy with this razor.</li>
    <li> The Merkur 180 (23c) is an awesome balanced razor just as everyone has said. Great value for $31-32. I previouslu had a butterfly or twist-to-open (TTO) razor from The Shaving Company, there is no comparison. After reading the Badger &amp; Blade forum, I decided on the Merkur 180, no regrets for the last 2 weeks, my sensitive skin could not be happier. The shaves rival those of straight edge razor shaves from a barber shave. Of course, shaving with a double edge razor takes skill and practice, just read the Badger &amp; Blade forums, I&#x27;ve yet to have a single cut. I&#x27;ve tried it with Persona, Merkur, and Astra blades; all work great. If you want a balanced long handle double edge razor, look no further. And if you&#x27;re still using cartridges, stop wasting your money and make the switch.</li>
    <li> Nice razor, fairly heavy and I like the longer handle. Simple to use and it will last forever. I went to safety razor shaving because the mach 3 blades were getting too expensive. I know the Merkur razor costs quite a bit to buy initially, but you save in the long run because the blades are so much cheaper. I&#x27;ve been shaving with it for about a year, and I can get a much closer shave with the Merkur and Feather brand blades than I ever could with the Mach 3. Definitely worth the money and I will never go back to Mach 3.</li>
    <li> So I am new to old school way of shaving,..just cold turkey&#x27;d cartridge shaver systems and switched to the Safe-T razor. I read up a lot and decided to go with Merkur and I have no regrets. For all the newbies just know this razor is heavy duty,..so when shaving get your technique up to par and allow the weight of the shaver to add any pressure to your face. Do not apply pressure using your hand, as you would with a Mach 3 or Power Fusion shaver sys. You&#x27;re going to love it!</li>
    <li> Sure it&#x27;s going to take you a bit of time to get used to shaving with this razor. Sure you&#x27;re going to get to experiment with different blades. Sure you&#x27;re going to save a BUNCH of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m waiting for Gillette to come out with a $25.00 blade for their new 20 blade razors.</li>
    <li> This is my first experience with safety razor shaving. I don&#x27;t have a job that requires me to shave. I hated to buy the disposable razors. Too expensive, and I never got a close shave with them, so I couldn&#x27;t justify using them. I just used a personal $12 battery powered razor/grooming tool, to get a close enough for me to care shave, and walked around with stubble all week. I bought this razor after watching and reading about safety razors, and will someday move on to straight razor shaving. But for now, I am very pleased with my Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor. My shave is close and smooth, and I enjoy shaving now. My 5 year-old grand-daughter told me I look younger now that I am shaving with this razor. I also feel more manly. Getting out of the shower, and setting up to shave is something I look forward to doing. I only have to shave 2-3 times per week, but it is an enjoyable experience to actually shave.</li>
    <li> Great razor!  The length of the handle and weight of this razor makes for a great shave.</li>
    <li> My first handle.  Works great to get started.</li>
    <li> This was my first razor I purchased to use with my wet shaving set up. And I still use this razor every day. Solid weight to it and seems to be holding up so far. The plating shows soap residue, so if you&#x27;re going to have company over, I recommend giving it a little buff to shine it up. But the razor itself works amazingly! I don&#x27;t see a reason to get another razor just yet and will keep using this one until it falls apart on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have had this for just over a year and have not regretted it once. Great razor for a very affordable price! Got a pack of free blades with it (which I have not bought more of, but they were free and did hold me over until some better blades showed up).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re new to wet shaving I highly recommend this razor as a beginner. If you end up not liking the hobby you aren&#x27;t out a whole lot of money.</li>
    <li> I just started using this product and I am thoroughly impressed. I&#x27;ve been using the Mach3 for years and didn&#x27;t like the idea of spending 3 dollars on something that probably costs around 10 cents to make. Going from a multiple blade system to this ends up paying for itself within a year and is significantly cheaper in the long run. I&#x27;m still getting used to shaving with this but even after the first few shaves I&#x27;m getting a closer shave than I did with the Mach 3.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor and fits well in the palm of my hand. It isn&#x27;t as long as a modern disposable but it fits just fine. The razor has a good weight as well. I&#x27;m not to thrilled with the sample blade that comes with it so I would recommend getting some other blades at the same time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving for over 17years, and have tried everything on the market over those years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From single blade, double blade, triple blade disposables, to electric shavers, to even the old fashioned straight edge razor blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pulling my hair out in frustration for years, as I could never find that perfect shave. Disposables wound up costing a ton of money (IE Mach 3) each month, Electric Razors would chew up my face/neck, and cost just as much, if not more than disposables to replace the parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Old Fashioned Straight Edge Razors require that you know how to sharpen them properly, and that you can invest the time and money required to master the craft. It is not as simple as buying a few wet stones and watching some how to videos as I sorely found out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So after years of trying products, here&#x27;s the formula that I&#x27;ve found to work for the best shave your ever going to have.  Even if you have sensitive skin and facial hair of iron like myself)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Saftey Razor&lt;br /&gt;(German Engineering At It&#x27;s Best)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feather Hi-Stainless Platinum Double Edge Razor Blades&lt;br /&gt;(Ultra Sharp, High Quality Blades that last a long time.

    <li> I am new to the concept of double-edged single blade safety razors. I am very pleased with the feel and functionality. I am enjoying the Art of Shaving. It reminds me of watching my Dad shave when I was a young boy. I would highly recommend the Merkur 180 to any man tired of throwing his money down the drain with disposables.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for a few months now, and it has been one of the smartest purchases I&#x27;ve made.      -As close a shave as any Mach 16-blade razor  -Money saved is money earned (5 packs of blades run $1-3, where as the Mach counterparts are $10+ in most areas)  -Solid design, stainless steal    The only hitch with this type of razor comes in the injuries sustained.  For me, and I know this isn&#x27;t always the case, but I cut myself quite a few times to learn how to properly use the razor.  Although that was a pain, now that I&#x27;ve become accustomed to the design and style I wouldn&#x27;t go back.      As a college student, budgets are tight and the amount this will save over the conventional razor it well worth the switch. Fully recommend to anyone who has interest.</li>
    <li> Nice Item! Fas6 Delivery!</li>
    <li> I have had this razor for a few years now and I&#x27;m still using the original blade it came with! I have bought this razor several times as a gift to family members and sung its praises to my friends and co-workers. It has a old school heavy weight to it that gives  that high quality feel. I get a closer shave with this and have never cut myself. Don&#x27;t be a chump buying the over priced razors plastic heads, get this and it will eventually pay for itself.</li>
    <li> I went cold turkey from a Schick Quattro to the Merkur 180 fitted with Feather blades. I used it to shave my mug this morning and am still alive to write this review! What a pleasure to shave - sure, it takes some getting used to and it is true - you want to maintain that 30deg blade angle, but this is not rocket scientist. Take your time, take a little pride in cleaning yourself up, and you&#x27;re going to look your bst (and save some serious funds over the long run). The 180 is well made, swapping in/our razors is a breeze and it has a deft weight to aide you in your daily task. Good luck!</li>
    <li> This razor has a medium aggressiveness, so for first time safety razor users, it&#x27;s actually really good. It does give a really close shave. The chrome head is pretty good looking, but no where close to as good looking overall as the Edwin Jagger de86bl[[ASIN:B003LW4L2W Edwin Jagger De89bl Double Edge Safety Razor Chrome Plated]]. Man, that razor is just gorgeous and so well made.   Overall I would suggest this razor, but I would definitely consider the Edwin Jagger first.</li>
    <li> I never leave feedback for most things I buy because they almost always are uninspiring.This Merkur 180 Long Handle razor has compelled me to write this review,it is superb. I have a friend who said he was sick of 3,4,5 blade junk plastic razors and was going the DE route,so that brought my own shaving routine into focus for me. I had always thought that  DE razors and straight blades of the past were handsome tools but only to be wielded by Sean Connery or Robert Stack. I remembered back to my first few adolescent attempts at using my father&#x27;s butterfly razor and the hatchet job I received. I thought sufficient time had passed(27 years) that I should re-evaluate the DE razor.    I went on line here at Amazon and just started looking. I kept seeing these glowing reviews and endorsements of this Merkur brand razor. I must have read 30 or 40 reviews,both good and the few bad. I like quality and I like simplicity of design and that is what drew me to the Merkur 180 Long Handle. The price of 32 bucks for something that I plan on using until my last shave on earth seems fair. I decided to get the 50 pack of Feather blades to accompany my razor purchase. I read the reviews of these holy terrors and decided that I would go right to the Big league.     I got my kit in only 4 days, and then I waited. I thought it would be a massacre the first time I put blade to face but after only putting a hot cloth on for a minute I just set about the task. The only advice I took was from the reviewers that said use no pressure and keep it at about 30 degrees,which incidentally is easy. I had a 5 day beard, I did not shower to soften it up, I used no baby oil or other \\&quot;skin prep\\&quot;, I just hand lathered my Van der Hagen deluxe soap into my face(it is an excellent product and cheap). I took my time waiting for the first cut to happen,it never did. All those people who say DE razors cut you are wrong. All those people who say Feather blades are dangerous are wrong. I proceeded to get THE BEST SHAVE I have had in my adult life.    All that being said I have noticed that there is a very real sub culture of shaving snobs. These are the guys telling you that you must buy these ridiculously expensive soaps,aftershave, brushes and the list goes on. I did buy the Colonel Conk model 775 Evernice stand and the 12.50 Tweezerman Brush.They cost around 32 bucks as well, and boy do they look good in my bathroom. I bought the brush knowing that it will improve my already outstanding results,and the stand is required to keep the kit in top form.Half the reason I went to DE razors is to save the obscene amount of money the bastards at Gillette are charging for an inferior product. I don&#x27;t want to give away my savings to some other culprit charging 17.00 for three  pucks of soap! What I am saying is it seems that there are people and companies out there trying to make this Gentleman&#x27;s Art into something much more complex (and expensive) than it is. The initial cash outlay for me was around 90 bucks for quality equipment that will last me for decades with pride of care. I plan on buying 100 packs of Feather blades for around 35 bucks that will last years. I feel like I have bought a Mercedes Benz V12 for the price of a Hyundai.     It is amazing that I feel so compelled to write this review,but I have been looking at a lot of things we modern people do and have come to the conclusion that MANY of the things that pass for progress are in fact a sideways if not backwards step. I hope this review will inspire you to look into this alternate shaving experience.   P.S.  As I write this 24 hours after my first Merkur shave my cheeks still feel baby smooth...amazing!</li>
    <li> First time purchasing a Merkur, over the years I&#x27;ve been using gillette which bad in quality compared to this razor. It takes at most five minutes to prepare, lather shaving gel or whatever your method is, and shave. I haven&#x27;t been cut using this blade whereas I&#x27;ve been cut several times using the others, namely gillette.</li>
    <li> No muss no fuss! Its a very nice razor. Merkur makes quality razors without a doubt. My first razor was a Parker 65R which wasn&#x27;t bad, but for 1 or 2 more dollars this razors has a better shave. I&#x27;m not sure exactly why, but it does. The best way to explain it is... Its like your favorite shoes with some comfortable gel inserts added. If you are comparing Parker and Merkur razors by price, \\&quot;treat\\&quot; your face for a couple extra dollars! The long (4\\&quot;) handle makes for a solid grip. I think the 180 or the 38C are superior razors. They may not be twist-to-open or \\&quot;adjustable\\&quot;, but its is classic styling that just works well. Like a good pocket knife, it does what it should and does it well! 99% of the DE wet shaving guys I know use or own a Merkur and there is a reason for that! If you are just looking to whack some beard stubble, grab a disposable. If you are looking for pleasurable shave GET A MERKUR!!! If nothing else it will save you money over the multi-blade thieves, and it is much \\&quot;greener\\&quot; for the environment.</li>
    <li> This is my first Amazon review. I was so impressed with this razor that I stopped being lazy for a minute to actually write a one out. I received my model 180 today and experienced my very first shave with a safety razor. All I can say is, \\&quot;WOW\\&quot;! Closest shave I&#x27;ve had in my life. My girlfriend can&#x27;t stop touching my face to the point where it&#x27;s almost annoying... in an adorable way. This thing is sharp, easy to clean, easy to change the blade, nice weight, good grip on the handle, and it looks pretty suave too. Great deal for the money.</li>
    <li> This was my first Merkur razor. Started wet shaving about a month ago. I have since moved on and purchased a Merkur Progress and Futur. Also an Edwin Jagger DE89. So even though I&#x27;m a relative new comer I can make some intelligent comments because I can compare it to something in the same class. This is a work of art in addition to being a legitimate single blade DE razor. I have had no problems at all with this razor. No cuts bumps or anything at all. Just a close shave provided you use a good lather and do 2-4 passes going in different directions. My issue with this blade is it has problems getting the stubble in the neck area. My Progress does a better job. I only use the Feather stainless steel platinum blades. These are the sharpest so I have to be extra careful. I had better results with the higher settings on the Progress. It still leaves some neck stubble but less. Some of this may be due to my technique. I have to go side to side to get this stubborn hair. My neck hair grows side to side or horizontally and not vertically. Bottom line Merkur is one of the finest razor companies on the planet. If you need adjustability go with the Progress (long handle) or the Futur. What ever razor you use if you are a newbie you have to go slow and easy. Listen for the hair being cut. The Merkur 180 is an outstanding value and should get the job done for most wet shavers. And for god&#x27;s sake look at the YouTube videos on  wet shaving with DE razors. Very informative. Go slow and practice. Also experiment with different shaving creams soaps and oils. I&#x27;ll do separate reviews on the other Merkur razors.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been around long enough that this is the type of razor I started shaving with. Over the years I tried many kinds including electric razors. This razor will give you the best shave of your life. I ordered it thur Amazon and got it in no time at all. Good service and a good quality razor.</li>
    <li> Solid razor thus far. I can see this razor lasting me for decades and to heck with buying disposable razors ever again. Be a real man, throw out your disposable razor and purchase one of these if you haven&#x27;t yet.</li>
    <li> So far, I have had the best shaves with this razor.  Nothing like using a real blade to leave your skin smooth as silk.  Do yourself a favor and throw those disposables away and purchase this razor.  I wish I had a long time ago.</li>
    <li> I recently started manual shaving; tried various disposal and replaceable razors.  I used to love electric shaving for the convenience but thought about how much money I was spending for the convenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways; I&#x27;ve used this for about 3 weeks now and decided to chime in.  Do not believe in the single blade shaves &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; than multiblade and multiblade is just a gimmick.  Or multiblade gives a closer shave and such.  How good the shave is in sense of cut and closeness is dependent on the sharpness or the blade and angle you cut in.  Having said just that it all depends on how sharp the disposal blade you buy and the angle you hold this razor.  The Gillette&#x27;s out there kinda handles the angle for you and are pretty sharp but dulls fairly quickly for the price it&#x27;s a bit expensive.  This Merkur w/ its blades are as sharp also dulls fairly quickly but you do have to know to angle it right to get a decent shave.  First timers will need to get used to getting cut a little but at least it&#x27;s getting close :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The big disadvantage with a single blade is the coverage; you will spend a little more time going over the same area because you missed it unlike the multiblade.  But when the blade gets clogged it&#x27;s much easier to clean w/ this guy than the multiblades.  Also multiblades aren&#x27;t all made the same I tried various types to save money; the cheap orange Bic replaceable heads are horrible blades and even on first use is pretty bad.  Gillette is probably my favorite and even after a month the blades are still good but gets clogged way too much and replacements are outrageous in price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for the price I am definitely a single blade adopter and have ordered more blades; shaving kit and looking into a sharpening kit to keep some of the blades last even longer to see if it helps on subsequent shaves.</li>
    <li> The Merkur 180 is a semi aggressive razor. I use it to follow in my neck and chin area after the third pass with the Edwin Jagger 89 razor which is less aggressive(angle of blade is more bent down by razor head). The Edwin Jagger alone leaves some follicles. The combination of the two razors is an unbeatable combo for truly smooth skin.Merkur by itself is too aggressive and causes weepers. I am using Astra blades which give me 10 smooth clean shaves. Though not as sharp as the Feather,which gives me 7 shaves  before I drag and pull. Not as smooth. I keep both my razors loaded with the Astra. Tried all kinds of preshaves and soaps and settled on a combo of Col. Conk first and then Trufitt and Hill. Great lather. Col. Conk alone is good for the first minute but dries out fast.</li>
    <li> I got this razor in a Col.Conk set. Before this razor I&#x27;d been shaving with an English Parker. The Parker was nice but seemed to nick me quite a bit as it was not very forgiving. The Merkur is balanced perfectly and is easier to shave with. The only blades I will use is the Derbys. I&#x27;ve tried many baldes and the Derby is just so much better to me. You will not go wrong with this razor, just make sure you use QUALITY blades.</li>
    <li> Really nice razor for the price. The shine and polish on it alone is off the charts. The weight is really nice, it makes you feel like you actually using something that cost way more than what you paid for. Easy to use and easy to change out the blade. No complaints and no cuts thus far.</li>
    <li> Excellent razor! It has a nice finish, and a good weight to it. No complaints at all. I recommend reading the instructions that come with it to know how to clean it properly, and not damage the finish.</li>
    <li> I love this thing, I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now and have a ridiculously close shave. Almost no learning curve, and I haven&#x27;t cut myself at all yet. Match with a good shave soap and brush and you will love it. Plus the idea is just so completely classy.</li>
    <li> I purchased the razor and the matching razor blades.  Have not had any problems with the razor or the blades.</li>
    <li> coming from a Parker 22r I found the comb guard and sandwich style assembly on the Merkur considerably easier to rinse when shaving, it was a bit more aggressive than the Parker which I liked as well. Design was nice, lighter and easy to maneuver in my opinion. My single complaint was about 4 days after getting it I knocked it off my shaving mirror and the head came apart where the threaded piece connects to the top of the razor. I tried using super glue to reconnect it but it came back apart as soon as I reassembled it. After spending 30$+ on it having it lack the ability to survive one drop stung a bit when I only got to use it for less than a week. Beyond that I enjoyed it</li>
    <li> Works very well and much easier than I expected it to be. I was a little hesitant to touch it to my face but then quickly discovered that it is not difficult or dangerous to use in the slightest. I don&#x27;t use a badger brush and accessories to shave my face. I use a cold pressed coconut oil I got at Costco instead. I slather it on post shower and it works really well. I just have to wipe off the razor when I&#x27;m done because the water will not remove the coconut oil, for obvious reasons. In the end, I absolutely love this. I can&#x27;t believe it took me this long to switch from disposables!</li>
    <li> The item looks good but I used it not good, cannot touch my face closely</li>
    <li> This was a birthday gift for my boyfriend and he really loves it. He has thick, coarse, difficult to shave hair that grows like a weed and switching from a Mach 5 to this has defintely made life easier. I don&#x27;t know specifics since I&#x27;m not actually using this razor but I suggest any men who are experiencing skin irritation from shaving with a non-safety razor or who are sick of paying a ridiculous amount of money for blade refills check out razors similar to this one.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for our anniversary and its great he&#x27;s really excited about it! It came on time and in perfect condition I definitely recommend this for the great price it&#x27;s a great buy</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor to replace my Lord double edged razor and am so happy I did! The body is very heavy and well built. The head is chrome and has never shown any signs of rusting. Razor blades are easy to change (I use Merkur blades, my husband uses feather blades in his short handled Merkur). I will never go back to a disposable or multi-blade plastic razor again! This razor is a buy it for life item because it is so well built it should last many, many years.</li>
    <li> This was a xmas gift for my dad,  he was so excited. He really like the classic razor,  he said it gives him a closer shave. The sturdiness and lenght of the razor handle allows him to hold it without any effort.</li>
    <li> bought this as a gift for my boyfriend, he loves it. He has the closets shave I&#x27;ve ever seen him have, I love as well having him clean shaven.</li>
    <li> I guess I too had bought into the marketing hype, I&#x27;m sure the next thing will be a five bladed razor, one less refill in the packs and holding the price the same for the refills. Gone are the $10 refill packs with this razor. Low cost, SHARP blades for a real barbershop style shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay so the first couple days, I came out looking like I was attacked by a vampire. This morning, I figured out, NO pressure. Just use the weight of the head, and it&#x27;ll do the work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin, I can&#x27;t even use an electric razor, and have to use the special shaving creams. Well I got a tube of the Proraso for my birthday with this razor. Great stuff as well! I look forward to shaving now. It is amazing what I&#x27;ve been missing all of these years. Time will tell if I don&#x27;t get the ingrown hairs on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor doesn&#x27;t come with any directions, the only thing you need to know is that the handle loosens to open the head up to drop in the blades.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 21 years old so dont think im some old school person. This is one of the best investments i have made. I used to use the mach 3 then went to quattro then fusion. they always were close to the same shave none closer than the other and always seemed to clog up between the blades. i switched to classic de shaving about 3 months back and will never go back. One reason being how economical it is. i was paying from 2 to 4 dollars per cartridge before and now i have the bulk of the derby blades for 15 dollars for a 100. thats 15 cents a blade which will last about as long as the cartridges. The second reason is i get the same closeness of shave. If you are more experienced you can get a closer shave with different techniques. I&#x27;ve used merkur, schick, and derby blades. I so far like the derby the best but merkur was pretty good too. schick was probably the sharpest i used but it wasnt as comfortable. different people have different preferences. also to get a better shave you need to get a good brush and shaving soap or cream (not the gel but the old school proraso or w.e creams). trust me it actually somehow makes the shave better. i would suggest a decent badger brush and proraso cream bc of the colling effect it has. the razor itself is about as good as any other merkur razor, i got long fingers so i wanted the long handled, but ive used the classic and it was just the same. classic however is easier to maneuver. all i have to say is it takes a week or two to get used to shaving. learn about it watch tutorials it will help alot. classic sahving is a art and is perfected by practice.</li>
    <li> Including the sample one they sent. Also, the &#x27;twist on mechanism&#x27; is probably unsafe. Of course, don&#x27;t know for sure because blades don&#x27;t fit to try it....</li>
    <li> this is an pretty decent razor in its price range, however I don&#x27;t find it to be nearly aggressive enough. sure on a 3 pass wet shave it will get you pretty close but I find when traveling and using this razor I require a 4th pass to really &amp;#34;clean up&amp;#34;. Merkur makes a great product and at home I would never be without my Merkur &amp;#34;Futur&amp;#34;. Overall a good starting razor to help newbies to shaving get there feel down!</li>
    <li> Purchased this razor for my husband for Christmas and he seems to really like it.  It provides a nice close shave and should be less expensive in the long run instead of buying multiple razors.  We purchased the suggested Proraso pre shave cream too and have had no issues.  No regrets on this purchase!</li>
    <li> this is a great razor i love shaving with it. better then the mach 3 by miles. enjoy i do daily.</li>
    <li> I love the Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor.  It works great. I really like the old fashioned feel.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 49 years old.  When I started shaving, I used a safety razor like this.  After seeing so many good reviews, I decided to purchase one and try it again.  The result?  Now I remember why I left the old safety razor behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In comparison to the Gillette Sensor Excel, the only possible advantage I see with this razor is overall cost.  Here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The head of the Merkur is too big, and I found it almost impossible to shave up close under the nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. For me, the Merkur blade becomes dull after one use.  Since I would have to change the blade after each shave, I&#x27;m not convinced the cost savings are truly there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. In my opinion, the Merkur razor does not shave closer than the Sensor.  It seemed to me that the Sensor shaved much closer than the Merkur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. I found the Merkur very difficult to negotiate over the chin and jaw line and still maintain a close shave.  With the Sensor, chins and jaw lines are a piece of cake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. The Merkur must be held at the proper angle, and each time I allowed it to move just a bit sideways, I got a nasty cut.  Consequently, it took me twice as long to shave as it does with the Sensor because I was constantly having to monitor the shaving angle and I had to be diligent to prevent any sideways movement.  With the Sensor, it determines the shaving angle.  You put it against your face and pull it!  A nick or cut is almost impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I remember why I quit using a safety razor.  As far as I can see, technology won the battle of the razors long ago.  I&#x27;m going back to my Sensor Excel.  It&#x27;s worth the extra cost - if there is any.</li>
    <li> It took me about three shaves to get the hang of it but after that it was smooth sailing!!  I always shave while taking a shower.  I remember how my father used to do it and he showed me how to use it without getting any nicks, cuts nor rash!!  I&#x27;m 62 years old now and I&#x27;ll never go back to the costly modern shavers!!!</li>
    <li> I want a simple, quick, effective shave.  I don&#x27;t want to pay a lot for replacement blades or fancy shaving cream.  This razor is perfect for a man like me.  I was using plastic disposable razors and was unhappy with them, especially the multi-blade gimmicks that didn&#x27;t rinse off well.  This razor delivers simplicity and effectiveness.  It rinses off easily and works.  I use the cheapest shaving cream I can find, and new blades cost, at most, $0.70 each.  I get a close shave with minimal effort and expense.  This is an ideal razor.</li>
    <li> At first I thought this razor would be difficult to use since it&#x27;s one blade with no guides, but I was so wrong. My first time using this Merkur razor I got a great and close shave using a sharp but cheap blade. No more Gillette $20 blade replacement packs containing 5 cartridges, ever.</li>
    <li> Someone said if you&#x27;re on the fence about purchasing this, just do it. So I did. Been using it about a week and impressed with each shave. No nicks or cuts. Took me a couple runs to get used to holding it (Mantic59 videos were helpful) so it wasn&#x27;t until the third shave that I actually got some better results. Nice and clean and close.   I let the fourth shave grow out for 30 hours or so, there were no in-grown whiskers. I could never do that with the Gillette razor. If I didn&#x27;t get the whiskers shaved off every morning they&#x27;d start getting itchy, growing back under the skin. Ugh... I wish I would have thought about getting one of these years ago. My shave today was eight minutes. I was concerned this was going to add 20 minutes to my shave every morning but that just not the case.   Not sure how these things ever got out of popularity but I don&#x27;t see why I&#x27;d ever go back to a cartridge razor after using this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really glad I picked this up. I feel foolish for never even considering a safety razor in the first place, as I&#x27;ve bemoaned the price of traditional razors for years. This thing is easy to use, easy to clean and is made of a nice sturdy, heavy metal that doesn&#x27;t feel cheap or will break easily.</li>
    <li> The handle is the perfect length for holding and it works great!  Had another &#x27;normal&#x27; short handle razor and just couldn&#x27;t get used to it</li>
    <li> This razor is way overrated.  It is well made and will last one the rest of his life as opposed to my old gillette which only lasted about 20 years.  I do not like the weight nor the slant of the blade.  I thought this would really be good so ordered enough good blades to last me a long , long time but really find a Bic is more comfortable to use.  Wish I could have tried one before buying it.</li>
    <li> Purchased this razor in March of 2014 and it broke February of 2015 - I&#x27;d like to think a Merkur razor would last longer than 1 year.  The screw on the top of the razor broke when changing out the blade.  Very disappointed in this product.  Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> Best shaving tool i have used so far.</li>
    <li> This was my first ever safety razor and I have been super happy with it! Definitely great for beginners and most likely people that have used safety razors for a while as well. So glad I made the jump and not paying super expensive prices for Gillette razors anymore. I highly recommend this razor!</li>
    <li> Well... let me just put it out there.  I shaved, no hacked away at myself with this thing with the bottom part on upside down for about a week.  Yes, thats right, I had no idea how to setup, and wondered why there were so many 5 star reviews.  I just didnt get it, no matter how many times i tried, and no matter how many directions I passed, it did not cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I tried putting the bottom plate of the razor on upside down and, badabinggg, it cuts like a champ.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing is awesome, just make sure you&#x27;re not an idiot like me and set it up the right way.</li>
    <li> The Merkur 180 is a spectacular safety razor! Although it is my first, I can assure you that it is made extremely well. Lathering up your face, small concise strokes, smooth, soft skin... It&#x27;s an amazing experience!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose the 180 in order to have the longer grip since I was making the transition from Mach 12 or what have you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sample blade that was packaged was actually too sharp for my face (irritating) but luckily I did quite a bit of research on blades beforehand and ended up purchasing Derby Extra double edge blades.They have performed perfectly for my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just buy a Merkur and support this excellent business!</li>
    <li> After years of buying expensive cartridge razors I said &amp;#34;enough&amp;#34; and went old school with the safety razor. First use I had 3 nicks. 2nd use 1 knick. 3rd and 4th use NO NICKS. I have been converted.  It&#x27;s a great smooth shave and very inexpensive.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical at first with this razor. I was eagerly waiting for my razor to arrive and it did within a day or two I rushed into that bathroom to try it out with my 7am razors I bought along with it. I used some pre shave lotion and colonel conks shaving soap. I then preceded on to shave I noticed a tugging on my skin and I was not comfortable with my shave so I tried it a few more time and I still wasn&#x27;t happy about the tugging . so I went back to disposables and my razor burn and irritation and cuts and nicks returned so I decided id try it out again and I felt a slight tugging but stuck with it and now there&#x27;s no tugging and no razor burn or ingrown hairs I have nicked myself but I was in a hurry and must have turned the razor. You don&#x27;t need to press to hard at all with this razor if you have it positioned at the right angle with gentle strokes it does a brilliant job. I shave everyday in the morning and I still have no irritation great razor I will never make the mistake of going back to disposables again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 19 and never used anything other than cartridge and electric razors. But I heard these cause less razor burn so I finally got one. It works very well I received it earlier and already shaved my face with it perfectly, not a cut and it was a super close smooth shave too, better than any razors I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;ve still just used the merkur razor it came with but that works well and I&#x27;m thinking the derby and feathers I ordered will work even better guessing by reviews. Still haven&#x27;t tried shaving creams yet though, I just used water like with other razors.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor after being unhappy with a Parker 99R.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Merkur 180 is a fine piece of workmanship. The blade sits evenly within the holder. The long handle is easy to hold. The overall weight and feel are very good. I see no reason in buying another razor in the future if this one holds up, and I see no reason why it should not.</li>
    <li> Works great, I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B004SGKMA0 Derby Extra Double Edge Razor Blades, 100 Count]]&lt;br /&gt;I also purchased 100 double edge blades by Derby (Derby extra green box) for around $8.00.  1 blade has so far lasted through 3 shaves, and probably many more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing easily takes hair off, I don&#x27;t know what some people are complaining about, maybe they put the top on upside-down?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a video review of this product on my youtube channel, channel name elvisreviews</li>
    <li> Really, truly a great razor. I have been having the best shaves of my life with this blade.</li>
    <li> Could not get them to give me a close shave. Back to my old 5 blade razor.</li>
    <li> First razor so all I can say is that it works great and the build quality is high. For me it was a good entry into the world of safety razors shaving, and I can say it is a lower priced high quality choice if you&#x27;re in the same boat,prehaps even if it&#x27;s not your first.</li>
    <li> I have this long handled mekur and I am very satisfied.  I have several Parker shavers and a mekur futur(expensive) which I also like but this mekur gives me the closest and best shave I have had in a long time. I have ultra sensitive skin and a thick beard and if I follow the general rules (shave after shower/wet face with warm water/put on creme with a badger brush and wait for about 2 minutes/shave -follow the beard growth first and then against the grain- I get a close shave with little irritation that lasts all day.  I use non-alcohol creme and after shave and it works for me. The other razors are nice to use once in awhile but I really like this light, long-handled mekur the best.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to using a DE shaver, and this is my first one.  That being said, I have gathered that one is supposed to let the weight of the razor do the shaving, and my only beef with this razor is that the weight of the razor doesn&#x27;t quite seem to be enough.  I have to use a little bit of pressure.  I would have liked it if the head of the razor were a touch heavier.  I like everything else about this razor.</li>
    <li> This is my first razor, but i have to say I really like it especially for the price. I&#x27;m not sure how people are cutting themselves with this razor. I shave both my face and head with this thing and find myself getting less cuts with this razor than with a high end disposable. I&#x27;m also not really sure why someone would say that it takes longer with a safety razor. I can shave just as fast with this thing than any other razor. So if your thinking at all about getting one of these I have to highly recommend to just go ahead and buy it. especially if your looking to save some money by getting away from the outrageously expensive cartridge blades. I would recommend getting a razor sample pack with this so that you can find the right blade for yourself. Personally I have found I prefer Shark razor blades but everyone is different.</li>
    <li> I like the feel and balance of this razor. Also good quality I expect this to last a long time.</li>
    <li> After using this razor for a couple of weeks now, I can say that truly enjoy using it. It has a nice feel and size. I can&#x27;t imagine using a standard size handle as the handle on this one seems just the right length. I would recommend this razor to anyone looking to make the change to a safety razor without spending a small fortune. I saw one reviewer commenting that the razor was not durable. I guess time will tell. So far, No problems or complaints.</li>
    <li> Having put up with the razor cartridge and marketing for years since I&#x27;ve begun shaving, I got wide eyed when I recently ran out of cartridges.  I had grown a beard over the winter, and when it came time to shave it off for the spring thaw, I wasn&#x27;t happy with the $22 for 4 pack, or the $28 for 5 I had seen at the store.  I thought there had to be a better way, and indeed there is.    Having come to this product, and reading through the many glowing reviews it is hard to see that this is anything but a tremendous change in your shaving habits, and all for the best.  While I was satisfied with the gels you get at the store,  I shaved only as often as I had to, to avoid looking like a caveman.  It scraped and pulled more than shaved, and I put off shaving frequently.    As a born again shaver, I look forward to shaving as never before.  With the lightest amount of pressure, the safety razor cuts the hairs as smooth as can be.  After a week or two, you get in the groove of maintaining just the right consistency between airy foam and a thick lather, how to apply it with a badger brush[[ASIN:B000G647Y8 Tweezerman Men&#x27;s Shaving Brush]], and the joy of a good face full of skin.  Now I&#x27;m on to finding just the right soap, just the right razor blade, and eventually I&#x27;ll roll into getting just the right brush.  I&#x27;m one of those who is never quite satisfied, and is always on the hunt for something just slightly better than what you have.  Needless to say I am now a shaving soap and cream sampler junkie.  I&#x27;ve written and received samples from most of the major brands, and enjoy the wonderful smells from MamaBears soaps, Col Conks, Crabtree &amp; Evelyn, Trumpers, and the Body Shop.  Whether I am in the mood for a more masculine earthy, musky smell, or I feel like a light yet strong ginger lime or citrus there is always something close at hand.    Plainly put - I love the razor and the world it has opened up.  I now love shaving and this is easily my newest favorite hobby.  Merkurmakes an excellent razor - all of them.  They are all reasonably priced, and I had picked this one more because it was a long handle, for my long fingers and large hands, and most similar and easily transitioned from the world of the cartridge razor.  Perhaps someday I will pick up another model, or another brush, or another blade, but at the moment I am perfectly content knowing my purchase can easily last a lifetime.</li>
    <li> Merkur makes a great razor, and I&#x27;m glad I made the purchase!  I have yet to be disappointed.  I wondered how long it would take to get used to the double-edged safety razor (this being my first one).  I was getting a great shave from the first one.  Yes, I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for quite a while at double edge safety razors.  If you are reading this you probably have been too.  The biggest attraction for most people is the cost of blades.  There is no shortage of cartridge razor critics complaining about the cost of cartridge blades and the quality of the shave that they give.  There is a growing and very loyal following of people who swear by a return to the days of our fathers and gradfathers and an old fashioned safety razor shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In researching these razors you will find quite a few strong opinions about them.  Their fans will tell you that they are the closest, most comfortable and economical shaves you could ever get.  Their detractors will tell you that they can cause terrible razor burn and that you shave with one under the constant risk of slicing a portion of your face off.  Both positions are somewhat correct, and therfore both positions are somewhat wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first safety razor.  I decided to plunge into shaving with this kind of razor after going back and forth on whether it would be worth it.  A lot of purists say that shaving with this kind of razor is not a quick and easy shave.  It takes time to prepare to even start shaving and that you shave with one of these razors because you relish the preparation and enjoy a little &amp;#34;me time&amp;#34; in the ritual of shaving this way.  I do enjoy that ritual.  But I have found a few tricks and shortcts that making shaving with this razor just about as quick as shaving with any cartridge razor.  You do need to prepare to shave.  But that preparation is not much more involved than other shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That doesn&#x27;t mean you don&#x27;t need to pay attention with this razor.  It houses a razor blade that is designed to cut and will cut you as easily as it does your whiskers.  But, this razor is not a scalpel or guillotine waiting to murder you the first second you let your guard down.  When I started thinking about going to one of these razors, I asked my dad what he thought since I could remember him using these kinds of razors way back in the day.  His response was a cringe and the comment that I would cut my face off.  It was precisely that opinion that kept me from getting this razor sooner.  Like I said, you can cut yourself with this razor.  But it isn&#x27;t very likely so don&#x27;t let this issue keep you from enjoying this kind of shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO..what about the razor.  I like it and I think everyone who wants or likes to shave this way will too.  It is a reasonable length.  But long handled doesn&#x27;t mean a long razor.  It just means longer than other similar safety razors.  It is a bit shorter than most cartrdige razors you are familiar with.  It however has much better weight.  This helps when you shave with it as it is the weight on your face that helps you get a close shave.  Experts cotninuosly advise to let the razor &amp;#34;do the work&amp;#34;.  What they mean is allow the weight of the razor to do the work pressing on your face and cutting the whiskers.  I have tried this and found that even with a somewhat weighty razor like this, I need to do some of the work too.  I press the razor to ensure a close smooth shave.  The weight of this razor alone just isn&#x27;t enough to do all the work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor is solid.  It doesn&#x27;t have any loose parts or play within the head and blade.  Simply tighten the handle and it feels as though razor and blade are all one piece.  Loosen the handle, and the head comes apart and you replace the blade.  Simple, convenient and fail proof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is textured and gives a nice grip.  The head is rounded and holds the cutting edge of the blade in position for a nice shave without being that deadly edge that will fillet layers of skin from your face.  I think the recommended angle for these razor is 30 degrees with respect to handle and face.  The rounded head of this razor is wide and smooth and angled to give you the right angle while you shave.  You will be able to feel the head and blade as you make a pass.  Just correct with your wrist and the razor does its job nice and close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price of this razor isn&#x27;t bad.  Do any kind of research into these razors and one thing becomes very clear.  Merkur razors are considered some of the best, if not the best, made razors in the world.  This particular model is priced below many other comparable models and even some cheaper made competitors.  But you are buying the Merkur name and quality.  This is the perfect razor at a really good price, to start into the whole safety razor club.  And this razor is going to last you years, it&#x27;s that solid and clearly well made.  After buying and using this razor, I&#x27;m actually worried that I&#x27;ll never have to buy another razor again.  And there are a few other models out there that I&#x27;m interested in but cost more - so I didn&#x27;t buy one of them because I was cautious about how I would like shaving this way.  So I bought just about the cheapest razor made by the world&#x27;s best razor maker - and it just might be my last razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I am telling you without reservation, that if you are going to get into shaving with a safety razor, this is your razor.  But here are my tips and tricks that will help you have a clean comfortable shave and love this razor too.  I see a few people have given this razor less than great reviews because of razor burn etc.  I am here to tell you that this razor doesn&#x27;t give you razor burn - you and how you prepare your face give you razor burn.  I suffered with it for years on my neck - until I learned how to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  If you can, shave in the shower.  It&#x27;s the last thing I do in the shower.  Your face is warm and moist and clean.  If you shave at a sink, wet your face with lots of warm water.  Get it warm and relaxed and nice and wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  Get a facial brush.  While your fingers do work, a good face brush will help massage your face and the whiskers to stand up.  This is very important.  When the whickers stand up, they are easier to shave and cause you to use less pressure to get close.  This helps avoid the burn.  A brush also helps you create lots of lather which is also very important with this razor.  This also helps avoid the burn.  Purists will tell you that you should buy the best quality badger shaving brush you can afford.  I have tried them.  I didn&#x27;t like them.  They don&#x27;t do as a good a job of massaging your face and standing those whickers up - in my opinion.  But a small face brush like you can find at a beauty store or Bath and Body Works allows you to really massage and prepare with the lather.  And unlike badger brushes, they are cheap and nearly indestructable.  And no worries about properly drying them out between shaves.  Just leave it in the shower or next to the sink.  It will always be in a condition to lather you up again - badger brushes take a bit more care and in my opinion, just don&#x27;t massage and lather as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  Get a good shave cream.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with any Proraso products.  I LOVE the sandalwood.  Can smell it even a few hours after I shave.  It comes in a soap which is in a dish, or in a tube like toothpaste.  I use the tube version right now.  Simply take off the cap, but a bead of cream in your face brush, run it under a little warm water, and start massaging those whickers.  It&#x27;s just like loading up your toothbrush to brush your teeth.  But instead you brush your face.  It takes a minute or two to do.  Use more water as needed to get that lather going and smell the sandalwood.  A tube of this stuff will last you almost forever.  I am guessing that a tube of this stuff lasts me almost an entire year.  At $10, you can&#x27;t beat it.  Once you are lathered up, don&#x27;t rinse out your brush.  Leave it full of lather and simply set it aside.  It will be ready in case you need a little bit more lather to finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  Put the razor to work.  Shave like you have for years.Let your face and your fingers be your guide.  They will tell you if you are doing it right.  If your first shave isn&#x27;t close enough, lather up real well and do it again.  You will learn the best angle, track and pressure to shave your unique face.  Alternate both sides of the razor while you shave.  Then rinse with some water and shave some more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.  If you find that you missed a spot or that some areas aren&#x27;t as close as you would like, grab your face brush and lather those spots again.  Then just shave them again.  If you try to shave those spots real quick without lathering up, the razor will drag and skip rather than simply glide nice and smooth across your skin.  THIS WILL GIVE YOU A GOOD CASE OF RAZOR BURN.  This is also how you get cut in areas you wouldn&#x27;t expect a cut.  As long as your skin is wet and lathered, this razor is going to glide right over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6.  Rinse with warm water, dry off, and use some aftershave or balm.  I perosnally have made my own aftershave that I found works really well in avoiding irritation.  I got a small plastic spary bottle and put wintergreen scented rubbing alcohol and a little bit of witch hazel in it.  When I am done shaving, I just give my neck a quick spray, and then rub it on the rest of my face.  Simple, cheap and effective for preventing irritation.  I really like an aftershave balm from Burt&#x27;s Bees that I found.  It has a bergamot smell......fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So how about razor blades?  Well quite a few experts talk about how some blades are sharper than others and how some people find that certain brands of blades work better for them than others.  Based on everything I read, the reviews and the cost, I bought a 100 pack of Derby blades for this razor.  I like them so far.  They don&#x27;t seem to be too sharp, they cut great when they are new, and 100 blades will last me over a year.  Using just one blade a week means that $10 in razor blades will last me 2 years.  And to be honest, this razorand these blades shave so close that I can usually get away with 2 days per shave.  So how long will these blades last me?  3 years?  4?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking into getting into shaving with a safety razor, buy this razor.  It is great quality at a good price and you won&#x27;t regret the shaves you get from it.  If you already use safety razors, buy this razor.  You will like it as much if not more than your other razors and at this price, it makes a great second razor for travel, vacation etc.  Skip all the stuff from the purists about more expensive razors, blades and badger hair brushes.  This razor, a tube of Proraso and a face brush will change your life.  And it won&#x27;t take much longer than your regular shave but it will be the closest and most comfortable shave you have ever gotten.  For what amounts to be PENNIES a day given that this razor will last forvever, a tube of Prorasso and these blades will last for a year or more.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed........</li>
    <li> I have to shave daily and this razor is not only provides the best shave, but it makes shaving affordable! A pack of 10 blades goes for less than $2.00 (on average) and I only change my blade once a week! I&#x27;ve introduced a couple of buddies to this razor and every single one of them has loved it too! Most dudes are turned off by the blades (double edged safety razors) which come in packs of 10 and must be loaded into the razor, but they work way better than anything disposable on the market and I&#x27;ve tried every one of em. I have extremely sensitive skin and I took me forever to find a razor and cream that didnt tear up my face. If you buy the razor and blades be sure to get a good tube or cake of shave cream/soap. The only differece in shaving technigue with this style razor is that you dont press like you would with a conventional razor.      It&#x27;s not that great of a razor for shaving your body, but thats not really its intended use anyway.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this baby 4 times so far, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I haven&#x27;t cut myself shaving, and the razor unscrews into 3 pieces and a blade, making cleaning extremely easy. It&#x27;s a perfect size in the hand, all metal construction and great looking. The blade that comes with it is great as well, has stayed sharp after 4 uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As someone in their late teens, I look forward to using this razor for years to come, and with the solid build quality, I&#x27;m sure that extends well into my someday grey beard hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very glad I found wet shaving, after you buy the setup, blades cost somewhere around 15 cents each, which is legions cheaper than disposable razors and, from what I understand, better for your face as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All around, a great razor.</li>
    <li> All pros, no cons!!! ... not even the \\&quot;slow shaving\\&quot; comments. No more irritations, uneven shave, or slow shaving... First time I try a safety razor, and I find it very easy, clean and of course safe to use. Bought it along with 2 packs of 100 Derby blades, so no more waste of cash on shavers for a veeeery long time, years indeed!.</li>
    <li> After almost 30 years of shaving, I finally decided to try shaving with a dual-edge (DE) razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My beard:  A full beard that is very stiff after two days, especially around the chin and under the nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My current disposable of choice is/was the BIC Hybrid Disposable/System Triple Blade, which turned out to be a fantastic razor, so I&#x27;m using that for my DE comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used C.O. Bigelow Premium Shave Cream (Proraso) for years, and I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you visit various shaving websites, you&#x27;ll see exclamations of how \\&quot;shaving like your grandpa\\&quot; is the best thing since sliced bread.  Having never used a DE razor, I will admit that those kind of statements are part of the reason I switched.  That being said, let me state that shaving with a DE razor is no better than shaving with a quality disposable razor, so don&#x27;t believe the hype. I have tried various blades in the Merkur 180 before reaching this conclusion.  Currently I am using Personna DEs.  So If you want to get into shaving with a DE, do it because it&#x27;ll save you money in the long run, and because you&#x27;re not throwing plastic in the trash every month, not because you think it&#x27;ll give you a much closer shave than a disposable.  You should also realize that, at least in the beginning, it will take you longer to shave with a DE.  Part of this is due to nerves, the other is because you&#x27;re only shaving with a single blade, so multiple passes are required.  Once you gain confidence and finesse with the DE razor, your speed will increase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried any other safety razors yet, but I find the Merkur 180 to be very nicely weighted, with decent grip on the handle.  Blades are easy to load, but I think a butterfly opening razor might be even more convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh... I have yet to cut myself with this razor, regardless of the type of blade I have loaded. (knock on wood)</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor based on the overwhelming positive feedback it received on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my first DE safety razor. More are to follow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is what I like about this razor:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Build quality is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;2) It&#x27;s looks match that of much more expensive options.&lt;br /&gt;3) Matching accessories (i.e. stands etc.) were readily available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are not many things to dislike about this razor. If I had to change anything it would be the weight and the handle length (yes I know this is the \\&quot;long handled\\&quot; version). I find that I can&#x27;t use just the weight of the razor to shave my course beard. Also, the long handle just seems to get in the way when shaving at an appropriate angle and seems a bit overkill. I have large hands, but will probably go with a shorter handle on my next razor purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all I am not dissapointed with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone starting out with traditional wet shaving.</li>
    <li> I happened onto the idea of going back to a DE safety razor by accident.  My brother is one of those people who have everything in this world they ever want - so he is hard to choose gifts for.  I was doing research for gifts for him when I came across the resurgence of Wet Shaving and decided to try the DE approach again myself.    I had a Lady Gillette as a young lady when I first started shaving.  Like most people, I went with the newer devices as their marketing got my attention.  I have tried lots and lots of different razors over the years.  I noticed lately that I was never happy with how my legs felt after shaving with the &#x27;modern&#x27; multi-blade razors.  It seemed like I could feel stubble before I was finished drying off after a shower or bath.  And so my adventure began.  I recently bought a Lady Gillette in excellent condition on ebay, like I had as a young lady.  I also bought the Merkur 180, a badger&#x27;s brush, a shaving mug and some shaving cream.    My first time using the DE razors, I took a nice, hot bath - making it a pampering, spa-like event and used a different razor on each leg to compare the two.  I guess I used a little too much pressure because I nicked myself on both legs in front where the leg goes into the ankle.  I made sure to have a nice, protective lather on my skin before making a pass with the razor.  Both legs felt noticeably better with the DE razors than the multi-blade modern types I have used for several years.  But, the Merkur was closer and smoother than the Lady Gillette.  I used the Derby blade in both razors, so I was comparing apples to apples.  With the multi-blade razors, I could feel stubble as soon as I was finished shaving.  After shaving with the DE safety razor, I applied some nice spa-type lotion on my legs, and they felt great!    For my second time shaving, I shaved by the sink and used a stool to prop my leg on.  I filled the sink with hot water, and soaked the brush in hot water in the mug before making the lather.  I used a hot face cloth to wet my leg and lathered it up.  I took care with the pressure and angle of the blade, going with the grain for the first pass.  Between passes, I wiped my leg with the hot face cloth and again applied the lather with the brush.  I have to say that the brush and lather were still warm, and boy it felt good, made me feel pampered.  The second pass was against the grain, and produced a very smooth result.  After shaving each leg, I ran the face cloth in cold water and wiped my leg to close the pores, applied some nice lotion and my legs felt baby smooth.  I made fresh, hot lather for each leg.  No nicks or irritation and I am quite happy with the shave.    I am going to stick with my Merkur safety razor and pamper myself a bit when I have to shave.  It is absolutely worth the time I invested.  I preferred shaving at the sink.  I think I was more focused on what I was doing and got a better shave.  I am sitting here with my legs up on the ottoman and I keep rubbing one leg on the other, just amazed at how soft and smooth they are!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice piece of hardware.  It feels sturdy and it is very easy to use.  But the quality of the shave you get is really determined by the blade you use.</li>
    <li> Before purchasing this razor, I had never used a DE razor. I grew up using Gillette cartridge systems from my first shave on till this. I gotta say I was really nervous about spending the money to buy this razor and the stuff needed to convert. After reading all the reviews several times over several months, I decided to give it a shot so I ordered it.   This item was packaged and shipped as expected so no complaints there. I received the razor on time, opened the razor and was amazed at the quality difference between the way this was made vs. the plastic ones now days. I bought a cheap shaving brush from walgreens and a puck of shaving soap there as well. I was so impressed with the shave I was telling all my friends about it, my wife even used it on her legs. I will not say it changed my life or made me younger but i will say everyone should try it once and I dont believe you will ever go back to the \\&quot;goo\\&quot; in a can and expensive cartridges again. Blade refills, the good ones are only about 50 cents or less in bulk vs. the 2.50 to 3.00 cartridges, there are even blade refills you can find in the 12 to 20 cents a piece range.   I have had this razor a year to the date today, I wanted to give myself plenty of time of using this razor before leaving a review. The razor still looks the same as the day I got it, it cleans up easy and I have had no issues with the plating peeling off or anything like that. I am still using the original pack of 10 feather blades that I ordered with it, these blades seem to last much longer in my opinion than the cartridge systems. I bought one for my father in law for his birthday and he loves it. These razors take some getting use to but well worth the investment and time. Not that I am endorsing this razor but You will have to pry this razor from my cold dead hands. I will NEVER go back to goo in a can creams and cartridges again! I used to hate shaving and I will say that I honestly kinda look forward to it.</li>
    <li> Love this shaver. I have been using it for over a year and had no problems. The handle is long(ish) which is great because my hands are fairly large.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I was looking for something that would do just as good as my straight razor but would be faster and I got exactly want I wanted.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas, he hasn&#x27;t used it yet, but I already took it out to play with it.  It is beautiful and heavy.  The material it&#x27;s made of is strong and seems like good quality.</li>
    <li> Bought it a month ago, have not cut my self yet and still on my first blade,  It always griped my butt to spend so much on disposable razors,  try it I think you will be glad you did.</li>
    <li> Its great buy one. It has a nice feel in the hand like it will last forever. The head of the razor glides over my face very smooth, easy to keep a good angle for a close shave. And very easy to clean. Buy One Of These.....</li>
    <li> Husband has used it for the last year with great results!!! Will not use anything different every again!!!</li>
    <li> Wanting a better shave experience , learning and shaving on the disposables for 20 years, I found this razor, and with a little practice it produced a better shaving experience than I had in so many years. This razor brings an aura of old school with the performance of new technology. If you are considering a new twist to the same old shave I would recommend this razor as a great starting point.</li>
    <li> This was my first transition into wet shaving and this razor is extremely high quality. I can tell that this is a product that was built with quality in mind and I am sure that this razor will outlast me. The transition has been excellent and I cannot recommend wet shaving enough. The initial investment can be high but over time it certainly pays off, and if you take your time the shaving is unparalleled. With cartridges I always felt the need to overuse them until they never gave a good shave but with the price of blades now I feel no need to use one more than 2 or 3 times. I cannot recommend this razor enough.</li>
    <li> Pretty standard razor and made with nice quality, I use this and I have the slanted razor for when I go without shaving for 4-5 days.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s no lubricating strip, or five blades, but this Merkur delivers the best (i.e. closest and most comfortable) shave that there is out there (save for a highly tuned straight razor).  Despite the wicked sharpness of the double edged blades, this handle provides an unbelievable amount of safety. The angle that it holds the blade at as well as the guards (above and below the blade) are perfect. I&#x27;ve bought a couple as gifts for others.</li>
    <li> I have tried many types and brands of razors, including electric.  This is by far the best shave yet and definitely an art form. Takes aa little longer to shave but well worth it.</li>
    <li> in comparison to ej razor feel is lighter almost comparable to mach proglide razor in length. Quality is ok will last a long time.  comes down to personal taste, I prefer ej for its heft and plating feels more substantial in hand.</li>
    <li> This is a classic shaver like your dad used to have.  I cut myself several times, but my dad was never there to show me how to shave.  I learned from TV commercials.  I take away only one star because I would like there to be instructions included not just for shaving with this, but assembling it.</li>
    <li> This product could, when properly loaded with a high-quality doubled-sided safety razor, trim the peach fuzz from an angel&#x27;s ass. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I am responsible for a proliferation of these shavers within my extended family.  Both men and women use them and love them.  You will too.  Grab some Dorco Stainless Steel razor blades to go with it.</li>
    <li> After the initial investment, I have spent around $1.50 on razor blades. Cartridge razors are for suckers. Buy this and save on your shave.</li>
    <li> Before purchasing this razor I used merkur vision. I think this one is much easier to use and maintain or clean. Very nice combination with merkur blades. Thumbs up.</li>
    <li> read the reviews...its what I expected and shaves the best....highly recommend it...been almost two months and I&#x27;m still on the same blade......if you want to upgrade and save money at the same time this is it</li>
    <li> With 40 years shaving experience, I think it is an excellent razor. I sampled the short handle model but prefer the long handle as this is.</li>
    <li> Just started back shaving with a straight razor after over thirty years of using an electric Braun shaver. I just wanted to change and get a closer shave. So I bought this model after reading many reviews online. Results have been very good after 3 weeks. Good quality well made safety razor. The blade fits in the razor securely and at the correct angle. No nicks or cuts yet. Nice long handle that allows me to hold the razor at the correct angle and glides on the face very smoothly. I would highly recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> First, let me say this razor is fantastic.  It gives a nice smooth shave every time with no skin irritation and no pulling.  I am still using the original blade that came with the razor and so far it&#x27;s still quite sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever since high school I&#x27;ve used either cartridge razors or electric razors and always dreaded it.  None of them ever gave a good shave and it always hurt.  Every electric or cartridge razor I&#x27;ve ever used feels like it&#x27;s ripping my hair out rather than cutting the hair.  This one gives a nice smooth shave and actually cuts the hair without any pulling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have to offer one minor point of disagreement with a lot of the comments I&#x27;ve seen here though.  Most seem to recommend not applying any pressure to the blade.  I tried that and found that there was quite a bit of pulling on the hairs rather than just cutting them if I did that.  Maybe just an issue if you have course hair, not sure.  Don&#x27;t be afraid to apply a bit of pressure if you feel the blade pulling a little.  It&#x27;s almost impossible to cut yourself with this thing, and I frequently shave in the shower by touch alone, with no mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did try a badger brush and some sandalwood shaving cream and it does give a nicer shaving experience.  It smells good, and lathering up with the badger brush just feels good, but if you&#x27;re on a budget they&#x27;re really not necessary.  I shave with the same body wash I use in the shower most of the time and it works fine.</li>
    <li> This is a nice razor handle.  I wanted the kind my dad had when I was growing up, the kind that opened up and not unscrewed.  I could not find that kind, but this works well enough.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a &amp;#34;real razor&amp;#34;, because all the disposable razors now come with some carcinogenic lotion crap. I couldn&#x27;t believe I couldn&#x27;t find one disposable without this stuff. This razor is elegant in it&#x27;s simple construction,ease of use, and attractiveness.</li>
    <li> Just received and tried out this razor and love it! No cuts first time out and it gives as good or better a shave than any disposable. How are we as a society spending so much on disposable razors when a year&#x27;s worth of blades cost less than one disposable cartridge?  The handle is well balanced and the only gripe I would have is that the bottom plate can easily be installed the wrong way the first time. Never going back to disposables.</li>
    <li> This razor is awesome, much better shave than with a 5-blade cartridge razor, and no razor burn.  High quality DE Razor at an affordable price.  Will recommend this product to friends.</li>
    <li> awesome. no complaints. very well made. easy to shave with. never had a safety razor before. got the derby blades 100 pack with it. gonna last forever. dont have to spend so much money on blades anymore!</li>
    <li> This was my second DE razor purchase, after using a &lt;$10 DE to decide whether or not I liked wet shaving. All I can say is that the quality and craftsmanship differences between these two razors are outstanding. The Merkur 180 is considerably heavier and thicker than the cheap razor and the benefit of this is clearly visible when shaving. I get closer, more consistent and all-around better shaves with this razor. The long handle, when gripped at the end, discourages the user from applying any pressure, which can cause irritation. I would strongly recommend this as a starter razor for those interested in wet shaving; after all, a few months of using a DE will pay for the razor and help keep money in your pocket!</li>
    <li> The base unscrews from the top, which then easily falls apart to replace the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, there&#x27;s no way to unscrew it without putting your thumb scarily close to the blade and then applying lots of pressure, or grabbing the outer edge (where the blades I use hang out a millimeter or so)-  uncomfortable, but at least it&#x27;s not dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except for an inconvenient blade change, this thing&#x27;s perfect.  However, I&#x27;ve done some more research since, and there are plenty of razors where you don&#x27;t ever have to grab the head to change a blade.  I wish I&#x27;d gone with one of those.</li>
    <li> Wow! What an excellent shave. Quite honestly didn&#x27;t know what to expect. Been using the typical disposable 3/4 blade razor for 30 years. Shave in the shower with just soap - no special shaving cream. Close shave no irritation and no cuts (which was my major concern). Switch. You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> Razor feels nice and is decent quality. It&#x27;s very easy to change a blade. You&#x27;ll get as good a shave (or better) as a Mach for a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> Excellent feel in the hand, well balanced and well made. I learned to shave with a double edge and like most over the years switched to the cartridge shavers that seem to get more expensive every other month. I bought the razor and 100 pack of Wilkinson blades. Assuming I use a blade a week, I should save (at today&#x27;s prices), about $360 over that time frame. Take out the cost of the razor itself and I still expect to save over $300 in 2 years.  I have been shaving with it for almost 2 weeks and the shave is not noticeably different than the cartridge shave.</li>
    <li> Granted, this is my first safety razor, but I really love this one. I can&#x27;t say enough about it. It is the closest shave I have ever had. I have no complaints and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good shave.</li>
    <li> I removed my full beard, which I had for thirty years, a couple of years ago and have been using disposible razors. I have never found one that would give me a satisfactory shave, so I decided to buy an old fashioned one, like I had when I was young. I am now completely satisfied with the shaving experience. Thanks !!!</li>
    <li> This was my first DE razor.  Awesome. My dad uses one like this too. I got tired of spending too much money on the gill Ettes and went old school. Love it. Took a min to get used to the whole wet shaving thing, but i got it down now. Will never go back. O yeah, wife thinks i look cool using it.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor after reading a few reviews. After a short learning curve (following decades of cartridges), I LOVE this razor. It&#x27;s weight makes the blades shave close with no additional pressure ever needed. It just feels good in my hand and it&#x27;s effortless on my face. Easy and consistent loading and unloading with fast cleanup. If you&#x27;re a cartridge guy looking to make the move into wet shaving, this is the razor I&#x27;d recommend. Invest in a good brush and soap combo, with a stand. Here&#x27;s the combo I got, and I&#x27;ve been thrilled with them: [...]. One more thing: get these blades, &#x27;cause I just discovered how much better they are than any others I&#x27;ve used: [...]</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this a few times now and find it gives me as close a shave as the 2/3/4 blade disposables.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do keep some 2 blade disposables handy for some tight spots (under the nose) to eliminate the potential for annoying nicks and cuts (which I have yet to experience).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read one of the reviews which said this was the better choice as it does not allow the blade to move at all when installed properly and therefore cuts down on the potential for nicks/cuts.  After installing a blade for the first time, I can attribute to this as I attempted to move the blade using some tweezers and it was firmly locked in place.</li>
    <li> I used to shave with a DE razor into my 20&#x27;s when the newer more expensive kind came into fashion.  Into my 40&#x27;s I was tired of being scammed by the razor companies so I went on ebay and bought a cheap WESCHI or something to that effect.  It was light weight and aluminum but it got the job done and saved me tons of money the past couple of years.  I decided I wanted a heavier one and purchased this.  NIGHT and DAY difference.  This razor actually has weight and factors into the shave.  It feels like an actual shaving tool and I actually look forward to my morning shave now.  I did one pass with my Lord Platinums and new TOB Sandalwood and was done.  Not a nick one either.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent razor base, cheap and haven&#x27;t cut myself yet, used over 10 times. No razor burn either, only used the original merkur blade so far will update.</li>
    <li> As this is my first razor, I wasn&#x27;t sure at first how to write a review as I have nothing to compare it to.  After shaving a few times however, I can say with confidence that this razor performs great and looks sharp.  My first shave with the Merkur razor blade that was included went ok...  I ended up pressing to hard on my neck and cut myself up pretty bad.  I felt like I had made a mistake in switching over to this whole DE business.  However, after watching more videos on how to whip up lather and shave properly, my last couple shaves were nothing short of amazing!  It doesn&#x27;t take long to get the hang of it, just don&#x27;t press down on the razor!  It really does do all the work for you.  It makes shaving more of a desired ritual than a task, and I feel good knowing I am saving money and going green at the same time.  Love it!</li>
    <li> My sons really enjoyed the novelty of olf school shaving, and were pleased with this device, until they decided to grow beards.</li>
    <li> if you don&#x27;t have thick beard hair, not the tool for you.</li>
    <li> Great razor for a great price!</li>
    <li> Top heavy not well balanced.</li>
    <li> German craftsmanship and a great shave to boot. Just like the old days for those that remember shaving before the plastic crap came along.</li>
    <li> This razor shaves better than the expensive 5 blade razors.  Great investment.  I suggest getting the assortment package of blades with it so you can judge for yourself the best blade.</li>
    <li> My husband switched to this and got the best shave of his life.  Great construction and feel good in the hand.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> My husband is glad that I bought this for him and is glad to finally stop giving his money to the Gilette Cartel. We were going to go with the dollar shave club, but he said he wanted to try one of these bad boys. He loves that it&#x27;s easy to use and clean, no corrosion after over a year of daily use and he said the weight feels good in his hand. He likes that the handle allows for a sturdy grip and it consistently delivers the best shave he&#x27;s ever gotten.</li>
    <li> This is a great safety razor!  It is lite and feels comfortable in the hand.  Don&#x27;t have to apply a lot of pressure on the razor to get it to cut and the shave is close.  The changing of the blade is easy and fast.  Have been using it close to three years and well not use anything else.  If you are using a disposable razor now, ditch them and buy this razor.  In the long run, both your skin and your wallet will thank you. This razor is well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I returned it immediately, not worth the money, I wanted an adjustable one and this one is very cheaply made</li>
    <li> This is a well made razor. It&#x27;s solid, durable, impressive and easy to clean. Shines right up after use. I can see where I could get some very long use. I liked it so much I bought two others for my sons.&lt;br /&gt;If your still using plastic razors your wasting your money. I always get a clean smooth shave from this razor.</li>
    <li> Nice razor well made. However, it was discovered extra caution was required with the use of this razor. A very light touch when using this razor would be my suggestion. It was prone to nicks and cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps these nicks and cuts were my fault due to not using a safety razor for so many years. Also, I was a tad unhappy with taking this razor completely apart to insert a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See comments on the Parker Safety Razor.</li>
    <li> I like this razor. The quality is acceptable and does what I expected. It does pull just a bit when shaving your legs but not constantly. I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> Thought this would be a step up from the plastic razors from shave.com which do not hold onto the blade well. But the shave is not at all closer and this thing has the added benefit of possibly slicing your fingers if you forget how to change the blade.</li>
    <li> Like the quality....first rate...well balanced. This is the way way products used to be made only better...nice to know this type of product is still available</li>
    <li> I am new to the double edge shaving game and wanted a quality razor for a good price. Based on previous reviews, this razor seems to fit the bill. The Merkur has an aesthetic appeal that puts my Mach 3 to shame. It feels a little heavy in the hand, but in a good way, unlike today&#x27;s more traditional razors. The weight distribution is also amazing. So far, I have shaved with the razor several times. The first time I had a moderate amount of stubble so I had to shave with the hair grain then against it to get a close shave. The blade caused minimal irritation under my neck without any nicks/cuts. I suspect the irritation is related to me learning to angle it correctly, using the supplied Merkur blade and my face is still adapting to the different form (art) of shaving. After the initial shave, the irritation has been progressively decreasing. The end results have been a shave as smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt, as my wife phrased it, every time. I have ordered some Feather blades as a replacement because I have become more comfortable with the razor and feel that I am ready to step up to the big leagues in terms of blades. Also, I hope it will help to further relieve the irritation under my neck. On a side note, my wife shaved her legs with the Merkur and they are now silky smooth. She tends to get irritation after shaving, but she had no problems with it after shaving with the Merkur. We both found this surprising because she has very sensitive skin. I may have to buy a second Merkur soon because I have a feeling my wife is about to steal mine. Based on this, I think females can equally benefit from a quality double edge shave. I guess the older generations really had shaving perfected, but unfortunately Gillette caused us to stray from safety razors back in WW II when they started distributing disposable razors to the troops abroad. Anyhow, make sure to take proper care of the razor too. I like to rinse it off then dip it in mineral oil to keep the razor lubricated and to prevent the blade from oxidizing. In summary, this is a great razor for noobs to double edge shaving and I highly recommend it (wish I could rate it a 4.5). Modern razors simply pail in comparison to the closeness achieved with the Merkur. I will further update my review after using the Feather blades.</li>
    <li> This is my first safety razor.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about two months now and I love it. Didn&#x27;t take long to get used to.  After a couple of shaves it is like I&#x27;ve been using a safety razor my whole life.  The shave is as close and lasts as long as any multi-blade disposable out there.  Changing the blades is easy as well.  The razor feels sturdy in my hand.  I have a feeling I&#x27;ll be using it for years to come.  Happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Very well made and great feel. I like the longer handle, it makes me  feel I have more control over the razor.</li>
    <li> This is a top notch product.  I have some rather antique Gillette double edge shavers, one adjustable and one even older. This Merkur is a much better shaver in terms of closeness, kindness to your face, balance and ease of use. Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> I was stuck paying the forty to fifty dollars a month using a cetain brand of 3 blade razor cartriages. I was uneducated in terms of using safety aka &amp;#34;the old style&amp;#34; of razor. After intially using it and failing miserably, I relized there is a learning curve. But now I get the best shave ever. No more razor burn and the redness on my neck is going away. Buying 20 blades for $10 is also an added plus. Definately the way to go and would recommend this razor to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using an electric Panasonic shaver for the past year and it was Gilette Mach 3, Mach 3 Turbo, etc etc before that.  Just poking around on Youtube and various sites I felt that I wanted to try out an \\&quot;old school\\&quot; double edge razor.  I&#x27;m 22 myself, so I&#x27;ve never known anything other than cartridge razors and Edge gel in a can.  I can tell you right now that when my package arrived 45 minutes ago I ripped into it.      First impression of the razor was that it had a really nice heft to it.  It&#x27;s not heavy by any means, but it was nice to have something that felt substantial and that would last me years and years.  It came with one Merkur brand blade in the box, but the literature is in German so I just tossed it.  I also purchased [[ASIN:B001JHEY14 Proraso Shaving Soap, Ultra Sensitive Skin 5.2 oz (147 g)]] and I really like it.  Better than the Col. Conk soaps in my opinion.    After my first shave there was no irritation as I was accustomed to after shaving with Edge gel and Gilette Mach [insert number here].  It takes a tad more time to finish your shave but it is oh so worth it.  Best shave of my life.    If you&#x27;re on the fence about buying this razor, just get it.  I like the length of the handle since I have relatively large hands.  The angle of the blade isn&#x27;t too agressive but it still shaves you nice and close.  Do a little research on techniques for double edge (DE) blade shaving and get a decent quality brush and some soap and prepare to experience the best shaves of your life.</li>
    <li> I had always used a Mach 3 razor.  Instead of the horrible pricing for heads, I switched to this razor.  Hella cheap, will never ever go back to using a shit brand like Mach 3.</li>
    <li> Tried it with some feather blades cuz I heard they were super sharp, along with the art of shaving pre shave, shaving cream n after shave! I had not shaved in about 3 days so I had a little beard going.  I shaved with the grain of hair and then against the grain.  Blade is super sharp that by the time I was done my face was full of nicks n cuts and really irritated.  When I splashed on water on my face, the water made my face sting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suffer from some ingrown hair while shaving w the Gillette fusion, and I thought that this single blade would help , but God I felt like I butchered my face and I was not even pressing on my face.  Not sure what I did wrong since I was shaving super slow and even watched some YouTube videos on how to shave the right way.  Going to give it another try , otherwise I may have to go back to the Gillette fusion since it seems safer and provides a decent and quicker shave.</li>
    <li> I love safety razors!  I think they are retro and cool.  In addition, I do believe they are more environmentally friendly.  Of course they take a little more time to use, but we could all slow down a bit.  That said,  this is a pretty good razor.  I used to use my husband&#x27;s.  He did not like that very much.  My husband&#x27;s is a better razor, but cost twice as much.  I am happy with this.  As said the opening is a little strange.  I might just be used to my husband&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I have a very heavy beard and most razors pull when I shave. I got this after reading a bunch of articles and while it is very easy to use and clean it still pulls when I shave. I do believe this has a lot to do with the blade choice. The razor comes apart easy and is easy to clean. Would recommend as it does give a very nice shave versus your typical razor from the drug store.</li>
    <li> I used 2, 3, 4, 5 and 5+1 blades for 20 years before I realized that all I needed was 1 good blade.  For the price of 1 8-pack of 5+1 blades from that well-known blade/razor manufacturer, you can buy a double-edged razor and 10 blades that will last months.  And then it&#x27;s less than $1 a blade from that point forward (even if you buy the most expensive ones).&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t ever get sick to my stomach when I walk down the shaving aisle again.&lt;br /&gt;I wrote a similar review of the Merkur blades.</li>
    <li> It is good quality.&lt;br /&gt;As advertised.&lt;br /&gt;BUT...it will sit on my shelf  since I cannnot shave well and fast with it.&lt;br /&gt;Sure it is what are fathers used and used for pennies/shaving BUT you need TIME for this.&lt;br /&gt;If you shave 3 x paying carefull attention to the area under the nose (very hard to do it well there) it will do a good job.&lt;br /&gt;I will otherwise shave (2 passes) with 3 blade razor like Gillette Sensor 3 , much faster and with better results.&lt;br /&gt;So, If you use safety razors -this is a good one. But I will go back to &amp;#34;single use&amp;#34; multi blade razors even though there are more expensive.</li>
    <li> Switched to this. I got tired of gillette cost and razor burns. Now im changing blades daily so far no burns (i think multiple razors caused it) and cost alot less to change daily. Happy face, happy pocket, happy wife (now that i shave daily) :)</li>
    <li> The reliability of the Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot say enough about how close it shave and how enjoyable it is to use. The cost of replacement blades are a minuscule fraction of what Gillette and Schick charges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re new to the straight blade, watch the video, learn some technique and buy the product!!!</li>
    <li> I love this razor. My wife asked why I did not buy one cheaper from Target. I told her that I wanted a tool and not a toy. This razor has not disappointed. I don&#x27;t get nicks or razor burn. There is no way to install the blade in such a way to get nicks. I used to use a cheaper brand and had to wear pieces of toilet paper to stop the bleeding every day. Not once has this happened with the Merkur 180. The longer handle makes this tool easier to hold properly and allows me to set the proper angle for the blade. I&#x27;d buy another one but this is so well made that I will probably never need another for the rest of my life.  Save money and get a closer shave without razor burn.</li>
    <li> Bought this because I was looking for a cheaper and better shave than those four and five-bladed monstrosities that go for $5 a blade and last a week. I found it with the Merkur. I&#x27;ve been using it for several months, and I have to say that it was well worth the money, and more. So far I&#x27;ve only tried one type of blade with it, but the razor itself is easy to use, easy to clean, easy to change blades, and feels solid in your hand. It&#x27;s heavy, which is great for this type of shaving, as the weight of the razor is supposed to be all the pressure applied. I have fairly large hands, so I wish the handle were slightly longer, but it&#x27;s not bad. Make sure, when installing a new blade, that you put the middle piece on the correct way. It&#x27;s not difficult to figure out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving with the Merkur, as with any safety razor, takes a little while to get used to. It takes a little longer than shaving with a \\&quot;normal\\&quot; razor, but it&#x27;s worth the time investment. I&#x27;d recommend a good lather brush, and a good shaving soap (both of which I bought right here on Amazon), because using this thing with normal shaving cream is frustrating, and doesn&#x27;t provide as close or as comfortable a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made in a long time, and expect it to last for years and years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update**&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve now been using my Merkur for just over two years, and I am still just as satisfied as I was on day one. It is not as shiny as it was when I bought it, but if I were to polish off the soap residue, I&#x27;m sure it would shine right up. I&#x27;ve settled on the Feather blades, as they seem to be the sharpest I have found. Bought a big lot here on Amazon last year and am not in any danger of running out soon.</li>
    <li> The best better than the original.  I go camping and it is a must..  I was thinking about using no no, but iam glad I waited</li>
    <li> I first shaved with the original Gillette version of this razor 50 years ago.  For the last 40 years, I&#x27;ve been shaving with a cartridge (twin blade) razor.  Over the years, my face has taken its share of abuse, and I finally decided that I should treat myself and my face better. I read all of the reviews here prior to buying, because that&#x27;s what I do nowadays. I noted some reviewers&#x27; \\&quot;dismay\\&quot; at the length of the handle of this razor, but paid that no mind.  Seriously?  The cartridge razor that I have been shaving with for four decades has a longer handle than this.  No matter, it works just fine for me.  This razor has quite a bit of heft to it, so rather than dragging it across my face, I guide it and let its own weight do the work.  I noted as well mentions of nicks.  I&#x27;ve been shaving with the Merkur for a couple of months now--perhaps it is like riding a bike--once you&#x27;ve done it, you do not forget.  No nicks to date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality of the shave.  For me, there are two types of shave; the \\&quot;cosmetic\\&quot; or \\&quot;work day\\&quot; shave vs. the barber quality shave.  The first I call \\&quot;cosmetic\\&quot; because it looks like I&#x27;ve shaved, i.e., I can go to work with it looking good, but if I rub my face, I can feel what others cannot see.  The cosmetic shave is a \\&quot;one pass\\&quot; shave with the grain.  This is a work day shave because I get up early enough in the morning, I&#x27;m not getting up five minutes earlier to have the time for a barber quality shave.  The barber quality shave is a two pass shave; rinse and re-lather after the first pass and shave against the grain the second time around.  This razor excels at both, and the second pass shave, saved for special occasions, is exquisite--incredibly smooth results.  This is the shave that I want when that special woman&#x27;s fingers or lips caress my cheek.  The Merkur more than delivers, I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people are concerned with the dangers of handling blade changes.  All I can say to that is if you have a problemwith changing the blades in this razor, you should stay out of the kitchen . . . or grow up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maintenance.  Always take care of your tools.  I rinse thoroughly and then wipe the razor (not the blade) completely after use.  This keeps it nice and shiny and prevents soap residue buildup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other tools required. A great shave requires more than just a really good razor; if you are using soap from a can, you&#x27;re only halfway there with the razor. High quality shaving soap or cream and a shave brush are prerequisites. The latter should be badger bristle only. Good badger shave brushes can be found on Amazon at reasonable prices. Note that it is common to lose a bristle or two on occasion. If you are losing more than that every time you use the brush, then you have a defective brush. This can happen even with highly respected brands, but it doesn&#x27;t happen that often. My first two brushes lasted 20 years each, my third, only six months (my fourth has had no issues).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finish up with an essential oils (no alcohol) shave balm. It&#x27;s expensive, but only two drops are required per shave. This makes my face feel and smell great without the latter being noticeable to anyone who isn&#x27;t in my embrace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:  Great razor for experienced users, does an excellent job when used properly.  Inexperienced users might want to use some caution until shaving with the Merkur becomes second nature.  Shave properly and you will not only experience the best of shaves with the Mekur, but will actually look forward to shaving as something pleasurable rather than an annoying chore.</li>
    <li> The handle on this razor resembles the length of the typical disposable and M3s out there which made the transition nice for me.  Very simplistic and easy to use.  Not much more to say about it other than it works for what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
    <li> Incredible German quality. It&#x27;s one of the best razors that you can buy for this price @ only $30 and It was my first razor that I bought after shaving with the Hydro 5. If you have the cash, buy a Feather for $180. I use Derby Extra blades and they work well for me. Also Astra Platinum are nice blades, but it varies for everyone. I got this razor with the Van Der Hagen Men&#x27;s Luxury Shaving Set ($30) since I was going to buy a brush anyway, and you get everything you need besides the razor and blades for a mere $30. You will save lots of $$$ in the long run even if you spent a ton in the beginning on an expensive set. This razor and that set is very nice for a beginner.</li>
    <li> I got this for my brother who has a heavy beard. ( see review or persona blades) and it is a great handle. I don&#x27;t know what more to say since I don&#x27;t personally use this product. But my brother is loving it. That&#x27;s enough for me.</li>
    <li> this was a gift for my oldest son and he just loves it. and is happy not to have to spend big money on blades now.</li>
    <li> really feels good to shave and not be so wasteful, no nicks yet either. Easy to shave once you let the razor do the work and try not to force it.</li>
    <li> In spite of the good comments, I could not get a decent shave. I even tried shaving twice and when I was done, it felt almost like a day old beard. Maybe it was the blade that came with it but it was not at all like others described it.</li>
    <li> Went from a Gillette 5 blade to this safety razor.  I no longer get razor burns or ingrown hairs.  It is a much more enjoyable shave now.</li>
    <li> This razor has worked very well for me.  I wish the handle had about another inch on it, but it is well balanced and easy to change blades so I couldn&#x27;t take off any stars.</li>
    <li> Wish I would have bought one of these a long time ago. By far the best razor I have ever used. I don&#x27;t get razor burn form this type of razor like I do when I use those awful  multi blade razors and is way cheaper.</li>
    <li> This is best razor ever. It is heavy and not flimsy. It gives you a really close shave without any irritation.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality,  smooth comfortable shave.  Couldn&#x27;t ask for anything more.</li>
    <li> I got it for my husband who constantly gets irritation and razor burns shaving with his Gillette MACH3 razor.He prefers Feather blades to the one that came with this razor and he finds that changing them every other shaving is necessary for him.He finds a long handle handy  and says that this razor has a good weight so you don&#x27;t have to put any pressure on it. If you are new to shaving with double edge razor it would be a good Idea to watch few tutorial videos first.</li>
    <li> I like it. It reminds me of my father&#x27;s old one, but I cannot remember his brand. A shorter handle for his razor. I used it awhile, but tend to nick myself. So I tossed it away long ago. Wished I kept it.. But I was too young and too into Gilette multi-blades shaving back then. Ordered the Merkur-Razor Double Edge Razor Blades, works well. Still trying to hone my skills as I have not use it in a long while, but the shave was clean even without using shaving cream. Will recommend to go the whole routine of warm water, shaving cream et al. I am shaving without shaving cream now to recall how to shave with a single blade again before I go the whole hog. Like the feel of a good shave. Recommended for those who want a good clean shave on the cheap.</li>
    <li> This simple safety razor gives me the best shave of my lifetime.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the quality of this razor.  I get a better shave with less irritation than I got with the four blade cartridge razor that I used to shave with.  I use this razor with Merkur double edged blades and the full line of Proraso shaving products for the best shave ever!</li>
    <li> He loves it. It really fit all the good reviews. It offers a closer shave than the five blade manual razors. The razor refills are cheaper, like 10 cents a piece. I think i am going to buy one for myself. The only reason I did not give it five stars it I have nothing to compare it too.</li>
    <li> I gave up 40+ years of using multi-blade cartridge razors and bought a butterfly-top Parker last summer; I liked using a safety razor, and loved the thrift of safety blades ... but was drawing blood way too often. I decided to try the Merkur 180 before abandoning the safety razor altogether -- and it instantly became my weapon of choice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Merkur is lighter than the Parker, just as easy to clean [NOTE to novices: Disassemble and rinse the razor and blade thoroughly after EVERY use!], and much smoother to use -- I&#x27;ve only drawn blood once, and that was due to momentary distraction. German engineering proves out once again, and a little higher purchase price is far outweighed by the Merkur&#x27;s performance. I would recommend this razor without hesitation!</li>
    <li> I am brand new to straight edge shaving so this razor was the right price for me to give it a shot. The blade that the razor comes with is very nice. If you take your time and let the razor do the shaving (don&#x27;t press it down against your face) you&#x27;ll be amazed with the results. I had one insignificant knick while shaving and that was it on my first time. I&#x27;ve been using the razor about two weeks now to trim my neck now and again to maintain a small beard and still haven&#x27;t replaced blades!! I also bought the 100 Astra Superior Premium Platinum Double Edge Safety Razor Blades but have yet to even open them. If you want to save some money in the long run shaving, switch to this method of shaving today. Even for manscaping, as long as you take your time, you get a better shave with fewer (almost zero) ingrown hairs and much more comfortable feeling after you&#x27;re done. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I understand that in order to accommodate the blade, the head needs to be wide,but I just can&#x27;t get used to how much wider this is than one of the disposable (expensive) cartridge heads.  It&#x27;s nearly impossible for me to shave under my nose.  Also, the thing weighs a lot!</li>
    <li> With no razor burns! Back to basics for me! I am truly pleased with this buy! I believe everyone will enjoy shaving with this easy single blade razor.</li>
    <li> This is my first DE razor, so I can&#x27;t compare it to others, but I have been satisfied with the product. I like the weight of the razor and it is comfortable in my hand. It is solidly built and could not be simpler. It is very easy to remove the head and replace the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When considering a DE razor I was a little hesitant and scared I would slice my face open, but I have found it to be easy to use with very little practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find myself holding the handle close to the head and would probably appreciate the short handle model, but I have been satisfied with the product. The handle is approximately 3 3/4 inches long (about an inch shorter than a Gillette Fusion handle). Probably more of an issue of preference than anything.</li>
    <li> My bf loves his new razor!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very new to DE shaving, and this razor has helped ease me into it. It is solid and well-balanced, providing a great shave. Its weight helps you work on your technique and not put pressure on your face. I was able to find the right angle quickly and get a great shave. I see no reason to look for another. I&#x27;ve been using Feather blades which, while very sharp, provide an excellent shave.</li>
    <li> This razor tears my husband&#x27;s face up.</li>
    <li> so far so good.  Haven&#x27;t sliced myself open yet and works very well.  Went for this once, as it was called a starter razor - I agree.  Start here.  Comes with one blade, buy more and use a high quality shaving lotion.</li>
    <li> This is amazing, it&#x27;s one blade cut smoothly through my beard. I always get a nick or some abrasion using the mach 3, but not with this.  The blades are a really good price as well, the mach 3 and all the popular brands of 3 blades or four, whatever, are all ripoffs, I&#x27;ll never go back.</li>
    <li> First safety razor and have had it 2 years now it is phenomenal. No problems well built,fits perfect in my hand and is easy to use and learn with.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m the average joe person who was scared of changing from typical razor to this single blade Merkur Razor but I went through with this and gave it a shot and won&#x27;t go back to the regular razor because&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-cheaper blades&lt;br /&gt;-cleaner shave/closer to the face&lt;br /&gt;-smooth shave&lt;br /&gt;-not difficult to use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your an average joe whos scared dont be scared give it a shot, 90% of you will enjoy it.</li>
    <li> I have had this for about a month and love it! I really don&#x27;t understand why more people don&#x27;t go &#x27;back&#x27; to the double edge - it definately cuts as well or even better than the various double, triple and quadruple blades out there. I love the feel of it as well and it looks classy and impressive.</li>
    <li> Hands down the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had. I&#x27;ve been using 3 and 4 blade razors for years-- schick, gilette, tried several different kinds. I&#x27;ve tried the blades that have the cooling aloe strip, nothing stopped me from getting terrible razor burn within 1-4 hours after shaving and it would last for several days before subsiding. Shaving two days in a row was not possible for me, because there would be so much irritation that shaving again would just make it 10x worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this razor at least 5 times now. I shaved three days in a row for the first time since my teens (I&#x27;m in my 30s). Again, best shave I&#x27;ve ever had. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Love this thing and that&#x27;s that, others have said plenty of praise so I won&#x27;t repeat it, except I love that after about 6 mnts use it looks brand new after just a quick wipe with a towel.&lt;br /&gt;Where my take is a little different from what I read before I started using this and it was making me a bit concerned,&lt;br /&gt;is the safety of it but I found this razor to be very forgiving actually.&lt;br /&gt;I often forget to take slow and deliberate strokes and start speeding through the shave,&lt;br /&gt;and that results in sometimes pulling the razor accidentally sideways across my cheek.&lt;br /&gt;Not once did I have a nasty cut which happened to me in the past with some old razors I used prior to Merkur,&lt;br /&gt;resulting in a pretty bad cut as shave cuts go.&lt;br /&gt;Which to me speaks how far these folks went into designing very efficient yet safe device.&lt;br /&gt;While trying different blades I found that some will leave my face irritated and bloody but not from cuts, some blades pull my skin for some reason while others leave my face baby smooth with no irritation what so ever.&lt;br /&gt;The one that suits me best so far is Shark.&lt;br /&gt;I have pretty thick and strong facial hair and I go once along the hair growth and once against, lathering in between and with this razor/blade combo, results make me look forward to my next shave.  Where before people knew me as scruffy now I almost never go past 2 days without a shave and with the above mentioned way of shaving my face is smoother the 2nd day vs fresh shave with electric I switched from.&lt;br /&gt;Where were you Merkur 180, 10 yrs ago when my old trusty razor I inherited from my dad finally gave in and I went on the path disposables and electrics?</li>
    <li> This is my first safety razor, and unlike others, I don&#x27;t think I will be collecting a variety of different ones.  This one gets the job done!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Switched to SR because I have a job now where I have to shave daily, I could always get away with every other day or third day  before.  I was getting horrible razor burn from the multi blad monstrosities so I thought I would give an SR a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is fantastic and I don&#x27;t think I need to buy any other.  It has a great heft and feels like you are using a tool when you shave!  It starts the day off right when you can feel like a man first thing in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since buying this razor I have been telling everyone I know how great it is to sahve with one.  I have enev told my wife to try it on her legs, since many of the reviews are by women, why not!</li>
    <li> This razor was purchased as a gift for a family-member who lusted after my personal razor of the same make.  I love mine.  He loves his. And he&#x27;s now 10 times more of a man for using it.</li>
    <li> Loved it.  First one was a gift to my husband and second one as a Christmas gift for my brother.  Both loved it!!!!</li>
    <li> Wow,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am never going back to a traditional razor. I once used Mach 3 and abandoned that for Schick Excel. Now I&#x27;m going from a two-blade razor to a single blade and what a difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why do we really need more than one good blade? I do admit that I was at first scared while shaving, knowing there was an insanely sharp razor exposed enough to strip some skin. But I have only given myself the minor nicks, and way less nicks than when I had my Schick. I used to always get razor burn on the right side of my neck, but now no razor burn whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor is amazing, and the replacement blades are insanely cheap. My only warning is that I did end up buying one for my Dad, and he supposedly gave himself a nasty cut while shaving quickly/recklessly. I don&#x27;t know how he did it, since I&#x27;m not exactly careful with the blade any more and have not had an issue, but you&#x27;ve been warned.</li>
    <li> My husband had been bugging me for a safety razor for months, but he still had old cartridges to go through and I wasn&#x27;t going to waste those.  This was one of the first I spotted and he loves it.  The color is beautiful, it has a hefty weight in the hand and he claims the shave is amazing(I see no difference, but he&#x27;s happy, so...).  I do recommend buying a different brand of blade, such as the Feather, as they seem to be better than the Merkur blade that came with it.  We will be trying other blades though, so it could just be the one they sent us.</li>
    <li> Great weight, my first DE razor. Very happy with it 2 months in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again if broke, however getting into the shaving culture now means I want to try out more and more! So I would probably try a different one; however, that&#x27;s nothing to do with this razor in particular.</li>
    <li> THIS IS MY FIRST LEGIT RAZOR IT IS EVERYTHING THAT I ASKED FOR. PRICE IS REASONABLE  I CHANGE THE BLADE EVERY WEEK ID SUGGEST A STAND TO KEEP IT CLEAN THO</li>
    <li> Love this razor.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s meant for beginners or not, but it does a great job.  I always get a clean shave and it&#x27;s very easy to take apart, to clean and dry the blade assembly.  I only nicked myself a couple of times the first time I shaved (don&#x27;t worry, you don&#x27;t even really feel it when it happens), and since then I haven&#x27;t bled even once.</li>
    <li> Precision made. I like it a lot, even more than the multi - blade disposables I have used for years. Thought it would take getting used to, but it felt natural the first time out.</li>
    <li> The best razor I bought ever</li>
    <li> As the gateway drug into wet shaving. Many I bet enjoy this razor. If your looking into wet shaving. Do your face a favor and start with this one. And don&#x27;t get a butterfly stye one. This 3 piece razor will keep the blade angle consistent. Enjoy shaving!</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT FOR SHAVE CONTROL</li>
    <li> I purchased this item on December 28, 2012.  Since then, I have used it a few times a week.  It replaced a Gillette Fusion razor, after an extensive amount of research into shaving and ingrown hairs.  My neck used to be irritated from shaving all the time.  I had shaving bumps that would never go away.  Eventually, I learned that the culprit was the razor I was using.  Modern, multiple blade razors actually cut the hair below the skin, which causes razor bumps, irritation, and ingrown hairs.  A single blade razor is not only best for the skin, but lends an art to shaving.  When paired with a quality brush and shave soap, this razor is unstoppable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the (nearly) three years that I have owned this razor, not only does my skin feel better than it ever has, but so does my wallet.  I decided to stop shelling out for cartridges, and start shaving with a timeless method that won’t break the bank.  This razor, as well as replacement blades, are affordable and well worth the money.  I prefer the longer handle as opposed to the shorter length of the early to mid-century Gillette razors; I find that it gives more control and a better grip. Combined with the knurling on the majority of the handle, even when wet this razor would be hard to drop.  The simplicity of the three piece design makes blade changes easy, but also lends itself to keeping the razor clean.  A butterfly style razor has a lot of nooks and crannies that can easily get gunked up, with this razor you have only three pieces that can all be completely cleaned.  I like that the handle is hollow and open on each end.  This helps not only with a precise weight balance, but also lends itself to the above mentioned cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plating has proven to be durable and has held up wonderfully over the course of my experience.  There is hardly a scratch, let alone any flaking.  The plating covers the entire razor; there are no blemishes or spots.  There is a small, precision etched Merkur logo on the bottom of the handle, just before the larger knurled end.  I appreciate small details and aesthetics like this.  It is another detail that speaks to the quality of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although there are many razors that are more expensive and have adjustable blade angles, in my opinion this is more of a gimmick than anything else.  It is not necessary to have a large degree of adjustability to set the blade angle; this will not help you attain a better shave.  In fact, it’ll probably help you to cut yourself easier and become disgruntled with wet shaving.  Wet shaving is about hair reduction, and with each individual pass you will reduce the hair, rather than cut it below the skin in one shot like you would with a cartridge razor.  I find that the blade angle on this Merkur is set perfectly, and I have tried many razors, both vintage and new alike.  This is the one I always come back to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Durable&lt;br /&gt;- Strong&lt;br /&gt;- High-quality&lt;br /&gt;- Precision weight&lt;br /&gt;- Three-piece design&lt;br /&gt;- Easily cleaned&lt;br /&gt;- Long-lasting plating&lt;br /&gt;- Blade angle is perfectly set&lt;br /&gt;- Etched logo&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- I usually try to include something that could be improved upon in my reviews, but in this case, I have no cons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, this is an excellent choice for an affordable, quality double edge razor.  It is great for novices and pros alike.  With proper care, there should be no reason for this razor not to last a lifetime.  I hope to pass mine down to a family member one day.  I rate this product 5/5 stars, I would definitely purchase another if mine were lost or stolen.  I recommend this for anyone looking to start wet shaving, or even for those who already know how and just need a new razor.

    <li> I&#x27;m new to the world of manly man shaving, but I&#x27;m pretty excited about it. I&#x27;ve had some the closest shaves so far from this and razor burn is fading out of my personal lexicon.  I&#x27;m still getting used to the smooth touch required for an old school blade and have cut myself a few times.  I was using disposables for way too long.  I am glad I got the long handle though because the long handle is about as long as a regular disposable handle.  I did do a lot of research and Merkur has the best name around.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo14AYT0MEXPC8G]]UPDATED 8/15/2015&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you&#x27;re here, it&#x27;s either because (1) you&#x27;re one of the old schoolers who recognized the brand and was looking for another razor like the one you had back when shaving was an art form, or (2) you&#x27;re a young buck who has done studying and have heard the recent hype: That straight razors and safety razors are making a comeback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t speak to the 1st audience, because I wasn&#x27;t born when  Merkur was made popular.  I can, however, speak to the 2nd audience, as I somewhat fit into that category.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First some history.  I&#x27;d been a Gillette man for the longest time.  I had the old Mach 2 Turbo, then the Mach 3, then the M3 Power, then the Fusion.  Yes, I&#x27;ve wasted a lot of money, between the handles and the replacement razors.  I&#x27;d estimate it to be in the $1,000 range.  Well, as you can probably understand, I didn&#x27;t want to spend that money on razors anymore, plus I&#x27;d read stories that the straight and safety razors of old  times are supposed to be better for your shaving area than the newer razors with multiple blades and lube strips, mostly due to the frequency of razor burn.  So I decide to pick one of these up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just so you know, I use (and recommend) various shaving products, listed as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- [[ASIN:B00PHH8OZY Somersets Extra Sensitive Shaving Oil, 15ml Bottles (2 Pack)]] - I use this now, quality pre-shave.  Not only travel friendly, but works excellently enough that you will feel zero drag from shaving no matter how dull your blade is.  In fact it works so well you could shave with this and water and be good enough.  Has a light menthol effect but not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;- [[ASIN:B001PDC3LU John Allan&#x27;s Slick Water Lotion, 2 Ounce]] - Very nice pre-shave, excellent cooling effect and minimizes drag wonderfully.  The problem with this stuff is that (A) it&#x27;s way overpriced and (B) it gets clumpy and messy over time.&lt;br /&gt;-  [[ASIN:B00GPYH4EK No7 Men Calming Post Shave Recovery Balm - 1.76 oz (50ml)]] - I use this now, quality after shave.  Gives that &amp;quot;baby&#x27;s bottom smooth&amp;quot; feeling, helps close pores and ease irritation.&lt;br /&gt;- [[ASIN:B000NPJHQU Bump Patrol Original Formula After Shave Intensive Treatment, 4 Ounce]] - I use this now.  About an hour or so before shaving (or the night before), apply to washed face.  Shower with a face scrub, then shave, then re-apply.  Existing bumps start to disappear within 24 hours and prevents future outbreak so long as you repeat these steps.&lt;br /&gt;- [[ASIN:B00H6WIP5M Every Man Jack - Every Man Jack Face Scrub Fragrance Free, 5 oz cream]] - I use this now.  Works wonders for facial cleansing and exfoliation before shaving.  Also helps to &amp;quot;numb&amp;quot; the shaving area which eases blade glide.&lt;br /&gt;- [[ASIN:B001A3FLF0 Van Der Hagen Select Shave Soap, 2.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)]] - I use this now.  Great value for the price, solid soap, lathers thick, but you have to have the right ratio of soap to water, so it&#x27;s not too runny.&lt;br /&gt;- [[ASIN:B001Q7QABO Col. Conk World&#x27;s Famous Shaving Soap, Almond * 3 - Pack * Each Net Weight 2.25 Oz]] - Great smell, applies smooth, but doesn&#x27;t lather quite as thick as I prefer.  Also I found it had basically tarnished the inside of the soap cup over time.  Not a big deal, just something to consider.&lt;br /&gt;- [[ASIN:B0017ZECA6 100 7a.m. Platinum Double Edge Safety Razor Blades]] - Excellent value, they don&#x27;t last long...the idea is to buy so many that it doesn&#x27;t matter if they don&#x27;t last that long.  I can get between 1 and 2 weeks use out of a single blade; so you figure between 1 and 3 years without having to buy more.  Note - these blades are &amp;quot;GOOD ENOUGH&amp;quot; if you prep your face properly, per the instructions listed, and they will last you so long before needing to buy more, you really shouldn&#x27;t care anyway.&lt;br /&gt;- [[ASIN:B0010Y1KYA Shaving Gift Set with Merkur Safety Razor, Bowl, Shaving Soap, Badger Brush, Stand and Safety Razor, Great Fathers Day Gift]] - Bought for myself, the brush is good, and I gave away the small razor that came with it.  It&#x27;s not the top of the line but it&#x27;ll do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed about this little ditty is that it&#x27;s easy to clean.  If you&#x27;re like me and you shave using a running faucet of warm/hot water, you&#x27;ll be right at home and pleasantly surprised at how easy it is to clean.  One thing to watch out for - because it&#x27;s all metal, it holds in the heat VERY WELL - so you&#x27;ll not want to use full heat or I guarantee you&#x27;ll burn yourself something fierce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second thing I noticed, and quite notable, is how easy it is to replace the actual blade.  Just unscrew the handle, lift off the bottom, replace the blade, replace and screw back on.  Never easier.  Speaking of the blade, the instructions don&#x27;t tell you how frequently to replace the blade, but online some people state to replace it once a week.  That seems a bit frequent to me if you&#x27;re just doing maintenance shaves once a day.  Some with rougher beards I can understand, but mine is not nearly that bad - and mostly maintenance from previous shaves.  I would say - change it when it feels like it&#x27;s starting to snag easier than you&#x27;re thinking it should.  The biggest things to keep in mind: lather, lather, lather, and keep the blade wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw a few people were cutting themselves with this razor.  I haven&#x27;t cut myself and I&#x27;ve used it quite a bit.  The two main causes of cutting oneself are incorrect angling and too much pressure.  Because this is a razor with no plastic guides to protect you, it means you have to go slower, be more careful, and master the art of shaving the way it was originally intended.  Not for nothing though - you just need to practice control.  Also, you can&#x27;t hold this razor like the older ones, you really need to hold it with graceful fingers; the lighter you hold it the less tempted you&#x27;ll be to press down when you&#x27;re shaving.  The angle also matters - it shouldn&#x27;t be held like a squeegee, it should be held at roughly a 30 degree angle.  The combination will effectively leave it up to the blade to do the cutting, not your strength (or lack thereof).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice that this blade can get insanely close.  In fact, just to test, I shaved with my old Fusion razor and felt my face; I could feel follicles, but then I shaved right after with the Merkur, and it actually got hair that the Fusion didn&#x27;t.  Additionally, I had some razor bumps on my neckline, not too large, but still visible, no matter how frequently I shaved.  Since shaving with the Merkur, some of these have disappeared entirely.  I also follow up my shave with an all-over astringent due to oil issues, and normally it&#x27;s a crazy burn after shaving, but after shaving with the Merkur there&#x27;s no burn whatsoever.  Definitely a positive change from what I used to experience, trust me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some added information: you want to make sure your face is clean before shaving.  I say that because the oils and dirt on your face can contribute to razor bumps and poor shaving quality.  The cleaner the better.  In my case I use some shower cleaners that work extremely well, but just make sure your face is clean with whatever you choose to use.  Also, to improve the quality of the shave, I apply a bit of baby oil to my still-wet face, then the shaving soap lather on top of that.  Helps the blade move smoother across the skin and makes it feel baby smooth.  Some other items are body oil (Vaseline has two good ones, cocoa butter and aloe vera) and and certain pre-shave oils.  Everyone&#x27;s physiology is different though; do whatever is comfortable for you.  I&#x27;m just adding this here for ideas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, if you&#x27;re tired of paying $20-$30 for blades that claim to last a month yet last a week or two...if you&#x27;re wanting a closer, more comfortable shave with little-to-no razor burn...if you want to experience what the old schoolers have been talking about, definitely try a Merkur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to throw in a bit here as I see more and more reviews from people who just don&#x27;t get it.  Merkur is all about the quality of the shave, not the speed.  I don&#x27;t know how many times people need to express that, but if you do your research you will find numerous people saying the same thing - this razor is NOT for those who just want to speed through their shave!  You need to take your time and not rush through it.  You WILL cut yourself if you rush with this razor.  You WILL NOT get a quality shave if you don&#x27;t take your time.  You WILL wear down the blade if you dry shave, and this blade WILL NOT protect you.  If you&#x27;re going to use this razor, take the proper precautions.  If you know you&#x27;re a speed demon shaver, DON&#x27;T BUY THIS, because I really don&#x27;t want to see you up on here complaining that you have to take your time.The angle also matters - it shouldn&#x27;t be held like a squeegee, it should be held at roughly a 30 degree angle.  The combination will effectively leave it up to the blade to do the cutting, not your strength (or lack thereof).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice that this blade can get insanely close.  In fact, just to test, I shaved with my old Fusion razor and felt my face; I could feel follicles, but then I shaved right after with the Merkur, and it actually got hair that the Fusion didn&#x27;t.  Additionally, I had some razor bumps on my neckline, not too large, but still visible, no matter how frequently I shaved.  Since shaving with the Merkur, some of these have disappeared entirely.  I also follow up my shave with an all-over astringent due to oil issues, and normally it&#x27;s a crazy burn after shaving, but after shaving with the Merkur there&#x27;s no burn whatsoever.  Definitely a positive change from what I used to experience, trust me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some added information: you want to make sure your face is clean before shaving.

    <li> This razor will give you an extremely close shave! Unlike the plastic Gillette fusion razors this razor is heavy, so you don&#x27;t have to apply any pressure. Just hold it by the end and let it glide. You don&#x27;t want to shave against the grain at first (if that&#x27;s what you did right off the bat with the old plastic razors), shaving with the grain and 90 degrees to it will give a nice smooth shave. Also, when I used to lather for the second time, the old plastic razor would really irritate my skin the second time. With this type of razor though there&#x27;s no irritation, so you can lather, and relather  multiple times. Just remember to not apply too much pressure. The blades are also very cheap so you can change them frequently.</li>
    <li> I just got this item today and promptly tried it out. Best shave I&#x27;ve ever had! The blade it comes with is crazy sharp, but I managed to not cut myself. Getting used to using it will take some work. But even though I&#x27;ve used nothing but disposables and electrics, I was still able to get a nice shave on the first try. Goodbye Gillette and all the disposables!! I&#x27;ll probably keep my Wahl though. I can use it to touch up while I get used to using the Merkur.</li>
    <li> I like this.  It has a classic look, it&#x27;s a decent shave, I&#x27;ll have it for years - no more throwing away cartriges (those things are getting too expensive these days) and it&#x27;s not too expensive.  At first I was nervous and bought a stiptic pencil to go with - all the other reviews said to go easy or you&#x27;ll peel your face off.  But that didn&#x27;t happen.  When I went easy, it barely worked.  I still recommend that folks treat it with respect, but don&#x27;t be afraid of it.  I have to press mine down and find just the right angle.  But once that&#x27;s there it shaves as close if not closer than the most popular blade on the market - the Mach 3.  I used one on each side of my face once I got the hang of the Merkur and the Merkur was a closer shave.  I&#x27;m letting my face have a transition period because every time I change brands or types of blade I get razor burn for the first week and alternating for a couple weeks keeps that from happening.  So in about three days I&#x27;ll be over to the Merkur full time.  Plus I spent $30 on cartriges for the Mack 3 and don&#x27;t want those going to waste.        And get some of the Colonel Conk shaving products to go with it.  It&#x27;s the best deal around.[[ASIN:B000MXGMHU Col.

    <li> Great shaver folks! I have actually quite a few shavers for my face, and this is really one of the best. It was, in fact, one of the first DE razors that I purchased. I think that for an overall clean shave, no razor burn, or cuts, this will work for most anyone! The consideration is obviously the preparation of the surface of the face. I really must prepare my hairs well, before I shave. My face can really be a nighmare for any razor, if I don&#x27;t get those hairs soft, regardless of the razor I am using at the time. Warm towel, sometimes an oil, brushing the hairs with a badger brush and soap (my preference over creams), letting the lather sit for a while, even putting another warm towel over my facial hairs after the first lathering and before the first \\&quot;with the grain\\&quot; shaving. Experiment with a few different types of razor blades as well. Some work well with one razor, but apparently do not work well with another one, for whatever reason...But regardless, the 180 works very nicely for me....very nicely. Take care and best of shaving.....it is strange that this is such a new interest for me, after already shaving for almost 40 years.</li>
    <li> As someone with EXTREMELY sensitive skin, particularly on my thighs and underarms, I have struggled for years to find a hair removal solution that doesn&#x27;t leave me with nasty razor bumps and ingrown hairs. After trying it all -- from Nair to wax to epilation, single-bladed, five-bladed, and everything in between -- this is THE ONLY WAY for me to get a smooth shave without any irritation. Yes, it does take a bit more care to master. But, it is also easier to clean between strokes and the savings are ridiculous. I bought a pack of 100 blades for $10. That&#x27;s the price of FOUR Venus cartridges. This is definitely the best way to go, men and women included.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been working my way up from an electric razor 20 years ago to this, and it&#x27;s been getting better all the time.  I used to use the Gillette 3-blade disposables, and that was okay.  Relatively smooth, and the wife was happy.      Now, having switched to the Merkur #180, I&#x27;m never going back to any cartridge - evah. Too expensive, too many ingrown hairs, and now I know my shave wasn&#x27;t nearly as close as it could have been.    I tried the #180 last week with some Derby blades, and the first couple times were not too great.  I was very delicate with how I held the handle, didn&#x27;t apply pressure during strokes, etc.  Now I&#x27;m a bit more confident, I bought a good badger-hair brush and some decent soap, and things have gotten much better.     My face is smoother than ever, it&#x27;s easier to shave in the morning due to less overnight growth, and the wife is even happier.  Smoove, baby.    Here are a few tips I&#x27;d recommend if you&#x27;re starting to use a DE razor:    1.  Exfoliate just before shaving - I use St. Ives with pulverized walnut shells.  When I don&#x27;t exfoliate first, the shave isn&#x27;t as close.    2.  Shave in the shower.  It&#x27;s more difficult to master, but a good mirror is invaluable until you get the hang of it.  Shower shaving is great because the steam softens your beard, the razor is easier to clean, and when you&#x27;re done there&#x27;s no residue behind ears, etc.    3.  Alcohol-based after shave is for chumps.  Get a good after shave that moisturizes.  Amazon has tons of them for sale - check the reviews.  I like the products by Geo F. Trumper.      4.  Don&#x27;t be afraid to pursue the closest shave possible.  Having a babybutt-smooth face doesn&#x27;t make you a metrosexual - it&#x27;s evidence of a real man who knows how to take care of himself.  If you also have a spray-on tan, well then it&#x27;s time for some introspection.    Most broads like a smooth face.  Enjoy.</li>
    <li> Sure it shaves close, very close.  It&#x27;s a razor blade, handle with care.  If you&#x27;re not completely awake, coherent, and patient don&#x27;t use this razor.  It will remove skin from your face.  All razors will nick you, this type of razor will scar you.  I bought this razor hoping to save money on replacement blades, it&#x27;s certainly cheaper in the long run.  However, it&#x27;s not worth the savings if you constantly scar your face.  The cheapest disposable won&#x27;t cut you like this razor will.  If you have lots of time and are extremely careful then this razor will be fine for you.  If you&#x27;re like me and want shaving to be quick and painless, then get a different razor.</li>
    <li> This is a well crafted tool that you can tell will last a long time.  I&#x27;ve bashed it pretty hard on my faucet several times accidentally, with nary a scratch.  Actually I&#x27;ve been more worried about my faucet.  Several critiques; First, I wish it were longer.  Even though this is the long handled razor, it&#x27;s still not as long as my old Mach 3.  In practice though, with medium size hands, it&#x27;s a non-issue and really just takes some getting used to.  Second, the steel handle is of decent gauge, but hollow on the inside.  Part of my wishes it were a little heftier, but you can still tell that it will last forever.  The handle has a nice textured grip as well.  As far as shaves go, I get a closer shave with less irritation, as compared to my Mach 3.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Works well and has a very grippy handle. I would prefer more weight like the Edwin Jagger but this gets the job done as well.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband as a Christmas present. He had never used this style of razor before and was a bit nervous about using it at first. I did a lot of research because he gets really bad in grown hairs and razor burn from shaving. This razor mixed with some Men&#x27;s Science shaving gel seemed to help a lot! This razor was very high quality and sturdy. Great value for this style of razor!</li>
    <li> Replacement for another blade I bought. I like this blade.</li>
    <li> Awesome razor! I&#x27;ve saved so much money not having to buy those replacement cartridges. If you have sensitive skin like I do learn to use the rounded top to pull the razor away from your skin.</li>
    <li> Sometimes I&#x27;m not so sure if I&#x27;m actually even cutting hair with this thing but that&#x27;s due to the odd top on it I believe, the guard. I&#x27;m having a hard time finding that perfect angle to cut but whenever I do it&#x27;s pretty nice.</li>
    <li> I have been on the lookout to try something different when it came to shaving, so I decide to give this razor a try after reading the reviews and boy I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. It had to be one of the closest shaves I&#x27;ve had outside of going to the barber. Best part is with the 100 replacement blades I brought for six bucks, I won&#x27;t have to buy any for at least the next 10 years, saving me a fortune in those expensive cartridge ones. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I purchased this back in April 2012 and I&#x27;ve been using it since. It was my very first time using a safety razor. Since then, I purchased two more safety razors but I ended up coming back to this one. After my research, I got the impression this was a good starter safety razor for a beginner. However, after using two other safety razors I think this will be perfectly fine for me. I did and still do one day want to venture into the straight razor arena. I can now shave with this razor as quick as I used to with a Mach 3. The weight, feel, and length are perfect for me. My other razors are slightly shorter. It&#x27;s hard to go wrong with this one.</li>
    <li> Been using one of those chargeable electric razers. Never going back. A good old fashioned shave really is the best. Take the extra 4 or 5 minutes and treat yourself to a quality shave.</li>
    <li> my Husband loves this razor.  he has been wanting one for some time now so we bought it with a bunch of different blades.  The blades fir great and the razor is easy to handle.  So far, so good!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve switched from using twin blade disposables to this. I decided to do that as a result of making investments in my infrastructure and I&#x27;m happy with this one. The weight is nice and the tactile feel of the razor doesn&#x27;t disappoint. I&#x27;ve used it for just over a month now and would recommend it to anyone looking to do what I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Merkur long handle for a week and I&#x27;m happy with the performance so far.  I was a little concerned with some of the issues guys were having with the threaded stud that screws into the handle that holds the blade and guard into place.  The only root cause I can come up with is over torquing.  A little dab will do ya - just snug it up guys!</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor because I was trying to safe money from buying disposables. Great product and easy care. Would purchase again if needed.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor based on the reviews and what a difference!!&lt;br /&gt;It puts my old razor to shame and im very happy with not only getting a better shave.&lt;br /&gt;But saving all the money i was spending on replacement blades.</li>
    <li> Love this sexy beast of a razor. If you are looking for a chromed out sickness hair busting machine.... look no further! This bad boy bust beards making the shabbiest of dudes looking dapper and smooth. Get yourself a nice pack of razors and shaving lather you will then be set for success. If you desire multiple woman rubbing your soft cheeks, and young boys looking up to you in jealousy because they cannot yet produce manly facial hair.... look no further. It will not only change your life, it will bring you please...... long handled chromoly pleasure. Don&#x27;t think, just push the buy button. You will never look back.</li>
    <li> The last time I used safety razors was 30 years ago…I decided to go back, after spending 6 months,  trying every razor in the market… Unfortunately, NOT A SINGLE RAZOR produced a close smooth shave.. Even when I used new blades and 3-4 passes…my skin felt like a sandpaper..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Razor companies, it seems, perfected a brilliant business model: increase the number of blades (to max the price)…while blunting the blades (to minimize the number of shaves)… And just to make sure users join this &amp;#34;progress&amp;#34;, they phase out popular 2/3-blades razors (e.g., try to get authentic Atra handle)….This &amp;#34;blunt-multi-blade&amp;#34; strategy already produced the fashionable &amp;#34;4 days beard&amp;#34; look… Users wishing to get a closer shave, beyond the sandpaper stage, must press the blunt blades against their skin and break the plastics… ending up using 2 multi-blades razors for every shave…. the razor company doubles its revenues….&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the safety razor as the last resort, when all attempts to liberate my face from the sandpaper-feel,  failed...I also bought a box of 100 blades from Astra…(about $0.1 per blade)..I was a bit hesitant, recalling the bruises and scratches of 3 decades ago…but decided to experiment with this….&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After several weeks of use I can happily report the very pleasant high quality shaves delivered by this razor:&lt;br /&gt;(a) I get close smooth shaves after 1-2 passes, using the mere weight of the razor; the quality and speed of the shave beats any multi-blade razor&lt;br /&gt;(b) I did not get even a single bruise, not even a mild scratch&lt;br /&gt;(c) The Astra blades can last  a week before they begin to feel blunt… I change blades every 3-4 days….&lt;br /&gt;(d) The cost of a shave is negligible&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, if you want to liberate your face from  blunt-blades, multi-pass shaves that leave you with sandpaper and overpriced razors ….Get this safety razor to regain CLOSE SHAVES, IN 1-2 PASSES, AT NEGLIGIBLEPRICE…</li>
    <li> ...however, the only thing that&#x27;s holding me back is the fact that it becomes loose sometimes if I&#x27;m not paying attention. Other than that, I really like this model, I enjoy the experience, and it hasn&#x27;t let me down. I purchased Derby Extra Double Edge Razor Blades (25ct) and have been happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I had purchased another brand of safety razor and accepted the quality of the shave as typical of safety razors.  Not so!  This Merkur model 180 is another animal altogether!  The &amp;#34;example blade&amp;#34; which came with it is a Merkur brand blade and provided an excellent shave right out of the box!&lt;br /&gt;If you are interested in saving money and getting a quality shave then I heartily recommend the Merkur Model 180 Long Handle Safety Razor.&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the money spent and the money saved.</li>
    <li> Without a doubt this has been one of the best purchases I have made in a very long time. I recently upgraded my shaving routine from a Schick Hydro5, Gillette Fusion ProGlide Hydra Smooth shave gel, and Neutrogena Razor Defense post shave lotion. My new setup is this razor, Personna Double Edge Razor Blades, Taylor of Old Bond Street Sensitive Skin luxury saving cream and I have maintained the use of the Neutrogena Razor Defense. I have always had a problem with irritation and found the cost of cartridges for the Hyrdo5 to not be cost effective considering the shave was not really helping. This new setup has been working great to get me a close shave without irritation and I haven&#x27;t cut myself once.&lt;br /&gt;This particular razor is great, the long handle gives me a familiarity of a typical multi-blade razor and the head holds the blade in firmly. There really isn&#x27;t much to one of these, it&#x27;s simple and effective. I really do love it, and the blade that comes with it is a nice add-on!</li>
    <li> If you have never used ome of these do read the instructions so you know how to screw everything together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that being said. This razor and the blade it comes with, works soooo so much better than any of the Gillete or other mens disposable razors I have used before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does take alittle longer to shave with it, but I had next to no razor burn after my first time using it. I cut myself once but it still didnt hurt as much as cutting myself with the Gillette disposables.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore this is going to save me alot of money as the blades aren&#x27;t nearly as expensive either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great buy all around.</li>
    <li> This is my first safety razor and have been using it about a month.  I love this razor.  I will never go back to cartridges.  Price was great and previous reviews stated all I needed to know.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to the double edged safety razor scene. This is my first one. There are hundreds of different brands out there, but I based my purchase off the wonderful reviews this razor got. I had my first shave with it just the other day, using the included razor blade, and I loved it! I actually can&#x27;t wait to shave again, as crazy as that sounds. I definitely recommend. Especially if you&#x27;re like me and have sensitive skin</li>
    <li> I bought this for my brother a few Christmas&#x27;s ago and he loves it. Closest shave he&#x27;s ever gotten and without cutting himself! That&#x27;s almost unheard of. I got him some blades for it and they lasted a really long time. Once you master this razor, you apparently never want to go back to any other kind.</li>
    <li> Well made, it perfectly fits the blade. I went over the reviews before buying the long or short handle, I ended up with the long handle and honestly doubt there is any practical difference unless you have really small or very large hands. For the average guy the long handle will do fine. There is all this nonsense about novice nicks/cuts and right technique and the right weight of the device and pressure.... it&#x27;s all nonsense. I started using this safety razor a few weeks ago essentially every 2-3 days and so far so good. If you can see, if you not in a hurry, if don&#x27;t have any neurological condition , there is no way you should have a blood trial with this. So discard all that nonsense, just make up your mind about what would fit for you and get it. The razor will last forever (or at least my lifetime), it&#x27;s very user friendly in terms of assembling and cleaning and it is a good idea to get a stand for a few reasons: a razor blade device should not be lying around in the bathroom; it helps with the drying; and it&#x27;s very likely you be getting a brush (in which case a stand is a must). It is an initial investment but the outcome is certain: it will be cheaper in the long run and nature will not have to digest another several hundred pieces of disposable razors.  I did research other brands but here again: this device does exactly what is supposed to; it&#x27;s made to last; and is affordable. People that complain horrors about this razor probably fit one the health conditons or time limitations I mentioned above.  The blade (regardless of which) fits perfectly in place. To clean it I dont even bother disassembling it: just loosen the cap and run through a jet of water; hang to dry without fastening. A blade (Merkur) usually lasts 8-10 shaves.  I&#x27;m using glycerin soap but haven&#x27;t finished my quest on the lathering (but the soap is the cheapest option by far - and the idea is to keep it cheap)</li>
    <li> Awesome.  Not going back to disposibles</li>
    <li> hubby loves this!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I grew tired of paying big $ for blade replacements for my mega-bladed razor, so after reading many reviews on the cost and benefits of using a safety razor I decided to jump in and all I can say is I&#x27;m glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMO this is a well made unit with some definite heft to it and it is well assembled. I have large hands and the extra length suited me well. The handle is machined to aid in wet grip and it allows for a sure grip in wet conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blade changes are done simply by unscrewing the handle, popping the head off and replacing the old blade with the new. It&#x27;s not push-a-button-click-in-the-new-cartridge quick, but it&#x27;s easy and quick non the less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With most safety razors there is a lot of discussion on shaving technique, shaver head angle, proper beard preparation, etc when using this method. It&#x27;s all valid but don&#x27;t make more of it than it is. Yes, you will have to hold the razor at a 30 degree angle to your face to get good results, but you&#x27;ll know you have the right angle by the feel as you shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, you should prep your stubble with plenty of hot water to soften it up and you&#x27;ll also want a good quality shaving cream/soap to insure a nick free shave. Yes, the blade is sharp but you&#x27;re not going to lop a finger off or open a vein the minute you set the blade to your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will find that adjusting your technique so that you&#x27;re taking shorter strokes works best over skin that is stretched tight (either by hand or shifting your jaw). You may also find that it takes you a bit more time to complete, but we&#x27;re taking a minute or two not anything significant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simple, common sense stuff IMO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, when you&#x27;re done shaving you&#x27;ll find that you have as close a shave as any multi-bladed cartridge ever hoped of providing at a fraction of the cost. You don&#x27;t need five vibrating blades with lubrication strips and skin conditioners built in to get a quality shave at a cost of $4-5 per cartridge, all you need is this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed.ge, all you need is this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Decided to get into shaving the &amp;#34;old fashioned&amp;#34; way, and needed a handle.  This works amazingly, and I can&#x27;t imagine I&#x27;ll ever need another one.  Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> This is my first safety razor, so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to. I didn&#x27;t really know if I should have picked the normal or long handled one, but I&#x27;m glad I chose the long handled because it&#x27;s about the same length as my normal old razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt like this deserved a top ranking because so far it seems very solid and well made.  It&#x27;s very easy to insert a new blade into, and also very easy to clean.  I&#x27;m not even sure how this could break on you it is so well put together.  You just unscrew the handle from the rest of the razor and then everything slides apart easily.</li>
    <li> Best shave I have ever had, I have been using gillette for years.  Never going back!  I will recommend to all my friends.</li>
    <li> I have gotted tired of spending money on all the other razors.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this for a month know and it has given me the closest shave i remmember.&lt;br /&gt;i am looking at ordering a spare to put in my travel bag!!!&lt;br /&gt;the Merkur 180 safety razor has a nice feel adn wieght to it.&lt;br /&gt;a fantastic close shave and no cuts..... i was a little nervous at first about shaving with a safety razor over the conventional razors like my Mach 3 and Fushion. but they are in the trash can now!!!</li>
    <li> Recently switched to the world of DE razor shaving after using the mulitple-blade cartridge razors for years.  After reading some online reviews for this razor, I decided to try the Merkur 180 long handled safety razor.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier with the choice!    The longer handle feels more comfortable in my hand, and generally fits very nicely.  The razor itself is well made, and has a decent heft to it.  I find I don&#x27;t need to apply much pressure at all using it.  Right now I&#x27;m using the beginner&#x27;s type Van der Hagen soaps and boar brush, which are adequate.  Recently ordered some higher level soaps and a badger brush, and will be playing with blade brands to see what works best - and I expect the results will be ever better with this razor once I find the soap that gives me the smoothest glide for the blade.    You will have a learning curve, as I suspect will be the case when going from cartridge razor to ANY DE razor.  I do have make a few passes over certain areas of my face, but I think that&#x27;s me and having to learn the muscle memory to keep the proper blade angle.  I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 weeks now, and have yet to really nick myself.    All in all - for someone just getting in to the world of DE razor shaving, I think the Merkur 180 is a great choice.</li>
    <li> I recently decided to upgrade from my parker 22 razor to a Merkur. It is amazing how much better the shave is with the Merkur. Much closer, smoother.  I highly recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> I bought this Merkur razor about a year ago and have been using it pretty much every other day since then.  There isn&#x27;t much to it, there is a handle and the two pieces between which the blade is clamped.  It is a little pricey for what it does, but considering that it is made in Germany where workers generally are paid a living wage, I guess it is reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;The build quality is superb, each piece has a heft to it and feels really solid.  It has not lost its shine even after a year of use and the blade is always centered between the two sides.  I feel that this razor will easily last me another 10 years and beyond.  It is totally worth it!</li>
    <li> The Merker 180 long safety razor is the best thing I have ever scraped across my face! I have very sensitive skin and am prone to breakouts, and shaving has always been a challenge because in addition I am also...err...hairy. I have tried tons of razors; electric, disposable, the pro glides and fusions etc., and even going to barber shops and having it done there (this was the best but was much too expensive since I seem to grow a beard every morning). With the exception of the barber shop shaves, all the shavers/razors aggravated my skin no matter how much cream or foam I used. The Merker is different though, the blade it came with is perfect, and should get even better because I saw on some man sites that the Merker blades themselves are not the best. I ordered a pack of 7 different blades to use (total of 100) and will be testing them to find which one I like most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that praise being said, if you plan on getting this, please read guides and watch videos on how to use it because this is not a \\&quot;safe\\&quot; device like those plastic things or electric shavers. The first 4-5 times I used it were very difficult and scary because there is no real \\&quot;guard\\&quot; to block the blade from biting into your skin (there is actually a guard block thing but it allows much more blade to come out than I was used to which &#x3D; scary).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that to best use the blade, first either take a shower or use a wet + warm/hot towel and put it on your whiskers to soften them up a bit and \\&quot;open your pores\\&quot;, whatever that means :\&lt;br /&gt;Next, don&#x27;t use any of that gel/foam crud that comes in a tube but rather go old school and use a BADGER (more expensive than the other option, boar, but WELL worth it because it is MUCH softer and lathers better) shaving brush and a shaving soap of your choice (old school companies or new age stuff that smells like old spice, it doesn&#x27;t really matter as long as its shaving soap that you make into a lather yourself, I use [[ASIN:B000BP236I Geo F. Trumper Rose Soft Shaving Cream in Bowl 200 g cream]], but really, whatever works best for you. The reason for avoiding the new tube crud is because it does vile things to your skin and doesn&#x27;t really make a good \\&quot;glide\\&quot; like it claims. Google how to make a good lather because it&#x27;s really helpful to see how to turn move the brush in the bowl)&lt;br /&gt;Lather up&lt;br /&gt;Now for the shaving part, hold the handle LIGHTLY and hold it towards the end of the handle. Let the weight of the razor do the scraping, and don&#x27;t go against the grain (your whisker point a direction when they grow long enough, usually down from your sideburns to your chin, so shave from the sideburns downward) until you have done this a few times. The reason for this is because it is easy to cut yourself with this compared to the new stuff most people are used to which doesn&#x27;t need any form of skill to use. When shaving, don&#x27;t do long strokes, but rather do short, repetitive strokes and rinse the blade off in warm/hot water every few inches so that the fuzz that accumulates doesn&#x27;t block more fuzz from being shaved.&lt;br /&gt;After your all smooth, use a small towel and soak it in cool/cold water and put that on your face where you just shaved for 10-20 seconds to \\&quot;close your pores\\&quot; (Google it! I really don&#x27;t get it either but I have noticed that when I don&#x27;t do this I tend to get more red and pimply later). Also, use the towel to wipe off any soap lather that might be left in the nooks and cranny&#x27;s of your face because if you don&#x27;t wipe it off it gets flaky and looks like you are shedding skin (you&#x27;re not, its dried soap)&lt;br /&gt;Done!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave takes just as much time as anything else if you take out the whole lather and towel thing, and you &#x27;could&#x27; dry shave if you are experienced enough and in a major rush, but I don&#x27;t think anyone should dry shave with any razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please don&#x27;t start shaving with this after only reading my review, Google how to properly shave with a safety razor so you know what you&#x27;re getting into and so you won&#x27;t nick yourself the first time you try to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any question, just comment and I&#x27;ll respond.ck yourself the first time you try to use it.     If you have any question, just comment and I&#x27;ll respond.</li>
    <li> I remembered my father using the basic two sided safety razor when I was young and I probably started out using one myself but I really don&#x27;t remember.  I decided to try it again double edge blades are inexpensive when compare to those used in multi blade razors on the market now.  I have been using it for about a month now and find it to be very useful.  It gets the job done with the only caution being care taken because cuts seem to appear more often.  One has to not apply much pressure and the razor works well.  This particular brand razor is the only one I have used and it is fine.  Cleans easily and blades seem to last a long time.</li>
    <li> I wanted to give this razor 5 stars since its my first DE and I fell in love with the quality of shave it gives. It feels great in the hand and I had virtually no learning curve it just felt right. I appreciate the audible feedback I get since I barely feel the razor cutting at all using feather blades and proraso cream. My gripe is that the blade does not center itself correctly when inserting a new one. I don&#x27;t know if its just mine or if others notice this also but its enough to annoy me. I have to adjust and readjust and sight down the edge every time to get it just right. I don&#x27;t think it should be that difficult to capture a blade and keep it from being askew but mine has wiggle room. -2 stars. Dunno, maybe its just mine</li>
    <li> For me waxing causes ingrown hairs, shaving never really worked, and both left nasty red bumps.  Asked waxing lady (mistress of pain) about the red, itchy bumps and she said &#x27;you have coarse hair and sensitive skin, that&#x27;s what you&#x27;ll get&#x27;.  Then, my son just starting to shave got this razor, his girlfriend started using it, then got her own, and both told me &#x27;you have to be careful not to get cut, but NO RAZOR BURN&#x27;.  As an extreme favor I got to use my son&#x27;s (for legs, underarms) and it&#x27;s as if the hairs leap onto the blade.  Complete SMOOTH shave, NO red bumps at all.  EVER.  Got my own.  Don&#x27;t use those plastic things with 5 blades and vaguely sexy names any more.  BTW, my advice, get the long handled one, son&#x27;s girlfriend and I agree long handle is best for legs.  Oh, and also I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s much danger of cutting yourself, you&#x27;d have to be almost trying.</li>
    <li> This is definitely better than using a disposable razor.  Beware first time users. Expect to get cut up the first time you use it.</li>
    <li> Best shave of my life with this razor!!  Buy it and you will love it!  This is a great investment!</li>
    <li> I have always disliked shaving. I have tried cartridges and electric and they always left me razor burned. I purchased this razor after reading an article about using safety razors. It has taken me a little bit of getting used to but after the first shave I was hooked. I have been shaving with this razor and am in the process of trying an assortment of blades to see which one works the best for me. I have experienced no razor burn for the last three months of shaving with this razor. It has been a great razor.</li>
    <li> Keeping a clean cut is important for my woman, but I&#x27;m not a fan of overpaying for new razor cartridges every few weeks. This Merkur Model 180 is a no brainer. It&#x27;s quite sturdy and gets the job done just as good (actually much better) than any other razor I&#x27;ve owned. It feels very nice in your hands and you begin to look forward to shaving every week. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months and don&#x27;t really know why I haven&#x27;t started before. I will never buy another plastic razor cartridge again. I&#x27;ve even convinced my dad to get one too. Once I have kids of my own, I will teach them to shave using this as well. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I bought one of these razors for my husband as a Valentine&#x27;s gift this past February. This has to be one of the best gift purchases that I have ever made. We&#x27;ve been married 10 years and during those 10 years not one week had gone by when he wasn&#x27;t complaining about the sensitivity of his face and the fact that he HATES shaving and there are NO good razors or shaving products out there period. Since purchasing this razor for him (and a good badger brush and good soap) I haven&#x27;t heard him fuss at all. Instead he takes his time and enjoys shaving now. His razor burn and all of those nasty little red bumps have also disappeared. Tempted by his sudden change in attitude I decided to try his razor out for myself so after asking my husband if he minded (he laughed and asked why he should mind) and running his safety razor under some scalding water and allowing it to cool off and changing out the blade I used it to shave my legs. Wow. My leg&#x27;s have never been smoother. I won&#x27;t say that I haven&#x27;t cut myself with this razor. I am a klutz so no matter what razor I use I am going to cut myself I will say though that I had a lot fewer cuts and it didn&#x27;t hurt nearly as bad as the damage I usually do with an expensive disposable Mach 3 or 4 or whatever blade and handle. The cut also healed quicker and didn&#x27;t leave a scar (and I have a few scars on one ankle from a \\&quot;top brand\\&quot; razor). I had to buy myself one of these razors last month and couldn&#x27;t be happier. I think pretty much there&#x27;s really nothing that I can say that hasn&#x27;t been said before regarding the precautions and just the general differences between going from a disposable razor blade to this safety razor. Just let me agree with these points 1.) this razor heats up fast and it holds heat you will burn yourself if you get the water too hot 2.) lather and a lot of it and a lot of water are a must 3.) you don&#x27;t have to take forever to shave but just realize that you cannot race through shaving with this razor 4.) you do have to pay closer attention to what you are doing with this razor than others 5.) you do have to be aware of the angle that you hold this razor at and the amount of pressure you are using to shave 6.) and this one&#x27;s my husband&#x27;s - he says it&#x27;s a female thing - do not leave it in the shower, I&#x27;ve done this a few times by mistake and it never caused any rust to the razor itself but the sample blade that I was trying out was ruined.    As far as going through the blades themselves- I go through them fairly quickly - about one a week. My husband uses one maybe every two weeks (he usually only shaves every other day). The blades are so cheap. That&#x27;s the great thing because before I would burn through replacement blades with the plastic razors and my husband would gripe about the expense. And oh my goodness the other ones are expensive. I would fuss every time I had to buy them. But these are so cheap and you have so many options so many different brands and types of blades to try out and decide which works for you and so many different nicely scented soaps and oils that shaving really has stopped being a chore.    All in all this razor makes a great gift for others as well as to yourself. My husband and I have enjoyed these so much that I&#x27;m planning on getting a couple to give for Christmas this year.</li>
    <li> This is the first safety razor I have owned.  I just read some reviews of others who recommended the longer handle and the whole thing works well for me.  There isn&#x27;t anything wrong with this.  It works well,  Feels great in the hand due to its solid weight.</li>
    <li> This razor coupled with quality blades provides an outstanding shave.  The money you will save and the satisfaction from a quality shave make this a great value.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have very coarse, thick facial hair.  I only shave every two or three days.  I&#x27;ve been shaving with an electric razor in colder weather &amp; disposable blades &amp; the multiple-blade cartridges in Summer.  In warmer weather, the slightest bit of moisture/perspiration on the face doesn&#x27;t allow an electric razor to slide around smoothly.  When I saw prices of $35.00 for a package of replacement cartridges, I started thinking...\\&quot;Hmmm, it doesn&#x27;t make sense to buy the cartridges when I can buy a one-blade D.E. razor like the Merkur for around the same price &amp; blades are cheaper, too.\\&quot;  I watched a few videos &amp; here is what I experienced during my first three shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shave #1:  I didn&#x27;t have any shaving cream or shaving soap so I just used hand soap.  I had to keep reminding myself that applying pressure on the handle doesn&#x27;t give you a closer shave - it just cuts you.  I also learned something else (the hard way).  I now have something I never had prior to losing 85 lbs - a protruding Adam&#x27;s Apple &amp; I have to shave that area carefully since it no longer has that layer of.... uh....\\&quot;protection\\&quot; the extra chin used to provide.  That was the only place I cut myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shave #2:  While waiting for my Shaving Soap &amp; brush to arrive, I bought some \\&quot;Kiss my Face\\&quot; shaving lotion.  I did much better this time.  I paid attention to not applying any pressure, except below my lower lip where the hair is more stubborn - &amp; that&#x27;s where I cut myself when I applied pressure.  I also reopened the previous Adam&#x27;s Apple cut that hadn&#x27;t completely healed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shave #3:  NO CUTS ANYWHERE - not even the Adam&#x27;s Apple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For all three shaves, I used the one Merkur blade that comes with the shaver.  Knowing something about metal, I have been applying a touch of Mineral Oil on the blade after air drying to prevent corrosion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CAUTION.  10-30-13:  Today was my 4th shave with the Merkur.  While shaving, I got a pretty good cut on my chin.  It took mea minute to figure out what caused it.  As I removed the handle, I found that it was loose.  That allowed the head to turn, slicing instead of shaving.  I suggest you make sure the head is screwed on snugly before shaving.  That applies to any razor with this design.  Also, when reassembling the shaver with the blade in place, there is really no safe place to touch the head. The sides where the blade protrudes will expose your fingers to the blade and the shorter ends where the sides of the blade are exposed can also cut you; they are just LESS sharp than the blade side.  I am changing to a razor with a butterfly-type closure.</li>
    <li> This has saved me so much money.  I can buy inexpensive safety razor blades for a few pennies  instead of 3-5 bladed monsters for a few dollars each.  The performance depends on which blades you choose.  Choosing a blade is a very personal matter.  The brand that I like someone else might hate.  The best advice to those new to wet shaving is buy a large sampler pack of blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***6 year update.  It is still going strong after 6 years of abuse (not always cleaning it, leaving it in a damp shower)</li>
    <li> did  a lot of research on razors before I picked this one the reviews on it is what sold me on it  Husband really likes it weight and feel of it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a good experience with double-edged shaving.  3 of my first 4 attempts resulted in very minor unnoticeable nicks (I shave in the evening so if anything does happen I have a half-day for my face to recover) but my last two attempts were perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My results are comparable to a disposable, except that less passes are required.  I find against-the-grain results best for me, which is how I used to shave with my disposable.  It seems natural to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As long as you take your time starting out, it should be a good experience.</li>
    <li> Easy to learn after a few times. Never had a better shave in my life. Fast, Easy to change out the blades. Make sure you lather up good multiple times if you&#x27;re first getting into a Safety razor.</li>
    <li> Well i have used it for almost three weeks now and it is perfect and the replacement blades can be bought for 50 cents or less each.Its a lot cheaper then paying 20 bucks for a 5 pack of mach 3 blades</li>
    <li> My husband loves this razor. Clean, closer shave and the razor blades are so much cheaper than buying refill cartridges for the traditional style razors.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally comment on other reviews but I have read how this style of razor is dangerous, heavy, difficult to clean. All non electric razors intended for shaving are inherently dangerous and consider you are running it across your face and neck. Of course this is heavy it&#x27;s not plastic, this razor is not difficult to clean, simply loosen the handle and run under hot water to clean; if you want thorough blade cleaning remove handle and clean entire blade it is very simple. Common sense tells you to take your time, but these style of razors are not difficult to work with at all, don&#x27;t ever run the blade from side to side, prep your beard with soaps, oils, or whatever cream works for you- for tough beards you might want to start shaving with growth of your hair and maybe try shaving perpendicular to your hair and of course followed by the dreaded against the grain (ouch!). Overall this is a good razor and a cost effective way to due our daily business and don&#x27;t forget about buying good quality blades IE Astra platinum double edge. Give this type of razor a try, you won&#x27;t be let down; your face will thank you, your significant other will thank you and so will your wallet. Don&#x27;t believe the lies, safety razors are not difficult to use.  Bottom line, this razor works good, lasts long time.</li>
    <li> It makes shaving a pleasure again.</li>
    <li> Love it! Feels great to shave with! Would buy another and recommend to others</li>
    <li> A lot different then the normal razor I used to use, but once you get this one down, its great!</li>
    <li> Excellent razor for the money. I stepped up from a no name $12 razor and this thing is WAY better. I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> My husband wanted this type of razor. I found the quality almost comparable to my grandfathers razor from the 1960&#x27;s. He likes the weight and the way it moves as he shaves. His razor arrived before the expected date and the packing was secure. Thank you</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times but it&#x27;s amazing! Using a double edged safety razor is the only way to go.</li>
    <li> My husband has to shave everyday and his skin can become irritated. My brother suggested this item to me.&lt;br /&gt;This razor is very heavy duty, does a close shave and does leave razor burn. He loves it. It was worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Good, sturdy construction. However, I&#x27;m always worried I&#x27;m going to cut myself replacing the blades.</li>
    <li> If this is your first jump to true shaving just do it.  I have hard water and have had no problems with it.  Only comes with one blade so look for some sort of variety pack and find what you like.  Very good price for years of service</li>
    <li> I very much enjoy this razor. Once you get used to it, shaving is a breeze and a joy. It makes using any other type of razor a chore. The only reason I removed a star was the handle length. I thinking that a long handle would give balance and make it slightly easier to use. Other than that, I have no issues.Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought the Merkur after reading the positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;It sounded like a solid way to start learning to use a DE razor.&lt;br /&gt;Alas it turns out all DE razors are not created equal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Merkur is a three piece razor.&lt;br /&gt;This means the handle screws thru the base and into the top.&lt;br /&gt;To load the blade unscrew the top, place the blade on, screw it back.&lt;br /&gt;Simple. Yet when I tried this with the supplied blade the safety guide was too close to the blade&lt;br /&gt;and extended a 1/8\\&quot; beyond the blade.&lt;br /&gt;There was no angle I could hold the razor to make the blade touch skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought maybe I did something wrong, but the razor only fits together one way.&lt;br /&gt;I took it to my dad and asked if I just didn&#x27;t know what I was doing with a DE razor,&lt;br /&gt;he had the same issue.&lt;br /&gt;Short story, this razor cant cut hair it cant reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also being a three piece, its stability is all on the strength of the threads of the screw.&lt;br /&gt;I cant see this thing aging well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned it, (amazon was great about it)and bought a Parker 99 R.&lt;br /&gt;WAY BETTER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Parker is a butterfly open razor.&lt;br /&gt;You turn the bottom and the top opens like butterfly wings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the design used by Gillette since the &#x27;30s.&lt;br /&gt;Ebay has several 40yr old Gillettes for sell. I bought one, it still works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However the Parker has a longer handle than a Gillette and is heavier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip this razor, buy the Parker 99 R.</li>
    <li> I have been using this razor for about 5 months now and I&#x27;ve never been happier with a razor.  It&#x27;s just the right size to handle with ease and gives me very close shaves.  I find these razors so much more cost effective and \\&quot;green\\&quot; than the disposable type.  I would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> I wanted something inexpensive and unique. I purchased this along with the VanDerHagen Men&#x27;s Luxury Shave Set. It was a huge hit! My boyfriend - and half brown man whose facial hair needs shaving at least weekly to maintain the clean -to- 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look- -loves it! We are thinking of purchasing other blades for the razor --He watched a few You Tube videos that explained more about it. But the handle is long enough, sturdy enough, and the blade has lasted at least 4-5 shaves thus far. I highly recommend and will be purchasing more for Christmas gifts!</li>
    <li> This is my husband&#x27;s first safety razor. He was a little intimidated at first,  but he hasn&#x27;t had any issues.  I love the super close shave. Its leaves his face super smooth. He says he will never go back to that five blade razor!</li>
    <li> Two weeks ago I began to take on this revived phenomenon in shaving with soaps, badger hair brush and a safety razor. My dilemma was:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1- I have sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;2- I was not comfortable using a legit straight razor&lt;br /&gt;3- Likes that my Schick Quattro had a gel strip that for the most part cut down on irritation (and this didn&#x27;t)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been pleasantly surprised with this safety razor. Not only has it been less irritating that any other &amp;#34;store bought&amp;#34; razor it has actually allowed me to increase my shaving frequency which is huge! Blade replacement is so simple- unscrew the handle unload the blade and insert the new one. The two sided blade is so nice and makes shaving quicker than you would expect. I would highly recommend this product and even though it is a little more of an investment- believe me you will not be disappointed. I always thought those gel strips on the &amp;#34;store bought&amp;#34; razors were the key to less irritation. This has debunked that myth. If you are worried about irritation try this razor and put those fears behind you.</li>
    <li> This is the only razor I will ever use. I still am using the same blade and it&#x27;s been a year now. the blade has lasted me and still lasting me a while and still cuts very well. I shave every week and have thick hair. To clean it while I shave I just unscrew it a little bit by twisting it and then rising it in water, then retwist to secure and shave again. Takes 5 seconds to do.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m fairly comfortable with wet shaving, i have been for about 8 months now and i was getting really decent results using a refurbished Gillette tech razor from the 70s. the problem was even with the proper technique and caution the tech was giving me consistent nicks. I accidentally dropped my tech and broke off the screw rendering it useless and i now own this Merkur razor and i am blown away by the difference. I have never had a better shave with ZERO nicks and a perfectly smooth result. in comparison i believe used safety razors can be rendered faulty after years upon years of use. so having this brand new razor was the way to go, it&#x27;s slightly more aggressive than the Gillette tech but i would still consider the 180 a very very forgiving razor, however it just leaves a closer shave. your far less likely to have razor burn,bumps and or cuts when your using the Merkur 180. for blades i use Gillette 7 O&#x27;clock black labels with platinum. You also have to do a lot less work to get an amazing shave. I will not be going back to any other razor, this is my new one  and only. If your like me and are discovering the world of wet shaving, do your self a favor, stay off of ebay buying antiques, and use this amazing razor. it&#x27;s the perfect starting point for any wet shaver. Absolutely Fantastic quality and results.</li>
    <li> I bought this when I was new to wet-shaving and it is definitely one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made since I started. I still use it as my main razor. It&#x27;s heavy, which makes shaving much easier, but not too heavy, which makes holding it really comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cutting yourself is actually difficult, and I&#x27;ve become comfortable enough with it now that it takes me 5 to 10 minutes to shave at most (if I have a heavy beard). Overall I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great old fashion razor blade.</li>
    <li> Easily loaded, it&#x27;s heft promotes an easy comfortable shave and the grip is long enough to be comfortable in larger hands.</li>
    <li> I recently switched to double edge wet shaving and this was the razor I chose. I picked this one because I have larger hands (XL-XXL glove size) and I&#x27;m really glad I did.  The handle is about 4 inches long and has plenty of room to maneuver my hand to just the right place for a comfortable hold.    The handle has a nice criss-cross etching that provides a very good grip, even with wet hands.      I looked at getting the more popular Merkur HD, but opted for the longer handle of this model.  The head is the same as the Merkur HD, so you will get the same great shave from either.    This is a great first double edged safety razor.  It&#x27;s a very good quality metal and construction, should last many many years.</li>
    <li> This razor bends and exposes the blade at simply the perfect angle for a perfect shave. I&#x27;ve tried other less expensive models for use as a travel razor and well you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve owned this model for 7 years, I&#x27;ll probably be using the same razor for the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> After a few shaves I was able to get the hang of shaving with a light touch which is what is required.  Also make sure you buy a after shave balm of sometype as it will really help with any possible razor burn.  Also don&#x27;t use regular shaving gel or foam get the real shaving cream and use that it also helps the razor glid over the skin.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor two years ago.  It is the only safety razor I have used so I have nothing to compare it to but it has served me well.  Replacing the blades can be a bit harrowing so I think I will try a butterfly style for my next purchase.  That is, if I ever do buy another one as this one has shown no substantial wear.</li>
    <li> This is my first safety razor and after 2 weeks of using it I can say that I love it! I got the long handle with the guard. It took a few shaves to get used to but this gets me a closer shave than my Gillette Mach 3 I previously used. I have yet to cut myself with it and I haven&#x27;t had any razor burn so far. Its very smooth and you don&#x27;t have to apply much pressure. I use Proraso cream and a perfecto badger brush.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this razor and has never gone back to disposable razors ever again.</li>
    <li> My first safety razor and it works great no cuts and it&#x27;s really easy to use. I will save a lot of money over fusion blade that cost like 3$  blade.</li>
    <li> I will never go back to the flashy overdone blades all over the market now. This is the way to go. Love it.</li>
    <li> nice weight and quality</li>
    <li> Razor has a nice weight to it. The DE blade that came with it works pretty reasonably too. This is my first safety razor and is thus far working as expected. No complaints!</li>
    <li> I recently made the decision to ditch my cartridge razor and go with a safety razor, and after reading great things about this razor in particular, I can guarantee that it lived up to its name. This razor gives a spectacular close shave, and you can hear each individual hair being cut as you shave. I definitely recommend this razor!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this razor.  I got tired of paying $3.50 per cartridge for the multiple blade monstrosities.  The Astra blades that I use with this razor cost about 10 cents a blade and provide an awesome shave.  Although this razor is referred to as a &amp;#34;long handle&amp;#34;, don&#x27;t let that lead you astray, it is actually about the same length as a standard razor so it won&#x27;t see abnormally long, at least it didn&#x27;t to me.  The razor is well built, sturdy and attractive.  I love using it every morning.  One thing to think about though is that to achieve the super close shave you are looking for, you will probably have to do more than one pass, that kind of surprised me because I was new to DE shaving.  Bottom line is that it only takes a couple minutes more and the results are fantastic.  I use this with the Proraso shave soap, Escali badger brush and I store in on the Colonel Cronk razor and brush stand.</li>
    <li> I have gotten excellent shaves with this razor. I would prefer the top wings open by turning a knob on the bottom. Also I would prefer a more robust size to fit my hand.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t want to pay for cartridges anymore so I wanted to go with a safety razor. There is a learning curve, a LOT depends on which razor, and it isn&#x27;t as fast as doing a cartridge. However, it is a lot more fun. I have to go ever my fave multiple times, where I was under the impression I wouldn&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t know if because of the razor, technique, or the blades. Otherwise, it&#x27;s wonderful</li>
    <li> Dimensions are perfect and this razor works! Just got into shaving with safety razors since I got sick of buying expensive cartridge refills.</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s about all to say about it. If you&#x27;re in the market for a safety razor, then this is solid build quality without any of the decorative price frills. This should last you a lifetime, and you&#x27;ll save a ton of money while still getting a great shave. Go ahead and get proper shaving cream and a brush. It makes all the difference.</li>
    <li> Used this razor for the first time this morning...I was extra careful, went with the grain first pass, against the grain second pass, and came out with a great shave and no nicks. Feels good in the hand and easy to hold. The blade is well protected by the shape of the razor. Very good!</li>
    <li> Purchased from SimplyBeautiful.  Order was on-time and as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A shave with one of these razors is a pure joy.  The German made Merkur blades are not only extremely sharp but also much less expensive then the cartridge based blades.  The Model 180 is very hefty and beautifully made.  I have much less nicks with this safety razor than I did with the cartridge based razors.  I can&#x27;t recommend this razor highly enough.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this razor. I believe it works much better than the newer multi-blade razors. I get a very close and clean shave. I was able to get shaving soap and a shaving brush from my CVS pharmacy. I am using the Wilkinson blades.&lt;br /&gt;I seem to have a winning combination - great shave and no cuts and I will save a ton of money because the razors are so much cheaper.</li>
    <li> Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor  is top notch great! I love this razor for the price and quality. I have a thick beard and was trying to guess what razors to get. I ended up with the Astra Superior Premium Platinum Double Edge Safety Razor Blades which work great for sensitive skin. Similar handle size as the Mach series. I would recommend this razor to anyone. Its great and your cost will drop in price. This would be comparable to any of the expensive razors at Art of Shaving.</li>
    <li> Happy with this good quality razor. Easy to take apart and very sturdy. I am so happy I ditched my fusion for this. Feels so good in the hand and I get such a close shave. The cost savings are just a side benefit.</li>
    <li> Love it, love it. When combined with the Merkur blades this is a great shaving experience. I have been searching for an alternative to the dull but expensive commercial drug store brands for years, but didn&#x27;t want to go to a full straight razor experience. This is a great middle ground. It&#x27;s sharp, it&#x27;s easy to clean, it doesn&#x27;t clog easily, blades are cheap and strong. I especially like the fact that the whole thing is put together with basically one screwing action, so rinsing/unclogging is a very intuitive process. I highly recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> I had had the chance to use the razor for several months now and I love it! The price is great as is the quality. Having used disposable razors for years, this is a no comparison upgrade. Additionally, I have found that I have less redness and ingrown hairs have been eliminated. However, I understand that the blades are largely attributable for this, but the razor is a great too. So, anyone planning to make the switch from a disposable razor, I would highly recommend this razor!</li>
    <li> its good but have to watch that it stays tight on the blade. after a couple of uses handle gets loose so just tighten it up</li>
    <li> Made the switch from the throw-aways with this razor and have been happy overall. I wish it were a bit heavier in the hand, but it&#x27;s nice and holds the blade well for a pleasing shave. For blades, I like Merkur&#x27;s own brand.</li>
    <li> I really liked this razor, if I shave myself twice, it would leave my skin very smooth. While if I just shaved once, it would get rid of all the hairs and leave a little layer of hair (similar but smaller than an afternoon beard).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality is really good, I haven&#x27;t had the problem of the pin coming out, I treat it very delicately, I don&#x27;t put unnecessary pressure on it.</li>
    <li> This Razor lived up to my expectations, and the Merkur razor included stay sharp for a long time. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Been using this razor for well over two years now, I&#x27;m very happy with it. Medium length handle gives some great weight in my hand for some good control.</li>
    <li> The Merkur 180 is a fine razor for anyone starting out and the handle is perfect for shaving your legs.  It&#x27;s very mild.  The first time I used it, I nicked myself on the knee, but it didn&#x27;t hurt anything like a multi-blade cartridge does.  You know how a cartridge razor gives you something that stings like a paper cut?  This razor doesn&#x27;t do that.  If you have wispy leg hair, you&#x27;ll probably love this razor and it will be the only one you purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick, coarse, dark hair on my calves.  I could probably grow a leg beard like a lumberjack.  I used Feather blades with this (which are considered to be the sharpest you can buy), and that was the closest shave that I could achieve with this razor.  It just wasn&#x27;t good enough.  I knew my angle and prep were fine.  The razor just wasn&#x27;t aggressive enough for me.  Plus, Feather blades are expensive, especially when you&#x27;re going through one blade a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I bought an Edwin Jagger DE89L.  The first thing I noticed was how much heavier the EJ was, despite having a shorter handle.  You put it together the same way as the Merkur, but it&#x27;s just built better and the finish is nicer.  I loaded it with a Derby blade and after two passes, my legs were shaved just a little bit closer than I&#x27;d ever gotten with my Merkur and Feather blades.  Shaving with the EJ was also slightly more enjoyable for some reason.  The weight is shifted towards the head and it runs over your skin in a smoother way.  The Edwin Jagger Chatsworth is probably something I&#x27;ll purchase in the future, just to get that longer handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re just starting out, watch all the videos you can on double edge razors and wet shaving.  Hold the handle at a 30-45 degree angle and take slow strokes of around half an inch until you get used to the angle.  Make sure the cap (top piece of metal) is touching your skin at all times, and don&#x27;t pay attention to the guard (bottom piece of metal), otherwise you&#x27;ll scrape your skin instead of shaving it.  You can shave with canned foam, but you&#x27;ll find that the soaps and creams that require a brush are higher quality, cheaper, and last quite a bit longer.  The feeling of the brush against your skin is also pretty relaxing.  Wet shaving with my DE&#x27;s turned a chore into something enjoyable.</li>
    <li> I started wet shaving a little over a year ago. After much deliberation I initially bought the this and it has been my razor of choice up until two weeks ago when I purchased the [[ASIN:B002RBF1PO Edwin Jagger De89lbl Double Edge Safety Razor Chrome Plated Lined Detail, Chrome]]. The Merkur has a longer handle. Great for people with large hands. However, I found that the extra length caused the razor to bounce a bit and not stay flush with my skin at all times. This was especially tough on my neck. To make up for the razor not staying flush I tended to put extra pressure on the razor which lead to some nasty nicks and cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the whole idea to simply allow the razor to do the work I was finding it harder and harder to do so with the Merkur. I assumed this was much to do with operator error but wanted to try a different razor and find out. However, did I really want to spend another $37 on a razor when it could have simply been my technique? Not really. Finally, after much delay, I finally bought De89lbl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Putting off this purchase was the worst mistake I&#x27;ve made while DE shaving. What a difference the razor makes! It&#x27;s shorter, better balanced, and stays absolutely flush to my face and neck. Three shaves and not a single nick! I use [[ASIN:B001G5HZCY Feather Hi-Stainless Platinum Double Edge Razor Blades 30 Ct]] and the smoothness is amazing. Yes the Feather blades are VERY sharp. The razor comes with five Derby blades and they are where you should start before moving up to the feathers. However, anyone that already has been shaving with a DE razor for a while should be fine with the feathers. Just takes your time and let the razor do the work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to give the Merkur to anyone with larger hands anyone with smaller to medium sized hands should start with the De89lbl. Truly the best $37 I&#x27;ve spent all year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My routine:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B004K3QUSE Taconic Shave Unscented Organic Pre-Shave Oil (2 oz.)]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001L2U61E Proraso Shaving Cream With Eucalyptus Oil &amp; Menthol (5.2 oz.)]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B002JW8S6K Bloc Osma Natural Alum Block]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0007XBHIE Proraso Liquid Cream After-Shave (3.4 oz.)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy shaving!</li>
    <li> When I first started shaving I was using Gillette normal razors, then I went to the battery powered Gillette razors.  From there I decided I would try out electric shavers.  I tried out rotary and foil.  I felt like all of this did alright but I was still not getting the best shave.  When I saw this from Amazon saying there was a deal on this I decided what the heck.  It turns out I finally found the best way for me to shave.  The shave is clean and smooth.  The blades last longer for me than people say but my beard does not come in really thick.  At first I cut myself a few times and went really slow.  Now I can shave in a normal amount of time without cutting myself.  As when changing all shaving methods it takes a bit for your face to adapt and for you to learn how to shave with that device.  I find against the grain scarier (it feels like I am more likely to cut myself) but gives me a closer shave.  As far as direction, just test it a few different ways or do a different way on each side of your face.  When you find which direction works for you stick with it.  I am happy to use this razor and very pleased that the simplest method ended up being the one that worked the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heres the blades I bought, $15 for 30 blades isn&#x27;t bad especially when you do not have to constantly switch them out: [[ASIN:B000NCMMBA Merkur Combo Pack of 30 Razor Blades]]</li>
    <li> I have tried pretty much everything out there, Straight Razor, Pro Glide etc etc&lt;br /&gt;but nothing comes close to this. Shave is very close, It does not take too long to&lt;br /&gt;shave so it&#x27;s timing is better than Straight Razor also its much safer to use (no nicks/cuts)&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend it, Shave is close, not too time consuming and easy on the wallet.&lt;br /&gt;Once you use this you will never go back to regular commercial brands!!</li>
    <li> Solid well made razor.  Gillette and comparable products are a total rip off. This will give you the same or better shave for a fraction of the cost.</li>
    <li> It is an excellent product that is comfortable and easy to use. The weight, durability, and finish of it show that it is a quality product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only recently returned to a safety razor after paying way too much for Gillette Mach3 Power replacements.  Because I shave my entire head, I&#x27;m interested in closeness and comfort.  I bought the Merkur long handled razor, and after remembering the many cuts I used to get with a Gillette Fat Boy, I was very tentative the first few shaves.  As I eased into letting the weight of the razor do the work the shaves improved.  The long handle allows me to get into tight areas with a very light touch.  But, I still felt the shaves could have been better.  I initially used a Merkur blade, but a purchase of Derby blades has proven to be the real clincher.  While I&#x27;m aware that everyone has different skin and beard/hair texture (my skin&#x27;s somewhat sensitive - I could never use an electric - and my beard and hair are coarse), my brief experience has been that the Derby blades give me a closer and smoother shave.  This combination will last me for some time - I might buy another style safety razor just for fun - and I would heartedly recommend the razor and the Derby blades.</li>
    <li> this is my first DE razor and it wont be my last.  decent enough to get you started in this crazy obsession but there are other razors which are better for around the same price as this or just a bit more.  check out [...] for more infos</li>
    <li> Why pay $4 per cartridge when double-edge blades can be as cheap as 10 cents each?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched months ago and I&#x27;ve been very happy.</li>
    <li> I hope no one listens to people who think that this deliriously wonderful item is hard to learn how to use. Unless you are 16 years of age. It is so sweet and nostalgic to use this razor--remembering the &amp;#34;blade slot&amp;#34; in our family&#x27;s medicine cabinet. But the blades for this razor, regardless of the manufacturer last very much longer. It is a delight knowing that the four or five blade ruse is just that, a ruse to have unsuspecting consumers spend 3 USD for a cartridge, do not have to put up with that. Maybe 80 cents or so for a blade with so much joie is well worth the effort and change of habit.</li>
    <li> only with this device I feel safe.&lt;br /&gt;I remembered the old days&lt;br /&gt;each. shaving is a pleasure. very good&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful Razor.  It’s very much like the one I grew up with.  I was tired of paying the exorbitant price for replacement blades and wanted to go back to a simple double edge razor that have blades that are affordable.  This looked like it fit the bill.  Once again it is a beautiful razor, well made and I’m sure will last me the rest of my life.  The only problem is how it’s weighted.  The head is big and heavy and just doesn’t feel comfortable.  The razor shaves well….does a very nice job, but I end up gripping the handle very close to the head so the balance better.  I am a big man….6’5” 230 with big hands and I got this razor because it had a long handle.  I’m just disappointed in the overall ergonomics. It’s just not comfortable.  If your used to today’s light weight, plastic, 3 or 5 blade units, you like the way they shave and you can live with the cost of replacements blades….think twice before going to this style of razor.</li>
    <li> This is a solid razor that will last a long time. It looks classy and feels good in your hands. The reviews that say you can&#x27;t put any pressure on your face with this razor is not true, at least for me. I use the same pressure as a disposable but a lot depends on the blades. Some blades did nick me but one brand (Derby) was excellent. I just bought 200 of them for $15 on Amazon. Over time you will save a bundle using a double edge razor. The 200 blades should last me 5 years, that&#x27;s .08 cents a blade. I did think this razor was like the old type where it opens up in the middle to take the razor out, I didn&#x27;t look at it closely I guess. So, be careful twisting the razor to get the blade out, hold it on the sides without the blade. Shaving with this razor, single blades and better shaving soap, I believe, will be better on my face in the long run. I use a locally made, all natural shaving soap from a little soap shop that is great. However, with a DE razor you will have to go over your face a few times to get a really close shave, it is a single blade. Honestly, I get a close shave from a disposable and always have. But, I like the thought of saving money and shaving &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34;. I figure, if my grandfather and my father used this method then it might be good for me too.</li>
    <li> This is my first try at using traditional wet shaving for ladies, and while I&#x27;m still working on finding out which brand of blade I prefer, this razor has sturdily done it&#x27;s job through and through. Great for beginners, I&#x27;ve only cut myself once in about a month!</li>
    <li> Quality tool; world class manufacturer; fair price.  I don&#x27;t buy often but benefit from ratings - this one is a winner as advertised.</li>
    <li> Near perfect, but it needs to be cleaned often or it loses its effectiveness.</li>
    <li> Old way is the best way when it comes to shaving!  Here is the Proof.....Great shaves... really nice razor</li>
    <li> I prefer a &amp;#34;fatter&amp;#34; handle (arthritis in my hands like bigger) but it&#x27;s easy to see Merkur tried to make an &amp;#34;everyone&amp;#34; razor and to that end they did very well. No complaints which is rare for me. This is the &amp;#34;old faithful&amp;#34; tool you can count on for a good shave when you&#x27;re not quite awake in the morning.  A cup of morning coffee while you shave with this old friend. What a great way to start your day.............</li>
    <li> What is not to love, cheap, sharp, and solid well made blades. I&#x27;m so glad i ditched the gillette razors and went with a Merkur straight razor and safety razor</li>
    <li> I started shaving with a double edge because I was tired of $15 for the mach system. bought a cheap handle at first, then decided to purchase the merkur. the difference is night and day.</li>
    <li> My first shaving experience with this razor was horrible, my neck was left bleeding and all cut up from it. Expensive lesson</li>
    <li> Love it. I wish I switched to this razor earlier. Very well made and easy to hold and use.</li>
    <li> Works great. Easy to use. Easy to clean. The recommendations for this product are accurate. Great tool for shaving. Good grip.</li>
    <li> I love this razor! Let me preface by saying that I am a big guy. 6&#x27;2&amp;#34;, stout build, with large hands. The thought of using a razor with a smaller handle seemed ridiculous to me. I opted for the Merkur 180, it could not be any more comfortable in my hands. This razor coupled with a quality blade gives a fantastic shave!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor should last a long time. It really is a fine piece of craftsmanship.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. I&#x27;m new to the whole DE shaving but had great results. I recommend watching a lot of YouTube videos if you&#x27;re new as they are extremely helpful. Basic tip, don&#x27;t put pressure on it. My skin isn&#x27;t sensitive at all so I actually put a little pressure but haven&#x27;t had a cut yet. I usually do 3 passes, first with the grain, second across the grain, and third against the grain all under ten minutes. For the first time, I have baby smooth skin. Wish I had used this better though it depends on person - my father hates DE shaving and swears by his fusion razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As per shipping, my razor actually came chipped out of the box but I needed it so will keep it. Wish the seller would be more careful in packing the product. Shipping box had the products, receipt, and paper. Bubble wrapping would have been nice.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor for my husband&#x27;s birthday and it was one of the best birthday presents he has ever received.  My husband shave his face and head almost daily and would use the disposable razors.  If he went more than a day without shaving, he would have to take his clippers to trim down his hair before using the disposable razors.  The disposable razors were expensive and he would only be able to use them once.  I bought the Merkur because I read all of the positive reviews.  My husband says he will never use a disposable razor ever again.  I love it because he gets a real close shave and takes longer for the stubble to come back.</li>
    <li> This item, coupled with good shaving soap, has made me enjoy shaving.  After a bit of practice holding the blade and soap, the focus on shaving has made a once arduous task much interesting and enjoyable.  The razor is well constructed,easy to change blades, and feels nice in my hand.  Although I cannot compare to other safety razors, as its the only one I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
    <li> I have to say that it isn&#x27;t as close as a shave as I would have hoped but ,maybe I am doing something wrong. It is however the best shave I have ever had. I have dark hair and thick whiskers too. When I use disposables, I sometimes go through 2 in one shave. With the Merkur feather blades and this and the Col. Conk Bay Rum, shaving is a pleasure now. Not a chore. The blade just scrapes the hair right off of my face with ease. And when I am done shaving and apply a nice after shave lotion, it feels sooooooo gooood. No disposable has held a candle to this razor. I have only cut myself once and it was my fault. Remember people, apply almost no pressure. Let the weight of the razor head do the work. And always stay wet. I know some people don&#x27;t use shaving soap and that is fine if you are in a hurry. A good can of Barbersol or something can work. The thing is that shave creams and foams dry out rather quick and that can cause cutting and irritation. Soaps retaing moisture for a long time.</li>
    <li> I switched from the multiple blade plastic gimmicky razors to this after a friend referred me. It&#x27;s really disappointing to realize what I&#x27;ve been missing out on all these years! This razor is awesome and I really enjoy using it every day. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite razor. I have been using it now for three years. I&#x27;m very happy with the shave it gives me. It does however, have a learning curve. If you are new to wet shaving, then it may take you some time to get used to this type of razor. Especially if you have only used the cartridge type razors before.</li>
    <li> Great razor!  Heavy-weight and well-balanced.  My husband loves using it with the Van Der Hagen Men&#x27;s Luxury Shave Set I bought to go with it.</li>
    <li> Good weight. The razor does the work. This razor looks classy in the stand. Hopefully, it will last for years to come.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a month and I love it. Every morning I feel like I just came from the barbershop.  If you guys are looking for razor blades, I would recommend the \\&quot;100 Shark Super Chrome Double Edge Safety Razor Blades\\&quot;. They are awesome and this is where you will save money. They come 100 blades in a pack and they only cost about $18. I am so happy I bought this product.</li>
    <li> While I like the razor (my first DE Safety Razor, after 20 years with Sensor), I now wish that the handle wasn&#x27;t hollow so as to add more weight to the razor.  I find myself putting too much pressure on the blades and feel the need for more heft to the razor.  I do like the length but ended up ordering a solid metal replacement handle and am happier with my shaves now.</li>
    <li> I just started DE shaving about three weeks ago.  Before that it was all cartridge razors (Gillette Power/Schick Hydro 5, then Hyrdo 3)......kept trying to find new shave gels/creams/shave butters hoping something would end the bad razor burn I&#x27;d get on my neck.  Seemed things would go well for a few days, then it would all come right back.  Adding all those extra blades to your skin, along with multiple passes just isn&#x27;t good for the skin, period!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came across a [[ASIN:B0012Y1FCK Wilkinson Sword Classic Double Edge Razor + 5 Blades]] in WalMart one day, never even knowing DE razors still existed and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I was thoroughly impressed!!!!  If you&#x27;re just starting out, I suggest using the Wilkinson Sword, it&#x27;s lighter and seemed to be a great beginner&#x27;s razor in my experience.  With the Shea Moisture shave brush I got at Target, I was able to make a good lather with my [[ASIN:B001JHEY14 Proraso Shaving Soap, Ultra Sensitive Skin 5.2 oz (147 g)]].  I found a bunch of proper DE shaving technique videos on youtube, I HIGHLY recommend watching these (mantic59 posted them). After watching some other video reviews I decided to purchase the Merkur long handled razor.  I won&#x27;t go into detail about something I&#x27;m only a beginner at, but I can tell you I&#x27;ll never go back to using cartidges or gel again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you pre-wash your face with warm water, preferably out of the shower.........wash your face with a pre-wash or pre-scrub like [[ASIN:B002DYXXSM Every Man Jack Pre-Shave Face Wash, Signature Mint 5 oz]]/[[ASIN:B002ATII94 Every Man Jack Face Scrub]], then apply shaving soap.  Never shave with cold water as I&#x27;ve done before when it&#x27;s just too damn hot in the summer.....but finish with cold water closing your pores and your favorite post-shave balm/lotion.</li>
    <li> I loved this at first because the razor gives a great shave, but one aspect of it became irritating very quickly. The handle would turn as I was shaving causing the head to become loose, ultimately causing the blades to become loose and misalign.  I had to continuously pause to retighten the handle. I tried to solve this by putting a lock washer on it, between the handle and head. Don&#x27;t do this! It eventually caused undue pressure on the mounting shaft that comes out of the head and the shaft broke off. The razor is now in my recycling bin. I don&#x27;t recommend this product and would not purchase another one.</li>
    <li> Simple, easy to use, and ultra high quality.  This is simply the best razor I have ever seen or used.  Read th e reviews, this thing is highly regarded and lives up to it&#x27;s reputation.  I highly reccomend this product.</li>
    <li> Great razor...a little pricey but I don&#x27;t regret spending the money.  I get much closer shaves than with disposables and have stocked up on Feather razors.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a way to shave that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin forever.  I have tried every disposible razor on the market; 1,2,3,4 and 5 blades.  I have bought 2 different electric razors in hopes that they would solve the red, irritated skin I had after each shave.  For the last 15 years I stopped shaving from Friday-Sunday in order to give my skin a break and to let the redness go away.  I think that is all over now.&lt;br /&gt;I only just received mine on Monday (its now Thursday), but man I am impressed.  No redness, no irritation and a dang close shave.  It didn&#x27;t take me but a few minutes to discover the right angle and I haven&#x27;t severed a major artery yet :)&lt;br /&gt;So if you have sensitive skin and you&#x27;ve tried it all, look no more!  I would have never thought I would get excited about a razor purchase!</li>
    <li> I love this razor.  I had my other Merkur for about 2-3 years, but the screw on the top broke off.  I bought this Merkur to replace it.  While I really like it, I find the description deceiving since the handle on this is SHORTER than the handle on my original.  No way is this a long handle, it&#x27;s about 1/2-1 inch shorter.  Other than that, 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I have read all of the wonderful ratings about this razor i.e. how close it shaves, how your face will be baby soft, etc. etc. etc.  I have found this razor to be just an ordinary razor, similar to the one I used in the 60s. I followed all the recommendations on how to get a super close shave;  I took a hot shower kept my face wet, used a brush with good cream, and still my face is not soft, I can still feel the stubble. I used the fresh blade that came with the razor, and still a less that desirable result. I don&#x27;t understand how all of these ratings are so great on just a mediocre product, which is way over priced...</li>
    <li> Never though I would say this, but i honestly can&#x27;t wait to shave again. I&#x27;ve been using Gillette Mach 3 &amp; ProGlide for the past 10 years.. I literary had to wait 7 days before I could shave again. I have sensitive skin but thick hair. Used every possible cream (in a can) out there, and was never able to get rid of razor burns and bumps.. with this razor, its simply amazing, closest shave ever. My father and grandfathers used this, and now finally i&#x27;m using it too. Worth every penny and some. Get it, you won&#x27;t regret it, guaranteed.</li>
    <li> I like the razor itself. I do not see why it is called a long handled razor. It seems pretty standard to me and I couldn&#x27;t imaging how short the regular version is.</li>
    <li> Item came as described by seller, in perfect condition and in original box. Shipped in perfect timing as well. Nice job.</li>
    <li> Great shaver! i haven&#x27;t had any cuts on my face with this blade, its way better then buying cheap plastic razors. 5 Star Razor!!</li>
    <li> I switched to a Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor several months ago and I will never go back to those expensive Gillette refill cartridge razors. I&#x27;m not sure why they call it a long handled razor because it seems a little short to me, but it works fine either way. It feels nice and solid, not cheap. Much better deal and a better shave than my old Gillette Mach3 with the ridiculously expensive refill cartridges.</li>
    <li> Multi-Blade razors are a scam. The more blades they pack into a cartridge the more they can charge you and the faster it clogs up. Most are plugged before they ever become dull. The best shave I ever had was with a straight razor I used for years. No razor burn whatsoever. Then when I started shaving my head I just didn&#x27;t have the guts to keep using it. I switched to the multi-blade razors and have never had a really comfortable shave since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using the Merkur 180 less than a week ago and I love it. The only down-side is that because the head is broader than a cartridge razor I&#x27;ve had to reconsider my approach to shaving around my ears! If you&#x27;re just shaving your face it&#x27;s not an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been a long time soap and brush user so now that I&#x27;m only buying safety blades shaving costs me next to nothing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blade that comes with it seems a little more aggressive than some other brands so buy ten packs of different brands until you find one that really works for you. I prefer a &amp;#34;softer&amp;#34; blade than the Merkur but that is only a matter of the personal taste. I give the shaver top rating!</li>
    <li> My first safety razor and I&#x27;m glad I switched over. This is a very nice razor and looks great. Although all razors have a common purpose, to hold the razor. The Merkur sample razor worked well with me. Although I&#x27;m dying to dry my feather razors. Good product!</li>
    <li> Amazing. I feel like I&#x27;m taking excellent care of myself by shaving with this fine piece of machinery. I highly recommend this to any man that wants too feel awesome :)</li>
    <li> I have waited 2 years since my switch to a DE Safety Razor to finally write this review. I&#x27;ll admit: there was a bit of a learning curve. I had to figure out which blades were right for me and how to shave in an efficient yet close manner. Within a couple of months, I had it down. Every time I shave, I just feel my face all day long. Almost as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom. I will never look back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this with some derby blades, Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush, and Proraso Shaving Cream With Eucalyptus Oil &amp; Menthol (5.2 oz.). I nicked my face up more than I&#x27;ve wanted to with the derby blades. I read so many reviews that scared me away from the feather blades. I do not have a thick beard at all. I only need to shave every 2-3 days. Ironically, I cut myself MUCH more with the derby blades than the feather blades. Once I tried the feather blades, I just threw away my derby blades. I felt like I needed some aftershave lotion after using the derby blades, but stopped using it once I switched to feathers. Don&#x27;t need it. You have to find the blade that fits your skin the best. The feather blades made a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My brush is still in perfect condition, and I&#x27;m still going on my same tube of Proraso cream for almost 2 years now. This is what I do: soak my brush in hot water for 10 seconds, shake it out just a bit, add about a pea-sized of cream in a cup/mug, stir hard and fast, apply hot water to my face, and apply the cream to my face all over. I do my first pass with the grain. I try to stretch out my face skin where I can: like using my left hand to spread my skin on my neck to get a very close shave. I do not press hard but let the weight of the razor do the work. If you have the right angle, it&#x27;ll take care of it for you. I prefer short, repeated strokes. My second pass is against the grain, which is necessary to get my chin with a very close shave. I&#x27;m pretty much done after these two passes, but I do a very quick 3rd pass on my chin line, doing side to side. You just need to decide how many and which passes is best for your skin. I will cut myself once every 6 times or so. Usually it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m careless or don&#x27;t switch out my blades often enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once done, I rub cold water on my face, clean out my brush, mug, and rinse my razor and blade by taking it apart, drying, and putting it back together again. I will typically use my feather blade about 4-5 times, depending on how I feel the last shave went. Sometimes a blade deteriorates faster than others depending on conditions. Really like my Proraso cream, but it&#x27;s the only cream I&#x27;ve used for 2 years, and I&#x27;m curious to try something else once it runs out. It lasts forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a lot of research, and too many people said this razor was the best one. I have not tried any other safety razor, but this has worked perfectly for me. It still looks brand new after 2 years of use. Lastly, I suggest some type of cover or tiny zip case for the razor with a blade in it. I just left it in my toiletry bag by itself, hoping I&#x27;d be careful. I accidentally stuck my hand in there just perfectly that it deeply cut my finger. It was early in the morning, hadn&#x27;t had breakfast yet, and the pulsating pain in the tip of my finger actually caused me to pass out! lol. So be careful with these things and keep away from children.chin line, doing side to side. You just need to decide how many and which passes is best for your skin.

    <li> Merkur Long Handled Razor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;old fashion razor  cheeper to use. And give you the best close shave ever. I recommend this to all men or women who like close shaves  and soft skin.</li>
    <li> These things are a swift kick in the face to companies like Gillette, and for that, I thank the shaving gods for bestowing us men an affordable great shave, albeit slightly more time consuming. One HUGE bonus in addition to the affordability is the fact that I do NOT get any razor burn because this think doesn&#x27;t pull the hairs out and cut. No razor bumps if I take my time. Love it!</li>
    <li> My husband has been wanting one of these for a long time. I bought this with several accessories for him for Valentine&#x27;s Day. He can tell me all he wants that he doesn&#x27;t want a present...HE LOVED THIS ONE.</li>
    <li> The quality and craftsmanship of this razor is excellent. It has a nice weight and the textured handle provides grip even while shaving wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something to consider: The quality of the shave is only as good as the products being used in addition to this razor. If cheap, low-quality blades and shave cream are being used, then chances are there will be nics and cuts and possibly razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend investing in a quality face soap, pre-shave oil, and using a boar&#x27;s bristle brush to apply the shave soap. I have not ever cut myself nor developed razor bumps or burn shaving this way. Follow up with a alcohol free after shave lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have said previously, it is a time investment but it becomes an enjoyable part of my daily routine.</li>
    <li> The handle is comfortable to grip and is a good size for my hand.  It was very easy to switch from normal razors to this and shaving is much more enjoyable now.  I bought a badger hair brush along with this and the whole process of shaving in the morning just feels a lot more enjoyable now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my first 5 shaves with this blade and I love it.  I have not once cut myself and I&#x27;m getting some very good shaves.  Razor bumps are for the most part disappearing.  I&#x27;m a happy guy!</li>
    <li> I am blown away by the way the razor works I really can&#x27;t explain how good and close of a shave you get. Even though I shaved before taking a bath it didn&#x27;t even hurt when I got into the shower because the shave was so clean that it didn&#x27;t even leave any pores opened. I shaved with the blade that came with it and it worked great but I can&#x27;t wait to try the packet of different blades I got.</li>
    <li> This is a real quality razor. I like everything about it, from the heft, to the longer handle. I look forward to shaving now!&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised by its ability to shave in the hard to get to places better than even the smallest disposable razor.&lt;br /&gt;If your going to upgrade, spend a few extra bucks an get one of the best.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re going to ditch the cartridge razor ripoff do it right with this safety razor. The balance just feels right. Be prepared for a small learning curve as you discover the balance between a close shave and a blood letting. Go easy at first and you&#x27;ll be fine, let the weight of this razor do the work, it is balanced for a reason. I don&#x27;t have a particularly tough beard so the Derby blades worked well for me with this razor. Your mileage may vary.</li>
    <li> Was looking into shaving with a safety razor.  This razor is a good price and works well.  I additionally got some derby blades that work great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone retro.  Switched from traditional canned shave cream to brush and shaving soap.  Never regretted that change.  Now sticker shock on the current prices for triple edge disposable blades has driven me to go back to a traditional double edge safety razor.  Not regretting that change either.  I read many of the reviews on Amazon comparing safety razors.  It came down to either the Merkur or the Edwin Jagger.  I went ahead and bought the Edwin Jagger first because I was impressed with the craftsmanship.  As the reviews said, it is perfectly made and has a perfect highly polished chrome finish.  I was not disappointed with the workmanship.  I used it for about a week and was getting great shaves, however the razor seemed to be very heavy and the handle somewhat shorter than I found comfortable.  So I went ahead and bought a Merkur.  And for me, the Merkur wins.  It feels great in my hand.  The Merkur is not quite as pretty as the Edwin Jagger but is still very well made.  In comparing the two, The Merkur weighs in at 2.1oz/61grams to the Edwin Jagger&#x27;s 2.7oz/76grams.  The Merkur handle is about a quarter inch longer, and the diameter of the handle is noticeably smalller than on the Edwin Jagger.  So for me and my hand, the Merkur felt much better.  You won&#x27;t go wrong with either, both are very well made and you&#x27;ll get a great shave.  It all comes down to which one feels right in YOUR hand.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive excellent starting safety razor for me.  I did not experience the long learning curve.  It&#x27;s intuitive to use these things.  I have a mole on my face that I keep cutting, but not the razors fault.  Great weight, super easy to change blades</li>
    <li> Word of caution:  make sure the threads are tight each shave.  It can be jarred loose with use, and the resulting wound is gonna bleed for over an hour.  I love shaving with it, but it requires attention and care.</li>
    <li> Amazing. This razor has given me the best shaves of my life and has cut my shaving costs tremendously. Now I can afford to use a new razor every time I shave and I have more confidence and feel better since I get the best shaves of my life.  Yes I&#x27;ve cut myself with this but they&#x27;re micro cuts that I only notice because of the blood. I cut myself a lot less with this than I did with the plastic razors. It happens when I shave with cold water. If you use plenty of hot enough water to get your beard hot and the razor and shaving cream hot also, and you shave with the grain, then you won&#x27;t cut yourself.</li>
    <li> awsome product. Guard is a Must for this if not, you will learn it the hard way.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband a year and half ago. Its been a life changing purchase. We loved it so much that I bought another one for me, because I was going out of town. Well we where sharing one before I was just waiting for an excuse to buy another one.&lt;br /&gt;No rust, no problems at all.&lt;br /&gt;I have saved so much money. I can&#x27;t complain about this product at all.</li>
    <li> This is the second safety razor I have ever owned and this one is more true to its name. It cuts relatively safe compared to my first blade (an ambrosely) I like how it feels. You can&#x27;t expect the blade to do all the work though. You have to a wee bit of elbow grease. Not a perfect blade but great.</li>
    <li> I have the heavy duty version of this razor, but I bought 4 of these for groomsmen in my wedding. I like that they can easily be cleaned and do not tarnish and clog with hair like gilette razors.</li>
    <li> I love the shaving combination I have put together. I can now shave daily with a new blade without going broke on disposables. Initial cost for the handle and brush was under $45. Cost per shave with a new razor each day 30 cents. The process is very quick and it gives me personal time to plan on the day ahead. My sons age 9 and 2 like to use the brush to cream their faces on occasion. My wife has even started to use it for her legs! Talk about a win win. Her legs are silky smooth and we do not have to put out money on even more razors and canned cream. The resulting shave is closer with far less irritation than canned cream and disposables. Everyone in the family has come to love this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My shaving kit&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Razor:&lt;br /&gt;Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor&lt;br /&gt;B000NL0T1G&lt;br /&gt;$29.99&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brush:&lt;br /&gt;Perfecto 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush&lt;br /&gt;B00LDYFGFQ&lt;br /&gt;$12.95&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blades:&lt;br /&gt;Personna Double Edge Razor Blades, 100 Count&lt;br /&gt;B0077LAJT2&lt;br /&gt;$13.19&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cream:&lt;br /&gt;Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream Bowl, 5.3-Ounce&lt;br /&gt;B0007MW2ZW&lt;br /&gt;$17.17</li>
    <li> My first safety razor. I switched to these from a Mach3. This shaving system is amazing and I do not plan to switch back. They razor in and of itself is pretty solid. It feels right when you hold it. I have been using it for the past 2 years It still looks and feels new.&lt;br /&gt;The weight of the razor ensures the movements are smooth. It is very easy to maintain and helps you save a lot of money. It does have a learning period but you should be able to use it easily once you get a hang of it.&lt;br /&gt;I think these might last me a few more years before I think of changing them</li>
    <li> Quality product, very duarble, highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I really do not know why we ever moved away from these. A whole lot less irritating than a multiple blade disposable shaver. I will never go back to a disposable, wife loves it too, for her legs.</li>
    <li> This product works for it&#x27;s intended purpose. The problem was that it rusted. It was supposed to have a chrome finish. The product description did not mention that the area where the head meets the handle is not finished.</li>
    <li> The only thing I&#x27;m upset about is not finding this sooner.  Not difficult to use, cheaper, and gives a much better closer shave.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving since i was 11 years old and this is the best razor i have used in my life. All my &amp;#34;razor burn marks&amp;#34; disappeared.</li>
    <li> Good bye forever expensive 5 blades Fusion Power Glide.  A little Dove soap as my lather and $2 box of double side razor.  Been using this for about a year and half and have less irritation on  my skin and buying cartridges don&#x27;t make me go broke.  Clean with baby oil when changing the razors.</li>
    <li> Love this razor, the quality is outstanding. After a few months of use, its held up really well, and I&#x27;ve dropped it a few times.... No rusting (cant say the same for the stand I bought..) Easy to keep clean. Long handle is perfect.</li>
    <li> If you are considering getting started in wet shaving, make sure you invest in a quality razor. I&#x27;ve had mine for a little over a month now and I think it&#x27;s great. I had some doubts before I ordered mine though. I first started shaving fifty years ago with my Dad&#x27;s DE razor and still remember all the cuts and blood that flowed from my face. Honestly I&#x27;ve only nicked myself once since I got it and I&#x27;m sure that one was my fault. I would also advise you to get a sampler pack of blades to experiment with. Mine is on the way. It&#x27;s damn near impossible to find DE blades in any stores, so save yourself some gas money and time, and order it all from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Merkur makes a fine product and it should last for a lifetime if you take care of it. I love the long handle on the Model 180 too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using safety razors for some time now, and I like the longer handle. Great razor, for a decent price.</li>
    <li> First off, I was initially very skeptical of using a safety razor to shave since I&#x27;ve used an electric Phillips Norelco shaver since I was in the 8th grade and was scared of cutting myself, but my friend pushed me for weeks saying that an ol&#x27; fashioned safety razor will give you a better shave than any electric one. Eventually I gave in and he recommended I use this and buy a sample pack of razor blades. I must say that once i received the product I was impressed by how sleek the safety razor looked and it was a nice bonus to come with a Merkur blade. With a few weeks of practice I had the act of wet shaving down and only cut myself twice in the process, mainly because I was pressing so hard (which is what I did for my electric shaver). The results were a much closer shave than an electric shaver and a much more enjoyable experience to add to my morning routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I use C.O Bigelow shaving cream (great scent to wake you up) and will occasionally use the poraso aftershave (nice product to stop cuts from bleeding and smell nice, but not necessary). I also recommend using Feather razor blades for your safety razor as they give me 6 good shaves and glide along my face quite nicely. Additionally, I actually thought that the Merkur blades were weak in terms of shaving quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great Safety razor and I recommend you clean it once a week when you replace your blade by using a foam cleaning product like Scrubbing Bubbles.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t worry if this your first time using a double edge razor. This is currently my first double edge razor and it works really well. I have become proficient with this product after a lot of uses and you will too.</li>
    <li> I cant believe how well these work and how cheap the blades are. I love this product just for the fact that I will never have to be raped by expensive cartridge refills again.</li>
    <li> So far, the only nicks I&#x27;ve had are on my upper lip and chin (and those occur only when I go against the grain). The merkur blades this came with aren&#x27;t as good as the Feather Hi-Stainless platinum.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say if you go against the grain, this shaves extremely close. If with, it achieves a similar shave to that of safety razors.&lt;br /&gt;This will save money in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other things I bought include:&lt;br /&gt;Van Der Hagen Men&#x27;s Luxury, Shave Set&lt;br /&gt;Clubman Pinaud After Shave Lotion, 12.5 Ounce&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some tips:&lt;br /&gt;Hot shower before shaving - it really does help.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t pressure the blade. Do multiple passes if necessary&lt;br /&gt;Be careful when starting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest not getting:&lt;br /&gt;Merkur-Razor Double Edge Razor Blades&lt;br /&gt;and getting:&lt;br /&gt;20 Feather Razor Blades NEW Hi-stainless Double Edge</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* Creates no shave burns - no irritation on skin&lt;br /&gt;* Comfortable length and weight&lt;br /&gt;* Nice material and detailing&lt;br /&gt;* In long run cost effective&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;* Shaving will not be as quick as regular Gillette razors&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on my experience, I will never go back to multi-blade razors. Definitely will recommend the item.</li>
    <li> I been using this for about two months now. Definitely very clean shave and very smooth afterwards. Much better than the disposable razors I used to use. I have not switch the blade yet and not sure how long they last but so far its been excellent</li>
    <li> Good old fashion razor haven&#x27;t cut myself yet,a little on the heavy side but good. I wonder if I will have a problem traveling on a plane with it because of the razor?</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay but you have to unscrew it to change the blade, but it is well made.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend (along with the Escali brush &amp; Escali shaving stand.) He loves it! Says it&#x27;s a very close shave. The three pieces look very nice &amp; expensive together, too. Perfect V-day gift :-)</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for!!</li>
    <li> Worth every penny once I figured out the part near the handle containing the guard goes one way for shaving and flips the other way for storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are no instructions for assembly/disassembly included but that doesn&#x27;t detract from the baby smooth shave you get from this razor.</li>
    <li> This is the razor my son-in-law wanted and he is delighted with it.</li>
    <li> Outstanding shave.  Sensitive faces stay away from the Parker and go this model.</li>
    <li> Totally amazing razor;&lt;br /&gt;Super close shave - MUCH better than any plastic razors I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;And seemingly safer than any plastic razors as well, being that I&#x27;ve never nicked myself with it.&lt;br /&gt;Eco-sustainability is also A PLUS.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used disposable razors on my legs forever and never once felt satisified with my shaving experience. The last straw happened recently when Amazon sent me a few free schick quattro&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I gave them a try thinking hmmm, four blades must equal one good close shave but unfortunately for me four cheap blades equal lots of razor burn and hair clogging up the razor rendering them quickly useless because its nearly impossible picking the tiny hairs out from between all four blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I ordered this Merkur long handled razor after researching the reviews and I&#x27;m so happy that I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This razor has a beautiful chrome finish with a nice heavy feel to it. Its real quality and built for a lifetime of service. Its such an easy design and gives such a close shave that it makes me wonder how disposable razors were ever invented in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Unscrew the head, insert the blade then tighten the head. What could be any easier?! I purchased 60 merkur blades with this razor[[ASIN:B000NCMMBA Merkur Double Edge Safety Razor Blades- 3 Packs of 10 Blades - 30 Blades in Total- Made in Germany]] and it all takes up less room than a small pack of plastic disposable razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; My first shave with my new merkur felt silky smooth. The blade cuts my leg hair so easily with just one pass, it really speeds up the whole shaving process, just be careful and take your time to avoid injury.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I love this razor and the shave it provides! Its worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Wow! Love this razor I not only shave my face but also my head. When I first started had cheap DE razor. Now that I have this bad boy I will never look back.</li>
    <li> The best razor I&#x27;ve ever used!!!</li>
    <li> As a young person(22) who used both a electric razor and a cartridge razor since high school and always suffered from razor burn and breakout every time I shaved, this razor was just what I needed. I had researched single blade razors and they sounded great, but I was reluctant to buy one until a friend told me his was the best razor he had ever used. So I finally bought one and it has been great. No breakout, little to no razor burn, and the shave is better than any of the razors I had used previously. Lots of people are happy with the razors they have, but if you suffer from breakout or razor burn, I strongly suggest this razor.</li>
    <li> Great product easy to use with no trouble.</li>
    <li> This safety razor is wonderful.  a nice long handle (I have large hands) with a thick enough shaft for a good grip and no muscle cramping.  the rounded head and toothed inner-plate allowed intuitive angling when switching to the other side of the blade and they guide you towards a nice rhythm of shaving.  replacing blades is a breeze while the screw connection for the head is sturdy enough not to wobble or give while shaving.  little pressure is needed and the gap around the blade prevents hair from getting stuck or clinging when rinsing.      a side note on this type of blade- it is wonderful.  blows the mach-# and the like of semi-disposables out of the water.  economically much more affordable as replacement blades of good quality can be found for 1/10th of the price.  shave slow and with the grain, and remember to lather for a second pass if going against the grain.  I CONSTANTLY accrued razor burn using the mach 3, but this type of razor has removed 80% of the irritation in 2 weeks.  perfect for sensitive neck skin and to prevent ingrown hair.  slowly and smoothly is the key.</li>
    <li> These razors might not be quite as safe and work quite as well as the best gillette razors but they are very close and much more economical to replace blades</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re new to wet shaving, or just looking to change up your routine, then this is a great razor for you. The weight is good and the long handle makes it easier to work with. When I say long handle, its maybe 4 inches. So don&#x27;t think its a giant. Merkur makes great razors and you can&#x27;t beat the price. Replacement blades are dirt cheap and you&#x27;ll never go back to disposables again. You can literally shave for an entire year for under $10. That&#x27;s not even the cost for 2 of the leading disposable blades you&#x27;ll find out there. Just be careful and shave with caution and respect the blade. The razor provides little protection from the blades, but you&#x27;ll still find it difficult to cause any real harm. You&#x27;ll be a teenager again learning how to shave for the first time. Start off slow and in no time, you&#x27;ll be clean shaven in less than 5 minutes. If you liked this review, feel free to check out the reviews for the other shaving products I have tried. Questions are welcome and I will respond as soon as I can.</li>
    <li> I forgot to check if this was a butterfly opening and it was not .... the handle unscrews and the head has two parts. However, the quality is great and feels good in the hand. I used disposable razors before and this one is MUCH heavier. It is working for me</li>
    <li> This razor came with a razor, which was nice. I also couldn&#x27;t imagine getting a short handled one, that would be awful. Very easy to take apart and change blade, and the razor is MUCH easier to wash out than cartridges, which is refreshing. The closeness of the shave is unreal. I&#x27;ve gone through 10 shaves with this razor shaving long stubble and it is still clean with no razor burn or tugging. The angle of holding the razor is the most difficult part to get used to, but by no means a deal breaker.</li>
    <li> I had purchased these razors as a gift for my father, grandfather and father in law as a gift. Hands-down the best razor they have owned! Closest shaved and pennies on the dollar for the blades!! Well-balanced and the long handle is truly made for a man&#x27;s hands.</li>
    <li> best shave i&#x27;ve ever had, the razor is heavy and durable, it&#x27;s easy to clean, with one blade its no irritation and it&#x27;s one of the best razors out there.</li>
    <li> It takes a little getting used to, but once you learn how to use your DE razor, it&#x27;s the best shave you&#x27;ve ever had. I highly recommend this handle, and once you&#x27;ve bought it, taking it to your local barber (not a chain salon, but an actual barber. Yes, they still exist, and have longer, better training than your average cosmetologist, specializing in men&#x27;s hair and grooming) to figure it out. You won&#x27;t regret it and you&#x27;ll save money in the long run!</li>
    <li> Textured handle is nice, even when your hands are wet. The comb lets in just the right amount of soap for a nice, smooth shave.</li>
    <li> Very high quality razor, nice weight to handle. The price does seem a little high for a small piece of metal, but this item is still priced well in the DE razor market.</li>
    <li> Nice razor.  Has good weight and feel in my hand.  Use it daily since I got it.  I feel like a barber.</li>
    <li> I love this blade.  The included Merkur blade was a perfect fit that I liked, it was a hair bigger than other blades so I&#x27;m having a hard time finding a blade that fits just as well as the original Merkur blade did.</li>
    <li> Looking for quality from a by-gone era? The engineering in this shaving instrument is evident in its look and feel. I&#x27;m very impressed!</li>
    <li> I like this razor when my whiskers isn&#x27;t too heavy.just let the weight of the blade cut the hairs.I watched some videos on how to shave with a d.e. razor. Practice makes you get over your fear.I do get nicked once in awhile, but my face feels nice &amp; smooth and razor burn has nearly disappeared if your beard is heavy then check out Amazon.for a  heavier razor.</li>
    <li> I purchased it for my husband&#x27;s birthday and he loved it!!!!!! the razor is working really well and there are no tarnish marks so far. Its only been a few weeks of use.</li>
    <li> It brought back the smooth shave only a double edge razor can give. As with any product use common sense while handling and follow the directions on cleaning. Having used a double edge razor most of my life I&#x27;ve found none tha had the balance of the Merkur Model 180 long handled safety razor. The Crystal blades that came with the razor give as close a shave as any I&#x27;ve ever used. The product in its totality exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> Screw together design holds blades very securely and does not allow the angle to change. It is very solid and durable. No corrosion after ~ 8 months of use. Works well with Feather blades and Proraso tube shaving cream. Ditched the 5-blade monstrosities currently on sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Less chafing (fewer razor passes) with a sharper razor blade than with &amp;#34;modern&amp;#34; razors seen on TV ads.</li>
    <li> This was my first old school double edge (DE) safety razor.  It&#x27;s AMAZING. Even with the one Merkur blade it comes with you get very close and very nice shaves.  I went really old school and got a shave soap, badger brush and bowl to go with it which produces a very nice and slick surface for this razor to glide across. I used to get razor burn very easy with my mach 3 razor but after using this my skin felt so less irritated. If you&#x27;re worried about the learning curve for using a safety razor, it really isn&#x27;t dramatic. I felt comfortable using this after just a couple of shaves, it&#x27;s all a matter of getting used to holding it at the right angle.  The razor feels nice and solid in your hand and is really very nice and effective.  If you&#x27;re on the edge about switching to old school wet shaving, go for it. You won&#x27;t regret it!  Get a classic shave soap or shaving cream to go with it, they are so hydrating and feel so much better than the aerated stuff we&#x27;ve all been using for years.</li>
    <li> I started using a cheap plastic disposable DE razor to see if I&#x27;d like it.I had mixed results with the throw away, and had given up for a time, but decided to give it one more try with a quality razor. What a great decision it was to choose this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll admit, I actually ordered this one by mistake. I was looking for a clamshell type, and had this razor and a clamshell model in my cart. Late one night I decided it was time to order, but realized the next morning I had removed the wrong one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really doesn&#x27;t matter. The handle stays nice and right. The razor seems perfectly balanced and my goodness, does it shave nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very prone to razor burn. Especially on my neck.I have a heavy beard, and have had to shave regularly since JR High, though I do skip shaving on days when it is not absolutely necessary. With this razor, I caught myself shaving on days when it wasn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe in several years I&#x27;ll buy a top of the line model, but for now, this razor does the trick so well, I may not ever feel the need to \\&quot;upgrade\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> As a woman I&#x27;ve used a Gillette double edged safety razor my whole life. A few years ago my old razor bit the dust and I got another at a flea market. Well it just didn&#x27;t live up to my old one and let me tell you razor burn on the under arm area is no fun not to mention ankle and knee cuts. This razor is like absolute silk. It glides and gives me a close shave without any trouble what so ever. I just love it and would highly recommend it to man or woman!</li>
    <li> Wife  bought this for me a year ago.  I have to say this was a great gift and it will last a lifetime.</li>
    <li> I love this razor. It&#x27;s handle size is perfect. I holds the razor at the perfect angle and the blade never slips. I am a Barber and shave men with a straight razor daily and I still prefer my at home shave with the Merkur. Don&#x27;t think just buy it.</li>
    <li> I finally decided to go back to the proven reliability of the DE blade that I started shaving with 50+ years ago, It was like having an old friend come back to visit. As I shave both my face and my head a great shaver has been elusive over the years. If it was great on the face then it was less than on the head, and vice versa. Unlike multi-blade, lubricated, cartridge type shavers the DE and the Merkur require less pressure and a constant technique to achieve a great shave. The long-handled Merkur fits my hand. The Merkur blade is also good. BUT... not all blades are made the same way and sharpened to the same level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are new to DE shaving I would recommend a few things to make it both enjoyable and safer. First of all practice your technique for several days before attempting \\&quot;shower shaving\\&quot; without a mirror. Either that or stand by with toilet paper or bandaids. Secondly, start with cheaper blades ($$$ means sharper generally) and move up as you get better at shaving with the DE. (Sharper blades are usually better because they shave closer and last longer, too.) DO NOT apply as much pressure as you did with multi-blade shavers. DEs are not as forgiving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try different brands of blades for the reasons mentioned above. Keep your blades and shaver clean but do NOT wipe the blades off after using. (Wipes off the coating and leads to rusting.) Just rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, move your shaver to the top of the shower door or out in the open to dry after rinsing. You might also want to NOT crank the blade back down to tight while it is drying. Tighten it back down before shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy the experience and remember: \\&quot;There is nothing quite so rewarding as a close shave.\\&quot; (Old Army adage that has nothing to do with this topic, but seemed to fit.)</li>
    <li> Got it a month ago and I love it... High quality.  Shaves much closer than multiblades I&#x27;ve used for 45 years.  Watch YouTube videos for tips.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor based on reviews and quality. It came with one blade but no directions on how to get the razor open to install it. I was going to return it but before I did I twisted on each piece until something finally gave way. The handle unscrews from the head and then the head comes apart to install the blade. It makes cleaning the razor difficult to clean and presents a cutting hazard. Curious to see how long the blades will last.</li>
    <li> My nephew wanted one of these for his birthday. He loves it!!! Glad I took his advice. He loves the close shave that he gets!</li>
    <li> Great razor seems very durable and way more convenient than disposable razors, saves you a lot of money. You won&#x27;t regret your purchase.</li>
    <li> I HATE shaving.  If you have to shave this is the best method.  The replacement blades are incredibly cheap and the shave is closer than ANY 3, 4, or blade I have ever used.  If this is your first using this type of razor I suggest you watch a couple of Utube videos.</li>
    <li> I would buy this product again … Good quality... Very pleased!!!</li>
    <li> First shave with it today and very impressed.  Really got a close shave without any burn or knicks.  While a totally different feel from my G Fusions, I have to say that it was a rewarding experience to shave with a double edge for the first time in many, many years.  And the Merkur blade was impressive, too!  I have recently gone back to wet shaving and forgot what a pleasure it was.  I had also bought a Butterfly double edge razor that really was a chain saw compared to the Merkur........The Merkur blows right by it for close, comfy shaves.  I will be looking at more Merkur razors as time goes on.  Being retired and not facing a morning rush each day provides me the opportunity to spend a few more moments on something that I used to regard as a selfish pleasure.......the luxury of close, comfortable wet shave that I enjoy all day long!!</li>
    <li> Simply put no need to ever buy disposable razor blades.  I have been using my razor now for 31 yrs and just now using about the 20 th blade.  If you rinse (hot water) then thoroughly dry.  Your blades will last a long time.  Their only cutting hair, so unless your doing something wrong, they should last a blade a year or more.  Don&#x27;t waste money on shaving creams or fancy shaving soaps.  I learned earlier on Dove works great for shaving, ( but I wouldn&#x27;t use for a full body soap).  If you really want  your blades to last, keep a sheet of very fine grit sand paper.  Every month or two just give a single swipe across both sides of the blade, as flat as possible.  Doing this will take off the calcium build up you get from water, which is what causes the dulling of the blades.  I am still using the 32 pack of blades I got in the marine corps 31 yrs ago. Yes,  I have what you would call  thick facial hair.</li>
    <li> Its a Merkur... Does not need a review..  Quality Shaver.. They have been building Shavers to last a lifetime and this one is not different..</li>
    <li> Wow! This razor has everything you want in a great DE razor. The weight, texture, and build of a quality product. I was a bit skeptical at first as it seemed to be priced reasonably with favorable reviews. After testing it with a basic shave kit (brush/soap) I was hooked. The weight is perfect and it glides effortless over the skin. After a few short strokes, my stubble is gone and my face feels great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical as others have told me that this type would give me razor burn or knick up my face. After 2 weeks of use I have yet to knick or blemish myself, and my skin has yet to be irritated (and I have fairly irritable skin). This is a three piece that unscrews fromt he handle and breaks into the razor, guards, and handle. It also handles lather and whiskers well with the grooves on the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a superb first choice that far out performs the competition. The only drawback is the fairly pedestrian included blade which cuts a minimal amount on each pass.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll keep this short and sweet. I decided to try one of these old fashioned razors a couple of months ago because I get BAD razor burn from a traditional store bought cartridge razor. I use this razor only to do my neck and it gives me the closest shave imaginable while leaving me bump free. I use a regular razor to shape my beard because I don&#x27;t know how to use this for that yet, as it&#x27;s not easy to use for shaping. So far so good I highly recommend for a person who wants to escape razor burn!</li>
    <li> Takes some getting used to switching from the waste of money plastic razors but once you get the hang of this beauty you&#x27;ll fall in love!! Excellent design and craftsmanship. It will last a lifetime! Works amazing with the feather blades. I had been shaving with plastics my whole life till I just became fed up  throwing money away! I have a sandpaper beard and sensitive skin underneath so finding a perfect shave was really hard to do. This razor is amazing in every way possible. I&#x27;m 25 and have had mine for about two months now. One of the best investments I have made since I am the type of person who typically would get 5 o&#x27;clock shadow around 1 haha! Keeps my face smoother for longer and looking healthier than ever.</li>
    <li> safety is prioritized by product. build quality is insanely good.</li>
    <li> These razors are the Cadillac of de razors. You receive a good close shave. The design of the razor is well thought out.</li>
    <li> THE BLADE IS NOT WIDE ENOUGH , IT WILL NOT SHAVE TA ALL. SOME ONE SHOULD AT LEST TEST THEM.</li>
    <li> I shave head and face in the shower about three times a week. This razor works better than anything else I have ever&lt;br /&gt;tried. The razor is high quality stainless steel, I have paired it up with Astra razors also purchased on Amazon. The&lt;br /&gt;razors are good for about three shaves, which is about one a week for me, they cost about 11 cents each in the 100&lt;br /&gt;bulk pack, which translates into about $5-6 per year to shave! Also, many times after I finish shaving, I notice little spots&lt;br /&gt;that I miss, no problem, I just gently go back over the missed area after my skin has dried and can shave missed areas&lt;br /&gt;with no irritation. The key to this razor is applying gentle pressure and letting the blade do all the work. No more being&lt;br /&gt;ripped-off by those razor companies!</li>
    <li> Excellent quality and classic looking. Simple to use.  Makes shaving enjoyable. Better than any other razor I&#x27;ve used including electric shavers. It&#x27; great!</li>
    <li> I would recommend this Razor to the first time user of  a Safety Razor, works well and not a bad price.</li>
    <li> Great well made product.A++</li>
    <li> This is a great safety razor.  I have only used it 3 times but I absolutely love it and cant wait to shave again.  This thing just works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am new to safety razors and was worried that my face would look like Freddy Krueger got ahold of it.  No such thing.  My face feels silky smooth and I have yet to cut or nick myself.  What stands out to me is the weight of the Razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are thinking about using a Safety Razor I would highly recommend this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also purchased the following items to get me started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SimplyBeautiful Deluxe Chrome Shaving Bowl for Shaving Soap&lt;br /&gt;Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush&lt;br /&gt;Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream Bowl, 5.3-Ounce</li>
    <li> Best money I have ever spent!&lt;br /&gt;Just order extra blades when you order it, (comes with 1)and you&#x27;ll be set for a long time!&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe I spent so much $$$$$ on plastic razors. Double blade triple blade... Blah blah blah.&lt;br /&gt;Disposable razors are a complete waste of time &amp; energy.&lt;br /&gt;One good blade is all you need.&lt;br /&gt;I researched these razors, and this particular Merkur was the highest rated.</li>
    <li> Nice weight, nice texture, not slippery when wet.  Very satisfying shave.  Head snapped off after 5 months.</li>
    <li> Got tired of spending inordinate amount of money on disposable razor so was looking for something like this. Based on the reviews, it seemed like a good value and after about 6 month of use, I have to say that this is one of the best purchase I&#x27;ve ever made. This is a well-built product that doesn&#x27;t feel cheap. It feels heavy in your hand which is a good thing.  I never used a safety razor prior to this, so it definitely took some time to get proper technique down pat. First couple of times, had lots of cut, but razor had nothing to do with it. It was my inexperience that caused it. Along with the razor, I also brought 100 blades for about $5. Since I shave once a week, I&#x27;ve only gone thru about 6 razors so far. It&#x27;s going to be a long time before I buy any shaving supply besides the gel. I could not be happier with the product.</li>
    <li> used the complimentary blade.  It seems to be a well made safety razor.  It felt good and manageable in my hand.  Most importantly it gave me a good shave of one day&#x27;s growth after just washing my face with soap and hot water and using my preferred shaving cream.  I would say this is a good everyday use razor.  It would satisfy the shaving needs of 80 percent of the men  . . . don&#x27;t know about women.  If you&#x27;re a guy that wants to convert to safety razor shaving, I would strongly recommend this razor as a good one.  Finally about shaving products.  A lot of them are outrageously overpriced.  If you want to use a preshave cream, buy yourself a big tub of Noxema.  If you choose to use a preshave oil, buy yourself a big bottle of baby oil.  You&#x27;ll get the same results at a mere fraction of the cost.</li>
    <li> We had been using Gillette Mach III disposable razors at $15 for a 3 pack and it was getting pretty expensive considering my husband has very course whiskers and needs a new blade every 3-4 shaves.  We are soon to be full timer RV&#x27;ers and are always thinking and looking for ways to save money and be self sufficient (at least for a while:)  So after doing lots of research hubby chose this safety razor.  We also purchased the 100 count Double Edge Blades.  He was nervous about using this razor - afraid he&#x27;s cut himself because he&#x27;s used to the the Mack III and it is very safe.  After using the razor for a few weeks, he says it provides a very close and clean shave.  The safety ends of the razor head protect the face from nicks and the longer handle help gets in places that are hard to reach.  He said you have to be careful and not shave fast and be especially careful about shaving around your nose and of course your throat.  The best advise he has is DO NOT SHAVE FAST.  He uses a very slick shaving cream but has also tried a coconut oil cream, hair conditioner and kiss my face skin cream.  They all seem to work the same.  We will save a ton of money considering we were paying well over $700 a year for blades.  The 100 count razor blades that go with this razor last 3-4 shaves - same as the Mach III - but with 100 blades at $13 a pack, he has about 2 years of shaving for about $50.  Now that&#x27;s a savings!</li>
    <li> This thing is extremely well built and and nicely finished.  It has good weight and I haven&#x27;t looked like I got into a fight with a badger yet.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor in January of 2012 and used it often for two years.&lt;br /&gt;The last time I went to replace the blade, as I was tightening the handle, the internal screw that attaches to the head broke free and the razor head fell off.  I&#x27;m very displeased as I hoped this would last longer than 2 years.</li>
    <li> Maybe this is more a comment on the value of tried-and-true technologies than a review of the product itself. I&#x27;m 50 years old, and that&#x27;s long enough to have seen some good things replaced by cheap, disposable stuff that doesn&#x27;t raise the bar or improve the quality of life. I have seen enough plastic to last several lifetimes. And it seems that if something requires the slightest bit of skill or coordination to be used effectively and safely, it has to be pushed out of the marketplace by something a chimp could use without hurting himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enough philosophy. This product is pleasing in its simplicity. Form follows function. The heft, the machining, the finish - - it&#x27;s nice. I loaded the included Merkur blade and followed my usual routine, substituting the Merkur for my Atra. We won&#x27;t even talk about the electric shaver here. I&#x27;d never used a safety razor, and I&#x27;m a bleeder, so I watched a couple of videos about DE razor techniques. First shave, wonderfully close, no blood. Second, same thing. Third, I got a little too aggressive and shaved my neck too close - - needed some aloe to soothe the red patch, but, still, no blood. As the experienced folks say, the only force you need is what gravity supplies. Don&#x27;t press - - you don&#x27;t need to. Keep the handle-to-face angle consistent. Your touch should be light compared to what you&#x27;ve used before. Soap up and make a second pass if you wish. My beard isn&#x27;t coarse, so two passes is quite enough. One, done well, seems adequate for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try the DE experience, especially if you are a traditionalist who likes solutions that are elegant in a simple and minimalistic way. I am impressed. By the way, my wife said she saw the difference before she felt it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor on a friend&#x27;s recommendation and I have not been disappointed. The feel and weight of this razor is very comfortable to shave with. I am very glad I purchased the long-handle. It is easy to grip and comfortable to hold. While this is definitely a \\&quot;plain\\&quot; razor, it works well and seems to be well made. It holds blades tightly and securely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blades are fairly easy to change, but this should be done with care. I have a fairly tough beard and I found the Merkur blade that was included to not be sharp enough for me. The razor&#x27;s aggressiveness is just about right for my taste. I would recommend that the user&#x27;s beard and face be kept wet between passes to prevent razor drag. The top part of the razor is very smooth and glides over the moist face well; but if the lather is not moist this will cause the razor to drag on the skin. This is painless and I do not mean that the blade drags, but rather the razor head itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this razor to a novice user like myself and I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> A+ for both the Product &amp; Simply Beautiful, the company who sold the Merkur Double Blade Razor. My order arrived on schedule &amp; in excellent condition: Brand new box, shaver &amp; extra razor blades. Its my anniversary gift to my husband who knows exactly what he wanted &amp; wouldn&#x27;t hesistate to return any product that \\&quot;doesn&#x27;t cut it.\\&quot; He was very impress of my choice of Merkur since Simply Beautiful carries several diff styles. I bought the long handle because my husband has big hands. Perfect!</li>
    <li> Great product, so far.  It comes apart by unscrewing the handle from the head.  3 pieces total.  I replace the blade every week and clean the parts.  The top of the head gets scummy (from the shaving soap), but if you rub it with a cloth or paper towel, it brings back the shine.</li>
    <li> good basic razor, would like to upgrade to something a little heavier in the future but this is a great starting safety razor while learning to shave  old school style.....</li>
    <li> Great razor for the money switched from a terrible razor!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really glad I decided to stop spending so much on Gillette products and instead chose a safety razor. The Model 180 has given me the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had. Far less irritation and a much better shave overall.</li>
    <li> This is my first safety razor and I love how great of a shave I get now.</li>
    <li> This well built razor and seems like it is built to last.  It is nicely balanced and gives a nice close shave.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using a safety razor and what a experience! It&#x27;s really easy to use and I had absolutely no nicks or cuts on my legs or my under arms. I spent zero time getting used to it! I too have dropped it a couple of times in my porcelain tub and absolutely no dents or scratches on it.  I used a cream type shaving cream with it on legs and under arms an it worked fabulously!  I have always used disposable razors and have always had cuts and nicks every single time I shaved.  Also, my under arms would burn. Not so with this razor.  It was easy to place the razor and easy to clean after shaving too. Love it! I&#x27;ll never use a disposable again because of this good experience and it&#x27;s a little easier on the environment as a bonus!</li>
    <li> Long handle makes it easy to use. I would like the type that opens across the head for easier changing of blades though.</li>
    <li> You can stop searching. Buy this one. Easy to hold and has a nice finish. A razor is a razor but this clearly is quality.&lt;br /&gt;Update: I have received no less then 5 requests from this company wanting a good review, after I wrote the above. SPAMMERS!&lt;br /&gt;Today I just got 4 more review requests from this company! Ridiculous!! All delivered at the same time today.</li>
    <li> This is my first try at a safety razor after spending most of my young-adult life using disposable cartridge razors.  I&#x27;ve found that the safety razor is a bit slower (It takes 2-3 passes to shave as close as I would like) but much easier on my skin.  My face doesn&#x27;t feel ripped up after a shave the way it used to and I don&#x27;t get razorburn anymore!  I still occasionally nick myself down in the lower-neck area, but less than I used to with cartridge razors.  Love it.  I recommend it as long as you have a bit of extra time to spend shaving.</li>
    <li> I really can&#x27;t remember when the shift went from double edge razors to the multi blade, cost a bundle razor! I&#x27;m fifty seven years of age, and double edge razors were the norm. I thought that I would never experience that shave again. This razor is the closest thing to those razors of yester year! I&#x27;m also bald, so I use this razor to shave my sexy bald dome! What you get in this razor is a very close shave, that leaves my head smoothe as a babys&#x27; behind. I love this razor! As they use to say in the day &amp;#34;try it, you&#x27;ll like &amp;#34;</li>
    <li> It does holds the blade solidly, has a good finish, hasn&#x27;t broken, has a nice weight to it.&lt;br /&gt;Its a good handle.  I will buy this again if i ever need another handle</li>
    <li> PLEASE INVEST I SAVE SO SO SO MUCH MONEY VERY GOOD AND DURABLE TAKE PRACTICE TO USE JUST DONT USE PRESSURE AT FIRST WHEN USING THE FIRST TIME ADJUST BLADE AND PRACTICE ANGLE MY HUSBAND IS A PRO IN USING THIS TOOL NOW</li>
    <li> This is by far one of the better purchases I&#x27;ve made as far as having a quality product that I definitely gotten my moneys worth from AND has made shaving much less of a chore. I have some gnarly facial hair and this tames it quite nicely. And the shave lasts longer because of the quality of the shave. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it a couple times a week for nearly a year. Even dropped it on a concrete floor a couple times and it has held up well! No chipped spots or anything. Solid razor for sure.</li>
    <li> This was my first DE razor and I really like it, gives a close shave and is not to aggressive,love the long handle,would diffidently recommend.easy to clean and change blades.and the chrome is nice.would buy again.</li>
    <li> This is my first safety razor, and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;The shaving is much more better and I feel myself like a man, shawrng :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sits perfectly in the hand, easy to clean/replace the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kinda pricey, though</li>
    <li> Purchased this after a ton of research. Best thing I ever did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is extremely balanced, and made the change to double edge safety razors very easy. With the longer handle, it felt comfortable learning the technique easier, with experience from using new 5 blade razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heavier than I expected, but needed to produce excellent results without applying pressure and causing nicks and cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;New&amp;#34; style razors cannot produce the same results, even with their five blade systems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have considered trying DE blades, switch now. Your face will thank you.</li>
    <li> Great razor, nice heft in  your hand, easy to clean and maintain.  Works with any of the blades that I have tried.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t listen to the bad reviews. I saw someone actually give it a bad review because it was hard to change the blade when it&#x27;s only a few turns of the handle, if u have trouble with that most likely u can&#x27;t wipe your own ass. After buying this u will only need to buy the feather blades which r only $5 for 10 but u can find those for cheaper especially if u buy a larger quantity. It&#x27;s a better shave for a whole lot less money. Yeah u have to buy the handle but it&#x27;s only a one time purchase of $30 dollars and then it&#x27;s just the blades which as I already said r cheap. This is the first time I&#x27;ve owned one of these my only regret is not getting one sooner. One other thing as another reviewer described u may bleed a little on your first time using it because of it being a close shave, u already having razor bumps from other razors and not being used to it but don&#x27;t give up on it due to that it gets better the second time. That&#x27;s not saying u will but if u did. I definitely recommend this and I think I was a fool for not getting this sooner</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend. He loves it. He also loves not having to spend an arm and a leg to buy replacement blades - found them at the dollar store, 5 replacements for $1 - instead of 5 replacements for $20.</li>
    <li> I bought this (&amp;#34;long with guard&amp;#34; razor, there are three here) when I started shaving old-school. Specifically, I bought it because it has a long handle and I have big man-hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor fits fine in my hands and is not too long, either. The balance is still good and I have no problem maintaining the proper angle when I shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the one with the guard, but it does not look much different. Either way, I get a close enough shave. I have sensitive skin and it is not very smooth, so no razor will shave 100% of my beard, ever. Good thing my wife and I both like the stubbly look and feel.</li>
    <li> I have never before used a safety razor in the 23 years I been shaving till tonight I saw reviews on YouTube on how to use a safety razor and merkur safety razor was #1 recommend and merkur blades and I used it and didn&#x27;t cut myself at all! Best shave I ever had it takes some getting used to. I shaved a very thick 2 week old beard off in 2 passes very very close shave I recommend using brush on shaving soap ( better and cheaper than shaving cream) it&#x27;s what I will use from now on it cuts it doesn&#x27;t pull and cut like disposables done with me for 23 years!</li>
    <li> Heavy duty German made.  What Gillette use to be years ago.</li>
    <li> I love this razor. It is my first time using in comparison to the gillette mach 3.  I wont ever go back to gillette.  This gets the job done much better.  But truthfully shaving is still shaving, I hate having to do it but now in some weird way I do enjoy it more because of this razor.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re thinking about buying a &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; razor coming from China, DO NOT do it!  Spend the money and buy one of these, you&#x27;ll save money and a lot of your blood in the long run.  I made the mistake of buying a China special and looked like I was in a horror movie after attempting to shave with that POS razor, so I spent the money and got this razor, and LOVE IT!  I save money each month by not buying the multi blade razors that only last a couple shaves before the blade needs replaced.  I can get 5 blades for a dollar at Family Dollar and those last me a month.</li>
    <li> Absolutely no razor burn what so ever. I have not cut myself with this razor and this was my first double edge I&#x27;ve owned. Just have to be careful and take your time until you get the hang of it. Oh and by far the closest shave I have ever had!</li>
    <li> I returned mine. Instead of the head &amp;#34;blossoming&amp;#34; open for blade changes like my other good razors, this one has to have the head removed and disassembled into twp pieces and the blade removed. Then it all has to be reassembled with a new blade and screwed back onto the handle. Way too dangerous for daily use in a wet and soapy bathroom environment. Especially for a new teen shaver for whom this was to be a first razor. A minor problem is that the finish looks cheap. It&#x27;s chrome over brass instead of stainless steel and the chrome looks a bit too bright and cheesy. It has the appearance of a bad chrome job that will start peeling with time.</li>
    <li> Although this razor took some time to get used to it really does give a close shave. I also tried the idea of using conditioner on my face instead of shaving cream and that idea worked great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this razor twice and I&#x27;m very happy with it. I&#x27;m disappointed I didn&#x27;t try it before. I have large hands, but the handle is very sturdy and allows me to maneuver with ease. The clean-up is very easy. The blade that comes with it is okay, but I&#x27;m now using Feather Hi-Stainless Platinum Double Edge Razor Blades with the razor.</li>
    <li> I bought this with a Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush and Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand.  I am very happy with all three.  I&#x27;ve been shaving for nearly 30 years with over 4 years of whole head shaving.  This saves me a ton of money compared to what I was spending on Mach III razors.  The extremely cheap safety razors you buy for this last much longer.  I shave my whole head and face (except goatee) every 3-4 days and sometimes go a week or more between shaves.  If I went several days with the Mach III, I would go through at least two, but with the safety razors, one lasts me several shaves and gets the job done much better - even when I wait 5 or more days between shaves.</li>
    <li> I have used this razor once and I got a big irritation. Never coming back to this old style razors.</li>
    <li> I like it, I was expecting the top to open like a couple of doors by twisting from the bottom.  I used it for the first time this morning and it&#x27;s worth every bit of the price.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Easy switch from cartridge. Go slow. It could cut the bejesus out of you. Any cream is OK to usep</li>
    <li> I got this and the $2.50 Chinese knock off... of course this works well (it&#x27;s German so what do you expect)  I was surprised that the $2.50 Chinese version actually works BETTER than this much more expensive version</li>
    <li> This razor is fabulous!!!!!!  Very nice shave not to mention what you save on blades.  Buying this razor is a no brainer.</li>
    <li> slick handle when wet</li>
    <li> This is a very nice razor. The whole head comes off the handle and separates into two pieces to get the blade into it. I wish it opened up with a twist of the handle and just all stayed together. But I am very happy and the razor feels great when I am using it. I will not be looking to replace it for a long time. Thank you for such a great razor</li>
    <li> It does it&#x27;s job well. It was my first safety razor and it eased me in. I do wish that with my growth that I would have picked up an open comb razor. This one does not handle more than 5 days growth without having to apply pressure.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic razor!  Heavy-construction and easy to disassemble.  Will last for a generation.</li>
    <li> After using this razor, I will never return to the costly side of electric razors, expensive cartridges, and nasty \\&quot;goop\\&quot; shaving cream.  After pairing this with a nice shaving soap, brush, and aftershave, I have had the best shaves of my life.  I no longer have ingrown hairs, irritation, or breakouts like I used to.  You also have the added benefit of feeling like a man shaving!  As far cutting myself, I am 3 shaves in and haven&#x27;t cut myself yet.  Just remember to let the blade do the work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor feels substantial in your hand and provides a solid shave.  Easy to install the blade and clean it.  I would buy again in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> Unlike some the Merkur 1904, this one is made of aluminum.  That may not matter to you, but to me it feels light and cheap.  I returned it, and will buy another Merkur 1904 instead.</li>
    <li> long time straight shaver and decided to try out DE shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so pleased. this is my every day workhorse, great for a beginner as it isn&#x27;t very aggressive but tough enough to handle thick whiskers.</li>
    <li> I was very nervous about using a DE safety razor because I read so many reviews and discussions in online forums which said that they take getting used to and the first time you will probably hack up your face.  I have been using the popular 5 bladed cartridge razor, so this was a completely new experience.  I bought some shaving soap and a shaving brush from my local pharmacy, each very inexpensive and nothing fancy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t cut or knick myself once, it provided a very comparable shave to my traditional cartridge razor, and was very easy to use.  I am nothing less than thrilled with this purchase and will recommend it to everyone!  Ditch your cartridge razor and shaving gels/foams.  This set up is the way to go.  I will probably buy a better shaving brush at some point, but this was not a huge investment.  The razor, shave soap and brush added up to about the same as 8 cartridges.  Incredible price.  Outstanding quality.</li>
    <li> The only area where the $4 blades have the advantage is in the glide strips.  This like all safety razors seems to drag so I did some more research and the best solution seems to be Jack Black Beard Lube Conditioning shave which won &#x60;Best Shave Cream&#x27; in Men&#x27;s Health Magazine.  One of the reviewers said that it worked best if you applied regular shaving cream over it.  If you read the active ingredients, it seems to be the various oils in it.  At $33 per pint it&#x27;s expensive and it seemed like any vegetable oil would do the same thing so I tried about a tablespoon of light olive oil that the razor was soaking in anyway and applied it to my face with the shaving cream over it.  That worked and gave me the best shave yet.  Could something that simple not be common knowledge?  Maybe.  I shave in the shower but it might be messy at the sink.</li>
    <li> One of the best razor&#x27;s I&#x27;ve ever owned, I highly suggest buying it if you are thinking about it.  Only thing I can say that is remotely bad, is that it takes a bit of time to get a good, cut-free shave... but it is well worth the time and effort.</li>
    <li> Razor came exactly as described. Good weight and solid construction. Been using razor daily for over a month with no issues.</li>
    <li> Perfect size and length.  I am very glad that I chose this over the short handle.  I have a lot of control and it allows me to have a longer pivot point to better follow the curves on my face and neck.</li>
    <li> I had never used a safety razor prior to this one; after doing months of research i made the jump. The product itself is great, feels sturdy in the hand and has a good weight to it. Its super easy to clean and switching blades takes seconds. if you&#x27;ve used safety razor in the past and are just looking for a new one, i believe you would be very impressed with this product. My dad has been using safety razors for years now and he was very happy with his. However, if you have never used a safety razor in the past, you should be aware of the following even though this has nothing to do with the safety razor itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The blade makes or breaks your experience. If you got a thick beard or lots of facial hair, make sure you get the sharpest razors you can find (Feather Razor Blades worked for me). I used a Derby blades and it was the worst shave of my life, almost gave up on the safety razor before switching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Don&#x27;t expect to shave last min and run out. For better or worse, shaving with a safety razor takes longer. For me, this was great. It allowed me to slow down and enjoy a moment to myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, i am very happy with this buy. Even though ill be growing out my beard for the winter, i know i will never go back to those over priced razor at the pharmacy once im ready to shave again.</li>
    <li> My barber had initially recommended a safety razor to me after I complained about the cost and lousy shaving quality from the most common commercial razors.  When I used my last fancy triple blade razor, I decided to give this a go.  I&#x27;ll never look back now.  This razor is solid, feels great in the hand, and will probably last years if not longer.  I wasn&#x27;t to impressed with the razor that it came with, but purchased some Dorco ST300 blades from my barber, which are perfect.  Therefore, go talk to your barber or order some variety razor packs on-line.  Don&#x27;t write off the whole razor, because you didn&#x27;t experiment with blades.  There are some important tidbits, most of which have already been stated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Downside is that this thing doesn&#x27;t come with any instructions.  Sure, it&#x27;s a razor.  How hard can it be?  It&#x27;s not really hard, just different.&lt;br /&gt;2. Practice with it on your arm, just to get an idea.  This is a heavy razor, rely on the weight not the pressure you apply to get a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;3. Go with the grain first, against afterwards if you want a really close shove.  Never ever go sideways.  I haven&#x27;t personally tried this, but my local barber has warned me multiple times.&lt;br /&gt;4. Take your time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it now!  The savings greatly outweighs the initial cost in a matter of months.</li>
    <li> I wish I could adjust the blade depth, other than that, this razor works like a champ, and is the perfect size and weight!</li>
    <li> Husband only uses this to shave these days.  He doesn&#x27;t shave often, only about once a week and gets a smooth shave everytime.  the blades are easy to change in and out and the handle has a good weight to it.  It&#x27;s solid metal so it&#x27;s a good quality product.</li>
    <li> The Merkur razor is nicely made, the double edge razor blade by Merkur that comes with it is very nice, allows for a clean, close shave. You do have to be careful with it when shaving, it is not one of those disposable cartridge razors, so if your not used to shaving with an old fashioned razor, you should learn a thing or two before you start using this one. I have used it a few times already and the shave is really close and leaves your face feeling baby smooth and best of all, no razor burn. It is a good alternative to using store bought razors and does save you money in the long run. $35 for a razor that will last you quite a while is a lot better than spending $20-$30 on a Gilette or Shick razor that comes with 5 cartridges whose replacements cost another $12 to $25. I recommend you keep your razor dry after use, it comes apart very easily, just unscrew the handle, take off the cover and rinse all the pieces after shaving, dry them off and put it back together so it&#x27;s ready for the next time you shave. It honestly is a good investment and feels like it&#x27;s really well made. Like almost anything you buy, if you take care of it, it will last you a long time. I would recommend this razor to anyone who is tired of shelling out the money for all these disposable razors with 3-5 blades, that don&#x27;t get the job done as well as this double edged razor. Also, if your hesitant to try a straight razor, this is a good starting point to get the art of shaving down and improve your complexion by eliminating razor burn. If you buy this product, you won&#x27;t regret it. I do recommend you find replacement blades at a reasonable price however. The Merkur blades are bit on the expensive side, but luckily there are cheaper alternatives here on Amazon. Try a variety pack perhaps to get the feel for a good blade, and stick to the one you like the most.</li>
    <li> best thing i have ever bought.  never going back to 5 blade bs razors.  this provides a close comfortable shave no complaints.  seems like it will last a long time nice quality.</li>
    <li> Solid. Sturdy. I like the long handle because it&#x27;s made the transition to DE shaving easier for me, plus I can shave under my beard and see it in the mirror with ease. This is a very nice construction.</li>
    <li> Well built has some good weight to it, was easy to use and assemble. Not sure about the blade that came with it seemed a bit dull for shaving. Maybe order some different blades for it.</li>
    <li> The other reviews say it all. This is an amazing product. I highly recommend the product to anyone looking for a razor.</li>
    <li> As a new person to DE it&#x27;s a good first razor.  You can just see poor craftsmanship all over it - the cast is sloppy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does as advertised, but will be looking to upgrade soon.</li>
    <li> Nice little razor.  It&#x27;s not adjustable, but gets the job done.  Be selective on the blades you purchase.  I got tired of paying for all of those disposable razors.  This safety razor has saved me money.</li>
    <li> Rule #1... don&#x27;t be that *** that throws razors away in the trash... some things just need to be more carefully disposed of... razors, hypodermic needles, medications containing hormones... get rid of them safely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am totally sold on this razor... It is a closer more gentle shave if you take your time and use it the way its supposed to be used. You will get a closer shave with this than you can with normal razors because you have so much more control. The blades are dirt cheep, the razor is beautiful and seems to set the blade at just the right amount of tension (my grandfathers safety razor had adjustable tension but it caused more confusion than help. Its a breeze to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said... you need to be coordinated and patient in order to get a great result. If you have poor vision or coordination, or if you are not willing to pay close attention when your shaving, stick with Gillette. My Dad tried to use this thing and cut himself to bits, some people just don&#x27;t have enough manual control to make these work well.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful razor.  I&#x27;m not NEW to using a razor of this quality.  In fact, i hate all the electric razors because they pull your skin up and out, just like the commercials, and then your face is painful and the hair is basically torn from your face.  Let me Tell You why you should switch to this razor and to double edge razor blades.  1st.  The most important thing, I learned this from my father and I&#x27;m Surprised that NO ONE ELSE has SAID THIS!  DOUBLE YOUR RAZOR BLADES inside of the razor!  Using one razor is like getting a paper cut, the razor is too sleek to control.  You want to move the edge around and zip, you&#x27;re cut.  Double your razor and it DOUBLES THE STRENGTH!  You don&#x27;t EVER cut your face again!  Thats all you need to know.  So to share what I Bing C. Dionida has said, i want to give acknowledgment to my father for something so simple.  Bing I. Dionida, you&#x27;re the BEST!  Hope you all find this the most helpful reason to switching and staying with this Safety Razor.</li>
    <li> Best danged razor i&#x27;ve ever used. Period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best part is pulling the blades out and being able to travel with it in a carry on and just picking up some cheap blades at your destination. (Though the Merkur platinum coated do seem to work better for me.)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a long time Mach 3 Turbo user, but the cost of purchasing blade refills was pretty ridiculous.  You figure about 20 bucks for a month supply of blades, leads to a yearly cost of $240.00 just to get your shave on!  I did my homework on safety razors, and after looking through reviews on Amazon, I decided to give this razor a whirl.  I will say I cut myself a decent amount the first time I shaved with this razor, but that was because my technique was poor. The grip makes a huge difference on this razor, and literally just holding it with fingers, and not pressing it down on your face but just gliding it and letting the weight of the razor do the rest.  I can say I&#x27;m cutting myself far less now (still haven&#x27;t mastered the art), but I have noticed the shave is a lot closer and cleaner.  The coolest part of shaving with this razor is I actually enjoy shaving now!  It&#x27;s kind of fun using a shaving brush and shaving soap and shaving like they did back in the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The obvious financial benefit is you can get about 100 blades (Astra) for 11 bucks or so, and that will last you approximately 2 years (one blade a week).  So doing the math... Safety razor blades 11 bucks for 2 years, or 480 bucks for 2 years with a Mach 3?  That&#x27;s a no brainer.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband.  He didn&#x27;t like it as well as the cheaper razor.  I should have returned it, but didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality, traditional German suprior product.  Will save money over time plus a lot kinder than the plastic throw aways.</li>
    <li> The best safety razor I have used. Excellent quality and worth the price.</li>
    <li> Love this razor, nice handle that is long and easy to grip when wet. I read where some people could not figure out how to assemble this razor, you have to be a real moron to not figure this razor out as this razor is very easy to use. I am nearing 2 months and I still love this razor. Great close shave for pennies per shave.</li>
    <li> I really like it. It works great, only a few bleeders. I&#x27;d like to find one that had the gage on it to get that closer shave. It went from 1 - 10.</li>
    <li> The handle works great, but it is heavy compared to the light-weight disposables. The advantage is I have 100 double-edge blades for the approximate cost of one razor-refill package with disposable heads. It may take time, but I&#x27;ll get used to the weight.</li>
    <li> Been using Gillette for 15 years. This is by far a better, cleaner, smoother shave. 5 days bristles shave right off.</li>
    <li> This is a great shave! Love it!</li>
    <li> I hate shaving.  This razor makes this a rewarding chore rather than a punishment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simple, sturdy, stylish, the Merkur has a nice heft and good proportions for reaching every angle comfortably.  If you are like me, you had no idea how these razor&#x27;s worked:  you unscrew the handle from the &amp;#34;head&amp;#34; and insert a razor blade, then screw the two parts back together.  The razor comes with a starter blade but after that you can experiment with brands to find the one you like best.  This razor is so easy to keep clean and the blades are cheaper and a lot less wasteful than disposables.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving is s m o o t h.  I let my Merkur soak a minute in warm-hot water before I start shaving--being metal, the whole thing warms up which feels so nice.  I&#x27;m sad for myself that I spent so many years scraping the hair off my body when I could have been gliding the Merkur effortlessly along and getting a closer shave to boot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are afraid about cutting yourself---don&#x27;t be.  I haven&#x27;t had a single knick or cut.  Be careful, obviously, but I found after 2 extra-cautious shaves I had figured out how to relax and let the razor do the work.  Now, it is a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Ladies (or gents) I highly recommend you switch to a superior tool.  Thank you Merkur for enlightening me on the fine art of shaving.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor as my introduction to wet shaving.  Reading all the good reviews for both this razor and the EJ made choosing one as both get rave reviews.  Checking shaving forums didn&#x27;t help as both razors are great quality and value.  The Merkur 180/23c was my choice based on the increased handle length.  After ordering, I found that replacement handles are available and thought since the 180/23c uses the same head as others in the Merkur line, if nothing else I could replace the handle (and have my eye on a nice koa handle).  Some common complaints are that the stock handle is a bit thin for some.&lt;br /&gt;Once I received the razor and had it in my hand, it didn&#x27;t feel any skinnier than the disposables that I use.  I compared the two and the Merkur is a very little bit smaller (1/64&amp;#34; maybe?), however, it is quite a bit heavier.  It feels like steel, not hollow plastic.  It looks beautiful, not like cheap plastic.  I do hold this razor different than with my disposable but only because with the plastic razors one must apply pressure and with steel, the weight of the head provides cutting pressure.  Overall, it is very comfortable shaving with this razor.&lt;br /&gt;The shave itself is amazing.  I have never had (nor thought possible with my beard) such a close shave as with the Merkur 180/23c.  Now this is only after three shaves but I do not see any reason why this razor will not shave the same ten or twenty years from now.  Add in the ability to find a use a blade that works best for me makes this a definite keeper.&lt;br /&gt;Anybody worried that the handle may be too thin, there are quite a few aftermarket handles out there and vintage handles can also be found and should fit.&lt;br /&gt;This is a purchase that should last a lifetime, and then some.</li>
    <li> This was my first safety razor purchase and I am very pleased with it. The build quality is great and it fits my hands just perfectly. Overall very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> High quality well engineered instrument. A bargain at 30 bucks. Tough to top this German engineered shaving instrument. Well balanced long handle is perfect for me as I have a bigger hand with longer fingers.</li>
    <li> My first safety razor experience. I was surprised by how easy and comfortable my first shave was; and since I&#x27;ve gotten more experienced with the razor, my shaves have been getting better and better. I have yet to cut myself once, although I have never really had a problem cutting myself while shaving. I used to dread having to shave, especially if I had not shaved for a day or two prior, now I look forward to shaving every time!</li>
    <li> This is basically a fancy holder for a single super sharp blade. Shaving with this safety razor will not only save me money in the long run on razors/razor blades, but it will also prepare me for eventually shaving with a straight razor. The shaving technique is a little different, but the shave is excellent. A friend recommended I start using a safety razor; this is a  very well constructed safety razor and I am glad that I bought it. If you are looking to up your shaving game so to speak, this is a great place to start.</li>
    <li> Expensive but worth it.  Saving money on razors is easy with this thing.</li>
    <li> I have a friend that like to take souvenirs once in a while, and tonight is her time to shine in the spotlight. Received the Merkur today, broke it out and installed the blade. RTG. Miss Libra pops over to say hi, few hours later here I am looking forlornly at the empty space where the shaver was placed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, if it preforms like the other Merkurs I own it rocks. I&#x27;m going to call this purchase a prezzie since I didn&#x27;t use it...but I love the smooth skin so I&#x27;ll close this with that statement.</li>
    <li> This product arrived on time in the box as shown.  I bought this product for my fiance as his first DE razor and he loves it.  He says he will never go back.  I strongly recommend this seller and this product.</li>
    <li> Awesome- haven&#x27;t tried any other brands but 6+ years going strong. Simple and not a lot of moving parts.</li>
    <li> Looks and feels well made.  &amp;#34;Crafted&amp;#34; comes to mind.  Textured grip that makes it easy to handle even when wet.  Well balanced and weighty, but not too heavy.  Easy assembles and disassembles.  I have no complaints. I would recommend this razor to anyone interested.</li>
    <li> This is my first safety razor, and I really like it!  It&#x27;s really well made, and such a simple design that it will probably last forever.  I&#x27;ve been getting nice close shaves with it, and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband, but I have recently started using it for my legs and we are NEVER going back to disposable razors. The replacement blades are really inexpensive (way more so than disposable razors) and you get a much better shave.</li>
    <li> It feels nice in the hand and the handle is nice and long and it&#x27;s made to last.Get it now!</li>
    <li> I have a different model Merkur razor that is heavier and has a shorter handle. Unfortunately, it got knocked off the counter and the head broke upon collision with our tile floor. Fortunately, I now have a model that I like a lot better! The lighter weight and longer handle make it much more comfortable and easier to manage. I highly recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> no rust on it an i keep it in shower, have had it for 4 years.</li>
    <li> Since getting a new job that requires shaving everyday I decided to try something cheaper, and this safety razor is great.  I cut myself more than using a &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; 3 or 4 blade razor, but I think it has more to do with me still learning the correct ways to hold the razor.</li>
    <li> I have used this razor for a few months now and love it. It feels sturdy and solid, it&#x27;s easy to change the blades, and it offer a great close shave. I am very happy with this product and would recommend it to my friends. I have since bought a 1950&#x27;s Gillette Super-speed, and I really like the butterfly open it offer for replacing the blades. That is the only reason I gave a four star and not a five.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor for about 3 months now and would never go back to the Mach 3 I was using. It does take some time to get used to the process but it&#x27;s worth it. Even if this didn&#x27;t save money, I&#x27;d still go this route it&#x27;s that much better. I look forward to shaving the way you might look forward to a good shower after a good workout. I find that I take my time with the shave and it&#x27;s very relaxing. To really make this work for you watch some youtube videos on the best way to use this razor.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever done a wet shave and this was one of the top razors that people recommended. Well, I must say... this is the best razor that has ever shaved  my whiskers. This isn&#x27;t your normal Disposable razor that goes bad after 1 week of minimal use, this is a razor that cuts and slices the hair of your face like a hot knife to butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product to anyone that is thinking of starting to wet shave.</li>
    <li> WoW......this product is amazing. This is by far my greatest money saving product i purchased on amazon along with Derby Extra Double Edge Razor Blades, 100 Count</li>
    <li> i didn&#x27;t know too much about safety razors so i took a gamble relying on other customer feed back. i advise watching a video or two on youtube on how to use it but other than that it&#x27;s perfect. Its better than using disposable razors, i can tell you that much.</li>
    <li> Meets all my expectations.  Easy to use.  Easy to change out blades.  I doubt I will ever return to the expensive cartridge razors.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this razor because I&#x27;m tired of buying expensive cartridges for my old razor. I&#x27;m even more tired of the razor burn that I get if I have to shave just two days in a row. So I looked up some information online, and found that a double-edged safety razor was the way to go. I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks now, and I think I&#x27;m hooked. Some things I&#x27;ve learned:&lt;br /&gt;1) definitely check out some videos about how to use it. A safety razor works on the principle of the weight of the razor and the sharpness of the blade. If you try to use pressure like with your cartridge razor, you will cut youself.&lt;br /&gt;2) Not all blades are alike. I&#x27;ve used three different ones, and they all shaved differently. The sharper the blade, the more aggressive the shave. If you have a heavy beard, that&#x27;s great. If you have sensitive skin, it&#x27;s not. The best one I&#x27;ve found so far is the Gillette 7 O&#x27;Clock. I have a medium beard and sensitive skin, and so far it&#x27;s given me a smooth shave without cutting my face.&lt;br /&gt;3) Some people are shaving fanatics. I use my regular Nivea shaving gel, without the whole process of preparing my own soap. I also only do two passes--one with the grain and one against the grain. After the second pass I just clean up any leftovers with water and the residual soap.&lt;br /&gt;4) Most of us have problem spots on our faces where it is difficult to get a good shave. I&#x27;m still working on a couple of those, but I&#x27;m making progress. You may have to just keep trying in this matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given those observations, I have found the smoothest, closest shave I&#x27;ve ever experienced, with little to no razor burn (I do have a very sensitive face).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with the quality of the Merkur 180.  I don&#x27;t know why some have experienced problems with rust and chrome peeling.  The instructions do say to oil the bolt that screws into the handle.  I take that further and wipe the whole thing with a little mineral oil every time I change the blade.  So far it looks just like it did when I opened the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: After trying Merkur and Bic blades, I found the Merkur similar to the Gillette.  Since I&#x27;ve been doing this for three weeks, I decided to try out the Feather Blade I got in a sampler pack.  It&#x27;s definitely the sharpest blade I&#x27;ve used.  I will probably continue using it, because it gives the smoothest results.</li>
    <li> I was initially turned onto the idea of using a safety razor after reading about it on the website, The Art of Manliness.  Having tired of shelling out twenty bucks for a pack of crappy five-blade razor cartridges that left my neck feeling like it had been exposed to a gamma ray burst, I took the plunge and purchased the Merkur 180 Long-Handled Safety Razor.  If you&#x27;ve never used a safety razor before, you may be surprised at just how small most of them actually are.  They comfortably sit cupped in your hand while you&#x27;re shaving, giving you better control.  However, I read that the long-handled safety razor was much better for those with large hands (which I have) so I thought this razor would be perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a slight learning curve when beginning to use a safety razor, but don&#x27;t let that deter you.  It is not difficult in the least.  Do yourself a favor and check out some videos on YouTube of people demonstrating how to use this great tool.  I did just that, and had no trouble whatsoever adjusting to this razor the very first time I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, believe it or not, this item actually makes shaving somewhat enjoyable.  I&#x27;ve always been one to let my beard grow several days before finally becoming so itchy that I had to shave.  I hated it that much.  But with this razor, it actually feels as though you&#x27;re practicing a skill that you have acquired.  The weight is perfect, which is good because that is what does most of the cutting.  One doesn&#x27;t want to apply too much pressure when using a safety razor, so it&#x27;s necessary to have a properly weighted razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also incredibly easy to clean.  I usually clean it with warm soapy water and a toothbrush once a month to get the dried-up scum off of the metal.  It looks practically brand-new after a thorough cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is one of the best investments I&#x27;ve ever made.  Since purchasing this razor, I&#x27;ve spent virtually nothing on shaving products, with the exception of shaving cream.  Do yourself a favor and make the plunge into traditional wet shaving with this product.  You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> Great DE razor for my first time. Seems solid and wasn&#x27;t difficult to learn on. One note -- mine didn&#x27;t come with a free Merkur razor. Suspect is was removed by vendor :(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a brush and shaving soap for at least 5 years now, and recently decided to switch to a double-edge safety razor. Why? Tradition. Old school. Ecology. Economy. So I looked online and read reviews and tips on how to switch. I began shaving with my multi-blade razors in a way I was told would mimic these types of razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to find a genuine WWII era safety razor, but was unsuccessful, so I scouted Amazon, and ended up picking this razor. Solid construction, heavy weight, thick chrome, and tons of good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started with the Merkur DE blade that came with the razor and loved it. Shaved with that blade for over a week before my assortment pack of blades came from eBay (50 blades, 5 types, for around $10). I found one blade only gave me two not very good shaves. The second I&#x27;m still using after 4 days, and picking up more technique all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend that everyone consider a DE razor and blades for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. You&#x27;ll learn real shaving technique - this will enable you to get better shaves with any razor, instead of thinking, &amp;#34;bad shave - must be bad razor&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;2. You&#x27;ll consume less plastic, contribute less to global pollution.&lt;br /&gt;3. You&#x27;ll look like Humphrey Bogart or Cary Grant shaving old-school.&lt;br /&gt;4. You&#x27;ll learn that it&#x27;s better to learn to do things right than expect someone to invent a product allowing you to be lazy and dependent on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if you don&#x27;t change razors, change to a brush and shaving soap for these reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Cans of foam/gel only last a matter of weeks - a cake of shaving soap can last months, at usually half to two-thirds less $$$.&lt;br /&gt;2. Cans of foam/gel only get smeared on your face/beard - soap lather gets worked into your skin and really softens your beard.&lt;br /&gt;3. Soap is completely consumed and the soaps usually are shipped in recyclable boxes. Cans are under pressure and are a hazard at landfills.&lt;br /&gt;4. Whenyou are scraping your face and neck and sometimes gettint tiny nicks/cuts, do you want to have something on your counter with a rusty bottom? I never found a can of shaving foam/gel that didn&#x27;t rust on the bottom.</li>
    <li> I am so sad that I wasted 100&#x27;s of dollars on razors for the past 20 years when I could have gotten one of these. Just take your time and you will enjoy the results. Just picked up a pack of 10 blades for like a dollar. Try that with any other product.</li>
    <li> My Son and Husband both love these razors, they were using the expensive disposable razors that were costing way too much and they also left them razor burnt. These razors last a while, they are far less expensive and neither of them have had any razor burn.</li>
    <li> [insert generic sales pitch about glory&#x27;s of wet shaving yadda yadda price yadda yadda]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy the plating is good, not problem spots, figured out which blades I like and shave daily with it.&lt;br /&gt;I imagine if I clean it every blade change it ought to last me a lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;Big hands so I wen long handle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love! Shaving is no longer a chore, I GET to shave!&lt;br /&gt;I decided I&#x27;d had enough with razor irritation from the disposable multi-blade razors and the price of replacement blades was on my final nerve. It was either go with a DE razor or going sasquatch. I&#x27;m sure my hubby is glad I decided to go with a DE razor :)&lt;br /&gt;I like the long handle, which provides quite a bit of dexterity for manipulating around the ankle and knee. Its got a nice weight without being too heavy. Nice build quality, I can see this one lasting for years!&lt;br /&gt;Pair this with a quality shave cream or soap and there&#x27;s no comparison.&lt;br /&gt;After learning the differences, when our son gets to the proper age, we&#x27;re bypassing the POS disposable blades and getting him into a safety razor.....the differences are so profound!</li>
    <li> What else can I say. I purchased Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor to sue with the Astra Premium Platinum double Edge Safety Razor blades. IMO (in my opinion) they work great together. I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with Safety edge shaving so that being said, I love the weight of the Razor and the composition. I did get a few nicks to start but nothing major and no more than I would&#x27;ve with a double, triple, quadruple, ultra expensive blade. Shaving can be enjoyable. I never knew. I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
    <li> I shave with a razor only on Sunday evening to ready for the work week. During the week I use an electric shaver, mostly for speed and convenience. But I do look forward each week to that Sunday shave. I have always used disposables but they have become expensive and ridiculous with three, four, even five blades. What!!!??? Seriously there are some diminishing returns beyond two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So after a few decades of mediocre disposal Sunday shaves I decided it was time to shave like my dad did. I saw favorable reviews here so I took the plunge and wow what a great experience. Though I think the design could be more user friendly (you have to disassemble to load a blade) I love the end result. Close, easy to hold, great balance and weight. This is a really nice razor. I&#x27;ll never go back to disposables unless on travel. With 100 Astra blades costing only a dime each, this razor and Proraso shave cream it all is a wining combo.</li>
    <li> I am never, ever going back to conventional razors. Thanks to some reviews here and across the internet, I am not convinced this is THE BEST way to shave my legs! I got the long handled version, and compared to my boyfriends standard size razor, that was a good choice. It fits great in the hand (though sometimes it can feel slippery - be careful!) and the weight makes it easy to glide across my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a sampler pack of razor blades so I could figure out what works best. I think that - combined with getting used to how to use this thing - is really key to getting a good shave. Some of the blades I thought I would love, based on reviews I&#x27;ve read, did not work well for me at all. But thankfully I&#x27;ve found ones I do love. It took me about a month to get the hang of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Expect blood at first. Even if you take it slow and easy (please, take it slow and easy!) you will likely nick yourself. A lot. I&#x27;ve found SHORT strokes are best, not at all like shaving with a &amp;#34;regular razor&amp;#34;. I combine with a glycerin based moisturizing shave soap and shave brush. Sometimes I just use my shower soap and loofa if I&#x27;m doing a quick shave. I use coconut oil to moisturize afterwards. Usually I&#x27;ll soak in the tub for about 5 minutes before shaving. It does make it more time consuming, but it makes for a better shave and its a great excuse to relax in the tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only is this a cheaper way to save (after the initial investment) but I have to shave less often. I used to shave my legs daily in the summer, now I can go 2-3 days inbetween. My armpits were also daily and now 3 days! On top of that, WAY LESS irritation and fewer ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> Shipped and received quicker than expected.  I got tired of paying the ridiculous prices for cartridges so this razor will last forever.  If you get a trial pack of the DE razors of 100 blades, it should last you a year or more.  Then just pay $15.00 for a100 more blades and the razor will pay for itself.  I&#x27;d highly recommend the Art of Shaving Sandalwood Shaving CREAM not the soap!  Provides a GREAT lather with VERY MINIMAL cream.  Will last you forever.</li>
    <li> Having ample shaving technique down, there&#x27;s a clear difference between this and my Gillette Fusion. This gets a much better shave, yet contradictory to the Gillette ads this one blade has less friction. There&#x27;s a russian brand called Astra that makes blades for this, a 100 pack for $10 right here on amazon. At that rate, I won&#x27;t need to buy shaving supplies in the near future. Except shave cream, I&#x27;ll get the old-fashioned stuff soon. Want to know why your face burns after you shave? Check the ingredients in your shave cream, chance are you&#x27;ll find propane and/or butane</li>
    <li> This is the first safety razor I have ever used. I now wish I had never seen any other type of razor my entire life. Best shave in the world. Super smooth and very safe. After a few of the things I had read I was a bit worried, however it is simple. If you have any doubt go on youtube and watch a couple videos on how to use the safety razor.  I used the Proraso shaving cream in the green tube ,applied with a badger hair brush.&lt;br /&gt;D</li>
    <li> I got tired of using disposable razors and Mach 3s etc. because they cost too much, dull too quickly, cut me up, and leave my face stinging afterwards. So I looked around, found this one, and decided to give it a go. Best decision I ever made as far as grooming goes. Combined with a shaving brush and a nice shave soap, this razor gets me smooth quickly and painlessly. Shaving in the morning after a nice hot shower has become a pleasant ritual now instead of a painful necessity. The razor is heavy, chrome, and built to last. The Merkur blades are also excellent quality, but I usually get the Gillette ones from a local store (Most Meijer and Wal-Marts carry the replacement blades still) and they work fine as well. Probably save me thousands of dollars just on blades in the long run. Think about it. Why buy 3 cartridges for a Mach 3 or whatever for 12 bucks when you can buy 10 blades for 5 bucks and the plain old blades last longer and shave better? I&#x27;ll never use anything but a good old double edge safety razor again, just like my Dad used to use. (I guess the old man was onto something.) And I definitely recommend switching to a shave brush and a good shave soap too. It takes a little finesse to get the lather perfect, but it beats any shaving cream/gel by a long shot. Also of note, the \\&quot;long handle\\&quot; really is only about as long as a normal disposable razor, so keep that in mind if you&#x27;re looking at other double edge razors. And of course German attention to detail and quality is a desireable feature of this razor too.    Bottom line: Quality razor that should last a lifetime!</li>
    <li> well designed, well made, good heft.  The Merkur blade shaved smoothly with no nicks, replaced with Astra blades, also did well</li>
    <li> My son and I chose this razor because it seemed similar or better than the one advertised online in an &amp;#34;As Seen on TV&amp;#34; ad.  He told me it works great and he is really thrilled with the razor&#x27;s performance and especially with the savings as compared to other very expensive razors that have all the shaving blades.  I told my other son about this product and he said he had already ordered from Amazon, a similar one blade razor to the Merkur Model that was working exceptionally well but that he said the Merkur was even better than his because the handle was longer, making it easier to use.  I had originally ordered the  &amp;#34;As Seen on TV&amp;#34; razor at the insistence of my 1st son. The TV ad was very deceptive because they advertise $19.95 but by the time you get the razor (if you ever get it!) and pay for the extra blades which really are NOT free, the price is over $30!!  The TV order never came and there was no estimated delivery, and the tracking was non existent. So you will save yourself a lot of trouble and strife by ignoring the &amp;#34;AS onTV&amp;#34; product and ordering the Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor. It is a Great Product!</li>
    <li> Love this old school razor. Cuts thick beards like no disposable razor is able to do. If you have thick heavy facial hair, this is your razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a recent convert to old school shaving. This one was recommended to me because I have large hands. People also recommended the ones with the adjustments on them, but for the life of me, I can&#x27;t figure out why a tension adjustment is meaningful in shaving. I figure the tensioner was just early an 20th century marketing device to sell more expensive shavers, so I got this one instead. It is a  finely made tool, and it shaves as well as anything I&#x27;ve tried. I have a  thick beard with very coarse hairs, so have had all kinds of problems with razor burn (with cartridge razors) and ingrown hairs (the drawback of electric shavers, which eventually drove me to the old school). This and a shaving brush is the cure for what ailed me. It takes a bit more attention, but the effort is worth it. I don&#x27;t think it takes any longer than any other shaves. Certainly the results speak for themselves. As others point out, you do have to do a little research on how to use this kind of tool.</li>
    <li> Used it for the very first time this morning. I keep a beard, but i keep my cheeks and neck clean, as the beard is kept fairly close and doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;hang&amp;#34; over my jawline.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this in conjunction with a proper shave soap kit. What a difference. My go to razor was a fusion, but never again. And this is only after day 1.&lt;br /&gt;Prepare to spend more time shaving. Enjoy it.</li>
    <li> This is a very well built razor.  It is a solid cast razor with a fine finish.  the handle is just the right length and the razor is very well balanced in the hand.</li>
    <li> There is a reason multi-blade shavers have taken over the shaving market.  I bought this because I wrongly assumed because it was German made and much more expensive, that it was somehow better.  It is NOT!  If you want razor burn, cuts and a woefully unclose shave... buy it and weep.  It is also cheaply constructed and not a precision shaver worthy of the price.  DO NOT BUY!</li>
    <li> While this razor feels good, the weight and balance are excellent, I expected the butterfly type opening to insert the blade.  It is an annoyance to unscrew the handle from the head to change blades.  If I were to buy another one, I would insure it had the butterfly type opening mechanism, especially for the premium price.</li>
    <li> The weight is perfect and it delivers the type of shave it is intended to.  The weight allows you to slide over your face and not have to apply pressure as with most of the razors of today.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this. Little bit of learning curve to not nick yourself but he was tired of paying the high $ for today&#x27;s blades.</li>
    <li> It has a nice weight to it, and really gives you a nice shave, i would by one for a friend.</li>
    <li> -Solid metal construction and screws tight when blade is in    I&#x27;m still getting used to the double edge classic razor but it works very well</li>
    <li> great weight&lt;br /&gt;good grip&lt;br /&gt;great handle length&lt;br /&gt;very durable&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, first and last DE razor I&#x27;ll ever buy.</li>
    <li> Before I bought this handle I had never shaved with a safety razor before.  I had strictly been using Gillette mach series razors.  The handle has a very good grip and has a very nice touch to the hand and face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was terrified of getting cut the first time shaving with a safety razor, and this handle does the job of protecting you from getting cut.  However, I would probably buy a sampler pack of double edged razors (gillette, bic, merkur, blue bird, etc) because the merkur blade included with the handle seemed to get dull on the second day of shaving.  Also everybody has a different facial shape so it&#x27;s a good idea to experiment with a sample pack of double edged razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just want to add it will take a few more passes and a little more time to get a comparable shave to a Gillette Mach series razor.  It&#x27;s probably a good idea to invest in some proper shaving cream or soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this safety razor handle.</li>
    <li> Makes shaving enjoyable...I&#x27;m finished buying over priced shaving products.&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to shaving again...it came with one blade my dad shaved with&lt;br /&gt;a razor like this...nice and heavy (not plastic) protecting it in a small cup of&lt;br /&gt;baby oil between shaves...Cleaning first is part of the Shaving Zen Thank you!</li>
    <li> Good product - easy to use.  Very cheap for the quality.  Saves like $3.5 (not much but makes a difference) per week.  Just be slow when shaving or you&#x27;ll cut yourself since it&#x27;s got 1 blade (2 sides though).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a safety razor or full on straight razor for some time. Finally pulled the trigger to get the Merkur. Have to say it&#x27;s the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had. Made me realize all the razors these companies push with 3-5 blades are no where near as good. As for cutting myself, not once. The safety part basically doesn&#x27;t allow the user an angle that would hurt the skin. 5 stars. Probably have this thing for life.</li>
    <li> Great weight, works really well</li>
    <li> It says that this item comes with a long handle but the handle is rather short. It&#x27;s barely as long as the width of my hand.</li>
    <li> I bought this after some research on safety razors. Fairly seamless switch from decades of shaving with the latest mass market cartridge razors. I bought a second one as a gift.</li>
    <li> I used one of these 20 years ago and either broke it or lost it in a move.  Don&#x27;t ask me why but I didn&#x27;t replace it but I&#x27;d guess it&#x27;s because 20 years ago I only shaved once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After decades of spotty hair growth and painful shaves, I remembered that I loved this type of razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quick step back: maybe I&#x27;m too macho but I figured a bit of irritation while shaving was par for the course.  It&#x27;s really not.  Being satisfied with anything less than a perfect shave is also not ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After one more day of irritation, I decided to do the search for the perfect razor.  4 hours of googling with a budget, I settled on the Merkur.  Some of the reviews indicated shoddy construction but this is a cast piece that is sturdy and even hefty.  Initially, it even feels bulky but the curved design is well thought out.  After 1 or 2 shaves, it becomes an extension of your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t nicked myself and my OCD is satisfied with the perfect shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy I did myself and my wallet a favor by getting the Merkur.  There is a maintenance guide that you should read.  Blades aren&#x27;t too expensive and I change mine about 2 times a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shave on lads... shave on.</li>
    <li> This razor is actually better than described. I will never use another kind. For the purchase price of this razor, I could have only gotten a pack or two of the replacement blades for so called modern razors! Unbelievable quality, packaging, shipping, etc.</li>
    <li> Best razor I&#x27;ve ever used! Ever... this is coming from someone who&#x27;s used the fusion pro glide and disposable razor.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful razor! It is not very aggressive and has a generous guard on it, which means a gentle shave with less chance of cuts or irritation. Certainly a razor for both the experienced and beginner shaver. I recommend it highly. I&#x27;ve shaved head and face, and wifey has shaved legs, underarm, and bikini, no cuts for either of us. She loves it, she&#x27;s never going back to disposables.  It should handle any decent blade well. I&#x27;ve used Supermax and Supermax Blue, with Feather up next. The cost is a fraction of disposables and with plenty of lather and rinsing the shave is better than any disposable I&#x27;ve ever owned. We&#x27;re happy, and you deserve to be too!</li>
    <li> First time ever using a safety razor. Took a bit of practice but does the job great! I can get a smooth shave, but more importantly I&#x27;ve been breaking out less</li>
    <li> I shave daily for work and was looking for a way to spend less on razors. I bought this safety razor and it works great, and feels great.</li>
    <li> I decided to return to the old school style of shaving since I wasn&#x27;t very pleased with the amount of $ I was spending monthly on razors, plus i am military and required to shave EVERY day. The razor was versatile, well crafted of quality steel and a great price. The price for 5 razors at target are $3.50, the blades are well crafted( made in Deutschland of course!) and I couldn&#x27;t get a better shave. These razors actually shave you- new razor heads currently in the market pull and then cut the hairs on your beard leaving ingrown hairs, cuts and razor burn. I recommend using the weight of the head while shaving for momentum and always rinse it off in warm water and towel dry the razor . I highly recommend this product and its well worth its investment of $30! you wil save at least $200&#x3D; a years in newer style razor blades that just wear out and cost $17 for 5 blades.</li>
    <li> I had a long beard by my standards and I used this razor with the supplied blade, and surprisingly the results were better than the mach 4. I choose this type of set up to get away from having to pay 14+ dollars for replacement cartridges. I also bought the 100 count Persona double edge blades for 12 dollars, so I&#x27;m hopeful that I&#x27;ll be saving a little bit of cash down the line.</li>
    <li> To hell with constantly buying expensive tri-quad whatever head razors.  I purchased the Merkur Safety razors, blades, soap, and brush.  A year later I&#x27;m still using the same blades I purchased and saving a ton of money.  Nice weight in this Safety razor..  took a little bit to get use to but now I will never go back to buying disposable cartridges.</li>
    <li> I shave faster  and with the same level of safety with this sucker than those 5 bladed razors! And the razors that you can buy for the Merkur are dirt cheap! I bought the Personna Double Edge Razor blades.</li>
    <li> I agree with everyone when I say this is the right way to shave. I&#x27;ve been shaving my legs for years with the Venus razor and lately I&#x27;ve noticed it doesn&#x27;t feel like I shaved at all. They have really gone down hill. I know I haven&#x27;t had it long but this razor really is worth writing a review about. I got the one with the guard and I really like it, I think There would have been an even greater adjustment to face if I hadn&#x27;t gotten the guard. Obviously I&#x27;m not use to a razor like this so I&#x27;m getting quite a few Nickts which I believe others have said happened to them as well at first. So adjusting to the razor is really the biggest issue. I am starting to get use to it and I love it. My legs feel very smooth, much more so than with the Venus. It also feels better while I&#x27;m shaving, the Venus felt Like it dragged along the skin trying to butcher the hair. it never felt right. This razor is so smooth, I sometimes wonder if it&#x27;s still working. It just glides. One other thing I like is the fact that I get an extra day of smoothness before I have to shave again. With the Venus, it was sometimes every day I had to shave, this razor has been a real life saver.</li>
    <li> Will last forever. Nice quality. Fair price for how long Im going to have it.</li>
    <li> This is a 2nd razor I purchased to keep at a 2nd home.  Except for traveling I tossed my multi-blade disposables.</li>
    <li> This shaves wonderfully, and it is even easier to use than a disposable. I like to minimize time shaving, so I only do one pass and I shave dry. This razor gets everything on the first pass, and because it has a single blade, I don&#x27;t have to spend time rinsing hair from between the blades of a disposable. There was no learning curve whatsoever.</li>
    <li> Completely worth it, disposable razors are such a scourge to the environment and to your wallet. This is the proverbial Tesla to Gillette and Dollar Shave Club&#x27;s waste.</li>
    <li> This is my second double edge razor. My first one was a cheapo from Sally&#x27;s. Switching to this was like going from a Chevy to a BMW. The construction is solid. This gives a nice comforable shave without the irritation. Even a double edge rookie could use this one. The handle is more than sufficient for large hands. I will NEVER go back to 10 blades 20 dollar cartridges</li>
    <li> What I like about it: 1) Weight (real stainless steel), 2) shaves closer than anything except straight razor, 3) razors are incredibly cheap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like: 1) you have to completely disassemble it, in order to clean and dry it, especially if you live in a very humid climate, so the razor doesn&#x27;t rust before you&#x27;ve used it more than twice.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend wanted to start shaving with a double edge safety razor. I bought him several items to get started. This razor is beautiful, well-made, sturdy, and does a great job shaving! Such a great quality item. The handle is just the right length for someone who is used to using the modern plastic cartridge razors that are available everywhere. The blade that comes with this razor is a Merkur brand blade and it seems to be a great bade. As I said, my boyfriend is new to the world of DE shaving and he has had no trouble getting a close shave with this razor and the included blade. Some people say the blade is too rough, some say it isn&#x27;t sharp enough but I have seen this for every blade that has reviews here. I believe if someone takes their time and learns the basics of this method of shaving they will be very pleased with the results. He has only nicked himself once and it was a very small nick. He got three shaves out of the blade and could probably get another out of it but since the blades are so much less expensive he is comfortable just changing it. I see where the savings can definitely add up with this method. I asked him if he would go back to the cartridge razors if they were the same price per shave as the double edge blades and his answer was absolutely not! This is a better shave, a cheaper shave and the whole process is almost therapeutic he says. Not to mention there is a certain classiness and manliness that is achieved through double edge shaving. This razor is amazing! Learn about DE shaving, watch the Youtube how-to videos that are out there and buy this razor! You will not regret this purchase!</li>
    <li> I just started using a DE razor a few months ago after getting tired of the expensive cartridges. I started with the Microtouch One, and then moved up to this one. I suggest that anyone who is looking to convert to DE to start with a cheaper razor, in order to get a feel for it, and then upgrade when they get comfortable. There are plenty of cheap razors here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Right out of the box, you can tell the Merkur is of a higher quality. It has a good weight and feel to it, and is easy to control thanks to the grip on the handle. People may mention that it is hard to clean, as opposed to butterfly razors, due to the fact that you have to unscrew the head to get the blade out. However, with a little care, this really is no more difficult than any other razor out there. Blades fit nicely and evenly, and the razor itself looks almost like a centerpiece for your bathroom sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The Merkur blade that came with it did well on the first shave, however, on the second shave, there was a little tugging and pulling and a couple of minor nicks. Like many other customers, I recommend purchasing a blade sampler to see which blade works best for you. Out of the sampler I had purchased, I&#x27;ve used the Lord stainless steel blade, and it was exceptional. I did try the Dorco blades that came with the Microtouch One, and I am not a fan. Dorco is the same company that Dollar Shave Club uses, and much like their multi-bladed cartridges, their DE blades irritated my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  As a side note, shortly after I ordered my Merkur, my mother called me up to notify me that she had found an old razor that belonged to my late father. After inspecting it, and doing a little research, it&#x27;s a Gillette long handled super adjustable (aka the Black Beauty) from the 70s. It is a superb razor, and I suggest getting one online or at an antique shop. The one I have has a solid metal head, as opposed to the black plastic base plate that was introduced before Gillette discontinued them. Comparably, the Merkur long handle is right up there in quality and closeness of shave, and milder due to it being nonadjustable. I enjoy them both, and I like alternating between the two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Remember, all razors, blades, and face sensitivities are different, so have fun choosing your razor and experimenting with different blades.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say this has given me a better shave than the newer multiblade units, but it definitely does as well, and the blades are a hell of a lot cheaper.</li>
    <li> First time user with a safety razor, but I have really enjoyed the longer handle as I got comfortable using the blade.</li>
    <li> Wet-shaving is gaining in popularity and there is a good reason why - the experience is quite simply fantastic. If you&#x27;re thinking &amp;#34;Wet-shaving is hyped so much, will it really be as good as everyone says?&amp;#34;, the short answer is that it&#x27;s fantastic. Now, just to be clear, you don&#x27;t need a Safety Razor to wet-shave. All you need is a good shaving soap and a shaving brush - those are the essential elements of a wet-shave. What the safety razor brings to the table is a sharp blade at very low cost allowing you you use the blade only as long as it stays sharp - you discard it when you begin to think it&#x27;s wearing out rather than when it starts really cutting you up. How important is the sharpness? Ask any cook - the sharpest knife is also the safest knife to use. With a sharp blade, the blade rather than pressure does the cutting, resulting in (in my experience) practically no cuts, nicks or burn. Now, if you pay $10 to $25 for 100 blades, each blade works out to practically nothing allowing you to toss them after 4-6 shaves. To summarize, wet-shaving really is all that it&#x27;s cranked up to be and you really do want a safety razor if you want the best shave. Now onto the merkur....&lt;br /&gt;The Merkur comes in a small cardboard box with some cut-outs so you can see the razor gleaming inside. This thing is built like a brick - I can&#x27;t imagine it breaking under any reasonable circumstances. Given the simplicity of the razor, I can&#x27;t imagine anything going wrong with it either - this thing should last forever provided it doesn&#x27;t rust. I can&#x27;t say how immune it is to rusting but it is stainless steel so I&#x27;d imagine that as long as it&#x27;s shaken dry after use and stored in a relatively dry environment, it shouldn&#x27;t rust. So, take the plunge - try wet-shaving. Merkur supply a single bade with the razor so you may want to pick up a variety pack such as this - http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002Z85VJK/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1 so you can try  bunch of different blades before settling on a brand.</li>
    <li> well built&lt;br /&gt;simple&lt;br /&gt;cheap blades&lt;br /&gt;blades are sharp&lt;br /&gt;I was tired of spending too much money on disposable razors/cartridges. This a superior option, I like the way it shaves as well or better than others I have tried (many different major makes with 2 3 4 5 blades). As with your cartridge or disposable blades dry it when done (carefully) and set someplace it wont stay wet (don&#x27;t leave in shower or in a puddle next to the sink)</li>
    <li> Great purchase. I&#x27;ve owned several saftey razors in my time and this is by far the best. I have huge hands so long handle design is perfect. I use this for both my face and head. Dont search anymore... this is the one.</li>
    <li> First off, allow me to lay the groundwork. I&#x27;ve been shaving for ten years with cartridge razors. The last one I had was the Fusion Proglide Power, meaning it vibrates to \\&quot;...lift the hairs to allow for a closer shave...\\&quot;. I too fell to the assumption that the more blades it had, the closer the shave. What they didn&#x27;t tell me was I&#x27;d be shelling out mucho dinero for replacement cartridges. But I just assumed that it was the price of the fad. But I was tired of getting about 5 good shaves out of a $5.00 cartridge. Shaves six and beyond were sketchy and went downhill fast from there on.    I was on my trusty surfboard surfing the web one evening when I came across an old article (2008) titled \\&quot;How to Shave Like Your Grandpa\\&quot;. Intrigued, I read about the art of shaving with a double edge razor, lathering and the pure joy that one gets out of the experience...of shaving. I researched more and found that there is a second world in parallel to this one dedicated solely to the wet shave. I had to try it. In the course of my research I found that Merkur was a good bet for a solid razor. So I found this one on Amazon. To be clear, this is the Merkur 23C also known as the 180.    After collecting other necessities such as soap, blades, and other goodies, I gave myself the first test run with my new razor. I was literally holding my breath because I was afraid I would cut my face off. But I found that the heavy head and comb made for an excellent combination to slide across my lathered face. It felt natural in my hand and as long as I didn&#x27;t slide the razor perpendicular to my face, I had no fear of cutting myself. Clean up was a breeze as it comes apart in three pieces (not including the blade) and the entire thing is chromed very well. When fully assembled, nothing rattles or moves. The blade will not move until the entire thing is disassembled, which you should do after every shave. Mind you, even a \\&quot;dull\\&quot; razor is very sharp so BE CAREFUL!    Keep in mind that this isn&#x27;t like a cartridge razor you can speed through nor can you just ignore it when you&#x27;re done. You need to care for this product. As long as you keep it clean and dry when not using it and use quality blades (I used Astra Superior Platinum), this razor will outlive you and quite possibly human civilization as a whole. Double edge razors are cheap (I got 100 for about $10). Couple in a brush, soap and the razor itself, what you spend will be comparable to purchasing a new cartridge razor and a set of cartridges. In the long run, however, what you spend will pale in comparison what you&#x27;ll spend buying replacement cartridges. So be a real man (or woman) and come get the best shave of your life.</li>
    <li> This is a awesome razor. Quality is perfect with a  very close shave. One of the best out there for sure.</li>
    <li> Very sturdy. One note, you should make sure to shake it dry and maybe pat it dry, it will eventually get a little yellow, maybe rusty. This is very minor and even lazy attempts to keep it dry will probably prevent issue.</li>
    <li> Really nice DE razor!</li>
    <li> I bought this razor to step away from overpriced, nonsensical cartridge razors. The purchase was well worth it. Not only did it deliver the smoothest shave known to man, or woman, but it also didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend researching the use of DE razors before making this leap, but should you choose to step away from over priced, crappy, disposable products you won&#x27;t be sorry.&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to use. Hopefully this razor will last for years to come.&lt;br /&gt;And in case you were wondering... Sensitive areas were safely shaved as well.</li>
    <li> Awesome, I have been using for almost 9 months and have yet to experience razor burn, if you suffer from razor burn and are considering making the jump this is the product for you, I usually just shave my neck and line up the beard and this gives me that needed precision to look sharp</li>
    <li> Great razor.  Well balanced.</li>
    <li> I have to shave every few days. Previously, I used the Gillette 5 blade razors and though I could do no better. Turns out, I was wrong. The first blade cuts, the other 4 just tear at your flesh.&lt;br /&gt;Shaving is an event for me as I has stubborn facial hair. Few years ago, I switched to the safety razor and have never looked back. I use this with the Astra razor blades and I get a great, close shave that doesn&#x27;t give me any irritation.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s definitely interesting to use this type of razor. While I&#x27;m still getting used to it, it&#x27;s more work for sure.</li>
    <li> About 5 years ago I purchased a Merkur 43c mahagony razor.  It was awesome!  I loved it.  It was 90% as close of a shave as a mach 3, and one million times more comfortable, and one million times cheaper to use.  I was hooked.  Then one day I lost!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I ordered the chapter Merkur long handled razor.  It was crap.  No weight and was always missing hairs on my face.  I would say 1 out of ten hairs would just fold down and go under the blade.  So I started using my wifes cheap razor to finish the job.  Finally she got after me and I went looking for my old razor.  I then found a stainless 43c.  Although I liked the wood better this one cut just like my old razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;clif notes...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;crap: http://amzn.com/B000NL0T1G&lt;br /&gt;good: http://amzn.com/B004C6DTZ6</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t find the handle long enough. It&#x27;s certainly not as long as my current razors. At best it&#x27;s a mid-size handle.</li>
    <li> Everytime I use this I ask myself &amp;#34;Why have I been using Gillette mach 3&#x27;s my whole shaving life?&amp;#34; You probably will too.</li>
    <li> Extremely well made product, made of metal i love the twist on and off replacement pieces, shines great holds the blade perfect and balance everytime</li>
    <li> I decided to go back to Old School. Mug, Brush, etc. It had been since the 70&#x27;s for me. I had forgotten how satisfying a wet shave is.&lt;br /&gt;Old School is always good. I would recommend a Merkur to my grandsons. Very good product that is saving me a lot of money 😃</li>
    <li> This razor works great.  It allows for a close shave without the problems of chunks being taken out of your face.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have used safety razors as a youth, in the service, etc.  this is the only razor that I will use now.</li>
    <li> Love these razors. Only issue is more time consuming then a modern 3 blade razor.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Made in Germany out of quality steel. I love this razor, it is well balanced and a pleasure to shave with.</li>
    <li> I will use this for the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> I decided to buy a safety razor to save money on blades and I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 years now and I really like it. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> i was okay with the razor industry, for a while when they told me 2 or 3 blades was better, now they are up to five blades and they are just aluminum foil you can use only once, and then they are horrible. so back to basics. the weight of it is well balanced. i am a little pedantic. every time i use it, i disassemble it , wash with warm water, and wipe and dry the blade, which i can use every day for a month without change in comfort. i have taken shaving back from the marketing people who force us to buy inferior products by telling us it is somehow better. it isn&#x27;t. this is. i would give it 5 stars, but it is a razor</li>
    <li> I grew up using a safety razor, then wore a beard for 40 years. I&#x27;ve recently returned to shaving, and tried a modern multi-blade razor. The shave was ok, but all the blades seemed kind of silly. Then, my wife, Mary Lee, surprised me with the Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor, and I really enjoy shaving again. The razor has a great feel, and fits well in my hand. The shave is smooth. Over the years, I see the razor design has actually improved: the handle no longer twists to open the blade receptacle; the head is unscrewed to insert the blade. No breakable parts! This is a simple, reliable, beautiful razor, which I believe will last a lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;Karl N.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had a closer shave than with my Merkur!  Say goodbye to electric and the multi blade razors because these safety razors take the cake!!</li>
    <li> Was not a close shave. Had to re shave with my old razor.</li>
    <li> Saw the tv commercial that Rick Harrison the guy from pawn stars pitched,for one safety razor. So I bought it, but it keeps opening. So I went to Amazon and bought this Merkur  safety razor and the American made personna  razor blades,a pack of 100 for thirteen bucks. Man I will never buy another pack of those multi blade razor blades again. I actually look forward to shaving now. I guess sometimes the old way is the best way.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend absolutely loves this razor. He&#x27;s actually happy to shave now. He says the hair doesn&#x27;t get caught in the blade like the multiple blades he previously used. It gets a close cut, and his face is now baby soft. I think the best part is now I don&#x27;t notice any razor bumps or irritation he had before. The one I order for him on Christmas got lost during delivery and amazon refunded my money. We ordered again from his account, and if this handle ever fails us I know we&#x27;d replace it with the same one again.</li>
    <li> Too much of hassle , not shaving close enough.</li>
    <li> Buy one and your done.&lt;br /&gt;Great quality...great choices&lt;br /&gt;as to your needs.&lt;br /&gt;Now if i could just get a robot to do it for me&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otha</li>
    <li> Summary: This Merkur razor, in combination with blades from Feather, provides an excellent, nick-free shave even for beginners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Details:&lt;br /&gt;I think a lot of the forums discussing razors, shaving, etc., could be simplified by just recommending the combination of Merkur and Feather for most people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After considering the ongoing, never-ending, increasing expense of using disposable razors, and wanting a more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; approach to shaving, I did some research (including at The Wirecutter, which has an excellent article on the best razors) and soon settled on this product, the Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor. For blades, I choose platinum-coated blades from Feather in Japan. I chose this \\&quot;long-handled model\\&quot; thinking the handle would actually be longer than it is. Truly, it feels a bit short to me, and my hands are not large at all, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the regular, non-long handled version for most people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received the razor and blades, I was excited but a bit anxious to try it out: I was worried I would cut up my face. So I read some tips online and watched a video or two on YouTube. All you really need to know:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Use *a lot* of warm water on your face&lt;br /&gt;- Work up a good lather of shaving cream and apply generously (I use Dr Bronner&#x27;s all-natural, but most non-alcohol/non-aerosol-based creams should work)&lt;br /&gt;- Hold the razor so the blade is at about a 30-degree angle relative to your face.&lt;br /&gt;- Go slowly. If you&#x27;ve only ever used disposables (like me) you may have a tendency to rush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my best results, I go with the grain at first, then against the grain for a close finish. Your experience may vary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first shave, I moved slowly and was very patient. My only nicks were from shaving over a couple of pre-existing razor bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My second shave, I moved a little faster but tried to maintain patience. No nicks at all! I was feeling confident. I noticed my few razor bumps disappearing. That shows the blade agrees with my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my third shave, I decided to take a risk: I shaved my head in the shower, with no mirror. No nicks! (I&#x27;ve been using disposables to do that for almost 20 years, but I was surprised that I had no trouble making the adjustment. I don&#x27;t consider myself a particularly dextrous person.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve shaved a few more times since then and couldn&#x27;t be happier. Today, I used the Merkur blade that came with the razor. Not quite as friction-free as the Feather blades, but still fine. (I have medium-to-light stubble.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think people may run into trouble with safety razors like this one because they hurry or press down too much. If you have a light touch and \\&quot;let the razor do the work\\&quot; as many advise, you should be fine after a little practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can buy 10 Feather blades for around $4.50. Compare that to the cost of disposables like Mach 3, which nowadays are $14 or more for a pack. Long term savings, a very clean shave, and a more natural feel. I&#x27;m very glad I made the shift from disposables to a safety razor and recommend the same to others.</li>
    <li> I was given a Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor, Astra Superior Platinum blades, Proraso shaving soap, and Crew shaving oil as a gift from my girlfriend&#x27;s son who swore by the whole ritual experience of using this razor after prepping the face with hot towel, shaving oil, and soaping with a brush. It seemed like a lot of work and time, but I&#x27;m now a believer. I think it takes me about the same amount of time because I have to stroke my face about a third as much with this razor and blade combination vs the twin-blade disposables I had been using for years. I have yet to even knick, much less, cut myself, and the shave is incredible - lasts much longer. I formerly shaved in the shower, but now I go through &amp;#34;The Ritual&amp;#34; at the sink. It&#x27;s satisfying both because of the results and the fascination my girlfriend has with watching me use this beautiful implement. I highly recommend this razor and ritual to all my friends.</li>
    <li> I was a little nervous going to a safety razor for shaving, but I am so happy I made the switch.  It is easy to keep clean and am happy with the shave that I get from this, seems faster than a 4-5 blade disposable.</li>
    <li> My husband really like this razor, he said it shaves really well. His face is very smooth afterwards. Looks nice too. He mentioned it was a good staring razor to learn on before moving on the a straight razor.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy shaving with this razor. It is very well made. You will get a close and clean shave with this razor...</li>
    <li> I am brand new to this whole wet shaving thing, so I bought this razor based on previous reviews. I am very glad I bought this one, as it made the transition from cartridge razor shaving to wet shaving fairly easy. German made razor feels really tough and well made. Pretty easy to change out blades, although does not look as easy as the &amp;#34;butterfly&amp;#34; opening razor. I hope this lasts a long time, because I really enjoy shaving now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always felt my disposable razors were needlessly expensive, so I was delighted when I saw a TV ad for a similar product.  I assumed the safety razor had gone the way of rotary dial phones, etc.  Well, a little searching told me there was a lot of negative feedback for the particular item I saw on TV.  Then, I found this German-made product and ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels different than a disposable. It&#x27;s heavier and it&#x27;s top-heavy.  And, I never used a safety razor before, so I was a little worried about cutting myself.  I was somewhat undecided after the first shave.  However, after a week of use it feels &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; in my hand and I&#x27;m getting a smooth shave, same as the disposable.  Having one blade instead of multiple blades isn&#x27;t an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cool part is the holder can be loosened which allows you to clean the blade under the faucet.  I&#x27;m getting several shaves out of each blade this way whereas I got only one with the gunked-up disposable.  Now I smile when I walk down the shaving isle at the drug store because I don&#x27;t have to waste money on disposables anymore.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving with Mach 3 for past 12 years, after using this today I can say that I&#x27;m not going back. The made quality is top notch.</li>
    <li> A month into owning this and I would recommend to anyone. High quality and easy to use. This was my first safety razor and it the best shave of my life. Don&#x27;t listen to those saying that you&#x27;ll slice your face up. Watch a couple videos about how to use it and go slow until you get the hand of it and you&#x27;ll be fine. Wish I would have made the switch to a safety razor years ago.</li>
    <li> The product came as described. The Razor is well made all the parts are well made and highly polished. The razor should last forever due to its simple construction.</li>
    <li> This is my first safety razor. I received it a week ago. I have now shaved enough times to get the hang of how to hold it to get all the surfaces of my face. I had been using the Mach 2 since it came out and my wife had found blades at a 99 cent store making it really affordable. However, the shave was adequate, with the safety razor and the 7am platinum blades, whew, close is not the word. I found my old face as smooth as a baby&#x27;s behind. I am quite pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a quick note, when I have to clean an old razor from built up shaving cream and water stains, the easiest way is to use an old brush head from my electric toothbrush. A couple of seconds under running water and it is like new. I use it on my ring and my wife&#x27;s ring, diamonds sparkle like new again.</li>
    <li> This was a gift to my brother and he loves it. He likes the weight of it in his hand. He said it is more substantial than other razors he&#x27;s tried. He would recommend it although using a straight razor takes a little practice.</li>
    <li> I love this little guy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its the perfect balance between quality, speed and that hands on experience of traditional wet shaving creates. I tried out a regular straight edge razor but kept having problems shaving a few angles and kept getting nicked, but the quality of the shave was hard to beat. I decided to give this a go and found that it was the perfect solution. Its not as close as a straight edge but its pretty close.</li>
    <li> as someone who has used the disposable multi-bladed razors, or had the expensive to replace cartridge razors, this was a great purchase hands down..... I have never had a better shave (other than from a professional with a straight razor).... I don&#x27;t know why I even used the multi bladed razors...other than when I did start shaving way back in my younger years all that was available were the multi bladed razors......&lt;br /&gt;I like the long handle razor as it fits my gorilla size hands, and it feels weighty enough....you can&#x27;t go wrong purchasing this one...you will save $$$ over the disposable cartridges.....</li>
    <li> This razor does exactly what it advertises. The shave is pretty close and it is very easy to maintain. I am trying different blades to find my perfect fit but so far the razor has performed well with all of them. Highly suggested razor for a 1st time wet shaving enthusiast.</li>
    <li> Got it in good time! Came with razor, nice shave great product, great feel</li>
    <li> I have been using a brush and mug for decades. In searching out a replacement brush on Amazon I ended up branching out to information/product reviews on this safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;I shaved for years with an injector razor and switched to the multiple blade set-up when blades for my old razor became unavailable. Planned obsolescence happened again when it became impossible to find replacement cartridges for my double blade razor. I gave up and went the disposable route.&lt;br /&gt;I remember back to my college days in the early 1970&#x27;s reading an article on the &amp;#34;new trac two blade&amp;#34;  in a marketing magazine. This article explained how the multiple blade set up was just a gimmick to increase the cost per unit to inflate profit.&lt;br /&gt;The outrageous cost of multi-blade razors and cartridges today forced me to experiment with an &amp;#34;old tech&amp;#34; safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this razor for a month now with not one nick. For the record I use Crystal &amp;#34;SUPER +&amp;#34; Stainless Steel Platinum Coated Double Edge Safety Razor Blades which has great ratings. There are some fantastic write ups here along with videos with detailed safety razor shaving instructions. I found these to be very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;I kick myself now thinking how much money I literally threw away using overpriced multi blade razors. The Merkur is the real thing: save yourself some money!&lt;br /&gt;As an added note... if you are a father to a son who is going through that awkward stage with the first appearances of facial hair, a lesson to your son in how to use a razor, brush,and mug could be a real bonding experience.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor for a closer shave.  I had a similar one back in the 80&#x27;s when I was 20 something my dad gave to me.  Beware, go slow and be careful or you can slice off a chunk of skin.  That&#x27;s why I got rid of my old one.  For a close save you can&#x27;t beat it. BE CAREFUL</li>
    <li> This is my first safety razor.  I love it!  It is easy to use, and has been a great starter.  I was a little nervous about slicing my face into pieces, but Merkur made this long handled razor for guys like me.  The razor has a nice weight to it, and is really easy to keep clean.  I will eventually upgrade to a different razor.  Merkur will be my choice!</li>
    <li> After 15 years of a full beard I decided to change things up a bit; I also decided that if shaving was going to be part of my daily routine I would do it right. This razor is definitely part of my doing it right. In fact I look forward to the shave as part of getting my day started.</li>
    <li> Overall workmanship is excellent. The three individual parts are well made, and I can&#x27;t find any unintentional sharp edges or other manufacturing flaws. The handle screws into the head easily, and holds together nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the tail end of the handle steps out at a sharp angle and can easily catch on my razor stand, sending it toppling. The morning, the razor caught on the stand and fell out of my hand. Fortunately, it landed on my counter and stopped. A few more inches and I might have a nice large gash in my foot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be shopping for a new razor stand soon.</li>
    <li> just use my new safety razor and like the shave, i will not go back to the other razor again</li>
    <li> Ive only shaved with this a few times, so I can&#x27;t speak to the longevity of this product, but it seems to be sturdy. For a first time saftey razor user it seems that this was a good product to start with. I have given myself a couple knicks, but that is to be expected. The merkur blade that comes with it seemed good until I put a feather blade in it, then it was like wiping hair off of my face rather than cutting it off. If you&#x27;re buying this razor as your first saftey razor, buy yourself a variety pack of blades to see what works best for you and you wont be disapointed.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Merkur 180 Long for a couple months now and I can say with certainty that I will never go back to my old Mach 5. I was a little over confident at first and had a few nicks, but after a few shaves I got it down. Just take it slow and don&#x27;t apply extra pressure and you will get an amazing shave.</li>
    <li> I have never had a shave closer than I have had with this razor. It is amazing, really really relaxing to shave, and I actually dont shave for 2 days on purpose because I just love the smooth feel of clean shavin this razor gives me. It is awesome. So much better than conventional razors and electric ones as well.</li>
    <li> I have been very pleased with this safety razor as it is my very first to own. I have yet to nick or cut myself. Never going back to multiblade overpriced razors.</li>
    <li> This is my first wet shave razor, and it works really well. I had a steep learning curve to use it, but so far I&#x27;m very satisfied. As it is my first, I don&#x27;t know the market, so I don&#x27;t have anything else to compare it to.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my husband for valentines day. He loves it. He is also checking out different brand of blades. So far he has been able to shave twice a week and that is a huge deal. little to no razor burn and only cut himself once. so far so good.</li>
    <li> Excellent product that produces a great shave!  Takes some practice to get used to, but is worth it.  Together with shaving brush, soap, and bowl it makes a great shaving experience.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m free of the Gillette stronghold forever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shave my head and face 2-3 times per week. I had typically gone through 4 Proglide carts per month. That&#x27;s about $15/mo. I got this razor and some Feather blades and never looked back. I got a 100pk of Astra SP blades and they work great.  That&#x27;s 100 razor blades for $12 people...12 cents each! Even with throwing each blade away after every use I went from $15/mo to $1.44/mo in blades. Let&#x27;s round to $1.50...that&#x27;s a savings of $13.50/mo or $162 per year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, keep that in mind when you buy this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every time I had to buy more Gillette carts I looked at this razor. However, I always hesitated because I thought I wouldn&#x27;t be able to use the double edged razor system comfortably. I was concerned about getting a lot of cuts and not having enough patience for the double edged razor system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those concerns were completely unfounded! I have somewhat sensitive skin. I have only had one tiny cut in about 15 shaves and that was in the crook of my ear when i was shaving my head at an awkward angle. I shave just as quickly with my 180 as I did with the Proglide! What is critical is the shaving preparation. Simply, let your face soak in warm to hot water as long as you can prior to shaving. I have used Proraso soap, Aveeno gel and Nivea gel all with equally good results. I have used Feather blades (which are supposed to be the sharpest) to start out and Astra SP blades both with great success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to good preparation, (the same should be applicable for cartridge shaving anyway) it is important *NOT* to use too much manual pressure with this or any double edged razor. You CANNOT use this just like your Proglide/Mach3/Fusion system! You simply need to trust that the sharp blade will do it&#x27;s job rather than your pressure. Use MORE passes rather than more pressure. Keep your face well lathered. Rinse the razor often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be patient the first few time you use the razor. Each time you feel yourself applying more pressure remind yourself of how sharp the blade is. You do need to relearn how to shave if you (like me) have always used a cartridge system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another tip: After using warm to hot water while shaving, after you are done rinse with COLD water. It will help the pores close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not get razor burn, nicks, cuts, or facial irritation in any way from the 180 plus Astra SP or Feather blades. I find the weight and grip of this razor to be excellent. I think you will love it as long as you allow time to adapt.  Good luck!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a well made razor but the old fashioned d.e.blades don&#x27;t work any better than a bic disposable. Modern razors with two or more blades seem to work best for me. Kind of a shame too; I was diggin&#x27; the whole retro shave thing.</li>
    <li> I started with DE razors nearly 50 yrs ago.  I used a gillette adjustable from 1960 something up untill the Gillette sensor came out.&lt;br /&gt;Went from there to Mach 3, then to electric razor.  All these met my needs but I hated the expense of  Mach 3 blades and the quality of electric is not as close as a blade.  So, now I&#x27;m back with this DE and wow, close shaves every time.  I love it.  It did take me a couple of shaves to remember how to use this razor, went through the provided Merkur blade in 5 shaves.  I am now using a Wilkinson sword blade and it is still sharp after more that 12 shaves. Overall I am completely satisified. As for the blades, I now remember the blue blade vs stainless steel blade.  The blue is sharper initially, the stainless lasts much longer, take your choice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using conventional retail razors for the past 10 years, always looking for one that delivered a better shave (my beard grows pretty fast), and so far this razor has provided the best shave yet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some pros that are worth mentioning:&lt;br /&gt;- Razors last longer (twice as much as the ones I used to use).&lt;br /&gt;- Each razor blade is really really cheap, specially when compared with the typical razors that are advertised.&lt;br /&gt;- And if your eco-friendly, you produce a lot less waste.</li>
    <li> This thing works good. When you buy it get the variety pack of blades and find the best one for you. Razor will accept most double sided blades.&lt;br /&gt;Yep. That&#x27;s it. Ok bye now.</li>
    <li> This little bad boy is Awsome. It took a little getting use to at first but once I got the hang of it and better shave than Fusion or Schick and way better price on blades. I have coarse beard hair and the blade lasted about 2.5 weeks to 3 weeks. My wife even decided to give it a try on her legs and liked it as well and thought is was easy to use.</li>
    <li> Simply awesome and close shave. I like to shave first with and then against the grain, and this razor works perfectly for this. A few reviews on here complaining about longer shaving times, in my case this has not been the case at all.</li>
    <li> A nice razor...but the part about it having a long handle is an outright lie.&lt;br /&gt;My very old Gillette Atra Plus is about 1-2 inches longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice shiny razor though.&lt;br /&gt;Shiny.</li>
    <li> Excellent way to spice up shaving. There is a bit of a learning curve, I did cut myself quite a bit the first few days, however it got better and works well.</li>
    <li> This is my second safety razor. It is the best. Period. At first it took me a few minutes to figure out to get it loosened in order to install the razor. The first razor I had required twisting at the bottom portion. This razor requires the top of the head to be twisted off. Two pieces come off allowing you two install the razor in between the two. The weight and length of the handle work perfectly in order to apply the perfect amount of pressure to the skin without razor burn or discomfort. Most hairs are caught in the first pass. Hair comes off the razor easily compared to the first safety razor I had. I use persona blades with this, which came in a set of 100 for about $10. This is by far the best choice when it comes to shaving. All around, it is the closest, most comfortable, and easiest shave I have ever had. My wife even noticed a difference without me even saying anything to her. She doesn&#x27;t usually notice things like that so that is saying something!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it....can&#x27;t believe I waited 30 years to use a safety razor.</li>
    <li> The first safety razor I own, This razor is very easy to use. Just unscrew the handle drop in a blade screw it back together and shave Very solidly made. Best shave I have ever had, using Wilkinson Blades.  Up Date 2017 - Have owned this razor since March 2013 and it shaves great. Now I use Derby Extra or Personna Comfort Coated blades for a fantastic shave.</li>
    <li> Nice quality, I like this razor, the finish is second to none, what I like is, you can let the razor do the shaving without applying too much preasure due to the weight of the head thus avoiding cutting or nicking yourself</li>
    <li> This is my first safety razor and I simply love it. I can&#x27;t believe I spent so much money over the years on 2, then 3, then 4 blades. The last one I had even vibrated, so the replacement heads were very expensive. This is classy looking, easy to use, and easy to clean. It gives me the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten. I will never go back to the &amp;#34;standard&amp;#34; razors again.</li>
    <li> First to start, I&#x27;ve always dislike Gillette.  I always thought they charged too much for the products, even though I got a great shave from them.  I was sick of purchasing their expensive blades, and saw the reviews for this.  I was excited, finally I can get rid of Gillette for taking advantage of me for so long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was wrong.  I received this with a brand new pack of blades.  Sure, it was nice looking, and felt good on my hands.  BUT, not only was the shave much worse and uneven, it took about 5 minutes longer.  Since I shave in the shower, this means 5 more minutes of running water.  Multiply that by 30  and any price savings is literally down the drainin water costs.  Even after the extra 5 minutes, I had blotches of hair that I missed.  I tried for 3 more days, hoping it would get better, but it didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave up and went and purchased the Gillette Power Pro Glide (I had been using their old stuff for about 5 years).  Wow.  I think I shaved in record time.  Not only that, but it was the closest shave of my life.  I was in shock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I guess Gillette still owns me until someone creates a better product at a better price.</li>
    <li> I really like the simplicity of this razor. The blades cost next to nothing and I get the same shave as a triple blades. Simple to use and easy to get used to. The only minus I have is that you might have problems in your travelling light with carry on luggage only. You&#x27;d need to have a removable razor in there and that might be an issue.</li>
    <li> I was tired of spending around 80 dollars on shaving blades.  Crud would get stuck in between my Gillette 5 bladed fusion and where hot or cold water would not loosen it, I had to use a compressed gas duster (the same one that I used for my computer&#x27;s keyboard) to help me out.  Yes, this felt and looked very silly to do every morning before going to work and school.  Not really a fan of &#x27;safety razors&#x27; or disposable razors, but this is a simple-solid stainless steel product that doesn&#x27;t require that much attendance or maintenance to.  The DE blades (and there is a very wide variety of em&#x27; for this handle) are not only cheaper, but have an outstanding quality to em&#x27; that I saw exactly similar (or probably better) to when I was using my Gillette Pro Glide.  I&#x27;m not that shy about tossing a blade that is getting slightly dull and I can&#x27;t tell by looking at if I should &#x27;change out the blade&#x27; or not without that silly green strip unless I begin to use that razor.&lt;br /&gt;  I do miss the pivoting head from my Gillette Pro Glide and the electric hum when I would start out my morning, but this is nothing compared to what I can do with this product after 2 months of use, the time and money that I saved from the aggravation of cleaning this product.  I don&#x27;t have any problems spending 80 dollars or more on a Merkur adjustable safety razor, which is probably better; but I&#x27;m happy with this model.  When there&#x27;s less moving parts, there&#x27;s really no chance of something getting stuck or breaking.  I am currently using a DE blade that is made by Feather from Japan, but Merkur&#x27;s blades are just as good and less aggressive which means it&#x27;s more friendly to novice shavers than those such as myself that had taken the time to battle through the nicks, cuts, and usually silly accidents associated with this blade.  With any other standard DE razor there really is no chance of cutting yourself when you&#x27;re careful.&lt;br /&gt;  It&#x27;s embarrassing that I&#x27;m writing a review on a product that has existed for well over a hundred years, but I have a lot of pride in this product whenever I pick it up.  I feel strongly that this was a good buy and had recommended this to others.  I had a lot of pride in my Gillette series (I used both the Pro Glide and the Fusion handles) and did not feel that I would be holding onto this product for very long, I was wrong.</li>
    <li> My only regret is that I did not convert to the safety razor sooner! I&#x27;ve been using for a month now, and really have grown into it, as well as my face having adjusted to it. I wear a well groomed goatee, and generally only used to cut it out, and shave on Monday&#x27;s or if something important popped up... I now shave every other day. The quality of this piece of machinery is second to none. It just feels elegant when you are using it. I went with the 30 pack of Merkur blades as well. I was a Gillette Mach, 3, 5, and Pro-Fusion guy for years and years. Always had irritation on my neck, because they pull the hair out - and cause in-grown&#x27;s and razor burn. Once you get your technique down with this, it&#x27;s like shaving ice, and I have thick growth. Never again, and this razor will probably last me for the rest of my life. Lot&#x27;s of good &amp;#34;how to&amp;#34; videos on safety razor shaving helped.</li>
    <li> This product was exactly as advertised and provides the best bang for the buck. I would Highly recommended to anyone interested!</li>
    <li> Wife loves it. Extremely easy to shave with.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t remember the last time I had such a close shave.  Cannot believe I&#x27;ve been using other  multi-balde razors all this time.  Had I known how great Merkur razor and blades were I would have switched long time ago.  Excellent product! Figuring the proper angle of the razor is critical to a proper shave. Once you master this, you are on your way to a great shaving experience.</li>
    <li> THIS IS MY FIRST METAL RAZOR AND IS THE BEST I EVER HAD I WILL NEVER BUY THE CHEAP RAZORS I WILL RECOMEND TO BUY THIS.</li>
    <li> This razor is solidly made, beautiful looking and will last for generations. It is the type of razor my grandfather used to use and he was just awesome. You can buy this razor for several reasons; one of which is environmental. You are not throwing away cheap plastic razors all the time. Another reason is its simplicity. Everyone knows the best designs are simple with few moving parts and all parts are accessible.  It is super easy to clean too. When it is clogged with whiskers and shaving cream, just unscrew it a little, loosen it up, rinse it out and then tighten it down and shave on! It has a nice weight to it and makes you feel like you are using something of quality, which of course you are. I bought the&lt;br /&gt;100 pack 7a.m. Platinum Double Edge Safety Razor blades years ago and still have blades. Plus, the blades have two sides. Can you flip your plastic razor 180 degrees and keep shaving?  A third reason is economical; this is by far the cheapest way to shave. Let&#x27;s assume you are going to shave for years and years. Do the math. Dollar Shave Club is still more expensive. The last reason is the most obvious but like many obvious things, people miss them. You only need ONE blade to shave. Not two, three, four or even six! Here is why: the first blade in these multi-blade razors does the shaving, the others just follow along behind and do nothing. How many knives does a master sushi chef use to cut fish? One. How many times does this chef cut the fish in the same place? Once. Have you ever seen a lawn mower with extra spinning blades that follow the first spinning blade in the same path? I didn&#x27;t think so. Imagine a man pushing a long lawn mower with six blades one in front of the other. Can this guy really justify such a machine as better at cutting grass?  I wish I could give it 10 stars. My wife uses it too. Enough said.</li>
    <li> Love it! Has a great feel in the hand and gives me a great shave!</li>
    <li> I purchased this brand and make based on very favorable ratings from users on Amazon.  To date the performance has been lackluster.  I have tried the unit with both 7 o&#x27;clock and Russian (blue) Gillette blades.  And with blade types, I have yet to obtain a smooth shave.  I think this particular model has safety lip that reduces the contact between the blade and the skin.  As a test, I switched to a cheap plastic razor holder, and quality of the shave improved dramatically&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did contact the seller a week ago  to see if they would replace the unit and I have yet to hear from them.  That is salt over the wounds :)</li>
    <li> Irritates skin and doesn&#x27;t remove a whisker, Not One!  I want my money back and get a better razor. %100 DISSATISFIED.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll never go back to my old razors again. Don&#x27;t know why people ever switched from this system</li>
    <li> I had previously purchased the Edwin Jagger De89lbl Double Edge Safety Razor but it became quite slippery when wet and would break easily when hitting a hard surface. It could be because of the shorter handle. The longer handle on this Merkur may be the difference as I&#x27;ve never dropped this thing. Also, it seems to shave better (less aggressive) than the De89lbl. But of course YMMV.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this razor.  It shaves close, cleans easily, and is very well balanced.  Very good deal for the $$.</li>
    <li> Love the weight and handle length.</li>
    <li> have been using this for a few months now and I have never had less irritation from shaving.  I highly recommend this or any other safety razor.</li>
    <li> I found out almost all Merkur razors have the same Head, Just different handles. I still like all of my Merkurs</li>
    <li> I actually used to shave with a straight razor (both the disposable and true blade styles) but after buying this haven&#x27;t looked back. It&#x27;s easier and more convenient to use, not as flexible but vastly superior in both price and function to a modern cartridge razor. I have very sensitive skin and use this with either Merkur or Feather blades, cold wash the skin, let sit while I dry off and apply a little sensitive balm and have no problems. Cannot shave with electric razors or standard cartridge, but why would you want to with this available?</li>
    <li> Doesnt like it as it takes a bunch of bucks more than other razors but the plating goes off in a week. My razor is just a month or two old and now it looks like a torn off razor used by my grandpa.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and clean. Replacement blades beat the price of disposables and gives a nice clean shave. Will recommend to friends</li>
    <li> After being an electric shaving user for 25 years I looked into going old-school with the blade because it was tired of the scruffiness all the time. My wife also complained frequently about the scratchy roughness, as so did my young kids. I wanted to go with the blade, but also didn&#x27;t want to constant expense of high-priced cartridge shaving heads.  Dollar Shave club was tempting, but at $5 per month for a half-decent setup I was looking at a $60/year just for blades.  I could get 100 good quality DE blades for around $10 right here and that&#x27;s almost 2 full years of blades!  I wanted a nice entry into the double edge shaving world. I read all the reviews and I&#x27;m glad I followed the herd on this one. It&#x27;s plain simple to use, nice weight, and is easy to clean and replace the blades. The knurled finish makes it easy to hold with 2-fingers so I don&#x27;t use too much pressure.  It&#x27;s old school, cool, and gives a fantastic quality shave. My face is smooth even after an entire day. My wife even gives me compliments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I have learned from this experience though is that shave-prep makes a night and day difference in the shaving process. A hot, wet towel to the face to open up the pores and soften up the whiskers is the #1 best thing I can do to make things work great.</li>
    <li> After years of wasting money on disposal  and expensive multi blade razors I&#x27;d had enough. After some research and reading reviews I decided to purchase the Merkur. This is a high quality well made razor. I recommend the 180 long handle if you have large hands or long fingers. If you have never used this type of razor it will take a little time getting use to. It came with a Merker blade which did not work for me. It pulled my whiskers  and was somewhat uncomfortable. Luckily I took advice from an Amazon reviewer and purchased the Double Edge Razor Blade  Sample Pack #1- 40 (see my review).  After finding the right blade and a little practice I love this razor and will never go back to the disposables.</li>
    <li> Just as expected. I got the razor for my Hubby and he loves it, Now I can throw all the plastic razors away. Big plus ++ This razor saves a ton of $$ over buying the disposable one&#x27;s. Thanks (I borrow it to shave my legs too Don&#x27;t tell hubby. and I love it too!!!</li>
    <li> I was fed up spending $30+ on those awful mach 4 crappy razors. Having to buy new ones once a month, and the razors only lasted a few shaves before the green strip told me to buy a new one. So i stumbled onto the Merkur 180 here on amazon and spent a bit of time reading reviews, finally bought one and have never been so satisfied with my purchase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;make the leap! the merkur 180 is in every way superior to the mach razors. It takes less time to shave, a much MUCH smoother shave, the razors cost next to nothing, and their is very little irritation and cuts. I hated shaving before i bought this razor, and even grew a beard for awhile. But with the merkur 180, i look forward to shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before using the merkur, i had no idea safety razors were much more superior. Dont worry about cutting yourself or any of that nonsense. it takes a couple of shaves to unlearn how you used the crappy mach razors, but once you get the hang of it, you will feel like a professional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor comes with a single merkur brand razor, which i found to be a bit dull, and tried a few razos before settling on the Japanese Feather Brand razors. They are sharp and dulls slower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So i purchased a few things along with the excllent merkur 180:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Proraso shaving soap: very nice smell, and skin is left feeling smooth. the soap is mug shaped, so you dont need a shaving mug to mix the soap. just dip the brush in how water, and make a circular motion until the soap is on evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Escali badger shaving brush: spreads the soap even and smooth, very nice brush. cant beleive i was using my hands before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Col. Conk stand: holds the Merkur and the escali brush upright. a great looking stand a must own&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feather Brand Razors: very cheap, very sharp and my brand of choice for blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so stop reading reviews on amazon and just but it! you will be very happy, and will save a lot of money along the way!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this razor!!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a lady and I use it to shave my lady bits as well as underarms and legs.&lt;br /&gt;It works FANTASTICALLY! I have NEVER gotten such a close shave before.&lt;br /&gt;This blade is definitely a little more dangerous than normal disposables, but that&#x27;s only because the blade seems to be much sharper. This was not an issue for me.&lt;br /&gt;I just followed the instructional video that one of the other customers posted, and had zero problems with this razor.&lt;br /&gt;Once you give this a go, you&#x27;ll know what I mean when I say I will NEVER buy a disposable razor again.</li>
    <li> Since the Mekur company has pestered me 7 times in the past two days to do so, I thought I&#x27;d write to say that although I love the razor, I&#x27;ll not do business with the company again since they seem to be attention whores.  It&#x27;s a razor.  It take the hair off my cheeks and neck as I&#x27;d expect a razor to do.  It&#x27;s not going to solve the problems of world poverty, hunger, or bring peace to the Middle East or Ukraine.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo29KVJMAKN56IU]]I just used the Merkur blade that came with the safety razer and it does not feel as sharp as the Feather blades, I don&#x27;t know if its the fact that the feather blades are packaged with two protective sheets which helps to reduce dullness, or if the Merkur shaver I was given just happened to be a dull one. (dull compared to the feather shaver blade.)Whatever the case may be I got a much closer shave with the feather blade. (also it seems like the feather blades are slightly larger than the Merkur which gives them more blade since the Merkur 180 safety shaver has a pretty substantial guard on it.) But please try the Merkur out since this is my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. When i was shaving for the first time nothing was happening till I realized I had the guard upside down : ) so please make sure that the guard is right side up. Shave responsibly.</li>
    <li> I can finally shave against the grain with this razon. I&#x27;ve tried all the major brands with all the aftershaves and razors, and I&#x27;ve always ended up with awful razor burn. Not with this puppy. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> I purchased this safety razor, thinking it would shave closer and the blades last longer.  Unfortunately, I have better experience with the three, four and five blade razors, that do at best a mediocre job and the blades do not last long.  In other words, this safety razor has failed to solve my search for a close shave, without irritating my skin and blades that last long with clean smooth shaves.</li>
    <li> I bought this based mostly on the reviews already posted on this item.  I had previously never used a DE safety razor, having started with electric razors then getting cheap and using super inexpensive disposable razors.  Neither of those gave a really good close shave.  I absolutely appreciate the simplicity of the design.  The extra time spent lathering up with Proraso shaving soap is well spent and my wife really likes the super smooth result.</li>
    <li> Im so glad i finally bought on of these.&lt;br /&gt;i recently tried my old razor and can no longer figure out why anyone uses a disposable.</li>
    <li> After years of using an electric razor I decided to go back to a single safety razor. With my first stroke I thought something was wrong as I didn&#x27;t feel anything. The razor was so smooth I couldn&#x27;t believe I was removing whiskers. Completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> I love this razor!  The weight and feel are very nice and it&#x27;s simple to change out the blades.  This is my first safety razor and I wouldn&#x27;t go back!</li>
    <li> Very nice quality.  I like the solid metal feel after using those cheap plastic throw-aways.  FYI...it doesn&#x27;t open on top by twisting the bottom.  The head is two pieces.  They separate after unscrewing the head from the handle.  Have only had it a couple of days but I really like closeness of the shave.</li>
    <li> A fan. I love this and with only a little bit of practice one can make this their daily shaver. Cheaper than disposable blades and made with a heavy quality feeling. If you want to go old school - this is it!</li>
    <li> While it takes a little while more to shave, this safety razor saves me a ton of money in blades and provides a better shave than a schick or gillette. Make the switch-you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> thank you...The Item is as I expected it...well made, comfortable to handle..and of good quality..It is a gift and I am sure it will be liked..</li>
    <li> Great razor.  Used if for a few months.  The razor then broke....could not return.  I wish people still stood by their products these days....oh well.  I will buy a different brand.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for over a year and I love it!  It is extremely high quality and very well balanced.  If I don&#x27;t shave for several days it cuts right through the growth like it&#x27;s not there and talk about a smooth shave.  For years I used Gillette Fusion power razors and thought they were the best, but the blade replacements cost more then the razor did.  So I decided to try this razor and am I glad I did!  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> this was my first DE razor. this model was exactly what i wanted and i got what i expected. on the other hand, having so far only used the blade that came with the razor, i&#x27;m underwhelmed by the experience. i&#x27;d say it&#x27;s just like using a normal cartridge razor - not difficult to use, didn&#x27;t nick myself, except there&#x27;s only one blade so you may need to make a couple of passes. the head is also very wide, so it&#x27;s somewhat difficult to get the tight spots like under your nose.  these comments are more about DE shaving in general than this product in particular, which, again, is a nice tool and you get exactly what you expect.</li>
    <li> Its a quality constructed razor.  The reason for only 4 stars is due to my perception of the razor&#x27;s design.  I&#x27;ve been shaving the past 54 years with a couple of very old DE butterfly style Gillette razors that were originally my father&#x27;s.  So this Merkur razor is the first razor I&#x27;ve ever bought ... and it is a beautiful, quality razor.  After using it what I find is that it takes me a good deal longer to shave than it does with my old Gillette razors.  And the shave just doesn&#x27;t seem to be quite a close as I get with the old Gillettes.  This struck me as a razor design issue ... not a construction quality issue.  So in doing some additional research with this in mind I happened to run across an interesting video on Youtube by a fellow that goes by the handle of geofatboy ...  his video goes by \\&quot;HOW TO SHAVE EDWIN JAGGER DE89 SAFETY RAZOR ...\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His reaction to the shave he got from the Edwin Jagger DE89 razor got me a bit curious.  What I discovered after a bit more research was another much less expensive razor called the Maggard razor ... the Maggard site is easily found by doing an internet search.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The information on the Maggard site indicated that while the Maggard razor looks somewhat like a Merkur it shaves more like an Edwin Jagger in that it has the same blade gap of 0.030 as does the Jagger.  I went ahead and bought the MR2 Maggard razor and have since received it and have shaved with it.  Its now my go to razor because I&#x27;ve found that it gives me exactly what I want ... a fast, comfortable, close shave.  I&#x27;m of the opinion that its the blade gap design parameter that makes the difference.  I have not shaved with an Edwin Jagger razor ... but based on the Maggard site the shave should be similar as they purportedly have the same blade gap.  I don&#x27;t know what the blade gap is on the Merkur but I suspect that it likely is different than the blade gap on the Maggard/Edwin Jagger.  However I do like the 23C&#x27;s mat grip handle.  Both shortand longer handles each have their good points.  If you like a longer, slim handle then its hard to imagine one wouldn&#x27;t like the Merkur 23Cs handle.  I like using it with the Maggard head.&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I&#x27;ve discovered an internet site that quotes the Merkur 23C as having a blade gap of 0.025 inches.  This would indicate that the 23C is less aggressive than the Maggard or the Edwin Jagger (both of which are quoted on the site as having 0.03 inch blade gaps) and I believe this is the reason the 23C doesn&#x27;t provide (for me at least) as close a shave as the Maggard.  This same site quotes the Merkur 34C as having a blade gap of 0.028 inches.  So the 34C is evidently a bit more aggressive than the 23C but less aggressive than the Edwin Jagger.  In any case I&#x27;ve developed a fondness for a 0.030 inch blade gap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had it to do again ... knowing what I know now ... I&#x27;d likely buy an Edwin Jagger (and maybe a Maggard as a back up).  But if one is primarily looking for a razor that isn&#x27;t particularly aggressive (and perhaps doesn&#x27;t provide the closest of shaves) then the Merkur 23C may be what you&#x27;re looking for.  But for me ... the 0.030 inch blade gap provides what I&#x27;m looking for ... a comfortable, close, quick shave.  If a good close shave is what you want then a Maggard would be a good choice.  If you&#x27;re looking for a work of art along with a comfortable, close, quick shave ... then you might like the Edwin Jagger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7/16/2014 ... Results from additional research for those who might be interested.  The more aggressive the razor the closer shave it will provide.  There are four factors that determine aggressiveness:  1. Blade gap.  2. blade exposure.  3.  Razor weight (and weight distribution ... head heavy verses handle heavy).  4.  Razor design blade angle.  The greater the blade gap the more aggressive the razor.  The greater the blade exposure the more aggressive.  The heavier the razor the more aggressive (handle heaviness the more aggressiveof the two).  Information on blade angle is virtually nonexistent ... though I suspect that they all likely use basically the same design angle.  Aggressive by weights:  Maggard MR18 (3.4 oz), Edwin Jagger DE89L (2.7 oz),  Merkur 34C (2.4 oz), Merkur 23C (2.2 oz).&lt;br /&gt;Agressiveness by blade gap:  Maggard and Edwin Jagger (0.030\\&quot;), Merkur 34C (0.028\\&quot;),  Merkur 23C (0.025\\&quot;)&lt;br /&gt;Agressiveness by blade exposure: Maggard, all others tied for second (Edwin Jagger, Merkur 23C and 34C).  The method I used to determine blade exposure was to compare the widths of the razor head caps.  I compared each on a flat surface one next to the other.  The blade cap width of the Maggard was less that the blade caps of all three of the other razors ... so the Maggard clearly had greater blade exposure.  The blade cap widths of the EJ and both Merkurs were identical.  So the order of aggressiveness for these four razors is clearly Maggard. EJ, Merkur 34C, Merkur 23C.  And I&#x27;ve found that the closeness of shave is also the same order.  So if what one wants is the closest shave he can get then find the most aggressive razor.  If there is a maximum to the aggressiveness you can take then does a razor with that aggression give you the closeness of shave you want (is it good enough)?  If it isn&#x27;t then DE safety razors probably aren&#x27;t for you.  If it is then \\&quot;you&#x27;re ready to rock and roll\\&quot; as geofatboy would say.  Happy shaving ... and \\&quot;shave on\\&quot;!</li>
    <li> Tired of paying through the nose for disposable razors?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I looked at this thing and thought to myself: this looks scary. It looks like an investment of time and energy, and I felt that I would surely end up in a bloodbath. I was also worried about the efficacy—would this thing even work?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet there is something alluring about using an old school razor. It&#x27;s manly. Our grandfathers used these types of razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, after some deliberation, I decided to give it a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first attempt was not at all unsatisfactory. It was different. I was more deliberate and cautious than I needed to be. It wasn&#x27;t a bloodbath, although I didn&#x27;t get as close of a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two or three tries, I got the hang of it. There is an angle that works well. The heaviness of the handle is nice—it feels solid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the experience so much, that I have mentioned it to most of my male friends. I have even sent an Amazon gift card to my brother-in-law so he could try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All this, and I am saving $$ in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, here&#x27;s a tip: dry your blade. There is a school of thought that suggests that oxidation is what makes blades wear out, not whiskers. (My friends call me whiskers because I am curious like a cat.)</li>
    <li> Great shave and soooooooooooooooooooo much cheaper than the disposable razors.  I&#x27;ve changed the blade once in the last few months.  Massive savings vs the big brand disposables.  One flaw, it does not have the ability to get under your nose, you&#x27;ll need something else</li>
    <li> I purchased this item based off prior reviews and the somewhat outrageous cost of razors. I have used it only once, but it is very clear that this is a quality item, it provided a great shave, the razor is very weighty and well crafted, no surprise given the German manufacturing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I am done with the higher priced blades, this is a pretty simple device, double sided razor blade and a dome shaped guard.</li>
    <li> I agree with the other reviews. I have used two other similar safety razors.  This one is much better than the cheaper ones on amazon.  This is because the grooves that stand your hair up are smoother and more comfortable than the cheap ones, and because the blade is raised up off the grooves allowing the hair to fully stand up before the cutting starts.  The cheaper ones lay the blade right on the too-sharp grooves.  No contest.  Spend the extra ten bucks and get this one.  I have much less trouble with ingrown hairs and am saving tons of money.  I use the ASTRA Superior Premium Platinum Double Edge Safety Razor Blades available on amazon with this razor.  They work great.</li>
    <li> My husband is 34 years old and he&#x27;s never had a better shaving his life! He grows hair very very fast and very thick but this takes care of it instantly. Very easy you do and very enjoyable.</li>
    <li> This is my second safety razor and much better than the first. It&#x27;s solidly built, the razor is easy to change, and (most importantly) it holds the blade straight and tight. It&#x27;s a few dollars more than some other brands, but well worth the extra cost.</li>
    <li> Wonderful quality, feels solid in your hand, and works better than a disposable razor. If you rinse and dry the head of the razor after each use, one blade will last for weeks! (No need to take it out to dry it.) I&#x27;m happy I won&#x27;t be contributing to the accumulation of plastic waste any longer! Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This is one of the most impressive items I have ever purchased. It&#x27;s THAT good! Designed and manufactured in Germany,  it has all the high quality engineering that country is famous for. Back in the 1960&#x27;s I used to use the standard Gillette &amp;#34;safety razor,&amp;#34; the one that would cut into one&#x27;s face and bring out the styptic pencil to stop the bleeding, especially with a new blade. Seeing some cautionary notes on this in the ratings on this Merkur, I approached the first shave cautiously. Oh my goodness, I was simply amazed!  It glides over one&#x27;s face with incredible smoothness, firmly and easily cutting the beard (and mine is heavy), and without a nick or scratch! It is actually a pleasure to shave now.  The only note I would add is that there are no directions on how to load the blade--I had to look online to a video review to discover it. The key is that the stem unscrews completely off from its TOP. Knowing this, it is as easy as pie.  I wish every product was built this well and performed as beautifully!</li>
    <li> I started shaving with this fine safety razor two weeks ago. And I can only say wow! I wish I had this razor years ago when I first started shaving. I am getting absolutely no nicks or cuts using supplied Merkur blade, and no facial irritation. I understand that many reviewers have pointed out the savings over cartridge systems, but to me its simply all about getting a clean professional shave every time.</li>
    <li> Almost no issues my first time shaving with this style razor.2nd time nothing but a clean and satisfying shave.  It feels great in the hand and it&#x27;s classy on my counter.</li>
    <li> nice razor for the price. nice and sturdy but I am missing the brush and the mixing cup. I would recommend to friends.</li>
    <li> I started looking into safety razors when I started to get really unhappy with the cost of those 3, 4, and 5 blade thingies that always got clogged up and got dull fairly quickly. I started feeling, that those big razor companies just loved selling us fancy crap that sounds really awesome (how soon until we get to 10 blades?), is overpriced, but really offers no meaningful improvement over the old fashioned methods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I started to research safety razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this Merkur about six months ago.  I went to the local Shoprite and bought a 10 pack of blades for $2.99. I bought some fancy shaving cream just to feel sufficiently sophisticated as well. I also checked out other brands of blades, my current favorite being Feather brand out of Japan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict?  For the first time in roughly 30 years, I enjoy the act of shaving again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor itself has a nice weight to it.  It was pretty easy to navigate the difficult corners of my ugly mug.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong;  there is a little more technique involved, because it is easier to cut yourself if you are mindless and just hack away at your face.  I just find myself paying the price if my face isn&#x27;t damp enough or if I skimp out on the shaving oil and go against the grain too soon, but when it works, which is most of the time, the shave is smoother, and closer, and more pleasant than any of those umpteen blade monstrosities, and I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m being abused by corporate America to boot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take back your face, America!  Go old school!</li>
    <li> This is the first safety razor I have ever used and I have been pleasantly surprised as to how easy it was to use.  For me it takes a little more time than a cartridge but the shave is quite a bit better and there is considerably less irritation.  I ordered this one because it seemed the best for a beginner but I am already wanting to try and adjustable one.</li>
    <li> Nice handle, prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> Got this razor hoping that it would help with neck irritation from cartridge razors; after a few weeks of use, no clear sign that things are better, but I do enjoy the shaving process very much and the build of this razor is top notch.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for a few years, and I have nothing but praise for this piece of equipment.  The feel of the cold, heavy metal in your hand, the ease and comfort of the shave it provides, the durability (with basic maintenance--read: drying it off after use--it should outlast me)--I have no idea why we ever gave these things up for the cheap plastic bics or expensive cartridges.</li>
    <li> Before I begin, my purchase was probably open because I received an opened case and my blade was just lying around without a wrapper. It definitely came with a wrapper around it when my brother had purchased it. The blade was damaged or something as it wasn&#x27;t very effective. I ended up having to buy some replacements. It&#x27;s okay since I know I&#x27;ll be using this for many years to go but I am disappointed that I had to purchase replacement blades.</li>
    <li> what a great RAZOR! just make sure you dont screw on the bottom piece upside down or else your razor wont shave! .... i learned the hard way, any ways, i fixed it and its an awesome razor! .... im so happy i dont have to spend 20$ to refill the blades, and even if i get only 2 or 3 shaves out of my one blade, it still dont cost me like my Fusion Did.... took some slow practice, but ive slowly gotten my speed up.&lt;br /&gt;If you have any experience with shaving, you wont cut yourself. i have yet to cut myself, plus i dont hurry either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i use for shaving cream, bump stopper, and Nivea sensitive shaving gel.&lt;br /&gt;Wet my face, use a bit of the bump stopper for a base to get a bit of lather, then the Nivea to follow up and make a good creamy lather on my face.&lt;br /&gt;It seems to be a great method, ive gone through about 3 razors already with that and it seems to be a smooth shave. :)&lt;br /&gt;I honestly dk about a &amp;#34;smoother&amp;#34; shave, i shave both down and up, (with the grain and against the grain) and it dont feel that much different than the fusion 5 blade razor i had. but none the less still a very nice smooth face after. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Simple use&lt;br /&gt;Cheaper in the long run(10$ for 100 razors compared to 20$ for 4 fusion)&lt;br /&gt;easy maintenance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;does require patience&lt;br /&gt;if not careful you can cut yourself&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thats the main stuff off the top of my head that i worried about before i bought it. now i LOVE IT! :)</li>
    <li> The handle really is not that long, though. But if you are going to use one of these I also recommend Geo F. Trumper&#x27;s shaving cream and a decent badger brush. A bad brush will smell bad and shed lots of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, do your research on the blades!! Its very important and impacts your shaving more than you would think.</li>
    <li> This razor is a dream. It&#x27;s solidly designed and built, and easy to use. Was a real pleasure after twenty years of shaving with cartridge razors!</li>
    <li> I love this razor. It has a great weight and hand-feel. What I love most is not having to pay $14-$20 for a set of razor blade replacements. Is it an investment? Sure. But it pays for itself pretty immediately.</li>
    <li> I have a thick beard and it tends to clog those fancy 5 blade razors. I bought one of these and then I got 100 shark blades on amazon for about 17$. These blades last as long if not longer than those crazy expensive 5 blade razors.</li>
    <li> Love it. Simple to use and changes the blade. I recommend to watch a couple of videos on YouTube just to make sure you&#x27;re doing it right...It&#x27;s not that difficult, just let the weight of the razor do the job. Also be careful as it is a blade, sometimes if I&#x27;m in a hurry and I accidentally swipe the wrong way, you&#x27;ll get nicked. Bought a pack of blades on Amazon as well as some Proraso Shaving Cream which is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, note to travelers! I would not take this with you on a carry on unless you want to be stopped by TSA. I&#x27;m a light traveler and don&#x27;t check a bag, but even when I didn&#x27;t have a blade inside I got stopped to have it inspected....Would hate for someone to spend $30 on a razor and it get it taken or stopped at the airport.</li>
    <li> Purchased the Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor for my husband as a nostalgic gift.  My dad always used a razor to shave his face.  He would say he got a more closer shave with a razor than he would get with an electric razor.</li>
    <li> Best razor I&#x27;ve ever bought him.  Merckur blades necessary. Both provide a clean safe shave for very coarse beard stubble.</li>
    <li> So far it&#x27;s lived up to the hype and reviews . First time in along time I can say I get a good close shave. So far no nicks as I use a shaving gel&lt;br /&gt;For sensitive skin. Been  at least 30 years since I used a double edge razor. I take my time shaving and the results are better than I expected!!!&lt;br /&gt;I give it 5 Stars plus 2 thumbs way up!!!</li>
    <li> Craftsmanship is excellent. The knurling on the handle and the tolerances are very precise. The long handle fits great in my hand, I usually wear large- XL gloves for some context. German quality at it&#x27;s best.</li>
    <li> This razor is one of the best quality stainless steel razors I have ever owned. It provides me with a great shave, especially when coupled with a good quality razor. I would certainly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> stop buying those expensive disposable razors!&lt;br /&gt;wonderful close shave!! I was skeptical at first but after a 2 weeks ,I would have anything else.&lt;br /&gt;5 stars</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a safety razor newbie and this is my first one. I am in the Army and shave everyday.  I was apprehensive at first about coming from a Fusion set-up.  I get about 3-4 shaves before having to change the razor; it will be more cost productive in the long run.  The shave is close.  It took a little practice to shave as quickly with this blade as Fusion without knicks.  Now, all is well after learning a few tricks. I would recommend this product to anyone looking to get into shaving with Safety Razors. I would also recommend using a wash cloth when unscrewing the head to change the blade as the ends stick out and are sharp.  Also, loosening the head on final rinse will make sure that all the residue is cleared.</li>
    <li> Buying expensive throw away razors became abusive to my wallet. I spent some time looking for the right razor for me. I was willing to spend a decent amount of money, so i wanted to do some proper researching before I found what was right for me. The Merkur razor has a good balanced weight, with a textured handle for non slipping of the fingers. The only thing to be careful of is the temperature of the water you are shaving with, as the Merkur holds the temperature on the razor. Its an added benefit if the water isn&#x27;t too hot. German craftsmanship is well-known .  This product is another example .</li>
    <li> I am very new in using safety razor and expected multiple cuts, uneven save and a deluge of challenges. I have tried 3 safety razor and by a wide margin he Merkur 180 Long Handle has outperformed and is now my primary razor. First, the unit is pleasingly simple, provides great control and feel. Second, the design is simple but elegant. One of the other brands I tried had a more ornate handle but after a couple of shaves the results did not match the design. Third, the shave is great. I have not had any issues after multiple uses and have been able to get equal or better that the razor I’ve used for many years. I suspect technique has some influence but with the Merkur I feel more in control and have been able to get the shave I expected. I’m still working my way through brands of blades, shaving cream and pre-shave. For now I’m using the Merkur blade, pre-shave with a blend of shaving soap and cocoa butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Didn’t think I would like a 3 piece unit but I find the Merkur very easy to load and unload. I’m thinking of purchasing another just to have a travel or backup unit. If you’re new to safety razor shaving or looking for a high performance razor I would definitely recommend the Merkur 180 Long Handle. I have already shared this recommendation to friend and family.</li>
    <li> It has been 35 years since I used an old fashion long handled razor.  It feels good to shave again with a great razor.  Well balanced, easy to clean and most of all it gives me a smooth face.</li>
    <li> Sweeeeettt shave!!! My face is smoother than a spanked baby&#x27;s butt.  Thanks German made Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor, Model 180.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand it.  This product got a lot of good reviews.  Maybe I am doing something wrong, but this razor does not cut anything.  The blade is so sandwiched in between that it flattens out and I could press down as hard as I want and it would not cut me.  So for me this was not worth the price I paid for.</li>
    <li> This razor is very sturdy, is a good weight, and provides me with the smoothest shave that I have ever had. I will never go back to any other type of shaving (unless I somehow afford myself a straight razor). I may decide to buy a more expensive safety razor at some point because the mechanism for loading the razor blade isn&#x27;t as smooth as I&#x27;d like (you have to unscrew the top a ways, while more expensive models have a &amp;#34;convertible&amp;#34; like top, making the process much faster). If I decide against that, this razor will still be sufficient enough, and made/makes an extraordinary first razor.</li>
    <li> As with most reviewers, I was tired of the rising cost of multi-track razor replacements.  Even the generic replacements were pricey.&lt;br /&gt;And, I&#x27;d been using them for over 20 years, (change is hard)  But I saw the Rick Harrison ads on TV and was convinced it was time to change the way I shaved.  So now I am using this great double-edged safety razor, the kind my father used to use. It gives me a great,&lt;br /&gt;close shave and none of the razor burn I got from the Trac II blades!  It&#x27;s really easy to clean too.  You just rotate the handle loose a few turns, (you don&#x27;t have to take it apart)  and run water through the top.  Stop paying too much for blades, get this Merkur razor.</li>
    <li> This beauty is made for men. Not just any man,but a real man, If you work in the city for some fancy company inside a cubical or some fancy office,stay away. You will more than likely go running to your trophy wife that you nicked your pretty face with a mans razor.&lt;br /&gt;real rough and tumble men need only apply.</li>
    <li> First time purchasing a safety razor shaver. Been using Mach 3 razors my whole life and those disposable ones. Let me tell you, once you understand how to use this and how your face works with this, you will never go back to a supermarket razor again. You will get a closer shave, save tons on money on new razors, less irritation on your face as well+you will enjoy shaving. Best money I spent on myself in a very very long time. I purchased this razor with the Van Der Hagen Luxury Shave set. I HIGHLY recommend it if your switching over to a safety razor and want to get that amazing barber feel and close shave. Almost impossible to cut yourself so don&#x27;t be afraid about that. Just figure out how your face likes to take the razor. Some are angled some straight down some straight up.</li>
    <li> This is a very high quality safety razor!  I love the shave I can get with it!  And I especially love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin as much as my electric razors and disposable razors tend to do.</li>
    <li> Bought this razor in response to the continued rise in the price of current disposable safety razors. Best move that I have ever made. It is built like a tank, shaves very close and looks sharp.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent. I love the price for the blades that go with this razor. Few if any bumps after the shave is a plus for me. Nice, hard, sturdy piece of work for a razor. Feels good to shave with and no razor burn after. I must say that you will most likely need to take it a little slower than the regular throw-away razors. I have not cut myself but I found myself moving the razor in a sideways motion against my face while trying to shave too quickly. With any razor though take care not to cut yourself.</li>
    <li> The razor itself is terrific, however I find if the handle is wet, it is very tough to maintain a good grip.</li>
    <li> Tough to shave around your upper lip and nose because you can not get the proper angle.  Might have to go back to a multi blade razor from Gillette.</li>
    <li> Its sturdy, easy to use, and just works. The only problem is that you must grip the guard above the dull sides of the blade in-order to take off the guard and replace the blade</li>
    <li> Love this. First DE razor for me and I&#x27;ve had no trouble at all getting the hang of it. I&#x27;ve only had a couple tiny nicks. Maybe I have tough skin or I&#x27;m just a natural at it but this DE shaving experience has been a non-issue pleasure. I&#x27;m not sure about all of the characters reviewing razors/blades claiming they &#x27;cut their face to bloody hell&#x27;. They must have weak skin/no skill/or are just being drama queens.</li>
    <li> Have been using for around 10 months. High quality. Fits all double edge blades I have purchased. Easy to disassemble and clean. Nice weight when shaving. Not a single cut.</li>
    <li> I have been using my Merkur for about 6 months now and I love it. I was a bit worried about the long handle because I wondered if it would be too long. I would say the &amp;#34;long handle&amp;#34; is about as long as most disposable razors I used before getting this (the regular one must have a tiny handle). The razor has a good weight to it, and it is very easy to break down to replace the blade or clean. I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> I have a very sensitive face and hated shaving with my old razor, desperate to find a solution I stumbled upon this and am happier than ever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first it was really difficult to use, I even managed to cut myself a few times on it. But after using it about 10 times I&#x27;ve gotten used to it and absolutely love it! I can let me beard grow for 5 days and then shave it and it feels like there is no drag at all. I&#x27;m so happy I found this! No more stupid Gillette razors that cost a million dollars anymore! This will save me tons of money and makes shaving (a once dreadful task) actually enjoyable!&lt;br /&gt;I also bought the &amp;#34;Astra Platinum Double Edge Safety Razor Blades ,100 Blades (20 x 5)&amp;#34; for about $11. That turns out to be .11 cents a razor which lasts about a week (or 3 shaves, since I shave every other day) I calculated it out and I am saving roughly $18 A MONTH because of this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t be happier, I&#x27;m never looking back.</li>
    <li> I was a Trac II user for 30 years and decided to try something different. No more ingrown hairs and shaving has become a pleasure. Hook this razor up with a cream and brush and you won&#x27;t believe the difference.</li>
    <li> I gave this 5 stars because it&#x27;s a nice product. However, I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that safety razors are very difficult to use. If you&#x27;re like me and you are coming to this conclusion because you read that they are superior to the modern-multi-blade razors....they aren&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed this razor so far. Took me a little bit to figure out how it came apart (the bit below the head unscrews) but from there on out it was smooth shaving.</li>
    <li> Arrived the very next day with free shipping. Came in a new box, also ordered 100 Astra razors witch arrived the same day. My father is 50 years old and is also tired of paying a lot of money for disposable razors he ordered the same razor and he loves it. He ordered it first and warmed me to be careful because he nicked a few ingrown hair bumps. I shaved with this Merker 180 double edge razor for the first time two weeks ago and I gotta say it was easy. I had two large ingrown hair bumps and I went over them and no blood, not cuts. No irritation, the razor slides smoothly over my skin, with no pulling or clogging of the razor. I have a thicker beard than my father who is fifty and go trough razors much faster than him, he has thin hair. I have thick black curly beard or had a long curly beard, now I&#x27;m clean shaven. And I&#x27;m very happy I choose this very razor. I do go over my face twice, it only takes me maybe 5 min to shave and I could skip the second pass over if I&#x27;m in a hurry.</li>
    <li> Works great, nice clean shave</li>
    <li> Nothing like the good old days and this guy found out sometimes older is better. After consulting with my banker for the purchase of very expensive additional blades for my Gillette Fusion with power steering and brakes, a good friend coerced me into going back to the Double Edge Razor I shaved with for most of my life if for nothing, the economics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think shaving is his life and he is very knowledgable since he is on shaving forums etc. yes there are shaving forums. Looking in the bathroom, I think my old Gillette somehow went lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like many was thought I was liberated by three bladed, four bladed and now five bladed shavers now with vibration, before I found out I, much of it is not needed and the five blade made me break out from the additional friction. He recommended the Merkur.  Well made, great quality though out and simple,the best part is it cleans up easily and that prevents skin irritation. After switching and a weeks shaving my skin cleared.  the five bladders created too much irritation.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent razor.  I like the long handle, and the Merkur blade that came with it lasted about 5 or 6 shaves.</li>
    <li> I used to really, really, really hate shaving. No matter what I used, I didn&#x27;t get the baby butt-smooth shave I wanted and I irritated the snot out of my face and neck. I had a safety razor about 30 years ago, but I didn&#x27;t know what I was doing and didn&#x27;t get good results at all, and over the years I have predictably tried it all. I liked the 5-blade razors, which seemed to finally hit a good balance between safety, lower irritation and closeness, but no way was I going to pay for the cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided about a month ago, on a whim, to go back to a safety razor. I considered getting the $2 safety razor for sale on Amazon, but figured if I didn&#x27;t like it I hadn&#x27;t given safety razors a fair chance and if I did I&#x27;d probably have to buy a nicer one anyway. I bought this razor, a nice looking brush, and Van Der Hagen soap. I use a Looney Tunes coffee mug my son got me for a shaving mug, and I made my own stand (which came out pretty awesome).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving is no longer a despised chore. Somehow it has actually become enjoyable, something I look forward to. I get perfect results every time, and my skin is no longer on fire (for the first time since the early &#x27;80s). I think part of the appeal is that shaving is no longer a black box process. With multi-blade cartridges, you&#x27;re relying on the blades to do so much of the work. It&#x27;s hard to bend them to your will. One blade vs. your whiskers with you wielding all the power is definitely the way to go, especially when you&#x27;re done and your face feels as smooth as a bowling ball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Merkur blade it comes with is pretty nice. I got some Wilkinson Sword and Feather blades as well. The jury&#x27;s still out on the Wilkinson Swords, and I haven&#x27;t gotten the Feathers in yet. I also have a multi-pack on the way. I&#x27;m looking forward to finding the perfect blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it crazy to be so effusive about a razor? Maybe. I suppose so, but tough. I was tortured for decades and now I&#x27;m free from it.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t put it any other way. Love single blade razors, and Merkur owns up to their name. Could have made the opening mechanism slightly better, but overall, phenomenal razor.</li>
    <li> I finally enjoy wet shaving. After using disposable razors and shaving being so expensive, I went to the electric razor for many years but never really got the shave I needed. After trying this DE razor, I can honestly say that I am not only getting the best shave of my life, but I am enjoying every minute of it. The only reason I am not giving 5 stars is because I wish the wieght was a bit heavier, but I am still elated that I made this purchase!</li>
    <li> I am 27 years old, and in the military with sensitive skin.  I have to shave every day, and used to dread the 5 minute process.  After getting this (with the stock merkur DE blades), some pre-shave oil from Art of Shaving, a badger brush, some Taylor of Old Bond Street&#x27;s Sandalwood shaving cream and Baxter&#x27;s after shave balm...my life has changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a shame I used the expensive 5 blade razors for so long, always blaming my body for the acne on my face, but it was actually the way I shaved--I was doing it wrong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NO more razor burn!  No more ingrown hairs!  I will admit that I had to watch some videos on how to properly wet shave with this, but boy am I happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a wet shaver for life, and this blade opened the door for me.  Do you know how good it feels to finally look at my neck and not have 20 little red bumps, all on top of what looks like rough red sandpaper?  This changed my life, and hopefully it will change yours too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw this is so much more ridiculously cheaper than using Gillette blades it isn&#x27;t even funny.  I get a closer shave, and wake up earlier now to shave, because it is a pleasure!</li>
    <li> This is not my first Merkur razor.  Its a high quality instrument, and it was delivered timely and in excellent condition.  AS ADVERTISED.</li>
    <li> So I havent shaved in over a year simply because everytime I used disposable razors I would get the worst breakouts and would spend days picking the hairs with tweezers. I reluctantly bought this with Proraso bowl and brush, the white container, and followed all the steps and believe it or not I only had maybe 5 hairs that became in grown!! I am so stoked. Coming from someone who has spent hundreds on shaving creams and lotions to prevent breakouts. This was amazing.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin on my neck, and have been searching for some time to find a suitable razor.  I finally decided to try out a safety razor, because I had exhausted the disposable razor options.  While the Merkur Model 180 safety razor is very well made razor, I didn&#x27;t like the Merkur blade that came with it.  For me, the Merkur blades cause an uncomfortable &amp;#34;tug and pull&amp;#34; and, to make matters worse, I had to use several swipes with the razor to have a clean shave (the blades are not sharp enough).  This all severely irritated my neck.  I&#x27;ve since purchased the &amp;#34;Feather&amp;#34; brand blades and have found them much superior, because I can get a clean shave with only one pass.  My neck is way less irritated than it used to be.  I highly recommend this razor with the Feather brand blades.</li>
    <li> I bought this Merkur after a friend recommended it to me and I have since fallen in love. The handle has plenty of grip, and a solid weight and feel. The weight makes shaving easier and keeps you from applying any extra pressure which can lead to you cutting yourself. This will most likely last me a couple years and I have no plans to upgrade it.</li>
    <li> I love this razor, i always thought the more blades there was the better, oh was i wrong.  One blade is all i need and will never buy those muti blade shavers again, especially with the prices of the replacement blades.  its always quick as well, and im still a rookie, but its a great buy</li>
    <li> Should have done this years ago. I spent way too much money on &amp;#34;new blades handles ect&amp;#34; The single blade works great a very close shave closer than any new blade system with multiple blades. Buy it It&#x27;s cheeper to buy a complete set brush and soap new razor with blade that to get replacement blades!!</li>
    <li> I bought this razor because I got tired of paying the high price for the multi blade replacement blades.  This razor uses the single multi side blades that cost pennies compared to the mainstream blades and it shaves just as good.  The razor has a nice feel and is just the right weight.</li>
    <li> I bought the Merkur 180 as my second double edge razor. The first was that razor pitched by yours and my favorite pawn shop owner...&lt;br /&gt;It proved to be too light for my tastes, so I passed it on to my 22 year old son. He, too had been a 5 blade cartridge shaver for about 5 years now. He has really taken to the DE style so I have given him my Merkur.&lt;br /&gt;As to the razor, it&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;1) Affordable&lt;br /&gt;2) Well-constructed (made in Germany)&lt;br /&gt;3) A good length for the average hand.&lt;br /&gt;4) Good knurling on the handle provides secure grip&lt;br /&gt;5) Easy to swap blades in and out&lt;br /&gt;6) Relatively mild, the safety bar protects the skin.&lt;br /&gt;7) Great starter razor.&lt;br /&gt;Enthusiasts will eventually upgrade, but those interested in switching to DE shaving won&#x27;t be disappointed with this razor.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended</li>
    <li> This razor, using Merkur blades has given me the most cost effective and best shave I have ever had. There was a time when I used the mach 3, and then the fusion but I have a great deal less irritation with this product than I ever did with those in addition to a better overall shave. If you&#x27;re looking to transition from disposable or cartridges this is the place to start. I suggest using genuine Merkur razor double edge blades with this product.</li>
    <li> This new razor met the requirement I had for a long handled razor. The balance, finish and overall quality material used makes this a good buy.</li>
    <li> I have been enjoying my Merkur safety razor since its&#x27; arrival over 2 weeks ago. Notice I specifically stated  &amp;#34; enjoying &amp;#34;; can you believe that! Yes , shaving with this quality precision instrument is giving me the closest shaves with little or no nicks. The &amp;#34;russian &amp;#34; blades are the best for my skin and contours.I am glade that I listened to my 23 y/o son…..imagine that ! The construction and ergonomics make this Merkur function as a &amp;#34;charm&amp;#34; !!! Can&#x27;t we manufacture a quality razor and blades in the United States of America????</li>
    <li> My husband has been using the Mach 5 razor for years, since it first came out in fact.  Before that, I am pretty sure he had the one with 4 blades. The blades are very expensive. We would  go to Costco, and buy a multipack for $45.  He has wanted this razor for years, but I kept putting it off.  He got a shave at the mall once, and the guy was using one of these, and BOY what a shave.  So I got it for him just the other day when he was about to make another Costco run. He is sooo happy, and so am I.  Blades are about $.50 each when you buy a sampler, beware, they take forever to be shipped.  But there are non samplers available for about $.01 per blade.  How do you beat that?  a penny a blade, and the shave is easily as close as with the Mach 5.&lt;br /&gt;He feels like he is shaving now, using a very nice razor, not a piece of plastic that was made in China.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A VERY NICE PRODUCT, WORTH EVERY PENNY!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m converting back to a blade razor after years with an electric type.  I tried a few of the light weight multi-blade types and was not very pleased ... so decided to go all the way with a heavy, high-quality, double blade razor.  I have not been disappointed.  The first shave was with the included Merkur-Razor blade.  On the first downward pass in front of my right ear, my first thought was that I had forgotten to put in the blade .... very smooth. I ordered additional Merkur-Razor blades and am pleased.  I have also order some Personna Red Pack blades but have not used them yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall ... I consider this an excellent product.</li>
    <li> no rust handles very good , probably saved hundreds of dollar in the last couple of years since i have been using this</li>
    <li> The razor is not nicely balanced;  it is heavily weighted to the end holding the blade, causing some instability when holding it.  Also, the handle feels like there is not enough substance to sit comfortably in your hand.  It&#x27;s like holding a pencil with a stone glued to one end.  Modern-style  razors are poor quality, but I would argue the shape and styling are better.  If you are thinking of buying this razor, you should be prepared for the trade-off.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality. Plain, old fashion, comfortable handle. Easier to use than the short version. Should last between 10 and a hundred years.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for an alternative for shaving from electric and the 5 blade jobies as both seem to cause my hairs to become ingrown and also only allowed me to shave every two to three days because of the irritation.  I read an awesome review regarding the Merkur and it had me sold on at least giving it a shot.  I finally made the purchase and I am never looking back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did make the mistake of not purchasing a badger brush and one of the recommended soaps that are all natural, but they are on the way to the house now and I am looking forward to an even more awesome shaving experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only wish is that I would have known about this alternative before now.  My face is so much smoother and the experience of shaving with a single blade just makes me feel that more manly (I know it sounds cliche, but it really does).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you happen to take the plunge you won&#x27;t be sorry that you did.  I highly recommend it not only for the improved, manly shaving experience, and smoother skin.  Also, a side benefit is you will see a definite cost benefit considering I purchased a set of 100 blades for just under $10.  All-in-all, I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong with a safety razor.</li>
    <li> I love the ability to remove the blade when I&#x27;m shaving with coconut oil - easy to wipe off.  Don&#x27;t have to replace nearly as much as the disposable ones.  Not sure if I&#x27;m saving money - but, I find I cut myself with disposables ... - KNOCK WOOD - have not cut myself yet with this.  True, have NOT owned it that long .... but, for me it was worth the money paid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a lot of searching and talking under my breath about the cost of &amp;#34;old safety razors&amp;#34; -  Finally picked this one ... and not sorry I did.</li>
    <li> This is definitely better than the cheap chinese version for a couple dollars. I originally bought the cheap version to use temporarily to see if I liked it. However, I used the cheap version for a long time not knowing it was horrible compared to this. Bottom line is, if you want to try this kind of razor but not sure if you&#x27;ll like it. Order the cheap version, if you like it, order this one right away. The difference is worth the extra money and your skin will thank you for using this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you know you&#x27;ll like this kind of shaving then Merkur is the best bet.</li>
    <li> I bought this safety razor about two years ago and have had no problems with it whatsoever. The angle isn&#x27;t too aggressive, but is enough to get every hair on my face flush with my skin. Paired with Feather blades it&#x27;s unstoppable.</li>
    <li> Since I started shaving I always used a 4 blade or 5 blade razor. The only problem with that is the blades cost an absolute outrageous amount of money. I thought why not shave how my grandfather shaved and save a ton of money in the long run? So I went for the Merkur 180. My razor burn is now gone and my shaves are super close. If you&#x27;re sick of paying for razors just to get razor burn. Make the switch. Very easy to use and my lady friend is too terrified to take it for her legs ;)</li>
    <li> Switched to the Merkuer after a decade of electric.  My face cannot be happier, and I actually look forward to shaving.  This is the only safety razor I have used, but I am very happy with it.  It has a good weight, is easy to use and clean, and gives a great shave.</li>
    <li> Great rating... love the way leaves my skin clean and soft, with the help of agreat shaving soap... I. get nostalgic remind me my grand pops</li>
    <li> wasn&#x27;t sure about making this switch at first but ive never gotten a better shave.  takes a few more minutes to shave in the morning but well worth it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what else you need in a razor. Its made well. Its balanced and its a perfect weight. I love this razor.</li>
    <li> Very good razor. It does the job perfectly.  I noticed a difference right away, will never go back to disposable. The handle is long enough which I like but I find it too skinny</li>
    <li> I just got this razor and after my first shave, I find this to be a great razor. Its well built and sturdy. The blades are easy to insert and replace. The rounded top edge helps the razor glide very easily on the skin. Combined with 5.99 (+S&amp;H) for replacement blades, I can get a good shave at less than $0.55.</li>
    <li> This razor is my go to and I will never turn back to the Gillette Quatro Cinco Vibrating nonsense that is out now. If you want to take care of your face and do it with a premium product this is the razor you should be buying. That isn&#x27;t to go without saying you will also need to purchase quality blades as well. This light weight razor is perfect for a nice hot lathery shave.</li>
    <li> The Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Chrome Safety Razor is the best razor I have used in many, many years. I started shaving when I was in my early teens and really liked shaving. After awhile, having to shave everyday was a pain in the butt and not something I enjoyed. It did not start my day off well. Over the years, and there have been over sixty of them, I have used many of these new type of disposable safety razors with decent results.&lt;br /&gt;  After spending, I would estimate thousands of dollars, I decided to go back to using a safety razor like I used when I was a youngster. I tried a few good safety razors which I liked better then any of the disposal types, I still was not really satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;  Then I purchased the Merkur model 180 and am so glad I did. It was just what I wanted in a safety razor. It is a pleasure to shave again. It fits well in my hand and is not heavy like some of the other safety razors I had.&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;m sure you can purchase a great razor for a lot more money, but not for the inexpensive amount of this razor. As I said at the beginning, this is by far the best razor I have used in many, many years.</li>
    <li> If you want to save money, have the greatest shave of your life, and learn to appreciate the art of shaving, then this razor is for you. This is a very nice beginners safety razor. The quality is very nice, this razor does have a nice balanced weight to it so you do not have to apply much effort. Very easy to clean and maintain.</li>
    <li> A tad pricey but a great build quality. The handle has a great weight and and texture to it. Very easy to clean and replace blades + less moving and exposed parts than a butterfly handle to avoid rusting.</li>
    <li> I got this razor handle some time ago and have been using it daily since then.  It&#x27;s much better quality than the cheap one I started with, and fits razors better than the classic one I had before it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has nice heft that keeps me from pressing too hard into my skin, and the knurling helps me hold on to it with soap and water on my hands.</li>
    <li> This is a really great razor especially for someone with big hands like me. I have big hands is what I am saying. The main thesis of this review would really be that I have big hands. And a short attention span.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like modern razors. I have to shave everyday for work and this has been the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used. Blades last me about 2 weeks with use a minimum of 6 days a week.</li>
    <li> Save so much money using this product . And I get a better shave</li>
    <li> Old school tool that has come back into fashion.  With the newer blade technology and a little care this razor will give you a barber close shave that is comfortable and smooth.  One caveat, after each shave, dip the head and blade into a cup of rubbing alcohol then air dry.  The blade will last two to three months saving the use Big Money.</li>
    <li> Great product, I&#x27;ve had this for over 2 years now and it works just as great as the day I bought it. Easy to use (even for a novice, which I was) and I don&#x27;t see it ever quitting. It&#x27;s been banged and dropped and been through countless airline flights, still works perfectly.</li>
    <li> I have always shaved in the shower and decided to try DE shaving.  I originally purchased the Parker 92R Ultra Heavyweight Butterfly with the sampler pack of blades.  I quickly learned to let the weight of the razor do the work and perform multiple passes.  Unfortunately for me it did not matter which blade I used I wound up nicking myself; especially on the neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not want to give up trying because so many successfully DE shave with no issues.  So I tried the Merkur Long Handled Razor and for me it made all the difference.  The Merkur gave me an incredibly close shave with no nicks.  The Derby blade works great for me.  To further test if it was the razor I used the exact same Derby blade back in the Parker with the same shaving technique and once again had nick problems.  Possibly this has to do with the comb differences and the Parker being more aggressive.  I also have used Astra blades in the Merkur with no issues.  I love the Merkur and will have no reason to purchase a different razor.  I don’t consider the handle long, but normal.  I believe DE shaving can be a real challenge you just have to find the right combination that works for you.  Merkur and Derby will be my permanent shaving equip.</li>
    <li> Durable safety razor with is easy to use . Thank you for offering a product and accessories that have brought my grandfather&#x27;s shaving reality to  a modern world.</li>
    <li> I used to have an old GEM razor that used singe-edge blades.  Well, I still have it, but the blades are so hard to find I gave up, and looked for a razor that uses a double-edge blade.  I figured I&#x27;d have to shell out a significant amount, but this razor delivered great performance at a pretty reasonable price.  And if I compare the cost of using one of those awful fifty-bladed plastic monsters that are so popular right now, I&#x27;ve already made my money back on what I saved by not having to buy twenty-dollar packs of cartridges.  I can&#x27;t figure why people ever stopped using these things.</li>
    <li> This is my first ever safety razor. I recently switched from disposable razor blades to this Merkur. I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I now get a much nicer, closer shave than ever before. So glad to make the change. Excellent razor.</li>
    <li> -there is a guard so it&#x27;s hard to cut yourself&lt;br /&gt;-blades used for DE razors are much sharper than cartridge razors so I can&#x27;t feel it shaving. It doesn&#x27;t drag so I can&#x27;t feel it. However, after rinsing my face, I can see that it shaves way better than a cartridge razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: must hold the razor at a certain angle or else it won&#x27;t cut hair. Takes around 2 to 3 shaves to become proficient</li>
    <li> Works great! A slightly closer shave than the Micro Touch. No nicks or cuts. Reminds me of my first razor, a Gillette safety razor from the mid 70&#x27;s. Wish it was a little more aggressive but then I would probably have nicks and cuts. No more plastic razors for me.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using this razor. Especially when compared to my old multi-blade one. The other reviews are right, it does take some time getting used to using it, but it&#x27;s doable. In that aspect, just make sure you take your time while you&#x27;re getting the hang of the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really happy with this purchase, and I&#x27;m very glad to be off the expensive blade-refill treadmill. If you&#x27;re looking to do the same, I highly recommend you give a safety razor a try, especially this one.</li>
    <li> Like every other new device that you pick up this requires some getting used to. Once you&#x27;ve gotten the feel for it it&#x27;s a fine piece of equipment. I&#x27;ve been holding onto a sensor excel for far to long (resisting the flexible neck of a Mach 3) and it was time that I transitioned to a Razor where I could readily maintain sharp blades without breaking the bank. If you are not patient with this Razor you will not enjoy it. If your set on an ok shave and rushing while you shave stick with a multi-blade razor. If you don&#x27;t mind putting on the training wheels for a minute, this is the way to go.</li>
    <li> This was my first safety razor, I could not be more happy with it. The long handle is perfect for big hands and It&#x27;s just exceeded my expectations. The price was only going to make it better.</li>
    <li> Did what it said it would do.I dont have enough words to justfiy a full 5 star rating however here are some</li>
    <li> My hair grows pretty fast, I am one of those guys who have a 5 a clock shadow at noon due to how fast my hair grows. I usually dull a typical multi blade razor in a week, I can maybe pull it off for two or three weeks if I don&#x27;t mind razor bumps. I saw a video online about how safety razors are significantly cheaper and are a more enjoyable shaving experience. The razor all reviews pointed to was the Merkur Model 180. So i purchased it as well as some shaving cream with a extra set of blades and have been razor bump free since. Still on my first blade too after about a month of usage. I would highly recommend this product for anyone who needs a shave.</li>
    <li> I know the razor is fine and it is my own fault, but I cut myself every time I use this. I tried for 6 months and gave up on it.</li>
    <li> This is the one.  I own an Edwin Jagger, a Parker, and a vintage Gillette double edge razor.  But, the Merkur outshines them all.  First the long handle is a perfect fit for my hand.  New converts from the cartridge razors will find the handle to be similar to the long, thin handles they are accustomed to.  The engineering is amazing.  When I swirl the razor in the wash basin to clear it of stubble and shake it, the water comes off of the blade without effort.  With the Parker, I have to shake the razor a few times to get the excess water off of the blade.  The Edwin Jagger, although a good razor, feels clumsy in comparison.  The control I get with the Merkur is truly remarkable.  This is a superior razor well worth the price.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I was unsure whether the DE shave would work for me but am I ever so glad I gave it a try it is fantastic and I kick myself I didn&#x27;t switch from cartridges sooner. Learning curve was about 1 week now I seem to have the technique down. It really isn&#x27;t as hard as some make out, buy a decent cream, brush, sample blade pack and splurge on some aftershave splash and you will not regret it. This is a great DE for learners, try a derby or a shark blade which are more forgiving than the feathers and merkur blades.</li>
    <li> I got interested in saftey razors because I&#x27;m a cheap a$$. The mach 3&#x27;s i used to use were like $20 bucks for a 3 pack. So originally I ordered a $2.50 safety razor from china. It worked well, but was light and felt a little flimsy. After six months I was convinced I was going to continue down the safety razor path and figured I might as well upgrade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Merkur is much nicer/well built. Has a nice heft to it. Does a better job shaving even though it seems very similar to it&#x27;s $2.50 counterpart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice is that if your not sure you want to get into the safety razor game, go for the $2.50 try it out and eventually upgrade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your feeling gung ho get the merkur and pick up a Van Der Hagen Men&#x27;s Luxury, Shave Set. you wont regret it</li>
    <li> I used the fusion blades, and after the prices went up again I decided to try something different; $30 for fusion blades are simply not worth it.  I tried a few other brands with the multiple blades; but, they could not stand up against the fusion blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, I decided to give this razor a try.  I was simply impressed!  This razor shaves much closer than the fusion ever could dream of.  Also, the blades last me for more shaves than the fusion.  And, it is very simply to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note* You will on average spend about 3-4 times longer shaving with this; than, the fusion or other blades.  But, it is extremely worth it.  And quite rewarding to!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note*  I love the fact that the stem is hallow; hence, it will not trap water!</li>
    <li> This is truly a life changing experience.  After spending hundreds of dollars on Fusion 5 razor blades, the day has finally come when I will NEVER have to buy another one.  No more late night trips to CVS having to feel bad about spending $30 on razor blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, aside from the financial gain, this shave is so far superior to the Fusion 5, I can&#x27;t even believe it.  This is my first review.  I feel I have to start giving back considering how heavily I rely on them.  I can&#x27;t even feel any stubble.  I&#x27;m actually excited for my hair to grow back so I can try it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will admit, I was a little scared at first to touch the razor to my face.  I didn&#x27;t want to slice my face open with a razor blade.  But after the first couple of hesitant strokes, my confidence was quickly gained.  I didn&#x27;t cut myself once!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, lastly, I read some things about how it takes longer to shave.  I didn&#x27;t really find that true at all.  Because each stroke is so much more efficient, it is actually quicker.  Of course, it did take me a little longer today, because it was my first time using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five Stars all the Way!!!</li>
    <li> This product is awesome and gives a perfect shave. It&#x27;s a very well put together razor and feels durable in your hand. It makes shaving less of a job and more of an art.</li>
    <li> A friend recently suggested going back to a safety razor and it reminded me of when I first started shaving some 45 years ago. I used a safety razor back then and haven&#x27;t thought about it much in the intervening years. So it was a pleasure to receive this Merkur razor and to try it out for the first time. It feels good - nicely weighted, it is easy to use with the long handle and gives a very satisfying shave. I would definitely recommend it - and the savings over using expensive cartridges is an added bonus. I&#x27;ll keep my cartridge razor for travel - I&#x27;m not sure how the TSA feels about carrying a razor blade aboard a plane so better to be safe than lose it in some airport.</li>
    <li> This razor is brilliantly engineered in delivering a safe, clean, and fast shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and find that by replacing my blades every 3-4 days, I get an incredibly smooth and clean shave.</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair, and shaving with anything other than this razor was BRUTAL, especially in the winter because of dry skin. I used to get horrible ingrown hairs that became infected. And only a few weeks in my skin looks amazingly clean and clear of ingrown hairs. Get this razor, DITCH THE CANNED SHAVING CREAM (the kind where u have to push the button for the gel/cream to come out) and buy a nice shaving lather. Also recommend a shaving brush and a good cleanser (with salicylic acid), exfoliator ( with salicylic acid), and a lotion to moisturize. These products will prevent and treat ingrown hairs. Make sure all these things match your skin type though, for oily or dry skin. Another great product I use is Trumpers Skin Food. Just buy cheap blades for the razor and make sure you only use the blade for about 2 or 3 shaves and than ditch it for a fresh one. Thats very important. Dull blades will butcher your hair it will force the hair to curl back into the skin causing an ingrown hair!</li>
    <li> Feels good in hand and a great tool for wet shave. Very comfortable and easy to use. Will buy it again</li>
    <li> I have been using this for almost a year now.  It is my first and only DE razor and I love it.  The weight and feel has been great to learn with, and even now feels perfectly satisfactory while shaving.  The whole switch to DE shaving was kind of intimidating, but I&#x27;m very glad I switched.  I have fresh blades for a fraction of the cost of cartridge razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part, wife states my shaves have been notably smoother since switching over.  Have nothing bad to say about this so far.</li>
    <li> Switching to the Merkur safety razor changed my life! The thought of shaving any other way after becoming a safety razor shaver is ridiculous! Shave like a man with a badger hair brush and a Merkur Safety Razor!</li>
    <li> Have owned two merkurs now and 1 other razor. I&#x27;ve preferred the quality of the merkurs both times. I gifted my first on when i thought I had upgraded, but ended up coming back to merkur. This has been my favorite so far.</li>
    <li> I like the long handle. it gives me enough room to see my whole face and to give me a close and decent shave. I gave a 4 star because one has to unscrew the entire top to change the blade. My other razor you only have to turn the handle to open the top to replace the blade. all in all, this long handle razor is okay and should last forever.</li>
    <li> I got into DE shaving after 25 years of shaving with disposables.  The ever rising cost of multi-blade cartridges was the final impetus for the move.  Bought this razor as it was one with most reviews here.  After having used it for 3 months and having perfected my technique, I am highly impresses by this razor.  I use this in my rotation with a 1966 Gillette Slim Adjustable.  This is a fundamentally simple design, very precisely engineered in its alignment and the way in which it holds the razor blades.  I have bought the largest DE razor sampler pack and have tried all the razor blades in this razor.  Feathers, Hospital Use Personnas and Gillette Silver Blues work the best for me in that order.</li>
    <li> Gives you a really nice and smooth shave! My husband was worried about nicks and cuts with using straight razor but he hasn&#x27;t had one.  He&#x27;s had many many more with regular razors we&#x27;ve purchased in stores.  He also hasn&#x27;t had any ingrown hairs, which is a major plus.  LOVE IT LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I got it as a first DE razor, and it&#x27;s worked wonderfully. Good, consistent shaves every time. I like the weight, it really helped me not feel like I had to use extra force pulling the razor along, which can lead to bad times with DE shaving. I&#x27;ve had it over a year now, and it looks like new.</li>
    <li> As a newbie DE shaver I am very pleased with the Merkur 180. No electric shaver or (expensive) disposable razor blade comes close to the smoothness I am able to achieve with this razor. My only regret is not having started shaving with a DE razor years ago. Following the advice in the (I highly recommend this book) [[ASIN:1477436804 Leisureguy&#x27;s Guide to Gourmet Shaving - Sixth Edition: Shaving Made Enjoyable]],  I am trying different blades to establish the best blade to razor combination for my skin. In the limited amount of time I have had the Merkur 180 razor I have found the Merkur DE blade [[ASIN:B000850C1Y Merkur Double Edge Razor Blades, Box of 10]] included in the box with the Merkur 180 itself, to deliver a smooth, close, enjoyable shave. Too bad only one blade is included. I have ordered a sampler pack of DE blades [[ASIN:B001PZEHIK Double Edge Razor Blade Economy Sample Pack #1 - 60 Blades]] and will be trying different brands over the next couple of months and will update my posting once I have gone through a dozen or so brands.  But, I suspect I may have already been lucky enough to find the best blade for this razor. As a wetshaving newbie I would recommend the Merkur 180 to anyone thinking of shaving with DE blades or looking to replace their existing DE razor.</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because I really look forward to using this razor most every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor is a great bang for the buck.  And better, the main expense after the razor purchase is just getting cheap double edge razor blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not know why so many people are so fickle about their razor or the blades they use.  I have used this razor for the last few weeks and I nicked myself for the first time this morning.  I usually nick my face with the same frequency with a plastic multi-blade piece of junk.  Also, I have used a few different blades and they were all satisfactory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As long as the blade is sharp and your face is wet/shaving cream filled, one can shave in the same direction as you do with your old razor.  What most people do not know, that even with the disposable razor, the second one has to push down on the razor to make it work, it is time for a new razor.  It is the same with a safety razor; if one is having a hard time shaving (skipping, pulling, nicking, etc), make sure your face is not dry.  If your face is wet and these things are happening still, change the blade out.  ONE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PRESS DOWN AT ALL; LET THE BLADE DO THE WORK.  If one wants to use a razor like this, practice shaving slowly and NOT pressing down on your face with the razor.  After doing this for a while, shaving with a double edge razor will not be ANY trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For preventive maintenance, wipe the razor down after each use.  When you change out the blade (every week or so), take a toothbrush and brush away the old shaving creme residue.  If you want to be extra handy, put a little 4-in-1 oil on the threads of the shaving post screw to ensure that it lasts for a long time.  Oh yeah, and do not bang the razor out by hitting the sink.  Just rinse the razor and flick it a little to get the stubble out of the razor.  Banging it on the sink is a good way to eventually wreck the razor or wreck your sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**One last thing, makesure the base plate is facing the correct way when you put your first blade in.  The direction the base plate goes in may seem counter intuitive.  Just make sure that the plate is in the same direction as the picture on the box.  (Otherwise, it will not work.)</li>
    <li> My dad used a safety razor while I was growing up, I got my first razor burn using one of these. With the cost of multi-blade razors going through the roof this long forgotten way of shaving is like a treasured secret. With a safety razor you can change blades weekly and still save money. The shave is also far superior to multi-blade razors.</li>
    <li> I was Impressed with the shave I received.&lt;br /&gt;Just follow the directions on blade placement, and angle of shaver against your face.&lt;br /&gt;The weight of the razor it self removes the beard, requiring little or no more pressure against your face.&lt;br /&gt;Very Happy with the razor, the you-tube video about this razor provides through directions on blade placement&lt;br /&gt;and shaving techniques,shaving soaps,and blades..&lt;br /&gt;Take the time to shave with this razor, as it will take a few passes.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy life&#x27;s little pleasure&#x27;s a hot shave with a great razor.</li>
    <li> Great gift for guys, I gave it to my boyfriend for Christmas, he seems to love it and it looks cool</li>
    <li> I have gone &#x27;Old School&#x27;. After using disposable and cartrige style razors for more than thirty years I have switched. Depending on the razor blade itself, you can get a closer shave than with the other types. If I&#x27;m going to shave, I&#x27;m going to enjoy it as much as possible. Shaving soap, shaving brush and a double edge razor. This takes a little getting used to, as you will take your time because it is much easier to cut and nick with one of these, but it is a much closer shave. The long and heavy handle fit comfortable in hand. I recommend this razor due to quality, craftsmanship and comfort. Try differant blades so that you find the one that works best for you. &amp;#34;Wilkinson Sword Classic&amp;#34; works best for me. And at one third the cost over disposable blades you save.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned mine for 6-7 years, and it has worked well, although for the post couple years I have noticed corrosion. It doesn&#x27;t seem to affect my the quality of my shave; that seems to be much more a function of the choice of razor blade (my favs are Astra and Feather), but I still don&#x27;t like the appearance of the pitted surfaced inside the area that secures the blade.  Chrome plated is a sorry excuse for stainless.</li>
    <li> Just what I expected. Simple and effective. Well made and solid. Nice weight to it and a decent sized handle</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been months and, nothing! No response, no razors, nothing! I Guess I&#x27;ll have to look else where for some razors.</li>
    <li> Still have irritation from ingrown hairs on my neck but it has gotten a lot better after switching to these types of razors.  I recommend the feather razors to go with this.</li>
    <li> Cant have better than this, wont return to mach-3 now !</li>
    <li> I had read all the reviews, and settled for this gem. I was right on!&lt;br /&gt;It performed as it should, and has started a whole new shaving experience for me.&lt;br /&gt;Great beginner item. Safe and secure with this dead ringer for a vintage item.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with the short, lighter Merkur.  This one works very well for me.  I&#x27;ve learned to relax and let the weight of the razor do my shaving -- avoiding pressing.  I also rely upon Crew Shave Oil (thru Amazon) for a great shave every day as long as I keep my skin clean, wet and rich with shave oil. AMS</li>
    <li> This razor is terrific.  It manages to beat my old razor by leaps and bounds.  I mean if you use my old razor as the standard to judge razors, I give this a 10.  Disposables are okay, cartridge razors are nice, but this by far is the only way I want to shave from now on.  If you&#x27;re on the fence about which saftey razor to get, you should fall on the side of this one.  Easy to replace blades, and the shave was so smooth and easy, I had to check that it was actually shaving the beard off.  I am used to my old razor which you could tell was grabing the whiskers.  This razor was a breeze. Get one.!!</li>
    <li> Nice design, simple to load and hold on too. Weight is just right. just wish I had the right blades.</li>
    <li> I bought another razor a few years back and this one makes the other one look like a toy. It shaves the closest I have ever shaved and I just love it!!</li>
    <li> This long handle razor is the  best shaver I ever owned.I can  use amy single edge  razor  without  getting cut. I would  recommend to  every body</li>
    <li> Best safety razor I have ever bought. and the long handle is great for my big hands!</li>
    <li> Near as good as a straight razor shave from a barber, this safety razor is the best shave you can give yourself. Excellent product, and so much cheaper than buying disposable razors. Blades you buy for this are pennies.</li>
    <li> Seems to be lots of these types of razors hitting the market. This one is a quality piece.  You just have to find the right blades. The Mercur blades are great for one/two shaves. I found the Astra better based on number of blades. Both shave great, but value is key here.</li>
    <li> This razor works really well for shaving. It has some heft and feels great in the hand. Cleaning it isn&#x27;t so awesome: water gets between the blade, handle and top so it will probably rust if you don&#x27;t loosen the handle a bit to let it air out. I put some regular old petroleum jelly on the threads of the handle every few weeks when I change the blade out. This keeps everything (including the blade) like new and rust free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a product that requires extra time compared to modern shaving equipment. It&#x27;s ridiculous to NOT expect to have to do a little take care of it- it&#x27;s not disposable so it would be silly to treat it like it is. I like the upkeep, but if you don&#x27;t want to maintain your equipment, consider buying some BIC&#x27;s and skip the old-timey stuff.</li>
    <li> I was upset about the price of razor blade cartridges, so I decided to go retro.  When I was in high school, I shaved with a Gillette double edge razor.  Unfortunately, they no longer make the Gillette double edge razor.  I was pleased with the quality of shave I had with the Merkur razor using a boar bristle brush and shaving soap. I felt as though I had as good a shave as I get with a Gillette Fusion razor using shaving gel. I also have a Parker butterfly-open double edge razor, but I feel that the Merkur is a better razor in that the blade angle is at the precise angle I need.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Gillette Mach3 Turbo for the past 8 years, since I was roughly 15 or 16 years of age; used it in the military and my deployment to Afghanistan in &#x27;09; great blade but very pricey.  I bought this razor about 2 months ago, it has been one of the best decisions I&#x27;ve made regarding how I shave my face.  This takes some time to get used to, but once you&#x27;ve got shaving with it down you&#x27;ll never want to ever go back to paying $45 for 15 blades of the Mach3 Turbo, which btw is such a rip-off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two brands of razors I used so far with this thing: &amp;#34;Astrick&amp;#34;- 100 blades for about $11 on Amazon; very good blades for the price you&#x27;ll pay for them; 4 outta 5 stars for those.  And &amp;#34;Feather&amp;#34;- 100 blades for about $27 on Amazon; great blades; 5 outta 5 stars for those.  I get about 2 full shaves with each blade, you could easily get 3, maybe 4 with them each but I don&#x27;t like to use a dull blade on my face, you need that thing to be sharp.  You get what you pay for, but spend the extra money and get the &amp;#34;Feather&amp;#34; blades, try both actually. Costco sells the Mach3 and Mach3 Turbo in big 20-25 blade packs for about $45, great deal but this is the better deal for the money you&#x27;ll pay.  Get these DE Blades while they are cheap gentleman, with everything in life the price will eventually go up once the market realizes how better of a razor and deal these blades actually are!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI: YOU WILL CUT YOURSELF WITH THIS BLADE, at first at least.  I have always shaved with the grain essentially my whole life, but once I started using this razor I have been shaving against the grain.  It almost comes natural to do it with this and it leaves your face feeling so much smoother, but you will bleed if you&#x27;re not careful accurate with your strokes and pressure, no pun intended :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this if you think you&#x27;re a man who can handle a real blade instead of sissy safety razor.  BTW, using this just makes you feel like you&#x27;re shaving in the 1920&#x27;s or something similar to that, like this is Grandpa&#x27;s razor. Enjoy</li>
    <li> Great German razor giving a very close shave! The long handle enhances the shaving experience. Thanks for offering the product!</li>
    <li> i had a similar razor when in military, finally i found another one and it is better than my military one. solid heavy duty razor no cheap plastic parts. best of all no cuts or nicks from blade, very smooth shave and it doesnt get clogged up either. if you want a smooth shave this is the razor to buy, believe me i went thru tons of razors to get a good shave and they all are useless. the merkur by far is a great product. also if your thinking of buying the razor thats on the tv commercial thats similar to this you are going to throw your money away guaranteed. 5 star+ easily you wont have any compliants their is very few products on market today are solidly built. never had any problems with any german made products. its good to see somebody has pride in their product!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this to help my begin by battle against Mach3 cartridge prices, and so far so good. The weight is nice, the look is classic, and it&#x27;s a very forgiving setup.  I&#x27;m ready for a more aggressive shave so Feather blades are going to help quite a bit.  The 180 feels as solid as it looks, and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll have it for quite some time.</li>
    <li> This razor was exactly what I wanted.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.  The weight and balance are exactly right.  I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> At first I was a bit in doubt purchasing this razor, based on other razor reviews (ie) spacing between razor and blade, durability etc. Now after actually holding this product and shaving with it, I can actually say that if you know what you are doing(obviously you are), this is a very good razor especially the long handle helps with maneuvering under the chin and towards the under-ear(you know what I mean) also when going against the grain. I especially like the idea that the blade holder opens from the top and not from the bottom(swivel), because when your hands/palms get slippery the swivel on the bottom tends to turn and loosen by grazing on your palm.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my 20 year old son and he will not go back to regular store bought razors.  He loves it and uses it every day.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT!! Leaves my legs smoother than double/triple razors.  Economical/environmental, The blades are $0.10 each.  Safe, no harder to use than a regular razor.  Good buy!</li>
    <li> These take some times to get used to if you are used to a numerous bladed razor, but once you get the hang of it the shave is close and the blades are inexpensive!</li>
    <li> Comfortable in the hand and  light weight, great first time or all time razor.</li>
    <li> Lets set the stage for this properly, It was a long week and I was preparing for a quiet night alone with my Merkur safety razor. I had candles going, Kenny G on the iPod and a warm bath drawn up. As a guy I&#x27;m sure you understand how I hate manscaping, but I felt I found my salvation with something I had just found out about....A Safety razor. I thought to myself \\&quot;Eureka! Something with the word &#x27;Safety&#x27; has to be great to use on my sensitive nether region.\\&quot; So I&#x27;m laying in the bathtub, my fiance is working late so I&#x27;m all alone and I use a bath pillow to prop my junk up, I lathered up my area and decided to just go for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My junk looked like an elephant that had run through a whipped cream factory. I took the first pass, remember gentlemen to go away from your junk, and it was smooth. I started taking more and more passes and I was completely impressed. I had been missing out. With high confidence after the first couple of passes I decide to try my luck at my testicles. I apply a thin layer of shaving cream and start in. At first it was delicate but ok, then it happened. I was about to take another pass but I noticed I missed a spot so I moved the razor down as it rested on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a grown man, seeing that much blood from your testicles is frightening to say the least. As Kenny belted out \\&quot;My heart will go on\\&quot; I struggled to get out of the bathtub. I managed to get one leg out but the floor was slippery and wet so as soon as I put my weight on that leg it slipped and I fell back into the tub. The cat hearing the commotion decided to push against the door which wasn&#x27;t installed properly so the latch doesn&#x27;t fully engage, allowing anyone to open the door even when locked. In walks the cat and it perches itself on the sink watching as I bleed out in the bathtub. I pull my other leg towards my body and try standing on that leg which resulted in me falling back into the tub and slicing open my arm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I toss the razor on the counter,somehow managing to hit the cat causing it to hiss at it, then me. I grab my towel and throw it on the floor and begin climbing out, as I do the cat thinks I&#x27;m attacking and decides to lunge at me. I get startled and grab the cat by the flanks and fall backwards into the water. Of course the cat HATES water and it decides to remind me of this fact by using it&#x27;s back claws on my chest. Like an idiot I don&#x27;t let go and end up with scratches all over my chest. I lost track of time and as I was climbing out the tub for a 4th and final time my fiance walks in and sees me bleeding from my sack, my chest and my arm holding a cat, both of us dripping wet, listening to Kenny G with candles everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, it was a pretty great shave.</li>
    <li> I just received my [[ASIN:B000NL0T1G Merkur Chrome Long-Handled Razor]] and have used it twice so far. I absolutely love it.  This is my first time using a safety razor, having given up on my Gillette fusion.  The closeness of the shave is amazing! I am getting pretty good razor burn, but as it is only my second time using it I have to figure that my skin will grow accustom to using it. It does take a bit longer to shave, but it&#x27;s worth it. I currently use it with a drug store mug soap and a cheap boar brush from CVS but I think Wal-Mart carries the same brand.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve recently taken to wet shaving because I have to shave every day for work and the cartridge style shaving wasn&#x27;t working well and was leaving my face really sore.  I&#x27;ve been using the Merkur 5 days a week for about a month and I&#x27;m so glad I made the switch.  I didn&#x27;t have any trouble adjusting.  I&#x27;ve nicked myself a few times but I think that&#x27;s to be expected.  The closeness of the shave is amazing as long as you keep a sharp blade in it.  Right now I&#x27;m working on finding the right blade for me.  I definitely recommend this.  The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is that I agree with the people (person) that mentioned they wished the head was a little heavier.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good razor. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> It works OK, but for what I paid for it, you can buy a lot of Gillette Fusion cartridges. The shave is in no way superior.</li>
    <li> Handle is ok, but the blade I was send was pretty dull. Cool for that old-fashioned sensation, but the modern blades just work so much faster.</li>
    <li> Little background on me...    I&#x27;m a 27 year old guy who hated shaving. Even though I needed to shave at least every other day, I shaved once a week. I sported a neck beard most of the time because I just hated to shave. I hated to shave so much in fact, that I decided to grow a handlebar mustache. Well, as time went on and it became time to start waxing my manly man &#x27;stache, I decided the look wasn&#x27;t right for me and I shaved it all of except a goatee.    I then decided that I should try a new (er, old?) style of shaving. I picked up this razor, a beaver-hair brush, some shaving soap, and away I went.     I love shaving now. It just feels so awesome to spend the time shaving like my grandaddy used to shave. The closeness you get with this razor is really hard to believe until you try it.     Please note: when you use this style of razor, you will want to actually shave your face 2-3 times. First time you shave, shave with the grain. For your second and third passes, shave against the grain. It really makes your face so incredibly smooth, and the entire experience is just enjoyable. It takes about 5-7 more minutes to shave than it does with canned cream and a newer razor, but the quality and the enjoyablity (made up word) more than makes up for the extra time.    Also, I know that $40 can be a hefty initial investment for some people, but you have to remember that you can buy 100 razor blades for it for 17 dollars. Compare that to like 8 blades for 20 bucks for newer, multi-blade razors. It doesn&#x27;t take very long for this blade to pay for itself and then some, and to make it sweeter, you&#x27;ll actually enjoy shaving.</li>
    <li> Sturdy, easy to clean, does not let the blade loose.</li>
    <li> Safety razor looks nice, but it came with NO BLADES</li>
    <li> 1) The razor is an excellent alternative to being a gillette/schick slave.  2) It is a very cheap shave, a very close shave and a very easy shave, once you know what you&#x27;re doing.    I have very very sensitive skin and the first time I used this razor, I had tons of nicks. It was not a good situation. I was then told by a friend to follow the following procedure and my shave has been great ever since:   While in a hot shower, wash your face with a good preshave scrub to scrub away all dead skin (I use 1 by Anthony, but i&#x27;m sure they are all good.)  I then coat my face with \\&quot;nivea 3\\&quot;, which is nivea liquid 3-in-one body soap, shampoo and shaving cream. I&#x27;m sure any shaving cream is good.  I then proceed to shave down/across my face and neck. I eventually go over the rough spots against the grain to get extremely close. I use very short strokes.    Warning -&gt; Be careful when changing the blade and when shaving over pimples!</li>
    <li> best purchase i have done all year , sames me money makes shaving fun and it look good.</li>
    <li> I love this razor. What a nice shave, fits in my big hand and glides around my face with ease. I read all the reviews before my purchase and glad I did. What a surprise of the high quality and craftsmanship. I love German made products. My first one was a vacuum cleaner years ago. What a perfect balance and grasp it has even with wet hands. I enjoy using this and look forward to my AM shave.A mighty fine instrument!</li>
    <li> I recently decided to try shaving with a double-edged safety razor.  After looking at reviews online, I settled on this one.  So far, I love it.  The razor has a sturdy weight and feel to it, as well as a nice long handle that fits well in my hands.  Also, after purchasing this razor, I discovered that several of my friends have the exact same model.  We all love it, and I would highly recommend this fine shaving tool for anyone who would like an irritation-free, close shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m old enough to remember examining my father&#x27;s old safety razor. It was a butterfly type which means that the blade installed by twisting on the end of the razor which caused the two blade covers to open for blade changes. Blade installation here is not as easy but it is easy enough and should be unbreakable. The razor separates into three pieces: a handle, a blade platform and a curved blade cover. If you reassemble the blade platform upside down - the razor will not work because the blade will not be exposed. The metal ridges of the blade platform should face up! If you intentionally install the platform upside down, it will make the razor safer for travel. This foolproof, sturdy razor works very well and DE blades are about a dime each! Someday I&#x27;ll check and see if there is a butterfly Merkur. Maybe a gold tone one like my dad&#x27;s old Gillette.</li>
    <li> This razor does what it is advertised to do. Comfortably provides a great save without spending a mint on modern multi-blade razors.</li>
    <li> Good weight. My only complaint is probably a complaint I would have of any similar safety razor: it is difficult to shave close to my nose due to the rounded shape. I end up using a different razor to get right under my nose. Little picky, I know, but when I shave, I want the hair gone not just mostly gone. This isn&#x27;t a big enough issue to make me look for a replacement though.</li>
    <li> I decided to go old school. Today&#x27;s razor just don&#x27;t cut it cost wise. Decided I would just go back to using this type of razor. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m going to save money in the long run.</li>
    <li> Sorry to scream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This changed my life. The blades stay sharp forever, don&#x27;t cost anything, and the blades don&#x27;t hit the face... just the hair. It&#x27;s so much more comfortable, so much less irritation.  I am amazed how many years I wasted money on irritating 5xblades that were $30 for 10 blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing is so enjoyable. If you are worried about cuts, I have been trying to cut myself and can&#x27;t. It&#x27;s called safety for a reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will change your routine. Do it. It&#x27;s awesome.</li>
    <li> I recently switched from the multi-blade razors to the Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor. It took a little bit of time to adjust back to the single razor but for me the razor cuts better than the multi-bladed brands and the newest bladed razor will not force to go to a different razor. With this razor I am set for a long time without having to change to the latest and not so greatest multi-bladed razor. Overall, I am very pleased with the purchase and the closeness of the shave is far above any of the blades I have used prior. Since nothing is perfect, I went with four stars since 4.5 stars was not an option.</li>
    <li> I read an article about how you can save money and produce less waste (throwing away disposable razors) while getting a better shave with a safety razor. It sounded interesting so I started researching it more. I found this razor at a reasonable price and had great reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used a Mach 5 and disposable razors all my life. I hated shaving and would only do so two to three times a week. I always suffered from razor burn, bumps and ingrown hairs, no matter what I tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor with Guard, Personna Double Edge Razor Blades, 100 Count, Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush and Proraso Shaving Soap, Eucalyptus &amp; Menthol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me, the razor was a bit intimidating, I was worried about nicking my face up on the first few shaves. But after watching a few videos, I found it really easy to use and it gives a great close shave with little to no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor has a great classic look and I now look forward to shaving. It feels more like a luxury than a chore, like I&#x27;m treating myself each day.</li>
    <li> I get a closer shave with this razor than I did with a Mach 3.  I also have less skin irritation.  This handle has good weight, is very easy to use, and replacements for it cost pennies on the dollar.  Wish I had discovered Merkur long ago,  I would probably have hundreds of dollars in my pocket, instead of trashing countless mach 3 razor refills.</li>
    <li> this is an outstanding razor to start with when switching or just starting to shave with a double edge razor. The handle is nice length.</li>
    <li> Bought this new razor and wanted to us it immediately but the package was missing the sample platinum stainless blade.  So much for trying the new product.  I found the little piece of paper which was supposed to have the blade but it was missing.  I will never order from Cache Beauty Supply again.  Watch out Amazon, false advertising on this order!!!!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe what a difference that razor makes.  I&#x27;ve used Guilette razors for years and had no idea what I was missing.  The razor itself is weighty but well balanced.  It gives the closest, most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> I had no idea that razors were actually like this. I had been shaving with the Gillette fusion (about 8 bucks a piece) since i started shaving. This gets closer than that at a serious fraction of the price. Try it.</li>
    <li> This is my second one. Have my first one to my dad. Love merkur</li>
    <li> I love this razor. I bought it along with the add on Merkur Razor blades and have loved shaving with it. The only drawback is the handle is a little small but no way I will rate it low. It shipped without any problems. Great fathers day gift!</li>
    <li> like the old time feel of it.  well constructed.</li>
    <li> I was referred to this item from a friend and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the product. Helps with a close shave and makes you not want to go back to those high priced razors. Just makes sure you have the time to actually concentrate on what you&#x27;re doing because at the end of the day, it&#x27;s still a straight edge razor blade.</li>
    <li> First double edge razor I&#x27;ve used in decades.  Works great, but it&#x27;s a lot heavier than the ones I&#x27;ve been using</li>
    <li> Like the long handle, it really helps get a grip on it.  This razor is my main &#x27;go to&#x27; razor almost every day.</li>
    <li> I did a grip load of research before I actually decided to purchase this. Dollar value is top notch! Way better priced than other sellers online too. Off the bat you can tell that this will last for quite a long while.</li>
    <li> Perfect, I would suggest buying this. Great results and will save you money!!</li>
    <li> Well... I&#x27;ve had this razor for 3-1/2 yrs. It did well without any real problems. Today though as I went to change the blade the head busted off from the bolt that holds the head to the handle. Maybe a freak occurrence,  still disappointing though. Think I&#x27;ll go for a butterfly model this time around.</li>
    <li> Everything you&#x27;ve read about the benefits of using a merkur double edged razor is true. After buying a $2 one prior to my merkur I thought DE shaving was not for me. But I told myself I needed to try use this handle first before I completely count it out. Lo and behold it was a difference of night and day. A very smooth quality shave with little to no irritation. I&#x27;m also using the feather blades with this razor as most people have recommend the merkur/feather combination. Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> After watching my husband turn into a &amp;#34;gourmet shaver,&amp;#34; I told him I was jealous. And he got me this razor as part of a starter pack, including a variety pack of blades, a brush, and several shaving soaps &amp; creams. He said that after researching, it sounded as if the long handle razor was better for women because of the need for more reach. Since I haven&#x27;t used the short handle, I can&#x27;t say if there would be a difference, but this works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After only a few shaves, this razor worked quickly and thoroughly. One of the tricks is using very hot water to rinse the blade. Compared to buying replacement cartridges, this is so much less expensive. I was using the cartridges a little longer than their useful life because of the price. (What a racket those manufacturers have going!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this razor and I highly recommend it for women who want a great shave at a very low price.</li>
    <li> I found this unit very difficult to open and close.  Seems like the blade should mount much easier.</li>
    <li> Great little setup. Glad I gave it a go!</li>
    <li> Husband wanted to try this, I&#x27;m sure it would work for someone who really knew how to use it but I think he will stick to his other brand razor. I&#x27;ve noticed he hasn&#x27;t used it in a while. I also noticed he was trying to look on YouTube for instructions on how to use it. I don&#x27;t think he has the patience to keep trying but when he did try it was a better shave than his name brand razors.</li>
    <li> I am a wet shaver and have been for a while.  My original razor was a vintage Gillette Fat Boy, which is a nice adjustable razor.  That said, I think this is a better razor for anyone.  I think it does a great job and I honestly never adjusted the Fat Boy.  Give this guy a try and pair it with the nice sharp Feather razor blades.  You should be able to get a super close shave every time, if you take your time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Super smooth finish&lt;br /&gt;Simple to change blades&lt;br /&gt;Gives a great shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The handle could be larger diameter and a bit heavier for my taste</li>
    <li> Great Product!  Arrived exactly as expected, high quality.</li>
    <li> It has a nice heft to it, very solid.  Simple design, easy to change the blade.  Feels solidly built.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really know where to start. Try to imagine mowing your lawn for several years with an old worn out push mower and then suddenly one day getting the chance to mow with a top of the line riding lawn mower with built int cup holder. That is what the experience is like switching from your average multi blade grocery store razors to this safety razor.</li>
    <li> This razor is great. It is my first safety razor, so this review is geared more toward the individual deciding whether or not to switch. The razor has a great weight in your hand and looks much cleaner and sleeker than a regular razor. You can tell just holding it that the razor is high quality. I&#x27;ve been shaving for a month and haven&#x27;t had any issues with rusting. It does take longer to shave with a safety razor, but the shave is much cleaner. I am no longer getting razor burn (which has always been a bad problem for me) and I cut myself less often with this razor than a regular razor. Highly recommend switching to a safety razor and this is a great way to start.</li>
    <li> My First DE razor in 50+ years, things have really changed from the old Gillette razor that I gave up for an electric shaver, this razor is the one that all others should be.</li>
    <li> My only regret about this razor is that I did not buy it sooner!  For the better part of a year I went back and forth about the purchase and now that I have my Merkur - I will never go back!  My sensitive skin has given me a great deal of trouble over the years.  I did find a good combination of disposable multi-blade razors and shaving lotions, but the razor pulled too much on the hairs and left my skin tender.  The cost of these items was also becoming excessive.&lt;br /&gt;You can get some good information on shaving on &amp;#34;The Art of Maniless&amp;#34; website.  Do a little research on the web about what model is best suited for your needs.  There are a few variations, but they all complete the same essential function.  I purchased the Merkur Blades and am happy with the shave I get from them.  The longer I have the razor, I will probably purchase a &amp;#34;variety pack&amp;#34; to see which blade gives me the best shave.  Check out YouTube for some good techniques and tips to shaving with the Merkur Safety Razor.  Also, make note of the badger hair brush, soaps, and moisturizer that people recommend.  You may look to purchase these items and the blades as a &amp;#34;package.&amp;#34;  This may also save you some money.</li>
    <li> This safety razor is generally considered the gold standard. If you are ready for a safety razor because you feel it is more manly, will give you a better shave or will allow you to save money on blades, then this is the razor you should choose. Do not expect it to be easy at first. It is different from common stick razors, but if you are willing to make the investment, you will be pleased with the outcome. It is best when paired with shaving soap.</li>
    <li> Time to toss the overly marketed, latest &amp; not greatest 2,3,4 or 5+ blade systems and get an awesome razor for the next 30+ years. I read a lot of reviews before decising upon this razor, and could not be happier. I questioned the &amp;#34;long&amp;#34; model - but really glad I purhased the long. I buy large or XL gloves, not sure of my actual hand size, but I cannot imagine using a &amp;#34;short&amp;#34; or regular, instead of this. This razor has a great feel, nice weight and balance. I purchsed the &amp;#34;Feather&amp;#34; brand blades at the same time, after reading a ton of reviews as well, and really happy with those as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a different shaving experience than the 2-5 blade deals. The first 5 or 6 days, I was questioning my purchase, as I was as good as the 2-5 blade, but I had expected better than those. I finally got comfortable with the razor and shaving method, and now will never go back. Price is part of it (this is much cheaper over time), but the experience is the super. It will take you longer to shave with this, but worth every second. I also use Taylor of Old Bond Street Lavendar shave cream (I hate getting a burn from some creams),this produces an awesome thick shave cream) Plus a High Mountain White Silvertip Badger brush (the trick is to get the silvertip badger if that is in the budget, else read the reviews and pick a highly rated badger hair brush). Jack Black pre-shave starts the whole experience off, and away I go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are thinking about switching back to a safety razor, just give the process a week or so to get the hang of it. initially it is intimidating thinking of shaving with a real razor, but start with a very light hand, and slowly increase as you get the hang of it. Take an extra minute or two and enjoy the experience. You will not regret it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update - I have had the razor about 45 days. Zero cuts. shave is closer than ever. Zero irritation. I get about 5-7 days for a blade (I think you can tell you need to switch to a new blade easier with these tahn the 2-5 blade deals, as the shave is so close she you have a new blade.</li>
    <li> Long time amazon buyer - have purchased many items, but this is the first I&#x27;ve ever reviewed.  Love this razor!  No more plastic garbage!  Shave is incredible, and it cuts you less than the disposable varieties.  In addition, it doesn&#x27;t clog when you shave your thick beard off!</li>
    <li> Very nice razor.  I&#x27;ve been using a Mach 3 for several years and just didn&#x27;t want to pay for their blades anymore.  I read the reviews, watched a few videos and did my due diligence before buying.  I&#x27;ve had this for 3 weeks and don&#x27;t envision ever going back to cartridges.  I&#x27;m beginning to get comfortable with this razor (it does take some practice), I use good soap (Proraso Menthol) and do 3 passes.  So far I&#x27;ve only used the Merkur blade but it&#x27;s about due for a change, so I&#x27;ll break into the variety pack I bought from Amazon next.  I get a closer shave and my skin looks better as well.  I&#x27;ve been shaving my head for a few weeks also but not ready to use the Merkur yet.  I&#x27;d have to get really comfortable with it before I do so until then it&#x27;s a Headblade and use the Mach 3 for a touch up.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I went 10 years of shaving with over priced disposables.  This razor is simply amazing.  Looks slick and gives a great close shave when paired with persona blades.  This is my first safety razor and the one I recommend to anyone looking to try out shaving with a safety razor.  Between the build quality and looks you can&#x27;t go wrong.  Best Merkur on Amazon.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend had been looking everywhere for the long-handled razor. I&#x27;m so glad I finally found one! He loves this razor!</li>
    <li> Holds your razor blade the same way every time and exposes the same amount of cutting surface every time.  Consistency is great.  Very durable and heavy.  The only downside is the way you have to put the razor blade in. (Screwing and unscrewing the head from the handle)  Which isn&#x27;t much of a downside given how easy and quick it is anyway.  I would definitely recommend buying this razor.</li>
    <li> Like many people who will read this, I began looking into wet shaving after reading a few articles about it that piqued my interest. What I was expecting: save money, get a closer shave, and reduce razor burn. This last expectation was particularly important since I seem to constantly have a little bit of razor burn along the the hairline on my neck. Short story is that this razor has met all of my expectations and has completely transformed the way that I shave. Below, I will first review the razor. After that, I will give you some tips that helped me out when first dabbling in wet shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review: The razor is very easy to use. The handle screws off very easily and allows for a quick change of blades when needed. The long handle definitely helps with the transition from the newfangled 5-blade razors back to an era of retro shaving. The razor feels naturally comfortable in my hand. The guard is definitely helpful while learning the art of wet shaving. My only concern about the razor itself is keeping it shiny and new - the top loses its luster after a couple of uses unless you diligently keep it polished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;-Don&#x27;t be nervous. There are a lot of people who say that you will cut yourself until you figure out how to use it. I have never cut myself using this razor, and it is designed to protect you from yourself in most situations.&lt;br /&gt;-Don&#x27;t apply pressure to the razor when shaving.&lt;br /&gt;-Take short strokes and rinse your blade often.&lt;br /&gt;-Go slow and enjoy the experience. I find myself speeding up from time to time, but I remind myself to slow down so that I won&#x27;t cut myself or irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;-Shave with the grain the for the first pass. I usually take two passes over my face, both times going with the grain. If you want a very close shave, go against the grain on the second pass, but do so cautiously. See how your skin reacts to this before you decide whether or not to continue shaving against the grain for future shaves. Keep in mind that while shaving, you aren&#x27;t trying to remove all of the hair in one fell swoop. Instead, aim to reduce facial hair with each pass.&lt;br /&gt;-Develop a ritual. I always take a warm shower and use an exfoliating scrub to clean my face to loosen the hair up as much as possible. After my shower, I apply a hot washcloth (dampened and microwaved for 30 seconds) to my face to further loosen the hairs. Be cognizant of the temperature of the washcloth though. During my shower, I soak my badger brush in hot water to prepare it for use. I am a fan of pre-shave oils because it allows the razor to glide even more effortlessly over my skin, so I apply this once I remove the washcloth. Next, I remove my brush from the mug of hot water (also microwaved for 30 seconds (pre-shower)) and place my razor in there to get it warmed up while I lather up. After shaving, I apply a shaving cream to moisturize and protect my skin.&lt;br /&gt;-Figure out which products you like to use to accompany your shave. Try different brands until you find one that you really enjoy. You have already invested in a quality safety razor that will essentially last you the rest of your life (or until you change razor types), so invest in products to accompany your shave, many of which will also last for a good stretch of time.&lt;br /&gt;-Read some tips given by people who have been wet shaving for a while so that when you take that first stroke, you do so with confidence.ep in mind that while shaving, you aren&#x27;t trying to remove all of the hair in one fell swoop.

    <li> Great quality and a better shave than anything else I&#x27;ve used. Never going back to Mach 3 or the others again.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he just loves it. He prefers it over a mach3 because it is small enough to get close up under his nose to get the cleanest shave possible.  My dad used one of these razors back in the 70-80s.  If it aint broke, don&#x27;t fix it. It works, plain and simple.</li>
    <li> simple - well balanced- perfect weight- best handled I ever owned</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using for a few a months now. This is a quality feeling item, and looks as shiny as the day I got it after a quick rinse. My neck feels and looks less irritated than it did while using conventional, after getting used to the feel. There definitely is a bit of a learning curve switching from a Mach 3/Hydro or other blades of that style, but there is plenty of help available on YouTube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Months later and I&#x27;m still less than halfway through a box of 100 replacement blades that cost only $10, no $20 monthly refills, which was the biggest reason I switched.</li>
    <li> Great DE safety razor for reasonable price. No complaints, easy to assemble and clean.</li>
    <li> This has a long handle, which makes it easier for my husband to hold.  He hasn&#x27;t had razor burn since he started using this razor.</li>
    <li> A beautiful &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; product, looks and feels great -- makes shaving more of an event than a drudge, even after many years!</li>
    <li> Very good quality.  Nice razor.  I have had a lot of razors and have found that price does not equal quality of razor or shave.  This is a nice razor that (for my thick beard) could work a little better.  But it does a fine job one I let my beard grow in with no nicks or cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Safty, like straight razor shaving is an art and it take skill to master.  One you have done it you have search for the right razor blade combo that works for you.  But when you find thatvillusive mix.  It is heavenly.</li>
    <li> This razor is horrible the blade doesn&#x27;t even get past the head so it will not cut at all.  Junk!</li>
    <li> I will start by saying for a 60 yr. old man I have sensitive skin . If your looking for a wonderful shave , then by all means purchase this razor. My first shave was the best , closest shave I had in years . No cuts or nicks at all . Brings back memories of my Dad shaving with his Double Edge Razor. Yeah they are kind of expensive , but your never need to buy another one . The Blade that comes with the razor is Super ..</li>
    <li> Perfect weight and fits great in my hand. Easy to clean.  Buyer beware: only comes with one blade so purchase some more while you&#x27;re at it.</li>
    <li> Ive never used a safety razor before. Grew up using a mach 3 and stuff of similar ilk.  This knocked my socks off.  Totally amazing shave.  Great on one pass. Amazing on two passes for the trickier areas. Super fine, baby butt smooth. Comfortable ergonomics. Just an all around better experience than other razors. Remember, short strokes.  Do not drag it all the way down your face and youll be fine.&lt;br /&gt;GET IT.</li>
    <li> Everything I expected.  I spent a great deal of time reviewing safety razors.  Having grandpa&#x27;s old razor was fine, but the Merkur Long Handle seemed (no pun intended) like it would be a better fit.  IT IS!</li>
    <li> So I bought this razor after seeing a commercial on TV about safty razors (yes, there is actually a commercial on TV) but it was one of those &amp;#34;informercials&amp;#34; and the guy from Pawn shop is in there-you know what I&#x27;m talking about. I thought about getting one of these for a longer time, but I guess that commercial kicked it off.&lt;br /&gt;Sure enough I read some reviews on Amazon and figured that I should give it a try...also ordered 10 Merkur blades to go with it for the start. 1st shave I did with it I was ultra careful, but the result was great: -No irritation, no bleeding, no bruning..slimpy great. I used the 3 pass method and a shaving soap even before I switched to double edge shaving but boy did I miss out on this great way of shaving. I do the usual prep work wich is very important:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.Take a shower warm up those wiskers&lt;br /&gt;2.Use shampoo on my head an beard&lt;br /&gt;3.Take my wife&#x27;s continoner (don&#x27;t tell her)&lt;br /&gt;4. Put on beard and rinse off just before I get out&lt;br /&gt;5. Whip up some shaving soap&lt;br /&gt;6. 3 passes later - baby butt smooth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actual shaving process took about 15 minutes the first time, and I think I have it down to ~10min and get better from shave to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched to Feather baldes a week ago after only using about 3 Merkus and they work even better for me.&lt;br /&gt;I keep my blade for a week, I could keep it longer but don&#x27;t want to risk it yet...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Arko soap (another great product) and an old brush which works fine for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall (excluding the &amp;#34;one time fee&amp;#34; for the safty razor)  my shaving supplies, all from Amazon, cost me about $16 a year, that includes the blade and the soap!! Sure you can bring this down by using a cheaper blade if it works for you. So realistic is anything between $8-16 for a full year including the soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the best part, it&#x27;s a closer and softer shave than before!</li>
    <li> not a good replacement for double or triple blade razors at the store.  I bought this thinking that i would save some money on razors but instead I wasted money on something that an electric buzzer could out shave.</li>
    <li> Husband actually likes to shave now.  Used to take him 45 min to shave with an electric shaver, now it takes him 5 min to shave in the shower especially using the Proraso soap.</li>
    <li> This razor is well made and, when used with the Merkur blade that came with it, provided a close, comfortable shave.  My problem began when I had to replace the Merkur blade with the &amp;#34;Derby Extra&amp;#34; Stainless Steel Double Edge Razor Blades that I also bought from Amazon (and claimed to fit all standard safety razors).  They simply did not fit correctly into the Merkur, and did not provide a reliable shave (blade was not sufficiently exposed, which left a considerable amount of stubble).  I replaced the blade several times to ensure that it was not a defect in the blade itself, but none of the Derby blades would work.  My only recourse is to purchase Merkur blades, which are significantly more expensive.  Disappointing.</li>
    <li> Once again german quality at its best,, the balance,, the weight,, and the feel of this razor with its brushed metal is fantastic,, buy it! U cant go wrong</li>
    <li> I just now finished shaving with this shaver and am kicking myself for not switching back to a double edged razor years ago.  I&#x27;ve been shaving for a long time with the more trendy multiple blade shavers thinking they were better than the old double edge shaver that my Dad used and I learned to shave with years ago.  I hadn&#x27;t really thought about a double edged razor until I saw Rick Harrison of Pawn Stars fame in his infomercial for a double edged razor.  That planted the seed in my mind but upon checking out the website for the shaver I saw they charge just about as much for shipping as they do for the razorl.  Needless to say, I passed on that shaver deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon after, without much thought, I purchased a cheap double edged razor on an auction site and got just what I paid for, a cheap, made in China, razor.  It is light weight, made with aluminum, acceptable for camping maybe but not up to my expectations for a daily shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being a frugal fellow I started researching double edge razors online and was somewhat shocked to see what some of the older vintage razors are selling for in online auctions.  I look for functionality and value in my purchasing and decided to leave the vintage razors to the collectors.  I did an online search for quality double edge razors and found the Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor had an extremely high rating from those who purchased and used that model.  I found the best price on Amazon and ordered it.  As I mentioned I just finished shaving with it and am very pleased with the shaver and the closeness of the shave and without shedding a single drop of blood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is made extremely well with only three parts so it&#x27;s easy to clean after each use. There are no moving parts to gum up as might be the case with the stem twist butterfly style shavers.  For the price the value of this German made shaver is present throughout.  I highly recommend this brand and model for anyone looking to start shaving or wanting to go back to a tried and true method of shaving.</li>
    <li> I just recently started using a DE razor and wet shaving again after having used a Mach3 for some years.  I first bought a Jagger...really nice and I like it but for the short handle so I acquired this razor.  Even with my short, stubby fingers/hands the long handled razor is easier for me to operate.  I have not had any problem with blade alignment like some reviewers have indicated with the two-piece head razors.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as my first razor ever, so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to. This is a great razor for a someone who is new to safety razors because it is cheap and there are 1,000+ reviews (which is why I bought it). If you are new to wet shaving, there are a few supplies you should consider besides the razor:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Blades (this razor only comes with one; some good brands to try are Derby, Lord, Wilkinson Sword, Feather, and Shark, just to name a few)&lt;br /&gt;* Badger Brush + Shaving Soap (I&#x27;d recommend an Omega or Parker brush and Proraso soap; canned shaving cream contains butane, which dries skin out)&lt;br /&gt;** Brush Stand (the brush needs to sit handle-up to prevent the hair from detaching from the handle and bacteria from growing)&lt;br /&gt;* Soap Bowl (for lathering the soap, this can be easily improvised)&lt;br /&gt;* Alum Bloc / Astringent / Aftershave (If you already have aftershave there&#x27;s no need to buy an alum bloc or witch hazel/astringent)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll want to shave after showering, as the steam opens the pores in your face, making for a closer shave. Splashing your face in cold water after closes the pores, preventing dirt and grime from getting back in as easily. For many people it takes multiple passes to get a close shave, I find this unnecessary for me, however it&#x27;s worth experimenting with to see what works best for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is lots of information to get started with wet shaving at reddit&#x27;s r/wicked_edge, badgerandblade.com, and youtube. Just do some searching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the razor:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many safety razors have a short, stubby handles. This razor has a longer, more comfortable handle, something more similar in length to many of the cartridge razors today. It&#x27;s easy to change the blades on the razor, just unscrew the top two pieces and put the blade between them, then screw it back on. Overall this is a good, sturdy razor that will last me a long, long time.</li>
    <li> The razor is beautiful. And the included blade is great too, I will probably purchase more replacements. The finish is excellent. Comes apart easily with no problems and has a nice weight to it. It is a bit too mild for me but great if you&#x27;re just starting out with a DE razor.</li>
    <li> Simply the best razor handle around. Has excellent weight distribution for achieving the best shave with ease.</li>
    <li> I am surprised &amp; disappointed by what happened with this safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, as I replaced a blade, the middle short screw for mounting the blade snapped off upon tightening.&lt;br /&gt;I did not use excessive force. I simply hand tightened it.&lt;br /&gt;Because of the sudden break of the middle short screw, I nicked two of my&lt;br /&gt;fingers along the blade (I&#x27;ll live).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon closer inspection, it&#x27;s clear that the middle screw rusted from within, which caused it to break off.&lt;br /&gt;This is strange, because I always make sure to clean &amp; dry the razor after each use.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I keep the razor out on a stand.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s never been left in a wet or damp environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 years is not a good run for a safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;My father has been using the same basic Gillette safety razor for the past 20 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a what it looks like: [...]</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first about switching to Merkur Model 180, but I am so glad that I did. The price and quality is unbeatable in my opinion.</li>
    <li> i made the switch from the Gillette type razors to this product because it cost too much to get new cartridges. i couldn&#x27;t be happier. not only is it a whole lot more cheaper to buy blades but it gives a much closer shave. it took some time to get used to it but it&#x27;s better than expected. i use it to shave my head. holding it at the right angle is key.</li>
    <li> I received the razor today and shaved with it for the first time. I was blown away by how easy it was to shave with. One glide down the side of your face and the hair was gone without any pull or roughness. Shaving my neck was always annoying and kind of hard with disposable razors, but when I went to shave my neck with this, it was very smooth and a lot easier. It was an amazing feeling to finally shave my neck comfortably and easily. I will continue to use this razor and I will strongly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had over 5 razor holders, some fairly high quallity, but none like this. It does not rust, it does not wobble and it&#x27;s weight seems perfect. No complaints what soever.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor shortly after my son was born because I&#x27;ve decided to start doing things like my grandfather. In a world where men are getting facials, wearing eyeliner, and other girly things, I wanted my son to see that pampering was okay,but only if done in a manly way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On to the razor... I love it. It&#x27;s comfortable to hold and the weight of the razor itself does all the cutting. It is very easy to find the proper angle with this razor and is great for learning. I haven&#x27;t clean shaved in about 8 years because I always got infected hairs with those disposable razors. With this razor, I haven&#x27;t had a single infected hair. Plus my wife loves the feel of my smooth face.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for, glad I decided to make the plunge and invest in this Merkur Safety Razor.  Came super fast, exactly as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 Stars.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad this isn&#x27;t a piece of plastic.  The heavy weight of the metal holds well in my hand as I glide it across my face for the smoothest shave I&#x27;ve had in years.  It take a little time getting used to the angle at which you get the best shave, but not very long before it is taking as little time as the Good News razors I used use.  If you&#x27;re looking for a way to shave with no fear of in grown hairs that get infected, this is it.  Never again will I have to live with lump on my neck or cheek that is infected, ugly and eventually spits out a decaying pussy hair.  Graphic, but true.</li>
    <li> great price and product...beats art of &amp;#34;xxxxxxx&amp;#34;....very well made german razor. I will buy again for sure when needed. thanks</li>
    <li> Nice, simple razor. Feels good in the hand. Great shave. Solid quality.</li>
    <li> Being that this is a German made razor I was surprised to see that the handle is bent. The packaging was fine and showed no signs of physical abuse. But towards the end of the handle it is bent quite noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The overall fit and finish of this razor left me disappointed. The head of the razor also is not quite symmetrical. I can feel a clear difference in the sides of the razor when I&#x27;m shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I just got a dud that slipped through quality control...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this razor in and out of the shower, and it&#x27;s never produced an ounce of rust or discoloration. It&#x27;s easy to install and uninstall blades, and cleaning the razor is super simple. The long textured handle makes it easy to get a solid grip w/o worrying about slipping.</li>
    <li> I ordered this to replace a fairly new Shark clamshell safety razor that kept opening up while I was shaving and nicking me. The Merkur operates differently and kept my newly acquired Astra Premium blades locked down tight. The result? A beautiful close and clean shave. Smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
    <li> I really like the weight and feel of this thing.  This is the first DE razor that I&#x27;ve used, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be changing any time soon.  The handle it long, so it allows for control, especially when I use it to shave my head.</li>
    <li> This brand of safety razor works great. I shaved this morning and I didn&#x27;t get any razor burn not even a nic. I am using Wilkinson sword blades. The set up I am now using works great for me. No more disposable razors wohoo. This is a great seller they shipped the product to my house in 1 day. I would definitely recommend buying from them. 5 stars</li>
    <li> I do not like the way the razor opens up to change blades and it is not a very long handled</li>
    <li> My first safety razor too, after using Mach 3/Mach 3 power for about 10 years.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: cheap blades&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Mach 3 is faster since it maintains the proper angle at all times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for cuts, I haven&#x27;t had any since I started last month. I do follow the advice not to press on my face.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver. Funny, I was in the store the other day and saw the 5 blade razors. All touting how the razor is so smart that one blade pulls the hair the other cuts it, etc. Bullcrap!!! Noting beats a single blade. Don&#x27;t be fooled by marketing designed to sell you blades at ridiculous prices. This razor is the best I&#x27;ve ever use. NEVER a cut.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I got this for my hubby who has a heavy beard, he gets five o&#x27;clock shadow by noon and goes through the normal triple and five blade razors weekly.  This razor gives a closer shave and costs way less.</li>
    <li> Makes shaving so much nicer, easier, and more comfortable! Solid construction and it was great to get the included blades with the handle to get started. Have bought more as presents and would suggest this for anyone!</li>
    <li> I am so glad i bought this. I was very excited to get into the retro shaving world, and decided to skip buying a cheap razor and buy the good one. this one. my very first shave was with the included merkur blade, even as a noob i did not cut myself, though the blade was a little irritating, too close for my taste. my next shave i used an astra blade and it was even more enjoyable. no irritation, just baby bottom smooth, soft skin. shaving is no longer a chore, it is enjoyable and zen-like. make the switch to DE shaving, you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
    <li> The price of the blades pays for this razor the first time you replace the blades.  you get a great comfortable close shave and replacement blades are 10 for $6.00 instead of $6.00 each for modern razors.  This travels real well as you can reverse the blade guard to cover the entire blade when it is being jostled around in your carry on or luggage.  I don&#x27;t know why anyone would use anything but a standard safety razor. Each blade is good for about a week depending how much and how often you shave. The only difference I find between this and a modern multi-blade razor is that it may take you a little while longer to shave.  Worth every cent saved!!!</li>
    <li> This is perfect for hubby since I am sick of buying him those 20 thousand blade razors that need to be replaced all the time which cost a fortune. This works better than the new tech, he gets a closer shave.</li>
    <li> Although I bought this razor almost four years ago, I wanted to write this review due to an exceptional customer service experience.  The razor itself is excellent with a solid feel and very simple design.  Changing blades is very easy and there is nothing to adjust.  The razor is made of stainless steel (except for the top that covers the blade, this is chrome plated) and still looks like new after four years of use.  Recently I dropped the razor accidentally and I was unlucky that the chrome top got dented in one corner.  I managed to sand down the dent with fine sandpaper, but it did not look nice and started corroding.  I contacted the manufacturer of the Merkur products in Germany by email (DOVO Solingen, if you Google you will find the website and customer service email address) to ask where I could order a replacement part, but they just send me the part by mail for free!  A week later I received the part and my razor is as good as new again.  Still very happy with the razor and now also with the customer service of DOVO!&lt;br /&gt;Notes:&lt;br /&gt;1. For blades I have used for the past four years the original Merkur Double Edge Safety Razor Blades.  They were rated high at the time and worked well.  They were also very long lasting for me (at least 20 shaves with a single blade).  As a result I only recently needed to look for new blades.  I ordered Astra Superior Platinum Double Edge Razor Blades based on reviews and the fact that I could order a relatively small quantity (30 blades for about $8 including shipping).  The Astra&#x27;s are very good: they pull much less and allow me to shave much closer than the Merkur.  No nicks or cuts at all.  I do not know yet about the durability (only shaved three times with them so far), but the comfort and closeness of the shave are superior to the Merkur blades.&lt;br /&gt;2. For shaving soap I used Proraso first.  This lasted very long for me (more than 2 years).  After that I tried Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream, which was nice, but lasted only about a year.  I am going back to Proraso now.&lt;br /&gt;3. My brush is a Omega 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush that I have used since 2009.  No problems and works well to create a nice lather.  I keep it in a stand brush down when not in use to allow it to dry properly between shaves.ich was nice, but lasted only about a year.  I am going back to Proraso now.&lt;br /&gt;3.

    <li> I have no problem with this razor. I like the weight and the length of the handle. It appears to be made of a good quality steel and gives a close shave without any problems.</li>
    <li> I did not know if I would like the screw together type razor over the butterfly style, but I gave it a try and am very impressed. This is good quality razor and if properly cleaned and maintained will last many years. Had a butterfly before but have since retired it.</li>
    <li> The razor really is a beautiful piece of craftsmanship. My only complaint is that the shave isn&#x27;t as close as using a standard Bic disposable razor. My five o&#x27;clock shadow definitely returned sooner, but the financial savings are worth it, ultimately.</li>
    <li> For those of you using disposable or cartridge razors, do yourself a favor and dispose of them. Just buy a safety razor--seriously. The Merkur Model 180 is inexpensive, low-maintenance and (like any safety razor) the best shave you can get short of a straight razor (and--as the name implies--substantially safer). Changing blades is easy and I haven&#x27;t had a single issue with this razor. My beard grows fast and I shave often, so this is a godsend. My only minor concern is that the chrome surface is easily gummed by shaving cream residue unless you really scrub it down after each use. Won&#x27;t affect your shave, just a cosmetic thing--and who cares about that?</li>
    <li> Quick service-exactly as described.</li>
    <li> The long handle is the perfect size for my large hands, excellent balance. Very high quality material, no corrosion or defects. Works perfectly.</li>
    <li> This is my first DE (double edge) razor.  I got tired of paying the high price of Gillette.  The shave is ok - sometimes it is on par with my old 3-blade system - sometimes it&#x27;s not.  I go seem to get a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow more often.  This razor seems very heavy compared to my old system - so i&#x27;m looking around for a lighter DE razor.  I think i&#x27;m sticking with this DE thing - it shows promise.</li>
    <li> good razor-gets you back to basics. with proper face preparation, you get a close shave. i expect this to be the last razor i purchase.</li>
    <li> Well made, but blade changes are not as convenient as they would be with a butterfly or flip-top design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this razor, you have to completely unscrew the handle and lift off the top to insert blades.</li>
    <li> My husband was active in the Coast Guard for years and when he landed his professional civilian job, he was bummed to find he had to start shaving again. It was a tedious task and he always felt like it was humiliating. After doing some research on gifts, I found shaving soap and shaving brushes and ordered them as stocking stuffers. I figured that a good soap and making shaving classier would help change his opinion on it. It worked, he was having fun using the brush giving him a vintage, classy and very manly feel about shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For his birthday I decided to step it up a notch and ordered him this Merkur and a set of blades. His reaction was priceless. He always assumed that I meant a straight razor when talking about old school shaving methods. This did the trick. He says it&#x27;s the smoothest shave he&#x27;s ever gotten and that he rather enjoys shaving to the specific way his hair grows vs combing over it several times with one of those expensive disposable razors. In the long run it will save him LOTS of money on those disposables as you can get a pack of ten blades for barely the cost of a single cartridge, and the research says that one of those blades can last a year depending on usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely going to be a keeper and it&#x27;s made his morning routine much more pleasant.</li>
    <li> This is supposed to be a safety razor?  I expected it to open up like a butterfly, like my dad&#x27;s used to do.  This does  not.  You have to take it apart to put the razor in,and to shave you have to screw it loose to use the blade which renders it wobbly and unstable.  When it is screwed tight you can&#x27;t shave with it.  The blade is completely covered.  Am I missing something?</li>
    <li> This is a great gift for someone who does not like plastics and is wants something that is can be reused.</li>
    <li> Full disclosure: I am a first time user of a safety razor at just shy of 40 years old.  This thing worked great. I used a Personna blade for my first shave and it was awesome.  I don&#x27;t know how to describe a shave as an &amp;#34;experience&amp;#34; but this was just that.  Shaving with this razor vs.  my usual 5 blade razor is completely different.  I had to take my time, rinse the razor a lot, and pay attention to what I was doing.  It was cathartic.  Man-style alone time.  I like the long handle and the weight of it.  Seems to be well very well constructed.  I switched to this type of razor to quit spending a gazillion dollars a year on cartridge blades and after one shave I am sold.  I will not be going back. Highly recommend shaving using this razor and Taylor of Old Bond Street Jermyn.</li>
    <li> I have own mine for about a month and i can say its the closest shave i have ever gotten using it and feather blades. Technique must be developed which should be in around 4 shaves and it should be somewhat slow. I was cutting myself pretty bad due to the speed i was using,  if you do it slowly you will get the best shave ever.</li>
    <li> I am enjoying the razor very much. I am glad that I purchased the 7 o&#x27;clock razor sampler with the razor as I was not as happy with the Merkur razor blades  that came with the razor. The sampler pack allowed me to determine which  blades worked best for me with this razor. Definitely recommend both.</li>
    <li> Used this for a few weeks to prepare myself for the switch to a straight razor.  Honestly, this gives (with feather blades) almost as good of a shave without the whole &amp;#34;cutting your throat&amp;#34; worries.  Great product, great construction.  I&#x27;ve since gone to a shavette straight razor, but I still use this for travel just for convenience.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant at first to try a safety razor, but after trying it I am a absolute believer I have never had such a close and comfortable shave!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to shaving like men were meant to so I don&#x27;t have much to offer by way of comparison. However, so far this thing feels and performs great. It feels nicely balanced and has just the right heft. No blood drawn so far.</li>
    <li> I dont ever really write reviews for products I buy on here, but this is one of the greatest purchases I&#x27;ve ever made in my life. I have a really sensitive face when it comes to shaving and I have spent YEARS trying out every razor, every shaving cream/soap/gel, every after shave lotion and weird little techniques. I spent 8 years active duty military and WISH i would have discovered safety razors while I was still in and shaving every single day. I have always had at least one cut on my face shaving, usually ends up bleeding FOREVER and ALWAYS had severe irritation from shaving and ingrown hairs. I got this Merkur safety razor and Personna blades and tried it out as a last ditch effort.. Needless to say I have been so thrilled about this decision. Does it take longer to shave? Yes, about twice as long. Is it worth it? Absolutely! My very FIRST shave with a safety razor and I didnt get a single cut, any irritation or any ingrown hairs the next day. I will never ever go back to using another type of razor again.</li>
    <li> Feels great in your hands. Good weight. Love the close shave I get with my Feather Titanium razors. Way better than any disposable.</li>
    <li> I ordered the long handle Merkur,and I thought the handle would be longer. It seems short,but the shave is okay. I have thick fingers,and I have used a longer handle,which feel better to me.</li>
    <li> I have had this for quite a long time now and am still using it as my only shaver. It works very well and as long as I am paying attention when I shave I don&#x27;t get any nicks or cuts. I have recommended this style of razor to friends that wish to save money. The razor is fairly easy to clean and I clean it with an old toothbrush every now and again just to keep it shiny. I am glad that I did purchase this and would recommend it to anyone else that wants to try out this style of razor.</li>
    <li> Much better than cartridge razors...not to mention, much cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;Product is very well made although my experience is only 4 weeks.</li>
    <li> love my murker 23c---- I also have a murkur 33c love them, best quality can get, thinking about another one</li>
    <li> I bought this razor as an upgrade from my Parker 71R.  I use the word Upgrade because that&#x27;s what it is.  Just shaved, and OMG I wil never go back.  This razor is very very forgiving, none aggressive, Excellent for beginners, Best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  No razor burn, no nics, very very nice razor, I cant say enough about it.  Best choice I have ever made about shaving besides going to wet shaving.</li>
    <li> I am just getting back into shaving with a safety razor and am really enjoying the experience.  I am a mid-50&#x27;s dark skinned white guy with a heavy beard infused with those tough grey beard hairs.  I love the renaissance movement among young men as well as us experienced guys of returning to classic shaving with a  real razor! After a few experiments, I settled on this Merkur 180 long handle razor, and finishing with the Dreadnought post shave balm, I have experienced the closest shave I have enjoyed in years.  I actually find myself rubbing my face throughout the day.  I feel well groomed, and after adding some classic after shave, it&#x27;s a great experience.  I have mid to large hands and found the long handle razor was easiest to me.  Shaving at a 30* angle, lathering up a second time and going against the grain provides a very smooth shaving experiences</li>
    <li> My Dad taught to shave on a safety razor a lot like this one, sans the quality metal and design.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure that his was either Army issue or a hand me down from my Grandfather.&lt;br /&gt;Quite simply the Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor is one of those rare instances in life where a simple function like shaving is enhanced by an elegant, well made tool designed to a specific purpose, designed, engineered and manufactured with an obvious commitment to quality not seen very often in today&#x27;s world.&lt;br /&gt;After years of various plastic throw away razors of various types, I opted to give the Merkur a try. Glad that I did!&lt;br /&gt;Not only is she a well-balanced blade, but a delight to use and an economic value! No longer will I toss away over $100 a year on disposable plastic razors, surely filling land fills with waste.&lt;br /&gt;I have returned to enjoying a leisurely morning shave the way a man was meant to, warm lather, hot towel and a nice sharp well-balanced blade.&lt;br /&gt;After about a month with the Merkur I decided to try an English razor, to see how my ancestral cousins handled engineering of a similar product. I purchased an Edwin-Jagger Faux Ebony Double Side Safety Razor for the office kit.&lt;br /&gt;Please see my separate review.</li>
    <li> This is a very well made product. It is easy to use. There was no cuts the first time I shaved with this (2 passes) and results were much better than the results I used to get with the expensive cartridges.</li>
    <li> The handle screw out of the base, meaning you have to take hold of the razor blade to remove and install another. Not exactly safe, because even if it&#x27;s too dull to shave your hair, it&#x27;s sharp enough to give you a nasty cut. There is a different style where two panels (by way of twisting the handle) open and close, allowing you to dump the razor in the garbage. This one&#x27;s got a two-piece top (three pieces total) that would fall in the garbage if you tried disposing of the razor that way. You also have to hold the razor at sort of a weird angle to get it to shave and I am convinced it&#x27;s this strange design that makes getting a close shave impossible. I&#x27;ll use up the blades I bought with this thing and then give it to charity or chuck it and go back to disposables, any of which shave better than this thing!</li>
    <li> This razor is my first double edge safety razor.  I wanted to go to a safety razor because I wanted a close shave without spending a ton on blades.  I have had this razor for a few months now and I cant find a single thing wrong with it.  I like the long handle because it makes it easier to hold when your hands are wet during shaving.  I like the solid three piece design.  It has a nice heavy feel to it. I cant see how a person could damage this razor, this one should last you a lifetime.    update - I have now had this razor for about a year and I still think it is awesome.  I never really did cut myself with it much but with practice I haven&#x27;t cut myself at all in at least six months.  Shaving with it has gotten a lot faster with practice too.  I also wanted to add that I have always gotten some irritation when shaving but I no longer have that problem as long as I only shave with the grain and across the grain with this razor.  I do still get irritation if I shave against the grain but this razor gets a close enough shave without having to go against the grain.  I think this razor will bring me many more years of good use.</li>
    <li> My first d/e razor was a Parker 91r. been using it for about a year, til i dropped it and broke. I was happy with the Parker, but I decided to get this Merkur to see what all the rave was about. Well, now I know. This razor is much more forgiving, I never knew how aggressive the parker really was until I tried this one. I wish I had used this one to begin with.</li>
    <li> I surprised my husband with this for his birthday and he absolutely loves it. No more disposable or cartridge refills for him!</li>
    <li> Have been using this razor now for 3 weeks now and I love it.  I use it with[[ASIN:B000MXGMHU Col. Conk World&#x27;s Famous Shaving Soap, Bay Rum]], [[ASIN:B000G647Y8 Tweezerman Shaving Brush]] and [[ASIN:B002OXPYWA Shark Super Stainless Razor Blades]] and together they give me one of the smoothest shaves I&#x27;ve had since I started shaving (I&#x27;m curently 30 y/o), even along the jaw line.  The razor is a completly difrent tool then the disposable or cartrage razors so it dose take about a week or so to get used to but once you do you will never want to go back.  I tried it first with the can of shaving gel I used with my fusion recomend and I highly recomend geting a good old school shaving soap and brush.  Buy this you wont be sorry.</li>
    <li> This is my first DE safety razor, so I have nothing to compare it to other than a mass marketed Mach 3 that I have used for many years. I have found the Merkur to provide a better shave so far, nice feel.</li>
    <li> While I am sure that this razor is an excellent product I have to return it because I have a very sensitive face and I nick etc. easily. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who has a normal non-sensitive beard. I am sure that it is a great razor. I have returned it for a Merkur which is hopefully less aggressive.</li>
    <li> It took a few shaves to get used to it and to feel safe with it, but after I bought a set of Astra razors, I&#x27;m amazed how good this things works.  I even use it to shave my head, and have only good results.</li>
    <li> Just started using a safety razor.  This has been a great razor to learn the tricks of the trade with.</li>
    <li> After trying this thing for a few months I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that the whole single edge thing is overrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got to the point that I could shave rather quickly without cutting myself, and I tried maybe 6-7 different blades, but it is much more irritating than the triple blade razor I used to use (mainly because you have to go over spots several times), it doesn&#x27;t give near as close of a shave, and it takes longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moment I went back to the Mach 3 I had the closest, fastest, most-comfortable shave I&#x27;d had in a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And this silliness about what your dad or grandpa shaved with being superior???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mean come on, so humans are 200,000 years old people are arbitrarily picking a time period approximately 30-60 years ago of the 200,000 years to pick from as the epitome of shave technology. As if in the 1950&#x27;s they&#x27;d mastered shave equipment manufacturing and it stopped evolving and it and it all went down hill from here. It&#x27;s nostalgia and hype. What they have to offer now is better, faster, and more convenient than these. I mean if you want to go back in time, shave with a sharpened piece of quartz, I&#x27;m sure early man mastered that at some point, but it doesn&#x27;t make it ideal That is an illogical conclusion.</li>
    <li> So far so good. I&#x27;ve only shaved with it once. Way easier and nick-free than expected. Actually, it was a flawless shave. I get a worse cut from my go-to razors on a good day. People say that it&#x27;s aggressive? Not for me. It was a great time. It was a pussycat shave in the best way. Felt very smooth after. But later that night I had sharper, more pronounced stubble than usual, at least that quickly. Either it didn&#x27;t cut as close as my usual disposable or it cut even closer causing my hair to grow out faster...? Just an observation. I thoroughly enjoyed the cut it gave and the ease of the whole process. It made me feel old-school vintage and I enjoyed that more than anything. NOTE - It only comes with one blade. Will be buying more blades to make it my go-to shaver. Awesome purchase.</li>
    <li> Awesome! Shaved my head for the first time and it worked perfectly. Easy to use and effective. I will not use the modern razors ever again.</li>
    <li> Hard to get use to. Went to Big Sensitive instead. Did not feel like I was cutting any hair with this. Maybe I did not practice enough, I know everyone says there is a learning curve...</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for, but I got a more than what I paid for with this Merkur. I&#x27;ll admit it, I&#x27;m a cheap bastard. A cheapskate, maybe; looking for the most cheapest bargain I can find yes. Have been using a Parker for the past 3years now, it does what it&#x27;s suppose to - and that is to keep my bald head hair free. But decided to go uptown a little and got this Merkur (as well as a free Merkur Super blade). The difference between the two DE razors were night and day. Granted that the Parker was a butterfly open and the Merkur was a 3-piece, don&#x27;t know if that makes a difference? Anyway, long story short - get yourself a well crafted DE safety and leave the cheap ones behind. Will be buying Merkur blades from now on as well. Less gashes and cuts on your scalp is always a good thing and looking good for the ladies is a much better thing. From a cheap bastard.</li>
    <li> Great beginner safety razor. I recommend the longer handle, since it&#x27;s thinner and of course longer. It&#x27;s harder to use for, say, shaving your head. . . But it works great .</li>
    <li> Alright, here is another review for the ladies. I bought this almost fully expecting to have one horrible shaving experience with it and then gift it to my husband. Boy was I wrong, this thing is fabulous! I think a little background info is helpful so here goes-I have super sensitive skin. Shaving has always been a risky proposition due to razor burn and I&#x27;ve always used the biggest and baddest disposable blades technology had to offer. I was very skeptical of the whole DE Safety blade thing for women, let alone those of us with sensitive skin but I took the plunge anyway. It arrived earlier today and I just hopped out of the shower after my first shave with it. The closeness and quality of the shave is at least as good as what I was getting previously with my $5 disposable blades. I did not cut myself at all-even in all the difficult spots like behind the knees, ankles, etc. I shaved against the grain like I normally do but I did modify my technique somewhat in that I took very short strokes and many more of them (no single swipe up the whole leg-at least not yet), I used shaving gel which I normally don&#x27;t, and I used almost zero pressure and really let the razor do its thing. So, for a first timer it maybe took me an extra 5 minutes but, honestly, who cares. If I can be successful with this type of razor, anyone can. Hope this helps some of the women out there considering this!</li>
    <li> love the razor I think it&#x27;s really a good razor</li>
    <li> I like it but razors are not for my skin type, I wish it was cause I love a smooth shave but afew days later and my face bumps up not the razors fault it&#x27;s how my skin is.</li>
    <li> Works waaaaay better than any Mach 5 or any disposable i&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;ve been using it for months now and still on the original razor</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so obsessed with this razor. It took about a week to get a good rhythm with it but now I prefer it to a disposable. I used to get really bad rashes and razor burn but I haven&#x27;t since I started using this one. Also the replacement blades are cheaper than buying disposable razors but with proper care you won&#x27;t have to replace your blade for a very long time.</li>
    <li> Bought for my son.  He loves it.  Gives a clean shave</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a non-electric razor, this is a good way to go. While not as handy as one of those plastic disposable ones, it sure beats them in economy and in ecology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, a long term supply of blades with this is a much smaller package than those other ones.</li>
    <li> I must speak out.  When razor blades with 3 or 4 blades reach around five bucks a pop, something needs to be said.  My I be so bold as to contend that anyone paying that ransom for a good shave, is a fool.  Please try a single blade, well made and time proven.  I am blessed with the kind of hardy skin and light whiskers that all my relatives have, and yet I have had it with the current rip-offs currently being pushed off on us.  This single blade razor is just as good and maybe better than the three blade I was using, and now refuse to buy anymore.  It&#x27;s as if when I quit smoking I suddenly had more money in my wallet.  Same deal.  Go buy yourself a fine leather jacket with the money you will save.  I plan to.  This time it&#x27;s not tea we throw in the drink but overpriced razors!</li>
    <li> Are you still being sold on the idea that a \\&quot;12 blade razor will strip your face off leaving behind a baby&#x27;s butt soft, hot chick kissable surface\\&quot; BS? Grow up and be a man like our grandpappies before us. I am one hairy man. I grow facial hair faster than we increase the population. I even shave my head. That is why I am so glad I discovered something that has been around for a long time. the cost of replacing blades on this thing is amazingly inexpensive. No plastic crap to throw away, just a sliver of metal. The smooth shave I get can&#x27;t be beat by those ultra-mega-extreme wastes of money multi-blades. If I do get lazy and have to whack a bush by the time I use this, I simply hit it with my clippers real quick and BAM! I&#x27;m good to go. If you are a man... a REAL man, you will have one of these in your man-bag! Fathers, teach your sons how to be a real man.</li>
    <li> I thought it&#x27;d be a cheap razor but it&#x27;s really nice, good quality, comes with a blade</li>
    <li> This is a great safety razor.  I started shaving with similar razors at age 14.  This by far is the best.  Forget all the triple and quadruple razors that are being marketed these days.  This or nothing.</li>
    <li> The razor is nicely constructed and works well, but the guard is rather large. This is my first safety razor so it might be that I don&#x27;t know how to use it properly, but the guard makes it difficult to get a close shave.</li>
    <li> Great double-edge. It&#x27;s not too aggressive and it works as it should.</li>
    <li> this razor is the bomb I&#x27;m 30 I&#x27;ve gone through that many different razors looking for the perfect one and i found it</li>
    <li> Great razor. Didn&#x27;t shave for 4 days, got a nice scruff coat and then used this for the first time. Never used one before but no nicks at all. Only con to me is the handle is a little short for my hand</li>
    <li> I am a long time user of a 5 bladed razor system.  I occasionally get redness and bumps on my neck and read reviews that a safety razor can help prevent this so I tried this.  Let me tell you, after using the 5 blade disposable head system for many years, I just cannot get the safety razor system to work for me.  I look like I got in a fight with a cat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the 5 blade system I occasionally get a nick here or there but only maybe once a week or less.  With the safety razor I have nicks and cuts all over my face and neck.  And believe me, I really wanted this to work for me.  Safety razors are much cheaper than the 5 blade disposable heads!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this razor for about a month until I just couldn&#x27;t take it any more.  I used very light pressure and made sure to keep the blade lightly against my skin but I just could not get a close and nick free shave.  In the end I went back to the disposable head system.  That just works better for me.</li>
    <li> After 10+ years of throwing money into Mach III cartridges, thought I&#x27;d go old school and gave this razor a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it! Maybe once a month when shaving half asleep, i&#x27;ll nick myself pretty good. Otherwise, closest smoothest shaves ever.</li>
    <li> I never knew why I had adult ache until hearing a story on Marketplace about a condition that is caused by hairs that are cut too close to the skin.  I started using these blades, along with a good aftershave and I no longer look like a horny 15 year old.  For those that this might help, I use the Personna Double Edge Razor Blades, plus the Proraso soap, and Proraso aftershave (which I add tea tree oil to when I get it), and I am now 99% ache free.  I sincerely hope this helps someone.  I can&#x27;t understand why my doctors couldn&#x27;t tell me that I was cutting the hairs on my face too short.  I tried regular razors, electric, etc, but found that the safety razor is what I should have been using all along.  Good luck and happy shaving!!</li>
    <li> It has been a long time since I tried a safety razor with replaceable blades and decided to give this Merkur a try.  Although others have said other models are heavier and better, I think this one is SO much better than all of those 3, 4, 5, X blade razors I had been using that I REALLY like this thing.  I have only used it twice and so far no nicks, scrapes or cuts AND the most amazing thing is after shaving neither me nor my wife recognizes that it is MY face that we are feeling and there is no longer a pavement of hairs left over and my skin is smooth.  That is with the regular gel shaving cream I had been using before and would still like to try a real brush and shaving soap to complete the permanent [underlined] transition away from those skyrocketting prices for trendy but MUCH poorer multiblade razors of all types and from any company you might want to name............tried them all and now never again</li>
    <li> I decided to give a safety razor a shot so went ahead and purchased the Merkur Safety Razor due to all the reviews it had. I&#x27;m glad i did.  Shaves exactly how i like. No issues with it at all and it shaves better than any of the 2, 3, 4, 5, bladed razors out there. It&#x27;s like have 2 razor&#x27;s in one. I can actually shave half my face with one side, flip it over and shave the other half without having to run it under water every few seconds. So far, the blade that came with it has lasted for over 2 months. I experimented with my Gillette 3 bladed razor to see if I could go a year without changing the blade (I believe razor/blade companies tell you to change them often to keep you buying more razors/blades) and although it was beginning to pull more than cut it was still usable and still gave a close shave. I did that for 2 years then went to changing them out every six months. A package of 8 blades has so far lasted me about 5 years. I just put the last blade on the Gillette razor which I only occasionally use when taking a trip. The box of 100 blades I bought with this razor should easily last me the rest of my life!</li>
    <li> Good for the novice to single blade safety razors. I practiced a few time without the blade in to make sure I got the angle correct. First time shaving with this and it was nice and smooth. Take your time and you shouldn&#x27;t have any nicks</li>
    <li> This is a top-of-the-line, quality made product.  The classic design and quality materials make it easy to use and easy to keep clean.  You&#x27;ll never get a better shave than with a safety razor!</li>
    <li> After using a multi-blade razor for many years, this was a bit of a change. Honestly, I like the simpler design and how easy it is to clean. Granted, you have to be a bit more careful when using this razor, but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> I made the mistake of buying the longer handle but overall a good buy and very nice</li>
    <li> I had tried many different kinds of razors like Mach 3 etc. I never found a razor I liked until I tried this one. I use it with persona blades and I am saving a ton of money.</li>
    <li> Awesome razor. I will never go back to the garbage multibladed pieces of crap i was use to. one simple blade can last you 10x as long as a razor priced 10x as high. Sure the handle is expensive up front. but its absolutely worth it. the blades last longer too. just make sure you let the weight of the handle do the cutting. its very easy to jodi arias your face up if you treat it like the plastic throw aways or the multiblade gillette razors.</li>
    <li> The Mr. says:  shaves close for a fraction of the cost of commercial razors.  Makes you feel more manly, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Mrs. says:  doesn&#x27;t get in the tight spots (like underarms) very easily.  Sliced badly on the shins, but did fine overall.  Surprisingly close shave, otherwise.</li>
    <li> This is the best thing I could have ever bought my husband. It&#x27;s also the best razor either of us have ever owned. I bought this over a year ago and I have yet to have any issues with it. No rusting. Nothing.&lt;br /&gt;Ladies, I strongly encourage you to buy this razor. Not just for your man, but for yourself too! You won&#x27;t get a closer shave with a disposable razor and you&#x27;ll save yourself tons of money because you won&#x27;t have to buy the disposables any more.&lt;br /&gt;This works well on legs, armpits, and even the bikini area.&lt;br /&gt;It also gives my husband a smoother shave than any other razor he&#x27;s used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of it&#x27;s effectiveness depends on the type of blade you use as well. We bought a huge variety pack and still haven&#x27;t gone through them all, even after a year.</li>
    <li> This has got to be the best purchase i have made all year. Great shave, well made, and the double-edged razors you replace cost about a quarter. This is not only a great product but it will save you money in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;Using this is also great for your skin. I used to get terrible razor bumps using my old disposable razors but now theyre a thing of the past. Also, using this makes you feel even mnlier than before. Great, great product - go buy one now.</li>
    <li> After spending three decades scraping the skin (and maybe a few whiskers) off my face with fancy, over-priced, multi-bladed razors that seem to perform worse (even though each modern improvement claims to provide \\&quot;the best shave yet\\&quot;) ... I decided to go back to basics and give one blade a try.  Unfortunately, old-school shaving has become a cult in and of itself and the cost of a quality double-edge safety razor is somewhat of an investment.  Looking to maximize my initial investment, I opted to arm myself with the MERKUR LONG-HANDLED SAFETY RAZOR before entering the grooming time-warp to my father&#x27;s younger years.  I&#x27;m three weeks into my voyage and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be returning to the world of modern razors that look more like left-over props from Star Wars movies and don&#x27;t do much more that drain my bank account when the blades need to be replaced after a few shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHY THIS PARTICULAR RAZOR?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The long, knurled handle - I find longer handles provide a more assured grip and better control especially considering the head (the part that holds the razor blade) is the heaviest part of the razor (the weight proportion is opposite that of the modern cartridge razors).  The long handle is also great for those with larger hands.  Initially, I felt the handle of this razor was too thin for me, but it didn&#x27;t take long for me get comfortable with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It&#x27;s German ... yeah, I know, so what?  Well, Germany DOES have a history of making quality steel products ... it&#x27;s a fact.  This razor is like a BMW, Mercedes or Tiger tank for your face ... stainless steel with chrome finish ... well-made and looks \\&quot;sharp\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Simple design:  3 separate parts that merge into one solid device.  Top of shell of razor has a screw that holds bottom shell when its screwed into the handle.  A substance over style device with no breakable gadgetry like a handle-twisted butterfly mechanism for blade changing.  Ironically, the bottom of the handle appears to have a ring that gives the appearance of a twistable device ... and I lost a few skin cells from the knurling before I realized the joke was on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. No comb - a personal preference ... I don&#x27;t feel I need one.  I lieu of a comb, there&#x27;s a safety bar which probably makes this a great starter DE safety razor ... less blade exposure &#x3D; less likely your bathroom will look like a horror movie film location while you&#x27;re acclimating yourself to the DE safety razor experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Affordable quality ... this razor is not \\&quot;cheap\\&quot;, but it is certainly a more moderately priced instrument.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, purchasing my first DE safety razor was an exercise in cost/benefit analysis ... I didn&#x27;t want to spend too much on something that I was not sure would work for me.  Then again, when you add up all the replacement cartridges, cans of shaving cream and face balm needed from planning your face with five blades at a time ... the long term savings are definitely worth the initial outlay for a decent DE safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;I am hooked on the DE safety razor experience and I simply love the MERKUR LONG HANDLED razor.  Shaving used to be an aggravating necessity ... not any more.  My daily shave ritual has been shifted to the evenings, so I can spend a little more time and care needed to get the extra close shave I&#x27;m seeking.  In addition to being both relaxing and enjoyable (by letting the weight of the razor do all the work), I happen to be getting the best shaves EVER.  In fact, my face reveals less stubble in 24 hours after using this razor than it did 4 or 5 hours after using the modern 5-blade razors ... and I haven&#x27;t chopped my face to pieces even once!  This razor handles extremely well, blade replacements are easy and I look at shaving in a whole new light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the razor is the primary instrument, like a car, it needs to be supplemented with other stuff in order to make it work:  Double-edge blades (for $10, you can get up to a year&#x27;s worth of blades), decent shaving cream (skip the cheap aerosol stuff, your face will appreciate it) and I would definitely recommend a storage device for used blades (they&#x27;re cheap and worth every penny).  For those who want more of a shaving \\&quot;experience\\&quot;, go all out and add a quality shaving brush, but be forewarned, the trial and error process of generating a good, creamy lather with a brush can be frustrating.  The razor does not come with a storage container ... I found a little jewelry bag works well to store it when traveling, but I plan on purchasing a stand for my bathroom (I&#x27;m taking the \\&quot;all-in\\&quot; approach).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually laughed when I saw a shaving store in an upscale mall a few months back, wondering how a store catering to such a thing could survive ... now I know.  I have absolutely no interest in going back to the shaving junk being peddled on television every night.  The MERKUR LONG HANDLED razor has proven to be not only a wise purchase, but an investment for my face.ear&#x27;s worth of blades), decent shaving cream (skip the cheap aerosol stuff, your face will appreciate it) and I would definitely recommend a storage device for used blades (they&#x27;re cheap and worth every penny).

    <li> I bought this razor because I wanted to try something new.  I had been using the Gillette Fusion ProGlide for years and it is a great product but as a black male, we tend to get ingrown hairs.  A friend of mine turned me on to the Bevel system which uses a safety razor which has great benefits but I didn&#x27;t want to be locked into the monthly subscription that it requires (If I run out of shaving gel, I don&#x27;t want to have to buy more razors and aftershave just to get shaving gel).  I already like the shaving gels and after shaves I was using (SheaMoisture, King of Shaves) but I was looking for the benefits of a safety razor, specifically not having my hair cut below the skin like multi-blade razors do.  This blade does not cut my skin like the multi-blade razors sometimes do and it gives me a very close shave without re-opening any abrasions my skin had.  I would highly endorse this product if you are looking for a better experience with shaving.  Not to mention, buying replacement blades is considerable cheaper and you get more for your $.</li>
    <li> Great Razor. I had used Mach 5&#x27;s for years. The cut on the straight with this razor is not as close, but I no longer suffer from ingrown hairs and razor burn. The price savings of using these are also huge. I doubt that I will ever go back to one of the multi bladed razors.</li>
    <li> Not as effective as a 4 blade razor. It is cheaper on the whole for blades, but you will not get a very close shave. I like the nostalgia of it, but if I really need a close shave I end up doing it twice. I take off the bulk with this fancy razor, then get it closer with Gillette. I suppose it could save money in the long term by using the cheaper blade to do the bulk work, but it is very time consuming. If I don&#x27;t want my girlfriend&#x27;s face to be pink after kissing, I still need to use an expensive blade.</li>
    <li> So far all I can say it gets the job done. Comfortable to hold and well made. Enough weight to steady shaving but not too much. Since 2012 it&#x27;s been very reliable.</li>
    <li> Love it....... Call me old fashion.</li>
    <li> This might work for many people, as I see from comments, but does not work for me. Too many cuts on my face, even with very careful shaving.</li>
    <li> This razor is a excellent buy. I use the feather blades with it, and it gives a very clean/smooth shave. I love this product. The only complaint I have is that I wish the head of the razor was heavier. Other than that the razor is awesome. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Let me start that this is my first safety razor. I really like it. It is so easy to clean and pays for itself so quickly. It is all metal but does not seem like it will slip from my hands when I am shaving. I did nick myself a few times but I am getting better with it. I would highly reccomend this product.</li>
    <li> This razor works excellent with Merkur-Razor Double Edge Razor Blades: very easy to use, much better shaving experience than with any of the &amp;#34;modern&amp;#34; disposable over-priced shavers. Very satisfied...</li>
    <li> Just as advertised&amp;#62;</li>
    <li> Clean shave from a single blade.  Comfortable and &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34;!  Blade changes quickly and easily and old blade tucks away cleanly in the new blade container&#x27;s bottom.</li>
    <li> amazing product, wont be wasting $$ on disposables anymore!  really really worth it to anyone with thick beard hair. :)</li>
    <li> Nice weight and size.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor for my husband as he really misses the old school style! He loves it and uses it every time he shaves for a super soft feel and look! I will be ordering more razor</li>
    <li> i like this razor. after years of paying too much for mach 3 razors i decided to give safety razors a try. way cheaper and a better quality shave.</li>
    <li> This was part of a valentine&#x27;s day gift for my husband.  I selected this model because it was the most purchased model on Amazon. He initially said he would have preferred a razor with a butterfly opening, but upon further research came to prefer this one Ecuador it will prove more resilient over the long run.</li>
    <li> I had used several traditional razors in the past. This Merkur 180 long handle razor is the best razor I have ever used!</li>
    <li> I love the long handle, which personally gives me more control than the shorter razors.  I also have an ej 86 and this murmur is my favorite.  This is even more gentle that the ej 86!  I have not had a bad shave with this razor.</li>
    <li> this was my first double edged razor...I ordered it because there were SO many good reviews and I was glad I did...I&#x27;ve since ordered other razors to add to my collection, but I come back to the Merkur 180 (23C) on a regular basis.  It&#x27;s got just the right weight to it for me, and it handles easily on  my face.  Try some different blades to get the razor/blade combination that works best for you and with a little practice you will be getting some unbelievably smooth shaves!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor looks great, is well made and will last a lifetime.</li>
    <li> first time I&#x27;ve strayed away from the mach type razors....I did knick myself the first shave, but have had great success since....super close....quality is very solid and nice looking</li>
    <li> Thought the razor unfolded not to be taken apart to install the blade. Very dangerous to exchange blades. Not for a new shaver.</li>
    <li> Love this razor. Closet shave I have ever experienced I will never use any other razor system except this one. Thank you</li>
    <li> Best shave ever, I adapted to it from a normal Gillette in only about 2 shaves. I still used the shunned shaving cream from a can, but it still shaves amazingly. After being in the field for about 3 days, I look forward to a nice hot shave with this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;Heavy enough, but not too heavy&lt;br /&gt;cheap blades&lt;br /&gt;close shave without cutting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;Imported&lt;br /&gt;Have to disassemble to dry off the blade</li>
    <li> Decided to go old school. Razor my dad use to use. Glad I did. Closes shave i&#x27;ve gotten in a long time. Happy with this razor but I wish Merkur would have  provided more the one razor blade. Fast and on time delivery. Thanks Amazon/Merkur.</li>
    <li> The metal weighs comfortably on the tip of my fingers and there is enough friction to hold it steady. As a beginner DE blade user, I find no trouble shaving at all. No cuts so far. Keeping my fingers crossed.</li>
    <li> First safety razor Ive ever bought or used. I love it, takes some time to get the hang of it but when you do you&#x27;ll love it. Watched some videos on YouTube to learn a little more. I would recommend this!!! Save some money.</li>
    <li> The long handle is short.  The safety design is so good that in normal operation the blade can&#x27;t reach my skin.  The sulking shave is poor.  I had to start over again with the three blade I was trying to replace.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> The most closest shave EVER very nice quality. It is better than my moch 3 but it is as long as it which is awesome thanks for an amazing product 10 stars</li>
    <li> Great father&#x27;s day gift if your dad uses disposables. I got tired of the disposable razor blade model and shifted to buying a nice set with a few hundred razors replacements. I&#x27;m enjoy shaving more now and I&#x27;m never going back to disposable blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is presentable and high quality. I feel less wasteful with blades. I like the heft on the razor. I wish I would have made the switch a long time ago.</li>
    <li> This works great for me.  I use it with Personna blades.  My first time using a DE razor.  Shaving takes me about 2 minutes longer than with a cartridge razor, but costs a lot less.  It hasn&#x27;t converted me to a shavaholic like some guys, as I still don&#x27;t really consider shaving &amp;#34;fun&amp;#34;, but it works just fine for me.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for a loved one. I was skeptical at first if he would like it, being so young. But he says it is the best shave he has ever had and would recommend it to any man, young or old.</li>
    <li> Excellent razor. Great shaving experience! Will never use multiblade razor again.  No cuts so far either. Very smooth shave.  Definitely recommend</li>
    <li> I love this razor! It&#x27;s given me several close shaves in the first month of using it. I have had to get used to it, of course, having used a Gillette Mach 3 ever since I can remember. But the Merkur has been a breath of fresh air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get little or no razor burn and no little bumps on my throat like I used to. My skin feels smoother than ever after I shave with this razor. I did get a couple of nicks here and there, but I attribute that to my own lack of skill at using this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I use with the razor: Pacific shaving company&#x27;s pre-shave oil, Dreadnought shaving cream, Pacific shaving company&#x27;s post-shave moisturizer, Elite shaving brush.</li>
    <li> I understand if you would sell this product and not compare yourself to anyone else. But comparing yourself to Gillette and claiming that it can do a similar or better job is misleading. i tried both and there&#x27;s no way this razor can get close to Gillette, i gave myself 3 weeks to get used to it. i was bleeding like hell. the more you get used to it the faster you get but this does not change the fact that it is still a single blade that can not reach all areas (under the nose). I stopped using it after 3 weeks and reverted back to my Gillette where i could shave my beard in 5 minutes.</li>
    <li> A good price and a sturdy razor. Everything should be this simple &amp; made this well.</li>
    <li> Great razor. I really like it and happy to have purchase it but it&#x27;s not my favorite as it is to mild for me. Easy to use I understand why people call it a good razor beginer. This razor have work in &amp;#34;lot&amp;#34; of angle witouth cuting your skin. Also a probably good razor for zombi morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to feel a little more the blade on my skin and you really need to do a 3 pass shave to have a close shave. But even if you don&#x27;t feel the blade and it&#x27;s really smooth it&#x27;s give really good reasult with no irritation at all. A great first razor. At first a though the long handle should help me but now I should probably buy a bulldog version. You may also change the bottom of the head with the comb of the RazoRock Jaws (15$) to have a little more agressivity from this rasor and less from the Jaws so the complete well together. A good razor you can not regret to buy. I use it with winkinson blades as I&#x27;m waiting for a feather delivery.</li>
    <li> After 14 months of using this razor, I don&#x27;t know why ever shaved any other way.</li>
    <li> Looks great, feels great.</li>
    <li> After all I&#x27;ve read about Merkur DE safety razors, I had huge expectations about this razor. WHAT A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!!! I HATE the way you change the blade. It used to be at one time that you backspun the bottom part of the razor and the top opened up allowing you to take out the used blade, replace it with a new one, then close the top with the knurled turn-knob on the bottom. This cheap feeling razor requires that the top be disasembelled to change the blade. You have to take it apart. Several separate pieces. Yes, you have to Deal with separate, pieces and parts, change the blade, then reassemble all these loose parts. NOT what I would even think of doing while in the shower. Man, what I would give for Gillette to please go back to building DE safety razors like they used to. I can&#x27;t get Gillette so I&#x27;m keeping this piece of junk just because I want a DE safety razor and now I don&#x27;t trust ANYTHING else Amazon is offering. I sure thought Merkur would be. ITS NOT!!!!</li>
    <li> Read many reviews on all types and brands of safety razors before purchasing this one. Like many people, was tired of having to throw away my disposables, due to the fact that they seemed to give me the best shaves. Love this and would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> OMG, the best safety razor out there! You aren&#x27;t going to need anything else but this razor, loaded with some Feather blades, and you can still pass it on to your kids. You can spend a lot more money, but you won&#x27;t see anything simpler or more elegant than this.</li>
    <li> After going through many different disposable razors, I finally found a much better and more affordable way to shave. I bought this razor and 100 double edged blades for the cost of my disposable cartridges for one month. Which means within thirty days the razor pays for itself. But with the blades, you can make this last two years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Closest shave ever. Do not force it or push like one would with an ordinary razor. Need to use caution initially. Buy a brush and shaving soap. And remember to use hot water to avoid cuts.</li>
    <li> The product was terrible. I bought it for my uncle for his b-day. He tried it and it cut his face numerous areas and made his face look like he had a rash.  My uncle gave it back to me.  I then gave it to my husband. He tried it, he hated it.  Cut &amp; scraped his face.</li>
    <li> Very very simple. The durability of this razor is all in its simplicity. No pivoting points, no mechanical levers, no vibrating motor, no batteries, no clip to grab the blades, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a standard three piece Merkur safety razor. I&#x27;ve dropped it into my cast iron sink several times and not so much as a nick out of either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor also gives a great shave (mileage will vary of course). And despite my wet shaving addiction, I haven&#x27;t had any desire to replace it or upgrade.</li>
    <li> Let me preface my review by first saying that I shave in the shower with regular old face washing soap every other day. With that being said I was a little hesitant to try shaving with a DE safety razor after reading some of the reviews. I seemed to me that there was some sort of learning curve to them and it would take some time for me to learn to shave without making a bloody mess of my face! I did a lot of research on the right razor to use and I finally settled on this one. When I first opened the box I was surprised on just how heavy it is. Not bad heavy, more like good quality heavy with a brilliant chrome finish and a crosshatched textured grip. As for blades I went with the Gillette 7O&#x27;clocks(Good all round blade). For my first shave I went with the grain and then at a 90 degree angle to it. PERFECT, absolutely no reason to against the grain to get a really close shave. No cuts no nicks no fuss. I don&#x27;t really know what all the fuss is about, as far as I can tell there is no learning curve, no danger of bleeding out. This setup replaced my 5 bladed Gillette Fusion in one day. I use a razor blade twice then change it out, the blades are super cheap and most of the people complaining about cuts and nicks and irritation are probably dragging a dull blade against the grain (unnecessary) and I don&#x27;t care what you use that will set you up for failure every time! Do yourself a favor and buy this razor its cheap but well made, simple to use and you will love buying blades for pennies instead of 30 bucks for 4 blades!</li>
    <li> Great razor, better than a disposable. Is a good investment, with replacement blades available for a 100 at less than $10.</li>
    <li> My fiance had wanted to try this..so I bought it for him for apart of a Christmas present..He has very sensitive skin and typically can not shave without breaking out..This razor leaves his face so smooth! And he never breaks out afterwards... Love it!</li>
    <li> When I decided to stop spending large amounts of money on Gillette razors with four five blade refills, I turned to using a double edged razor. By chance I picked the Merkur Model 180 because it was not an open razor, meaning it had a guard and was less likely to cut my face open while I was shaving.  When I received this safety razor I was very impressed.  The Merkur was simple to use and replace the razor blade.  The Merkur gave me a very close shave.  The long handle is nice too.  I then picked up a safety razor/brush stand.  I am very happy and satisfied with the Merkur Model 180 Safety Razor.  It was well made.  I am saving a large amount of money now that I only spend about 10 cents a blade, instead of spending $3.00 on a Gillette replacement cartridge with four or five blades.  Thank you Merkur!</li>
    <li> When I started out with safety razors I decided to pick up a decent inexpensive razor and a sampler blade pack. This model has tons of good reviews and so I figured I&#x27;d test it out. With a 3 pass and touch ups I can get a shave on par or better than my mach 3. The razor is simple to disassemble and clean. I&#x27;ve never cut myself just the occasional nick while learning to DE shave. Recently, I&#x27;ve gotten a few antique Gillette&#x27;s and found they give a much closer shave with fewer passes. If I had never used the Gillette&#x27;s I&#x27;d give a 4 star rating, however knowing some 80-60 year old razors will give a better shave and cleaner shave I just can&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I am finally shaving like a gentleman. I spent about 3 days reading comments and going over product ratings. To save you some time, here&#x27;s a list of the products I bought along with this razor. I have tried all these products, and I&#x27;m very satisfied with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- FS Black Brush and Razor stand (I read a lot of comments about stainless steel stands getting rust at the base. I was hesitant about a black stand and stainless steel razor but it matches perfectly! It also matches with my shaving soap bowl. Great quality product.&lt;br /&gt;- Edwin Jagger Rn46 Traditional Black Porcelain Shaving Soap Bowl With handle&lt;br /&gt;- Tweezerman Men&#x27;s Shaving Brush&lt;br /&gt;- 120 Crystal &amp;#34;SUPER +&amp;#34; Stainless Steel Platinum Coated Double Edge Safety Razor Blades A.K.A Israeli Personnas&lt;br /&gt;- Burt&#x27;s Bees Natural Skin Care for Men Aftershave, 2.5 Fluid Ounces (Pack of 3) (I read some comments about the skin getting too oily. My skin is very oily and I still use a lot of it. Just let it soak into your skin.)&lt;br /&gt;- Proraso Shaving Cream Tube</li>
    <li> Truth told, this is a piece of art that also functions as a shaving utensil. The blade that was included almost scares me because I didn&#x27;t feel anything as I was shaving, but when I checked, beard hairs had definitely been severed from their stems. The only drawback to it is that, for my personal use, the razor isn&#x27;t as aggressive (shaves closer to skin) as my previous one. I was hoping for a more aggresive razor but I just switched out the head with my old one and its good to go. Still, I would definitely recommend it to any beginners who are afraid of scratching up their face.</li>
    <li> Solid good product.  No complaints, new to the double edge razor community.</li>
    <li> Excellent shave. Closer than modern razors. Does what the advertising said it would do.</li>
    <li> After three years of use with nothing to complain about I was shocked to see the metal cap covering the blade separate from the screw glued to it and expose the entire blade underneath. The fact that this defect occurred while the razor was in use shaving my neck is rather alarming.</li>
    <li> Nice weight and easy to change the blades.  I am new to the safety shaving thing having switched from Mach 3 blades.  I love that I don&#x27;t have the irritation that I always had with the Mach 3s.  The cost savings are incredible also.  Go with the feather blades and just be very careful as they are extremely sharp (duh).  Knock on wood I haven&#x27;t cut myself shaving with this and the feathers.  Don&#x27;t press like you have to with the mach 3 and get your face nice and hot before applying the soap, the weight of this is enough to get a great shave.</li>
    <li> This is my first of this kind and I have to say this thing is built so great. I used a Mach 3 before and this thing is more affordable and easy to use. The first time you use it though be careful look up videos on YouTube or check other resources online, much sharper and to an extent more dangerous. Don&#x27;t be afraid to make the switch.</li>
    <li> What a razor! What a blade! Smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt.</li>
    <li> This fine razor will beat any of those multi-blade shavers out there. I use to use those 4, 5 and 6 blade razors, and they just didn&#x27;t cut the mustard. The cost for re-fill blades was way to expensive, so I got this Merkur Razor and some Wilson single edge blades. I have already shaved at least a dozen times so far on the original blade that came with the razor. I&#x27;m amazed of the close smooth shave this razor gives. I would recommend this shaver 10 fold over any of those multi-money maker type razors. It looks like my wife has a whole bunch of razors and a few re-fills to use. Get smart and take the plunge and get one of these Merkur Long Handled Safety Razors. By the way, I&#x27;m 69 years young and I do remember the single edge razors when I was growing up. They haven&#x27;t lost there touch.... no pun intended. As a posted note, get a can of air and blow your razor dry after using / rinsing it clean. Loosen the tension on the blade,it keeps the blade dry and stays sharp a lot longer.</li>
    <li> I will never go back to disposable razors again.  These leave me with a nicer shave, less razors bumps, and for a heck of a lot less money.  Also, it&#x27;s retro factor is pretty awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleans easily, still looks new even after a year!</li>
    <li> surprised my hubby with and it is awesome - hard to buy for the old man, but I got kudos for this perfect gift</li>
    <li> I just recently purchased my first safety razor, the Merkur Model 180, and I&#x27;m very impressed with this razor and the old school experience of shaving this way.  The razor has a great looking and simple design that makes it easy to change the blades and clean.  This long handle model has the perfect weight and dimensions that allow me to easily get a good shave in.  I was hesitant about changing the way I shave after all these years, but after using this razor shaving has been a much more enjoyable experience. My face has not been nearly as irritated as it used to get with a regular three and four blade razor and shaving cream.  My face feels extremely soft and smooth after using the Merkur 180 and good brush. It&#x27;s a little bit of an investment up front, but I&#x27;m not paying a fortune for new blades in the long run.  I will never go back to the way I was shaving again.</li>
    <li> Guess I have used disposable razors too long, as this one now seems heavy and cumbersome!</li>
    <li> Decided to go back to safety razor shaving after buying my last pack of Fusion blades.  I&#x27;m not going to bash multi-blade cartridges if you like them but I can shave with a good D.E. safety razor just as well.  As long as you go at it smoothly, you can get a nice, quick, close shave with no nicks.  I change the blade about once a week and they always seem sharp.  Buy this razor, it shaves as well as the $50+ razors and you&#x27;ll be ahead on blade costs in less than 6 months.  Also help out the environment which is cool too!</li>
    <li> This is my first safety razor and I love it - I&#x27;m never going back to anything else. I recommend buying Feather razor blades and Proraso shaving lotion.</li>
    <li> Now I love shaving again! All the pros that other reviewers have listed are accurate. My only concern is that the starter blade seems to be a bit sharper than the Merkur 10-pack I ordered at the same time. Not sure yet if the difference is substantial...TBD.</li>
    <li> I wish I was introduced to wet shaving before. This is an extremele safe yet effective razor... I use it with the Astra Superior Platinum Double Edge razors and it works like a charm. I&#x27;ve tried different blades ( i.e Feather, Merkur and others) but the Astra are by far the best. When I kissed my girlfriend (for a second) it looked like a comercial, she was impressed with how smooth my face was (it was a little awkward haha) I am very happy I found wetshaving.</li>
    <li> I purchased this safety razor around four months ago and haven&#x27;t looked back since. Its weight is evenly distributed making it a breeze to shave. If you are looking for a safety razor, buy this one and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just gotten into DE shaving this year. My first razor broke when my roommate accidentally knocked it from its perch to the bathroom floor. So I ordered this from Amazon because it seemed decent.&lt;br /&gt;That was about four months ago. I have no complaints at all. The handle is long enough to be comfortable, and it feels very solid and well-put together.</li>
    <li> DE safety razors some in all shapes and sizes, some with short handles, others with longer ones.  Coming from a Gillette Fusion 5-blade, I wanted something that looked similar.  After reading reviews, I knew Merkur was one of the best brands, and I really liked the look of the 180 in particular.  I am happy to say that this is sturdy and made to last.</li>
    <li> 6 months using it and it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Worse razor I ever got</li>
    <li> AWESOME! I have been in the military for a while now (shaving every day) and I have never had a shave as close as this. Thank you! Has a good sturdy feel to it.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor mainly because I am very cheap when it comes to buying cartridges for standard razors.  I would go forever with the cartridges just because they cost so much to replace.  After finally getting tired of pulling hairs out, I found a possible alternative is to go old school with a razor like this one.  Blades are so cheap you can replace them once a week or so and always get the best shave.  So far its working out.  The first couple weeks are spent trying not to cut various parts of your face off, as well as figure out which way your hair grows so you can go the right way against it for the closest shave.  I have nicked myself a couple times, but its not too bad.  Unless you are a complete amateur you will be fine.  I still have a little trouble on details around a gotee or sideburns, but I&#x27;m getting better at it.  Just prepare to take a little more time for a while and let the razor do the work.  Learn your face, learn the correct angle and dont use a lot of pressure.  You&#x27;ll be getting just as close a shave as ever but for much less than cartridge razors.  I will vouch for the feather blades being some of the sharpest.</li>
    <li> These razors stay sharp much longer than a conventional disposable razor and on top of that it gives a better shave because it seems sharper than conventional razors. Don&#x27;t fall for the more blades is better marketing ploy, I say dutch the 10 blade razor and get this badass german designed little piece, you will be glad you did.</li>
    <li> I started shaving with this razor two tweeks ago and absolutely love it. It does take some practice, which I&#x27;m still working on, but it&#x27;s absolutely the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve long-suffered from razor burn, irritation and ingrown hairs on my neck; but, since starting with this razor I haven&#x27;t had any issues what-so-ever and actually feel MORE comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One suggestion: buy a styptic pen - stings like heck when you apply it, but it&#x27;ll stop those nasty bleeders right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00112WRB6 Clubman Pinaud Styptic Pencil Travel]]</li>
    <li> All the products are good.</li>
    <li> Awesome razor!!!!!! will never go back to the 3, 4 ,5 or 6 blade razors. best shave ever</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the very high reviews I saw when I searched for razors.  I tried several times and compared it side by side to my Mach 3 razors and the Merkur razor performed much worse: the shave was nowhere as close and I regularly got cuts on my face.</li>
    <li> Beautifully crafted. High quality, Good price, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Switched to this from the Mach 3 and have really enjoyed using it.  Hair is easy to rinse from the blade so you don&#x27;t have to deal with clogs.  Takes little time to get used to and have had zero issues with cutting my self.  I have always had problems with razor burn and this seems like it really helped.</li>
    <li> Awesome razor. Shaves much closer than the modern multi blade razors if today. Amazon did a great job of getting to me fast! My wife loves my smooth face!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many different kinds of razors with disposable cartridges and none of them have given me as close of a shave as this safety razor has. In all fairness, it does require a little more of my time because I do more than one pass but it&#x27;s worth it for the results.  I like that there are no moving parts, the design is simple, it feels solid (not flimsy) and it&#x27;s easy to change the blades. All that means it should be giving close shaves without any problems for years.</li>
    <li> Has a nice weight to it; you really feel it in your hand. Great appearance and style. Shaves great, comfy and not brutal. Would rather prefer a butterfly opening for loading and cleaning blades. Overall score, 4.5</li>
    <li> This four-inch razor is perfect and much better than my old 3.5 inch one. It is much easier to grab and use.</li>
    <li> Ive used this razor twice now and it works great. Ive never used a safety razor before and I didnt cut myself at all. No skin irritation or razor burn. Was extremely easy to use and didnt even take it slow like most other reviews say. Extremely happy with this product. Found 100 blades for 12 bucks. This is going to save me tons compared to the 3 blade razor i have been using</li>
    <li> I have been using this razor for about 7 weeks now and I don&#x27;t know what took me so long to get one of these DE razors. I use to use disposable razors years ago and as they started getting fancy with more blades I started following the trend. I never had a bad problem with razor bumps but I had my little share. Then I listening to my brother I went to Electric shavers. I own a Norelco 8140xl and a Braun 340s-4. I also owned a cheaper Norelco that I ended up giving to my cousin. I have used electric razors for a good 8yrs. The razor bumps decreased to just a few here and there and sometime none. Then I started getting tired of shaving for 20-30min to get all the hair off and I didn&#x27;t have much hair on my face. So I decided to go to the Gillette Fusion. I used it until it was time for new cartridge. That&#x27;s when I realized this is gonna get expensive.The money part isn&#x27;t a problem but it&#x27;s the fact that cartridges cost more than the razor. Way more. So I started reading reviews on DE Razors and start pricing DE Blades and decided to give it a try. So I purchased this razor for around $32 and bought a variety pack of blades. I noticed it cost more for the variety pack than if you buy one brand. I immediately noticed a big difference. First it doesn&#x27;t clog like disposables. So you just rinse it after a pass and you don&#x27;t have to bang it against the sink to unclog hairs like with disposables. It&#x27;s also easy to take apart and clean when your finished. Razor bumps are gone completely and my face is smooth as a babies bottom. Once you figure the angle your set and it&#x27;s easy. You don&#x27;t need to apply pressure because the weight of the razor against your face is plenty. As far as nicks and cuts I don&#x27;t get them. At first I got a few because I would accidentally apply too much pressure but it wasn&#x27;t nothing that a dab of astringent wouldn&#x27;t solve. I even shave my head with this razor. I use a separate blade just for my head and I spray a disinfectant after I clean it. Another thing I love about using a DE razor is that after I shave I can go outside and sweat and not feel my face burning. It&#x27;s like I never shaved. I recommend this razor big time. I have recommended this razor to several people. Don&#x27;t buy a cheap off the wall brand. I have read bad reviews on them cheap $2 razors.</li>
    <li> This has saved me so much money since I quit using disposable razors (and helped clear up my skin tremendously.)</li>
    <li> very good razor. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Like many others, I decided to go with a safety razor to cut down on breaking out from cartridge razors. After reading reviews, I decided this was the razor for me. It has great weight and balance, and allows for near-effortless shaving as its weight alone will move right along the contours of your face as you guide it. You will probably want to try out different blades, though. The blade that comes with this wasn&#x27;t for me. As far as blades go, I don&#x27;t know how to recommend them as each face is different. Astra blades have been good to me, though.</li>
    <li> I would never go back to disposable or electric shavers after using this. Blades are way cheaper and give you a closer shave as well. Combined with a good quality shaving soap, my sensitive skin never breaks out or gets razor burn like it used to.</li>
    <li> This is a very well weighted razor, it is my first DE and I am very pleased with it! I&#x27;ve used it multiple times and have yet to nick myself, it sits well in my hand, and works great</li>
    <li> It is what I expected. Back to basics with shaving. This should be much less expensive than buying Fusion replacement blades.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to safety razors, this is my first. I bought a variety pack of blades and I am delighted. I like the weight, I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
    <li> CLOSER SHAVE THAN ANYTHING I EVER TRIED</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay People say that the razor blade cuts deeper than the modern razor gillete cutters/shavers but this one didn&#x27;t do anything for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the modern razors actually cut my facial hair deeper than this one did, can&#x27;t say I didn&#x27;t try it though.</li>
    <li> The plastic ones would last about one to 2 weeks, maybe......And add it to the landfill.. This is my first single blade. It is great if you don&#x27;t want any cuts, with the safety...........But be gentle. it will cut !</li>
    <li> Very well priced, high quality safety razor. I switched over to safety razors from the &amp;#34;cartridge razors&amp;#34; a year ago- and I will never go back. Properly maintained; this product will last for a very, very long time. And the replacement razors are around .10 cents a blade for a quality product. The shave is closer, and my skin is much less irritated and prone to ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is phenomenal given what some razors are selling for these days. A similar product sold at any &amp;#34;boutique&amp;#34; store could set you back $100-$300! And the quality and function is the exact same! And remember: these razors have been around for 50+ years. The initial cost in the razor itself will MORE than cover itself in its longevity and the far cheaper price of the replacement razors. Forget paying around $2-$4 a replacement like the cartridge razors sold today- replacement razors for these cost around .5-.10 cents for a quality brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- With a safety razor, it&#x27;s all about balance, and not pushing firmly against your skin. The weight of the razor unit itself is sufficient to cut through whiskers for a clean shave. Hold the razor at the very bottom, hold it at a slight angle and let gravity do most of the downward motion. Contrary to some beliefs- you won&#x27;t slice a big chunk of skin off with these. Can you cut yourself? Sure, if you push down firmly on the skin or run the blade of the razor sideways. But they&#x27;re called &amp;#34;safety razors&amp;#34; for a reason. The technique isn&#x27;t hard to master- you&#x27;ll probably get it in your first try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Change your razor blade every 4-5 shaves, or whenever you feel it &amp;#34;pulling&amp;#34; more on your whiskers instead of easily cutting through them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The razor- like anything else you own, does require proper maintenance and clean-up. It doesn&#x27;t take long. Between razor blade changes: just slightly unscrew the top from the handle, that loosens the grip on the top and bottom holding the razor blade in place- and rinse it out with cold water. Screw the handle back on snuggly and give it a few shakes to loosen trapped water inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Every time you change your razor blade- wash each part separately and dry with a towel before reassembling. It&#x27;s not a tedious process and doesn&#x27;t take longer than a few minutes. Blow out the handle end with the threads to prevent rusting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s it! Just clean it up after each use and it should last you for many, many years. Longer than any cartridge razor setup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine is still in mint condition with no signs or wear or fault. It&#x27;s a great item made by a company with a good reputation.</li>
    <li> Has a non slip handle, easy to maneuver around chin and adam&#x27;s apple.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor because I used to use the Gillette fusion razor and it didn&#x27;t do the job. The replacement heads for the Gillette fusion cost a lot. So I decided to try this razor and I loved it! It cuts so much closer then the Gillette fusion ever did!! I recommend this to anyone, but the blades are razor sharp I knicked myself without realizing it.</li>
    <li> I have used this for many months now...i have very sensitive skin and electric razors made my skin burn and irritated.  I decided to try a blade razor again after many years of wishing I could find an Electric razor that worked for me.  I had a good Gillette Micron type of razor that many people loved, but it just didn&#x27;t seem to work for me.  I read the reviews and opted to try this razor...I am glad I did.  It works well, not fussy adjustments and feels good in my hand.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving with a straight razor for about two years. The weeks that I have to send the straight razor off to the sharpener leave me with my old Gillette Mach 3 (you all own one). Once you start shaving with a proper straight or safety, its just impossible to go back to those horrible three-to-forty blade face manglers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the interest of having something to use while the straight was out getting sharpened, and on the mornings when I am a bit rushed, I picked up the long handled Merkur. I love it. I love it enough that it has taken over Monday through Friday shaving duty, and I save the straight razor for the weekends when I can take my time and enjoy the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a lovely weight to it, and gets a really good clean shave. You do have to be a little careful with it, as it is a bare blade with just a little guard. I haven&#x27;t cut myself more than tiny nicks, but it is possible. You will generally want to do two passes to get a nice clean shave, but those passes are gentler on your face, and you can still move at pretty brisk speed once you have some practice with the razor. Finally, cheap cheap cheap to operate. Thirty dollar outlay, and then 3 dollars will get you a pack of ten cheap blades at a drug store (yes, there are better blades out there, but even the cheap ones do the trick). As soon as you have purchased your second 5 pack of face manglers, you have already exceeded the cost of this razor and a ten pack of blades, and you can use the DE blades for about as long as a cartridge.</li>
    <li> It does the job that the add said it would,</li>
    <li> This razor is solid well made and simple the bottom of the handle is turned to unscrew the top bezel where you place your blades.  Its got a nice chrome finish I have dropped it more than a couple times and it has not been damaged one bit.  One could look at this razor and think it a piece of nostalgia and art but I assure you it is truly utilitarian.  In my line of work I need to be clean shaved every shift on top of that I shave my head.  I was spending a fortune on multiple blade razors.  Mach 5 and what not.  No longer with blades like 7AM [[ASIN:B0017ZECA6 100 7a.m. Platinum Double Edge Safety Razor Blades]] Its cheap.  And as I said pure utility with the mach razors I found lots and lots of clogging of the blade I get absolutely none with this razor.  I shave my face and my head almost daily. The other thing I would add is that I only cut myself twice in the last 5 months since making the switch.  I am sure that with different face anatomy and what not you could find yourself getting cut more but I cant stress it enough. I wasted time and money thinking it would be to difficult or take to long.  I found the transition easy.  Truth be told I only cut myself when shaving my head and that was after a few months once I started to rush and got caught.</li>
    <li> I have always been a cartridge shaver or a disposable razor shaver. I&#x27;ve never tried electric shavers.  I was about to purchase a straight razor when I saw some info. on safety razors.  I went ahead and purchased the Merkur 180 safety razor, a badger hair brush, &amp; some shaving soap.  Today I shaved off my beard and used the equipment listed, and could not believe the close shave that I got.  To be honest, it was like an experience not drudgery.  First I prepared my beard by applying some warm water (applied with a hand-towel), then I applied the soap with the brush, and then finally started to shave with the Merkur letting the razor do the work.  It worked so well that I didn&#x27;t need a second pass across the grain, but I did it anyway for the practice.  I did nick myself once but it was because I moved the blade left to right just a little.  To sum it up... If you want the greatest shave and want shaving to be an experience, go with a safety razor and you will not regret it.  It&#x27;s not the fastest shave you can get but definitely is the best shave.</li>
    <li> This is a really great, durable, handsome safety razor. My husband really likes it. His only complaints is that the comb is not &amp;#34;aggressive&amp;#34; enough for his hair when shaving. I guess that means it does not cut as close as he would prefer. You can get safety razors with a more aggressive comb. This razor is a chrome finish and has been very durable. It is not too heavy for use. Overall, I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought a safety razor for two reasons.    1)  I was tired of spending ridiculous amounts of money on the multi-blade disposable cartridges that worked just fine but cost way too much (24 Fusion Cartridges cost $64 on Amazon; I bought 30 Derby blades for $6!)  2)  Safety razors brought back nice memories of watching my grandfather shave when I was a kid.    OK so the first reason is pure logic and the second is pure emotion...I&#x27;m schizo and so am I. I also thought about getting an electric shaver but a friend told me that shaving with a blade exfoliates your skin so it&#x27;s better for you than an electric shaver. Made sense to me.    The Merkur is beautifully made of the highest quality materials and workmanship. 5 stars for that. If I were to do this over again, though, I would probably pay more and buy one of the retro design Edwin Jagger razors with chrome accents and ivory handle. I love the Merkur but sometimes I can&#x27;t help but think that it looks like a precision surgical instrument. I don&#x27;t want to think about scalpels when I&#x27;m putting a sharp blade to the face!    So the cold clinical look of the device caused me to deduct one star...a purely subjective decision...flawless otherwise.    One more thing. Don&#x27;t let the other reviewers scare you into thinking that you need to buy a book or get a Ph.D. to use a safety razor. A monkey can do it. Also, don&#x27;t feel like you need to buy a lot of expensive lotions and oils to get a proper shave. My old can of Barbasol works just fine. No badger brush needed. But that&#x27;s just me (I&#x27;m retro, not metro). It&#x27;s just a razor, not a lifestyle choice!</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant to switch over from my Gillette Fusion to a Safety Razor. The long handle fits well in my big hands and has a real natural feel to it. I am still learning the do&#x27;s and don&#x27;ts of proper Safety Razor etiquette, paired with good shaving oils and lotions this product is spot-on.</li>
    <li> Very high quality razor. The blades are easy to take off and change. I would definitely suggest a stand to hang the razor on after use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to DE safety shaving and by no means an expert on razors. But this razor feels amazing for the $30 it costs. Heavy, well made and sturdy. I loaded it with a Gillette 7oclock blade and got a great shave. It rinses clean, feels great in the hand, not too heavy and by no means flimsy. If your just starting out with safety razors like me, this is a great place to start for a good price.</li>
    <li> I dont understand the 1 star reviewers - I have a very tough beard and the 4 and 5 blade fancy blades never gave a smooth shave. Some of my friends asked me whether I am using an old blade since I had a rough skin afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;After switching to Mercur and feather blades, the results were much better and at the end of the shave, it looked like a real shave for one tenth the cost. With Mercur razxor and feather blades , you cannot go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I am not a marketeer.</li>
    <li> My husband has an Edwin Jagger and although he likes the razor, he wished it had a longer handle.  I purchased this for him as it had great reviews and has the long handle he wanted.  This is now his everyday razor.  He says it shaves nicely, has a good weight, and feels he has better control now that the handle is a little longer.  He is very happy with this purchase and highly recommends this product.</li>
    <li> So I finally made the switch. I just couldn&#x27;t stomach throwing my money away to Gillette for their expensive 5 blade razors with the blue strips. This is my first safety razor and first adventure into wet shaving. So far I&#x27;ve been using regular gel but my shaving soap and brush will be shipped soon. I&#x27;m very happy with this shave so far. It takes a time or two to get used to, but overall I feel it&#x27;s better than the Fusion power option and I haven&#x27;t even bought the supposedly super sharp feather razors for this yet. I may invest in another more expensive option in a someday, but for a first time starter, this works great. Don&#x27;t delay, make the switch today and save some $$$$$ and get a better, more manly shave.</li>
    <li> The best shave I&#x27;ve had in years....way better than 3,4,5, and 6 blade razors with no razor burn or ingrown hairs...old school, who knew...</li>
    <li> Why didn&#x27;t anyone tell me about this razor before. Once you buy this safety razor you&#x27;ll never go back to disposable razors. Love it!!!! Plus it looks great on your bathroom counter.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for years for a shave technique to combat my foliculitis. I have razor bumps very bad and these new 5 blade jobs are too expensive and make the problem worse. I relearned how to shave with this razor. though it was a rocky start in just seven days of daily shaving my face is looking better. I also bought a cream and brush as well. I recomend this type of shaving to every man out there. it requires a bit more work and prep but it is well worth it.</li>
    <li> My husband was not keen on the idea of using one of these safety razors but I got one for him for fathers day anyway last year.He absolutely LOVES it. He says it is the best shave he has ever had. He was so happy that this fathers day I got one for my father. Lets see what he thinks ;) Next my brother!</li>
    <li> I like this razor.  The shave quality is about the same as the seven-bladed Gillette monsters, but the replacement blades cost pennies instead of dollars.  Well worth the long-term cost.</li>
    <li> I feel like an aristocrat after shaving with this.  My face hasn&#x27;t been this smooth since the womb.  Also, I have yet to receive so much as a nick from this bad boy.</li>
    <li> It is a basic razor.  It comes in a basic box.    Solid feel  Clean fit and finish  Classy  Works perfectly for me!    Once I got used to this type of razor, I experienced a more enjoyable shave.  The movement feels smoother and more precise while shaving.  It leaves my skin less irritated afterward.  Blades are cheap and available everywhere. (Compared to standard modern razors)    I think this is the last razor I will ever need to buy!</li>
    <li> This razor is everything I hoped it would be. Close Shave. Easy to clean razor. Stylish. What more could you want. It takes the stubble off the face.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough kind words about this razor. This is my first safety razor so I cannot compare it to others. I can, however, compare it to the electric and multi blade ripoffs I&#x27;ve used in the past. The best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  Doesn&#x27;t hurt that a year&#x27;s supply of blades costs less than a month&#x27;s supply of Mach-whatevers.</li>
    <li> You have to remove the entire head to put in or replace the blade, loosen it up to clean it out which is a pain.  The butterfly open style is the only way to go.</li>
    <li> Good shave, but be careful because it can cut deeply if you go too fast or at bad angle.</li>
    <li> fantastic razor with good heft and classic styling. Unlike disposable razors, this thing is easy to clean and you will save in the long run by just replacing the blade once in a while depending on how often you shave.</li>
    <li> I have a very thick beard and sensitive skin. The main things I was after in using a safety razor were:&lt;br /&gt; - A closer shave&lt;br /&gt; - Less irritation&lt;br /&gt; - More swipes between rinses&lt;br /&gt;And I have to say I am completely blown away. I will never, ever go back to anything more than one blade.&lt;br /&gt;It takes a little bit of practice, and there is certainly a technique to it, but by my third shave with this razor I was fully convinced.&lt;br /&gt;I actually look forward to shaving, when before I always hated it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The icing on the cake is that the blades cost between 20-40 cents each. I have used the blade that came with the razor for 2 weeks, made certain to properly rinse and store it, and it is still going strong.&lt;br /&gt;I am certain that the 3 and 5 blade razors you find in most stores were designed to make money, not shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are far too many positive things to say about this razor and safety razors in general for this review. Do yourself a favor and do some research. This is the way we were meant to shave. If you are on the fence, you can pick up a cheap safety razor of ebay. But I strongly recommend you just make the investment in this top quality handle. It is solid, beautifully weighted, and I plan to use it for the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m throwing all my &amp;#34;modern&amp;#34; shavers in the trash and I&#x27;m keeping this one. It&#x27;s very sturdy, it has excellent fit and finish and it feels just right in your hand. My dad and brother will definitely enjoy their Christmas present for years to come without spending an arm and a leg on replacement blades. Way to go Merkur, your product rocks!!! Do yourself a favor and buy this product, you won&#x27;t regret it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this safety razor based on various reviews I read. Quite a few people (specially old timers) were raving about how good this razor is and how it reminds them of the good old days before the Schick Quatro and the other modern razors. I was actually using the Schick Quatro myself. As others have commented, I was also turned off by the high prices of the replacement heads and wanted a no fuzz razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased one for myself and 2 for Christmas presents, one for my dad &amp; one for my brother. I&#x27;m so glad I did because I just used the razor for the first time and I&#x27;m hooked. I can&#x27;t remember the last time I had such a smooth shave. It was quite an experience since I also bought the Badger Shaving Brush and the Proraso shaving soap. My face was as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom with no cuts or razor burn.</li>
    <li> good item i like better than does gillets at walmart to much money in ordinary razors i like coz they cheap</li>
    <li> It was quite monday morning in my 24th year of life.  I had decided to take a trip to my Opa&#x27;s house accross town before work.  He answers me at the door with a grunt and a neutral face so I knew he must be happy to see me.  I had just washed and shaved and smelled of Old Spice aftershave, Axe Deoderant, and Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Fierce Cologne.  My Opa proceeds to tell me he need me to get something in the backyard but when we get out back he shoves me in his pool.  After I had gotten out and proceeded to yell at him for 5 minutes, he said to me, &amp;#34;I could smell you from across town with all that crap on you, and you missed a whole half of your neck when you were shaving.  The stench of you must be blinding you.&amp;#34;  As I started to sulk he told me of a path, a man&#x27;s path to enlightenment.  He told me that only a real man can go down this road and that I would need to find out if I was man enough to do it or to continue my days of being blind of missing spots and stinking.  He told me of the safety razor, lather, and brush.  Told me only a real man would use these items.  So, I went online and did a bunch a research.  I was afraid to venture down that path.  I still loved being a boy of 24 with not a care in the world.  But sometimes, we all have to grow up.  I purchased this safety razor in my 24th year.  The feel of it in my hand has I shave off every hair on my face in one stroke, the feel of no razor burn or chunked up face from electric razors, the power it makes me feel, I am no longer that scared boy! I am a man!  Now I can look my Opa in the eyes without feeling embarassed because I missed a spot.</li>
    <li> Let me begin by saying that switching from disposable multi-blade razors to a safety razor was one of the best decisions I have made as a consumer.  The savings add up extremely quickly and the quality of the shave is much better from a safety razor in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Breakdown:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Gillette Fusion ProGlide with an extra cartridge costs ~$10 and will last let&#x27;s say 1 month.  That&#x27;s $120 annually on shaving blades (plus additional cost for shaving cream)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Safety razors cost ~$20-$40 upfront, but the blades are extremely cheap (I purchased 100 blades for $7 and they work great).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the first year of shaving, you&#x27;ll already save $75-$100!  Each year after that, however, you&#x27;ll be saving another $100!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-Works well when the proper blades are purchased (read reviews to determine if they are good quality)&lt;br /&gt;-Extremely affordable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-None&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had no issues with this razor whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product!  I hope this review was helpful</li>
    <li> Everyone should own one of these.  I use the Shark blades and am very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> You owe it to your self to try this razor.. There a bit of learning curve to it.. But you well not  regret it once you have master it.. And if you rush to shave .. This is not for you..</li>
    <li> Excellent razor. I have big hands and this razor fits nicely in my hands.  You don&#x27;t need to apply pressure the weight of razor allows for a smooth clean shave with feather razor blades.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband after he became tired of spending excessive amounts on expensive disposable fancy razors. I chose this model because of the positive reviews, and after he watched youtube training videos, and had a few learning curve incidents, he seems to be very pleased. This will be a much more cost effective means of shaving and he says it gives him a close shave.</li>
    <li> Best purchase I have made so far. Perfect for daily shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was once a Mach 3 man and now have loved shaving with a close, real shave of the safety razor. It diminishes razor burn, gets a closer shave, and far better than any other razors I have ever used</li>
    <li> Best purchase I&#x27;ve ever made for my thick bearded husband.  He says it was the best gift he&#x27;s ever gotten.  Turned shaving time from miserable to pleasurable.  Really, I&#x27;m not being paid to say it.  He always hated shaving.  It gave him terrible razor burn.  I saw a program on TV talking about how single blade razors cause less razor burn and work really well.  I agree.  This razor may seem expensive but I bought ours two years ago with a huge pack of razor blades and we haven&#x27;t bought new blades since.  It has saved us a ton of money on disposable blades.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this on my legs and it works great there too.  No nicks or cuts at all.</li>
    <li> Very sturdy, not cheap, easily cleans hair out even when I let mine get long. The shape prevents cuts and with the Feather blades gives amazingly good feeling and looking shaves. I will be using this until I lose it somewhere then I will buy another. Would make an awesome gift for someone who has to shave alot like I do. Disposables are for the garbage, this is the way to shave.</li>
    <li> Love the quality&amp;design. Smoothy enough to prevent hurting the face.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. The razor is as pictured. I bought this razor on a whim while picking up a tub Taylor&#x27;s. If your new to this type of razor I&#x27;m sure you will find it a fine razor. It does its job, which is shaving your ugly mug. If your my age you will find its not the Merkur you know. It has that made in China look and feel that aside if you don&#x27;t let the threads and head get corroded with hard water this razor should last most a life time. If you want that baby butt smooth face then I would suggest stepping up a little to one of Merkur&#x27;s better razors or even a Jager. This is a great utility, everyday razor as long as you use good blades. The Merkur bladed it comes with are also a good daily blade. If your new to this type of razor its not so much about the razor. The cream makes a world of difference. The Taylor creams are probably the best out their. Don&#x27;t try to cheap out and buy the local pharmacy or grocery store creams.&lt;br /&gt;If you on a tight budget and want to try out a high quality safety razor get off the internet and run down to a thrift store or antique shop. You will find a much nicer razor for a few dollars or less. That with an old coffee mug and a badger hair brush will last you a lifetime.</li>
    <li> I use this as my travel razor !! If your looking to buy just one non-adjustable razor, go for the Edwin Jagger !!! My personal favorite razor is the adjustable Merkur Futur !!!!</li>
    <li> I absolutly love the shave i get from this, and so does my wife!</li>
    <li> Too sharp, too scary, too much razor burn. I&#x27;m not man enough, I&#x27;m not worthy. I thought I could save mucho dinero by switching to a safety razor, but I didn&#x27;t feel safe with a razor with the word safety in it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Very high quality. The weight is perfect and balanced. I followed the directions and tips and haven&#x27;t had an issue with it. Very important to dry the razor, as well the blade (prolongs the life of the blade). As long as you buy a good shaving cream and apply it well, you will be fine. Just search on youtube and read online for tips and advices.</li>
    <li> Used to use cartridge razors until I got tired of having my skin get irritated every time. Switched to this safety razor, along with Derby razor blades (so cheap!) and it&#x27;s definitely better! You get a clean cut with little to no irritation at all. This honestly isn&#x27;t more difficult than a regular cartridge razor...you won&#x27;t cut yourself unless you really try. I think I&#x27;ve cut myself once and I ordered these a year and a half ago.</li>
    <li> This is my first DE razor purchase and while there is a learning curve it does feel like a better experience compared to traditional disposable head razors. It is also much less expensive!</li>
    <li> This is what a razor is supposed to be like..High Quality, with a great design..Not a trap door at the top, that wings open...top cap comes off for a better cleaning.</li>
    <li> i really like this razor.no more razor burn or ingrown hairs.reasonable price,fast shipping.i recommend this razor to all amazon users.</li>
    <li> I had just a little trouble reconciling myself to a three piece razor, but after putting in the first blade and shaving with it, I really like this razor. I can now get a close and comfortable shave every time. I now enjoy shaving again. Quality of the razor, and the shave, is great.</li>
    <li> Heavy and well made. This is quality. I&#x27;ve used this razor exclusively for nearly 5 years now and have no complaints.</li>
    <li> After purchasing the last 4-pack of razor cartridges for something around $4 a cartridge, we decided to seek out a cheaper alternative.  Enter the Merkur.  After reading on Lifehacker about how much more economical a safety razor is, I decided we couldn&#x27;t pass it up.&lt;br /&gt;There is a learning curve.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend watching a couple videos on how to shave with a safety razor.  A post-shave lotion helps as does actual shaving soap (you&#x27;ll need a brush as well).</li>
    <li> Nice design, easy to use. It was shipped in a very cool box, as well. Also came with one blade which was a nice surprise.</li>
    <li> I love this razor, it shaves so close and the razor are 10.00 for ten. That&#x27;s a dollar for one razor.</li>
    <li> Been using this for a couple years now, both my wife and I.  We can get 2-3 shaves out of one blade but keep in mind I don&#x27;t have lots of facial hair.  I did cut myself on my very first try but never since.</li>
    <li> can you say awesome? great starter razor, gives an amazingly smooth shave with NO discomfort. you can&#x27;t even tell you are running an absurdly sharp razor across your face. My wife has since stolen this razor and claims it as her own.</li>
    <li> This is the first double-edge safety razor that I&#x27;ve tried. It&#x27;s good in every way except that there seems to be some calcium or other water deposits that always collect on the head of the razor. It doesn&#x27;t really affect the functionality, but it doesn&#x27;t seem as clean as I would like.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try the double edge razor after years of using the multi blade systems. This razor is well built and should last quite a while. I read reviews of other razors and decided to try this one. It seems designed and manufactured to give a very comfortable shave.  I didn&#x27;t realize that there were so many different blades offered. I took the advice from several reviews and purchased the variety pack of different blades. I haven&#x27;t finished using them yet but the shark brand seems to work for me the best so far. I am sure that it is a combination of the correct blade for your face and the excellent razor  provides the best shave that I have had in years. Cost wise I am sure that this is the most economical way to shave considering the value of buying blades at 100  per package. Also using hair conditioner instead of a soap seems to work for me just fine. I would say buy this razor then find the correct blade and enjoy shaving again.</li>
    <li> This item has the weight that helps you fill closer to the face. This to me make it easy to shave.</li>
    <li> 4th year owning and it can be shined to look new again, but has held up well with minimal effort. Great to learn on the long handle helps to find the point and its not so long that it doesn&#x27;t travel well.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor after years of using multi blade expensive cartridges and gave it a try on a 2-day growth beard.  It provides a much closer shave and when coupled with a good brush and shaving soap, provides a much better shaving experience.  The razor itself is a well constructed piece of hardware.  Some people may prefer the butterfly open style handles but this one works great and is not at all difficult to use.  It is true you lose some convenience.  The 5 seconds it takes to connect a new multi blade razor to a handle is now replaced with a 30 second process of removing the head and installing a DE blade.  And your shaving process is longer now too.  What used to be a 2 minute raking of my face with a multi blade cartridge is now a 10 minute process of whipping up shaving cream and carefully shaving my face (you could use canned shaving cream but I won&#x27;t).  I had no cuts or problems using it and unless you have no hand-eye coordination skills or are in too much of a hurry, you will not cut yourself.  Well worth the time given the results.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll experiment with different creams and blades to come up with the optimum mix but based on my first effort, this is the way I will shave from now on. Long term I&#x27;ll save a lot on replacement blades too.  I&#x27;m all in!</li>
    <li> Just like so many others, I was looking for ways to save money, both big and small.  I decided that switching to a safety razor would not only be a way to save money, but it also seemed like a fun activity.  I ordered this razor because of its popularity and amazing reviews.  I&#x27;ve been shaving with this razor for almost a year and will never go back to cartridge razors.  Not only are double edge blades so much more affordable than cartridges, the shaves are amazingly close, so I now get an extra day between shaves.  Thus I shave less often and save more money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is well made and feels perfectly balanced and sturdy in my hand.  I&#x27;ve used several different blade brands and models in this razor.  I&#x27;ve found a few blades I love and a few I hate, and some in between.  Finding a good blade makes shaves with this razor go from good to great!  Finally, wet shaving is a fun activity and now I look forward to shaving.  Shaving is now an enjoyable experience.  I&#x27;m now a wet shaving evangelist in telling my friends and co-workers what they have to gain by joining the world of wet shaving.  Nobody can go wrong by choosing this razor.  I don&#x27;t regret buying this Merkur razor one bit.  I want to buy more as gifts!</li>
    <li> This product was absolutely amazing. The description posted was very accurate. The price for the quality was amazing. An added bonus, it was here before I expected! A very happy buying experience.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend has been using this for a couple months now and loves it. After using the traditional disposable razors for years, this has been a breath of fresh air. It shaves very smoothly and better than the big name expensive triple, quadruple, and quintuple blade disposables. The replacement blades can be bought at any store where they sell the big name brands or right here on Amazon, and they cost less.</li>
    <li> Very nicely made product. It has nice weight to it. It&#x27;ll last a long time. Simple yet very classy looking</li>
    <li> This is my first time using a safety razor and it&#x27;s been about a week.  So far I love this razor.  The only knick I have so far was the first time I used it and it was minor... I kind of asked for it testing things out on the first run.  Since then I have not had the slightest knick, less irritation than my $5 cartridges ever had and an equal quality shave.  I imagine as I get a little more practice the closeness of the shave will improve as well (the grain in a couple of spots around my neck are a bit tricky).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also really appreciate the feel of this razor.  It is comfortable to hold and use, the heft of it is nice, I like the slightly longer handle, and it leaves my face feeling great.  I am using this with a brush and shave soap, and am currently using the blade that came with it.  I have some Feather blades on deck for when it dulls as I have heard they are excellent.</li>
    <li> After hearing all the hype of these razors I made my first purchase with this based on all the reviews. I wouldn&#x27;t know the difference in quality between any of these but what I see of this I love so far. Very easy to change out new blades, simple to clean, and looks classy in the medicine cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels like this thing won&#x27;t ever break down or lose its ability to shave since you replace only the blades anyway. I got sick of spending money on new cheap razors that I tended to use those disposable far longer than is safe. With this and a 100 pack of blades I may not need to buy another blade for over a year, opposed to 30$ or so every few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While shaving in itself wasn&#x27;t always considered a fun hobby, I enjoy it more now with this type of razor. Be it the novelty of it, having to mix my own cream and just having a blade that is more a personal item than a throwaway razor. The weight of it is solid, and really didn&#x27;t take much getting used to as I feared it would have. Just watch a few videos online get a few tips and good to go. I&#x27;ve only nicked a few times and one serious lip cut but all in all its a much better shave in the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day I&#x27;ll venture out and buy a higher end one, but for now this is more than sufficient for a first time user.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. It has a great feel and an easier shave for sensitive skin with the single razor contact. Recommend it.</li>
    <li> BENEFIT #1:&lt;br /&gt;If you want to realize how much you&#x27;ll be saving, look at the long term quantity prices:&lt;br /&gt;$10 for 100 pack of Astra DE blades&lt;br /&gt;$210 for 90 pack of Gillette Mach3 blades ($35 for 15 pack)&lt;br /&gt;$312 for 96 pack of Gillette Fusion blades ($39 per 12 pack)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BENEFIT #2:&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t forget the environmental impact. DE metal blades are incredibly environmentally-friendly in comparison to the modern Fusion or Mach blades, which require all sorts of plastic and odd materials and factory work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BENEFIT #3:&lt;br /&gt;Last but not least, the shave itself. It leaves a closer shave (depends on users I guess..) and in-grown errors or pricks/cuts aren&#x27;t as bad. Why? Because it&#x27;s only one blade. When you have a Gillette Fusion blade and you cut yourself, that blades cuts or irritates one spot five times in a row. When you cut yourself with a DE blade, it&#x27;s just a small \\&quot;Sorry, nicked you there\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just like modern multi-blades or any other type of razor, it takes time to learn the technique. It&#x27;s actually really easy, you mostly just learn to use the correct angles and not tug at it like you do with the modern multi-blades&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BENEFIT #4:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s rewarding. No, really, it&#x27;s actually kinda fun... which was something I didn&#x27;t expect. It was actually fun to hear the blade doing its work, which is completely absent with a modern razor. Maybe someday I&#x27;ll try out a straight razor, but a safety razor is definitely the perfect medium between a straight razor and modern multi-blade cartridge razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendation: Use wet shaving technique. Wet shaving means using a:&lt;br /&gt;-shaving brush (which applies far better than hands and you don&#x27;t get your hands messy. Parker makes some very long-lasting synthetic brushes [instead of animal badger brushes])&lt;br /&gt;-a shaving mug (I use an aluminum mug)&lt;br /&gt;-a soap-like gel/cream (I use Dr Bronners Peppermint 100% natural) + tiniest bit of water&lt;br /&gt;(I highly recommend the natural shaving gel. The skin gets irritated not just by modern cartridges, but also by unnatural, synthetic gels/creams)&lt;br /&gt;-Last but not least, get an empty soup can and cut a thin slit in it-this will be where you throw your used blades in. Don&#x27;t waste your money on some official blade bank. All a blade bank is is a metal container to put used blades in, which you eventually throw out entirely.</li>
    <li> Works just fine. Cuts way better than the disposables and you&#x27;ll never have to replace it, only the blades which are cheap. In the long run, you&#x27;ll save money.</li>
    <li> heavy, and a little unwieldy for me..  The handle could be longer.</li>
    <li> This is my second DE and I love it.  After learning how to shave with a DE, it worked great.  This is a great unit to use if you&#x27;ve been using a cartridge type razor, since it has a longer handle.  DON&#x27;T USE PRESSURE while shaving, let the heft of the razor do the work.  Shaving with a DE takes time and patience, but it&#x27;s well worth it!  This razor is also more &amp;#34;forgiving&amp;#34; than others.  I use the ASTRA Platinum Double Edge with it and it works great.  I would recommend purchasing a sample pack of blades though to find out what works best for you.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re tired of shelling out $8 for a plastic razor that will only last a week but don&#x27;t want to risk flaying yourself with a straight razor, this razor is perfect. After the initial cost of this (well worth it, as it feels like it will last longer than I will,) replacement razors are only about 12 cents. After a couple of months of use, this thing will more than pay for itself. After a couple of years, your shaving budget will be a small fraction of what it once was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You use this the same way you&#x27;d use your GilletteSchick Sensor XLR285 Alphastrike Eighteen Blade Magmaslice, or whatever they&#x27;re marketing this week. Shave as you normally would, but be sure to use a bit of a lighter hand. Honestly, this has a slightly higher chance to scrape you, but once you quit ham-fisting it, shaves are nice, clean and easy. It feels different than the plastic one you&#x27;re probably used to, so it takes a couple of days to get adjusted. However, it&#x27;s well worth it, and you can stick it to the razor companies who sell what should be a 30- cent item for $7 or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;But, wait,&amp;#34; you say. &amp;#34;There&#x27;s only one blade here! I need at least three or four to shave correctly these days!&amp;#34; Oh, but you don&#x27;t! I never understood why shaving with two, three, or even six blades makes sense. One will shave you clean, and once your clean, the other three don&#x27;t really do anything. And, hey, if one blade misses something, you can always, you know, just shave over the area again. Or, better yet, since the blade is double-ended, just swipe back in the opposite direction! This blade is cool like that.</li>
    <li> Excellent item. If you have been thinking of trying a safety razor...do it. I&#x27;ll never go back to cartridge blades again. This item has a long handle and feels a lot like modern razors in your hand.</li>
    <li> Love this razor!  My long search is over, I&#x27;ll never buy another razor.</li>
    <li> Great product! Well built and easy to handle.</li>
    <li> Only had this a week but, not impressed so far. My DE I bought from TV Ad (Pawn Star guy recommended) gives me a better shave.  Have read up on shaving methods all of which I already knew as I am no rookie at this only using the Merkur.  The Sandalwood soap I bought with the package deal while it smells nice it clogs the Merkur with each stroke and is difficult to wash out.  Too rich?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The guard function seems to be the issue as it doesn&#x27;t allow much contact with the blade.  Have replaced the blade twice already w/out any better shave.  Very disappointed and intend on returning if I can&#x27;t figure out something I am doing wrong (tried different angles too).  Read where DE razors with guard are designed for protective shaves more so than clean shaves?  Why bother.....</li>
    <li> Never got a close shave before, this is perfect.</li>
    <li> will save me a ton of money. gillette machIII were costing me tons of money.</li>
    <li> A good first razor. The only problems that I&#x27;ve encountered are:&lt;br /&gt;1. It&#x27;s a three piece razor, and sometimes the blade isn&#x27;t aligned correctly.&lt;br /&gt;2. This is less a problem, and more of a preference - if this is your first razor, I&#x27;d recommend buying the shorter handle, or even the HD version with the same head, but a shorter handle that&#x27;s connected to the bottom plate, making it a two piece razor.</li>
    <li> The craftsmanship is immaculate however it seems like even the fancy razors made by the same company do not project out far enough to sufficiently shave my face on one pass even if the angle is perfect.</li>
    <li> Excellent! Took no time at all to relearn shaving like a man. All you green types should be using these instead of filling landfills with that other garbage.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to the &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; shaving equipment, so I went off the reviews on this site, which led me to this razor. I&#x27;ve had no problems with it thus far, and it cuts very closely. The only area that I&#x27;m not able to shave closely is directly under my nose, because I can&#x27;t get the angle for the blade to cut and I&#x27;m still too much of a noob to go against the grain without slicing my face like deli meat. I&#x27;m afraid that I&#x27;ll have a kind-of Hitler mustache going on, so I use my Schick five-blade-whatever-it&#x27;s-called razor until I feel comfortable enough to use this razor for my entire face. It is an inconvenience, but it&#x27;s not the fault of the product at all; it&#x27;s just my own inexperience. You might wonder why I don&#x27;t just use the Shick instead, but one of the main reasons I bought this razor was to save money on blades, and I&#x27;m hoping that I&#x27;ll be able to shave underneath my nose before I run out of the Shick cartridges.</li>
    <li> well made works great</li>
    <li> This is a great mild razor that is very smooth with a persona red blade. The long handle helps with having good control. I would say it is slightly less aggressive than my ej 89. And more aggressive than mt gillette tech. The finesh is beautiful and cosmetically perfect. It is well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Great razor. Saving a lot of money and getting a better shave. Buy this.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as my first safety razor to see if I could make the switch from Mach 3 that I&#x27;ve used the last 7-8 years. I&#x27;ve continue to hear people rave about how great safety razors are and I was always interested so finally took the plunge. I bought some soap and a decent brush. Basically I picked items that had a lot of high reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I watched a quick video on youtube on making a lather and in a couple minutes had a nice thick perfect consistency lather on the first try. I read about how so many people cut themselves and said it was to be expected but gets better.  Maybe I got lucky but I took my time and didn&#x27;t make a single cut or nick.  I started by shaving with the grain and then came backs against the grain and I had a perfectly smooth shave. It did take me about twice as long as it normally did with the Mach 3 but that&#x27;s only because I read how so many guys said that you will pretty much cut and nic yourself if your coming for cartridge razors so I went very slow. I usually only shave twice a week&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to continue with this razor and have no intentions on going back. I gave the last 5 mach 3 razor cartridges to my wife. I did just buy a second merkur to keep in the shower. I have a mirror in my shower that has a razor holder built in to it and I occasionally like to shave in the shower so seeing as how little these razors cost, I decided to buy another to keep in there while my other in hanging in a little holder that holds it and my brush that I got from walmart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not 100% convinced that I will continue making my own lather though. I just didn&#x27;t see a benefit of it I guess. I don&#x27;t have a sensitive face at all. . I can and have shaved with just water only before without an issue, so shaving cream isn&#x27;t really that important to me like it is for some in preventing burns etc.  I&#x27;ll probably just continue to use my cheap no name shaving cream for simplicity.</li>
    <li> Love it way better than those junk 5 blades</li>
    <li> The perfect razor for the perfect gentlemen. If you think shaving is a lost art, then I implore you to try this fine piece of machinery. When I go on my many business trips around the world, I always pack this razor. It&#x27;s completely worth taking it with my luggage. The horrible new age razors damage your skin, and always give you nicks, especially around the neck. This safety razor takes more time to shave, but damages your skin less. If you want a silky, beautiful, and impeccable face(like I have), switch to this razor. I am a man always traveling , and have dealings daily with high level clients. My personal appearance is essential to my success, so it&#x27;s no wonder I put such care into shaving. From the head down on down, from my perfectly chiseled features, to my lustrous Omega watch, I am a man not to be taken trivially. Join the mile high club, and become an adonis of man. haha</li>
    <li> I bought this razor for my brother in 2012. He is still bragging about his safety razor to this day. He claims it has saved him a lot of money and has also given him confidence in knowing he looks great after a shave.</li>
    <li> Solid quality and proved a nice shave. Easy blade change. Suck it, Mach 3</li>
    <li> Very well made. This is my first experience with a double edged razor, and this razor seems to be a great option even for beginners.</li>
    <li> The razor is beautiful and well-made. I enjoy shaving with it. It&#x27;s fits will in your hand and has a nice feeling to it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this razor for over a year now and it&#x27;s fantastic! You can get good razor blades for dirt cheap. You can get a HUNDRED Derby Extra blades for less than ten dollars. Assuming you use a new razor blade every week, this comes out to around ten cents a week. Costing essentially NOTHING! A ten pack of Gillette Sensor razor blades costs around twenty dollars, or two dollars a week. Switch to a Safety Razor and you will save around a hundred bucks a year!  Make it a gift set and include a pack of Derby razor blades, Sandalwood shaving cream, and badger shaving brush.

    <li> well balanced havent used a safty razor in years and didnt nick myself first time used so I would say it&amp;#34;s a good razor</li>
    <li> Great razor with a long handle that allow you to hold it and still see the sensitive shaving areas visually and not shave based on feel in those areas. Commercial packaging more than adequately protects the razor and it arrived a couple of days early.</li>
    <li> This was my first safety razor, and I&#x27;m pretty happy but I will be amping up to a heavier razor. It&#x27;s a good starter even though I know it will rust after a year... But whatever, it&#x27;s a bargain and quite beautifully built!  I do recommend for beginners in the art of wet shaving.</li>
    <li> Love the long handle. Reminds me of the razor my Dad used.</li>
    <li> This thing is great! The long handle isn&#x27;t a problem for me at all, but it may be different for some other people. It also does take some getting used to. I cut myself the first few times I used it, but once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s the best shave of your life, hands down. It&#x27;s a very clean product, just make sure you wipe it down every so often and when you change the blades so that stuff doesn&#x27;t build up in it (i.e. shaving cream and the like). I have to do that, but it&#x27;s not too big a deal. Great product.</li>
    <li> Best safety razor on the market! I forget to dry this thing off regularly and it never rusts! I get a clean shave regularly but it just takes time getting use to so you don&#x27;t cut up your face. My advice is to run this gently across your face and if your missing spots, reapply more shaving cream and run the razor back through the same spot!</li>
    <li> My husband says this is a very well-balanced razor, easy to hold and maneuver.  He is well-pleased with it.</li>
    <li> This safety razor has a nice weight to it, meaning you don&#x27;t have to put too much or no pressure at all to start shaving. The long handle is nice, too. Don&#x27;t overwind or you might end up breaking it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean the razor with a brush and some soap after switching blades. Also, you might want to unwind the razor a bit and wash down the stuck hair with running water after each shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should have switched to safety razor sooner. I have a very sensitive skin, and the multiple-blade razors in today&#x27;s market make my skin red and swollen. Most of them also tug and pull hairs which shouldn&#x27;t happen since they have blades for a reason. I guess that it just all comes down to preference, skin sensitivity, amount and type of facial hair in choosing which razor/shaver to use.</li>
    <li> I love this thing. I don&#x27;t have to spend half my paycheck on razors anymore. Simple to use once you get the hang of it (using the correct angle, and it&#x27;s a bit different from the regular muti-blades out there). This is all you need! Get it if you have a job where you must shave daily, and you&#x27;ll save so much money!</li>
    <li> Great razor with some heft behind it.  Easy to clean, great to use.</li>
    <li> Beautiful product. Arrived very quickly. Simple and elegant.</li>
    <li> Ive had on and off razor burn on my neck all my life. Not any more! Bought one for both my dad and my brother. Easily saves tons of money in the long run.</li>
    <li> A good quality product, has held up great for the past 7 months. Love it, enjoy shaving with it. I feel like it will last for years to come.</li>
    <li> At first I was planning on buying a cheaper brand for a lower price, but decided to buy the merkur longhandle. I was not disappointed. It feels great with a nice grip and the chrome finish looks nice.</li>
    <li> After quite a bit of research, I chose this razor for my venture into double edge blade shaving. It was a great choice. The quality of the razor is what one would expect from traditional German engineering - solid and precise. I have used it ten times now and even as a novice at this sort of thing, I have managed just one small nick. I am almost 60 years of age and so am a late convert to this type of razor after a lifetime of spending a fortune on Fusion cartridges. Now that I have tried this method I would never go back to the other method. I use a good pre-shave (Razorock) and Proraso Sandalwood, along with Wilkinson Sword blades. The result is a superb shave, closer than I have ever experienced before. Give it a try - for $30 or so you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> Plenty of handle to hold onto and nice weight for smooth strokes without needing to press down like on disposable razors. Easy to clean and change blades.</li>
    <li> Holy hell! What a difference this safety razor made after switching from the Parker 22R.  It&#x27;s like all of my blades have transformed into 1rst time feathers.</li>
    <li> So I grew up on the 4 blade razors from Gillet and Schick. I used the think the Schick Hydro was the best and greatest thing ever. My brother in law, brother, and dad all highly suggested this razor. It took some time to get used to, but it is easily the greatest razor ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Gillet and Schick razors may be really easy to use, but they do not get that close of a shave, unless you go against the grain.&lt;br /&gt;  Safety razors cut really nice, they are still easy to use, and they give an extremely close shave. They are also more precise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Gillet and Schick razor blades dull and become useless really fast on my coarse hair, and they are really expensive, especially the newer kinds.&lt;br /&gt;  Safety razors probably dull at the same pace, but they are significantly cheaper and double sided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Gillet and Schick do not normally give that bad of razor burn. If you switch to this razor be sure to use shaving cream or soap. I always shave with just warm water, so the first couple of times the safety razor gave some razor burn.</li>
    <li> This german steel will surelly last forever. The type of items that one does not see nowadays. . The craftmanship and quality of this product is top of the line.</li>
    <li> I love the Merkur!  I&#x27;ll never go back to my old quadruple-blade disposable razors that cost a fortune!  Plus, I get a closer shave with this product than I ever did with my old razors without sacrificing a pint of blood.  I get less nicks and have completely eliminated razor burn while shaving more frequently than in the past.  This is a rare instance where you get improved quality at an economical price while remaining environmentally friendly.  Plus, shaving with this item has a romantic/nostalgic feeling where life slows down and you can be a man.  The only thing missing from this experience is a cigar and a scotch!</li>
    <li> I got this razor for Christmas 2012.  I don&#x27;t typically shave every day, or every other day for that matter.  I&#x27;ve gone through disposable after disposable trying to find a decent razor that didn&#x27;t clog up after trying to shave a couple days of stubble growth.  Two blade, three blade, even tried a 5 blade.  None of them even came close to this single blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor takes out all my stubble in one pass with a quick rinse cleaning the blade, with the other multi blade razors I would need to shave 3 or sometimes 4 times to get it all and had to work at getting the blades clear after each pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost a month now and I am still using the blade that it came with, and it still shaves just as good as the day I got it.</li>
    <li> This was my first safety razor and it is absolutely amazing. It has a good weight to it and looks very professional.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used a double edge safety razor (DE) since about 1988.  This razor was my re-initialization into DE shaving, and I&#x27;m very happy with it. Since I&#x27;ve done this before, it only took one time to relearn how to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, this razor is heavy like a piece of rebar.  After using a variety of electric, cartridge, and disposables, it felt very heavy in the hand. I bought the long handled version because I have large hands.  It took some getting used to the weight, and it was quite awkward to hold.  After about half a dozen shaves, I finally got that hang of it.  The handle is textured well enough so that it doesn&#x27;t slip from my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor holds the blade evenly and tightly on both sides, and it&#x27;s easy to flip sides with a flick of the wrist. The angle of the blade is perfect for my beard, which is heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With shaving, it is all about the ritual/routine. I get my shaving soap ready with a few drops of hot water.  I wash my face with soap and hot water, which is a very important step.  I may put a few drops of shaving oil (King of Shaves) if I&#x27;m in the mood to help lubricate things. I get my brush wet and mix up the shaving soap to a good lather. Get the lather all around, using the tips of the brush bristles against my beard. I fill the sink with warm-hot water (not too hot), then I shave, rinsing often. I usually shower after I shave, but if I don&#x27;t, I will use alum (any alum will do) to seal up any nicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing about this razor is that I can make multiple passes without irritating my skin, which I couldn&#x27;t do with double or triple blades. I use less water to shave, because the razor doesn&#x27;t get clogged up and rinses easily in water.  Most importantly, I get the closest shave of my life, nearly every time. I get very few, if any nicks, compared to any other method, and when I do, they are small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not all beards are created equal, so your mileage may vary. If you are new to DE shaving, I would recommend reading some of the reviews on how to get the best shave. I will never go back to disposables.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this razor is better or worse than any other one, but it&#x27;s sturdy, and since it&#x27;s so simple, that&#x27;s probably the only thing that really matters. Considering they&#x27;re so simple, I&#x27;m not sure why they&#x27;re all $30+, but with razors costing a few cents each, I can&#x27;t really complain. This thing will probably last your whole life, so cost probably isn&#x27;t that big of a deal.</li>
    <li> an excellent razor for FB newbies with a middle of the road beard toughness. Great price too for the newbie.</li>
    <li> All of the reviews are right. This is the best way to shave! My only concern is finding replacement blades locally. (Only 1 store in town carries them!) At least you can still find a good amount online... I&#x27;ve used regular shaving cream, I&#x27;ve used the shave soap... Either work great. I am very pleased with the razor, it is a truly well built product. The quality of blades you use does affect the outcome, so get good ones; quality blades are still far less expensive than the razor you are using now. By far, this is the cleanest, smoothest shave I&#x27;ve ever experienced, and I don&#x27;t feel like I need to re-shave at 5:00 using this razor!</li>
    <li> Being an old Mechanical Engineer I can appreciate good design.  This german design is simple and well manufactured.  This is an affordable and great starter razor for anyone looking to get back to or begin shaving with double edged razors.</li>
    <li> I really like this razor. Some friends of mine were trying to get me into using this product. It&#x27;s in good shape and the blades are much cheaper then some of the popular razors on the market</li>
    <li> First time using a safety razor and I moved to it because I wanted to try something more old fashioned and also I got tired of buying expensive blades every 2-3 months.  Dropping $20+ for blades is ridiculous.  I started using this safety blade and I&#x27;m so happy.  Last but not least, razor bumps are gone!</li>
    <li> Shave my man very well. I think he likes it very much. What else can I say but it came with a free blade</li>
    <li> Do you go to the store and shudder at the price for razor blades or disposables?&lt;br /&gt;Get one of these and a pack of blades.  It saves you money in the long run and works just as well if not better than what you&#x27;re getting from the store. I have very thick facial hair and this just glides through.&lt;br /&gt;Get yourself some shaving soap, a bowl, and a boar hair brush and you&#x27;re set.  There is something nice about an old school shave.</li>
    <li> I was looking to make a change in razors to help with recent heavy irritation, the beginnings of in grown hairs. The merkur has been excellent for that, my face has settled down. My only complaint is that it is more difficult to achieve straight lines for my beard trim, but it is great for a full face shave.</li>
    <li> does not get a close shave and irritating on the skin. May need more time to condition the skin to the razor but so far not thrilled with result</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know my husband&#x27;s face could be that soft! The refills make it cost effective over time and more environmentally friendly. He reports that it&#x27;s easy to use as well.</li>
    <li> I liked the ratings so i gave it a try and glad i did. It cuts close and fast. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Very good,  solid feel and grip is nice when fingers are slimy/slippery from shaving soap. My friend has one and suggested it. Five stars if it didn&#x27;t kinda feel like one side allows the blade out more. But would absolutely recoo</li>
    <li> While my uncles used to shave with a safety razor, while I was growing up.  And after some reasearch,  I decided this year to buy the Merkur Model 180.&lt;br /&gt;A great surprise to get a close shave, surprised due to the comersial stating, &amp;#34;three blades are better than two, five is better than three.&amp;#34;  The balance of the razor is great, the weight is on the heavy side, which is a good thing, since you let the razor do the work.  Plus the money you save is worth it. (If you shave daily, you should use a new razor every week, the cost of the blades for this razor is $0.07 yo $0.10 per blade).</li>
    <li> I have liked having this razor handle and will be buying another for the fella so we can stop switching blades for each of us. Good weight and good quality...have had for at least a year now.</li>
    <li> Last &amp;#34;Movember&amp;#34; I read an article about shaving on one of the events websites. I&#x27;m 43 years old and no stranger to shaving. I learned and had been shaving with good quality disposable razors since i was 15. The article was a real ground breaker for me, it convinced me that shaving with a straight razor may be afar more economical way to get a good shave. It also spoke of the other benefits to using a safety razor: just as safe as a disposable, doesn&#x27;t clog, cleaner shave, less razor burn, etc. So, I came to Amazon and started looking. After reading the reviews for this product I bought it along with a pack of 100 Personna stainless steel blades. I had already purchased a bowl and brush set a few years back (when I had considered this before). I&#x27;ve been using it with a Van der Hagen soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, I&#x27;m hooked. Shaving has a ritual feel to it that I like and it is now a relaxing event instead of the hurried functional activity it was with disposables. Due to my coarse facial hair I used to have to shave every day with a disposable (three blades razors mostly). Now, I can get by with every other day to stay tidy. My skin is healthier with in-groan hairs now being an anomaly rather than a consequence. I change the blade out about every two weeks to once a month. My wife like the subtle scent and my skins feel which is a nice bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To change a blade with this razor you basically take it a part which is it&#x27;s only draw-back. But that is clearly described in the product description and something I knew buying it. My father had owned a butterfly type razor handle that I remember and he used to have to clean it as debris would collect in the center around the razor post. I have yet to have any issues with debris as this is basically a closed system. Easy to care for with effort you barely notice. The blade that comes with the razor is actually very good and lasted a month. When you consider I was using about 6 to 10 disposables a month this is a substantial savings and I was stretching that by not shaving every time I actually needed to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a long-handled version and I&#x27;m glad I went with it. It gives very good grip and takes very little effort to get an excellent shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trust me and the many others that have found safety-razor shaving as a preferred way to keep things neat. If you run a blade over your face you really want to be using a safety razor. If you do, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this razor set.his is a substantial savings and I was stretching that by not shaving every time I actually needed to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a long-handled version and I&#x27;m glad I went with it.

    <li> Great razor! the first few shaves I was slow and worried, that quickly faded. I shave a quick as I did with the mach5 now. Fast and well packaged shipping from Simply Beautiful!</li>
    <li> Great razor. It gives a smooth shave. I shave my face and head daily. The angle of the blade that Merkur and other brands is better than some of the generic razors sold on amazon, where the blade simply protrudes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with this razor, it&#x27;s a work of art. The plating is flawless, the precise machine work makes it a piece of jewelry. It&#x27;s hefty so take it slow and get some experience. I would recommend this razor to everyone.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to say enough about a safety razor but I&#x27;ve been using this for almost half a year now and the shave matches- if not beats the Mach 3 Turbo I have been using for the last decade. The main benefit here? I can save about $200 on replacement blades over the next 8 years (for the amount I use per month and shave). This coupled with the 100 pack of Astra blades has made me a safety razor convert for life!!! I owe my friend a lot for showing me the savings!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Build quality is great and no rust to be seen (which I was worried about as I just shave, shake it out and let it air dry). Just as shiny as the day it arrived, and very simple to change blades and shave with, while providing a nice grip, even when wet.</li>
    <li> This razor is really solid and well made.  Has a nice grip and feel to it and seems like it will last me a very long time.</li>
    <li> Great Razor and easy to insert the blades with a longer handle for men with larger hands</li>
    <li> I bought these razor to go with a shaving kit I also found in here for my honey. He is in the military and shaving, well, shaving for him is a chore that must be done daily.. This razor has changed it from a chore to be almost enjoyable.. He liked how sturdy the razor is and how good his skin feels after shaving..besides, is actually pretty sexy..</li>
    <li> Maybe I haven&#x27;t figured a technique yet but I cannot get a clean line on my beard. I bought this so I can get a razor sharp line while shaving/trimming my beard but they way this works it won&#x27;t allow me. It does take multiple passes through to get all hairs shaved since this is only a single blade. Will update if anything changes.</li>
    <li> ok the math, one razor and 100 razor blades came to about 60 bucks plus a little shipping. If you buy a Quattro or a Edge or anything else from your local Costco, you will pay close to that for about 40 blades plus the razor. and you will return shortly for more cartridges. this system works exactly as advertised. the razors (at least for me) seem to be lasting longer. at the rate I am going, 1 every 3 shaves, I will be good for over a year. so easy to see the better buy. next the ease of use and clean up is probably this little numbers best quality. takes just minutes to clean up and after a little practice the ease of shaving and comfort, closeness etc. are unmatched. (and I have tried all the cartridge brands). You will find yourself shaving fewer times per week, and spending less time cleaning it up, and less money. not to mention looking and feeling much better, I actually enjoy shaving, never thought I would say that. good luck and happy shaving to you all.</li>
    <li> Best investment ever single blade is all you need less irritation. Been using the Gillette blades for the last 25 years just became too costly with the Merkur I get a better shave and save money in the process.</li>
    <li> When I mentioned to friends, family, and co-workers that I was switching from expensive multi-blade razors to this single bladed model, I heard criticism all around me claiming they have experience with these type of razors. &amp;#34;You&#x27;ll cut yourself&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;It&#x27;ll never stay together, it&#x27;ll fall apart, and the blade will fall out&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;It&#x27;ll take forever to shave as you&#x27;ll have to do multiple passes so you&#x27;ll never get a clean shave&amp;#34;. NONE of this turned out to be correct. This razor is GREAT! I do need to make a few passes to get a clean shave of my beard area but it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t take any longer than shaving with a multi-blade that&#x27;s partially dull because I&#x27;m concerned with the cost of replacing a still usable blade. In the 6 months or so I&#x27;ve owned this razor, it seems I&#x27;m replacing the blade about once a month. I also purchased the &amp;#34;Personna Double Edge Razor Blades, 100 count&amp;#34; for about $14 so at this rate I&#x27;m spending 14 cents per blade and my supply will last me more than 8 YEARS. Try to find that deal from the over-hyped, overpriced, multi-blade systems!&lt;br /&gt;- Abby&#x27;s DAD</li>
    <li> Fantastic product. Not am I new to shaving with a safety razor, but I&#x27;ve had a VERY full beard for close to 2 years. Used this baby to shave it off and expose the glory of my slightly more pudgy and painfully pale face. As smooth as can be with no nicks at all. I also have EXTREMELY sensitive skin and this caused no irritation whatsoever. The long handle is a must even if you don&#x27;t have large hands, in my opinion - my hands are gigantic and this is more-or-less the size of a regular razor for me. Great construction, attractive and works perfect. Very pleased with this product &amp; highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Who hates paying those high prices for razors? I know I sure did. I was always skeptical about buying a safety razor though. I got tired of the prices of regular razors and gave it a try. It took me about 5-10 shaves to actually learn how to shave with this safety razor, but now that I know how to, I would never go back. I bought this around March and its now August and I have yet to spend any more money on shaving equipment. I bought a Derby extra razor blades of 100 count (only 20$ if I remember correctly) along with the Merkur Long Razor and I have yet to wait more money on razor blades. I shave 2-3 times a week and use a brad new razor blade every time I shave and I have well over 70 razors to go. At this rate I won&#x27;t have to buy more razor blades until the end of the year easily.&lt;br /&gt;This was the best decision I could have made! I have easily save hundreds of dollars and probably thousands in the future.&lt;br /&gt;Give it a shot and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> An extremely well crafted razor of excellent quality. I&#x27;ve found that I do shave differently with this razor (against the growth) and the results are fantastic. I get a far smoother shave with less irritation than using the multi-blade disposables. I was never able to shave against the growth with disposable razors. The very low cost of blades just adds to the value of this razor.</li>
    <li> Very good, close shave. Once you get the hang of it it saves you a ton of money on shaving. I got the razor and about a year supply of blades for the price of 6 fusion cartridges.</li>
    <li> I have not seen or used this razor.  But, it was overwhelmingly given highest marks and my son in law loves it.  I have a razor I&#x27;ve used for 45 years, or I would buy one for myself as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is all I can share on this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But reading the lower star reviews on this razor, I believe a comment may help:  Shaving is something I did for decades and only understood well in past couple years.  If you are getting this razor and other items for classic shaving, learn how to really use the brush, bowl and shaving soap!  Find the video of the sweaty guy in front of mirror on youtube (mantic59) and learn how to make real foam!  He has too many videos so you need to find one on basic techniques on making foam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Real foam, not the canned stuff, is a big part of a great shave and even the best safety razor can&#x27;t overcome bad foam or technique.</li>
    <li> My husband has to shave everyday and usually has a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow by noon. Since he&#x27;s been using this razor, we can tell a huge difference! It&#x27;s completely different from what people usually use so it takes practice and getting used to. My husband loves it! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I am sure this would last a lifetime if you treat it right. Beautiful build. Superb Quality. Perfect Functionality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use, anyone who complains is just lazy. It takes 30 seconds to find the edge on this razor and the rest will be history. I don&#x27;t really get razor burn any more unless I shave against the grain. (I have very thick facial hair)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shave with this in the shower with no shaving cream. On both my face and my pubic hair with no razor burn. Sorry for the imagery but if you use the proper blade then this is a serious instrument. I have never been close to cutting my self. Because of the tension in the blade it creates a circumstance in which it is very difficult to cut smooth skin if used properly. And I reiterate that proper use is as difficult as figuring out how to use a fork. People screw up using a fork yes but it&#x27;s quite simple to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this highly and would buy it again but I know I won&#x27;t have to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.s. The best blades I have used so far are ( I bought the 25 unit sample pack) Feather and the Merkur blade that came with the razor.</li>
    <li> I love this thing. I started shaving my head a few years back and it was costing me a small fortune in razors. This is an initial investment of about $50 which includes the razor, the blades, brush and soap. It takes a few minutes longer to shave but it is much more enjoyable and my skin has never been healthier. Old School is like that I guess. Buy here for your shaving needs too because the Art of shaving prices are pure insanity.</li>
    <li> Love this razor. A thousand times better shave than all that multiblade nonsense. Never going back. And man is this hella classy. I feel like I own a study willed with rich mahogany and leather bound books every time I touch it.</li>
    <li> I will start out by saying that shaving with a safety razor is very different than shaving with a modern scrape razor. I use to use the Gillette Fusion and I was pretty happy with the results, although I noticed that I would get ingrown hairs on my neck and it did tear up my skin a little. I ran out of razor heads and thought I might try shaving with a safety razor due to the long term cost benefits. The first shave was not the greatest with the safety razor. I cut the under side of my chin a bit. For the record, this had nothing to do with the razor itself. It had to due with finding the right angle.&lt;br /&gt;Now that I have gotten use to shaving with the safety razor and found the angles and took a close look at direction my hair grows, I now have a much closer shave and no longer have ingrown hairs on my neck, no razor burn or bumps. Switching made shaving actually enjoyable and well worth the switch.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend! Takes a little practice if you&#x27;ve never shaved witha single blade razor before. Quality product. Very well made and easy to replace and adjust the blades. Makes a great gift for a man.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant at first to buy a safety razor just to try it out, but boy am I glad I did. This thing gives me the smoothest, most comfortable shave of my life. Paired with Feather brand razors, it shaves like a dream. It&#x27;s especially nice to warm up the metal (stainless steel, it seems) head in hot water first- shaving isn&#x27;t a chore anymore, it&#x27;s a delight.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor about three months ago.  I use it with Personna blades, Wiiliams mug soap, Kingsley soap bowl, and finish with a Gentleman Jon alum block.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is very solidly constructed and holds the blade securely.  It has a nice chrome finish, and feels good in hand.  The diamond pattern handle makes it easy to hold when wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the initial expenditure, this is a very inexpensive way to get a close shave.  Paying about 12 1/2 cents per blade is a lot easier to take than getting gouged by the multi-blade razor companies.  There was a short period to acclimate to the process, but it was worth it.</li>
    <li> First Safety Razor ever. Never cut ny face knock on wood. Ships fast great purchase. At 15 cents a blade who needs a $35 5 pack mach5</li>
    <li> Great razor! I should have had one of these years ago!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 6+ months, have not had any problems with the razor specifically, only with my face and my technique, would highly recommend the razor.</li>
    <li> Excellent Quality. Razor exceeds my expectations. First time user of a safety razor, have now eliminated the 4 and 5 blade disposable razors from my daily use.</li>
    <li> Love shaving with this razor. Never go back to disposable. Takes a few times shaving to few comfortable but it is the best.</li>
    <li> I treated myself to the brush, shaving cream, merkur blades and razor made by The Art of Shaving. I am now getting a much smoother shave then ever before.  The initial investment is a little high but I have found that in the long run these products save money. The merkur blades are less expensive and last longer than the cartridges I was using. I just need a small amount of the shaving cream for each shave. I was so satisified that I sent my son the products as a gift. I would recommend these products to anyone who shaves.</li>
    <li> This razor seems to be of very high quality. I love the way that it feels in my hand. It is just heavy enough to give you control when shaving. It is a great razor for those delving into the world of safety razors.</li>
    <li> my first safety razor and it has been great for the past 5 months</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t cut myself once with this razor. Just a good a shave as one of the multiple blade things. Just take your time and get a feel for it before you go full speed.</li>
    <li> It takes some getting used to, but you can get a pretty good shave out of this thing if you use it right after you get out of the shower and change the razors regularly. It does take a little longer to shave. You have to be a little more careful with what you are doing, and you have to take your time. It is a cool razor and does the job, with a little extra effort, but it&#x27;s not the greatest thing in the world. Looks cool, too, though.</li>
    <li> The Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor (#23c) delivers a phenomenal shave at a cheaper cost and with a very accommodating learning curve. I have used a variety of razors and this Merkur takes a very comfortable 1st place over them all. Considering the options available to be now, I am confident I will never use another razor or shaving system. If you&#x27;re even slightly displeased with the performance or cost of your current razor, I highly recommend giving this Merkur a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a bit about my beard and razors I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My beard:&lt;br /&gt;I grow a thicker than average beard. The hairs per square inch on my face are probably average, but the hairs themselves are thick. They grow in a downward direction everywhere except on the left and right sides of my Adam&#x27;s apple, where they grow down and away from my Adam&#x27;s apple. I shave in the direction my hair grows or at a small angle to the direction they grow. I do not shave against the direction they grow because I am very susceptible to ingrown hairs (I believe this susceptibility is independent of the razor I use).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My routine:&lt;br /&gt;I shave 3+ times each week. I use homemade vegetable based soap slightly superfatted with coconut oil. I use a Parker badger hair brush that I purchased on Amazon almost 4 years ago for $30 (the Parker label has worn off, but the brush is as good as the day it arrived in the mail).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience with razors:&lt;br /&gt;Remington (electric, ~$120) - Did not provide a close shave. Did not provide a uniform cut (some parts of my beard were cut shorter than others). Caused razor burn to the left and right of my Adam&#x27;s apple. Dull after 1 year and the metal screen had a couple of cracks (I believe this is more a function of my beard on the razor, not the quality of the razor itself).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Multi-blade cartridge razors - Provide a good shave, but I simply cannot justify the cost. In fact, I&#x27;m not sure how anybody justifies the cost of these things.My theory is that they are not aware of other options or cannot see past the marketing. A coworker told me about a $6/month subscription he had for receiving multi-blade razor cartridges; he thinks it is a great deal. This is quite expensive when compared to shaving with straight or safety razors (assuming you don&#x27;t buy some kind of fancy heirloom like razor).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Single and double blade disposables - Provide a good shave, but they only stay sharp for 2 shaves. This makes them expensive over the long term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Straight razor with disposable blades - I used one of these for over 3 years. It provides a good shave on certain parts of my face, but I had difficulty achieving a close shave on my neck hairs. I may be alone in this, but I found it difficult to hold the razor at the proper angle to accommodate the different surfaces of my face, chin, and neck. Holding a razor parallel to the blade (as in using a straight razor) is much more cumbersome for me than holding a razor perpendicular to the blade (as in using a cartridge, disposable, or safety razor). Shaving took more time with this razor because I had to be more careful. I got a lots of small nicks and a couple of bigger ones over the 3 years. Shaved whiskers would get caught in the junction between the blade and the plastic blade holder and were an inconvenience to clean out mid-shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why the Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor (#23c) is my favorite:&lt;br /&gt;This razor holds the blade at the best angle for my face that I&#x27;ve ever experienced. It&#x27;s heft allows it to easily glide across my face with minimal effort. As a result, it uniformly cuts my whiskers, I very rarely get a nicks, I have not experienced any razor burn, and I can shave much more quickly than I can with a straight razor (a bit more quickly than with a cartridge or disposable razor). Also, the construction of this Merkur is very solid. All of the parts go together simply and tightly and it is very easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended blades:&lt;br /&gt;I have used more than 10 different brands of safety razor blades and the obvious best is Astra&#x27;s Superior Premium Platinum Double Edge Safety Razor Blades. (You may prefer another kind depending on the characteristics of your beard.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost:&lt;br /&gt;At the time I&#x27;m writing this, here are the 1 year, 5 year, and 10 year costs of my shaving routine (soap excluded).&lt;br /&gt;Razor: $35&lt;br /&gt;Brush: $35&lt;br /&gt;Blades: $12 for 1 year (buying 100 blades, but only using ~50); $32 for 5 years; $63 for 10 years&lt;br /&gt;***TOTAL: $82 for 1 year; $102 for 5 years; $133 for 10 years&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A $6/month razor subscription will cost $72 for 1 year, $360 for 5 years, and $720 for 10 years. Folks, this is a joke and a few companies are paying a lot of money to get you to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said before, if you&#x27;re even slightly displeased with the performance or cost of your current razor, I highly recommend giving the Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor (#23c) a shot.</li>
    <li> Just got this thing yesterday and am pretty satisfied with my first shave with a safety razor. I was using a Gillette Fusion manual razor before this, and though I was happy with it&#x27;s performance, the cost of the cartridges was getting to be too much. The Merkur was easy to unscrew, and though getting the sample Merkur blade out of it&#x27;s wrapper was a bit of a tussle, it was easy to load into the heads and reassemble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not time it, but the shave did take me a while longer than normal, and this was due to a few factors. One, it was also my first time using Proraso shaving soap, so I had to learn to make the lather and also apply it with my badger brush. Secondly, I was really experimenting with getting the right angle and the amount of pressure I wanted to apply(barely any).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the shave went great as I had no nicks or cuts and my face is feeling quite smooth. I had a lot of trouble with the area under my chin, though. No cuts, but It took me forever to get a few stubbles just right under my jawline. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll learn to get them faster eventually.</li>
    <li> Previously, I strictly used an electric razor and was never really satisfied by the shave I got or how it would never hold a charge for long. After using this Merkur safety razor, I&#x27;m sold forever on it. The shave I got was a lot closer and the experience was much more pleasant. If this type of razor was good enough my grandfather, then it&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
    <li> You never really understand how poor of a job the triple and quadruple razors like the Mach 3 etc do when it comes to shaving. The difference between those&lt;br /&gt;razors and safety razors are night and day.&lt;br /&gt;With the Mach3  I would feel my stubble coming in the same day I shaved. With the safety razor it takes at least a whole day.&lt;br /&gt;Yes shaving is an art and a ritual. It&#x27;s not something you should rush through. Get the long handle if like me you got used to the Mach 3 razors.&lt;br /&gt;I believe the idea that it takes longer to shave with a safety razor than the other stuff is simply not true. It only takes longer because once you adopt the double edge razor, you focus more on getting a better shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our fathers had it right when it came to shaving. Get a Merkur and I recommend the long handle and you will be glad you did.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor because I was tired of paying the ridiculous prices for blades. I wasn&#x27;t sure what it would be like to go back in time. It was a great decision all the way around. Great shave, wonderful sturdy, attractive product and Amazon did a quick and efficient job delivering the product. It sits proudly on my sink and I am receiving clean shaves.</li>
    <li> A great razor! No need to pay all that money for those 5 blade razors that give you razor burn. Don&#x27;t believe the hype about those new flexball razors! They&#x27;re making tons of money off of you!!!! The fat cats are are getting fatter and you&#x27;re paying 15 bucks for 4 razors!!! I pay 5.50 for 10 blades and each blade gets @ 10 close shaves. Do the math.</li>
    <li> The shaver has good solid construction,clean shave and well worth the price I would recommend it to any one who is intending to buy a new but old concept .</li>
    <li> The razor was delivered in a short time, and I&#x27;m very happy with the vendor and the product.&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice heft to it, and is definitely a quality product which will last for years.</li>
    <li> Works very well. Replacing blades could be a bit more friendly but so could a walk in your local park</li>
    <li> Wanted to get my husband something different and personal for Christmas. Bought this razor as a present for him and he LOVES it. He has said that it was the best present in years and it has changed his grooming ritual. It gives him a cleaner, smoother shave and he has thanked me many times for having bought this razor. He has had such a great reaction that I am super happy that I purchased this: )</li>
    <li> This razor is fantastic.  You don&#x27;t need 3 or 4 or 5 blades for a clean shave, you need that many to tear up your face.  My face is so smooth after switching to the Merkur and the shaving bumps I have always had are GONE.  Plus its really easy to use and not dangerous, so don&#x27;t worry.  I just rub a bar of lathering soap (its called shaving soap) on my face in the shower and shave like I normally would.  Its really easy, and I have only nicked myself one time ever.  My wife saw how much I liked mine so she had me buy one for her too.  She loves it as much as I do.  She said its much gentler on her armpits and gives a cleaner shave.   UPDATE: Its been 5 years and it finally broke. 5 years! I still love it and immediately ordered another one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d do 5 stars, but the design of getting the blade in and out seems awkward. Otherwise, completely safe for a female to use, no need to be very careful.  Best razor I&#x27;ve used! Use along with shave secret oil for shave perfection!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been a big fan of mens razors with aloe strips and moisture strips. they are supposed to be \\&quot;mens\\&quot; razors after all. I had read positive reviews about the Merkur Safety razor in a mens magazine. After ordering the razor I hopped on Youtube and watched some instructional videos on how to shave old school. I picked up some great tips. After having the razor for about two weeks now I can safely say its the best razor I have ever owned. i have yet to have a cut or a nik, it feels great in my hand, and is built to last forever.  When using for the first time just go slow and gentle until you get the feel for it.  it&#x27;s a beautiful piece of craftmanship.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;I&#x27;ve never felt you so smooth!\\&quot;    This product is win! Very safe, VERY easy to setup and start using.  I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
    <li> What can I say about this razor that hasn&#x27;t already been said?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very well made, very simple razor, that happens to give me an extremely close shave, far closer that anything I&#x27;ve ever had from cartridges, and believe me, I&#x27;ve tried them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said though:&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re thinking about getting into old-school classic shaving, understand that it may take you awhile to figure out what combination of \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; gives you what you&#x27;re looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the biggest variable seems to be the blade, so if you do purchase this razor and it rips your face up(and you&#x27;re fairly sure it&#x27;s not your technique), wait for your face to heal and try a different brand of blade. Do not, I repeat DO NOT suffer along with a bad blade... you don&#x27;t have to, because there is a blade out there that will treat you kindly, believe me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not that these razors are magical and do something that the disposable cartridge blades don&#x27;t do, it&#x27;s that these razors will not let you get away with a sloppy shave the way a Mach-3 will. You either do it right or you get all cut up and weird looking. So these razors MAKE you slow down and shave correctly. If you don&#x27;t know how, no shame in that, there are a zillion forums out there with members glad to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you find your correct mix of \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; you will be a happy camper. And the fun is in figuring it out, so remember, enjoy the ride - it&#x27;s just a shave...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get yourself:&lt;br /&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;Razor [Double Edge or Single Edge]&lt;br /&gt;Blades sample packs [nothing&#x27;s worse than having 99 blades you&#x27;ll never use]&lt;br /&gt;Mug, Scuttle, Cup, Bowl [whatever try what looks good to you]&lt;br /&gt;Shaving soap/cream/stick [whatever try them ALL]&lt;br /&gt;Aftershave [and don&#x27;t be scared of what your grandpa used!!!]&lt;br /&gt;Witch-Hazel [BLESSED RELIEF!!!]&lt;br /&gt;Alum block [*optional, personally I love the stuff]&lt;br /&gt;Styptic [to stop bleeding fast]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No two men shave the same way, so there you have it, FIND YOUR WAY!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great razor. The \\&quot;long handle\\&quot; can be misleading if you&#x27;re new to safety razors like I was when I bought this.  It actually makes the razor about the same length as a Gillette Fusion razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weight of the razor is great.  Insert the blade (I prefer the Feather blades) and let the weight of the head do the work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suffered for years with skin irritation and razor burn using Gillette products.  I was shaving every other day to reduce irritation.  Turns out I just needed to learn how to use 1 blade instead of 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I shave daily, using the feather blades, proraso pre-shave cream, sensitive skin shaving soap and sensitive skin aftershave cream.  I shave more often and have less irritation than I did with Gillette razors--and I am saving a lot of money on replacement blades, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am almost ashamed to admit I was a victim of the marketing hype for Gillette for so long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:  I am downgrading to 4 stars.  After using this razor for over a month, I have found that while it is definitely a HUGE step up from any cartridge razor out there, it is definitely not the closest DE shaver you can choose.  It is a great beginner DE, if you are nervous about getting nicks and cuts.  It is very difficult to do a lot of damage to your face with this razor (if you are using proper technique).  But it will take 2-3 passes minimum to get a good close shave.  If you have sensitive skin like I do, each pass increases the irritation factor.  If you already have experience with DEs, there are better razors out there if you want a closer shave in fewer passes.</li>
    <li> I like this razor, it did take some getting use to. A bit on the large side but I am happy with it. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Little tricky to change the blade as you need to unscrew the handle and take a part a couple of pieces, but the price, balance and comfort way outweigh the cons.      I think I will be using this for a long-long while</li>
    <li> This razor was my first safety razor and i was a bit worried that i wouldnt know how to use it. When i recieved it in the mail i was so excited but kind of scared to try it. When i tried it i was like man this is easy you just have to let the razors weight do the work. Creates such a nice clean close and smooth shave that i instantly fell in love with it. Now i shave and after i feel like im ready to conquer the world. FEELS GOOD !!</li>
    <li> I recently bought this razor in an effort to live reduce one aspect of waste in our home. I read a lot of reviews and found this razor to be the most reasonably priced and saw that another woman found it to give her a really nice shave. So, I settled on it and really could not be more pleased. I think it achieves a closer shave than my previous favorite- the venus for women- and at a fraction of the cost! Additionally, this won&#x27;t leave me tossing plastic in the trash, which is a huge plus for me. This razor is incredible quality and could even be passed down to a second or third generation, if properly cared for. I won&#x27;t buy anything else from now on. Highly recommend it. :)</li>
    <li> Nice Razor.  Works well.  Very Very sharp.  Does a good job as well as my 5 blade razor at about a 10th of the cost.  I like the long handle and don&#x27;t find it difficult to use as others have mentioned.  Placing the blade in the razor was simple.  Yes it is sharp, but its a razor. What do you expect?  Overall I am very satisfied and would recommend it for someone else.</li>
    <li> I am not one to leave many reviews but this item compelled me to do so! I have suffered from razor bumps since my military enlistment. In basic training they give me Mach 3.....a terror on my face. That&#x27;s when the facial war started!  I&#x27;ve tried bump stop razors, electric shavers...even razor less gels....nothing seemed to work. Using bump fighter and others alike those harsh chemicals makes your skin darken. I decided to do some research and found that these safety razors cut so close there is no chance of the hair going back into the skin. It&#x27;s close enough to give you a perfect shave but not irritate the skin. Where the hell was this all my life...HAHAH! I been using mine for about 2 weeks and my face has never looked better!!! Bumps are gone, smooth skin...loving it! I&#x27;m about to order another for travel.</li>
    <li> Very nice razor. I went back to the old school way of shaving due to the expense of cartridges these days. The razors weight and longer handle feel very nice in hand.  It comes with a single blade which is very good, but I&#x27;m waiting on my &#x27;Feathers&#x27; to get here.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and the shave is as close and non-irritating as promised. I just wish that there was some indication in the packaging of how to get a blade on/off. For an inexperienced user, it took me about ten minutes of trying to screw the handle off before realizing that it&#x27;s only the head that needs to be unscrewed. Otherwise, this razor is top-notch.</li>
    <li> It has been a couple of weeks, now, since I had ordered this razor and - up until a few days ago - it had been resting proudly on its stand, in the bathroom.  My shaving soap soap was a bit delayed, in getting here and, besides, I still had a disposable to go through.  When the soap did arrive, that disposable was ready for retirement, and I out the Merkur into service, for the first time.  I heeded the advice about taking my time in getting the shaving task done, and found myself quite liking the involvement.  I made sure that I kept about a 30 degree tilt, and let the weight of the razor handle things, without applying any additional pressure.  This razor gave me a very close, comfortable shave, and (actually) did much better than even the 4-blade disposables that I had been using.  Cuts?  Well, I did cut myself - just once - but it wasn&#x27;t bad at all.  A short wipe of my styptic pencil took immediate care of that, and I think that the reason for the cut - in  the first place - was likely causative of an unintentional slip in the handling technique of this shaving tool.      So far, so good.  I seem to have come across a shaver that not only works (and works VERY WELL) for me, but I am also about to realize huge savings by not having to dig so deep in the pocket to meet those obscene prices of disposable shavers.  ................................................  UPDATE:    I am loving this shaving tool even more.  I have had the opportunity to get a few more shaves done, and the pleasurable aspect of going through the process is yet maintained.  One thing I have found is that my face will begin to itch, a little, on the second or third day after shaving.  But I (an African American) am quite relieved to find that I don&#x27;t bump up.  I had previously read, somewhere, how there is an acclimation process that some people may have to go through.  So, it seems to be quite clear that my face may have to just get used to this shaving technique.  And that is no issue for me.  I only mention it in the event that others may experience, and wonder about the same.      But again, I LOVE this shaver of mine.  It is one of the best purchases thati have ever made.</li>
    <li> I find the Mercur razor to have a great feel in my hand as it is metal with a chrome finish which provides the perfect amount of weight needed to shave my beard.  But being a straight razor, a few adjustments are necessary if switching from a disposable multi-blade razor as I did.  My three adjustments for this razor are: shaving angle, rinsing and shaving substrate.  Since the Mercur has a fix-angled blade, I have to hold the handle at a 30degree from my face to access the razor.  Too wide and you get the chrome head, too  shallow and you get the guard. Additionally, make sure to hold your skin taught and use only the weight of the razor to cut your beard; this will ensure you&#x27;re using a sharp razor.  Second, rinse the blade well; after filling each side of your razor with hair and shaving cream, run it under a strong stream of warm water (NOTE: hot water will make the Mercur very hot and may burn) to get it clean.  The razor is surprisingly easy to rinse clean.  Finally, I found that I had to switch from my normal gel shaving lotion, to a low foaming shaving cream.  I use Every Man Jack and it works quite well.  I also find it easier to shave after a shower; this does two things: cleans your beard and softens it.  All in all, the Mercur razor has been a great upgrade for me.  I find it to be balanced in my hand, providing the right amount of weight to shave my beard.  Plus the razor&#x27;s chrome finish keeps me looking classy.</li>
    <li> I just recently got into shaving with a double edge safety razor after a friend let me borrow his Gillette.  I am a big guy with big hands, so although I enjoyed using the razor, I knew I needed something longer in the handle.  This one did the trick.  It has made shaving a real pleasure. I have no complaints, but admit to having little in way of comparison.</li>
    <li> I grew up watching my father and grandfather use this type of razor.  Now that I have my first one, I have a nostalgic feeling when  shave.  I actually look forward to shaving and I know take my time shaving.  The Razor feels solid and heavy in the hand and I immediately realize this isn&#x27;t a  PLASTIC gillette SEVEN blade vibrating razor with an LED light with voice activation that you throw away...???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When buying this make sure you get the variety razor packs.  I used one and it didn&#x27;t feel all that great.  I used another and found the perfect razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head is smooth and feels great on the skin.  The handle is a bit thin for my big hand, but I can get used to it.  It cut so it doesn&#x27;t slip from your fingers, even when it&#x27;s wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is classy, solid, masculine, and shaves close.  It makes me feel like the art of shaving is coming back!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just keep in mind one thing, when you go to the old school barbers, how many blades do they use?  Just one.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent razor! I have Never used anything but plastic disposable razors for 40 years until now. Thought i&#x27;d try a double edge razor. Conclusion....i&#x27;ve been missing out of a great shave for 40 years! Will never go back!</li>
    <li> Cut myself several times and it doesn&#x27;t give as close a shave as I would like returned to using my Gillette Fusion  razor</li>
    <li> Great weight and feel.  This was my first safety razor and has made me a big fan.  I like shaving now :--)</li>
    <li> I am new to safety razors. This model had plenty of positive reviews so I tried it. Besides the handle being a bit shorter than I expected (Since this is the &#x27;long&#x27; handle model) the razor has been great. Don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ll buy one of those expensive Gillette four or five blade rip offs anymore.</li>
    <li> This razor is like a Ferrari: it does everything well, but be cautious as it&#x27;ll bite you if mishandled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My perspective is based on decades of using Gillette Mach-3 razors:&lt;br /&gt;The Merkur shaves very smoothly&lt;br /&gt;It shaves very closely&lt;br /&gt;It requires more time to shave because you have to pay attention to your shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A big up-side is cost: a Gillette Mach 3 cartridge costs $2, versus $0.20 for a regular safety blade, so roughly ten-times less cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus the Merkur would be analogous to a Ferrari, compared to Gillette&#x27;s Toyota-like qualities, except that the Ferrari costs a tenth of the cost of the Toyota.  Certainly worth a try for anybody with unwanted hair.</li>
    <li> Very satisfy with the order</li>
    <li> I already owned one of these before getting this one for my dad, because I wanted to start shaving in a way that my late grandfather would approve of. I could just imagine him watching me use a Mach 3 and making fun of what a sissy I am, not to mention what a waste of money the Mach 3 is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes about two days of getting over the fear of using it, but you will eventually build up some great confidence using this shaving tool and feel more like a real man than when you used your Mach 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Item arrived in the condition and quality I expected, and on time for Christmas. My dad thought it was really cool. These razors are built to last... I cannot fathom needing to replace anything but the blades in my entire life.</li>
    <li> Was tired of spending ridiculous amounts of money on Gillette razor cartridges. Brother in law recommended this. Found it in the mall for upwards of $80. This is the same product for much less money. Was worried I&#x27;d cut myself with it, but only nicked the first shave. Since then, it&#x27;s handled like a dream. I&#x27;m very excited about saving the money.</li>
    <li> I actually look forward to shaving in the morning since I bought this product. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Double edged (DE) razors don&#x27;t work like cartridge razors, and hence the grip is very different. I thought the long handle would suit my larger hands, but it doesn&#x27;t. With a DE razor I need more control, so tend to hold the razor closer to the blade anyway. The longer handle then only counters the balance (with the lever effect), making the razor less controllable.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the longer handle hits my face when shaving inside corners such as the neck... I basically &#x27;run out of runway&#x27;. This is frustrating because DE shaving is all about attaining a proper angle for the blade, and I quickly lose the angle I&#x27;ve concentrated so hard to achieve.&lt;br /&gt;I would never buy a long handle for another DE razor again. I am giving extra stars because this is a magnificently manufactured  razor from Germany. There is no questioning the quality.</li>
    <li> I wanted to use this razor for a while before writing a review.  I bought this razor in Nov 2013 and have been using it exclusively since then.  Installing a razor is very simple.  You simply unscrew the handle, then separate the two top guards and insert a blade between the two guards and screw the handle back on.  When I first used the razor, I got several tiny cuts on my face. I wasn&#x27;t sure what I did wrong. I looked at a few videos on YouTube on how to use a safety razor and they mentioned not applying any pressure when using the razor.  &amp;#34;Let the razor do the work.&amp;#34; So I tried that advice and still received a few tiny nicks on my face and neck.  As the weeks passed, I noticed that the nicks became less and less and it was easier to use.  I wasn&#x27;t really doing anything differently, so I thought it was the razor dulling.  So I installed a new razor after 2 weeks and low and behold, I still didn&#x27;t have any nicks.  My technique just got a lot better and I unknowingly just learned how to use the razor better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I will never go back to disposable razors that cost an arm and a leg.  This razor is amazing.  I get a close shave and only spend a fraction of what i used to spend.  I love this product and would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband.  A good halfway between regular razors and a true straight edge.  He loves it.  He thinks it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;work of art&amp;#34; and gets all excited when it&#x27;s time to put in a new blade.  It&#x27;s a great gift!  Go for it!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid of DE shaving!  I had no idea that &#x27;close shave&#x27; feel with cartridge razors was irritation.  I hated the feel of sheets against my shaved legs at night.  Well, no more now that I use a DE. I have only nicked myself once (my 3rd time and I was going fast with cheap Williams soap).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The long handle makes it easier to shave legs.  Its weight is just right so that you remember to let it do the work for you (don&#x27;t use pressure).  I have dropped it, and it appears unscathed, not even a scratch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go to YouTube and watch the lady from Razor Emporium.  Watching their videos was the most helpful thing I did.  They will teach you about preparation and technique.</li>
    <li> I initially started by purchasing a really cheap DE shaving set: razor, shaving stick, boar brush &amp; blades.  I quickly found out the set was pretty crappy overall,  but great at causing cuts big &amp; small leading to massive blood loss.  The Arko shaving stick was great, as were the derby blades.  I still use both. But the cheap butterfly razor was really tearing me up.  So I read a lot of the great reviews here, and picked the Merkur 180.  I really like this razor and look forward to shaving with it. This is not an aggressive cutter, relatively forgiving. In all fairness though, you have to take your time when shaving with a DE razor. For workdays I use an electric because I can shave in the shower and it&#x27;s quick.  But I really like the weekends when I can enjoy shaving.  This razor with derby blades, badger brush and arko shaving stick really works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I finish with the Sandalwood After-Shave balm from Art of Shaving.</li>
    <li> This razor is very high quality and definitely has the &amp;#34;heft&amp;#34; I was looking for. The long handle is very nice. It really feels good in your hand!</li>
    <li> I believe you only get one blade which apparently isn&#x27;t their best line of blades. I&#x27;m not sure where the long handle idea comes from because its rather small</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little tricky to get used to shaving underarms with a safety razor, but after about two weeks, I&#x27;ve got it down. I switched to a safety razor because my husband is a big fan and insisted that it would help with reducing the razor burn I get with disposable razors and razor blades. It hasn&#x27;t eliminated the issue completely, but I&#x27;ve seen a big difference. Plus, it&#x27;s so much cheaper to buy razor blades!</li>
    <li> I recently made the switch from shaving with disposable Gillette Mach 3 razors to this little safety razor and I&#x27;m not going back.  The Merkur is of decent quality and adequate enough to remove even the most stubborn of your little stubbles. The cost for using a safety razor is far cheaper than a disposable -thats why I&#x27;m using it. Another noteworthy benefit to these razors is that the blades are more environmentally sustainable. So, don&#x27;t be a D-bag and save yourself some bucks and make Captain Planet proud- buy a safety razor. Go planet! - I really hated that cartoon.</li>
    <li> After you learn how to use it it gives a good shave you can&#x27;t just shave the same as with a disposable razor</li>
    <li> This razor should easily last a life time and then some.  Shave is close and comfortable, disassembly is simple and allows for easy cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parts fit together solidly and show no signs of play.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas last year.  He loves it.  It&#x27;s been our first experience with this kind of razor, and there is a little bit of an adjustment period.  I say &amp;#34;our first experience&amp;#34; because I use it too.  There were frequent nicks in the beginning, but after you get the hang of it, you wonder how you ever paid for those ridiculously priced razor cartridges before.  The blades for this thing are so cheap.  You can order them on amazon or we just get them at Sally&#x27;s.  We&#x27;ll never go back.</li>
    <li> Quality is excellent. Razor is well balanced and easy to use.Easy to change blades and looks good. The end is open which i think should be closed.</li>
    <li> This was my husbands Christmas gift. He is very happy with it. Razor is well made and exactly what he wanted. He said it gives a great close shave, no nicks or cuts and glides across his face. He said it is well balanced and he really likes the long handle. No cons for this one....Shipping was fast, packed well and arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Razor functions well. However, the plating is defective and i have rust on the handle. The razor forums on the web indicate the manufacturer offers no assistance.</li>
    <li> I received this as a Christmas gift, complete with a shaving brush, shave soap, after shave and blades. A few years ago, I switched from cartridge razors to a Panasonic electric razor, but was ready to try this &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; shaving setup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first few weeks, I used the safety razor exclusively. However, after watching a few Youtube tutorial videos on safety razors, I noticed a tutorial where shaving was done in multiple passes; i.e. a first pass to get the stubble, then a 2nd (and possibly 3rd pass) to get the close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several weeks ago, I switched back to using my electric razor for the 1st pass, then finishing up with the safety razor. I quickly remove the stubble with the electric, then get a close/finished shave with the safety razor. Using the safety razor for the 2nd pass, I&#x27;ve also been less prone to have nicks and cuts. I&#x27;ve also switched back to regular shaving cream, but still finish up with Club Man after shave. For me, I feel like this setup and method is the best of both worlds. I get the speed of an electric razor, the closeness of a safety razor, and the cost effectiveness of both.</li>
    <li> If you are considering getting away from the new-age razor and switching to a razor that will give you a real shave look no farther. This was the first one i bought and it is working great. these things last forever as I have my grandfathers that still works (different brand but i expect the same of this)</li>
    <li> I have been shaving with Gillette Fusion Power razors prior to this.  I got sick of seeing prices go up and up for blades, at last check almost $16 for four blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took a chance and bought this.  I am so glad I did.  WIth refills at $8 for a pack of 10 it won&#x27;t break the bank yet it is so simple and rugged in it&#x27;s design that the shave is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it is a metal razor so it is heavier than a modern plastic piece of garbage, but it is also much much more durable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say a few things that helped me with my transition to a different type of razor after so many years: 1.  Be patient and take your time....it&#x27;s sharp....not enough to bleed out, but you can cut yourself.  2.  moisten your face and the first few times you shave expect to have to repeat as the hair follicles on your face have grown in relation to your previous method.  3.  Give it 3-4 shaves and I am sure you will agree it is perhaps the closest shave you have had in a very long time!</li>
    <li> Within a week, most of my in skin grown hair almost gone.&lt;br /&gt;Do not have serious issue with it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good grasp, high quality build. use it almost every day.</li>
    <li> I love this safety razor!  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month along with a sample package of blades from various manufacturers.  As far as the razor goes, the weight feels good in my hands, it&#x27;s easy to rinse and switch out blades.&lt;br /&gt;I feel better about knowing Im not throwing out plastic cartridges every week, and that I don&#x27;t have to rely on one manufacturer to continue to sell my blade cartridge refills.  I can&#x27;t tell you have annoying  it was to see my husband&#x27;s Mach 3 razors in stock, but find out the Venus razor cartridges were changing AGAIN.  I just want to have some consistency.&lt;br /&gt;I get a consistent and smooth shave on my legs, armpits, and bikini line using this safety razor (combined with a good blade). Shaving cream is a must to avoid nicks - especially on my shins and ankles.  I takes a little bit of time to get used to it, but I never got as smooth a shave with any other razor.  There&#x27;s a lot to be said for using one sharp blade instead of three crappy Gillette blades.  Less skin irritation for sure.</li>
    <li> This is my third purchase of a Merker razor, second for the long handled model.  I am still in love with this razor and had to spread the word to my family.  I purchased one for my father this Christmas and he told me &amp;#34;This is the kind of razor I learned how to shave with!&amp;#34;  I think we&#x27;ve got another convert.</li>
    <li> This is my first and only safety razor thus far. I anticipate it&#x27;ll be my only one, and I mean that in the best way possible. What can I say, it&#x27;s solid metal and there is nothing to break. It&#x27;s got a nice heavy feel to it that I love. But the most important thing is how well it shaves, right? I don&#x27;t know how this razor would compare to other safety razors, but I know that I&#x27;ve never felt a shave as good as this razor has been able to provide me with. If you&#x27;re not sure about the whole wet shaving, DE/Safety razor concept, just know what you&#x27;re getting yourself into. It&#x27;s not the same as shaving with a disposable or an electric. It&#x27;s just not, and you need to know how to do it properly or I really doubt you&#x27;ll like this one bit. Learn the proper technique and decide if it&#x27;s for you, then go get this razor, because there is nothing to regret about this particular product in and of itself.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t often write reviews but after reading the great reviews about Merkur razors I thought I have to review this for others as well and let them know that this is the best shaving device out there.     I have been shaving for about 15 years now and the only thing I knew was Gillette. You name it the best and most recent blade they had I got. Then for the past year I had been researching what constitutes the perfect shave. There are many other factors but for shaving wise everyone always mentions the use of a single blade razor and not the multi-blade razor. For the most part multi-blade razors (Mach 3, Fusion, Fusion Pro Glide)cut the hair below the surface in the skin and cut it in an angle....thus when the hairs grow back you are more likely to get ingrown hairs. I get a few of these ingrowns in the neck area after a few days from shaving.     The Merkur 180 itself is a strong great looking piece. As others mention it has a little weight to it so the weight of the blade will do all the shaving, so there is no pulling from your end. You will be proud to display such a safety razor on your shaving stand.     Now lets get to the results. I purchased the Derby Stainless Steel blades as I read that they perform well. You will have to find a blade that is right for you.....I would recommend you buy a variety pack first to see which you prefer. Buy a variety pack that has more prominent blade manufacturers (Derby, Feather, Astra, Merkur 7am, etc...)    With my very first shave I had an extremely comfortable and close shave. I could not believe it but there simply was no more razor burn during the shave, second and third day irritation from the hair growing back, and yes no more ingrown hairs. These devices precisely cut the hair at the right length and in the right angle. I did a two pass shave....one with the grain and then one against the grain.....all I needed for a close and comfortable shave.     I know many men and women out there simply don&#x27;t know the benefitsof our grandfathers shaving days....they get drawn in with these fancy commercials from gillette and Schick. Take it from me a 15 year Gillette user who will not be going back.    AND HERE IS THE BIGGEST KICKER. THE MULTI-BLADES TODAY COST ALMOST 4 DOLLARS A BLADE (FUSION PRO-GLIDE). YOU CAN BUY DIFFERENT PACKS OF BLADES THAT WILL LAST FOR YEARS AND COST MINIMAL WHEN COMPARED TO THE BIG CORPORATE BOYS.    I WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH ONE FINAL THOUGHT. With the economic downturn in 08 Gillette began a new marketing campaign not improving their blade but rather letting the consumer know that when your gel strip on the top turns white it means you need to replace it with a new blade. If you can remember and I do since I have been using Gillette from day one....they first advertised that the strip was not a blade indicator rather it was a gel strip that provided extra lubrication for a more comfortable shave. Now ofcourse within a couple of shaves the gel on the strip will be gone exposing the white strip background.     Gillette and Schick make a living on selling blades....not their shaving sticks but blades (same concept of printers, the printer is cheap compared to the costs of buying toner, drum, or ink cartridges)I felt that with the economic downturn in 08 people simply could not afford to keep buying their extremely high priced blades so people kept shaving on a blade that was still doing its job and probably shaving with the blade for longer periods of time. Gillette must have immediately realized this decline in sales and launched the commercial for the blade indicator strip. It was nothing new from their first commercials stating it was a gel strip.     I picked it up from the very first commercial and remember telling my father about it and thought wow...wow they really would do this to the general public just for the bottom line. This is simply my opinion and many of you may have thought the same. I would love to hear your comments about it.     Overall I am not here to talk about Gillette&#x27;s marketing strategy, rather that Merkur is the best shaving device to go with. This past Gillette user is never going back. I have the CLOSEST and most COMFORTABLE shave with the Merkur line.     Hope this review was helpful.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this razor. This is the second razor I have purchased and the quality is excellent.</li>
    <li> I am new to DE shaving.  I bought my Merkur 180 along with 100 Derby blades.  This razor comes with 1 Merkur blade.  The Derby blade cut my facial hair much easier than the Merkur blade.  I am excited about perfecting my DE shaving skills.  This razor is a true investment.  I experience less irritation by using this razor VS. traditional disposable razors.  It will also save me money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE***12/13/11&lt;br /&gt;This razor is such a great value.&lt;br /&gt;I am a very proud owner.&lt;br /&gt;My life feels more complete, now that I have this razor.&lt;br /&gt;I feel like singing.....:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE***5/3/12&lt;br /&gt;I always rinse out my blade, halfway through each pass.&lt;br /&gt;Or, you could also simply use the other edge of the razor, halfway through each pass.&lt;br /&gt;By cleaning my blades after each half pass, I experience less tug and thereafter razor burn.</li>
    <li> I hate multi-blade razors because they give me horrible razorburn. Because of this, I was limited to the single-blade disposable razors that shave about as well as a pocketknife. I purchased a Merkur safety razor after reading many of the reviews. I shaved with it the day I received it. My wife watched me because she was sure that I would be covered in cuts. She was wrong. There was no learning curve for me; I simply let the razor do the work. I will never go back to disposable razors.</li>
    <li> For years, I watched how men in the classic movies would shave, which intrigued me as a kid.  Lately, I had been contemplating the idea to change the way I shave, especially after my improved experiece with a Mach 3 razor. Then, I happened across the website: artofmanliness.com, which has many great articles, several of those discussing old school shaving and barbershops, which peaked my interest. I first purchased the inexpensive Van Der Hagen Premium shave bowl, boar brush and soap set, not spending much in case I did not want to stick to shaving the classic way, knowing how I have gone through little phases in life. Well, I was pleased with the results, a great shave with absolutely no cuts, using my Mach 3 blades.  However, since I received the razor and blades for free, I was not looking forward to paying the price for new ones.  Plus, after researching safety razors, I thought the Merkur 180 Long Handled razor looked beautiful, was reasonably priced and received great reviews.  Since the safety razors by Merkur all looked so small, a \\&quot;long handle\\&quot; was required for my semi-large hands. The final sell was the small amount of waste and low cost involved with using double edge blades.  I excitedly opened the package when it came (In fact, Amazon got it here earlier than the estimated time, good job, Amazon!).  I pulled it out and used it right away, with the Merkur blade that came with it.  I cut myself slightly, so, I was disappointed. But, I knew I needed to learn how to use it, so I read what others suggested.  I realized I just needed to hold the blade at an angle, taking shorter strokes while allowing the weight of the razor to shave, rather than apply as much pressure from my hand. You really need to take your time with this, gentlemen.  If you are in a rush in the mornings, stick with the Mach 3.  But, it is worth it to wake up 20 minutes earlier to enjoy this experience.  You get a nice, close shave, enjoy shaving like a man and change what once was a hindrance into a joy to start your day.</li>
    <li> I really like this razor more than its little chubby brother the Merkur 34C, I enjoy the weight and craftsmanship of this razor, my only complaint is I wish it had the chrome job that Edwin Jagger has done to it&#x27;s razors</li>
    <li> Just Switched to DE Shaving , and this Razor gives me the best Shaves i have ever had.  I use this with  Taylor Old Bond Street creams and a Silvertips Badger Brush.  I look forward to every morning i can wake up and shave</li>
    <li> The long handle makes it easier to hold.  This is the best safety razor that I&#x27;ve used. If you&#x27;re looking for a great razor to start traditional shaving with, this is the one!</li>
    <li> Would have given this razor five stars, but it comes with virtually no instructions.  We looked on-line for care and feeding of razor.</li>
    <li> Excellent razor, great transaction!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for the guy in my life. He likes it, but has yet to try it.&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;re both new to wet shaving so take my review with a grain of salt. I also purchased a badger hair brush. I tried it out myself with the included merkur blade. It works BETTER on my legs then even a fusion. Takes a bit longer, but totally worth it. Shaving is no longer a chore.&lt;br /&gt;The weight is good, I wish it was heavier? I did want the long handle though, since both me and SO have long fingers.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also not as aggresive as I thought it would be after reading reviews. Thats good though, since I&#x27;m still learning.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor to substitute for my Dovo Straight Edge during the weekday since it was taking up time in the morning I didn&#x27;t have.  It works flawlessly, quickly, and efficiently.  The razor has a long handle, which is perfect for my larger hands.  When done right it&#x27;s quick and leaves my face feeling great for the rest of the day.  That doesn&#x27;t have to necessarily do with the Merkur though.  The Razor itself is well made from quality steel and consists of three separate parts which fit together perfectly.  This is a simple razor.  No gimmicks or tricks, or anything like that.  It also came with one Merkur razor, which was of good quality.  I would suggest this to anyone looking to get into Wet Shaving, or anyone who wants another trustworthy razor in their collection.</li>
    <li> My first safety razor, good quality. I can&#x27;t imagine using a short handled one, so glad I bought this one.</li>
    <li> Good, high quality razor.  I&#x27;m still learning to use it correctly but it works well.  Seems to tug on my face less than cartridge razors.  Takes a little more time.  But it is really classy.  One thing I didn&#x27;t realize was that the whole head screws off.  It&#x27;s not a one piece solution like the butterfly ones that have the head split in half.  But meh.  Works well, looks good.  I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to grip the handle to take off the safety guide.</li>
    <li> i owe my discovery of this fine tool to Gillette, that has simply outraged me with their price gouging.  Why pay $3.00 for a five blade cartridge that is engineered to last the shortest possible time?  When I first tried the Gillette Fusion, the sample blades lasted me three months.  Then I notice that they are only lasting a week or two.  Then I learn that the sample blades are manufactured differently than the replacement blades, made to last - one or two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I searched for alternatives, and came across the suggestion that one use the old fashioned razor.  Why did I ever give it up?  What is so sexy about a five blade cartrige, that can&#x27;t even touch the hairs under your nose?  I started having some bad bleeds from the cartridge blades.  I have to mention the motivation.  One can buy one of these, and a pack of 100 blades for under $10 (plus th cost of the safety razor, $35-$40 for a very well made tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE IT!  I NOW ENJOY THE ART OF SHAVING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i get a better shave, for a fraction of the cost.  There is something fun and artisan about the art of shaving, not at all tedious like I had imagined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try, especially if you want to get rid of the blood and the gouge marks, and spend your money on something besides replacing cheap cartridges.</li>
    <li> Love this Razor. Easy to use, Blades are cheap and I change them more often now. I would rather pay more for a quality shaving Razor and less for a quality Razor Blade. Shaves much closer than any other Razor I have used to include almost all of the Big Brands that will make the Razor cheap and then cash in on the Blade refills. Reminds me of watching my Grandfather shave when I was a kid. Very good product and the best way to shave!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for 6 months now and only changed the razor once.  As a woman who only shaves armpits once or twice a week, this thing has already saved me buckets of money on disposable.  Not to mention it doesn&#x27;t rust and can be recycled for money back.</li>
    <li> Fits my large hands well, seems very well made although changing blades could be easier or different.  No case with the razor.  Seemed a bit expensive.</li>
    <li> I bought  this because I heard the rave reviews of it and I&#x27;ve never used a single blade before. I bought a 10 pack of Merkur blades with it. At first I wasn&#x27;t sure how to shave with it but then I slowly figured it out. I think my major gripe is that the blades don&#x27;t last as long only about two to three shaveswhere my regular razors would last at least double or triple that. I guess the merkur system is just not for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using cartridges for years up until I purchased this in the autumn- I&#x27;ve been missing out not only on a better shave but at a financial lifesaver! Speaking for the razor itself, it&#x27;s simple and easy to break down for cleaning or changing blades. The included razor isn&#x27;t too shabby either. Overall I&#x27;d highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for less than a year. I love shaving with a safety razor, but the chrome is peeling. Bummer.</li>
    <li> First safety razor, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> I will never go back to any other razor, period. If you haven&#x27;t ever tried one of these you have no idea what you&#x27;re missing, both shave wise, which is AMAZING, and price wise. How we ever got away from this perfection to paying out the nose prices for disposable razors with 10 blades... I&#x27;ll never know, but boy was the wool pulled over our eyes. Couple this with a shave oil and a package of Personna blades and it can&#x27;t be beat. Just get over your fear of it being a razor without all the bells and whistles, no spring action, no multi-blade head, no gel gliding strip... they&#x27;re all marketing gimmicks to steal your hard earned cash.</li>
    <li> easy to use  smooth shave</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s got a great, heavy feel to it that instantly lets you know this isn&#x27;t a cheap, disposable or cartridge razor. Very easy to clean and put new blades in. If you&#x27;re like I was switching over to this from a Fusion Proglide or the like, worry not, it&#x27;s a breeze learning how to use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really the only difference is that you need to shave with several, short strokes instead of dragging your razor (which you should be doing with your cheap razors anyway), and you just tilt it till you find the angle that shaves best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Always start by shaving with the grain. As I have sensitive skin, I then do a 90 degree angle to the grain to get it closer, and finally against the grain if I want a super close shave. Love my Merkur.</li>
    <li> I have always used Norelco rotary electric shavers because the shave closer for my heavy beard than the other electric brands, and blade razors caused me too much bloodshed.  But I decided to try a single blade safety razor again and chose this one because of the excellent reviews.  It is perfectly designed for perfect close shaves with ease, safety and much closer than the electrics.  There is virtually no five o&#x27;clock shadow.  It is not adjustable because it does not needcto be, it is perfect as is.</li>
    <li> Overall this is a good razor.  Nothing complicated about it.  I just started wet shaving after a suggestion from a friend.</li>
    <li> Why have I spent most of my adult life wasting money on those stupid multi-blade razors that are ridiculously expensive?  This razor gives me a very close shave, doesn&#x27;t get all clogged up with hair and soap like those multi-blade razors do, and the blade lasts about 10 times longer than today&#x27;s &amp;#34;wonder razors&amp;#34;.  Grandpa had it right 70 years ago.  Maybe modern multi-blades make a difference if you have an extremely heavy beard, but for a normal schlub like me this razor is simple, works great, and will save me a fortune in the long run.</li>
    <li> Although I&#x27;ve been shaving for years, I am new to double-edge shaving.  I purchased this razor after reading raving reviews, but was uncertain of whether to get the long or short handle version.  I am glad I got the long as it is more similar to the feel I&#x27;m used to and I have large hands (XL glove size).  I learned the proper technique of holding this razor from shaving101.com and I am very happy with the purchase.  The razor comes with sample Merkur blades, but I ended up ordering some blade sample packs online.  Through trial and error, I narrowed the blade choice down to my favorite - Feather.  Combined with a favorite shave cream &amp; aftershave (I prefer Wm. Neumann &amp; Co.), this razor makes for a wonderful shaving experience.</li>
    <li> Every man should own and use one of these. They&#x27;re better than disposable plastic razors in every possible category. I definitely recommend the long handled version as well. It will fit comfortably in every hand whereas the shorter handles can easily be too short for many people.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent quality DE razor. The workmanship and fit/finish is grade A. The handle is obviously longer than a standard razor, but it is pencil thin. I happen to like this setup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, its a fairly mild cutting razor, meaning it is forgiving to a newby in DE shaving. I am very pleased with how it cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this razor and you will not be disappointed by its quality.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent razor.  I have been completely satisfied and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a double edge razor.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor. I have tried and used all the other fancy uptown razors but this beats them all. Super smooth close shave. Last night I used one of my older double blade razors and had more nicks than I ever get this new one.</li>
    <li> OK razor. Can shed hair anywhere fast. A safety razor like this deserves more stars because it promotes clean cuts and less scabs each use.</li>
    <li> Best razor ever  have!! I love it!!!</li>
    <li> It is a solid product. It is in three pieces so you can clean it easily. It is held together by a threaded handle. That means the razor blade is pinned down tight.</li>
    <li> I feel like a total idiot spending $4 a cartridge for my ProGlide when this elegant, insanely cost-effective solution has been waiting for me since...well...the last century!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first purchased the shorter version of this razor but, even with my smaller hands, found the handle a bit short.  This one works wonderfully.  A shave as close as anything else I&#x27;ve tried, and with a touch of old-world charm to boot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take your time when shaving, my friend.  Use a shaving brush.  Enjoy the process and feel what it&#x27;s like to embrace a manly bit of history that I can only hope is resurgent.  Start your day with class!</li>
    <li> My first safety razor, and i must admit that I do love using it. First off, as a safety razor, you can go over the same spot multiple times and still not get razor burn the way you will with cartridge multi-blade razors. People say that it&#x27;s easier to cut yourself with safety razors, but I actually find that I can work the razor better, and have only cut myself once or twice in the first 7-8 times. I more attribute those to learning the technique (youtube it or artofmanliness.com if you&#x27;re nervous about it). I also greatly appreciate that the razors cost about a quarter, as opposed to nearly $2.00 a cartridge. It&#x27;s a bit of an investment up front, but the cost of replacement of the razors means you will be saving yourself money within a year&#x27;s time.&lt;br /&gt;Also, there is just something more manly feeling about shaving with a heavy duty tool like this than those cheap plastic razors.</li>
    <li> Well, here we go. I&#x27;ve been using this compact little razor for about a year now, and I have zero complaints about it. Just a perfect tool for the job. It is well-built, simple, versatile, and has a good weight to it despite its compact proportions.&lt;br /&gt;I buy very sharp blades to use with it, and replace them every few shaves. I couldn&#x27;t recommend this thing more highly -- it&#x27;s saved me a gross amount of money (just a disgusting amount) over toss able shavers, and it doesn&#x27;t rip and do weird things to your hair like an electric razor. It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> Best razor I ever got, worth the investment!</li>
    <li> Great shave, never going back to multiblade crap again.</li>
    <li> Shaves incredibly close, and that is with just soap or regular shaving cream.  Plan to get a brush and shaving cream more appropriate for this blade to see what happens.  Also, replacement blades are $0.50 or less...now that makes sense!</li>
    <li> I grew up on these things, got caught up in the disposable blade years and now back.  I shouldn&#x27;t have ever left this type of shaving.  I bought another good brand with short handle and it was never comfortable.  This long handle one is fantastic!  I coupled it with Derby blades, don&#x27;t ever use cheap blades as it makes an incredible difference.  I use cheap dollar store cream and it works good but for a nice shave I switch to a gel cream.  This type of razor is shaves best with gels or creams not foams or gel that turns to foam.</li>
    <li> I saved tons of money with this razor. After spending so much on Gillete mach series, then their fusion.. etc. I finally tried this. And i cant recommend it enough! The featherlight blades that i now purchase, i get a closer shave, no cuts since i throw the blades away sooner, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: Do NOT apply pressure when this razor handle. It is heavy metal... and will do the work for you!</li>
    <li> This morning was my fourth shave with this razor (used in conjunction with [[ASIN:B002O7UI18 Proraso/C.O. Bigelow Menthol Shave Cream with Eucalyptus Oil-5.2oz]],  [[ASIN:B000G647Y8 Tweezerman  Men&#x27;s Shaving Brush]] and [[ASIN:B000053L6Y Clubman Pinaud After Shave Lotion, 6 Ounce]]) and I could not be happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first attempt was a little rough as I adjusted from the Gillette Fusion 5-blade monstrosity I had been wasting my money on for years, but each subsequent shave has gotten easier once I got the hang of the mechanics of the safety razor.  I&#x27;m 34 and had never known anything but disposable blades, but I&#x27;m kicking myself for not making the switch sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be experimenting with a few different blades just to see if there are any I like better than the Merkur that came with the razor, but all-in-all, I&#x27;m thrilled.</li>
    <li> I simply love this razor for my face. It&#x27;s forgiving and shaves close. I have yet to cut myself at all, if you know how to use one of those pathetic disposable razors you can use this. I will never go back to those throw aways. This is the only way to go. It seems like it&#x27;s pricey at first but if you crunch the numbers shaving this way is cheaper and closer than any other razor I have ever used. I picked up an old 50&#x27;s razor for giggles and still this razor is hands down better. Great buy and will last a lifetime. Buy this, you know you want to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After trying many different types of vintage razors I have found this razor is still my go to razor. I&#x27;ve tried techs, super speeds, fatboys and slims and this razor hands down works best. I still can&#x27;t believe how smooth it shaves. I&#x27;ve used soaps and creams and both work well. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this razor. No regrets at all with this one.</li>
    <li> I just transitioned from the cartridge razors so I do not have much to say as I do not have much to compare it to. The blades I bought were personnas and I am very happy. They shave better than cartridge razors and the razor is nice and solid. It is easy to replace the blades as well.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this with Proraso Shaving Soap in Eucalyptus and Menthol and a brush and it is the ONLY thing that can give him an immaculate shave without irritating his sensitive skin.  It only took a try or two to get a hang of it.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for an alternative to the disposable razors for over a year, and came across this a few weeks.  Not only is this product high quality, but the shave is the best I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Very well-made.  Nice weight.  Great, mild DE razor.  This was my first DE razor and provided a little forgiveness for the beginner.  Have used many vintage DE razors since, and this one ranks up there with the best.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor and I have had it for several months now. Absolutely love the switch choice I made from those multi-blade razors to this. I plan on having this for years to come and would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Simply love it.  Well balanced and quality all the way.</li>
    <li> Awesome razor. Perfectly weighted.</li>
    <li> this is the best thing i&#x27;ve purchased in awhile. i&#x27;d been thinking about doing so as to reduce waste and hopefully get a better shave than what i was getting from my drugstore razors.  so worth the initial investment. close shave every time. get one ladies!</li>
    <li> utter junk save your money.....what ever happened to Gillette razors? impossible to get a close shave.</li>
    <li> I got this as my first razor, so currently I&#x27;m not shaving anything more than fluff every two weeks, but it&#x27;s a very clean shave that leaves your face feeling refreshed, not chewed up like those nasty electric razors. And yes, you must use aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great investment, I&#x27;ve had it for several months, and it still looks new. I hope to be using for the next couple years!</li>
    <li> This is a decent starter razor if you&#x27;re not sure about the whole safety razor thing. The head is the same as the more expensive models but the handle is light and kind of cheap looking/feeling. If you can afford it buy the heavier models, it makes a difference. I loved my electric but would often get razor burn. Safety razors give a better shave and is a nice ritual. Mucho nostalgia...</li>
    <li> This razor is awesome, I didn&#x27;t think I would like it but I love it. I shave pretty much every day (usually skip weekends), I&#x27;ve had this for a little over a month with absolutely no issues. Thought I might cut myself or get skin irritations from this but I&#x27;m glad to say I&#x27;ve done/had neither. It can be a little scary to change the blades, not that it&#x27;s difficult or anything but because they are so thin and sharp I always think I will cut myself. I think as long as you take your time and are careful, everything will be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a long time user of Gillette razers (disposables at first, then mach 3) but they were getting way too expensive. I switched to Dorco razors (same ones found on &amp;#34;dollar shave club&amp;#34;) but I didn&#x27;t really enjoy shaving with them. I use this razor with the &amp;#34;Proraso Shaving Soap, Eucalyptus &amp; Menthol&amp;#34; and I love it! Didn&#x27;t think a single blade would give me a clean, smooth shave but it does.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what the fuss is about with the cuts.  I get less than I did with the Mach 3.  It has paid for itself in under a month.</li>
    <li> Handle is a bit smaller than I was thinking but still would recommend.</li>
    <li> This product has a wonderful weight to it, allowing the razor to smoothly operate on the skin.  The textured shaft of the razor is a nice feature, however only moderately effective when hands are wet.  Changing razors is incredibly easy, and one notices the quality of the manufacturing and materials used.</li>
    <li> After growing up using cartridge razors, I decided to check out the old-school safety razor system two years ago. The improvement in my skin and shaves has been fantastic. Within two weeks, all those razor-burn bumps along my neckline were GONE and have never returned.  It takes a little practice learning to use a safety razor like this--it&#x27;s heavy, so DON&#x27;T PUSH DOWN on your skin, let the weight handle that.  You&#x27;ll nick yourself on the edges at first until you get the hang of it, but that never happens anymore. I actually enjoy my morning shave now--my routine is to:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)heat up a coffee mug of hot water for 2 minutes in the microwave,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2)dunk the brush into it as I hop in the shower (if I am using a shaving soap like Colonel Conk&#x27;s, I first drop some water on that to let it soften)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3)after drying off from my shower, I lather up the brush and apply (which feels great and opens up the pores--hot foam is the way to go and smells pretty good too)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) shave a four-inch section of my face, then twirl around the razor and do another four-inch section using the opposite side (learn the different grains of your beard and go with the grain--along my neckline it actually goes up). Rinse the razor in the mug of water and do the next sections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) lather up again and go over my face once more&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6) wipe down my face and apply a manly-smelling but moisturizing aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll smell better, get a better shave, better skin, and this is way cheaper than cartridge crap but feels like pampering yourself. Make the switch. BTW I use the Shark Razors, the 100 pack lasts me about 1.5 years for ~$20.</li>
    <li> The product is extremely well built, feels high quality, however I had to knock off 2 stars and hoping the seller can send me a blade. The shipping was done by a 5 year old. It was not packaged in a \\&quot;box\\&quot; per se but in card board wrapped up to simulate a box. When I opened it the product box was also squished and damaged, leaving me to believe the blade must have fell out during UPS shipping. (yea I saw this guy outside dropping boxing outside the truck).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, the blade would not have fallen out have the box been properly sealed. Please contact me and send me a razor to test.</li>
    <li> I recently started shaving with a DE Safety Razor.  I was previously shaving with a Gillette Fusion Proglide.  I was a little skeptical about how well it would shave.  I was extremely surprised that the shave was much better than the old cartridge style i have been using since high school.  No irritation or razor burn and it is a great way to start your day.  I now look forward to shaving.  I definitely recommend this Razor as a first razor as it is forgiving yet provides that smooth shave with no pulling of the facial hair.</li>
    <li> I bought the Merker 180 ( long handle version) on Amazon for about 32 bucks. It was the best shaving investment I ever made. If you demand a close shave, this is the way to go. For more than a decade I was using Norelco style electric shavers but never could get a perfect shave. Also, the tri blade heads were very expensive to replace. Decided to try this product. Very smooth shave as long as you wash your face and use a quality shaving cream.. No pressure needed and no razor burn or nicks afterwards. I clean and rinse the blade and unit after every use and the razor blade lasts about a month before I change it. Those of you who have thick facial hair that grows very fast may need to change the blades more frequently. I highly recommend the Merker brand blades that come with it but any standard double edge blades will work with this unit. if you are a person who demands a close shave and someone who appreciates an exceptional quality made product, you need to get one of these. It will change the way you think and feel about shaving. This is the Mercedes Benz of Double Edge Safety Razors for men who demand the closest shave.</li>
    <li> Highly recommended! We bought this razor to replace a low quality safety razor from another company. My husband loves this one!</li>
    <li> This blade is NOT better than the Gilette razors with multiple blades. Not even close. You can&#x27;t get around the nose easily, it pulls your hair soooo painfully when shaving and leaves pleny of hair on your face. There is no learning curve, this razor is just horrible. Complete waste of money. It&#x27;s in my trash. Buy a Gilette Fusion. It shaves any area like a champ, doesn&#x27;t pull your hair out,  shaves SO smoothly leaving no extra hair and goes one step further. It has a battery for a virating shave. Try it once and you won&#x27;t think it&#x27;s stupid. It&#x27;s awesome!!! Just try it once, the vibrating shave makes it so much more enjoyable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUY THIS ITEM AT YOUR OWN PERIL.  COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY.  DON&#x27;T BELIEVE THE HYPE!!!!</li>
    <li> Did not give me a good shave.  It felt like I did not shave at all.  I tried different blades with no luck.</li>
    <li> This review is in relation to the price, and this is my first safety razor.  I have been shaving with the razor for two weeks and am extremely pleased with my purchase.  The sturdiness of the product thus far is exceptional.  I was expecting something lighter and less quality for some reason, but the welcome heftiness and solid build of the razor make me think it will hold up for a long time.  I am interested in how well the tightness of the handle, which is screwed off/on every time a blade is replaced, will hold up.  I don&#x27;t expect it to be a problem, but it is one aspect that might impact my review down the road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle has a great grip to it.  Even though the razor is heavy-ish, the good grip and longer handle prevent any fumbling (for me, this might be the case for everyone).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price that the product is currently being offered at, at the time of the review ~$34 it is well worth the purchase in my novice opinion.  I just switched over to using a safety razor, and this was my first razor.  (with the blade that came in the box) It performed impeccably.  For me, it didn&#x27;t feel like it was shaving.  I was amazing when I felt the surface over my skin and it was completely smooth.  This might be a normal aspect of safety razor, but it was very different than the feeling of the disposable tripe-razor I had been using for years.  This led to my skin actually feeling better afterwards.  Also, my aftershave sting level definitely kicked up a notch.  I *presume* this is indicative of a closer shave.  Not certain though.  It was a great and fulfilling feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and will probably buy this for my son who is just getting to the age of needing to shave.</li>
    <li> No complaints. This seems to be working quite well. Everything is as I expected. It comes with one blade but I&#x27;m glad I remembered to order the blades and stand as well.</li>
    <li> This was my first safety razor after giving up on my 20-year-old Gillette Sensor.  It is excellent for shaving my head and face.  The razor is light and easy to hold and works well with the contours of my face.</li>
    <li> This is a high quality razor.  If you are new to Safety Razor shaving this is a good razor to start with.  It&#x27;s reasonably priced and offers excellent quality for the price.</li>
    <li> Everything you could ask for in a razor. Simple, easy to clean, gets the job done (better than most) and inexpensive. Save money by buying some good DE razors and then carry on.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor for my husband, instead of buying a really expensive one from the art of shaving...and it turns out they have the exact one for way more money! My husband loves it! And you can buy the blades on here or in the art of shaving store. This razor gives you the closest shave!</li>
    <li> I love this razor. It&#x27;s very sturdy, looks and feels like a quality piece. I feel stupid for not switching to a safety razor sooner. This is so much better than throwing my money away on mach &amp;#60;whatever number they&#x27;re up to&amp;#62; blades. I would recommend this to anyone who shaves on a regular basis. With the right blade, these provide a great shave.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very easy to learn with one of these. The sample blade that came with it didn&#x27;t do much for me, but the razor itself is very durable and easy to use, providing a close shave and preventing cutting my skin.</li>
    <li> Exelent quality and it feels good in your hand, a good buy.</li>
    <li> This razor is somewhat heavy, but I kind of prefer it. I also like the longer handle that it sports, over the shorter variations. Again, that&#x27;s just a preference. All in all, it definitely isn&#x27;t a bad razor.</li>
    <li> Nope. I have two Merkur razors and really don&#x27;t like either one. To remove the razor itself, one must unscrew the top. The metal used in making this seems cheap. Bought a used Gillette Slim, and it works so much better.</li>
    <li> High quality. I see no reason why I&#x27;d ever need to replace this handle.</li>
    <li> High quality stuff. Definitely saves money in the long run. Combine this with the 100 platinum razor blades and you&#x27;re good to go for a while!</li>
    <li> Purchased for my husband along with Colonel Conk Classic stand and Parker Badger brush in black/chrome. Fits perfectly on the stand. Also bought the Derby blades. Will update review after a few months of use.</li>
    <li> Must have.  Feels heavy and solid</li>
    <li> I have used a Gillette Mach3 for years.  Last week, went to the store to buy blades:  $21.98 for a pack of 5; last time I bought them I paid $15.29 for a pack of 5.  No more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spent some time searching for alternatives and am convinced by the reviews and discussions I read that the old double-edged safety razor is the way to go.  I bought this razor and 100 Personna blades.  The 100 blades should give me 400 or more shaves (double-edged blade, two shaves per edge, or more) for less than $10.  The Mach3 blades would have given me about 100 shaves for $21.98.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this razor for a week now.  Have not cut or knicked myself once and the shave is SMOOTH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before shaving I wash my face with soap and hot water; rinse; lather up with a shaving brush and shaving soap.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this item 5 July 2012, when I was deployed to Afghanistan. I kept it around until today (27 December 2014), unused, still in the original packaging. Being back home, and wanting to try something new, I decided to give it a shot. During the course of ownership, and non-use, I did extensive research and video watching. Overall, EVERYONE, in EVERY video ALWAYS tells the viewer to &amp;#34;take your time&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;let the weight of the razor do the work.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep it short for my process and overall findings:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Woke Up&lt;br /&gt;Went to get a hair cut&lt;br /&gt;Went to get an oil change&lt;br /&gt;Came home and took a shower&lt;br /&gt;Washed my face with: Kiehl&#x27;s Facial Fuel Energizing Face Wash Gel Cleanser for Men&lt;br /&gt;Dried off, and splashed some warm water on my face&lt;br /&gt;Applied the following shaving cream: Kiehls - Close Shavers Squadron Ultimate Brushless Shave Cream - Blue Eagle&lt;br /&gt;Grabbed my Merkur Long handle and put it to my face. Took a deep breath, and began&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I took my time with my Gillette mach trio blade, however, the most noticeable difference was that I did not feel like I shaved. I shaved, because the sink was filled with my facial hair, but my face didn&#x27;t feel like it was rubbed to death. NO IRRITATION, at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I completed three passes, reapplying my shave cream each time, and when I was done, splashed some cold water on my face, followed by Witch Hazel (purchased locally).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all, even if I change the blade every time I shave, I still will save boat loads of money. I used the blade that came with the razor and it worked fine for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, in all, my advice:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Find a good soap or cream, lather, lather, lather, and take your time. I had ZERO cuts using the Merkur Long Handle, and I attribute it to the style of the razor, paired with me taking my time. I still can&#x27;t believe that my face doesn&#x27;t feel irritated at all, which was a daily feeling after shaving with my Mach Three. Once my current cream is depleted I plan to try the Kiss my Face brand of shaving cream.</li>
    <li> Love this razor. Try it and you&#x27;ll never buy a overpriced 5 blade razor again.</li>
    <li> Great gift for my husband! He loves it!</li>
    <li> I liked it so much, I bought one for my dad. It&#x27;s an excellent option for both men and women.</li>
    <li> Good razor.  I do end up knicking myself a lot, but thats pilot error.</li>
    <li> This Safety Razor has a long handle and easy for guys like me switching from Gillette glide pro to DE Razor. Did my first shave yesterday and started loving it. As mentioned by other reviewers, I took my time and let the weight of the Razor to do the Job. Voila! No cuts and Razor burns. My year long wait was finally over as I ran out of my Gillette 5 blade cartridges that I bought in bulk last year for $100 plus. I am very happy that my shave per cost will reduce to $10/year bearing the initial cost that I invested on this Safety Razor. There is a debate still going in my mind \\&quot;Am I getting old by switching to Old school\\&quot;. Hope the time will convince me that I put the step in right path.</li>
    <li> This razor is awesome. The stainless and steel chromed finish are superb. The quality is a lifelong razor with affordable blades. Money wise a thirty dollar investment. Blades can be found for $10 per 100 blades (Platinum). Pays for itself almost immediately. I like being able to run the razor down my entire cheek, chin/jaw, and neck in one clean stroke. This reduces razor burn as I don&#x27;t have the blade clogging up like conventional disposable multi-blade cartridges and don&#x27;t have to shave over the same spot repeatedly. I have a very coarse beard and this cuts through no problem. Takes a little getting used to but this happens quick. Did I mention the cost savings over conventional razor options?</li>
    <li> razor is great! Hubby just needs to learn how to use it since he has used a safety blade for years..</li>
    <li> Pretty solid, weight is pretty balanced. I now enjoy shaving after switching to this razor.&lt;br /&gt;I am still experimenting with blades and there is a clear difference in some of the kinds... I would recommend buying a sample pack to try a bunch of brands to see what you like most.&lt;br /&gt;The handle length is good and I am glad I didn&#x27;t go with the shorter one, but it would be nice if it was a bit thicker.</li>
    <li> For 30 years I bought into the multi-blade razor hype. I have a very tough beard and over the years as I &amp;#34;upgraded&amp;#34; I added more blades thinking it would be better.  How wrong I was.  I should have followed in my father&#x27;s footsteps.  This razor is incredibly well balanced and although you do have to take longer and put more effort into the shave process, there has never been a razor that left me with such a clean, smooth shave.  It is a combined process with Col. Conk&#x27;s Shave Soap, Personna blades, and a good badger brush that makes it all work.  No more bumps, ingrown hairs, or breakouts.  Never have the multi-blades cut away at my tough beard like this does.  12 hours later and my face feels like it did when I was done shaving with the multi-blade.  I tossed out my multi-blade and am never looking back.</li>
    <li> still doing the job and I am looking good</li>
    <li> I bought this razor BC I was tired of paying almost 30$ for razors every two weeks . I read half of the reviews on here and decided to purchase this razor despite the many people that whine about cutting their selves and the rough shaves they had experienced. It IS NOT A GILLETTE OR MACH 3. Slow down . I shaved the first time with it with no problems and had the closet shave I&#x27;ve ever had . I will not go back to the over priced crap. I shave my head,face and neck about twice a week with no problems, no razor burn cuts or nicks. I purchased this razor and a 100 count of blades for what I spend on Gillettes every month and I&#x27;ve used one razor for four shaves without over using the razor. Well worth the money. I don&#x27;t use lather or shaving cream my best experience is with my wife&#x27;s conditioner.</li>
    <li> Durable. Use all the time. The blades of your choice will determine the quality of the shaving.</li>
    <li> Great shave, and saves money!  What&#x27;s not to like.  Very easy to shave with and not nick yourself.</li>
    <li> Perfect German product</li>
    <li> As solid as it looks, weighted just right and balanced even better.  The handle is actually a little shorter than I expected but has pleased me and now feels like the perfect length.  I would definitely suggest getting the long handled version if you have big, gumpy man-hands like myself.  Easy to clean and easy to switch blades, it&#x27;s a perfect throwback and a reminder of simpler more reliable times.</li>
    <li> On time as usual with Amazon !  Why did I wait so long.  This thing is awesome.  All my fears of transition from the underperforming cartridge razors were dismissed with the first pass with this razor and feather blades. I shave my head and face every other day and wow no comparison to any cartridge razor on the market.  Fit and finish are both top notch.  If you are waiting to buy this out of fear or worried about the learning curve from your current overpriced cartridge razor you are wasting time.  Get this be happy and shave like a man !</li>
    <li> I recently took up shaving with a DE razor (along with the Art of Shaving products) to reduce some of the irritation that I constantly got from my multi-blade razors (I tried them all but none seemed to work).  I read the reviews of this little guy and I figured I would give it a shot. Long story short, this has helped to turn my daily shaving experience around. It took a couple shaves to get totally used to the new razor style, but the learning curve wasn&#x27;t very steep. My only complaint is that the Merkur blade that comes with the razor is pretty average....Get some Feather blades and enjoy the best shave of your life.</li>
    <li> The fit and finish of this razor is first rate.  Provides a great shave, in my book just a touch more aggressive than the average double edge razor.  The chrome has held up just fine for the several years that I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
    <li> This is one nice razor.  I onloy wish I had spent a little extra and got a adjustable one.  I had used a desposable for 38 years. I was sota worried I would cut myself. I am on a blood thinner and that would not be good.  But In have had no problems. Thanks for the quick shipping.  Deal with these folks..They are great.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice razor. Compared to the one I had purchased from Target before, the Merkur razor seems to glide smoother on my skin, which in turn results in less cuts and irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I don&#x27;t have large hands, I purchased this long handled one, which is btw, still shorter than a regular Gillette (17 whatever blades razor).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also bought the SimplyBeautiful stand which matches this razor quite well.&lt;br /&gt;I still need to buy a good, inexpensive brush, and when I do, my setup will be complete.</li>
    <li> This has been my experience.  Yours may vary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tough growth with moderately sensitive skin.  To use this razor effectively, my pre-shave routine is critical.  If you do not soften your whiskers enough, you will not have a good experience with this (or any other) safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Razor has a nice heft to it.  It feels substantial, as opposed to disposables.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cuts are minimum and rare, as long as I hold it at a good angle.  After all my research and hearing about blade angles and such I was pleasantly surprised to find that this razor was quite forgiving in that department.  In other words, I don&#x27;t need to hold this at some &#x27;perfect&#x27; angle.  There&#x27;s a bit of leeway, at least for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have longer hands and the long handle gives me more options as to how I want to hold it.  I  like options.  My hands don&#x27;t feel cramped, so shaving is a more comfortable experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The posts hold the blade snuggly and they are thick enough so that I don&#x27;t have to worry about the blade being off-center.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blade that came with it was also a Merkur, but I wasn&#x27;t impressed with it.  To be fair, my pre-shave  routine wasn&#x27;t as good as it could have been so maybe I didn&#x27;t give it a fair shot.  I went ahead and purchased Gillette razors, which work better for me.  I would suggest doing what I failed to do, buy a sample pack of multiple brands and see what works best for your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with this purchase after using disposables for years and years. Shaving used to be a chore, but now it&#x27;s an experience.  I actually look forward to shaving now.</li>
    <li> Feels good in the hand. Works well with the Astra blades that I bought. Saves a lot of money not having to buy disposables.</li>
    <li> The razor seems to be a good one, but the handle probably needs to be just a little longer. Otherwise, it does the job fine.</li>
    <li> I grew up using cartridge systems and didn&#x27;t really think anything about it.  I turned my husband on to safety razors after reading some articles on them.  I never really considered them practical for leg-shaving, though.  I had gotten accustomed to how quickly, and relatively nick-free, I could shave my legs with a cartridge razor.  After watching my husband successfully navigate a safety razor and really get into the whole process, I decided to order my own.  After looking around, I decided on this brand and model because it seemed to fit the things I would need as a leg shaver.  Despite the fact that I skinned the back of my knee pretty good the 2nd time I used it, I prefer the safety razor over the cartridge.  the older I get, the more I&#x27;m turning into a crunchy hippie.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever stop shaving my legs, but I can&#x27;t stand the monetary and physical waste that cartridge razors encourage.</li>
    <li> Great balance.  Comfortable grip.  The weight is perfect for fluid motion to the face, along the face, and away from the face.  Light enough to maneuver easily, but heavy enough to keep you from whipping it around to quickly, giving the blade enough time to actually cut through the whiskers.&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
    <li> The safety razor works well but replacing the blade requires a total dis-assembly of the razor head. This is more of an inconvenience than anything especially when compared to modern snap on razor heads,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve decided to go back to double edge shaving. I&#x27;ve been using this razor now for just 3 days, and I love it. It&#x27;s a solid, well-made unit. If my face could thank me, it would. You get what you pay for, and this is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> The design is simple and effective, the system is economical and it&#x27;s attractive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read on a blog to use warm water but not too warm or you might burn yourself.  I use cold water because I&#x27;ve always known, somehow, that hot water dulls blades.  Guess what - not too cold or you&#x27;ll freeze the lower have of your face off.  This razor really conducts the temperature of the water.  The razors I&#x27;ve always used have been plastic so I&#x27;ve never experienced this before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This&#x27;s my first experience using classic shaving gear and this razor has been lovely.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love safety razors now that I switched from 5 blade fusions. I have VERY sensitive, acne prone skin so these things really save me from pain and then breakouts. It takes a little longer to shave because you have to basically shave 2-3 times but with that the blade only passes over your face 2 or 3 times whereas with the fusion or other razors, two passes would be 10 blades going over your skin. The single blades are a heck of a lot cheaper than fusion cartridges too.</li>
    <li> Well made and does the job well.  The handle however is not long.  About an inch shorter that a disposable razor.</li>
    <li> Been using for a few years now. I love the simplicity, and the fact that blades are dirt cheap. It&#x27;s built well and I expect it will last for many many years.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed when you unscrew the handle the top doesn&#x27;t open up, instead the top comes completely off. I am satisfied with the razor and how it shavewas disappointed when you unscrew the handle the top doesn&#x27;t open up, instead the top comes completely off. I am satisfied with the razor and how it shaves. It still is easier to clean than those 3 or 4 blade razors.s. It still is easier to clean than those 3 or 4 blade razors.</li>
    <li> Old school shaving is the only way to go. The razor feels like the well built tool that it is. No more grocery store crap for me, shaving has been re-elevated to an art form</li>
    <li> I ended up going to a heavier handle Merkur 34C HD after using this 180 Merkur for a while. This razor did fine but my beard likes a slightly more aggressive design. It is very well made. Gents with lite to moderate beard growth should like this.</li>
    <li> Simple, sturdy and elegant.&lt;br /&gt;I love z German engineering.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m new to shaving with a safety razor and I love it after on a couple of weeks.  I went to it because I was tired of shelling out big bucks to shave.  Even though I did it for money, I like other friends and family have come to love the ritual and manly feel of wet shaving.  I enjoy doing it old school.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for his birthday and it is his BEST shave every.  So smooth and soft!  Love it.  He likes the weight of the razor.  It is a super sharp blade so it took a little getting used to.</li>
    <li> Nice razor but not suitable for me. It&#x27;s easy for hair to become clogged under the blade when the comb is solid like this razor is. Open comb is better for those with corse, thick hair.</li>
    <li> Got this for my dad. He use to have a similar one years ago and at some point either lost it or threw it away. He had bought a new one several years ago out of a catalog and being a cheap version it didn&#x27;t so much as shave as it did &#x27;pluck&#x27; his beard. This one was superior in every way to that cheap one. The Moral? Pay a little more for quality and save your face.</li>
    <li> Takes some practice, but my skin is much better using this rather than a clunky multi-blade cartridge. I even changed to using pre-shave, shaving soap with a shaving brush, and old time like aftershave products.</li>
    <li> I gave this Safety Razor 5-star fors the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s German-made&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s reasonably priced&lt;br /&gt;-It works better than any Gilette I&#x27;ve ever used&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about this Safety Razor:&lt;br /&gt;-This razor, paired with a stand and brush sitting on my bathroom sink, makes me look and feel sophisticated&lt;br /&gt;-The long handle provides extra hand room&lt;br /&gt;-Clean-up/blade exchange is as simple as unscrewing the handle from the head&lt;br /&gt;-The Safety Razor is a 1 time fixed cost and makes shaving cheap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who I would recommend this to:&lt;br /&gt;Any gentlemen who would like to save money while also getting a better shave than they&#x27;ve ever experienced in their life</li>
    <li> Wonderful safety razor and gives me a perfect shave every time. I absolutely love this razor and I will buy another one if it ever breaks or gets lost. It&#x27;s beautiful and the handle gives a super firm grip that is very comfortable. It&#x27;s got a very good weight to it that makes it easier to shave with than lighter razors but it&#x27;s not heavier than the Merkur 38c. I did receive two of these with scratches on them and was a little disappointed but I think it&#x27;s Merkur&#x27;s fault for that. I recommend this razor to anyone looking for the best shave possible!</li>
    <li> This is a great razor due to it&#x27;s long handle length and with the excellent craftsmanship you can expect from Merkur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have owned the 34C short handle model for over a year until I lost, ordered the Long Handle and subsequently found my 34C yesterday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The long handle model pictured above is great, however it differs slightly from the design of the 34C. Both offer excellent shaves with some notable differences;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 34C short handle model is much fatter and heavier. Both have a blade guard, but the Long Handle feels slightly better balanced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also worth noting is the base of the 34C has a round shaft inside the razor that unscrews the head, rather than the entire handle grip unscrewing as is the case with the Long Handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally I like the design of the 34C better for replacing blades, but I like the length and subsequent control the Long Handle gives you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, shave is what you could expect; high quality if you know what you are doing. These razors will never rust or break under normal use. I don&#x27;t recommend dropping however.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a Gillette user since high school.  It&#x27;s what I started with and have stuck with because I don&#x27;t like change. Well I finally learned that I don&#x27;t need a battery powered razor that vibrates 5 blades. 1 good blade is all you need. This razor feels solid in the hand, gives me a close shave (just as close as 5 blades), and is easy to clean. Since I switched from a different kind of razor, it took about 2-3 shaves for me to get completely used to it. This safety razor comes with only 1 blade, so I went ahead and purchased the Personna Double Edge Razor 100 pk for $14 here on Amazon. For me, 100 blades will easily last a year. New 5-blade cartridge cost about $3-4.  New safety razor blade cost $.14 (they are incredibly sharp). I change them out the same rate.  Basically, I have been robbed since high school.  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase and have no reservations about recommending this razor. It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing razor and a true masterpiece in terms of quality and design. I&#x27;ve been using this model for about two years now and it was a real game changer for me. First, I have been saving tremendous amounts of money on razor blades and, second, shaving has become more of a ritual than a chore with this product, when matched with a nice brush and shave soap. The razor looks great, has a nice weight/sturdiness to it and, most importantly, gives me a terrific shave every time! Highly recommend this product. Also, as far as blades go, I would suggest trying out as many types as possible until you get that perfect shave!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving since about 15 years old, I was one of those unlucky kids who had random patches and a scruffy pedostache so I had to shave it all.  11 years later and I still hated shaving.  I constantly walked around with an unkempt and wild beard. This was not at all because I love having a beard, I absolutely hate having a beard. I only had it because the only thing I hated more was shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The part that got me the worst about shaving was the way the razor would SNAG and PULL my whiskers, having extremely sensitive skin, this was nothing short of absolutely unbearable for me. Finally, after a recent razor bump resulting in an ingrown mustache hair, caused people to question my promiscuity, I decided it was time to make a change and stumbled across wet shaving with a DE safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said in the title MY GENERATION WAS ROBBED!  Who&#x27;s bright idea was it to get rid of a brush and lather?  Who thought all these blades pulling and tugging your whiskers was so much better?  IDIOTS!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have hated shaving for ELEVEN YEARS FOR NO REASON OTHER THAN BEING OFFERED NOTHING BUT HORRIBLE RAZORS MY WHOLE LIFE! I don&#x27;t even want to think about how different my life would have played out had I been offered this razor when I first started.  I would have been clean shaven my whole life!!!  Makes me wonder how many job interviews I would not have blown so bad, how many girls would have not politely rejected me.  It&#x27;s crazy how much different people treat me now that I am clean shaved all the time (yes my beard is ridiculous!!!!!!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also personally believe this razor is very newbie friendly.  I have read and watched videos of people using it and they made it sound rather intimidating and complex with the referring to it as an art and all.  I don&#x27;t want to toot my own horn, but I really took to this like a duck in water.  I&#x27;ve had no issues with cuts and have had absolutely no razor burn!!!!!!  I also don&#x27;t have the extremelytight feeling after i shave now, even without aftershave!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now think people who are using electric and disposable shavers are fools!!! If I ever have a son, he will learn to shave with this very razor I purchased here on Amazon!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need to investigate and find out what else my generation missed out on!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> To be totally honest, I ordered this to save money on cartridges, and considering shaving is one of my least favorite things to do; i was not looking forward to using one blade and cutting myself profusely. Instead, i did not cut myself, and received the closest shave i have ever had, let alone seen on modern men. I can grow a full beard, and it looked as if i had shaved less than five minutes ago, throughout the course of the day. My girlfriend loves how smooth my face is, and i cannot believe this way of shaving died off. Either way, I am extremely happy to have discovered it. One of the best shaves ever, for pennies on the dollar. I&#x27;ll take it. If you are on the fence. order it.</li>
    <li> very handy shaving took.</li>
    <li> I wish I had discovered safety razors when I started shaving. I have had this item for about a year now, and I simply love it. I plan to get a smaller version for traveling (although this perfectly fits into my travel shaving kit regardless).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: if you get soap scum buildup on it (which happens regularly), I keep a spare soft toothbrush in the bathroom for the purpose of cleaning my razor. A little bit of tooth paste and some elbow grease, and voila, it&#x27;s back to it&#x27;s beautiful shiny condition again with no scratches on the finish.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving for more than 35 years, typically using the latest 3-, 4- or 5-blade cartridge razor.  I was making a BIG mistake.  This safety razor is the best buy I&#x27;ve made in a very long time.  Not only is this razor efficient and economical, it&#x27;s elegant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about a week, I felt very comfortable using the safety razor, even though it seems intimidating at first.  I checked out a couple YouTube videos on the proper use of the razor, as well as The Art of the Shave and Esquire articles on using a safety razor.  Within a week, I was not only going &amp;#34;with the grain&amp;#34; of my beard, but then re-lathering and going against the grain for a very smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some tips:&lt;br /&gt;--Initial fear of this process is healthy, but quickly overcome.  Start by shaving only with the grain of your beard, and after you do this for three or four days, re-lather and go against the grain.  Going against the grain will give you a shave as smooth--or smoother--than a cartridge razor.&lt;br /&gt;--Add the Proraso Styptic Gel to your shopping cart for those first shaves.  You&#x27;ll have one or two nicks, and the styptic is an effective tool.&lt;br /&gt;--I started using a shaving brush and a shaving soap awhile ago, and still keep that practice with this, although I&#x27;ve found the Proraso pre-shave oil refreshing.  I&#x27;ve become a fan of their entire product line, but mainly because they have a nice, pleasant scent that isn&#x27;t overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;--Don&#x27;t push the razor into your skin.  The Merkur razor is weighty enough that it provides enough pressure to give you a proper shave.&lt;br /&gt;--Purchase one or two of the Sampler blade packs to find a brand you like.  I&#x27;m using a blade for 3 days before changing, but I could probably go a day or two longer.  And honestly, I&#x27;m not finding a difference between most of the blades, but other commenters so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this rate, I&#x27;ll have spent about $25 for the razor and $25 for blades--or about as much as I&#x27;d spend on 6 weeks&#x27; worth of Gillette Fusion cartridges.  So I&#x27;ll save about $125 by not buying cartridges this year along.</li>
    <li> Have only had this for a couple of weeks; seems to be well made. Nice and heavy, feels good in my hand. Gives a good shave. Decided to go back to a double edge razor after years of the multi-blade ones on the market. Got tired of paying for the blade cartridges.</li>
    <li> I had previously invested in the Merkur Futur razor as my transition from disposable to real razors.  While my experience with the Futur was good enough to keep me away from the disposables, it left much to be desired.  A careless turn of the wrist all too often led to a deep gash and I was churning through blades trying to keep as sharp an edge as possible.  Finally I decided to invest in the 180 Long Handled variant.  A better decision could not have been made.  Not only do I almost never cut myself, I can use the same blade many times and can even cut &#x27;against the grain&#x27; without any issue.  I am extremely pleased with the 180 - and in the 30 or so years that I expect this device to last, I&#x27;ll be delighted to purchase a new one.</li>
    <li> I decided to give this product a shot since the Gillette razors seemed to be going up in price and down in quality. The reviews looked promising, and now that I&#x27;ve been using this razor for just over a month, I can tell that I made the right decision. It took me about a week to become effective with this razor, but now I can shave just as fast as I could with my Gillette Mach 1 million (or whatever we&#x27;re up to now). I get a great shave with this razor...even with the generic safety razors I get at the grocery store. The only reason that I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is that that the underside of the razor head is already starting to \\&quot;pit\\&quot;, which was unexpected considering the cost. I will contact the company and see if they will replace it as I have read in other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few tips: 1) The first time you use the razor, make sure you have some extra time to get used to it. I started using it on my weekend so that I could take the time to learn how to use it properly. 2) Don&#x27;t be afraid of it...the same shaving concepts apply...don&#x27;t move it side to side on your face and you&#x27;ll be fine. 3) I found it a little difficult at first to get the \\&quot;hard to get areas\\&quot;, like just under the nose, etc. A little practice and you&#x27;ll be a pro in no time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people recommend the shaving soap, but I&#x27;m doing fine with good &#x27;ol Edge Shaving Gel. Maybe that&#x27;s why the razor is \\&quot;pitting\\&quot; perhaps though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this a great product that will save you money, give you a great shave, and allow you to tell Gillette where to go and how to get there!</li>
    <li> Only used it a couple of times. So far, so good.</li>
    <li> I get a good clean shave using Lord Platinum Blades. Love the long handle. (Every face reacts differently to blades)</li>
    <li> Wonderful razor. Very sturdy, with a decent weight, this razor is very forgiving. I love the handle on it, but will say that I don&#x27;t find it quite aggressive enough (Though I do have very thick coarse facial hair). If you have fine hair, or are new to DE shaving, I suggest you give this razor a try.</li>
    <li> Awesome razor. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> Awesome razor, it should last me a long time.</li>
    <li> great old time razor, heavy and very well made. I use it every day.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with the shave I got.The shave was not as smooth as the one I got with the Gillett fusion flex ball razor.Also the price for this razor is rather expensive and doesn&#x27;t include blades.All in all I should have returned it for a refund but got lazy and didn&#x27;t .</li>
    <li> I use with feather blades, and I love it so much that I will never go back to cartridge razors again!&lt;br /&gt;The blades last forever too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has a nice weight, and it&#x27;s a good transition if you have large hands or you are used to cartridge razors</li>
    <li> Coming from cartridge, I was a bit worried at first about the transition. Turned out it was not much different shaving with this Merkur C23 than with my Gillette Mach 3, but only better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Merkur has a good heft to it, and looks like a fine piece of equipment. It comes with a sample Merkur blade and shaves like a dream. Just imagine using your Gillette Mach 3 but with only 1 blade with an open curve but without a pivotal head, that is how I would describe it. This may sound backward in terms of technology, but the result is more control and less irritation as opposed to the multi-blade systems(which are designed to pull and cut against the skin at a pre-determined angle). I usually need to shave against my hair grain and it is no different with this Merkur, which requires minimal lifting motion on my part, but with much less force than my Mach 3, and I have yet to nick myself with it. Good shaving result if not better than my Mach 3, and definitely smoother skin. I have tossed out my Mach 3 and a full cylinder of unused Mach 3 cartridges because now I think they are junk. Wish I had done this 20 years ago, imagine the aggravation and money I could have saved had I started with DB shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also contemplating on getting the more heavy duty(but with a shorter handle) Merkur C34 which looks equally popular here on Amazon. But for now, I am extremely satisfied with what I have.</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t work with normal size razor blades.</li>
    <li> Memories~~that&#x27;s all !</li>
    <li> This is the second time I buy this razor.  I have tried plenty of others along with the highest rated vintage razors.  For my face - sensitive, this razor is the best blend of closeness and feel.  The longer handle probably feels better because it mimics the long handled plastic razors we grew up using.&lt;br /&gt;For me it works very well with Feather and/or yellow or black 7o&#x27;clock Gillette blades.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended as a first DE razor or an addition to your stable.</li>
    <li> Fantastic Razor, I&#x27;ve gone through every new razor on the market and wasted $$$$, for the price of 5 blades I was able to purchase a fantastic razor that gets the job done. It&#x27;s take a bit to get used to but once to you, you kick yourself for all the years you went without.</li>
    <li> For a while I had a hard time getting a good shave. I found out wet shaving as an alternative and now I will shave this way forever. The cleanest shaves I&#x27;ve ever had.&lt;br /&gt;This is my first safety razor and I&#x27;m very satisfied with it.&lt;br /&gt;Although you have to learn the proper techniques to wet shaving first (go watch on YouTube) and get the rest of the proper equipment, otherwise you&#x27;re wasting money.</li>
    <li> Works great especially for a single edge. We&#x27;ll see if the cost of shaving goes down</li>
    <li> I love this product, There is a learning curve to using these the first time I used the razor It looked like I tried to shave my face off, lots of blood, After a month of use I do not cut myself with it any more, It shaves way closer that my mach 3. My advise is shave right before bed until your face gets use to using it, that way your razor burn will be gone by morning, other than that I love this thing.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the razor, zero complaints. I use it all the time.</li>
    <li> Im a beginner and this shaves my face</li>
    <li> A real razor that&#x27;s safe too! Just right and a great investment.&lt;br /&gt;I had to buy blades, hope they will work</li>
    <li> Excellent quality safety razor. Better than any of the Chinese made versions.  The Derby Extra Double Edge blades in the 100 pack work really well with this.</li>
    <li> Solid razor! I thought it would open up when unscrewed, but the thing comes apart into three pieces to replace blades. OK there, but miss the turn-the-bottom knob to hinge open the top.</li>
    <li> Saving tons of money on not buying razor cartridges. Closest shave I&#x27;ve had using a safety razor.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking it wouldn&#x27;t be as great as a Mach3 with 10-20 blades. I am totally sold on this. It took a bit to figure out the best way to use it, but I love it now.</li>
    <li> Great! A great first safety razer. Very easy to use, closest shave I&#x27;ve gotten in a long time. Make sure to clean it, as shaving cream residue tends to build up a little.</li>
    <li> Have used this for almost 2 years. Awesome purchase</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel very good in the hand, it&#x27;s too light and the metal feels like it&#x27;s chrome painted.</li>
    <li> Nice and smooth,people buy it!!!</li>
    <li> Its a DE razor with a closed comb so you get a less aggressive shave. I found the longer handle to actually inhibit my movement during shaves (hence the 4 stars instead of 5). That said my fiancé stole it from me one day a few months ago for under her arms and I&#x27;ve officially lost possession of it (allowing me to buy another merkur in gold with a shorter handle).</li>
    <li> Not use to it  I keep going back to my Gillette Mach razor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still experimenting and looking for a good blade&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have some on order but don&#x27;t like the blade that it comes with</li>
    <li> If you get razor burn, this razor is for you! My husband is in the Air Force and has to shave everyday, normal razors eat up his skin and he gets terrible razor burn, I bought this for him and he no longer gets razor burn and he LOVES IT! Another added bonus is the money we save on razors! I recommend this for anyone who gets razor burn!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love the razor.  Nice feel in my hands and gives a nice, close shave when paired with the right blades for your face!</li>
    <li> This razor is fantastic.  I&#x27;m new to DE shaving, and after 2 weeks I can safely say that this is my new way of shaving.  I have sensitive skin and a tough, fast growing beard.  After many years of frustration with razor burn all around my neck and my wife being annoyed with my rough face, I decided to try DE shaving.  It&#x27;s been fantastic.  No more razor burn, and shaving is a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for this razor specifically, it has solid construction and holds the blade very well.  The weight is nice and I found it very easy to get the cutting angle right.  Honestly I almost never nic myself with this razor.  Something I can&#x27;t necessarily say for cartridge razors.  I like how it disassembles, which makes it easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The included blade (a Merkur super) was mediocre.  I bought a sampler pack of blades and am currently using an Astra Platinum, which I&#x27;m finding to be much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For other beginners, I didn&#x27;t jump right in with a badger brush and what-not at first.  I found this works great for have a really smooth, irritation free shave - shave oil and sensitive skin Barbasol for my first pass with the grain, rinse my face and neck, reapply shave oil for second pass, no need to reapply for my third pass.  Rinse face, rub down with witch hazel (especially my neck), and finish with aftershave.  Total time is less than 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried doing that whole ritual with a good cartridge razor (including not shaving as &amp;#34;firmly&amp;#34; and better learning the grain of my beard) and it was better than what I was doing previously, but I still got razor burn and irritation.  The DE razor was the final piece that did it for me.</li>
    <li> First safety razor that I have purchased and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I have been using it for nearly 8 months and would never go back to the Gillette Fusions I was using before. Great weight, balanced, and flows easily. Would and have recommended to anyone looking to get a safety razor and get the best shave of your life.</li>
    <li> This was my first safety razor. I bought the long handle model because it&#x27;s similar in size to the modern-style cartridge razors I&#x27;d been used to. The old short handled Gillettes and Schicks I&#x27;d seen on ebay seemed to small. This was (for my face anyway) a really forgiving model to learn on. Not too aggressive of a shave, but still nice and close. I&#x27;ve since branched out to old safety razors I find on ebay and antique stores, but I keep my trusty Merkur on my bathroom counter for use in my rotation. It&#x27;s a product I know I can count on for a nice shave.</li>
    <li> have used this 4 times so far, its been a long time since i was using a single blade, and I have yet to nick myself with it, but I will update this post after I have had this razor for more than a few months. I have found easiest way to replace blade is to unscrew head, set it on countertop, and then remove blade with no hazard to cutting yourself. It is fast and easy. I am happy with this choice, and based on my projected math I will save between 7 cents to 15 cents per day, and no longer dumping all my waste into landfill. I am using another posters idea and collecting my used blades in a metel box that I will recycle when full.</li>
    <li> The second best shave I have ever had.  The absolute best was with a high end, antique straight razor.  I really only shave when I have to due to extremely sensitive skin.  Disposables are not kind to my face.  New big brand razors that use replaceable heads are just as unkind to my face.  You don&#x27;t need 4 tiny blades for a close shave.  In my experience the opposite is true.  The biggest single blade, generally, will give you the closest shave.  It&#x27;s worth noting that I have experimented with several brands of shaving soap with this razor.  Results will vary based on your skin, but a decent artisanal soap worked best for me.  It&#x27;s very easy to change blades when the time comes.  Just make sure you&#x27;re not in a hurry or you will cut your finger(s) or hand.  Also, these razors last.  I&#x27;ve had mine for about 3 years now and it looks as new as the day I opened the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I did not purchase this through Amazon.com.  I purchased mine through my local Tobacconist, who keeps a small and limited selection of gentleman&#x27;s grooming supplies.</li>
    <li> I really was not impressed with this razor.  I didn&#x27;t find the quality of the shave to be any better or worse than the Gillette products I normally use.  I actually returned this item to Amazon.</li>
    <li> I was disposable razors for awhile before switching to a Parker cartridge straight razor. Both were giving me razor burns. Then I switched to the Merkur Model 180 using Derby blades, and this has been the best shave of my life. Although some say there is a small learning curve, I found it was very easy to use. I might be because I switched to it from a straight razor, which had a much greater learning curve. Anyways, I had this razor for a few months now, and no problems at all.</li>
    <li> This is the first Safety Razor that I purchased, and I&#x27;m relatively pleased with the razor. I originally bought it based on a recommendation from The Art of Manliness website regarding wet shaving.  Although I do state that the razor is a great first razor, I found it to be quite mild, and decided to change to a more aggressive razor within just a month or two.  This would be a great razor for the type of man who&#x27;s looking to shave on a daily basis without the baby-butt-smooth shave, or for the guy who&#x27;s not sure whether or not they want to transition to a double-edged safety razor from the multi-bladed razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another word of advice for the would-be safety razor shaver:  check out YouTube for shaving videos from Geofatboy and Mantic59. These two aficionados make shaving a true art, with tutorials and reviews.  I&#x27;ve personally purchased the majority of the products I use personally based off their reviews.</li>
    <li> great razor - easy to get used to and fun to use. My skin feels better - no redness and bumps like i used to get with mach 3 .</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas and he loves it! Read some reviews that this is a great choice for transitioning from disposable razors and he&#x27;s really enjoying it!</li>
    <li> This is a fairly mild razor that is the perfect pick for early morning shaves.  It doesn&#x27;t demand your full attention, and is somewhat forgiving when it comes to lapses in technique.  That alone makes it amazing, but when you factor in the sub $30 price tag for a Merkur, it makes this an item that can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
    <li> i was using the gilette fusion (like every one else) and it worked good, but i only got about 3 shaves before it started going dull. and boy are those replacements expensive. i read about the merkur&#x27;s awhile back and kept them in mind, but didn&#x27;t really want to drop $30+ on a razor that possibly wouldnt do much difference. well, now that ive switched over to merkur, i only have to shave every 3 days and the razors last a long time, and you get 10 blades for $4!!! i havent bought any crappy gilette or overly priced blades in months! i love the switch and you dont need \\&quot;skill\\&quot; to shave your legs with this bad boy. love this product and glad i made the switch! my boy-f is also making the switch.</li>
    <li> The razor blade that came with it works great</li>
    <li> As a 61 year old male I have been shaving a long time, this is my first razor from Germany and at this price range.  I started out on DE razor and have made full circle back to a DE razor.  I&#x27;ve shaved with every type of razor, but this Merkur is the best shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten. I have several vintage Gillette&#x27;s that I have been using but I really wanted to keep those to pass on to my grandsons so I decided to buy a new razor to do my daily shaving. After doing my research and all the good reviews of the 180/23c I decided to give the 180 a try, and boy was I surprised at the ease and quality of my shave with this fine razor. The long handle is one of the feathers I like best, it seems the way I hold the razor with the extended handle the weight of the razor just glides through my beard. I would highly recommend this razor to anyone who is looking on buying a new razor.</li>
    <li> Basically I bought this for the novelty of getting back to the \\&quot;basics\\&quot; and simplfiying things. This razor has the most positive reviews and is the best selling razor on amazon. I liked the fact that it has an old school design and is what most men have been using for generations, until the disposable razors came out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not much of a noticable difference in actual shave length then what I&#x27;m used to. I was a little aprehensive about the learning curve, but rest assured, there was none. Just shave like normal. No cuts or anything first time. The actual shaving part took about the same ammount of time. I usually get a few razor bumps on my neck area, and I can say they were substantially less from using this razor. I used the Merkur razor blade that came with it. I like how it&#x27;s \\&quot;fun\\&quot; to use. Makes you feel like you&#x27;re \\&quot;classy.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor itself:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great quality, stainless steel, three piece apparattus. No wobble to it. Hasn&#x27;t unscrewed itself once while shaving. Here&#x27;s a note to travelers; if you forget to take the blade out before going through security, you can just unscrew it and toss it, and they won&#x27;t make you throw the entire thing out. I noticed a lot of stores actually still sell the safety razors, even though they don&#x27;t sell the handle/shaver.&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: The ad decription says \\&quot;long handle,\\&quot; and I don&#x27;t have giant hands, the handle is about 5 inches. I don&#x27;t think that is \\&quot;long,\\&quot; or any different than any other standard razor. But it is comfortable anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, if you want a quality razor that may or may not give you a better shave, but would like to experience a smoother feeling, more \\&quot;manly\\&quot; type of shave, this razor is worth the $32. Makes you feel good using it. Adds a touch of \\&quot;I am MAN\\&quot; to any pink flowery bathroom. Makes shaving about as \\&quot;fun\\&quot; as it can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I actually look forward to shaving every day. Good purchase.</li>
    <li> This is my second DE razor; My other one is an Edwin Jagger de89.  The merkur is lighter, the handle is longer, and is thinner.  I feel like as a first DE shaver it would be great b.c it is very similar to the feel of a Mach 3 in terms of handle length and the way you would shave.  With the de89, I let the blade do all of the work....it is top heavy and I do not have to add any pressure myself.  When using the merkur w/ feather&#x27;s I had to bear down a little harder than I would like and It caused me to have a slight razor burn.  IMO, a heavier shorter DE razor works best b.c it does the work for you.  The merkur is great, but the shave is not as smooth as I would like.</li>
    <li> It works really well. It&#x27;s my first safety razor, so I was cautious when I started using it. It&#x27;s incredibly smooth and feels quite well-balanced in my hand. As a novice I wasn&#x27;t quite sure how to open it up at first and the directions on the box are minimal at best. Fortunately there are plenty of online resources. So far so good!</li>
    <li> Gentlemen, if you haven&#x27;t started shaving the proper way, please take a moment and consider it. Wet Shaving makes you feel like a million bucks and Merkur Long Handled Razor is one of the best. For men with bigger hands, the long handle helps. Unfortunately, it does feel a little slim compared to the shorter handles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However this product works great and will continue to work great for years to come. It may seem a little much for a razor up front, but once you buys this product, you will no longer need to buy expensive razors. My razors are about 0.25 each and I get a good 5-6 shaves out of each one. Over time, you&#x27;ll realize you save tons of money on this style of shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus ladies love that you smell good and its really an onramp to better overall grooming habits. If you take the time to shave with a safety razor, chances are you&#x27;ll take time to make sure you look good before heading out the door.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t add much to the already large number of high quality reviews. It&#x27;s a great safety razor; good heft and design aesthetics; the ingrained pattern grip helps keep from dropping it.  Highly recommended</li>
    <li> I assume that anyone looking at this is contemplating moving from &amp;#34;modern&amp;#34; razors to the &amp;#34;old style&amp;#34; razor. While I HATE the ridiculous prices the razor companies charge for the plastic throw-away 3-4-5 blade cartridges and the fact that there is so much waste in using them, I am not totally sold on the performance of the single-blade safety razor over that method. I have found that I do not get a very good shave at all the first pass and have to re-lather and make upwards of 4 passes over my face before I have a stubble-free shave. This causes cuts and irritation I do not get with my Sensor cartridge razor. I am using the Merkur blade that came with the shaver, and have ordered some Feather blades that are supposed to be better, so that may change. In addition, the head of this razor is so large that it is hard to get in tight places like under my nose. While the handle is &amp;#34;long&amp;#34; it is still only 3.75 inches long while the handle on my Sensor is a full 5 inches. This one is just a little too short for me to feel comfortable dragging so much heavy steel with a razor attached across my face. All it takes is one slip of the handle and the heavy head will go its own way and make a mess of your face. I would definitely get the longest handle I could. I also would get the butterfly-open style because it is a pain to unscrew the handle from the head, take the two head pieces apart and wash the gunk off the blade when you are done. It would be much easier, and safer, to be able to crank open the doors, lift the blade out by the dull sides, wash it and drop it back into the top of the head. All in all, I question both the method and this particular device in meeting my shaving needs.</li>
    <li> Takes a while to get used to.</li>
    <li> I bought this as my first safety razor and it&#x27;s been amazing. Shaving is an art form and a leisure activity now. I feel like I&#x27;m pampering myself. The blades are really easy to get out and stay in straight sturdy and strong. Good heft to the handle.</li>
    <li> My husband was really excited about this razor. I got him this and some replacement blades. He got the worst razor burn he&#x27;s ever had, it took days to heal. He has only used it twice and switched back to his Gillette. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t intend to go into great detail and write a 200 word review.&lt;br /&gt;Simply said: This razor is superb!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am old enough to remember my father and grandfather using safety razors in the &#x27;70&#x27;s. My father only stopped because it can appear time consuming versus the disposable standard razors popular today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My shaving is now cleaner, closer and smoother.&lt;br /&gt;I have not cut myself since I realize I am using a &amp;#34;razor&amp;#34; sharp blade without a plastic guard.&lt;br /&gt;I am not experiencing the razor bumps of the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the Merkur razor to anyone looking for cleaner, closer and smoother shaving.</li>
    <li> This thing is built for the long haul to say the least. It is hefty, perhaps to hefty. I have rather large hands and I am extra careful when using it due to its weight and maneuverability. Actually it is to heavy for my needs. It gives and OK shave but you may find it takes 2 to 3 strokes to get a smooth shave. Also inserting the blade requires you to twist the shaving head off, separate the razor head and twist it back on increasing your chances of an accidental slice or two. I am opting for a lighter version with a butterfly opening head so I only have to touch the edges of the razor blade when changing them in and out.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor on recommendation from a friend. I was tired of spending money on the 5 blade shavers. I have to say the shaves are as good with this razor and the experience is better.</li>
    <li> I really like this item.  It is long enough to grip, easy to clean and change blades.  Looks good, too.</li>
    <li> For me this is cost effective, and of course... Awesome. I read the reviews and knew I should try one.&lt;br /&gt;I will not go back to the expensive disposable twenty razors on one shaver for a close shave crap.&lt;br /&gt;This gives a much better shave, will feel quality in your hand. Very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> My Father shaved with this type of razor for years. Now I am continuing the legacy. The trick is buying this fine shaver,and second the razor blade you pick. I picked the ASTRA Superior Platinum. Best darn shave ever. You don&#x27;t need 5 blades,and the cost savings Vs. the disposable  is $ measurable. You do need to be careful and finding your shaving technique is essential. The tenique will come with the practice....or you will slice,cut and nick yourself silly. Enjoy !</li>
    <li> I bought this razor for my husband as a Christmas present and he loves it! It&#x27;s a good size and has a nice weight to it. He uses the Feather blades with it (which are really sharp), and the combination of this razor with those blades are great for his thick facial hair.</li>
    <li> Unlike the others, I really did get the correct product as advertised.  It does not corrode and it has not fallen to pieces like some of the reviewer&#x27;s unlucky orders.  It is easy to unscrew to pop in and out razor blades.  Cleaning and drying is simple with this.  The length and weight of it feels fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came from a Mach 3 razor to switching to this safety razor and I will never go back!  Buying packs of razors are much cheaper and more environmentally friendly.  For newbie shavers using this safety razor, I would say that there is nothing to worry about in terms of hurting yourself.  I thought that this thing would be ultra sharp and that I would bleed to death because it&#x27;s a new razor, but so far I have yet to cut or nick myself shaving.  In fact, I shave just like I did with my Mach 3 razor, but with less pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this safety razor by Merkur.  As for the brand of razors to use, I really cannot suggest any to use with this safety razor. I bought a sample pack of 100 razors and switch off to a new brand weekly.  I cannot tell the difference between any of them.  100-pack sample &#x3D; ~$25 for 2 years worth vs Mach 3 razor cartridges &#x3D; $25 every couple of months.</li>
    <li> I tried. I went through just about everything to make this product work. I went to Badger&amp;beaver.com to get some tips from experienced shavers, I watched videos on how to shave and make a great lather. I&#x27;ve tried different razors. I&#x27;ve tried different soaps and creams. I&#x27;ve spent around $150 on different products, trying different things and I still end up with a very irritated face full of nicks and cuts. I was told it takes practice. I&#x27;ve been practicing for a month (shaving every 3 days) and still no luck. I never got irritated skin with other 3-5 blade razors. Maybe DE razors are just not for me. Overall, I had a better shaving experience with regular 3-5 blade razors (with smoother skin). The only thing I&#x27;ll take from this experience is how to make a great lather out of shaving soap. I&#x27;ll continue to use it because it&#x27;s great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not saying no one should buy this (other people are obviously getting a great shave from this product), I&#x27;m telling my experiences.</li>
    <li> I have spent so much money on razors over the past 20 years. I have a very sensitive face and have always had issues with shaving. This item, along with the Feather razors is outstanding. I should have been using one of these from the get go!</li>
    <li> I have nothing to compare this razor to except the Mach3 that has sat in my medicine cabinet for the last 8 years.  Tired of the irritation, ingrown hairs, painful shaving and ever-increasing cost of multi-blade cartridges, I decided to make a change. After a week researching B&amp;B and Amazon, I purchased this razor, a Parker badger brush, some ToOBS cream, 100 Astra SP razors, and an alum block.  I&#x27;ve been using these products in concert everyday for a week, and my face has never looked or felt better.  Other than my first time shaving, where I put pressure on the razor, I&#x27;ve never had an issue with razor bumps or irritation.  While the ingrown hairs around my neck have not totally disappeared they have decreased in number, and are not nearly as irritated post shave as they were post shave with my Mach3. Plus, it never, and I mean never, hurts to shave.  No tugging, no pulling, and no cuts.  The Merkur now occupies the old Mach3 spot, and the Mach3 has been retired to the trash.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used electric razors for most of my adult life, and only recently got introduced to the world of DE shaving.&lt;br /&gt;After doing some online research about safety razors, I decided to give Merkur Model 180 a try. Thanks to other&lt;br /&gt;reviewers, I had some idea of what to expect. I have to say that it wasn&#x27;t until a few weeks of use, that I started to get comfortable with this razor, understanding the finer nuances like the angles of the blade, and the pressure applied for different parts of the face. I, finally, had a shave that was close and without nicks and cuts, and irritation. For me, this is a fine peace of shaving equipment, that won&#x27;t break the bank!</li>
    <li> UPDATE 9/4/12&lt;br /&gt;After 4 or 5 shaves either the blade was broken in somehow or my technique was better. I now rarely cut myself.  So I feel much better about this razor and I upgraded it from 3 stars to 4.  I still get a very good shave but it takes longer than the cassette multiblade razors. The key now is how long it will last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review 8/27/12:&lt;br /&gt;I have had the Merkel razor for about 2 weeks now. I bought it because the price for Gillette multi-blade replacement blades is so high.  Blades for the Merkel razor are about 1/4 the cost.  But there are downsides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Merkel razor came with 1 Merkel sample blade.  This seemed to drag leaving many blood spots and a burned feeling that lasted into the next day.  I had also bought feather blades.  After 3 tries with the Merkel blade I switched to a Feather. The Feather blade was much better, still a few blood spots but fewer and much less burned feeling. I am becoming adept again with the styptic pencil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As noted by others this razor requires more time - maybe double the time per shave to get all whiskers and not cut my throat completely and to apply the styptic pencil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost savings will depend on how long the blade lasts.  We shall see about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suspect that after I use all the feather blades I bought (10) I will go back to to paying off Gillette or their competitor.  Shaving time, comfort and dealing with blood spots may not be worth it.  I will try to update this later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides cost other advantages are; a very close shave and easy to clean.  Blade clogs are rare and quick and simple to clean out.</li>
    <li> I used Gillette Sensor 3 razors for several years, but finally got tired of the cost versus moderate quality of shave. Thus started my quest for a reasonably priced alternative. When I first stumbled upon the classic safety razor renaissance I was skeptical to say the least. I mean, don&#x27;t products get better over time? Why would an old school system be better than the modern multi-blade alternatives? Isn&#x27;t this the same thing my dad used back in the 50s? But after reading the positive reviews for the Merkur 180 I decided to give it a shot. All I can say is \\&quot;Wow!\\&quot;. Extremely impressed. I get a close shave, and it&#x27;s a pleasure to use. I just finished dialing in my beginner kit, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. It consists of the following.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor&lt;br /&gt;- Merkur Double Edge Razor Blades (liked them much better than Feather brand)&lt;br /&gt;- Anthony Logistics for Men Shave Cream, 6 Ounce (tried Proraso, but found this less heavy/greasy)&lt;br /&gt;- Tweezerman Men&#x27;s Shaving Brush&lt;br /&gt;- Colonel Ichabod Conk Chrome Safety Razor Stand&lt;br /&gt;- Edwin Jagger White Porcelain Shaving Bowl with Handle* (white; not on Amazon so I bought from another source)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The Edwin Jagger shaving bowl was expensive, but after trying a variety of little bowls, coffee mugs, measuring cups, and other things from my kitchen, I decided to break down and buy it. It has made all the difference. It&#x27;s designed specifically and perfectly for the task. Love it.</li>
    <li> This is my first double edge safety razor. I used to use disposable 2 blade razors and they didn&#x27;t last more than a few shaves before they got dull. The Merkur is a razor that was designed for shaving. The blades don&#x27;t wear out as fast or get clogged. This razor provides a close shave with no irritation or razor burn. I will never use a disposable razor again.</li>
    <li> My shaving quest is at an end. Here is the criteria I&#x27;ve been shooting for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) I use only water and a razor&lt;br /&gt;2) It must be quick, I can&#x27;t be bothered cleaning it out every single stroke&lt;br /&gt;3) On the subject of quick, I would prefer something safer than a bare blade&lt;br /&gt;4) I prefer simple maintenance, and while I would like a straight to work&lt;br /&gt;  for me they require more mainenance and care of use than I like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found in my very first shave that this is the product I&#x27;ve been looking for. I went for the whole shebaaz right up front. I shaved my face first. Completely smooth in a full 3 passes, which went by very quick, I even did the first without water (aside from rinsing out the razor) just to test the irritation factor. I got no tugging and it was easy to find the angle of use. Then I wet my whole head and shaved that down. Very smooth, very fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did all that with just water aside from where I didn&#x27;t even use that. I also used the blade that came with the razor. I got zero cuts, but I have two straights and I was aware not to press into my skin like a mach 3 or sensor requires to get a close cut. My skin gets little irritation from any razor but I didn&#x27;t get more than a light burn anywhere on my face, mostly around my mouth where I made quite a few extra passes since I was carrying about a week old beard. I suspect with any kind of cream or shaving soap I wouldn&#x27;t feel anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor itself has a nice feel and grip to it. The handle is not what I would call long so if you are big handed I would suggest not getting a standard length handle (my hands are small). Adding a blade is extremely easy. Cleaning is also extremely easy, a pass under the faucet or perhaps in a bowl is all it takes to disgorge any hair in the unit. The chrome is a little TOO chrome for me. I&#x27;m always leery of \\&quot;high chrome\\&quot; products so time will tell on this aspect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are tired of spending a fortune on cartridges thisis your razor. An excellent point to start into shaving properly. The straight razor may hold allure, but using it on a daily basis is a true hassle if you are busy. This little gem offers speed and a clean shave with blades that are a cheap and don&#x27;t require sharpening. Do get yourself a straight, also, to shave around the mouth and nose area, and possibly up close on the ears if you wish to be very thorough and exceptionally clean cut. I can&#x27;t tell you about creams/soaps/aftershaves/oils/etc since I don&#x27;t use any of them but I may be able to dabble about now in that area since I&#x27;m not going to need to spend on cartridges and other razors I won&#x27;t use for more than a short while.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving with this safety razor for a couple months now after ordering it here on Amazon. I have to say it&#x27;s really the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had. I find it simpler to clean while shaving (as opposed to disposable razors), just as fast if not faster than disposables, easy to avoid cuts, great at reducing ingrown hairs and irritation, and best of all a shave like none other. Obviously the blade is quite sharp and should be handled with care. Nothing that can cut the hair of a beard will simultaneously be safe as a child&#x27;s toy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been looking into different shaving techniques and had initially been interested in the straight razor, but upon further reading of the upkeep of such a blade I turned towards the safety razors. With  only four parts (including the blade) the changing of blades is very simple and this also allows for the cleaning of all the pieces in depth if you feel things are getting any buildup (though I&#x27;ve had none).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle and razor housing look just as pictured and adds a touch of class to the whole event of shaving. In fact it really makes shaving something that feels like more of a luxury to enjoy than a chore to speed through. Is this because the experience and result is better? Maybe. Is it the fact that a little weight on the handle adds a little weight to the feeling? Maybe. Or is it that it feels kind of cool using a blade like a real man who might otherwise smoke cigars, drink scotch, and play a mean game of poker? It probably all plays it&#x27;s part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All things said I shave more regularly now as a result of getting a higher quality product than disposable. My girlfriend has certainly been loving it too. If you&#x27;re somewhat interested in this kind of shave then this really is the way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great price.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.&lt;br /&gt;Great shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something everyone should have.</li>
    <li> Very good razor - I&#x27;m a first-time 1950&#x27;s style shaving razor user, and very impressed.  Took me one time to get used to it.  Nothing to it.  Blade actually \\&quot;curves\\&quot; when you install it, and you shave at a 30* angle.  Went from using Mach 3 to this.  //Jason</li>
    <li> Compared to my old Mach 3, this is easily a five star product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- However, compared to other safety razors, it lacks an adjustable angle. This wasn&#x27;t a problem for me just starting out, but I&#x27;m now considering branching out into more adaptable razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- It delivers on the longer handle, though it turns out I grip it pretty close to the blade anyway.&lt;br /&gt;- I&#x27;ve had mine for 2 years without the breaks described in other reviews. *fingers crossed*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s been a transformative shaving experience. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone looking to switch to safety razors that has large hands.</li>
    <li> This is the first time i used a double edge razor and i cut myself a few times. Also i was shaving my head and eventually found the right angle and then everything went smooth just like my head after i was done.</li>
    <li> Good if you shave everyday.  If you let it grow for a few days like me, stick to the multi blades.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t mastered how to shave timely but it does offer a very smooth shave.  Hopefully this will keep me from spending tons on Gillette razors.</li>
    <li> I like it, just like the old days when I used one as a teen. Just don&#x27;t press too hard or go over the same area more than</li>
    <li> Upon opening the package and retrieving the Razor from its original box, I could not the believe the beauty of this razor... the craftsmanship was so impeccable that I said to myself; &amp;#34;I can&#x27;t use this to shave with&amp;#34;..... This had to be displayed somewhere and never used....LOL.  However, I could not wait to use it!  I loved the construction of the razor (being a 3 part razor) as opposed to the butterfly openings which I&#x27;ve been using, the color is very nice, the weight is lighter than my Parker 22r &amp; a generic one that I own (it&#x27;s neither too heavy or too light) &amp; it bears the Merkur name which is engraved in the bottom portion of the handle.  I&#x27;m not quite sure what constitutes long handled safety razors as the 3 that I own are all long handles and are different when comparing their sizes.  I just prefer the long handled razors as it gives me more support when shaving.  Although butterfly open safety razors are simpler to operate by just opening the head and dropping the razor in, the 3 part Merkur opens by unscrewing the handle, disassembling the 2 parts of the head, drop the razor in and reattach the handle.... takes a few minutes longer, but nothing excessive and you&#x27;re in business.  I did just that on my first shave with my new razor; dropped a Feather blade in, used some pre-shave oil that I made at home (Youtube tutorial: Castor oil, Jojoba oil, Grapeseed oil and Extra Virgin Olive oil....good stuff) &amp; some Proraso shaving soap.  And what an experience I had.  I&#x27;ve read a lot of reviews where people say that shaving with DE Safety Razors is all hype, but I beg to differ.  I changed over from the 4 and 5 blade disposable razors due to the high cost of those razors.  Once you perfect the art of shaving with a safety razor, the experience can be very refreshing.  I don&#x27;t mind taking the extra time to get that very close, clean cut shave (both head and face) that I need; I spent 27 years in the Army and I&#x27;m in currently in Law Enforcement, so I have to shave everyday, so therefore shaving is a MUST for me.... I&#x27;ve taken the time to learn how to use the safety razor, enjoy doing it and protecting my skin in the process, mind you it came with some challenges early on....LMBO!!!  So try this razor for sure, make sure to use the proper shaving materials that suit your face and / or head and never look back.  I just hope that my Merkur stands up to the beauty and productivity that it posses now (I&#x27;ve read where some others have had construction issues).  Btw, I prefer Feather blades and Gillette 7 O&#x27;clock blades which give me the cleanest / closest shaves without any skin issues; but again, you have to see what suits your skin and needs.

    <li> He enjoys this so much more than regular razors. He has sensitive skin, and this razor is very gentle--will buy refill blades!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m the kind of guy that&#x27;s had razor burn on his neck since he was 16 years old. Not because of my technique, but because I couldn&#x27;t afford a new pack of Gillette Mach 3 razors every week. I tried stropping the blades for longer use on the Mach 3 heads, but basically I could only get one good shave out of each head without getting irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started to read about how to get longer life out of mach 3 blades when I came across safety razors... did a little research and found that this Merkur was a solid brand, so I thought I would give it a try and I am extremely happy to say that after a week of using a new blade with every shave, I have no redness, no irritation, no razor burn! Each guy likes a different brand of straight razors, but I&#x27;ve only tried the Derby blades and I am happy with them... and at 8 cents a blade, I have no issue with using a brand new blade with each shave.... I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor to replace a &amp;#34;butterfly&amp;#34; razor that broke and it is an excellent razor, for me.  The &amp;#34;butterfly&amp;#34; would not stay tightly closed and left me with a lot of nicks as a result.  This razor close tightly and stays that way!  That insures that the blade is held at the proper angle in the razor while shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a little heavy but I am a fairly big guy.  The textured handle makes it easy to maintain a proper grip which also helps reduce nicks.  I use it for both facial shaving and manscaping and it performs very well in both applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good razor seems to be a combination of three things, to me.  A proper angle of the blade is key to a close shave.  The angle combines with proper blade exposure, too much and you get cut, too little and a close shave is hard to achieve.  That blade exposure and angle need to be maintained by the razor locking properly.  This Merkur does all three for me.</li>
    <li> Did good job gave a close shave on a very tuff beard and lasted for several shaves out performed electric razor</li>
    <li> As described but the handle is too thin to use accurately, My previous Merkur gave a much better and closer shave.  The lightweight design of this one left a lot to be desired.  The blade does not sit well in the buckle as there are no tabs inside.  This the blade can become misaligned with going through course hair.  I still think this is a better razor than any disposable on the market however, I recommend spending the extra $10-$30 and getting the better quality.</li>
    <li> This is the best DE razor on the market; unlike the slightly more convenient one piece butterfly style, the three piece Mekur bends the blade ever so slightly to give a flatter blade to skin shave angle shaveshave a closer but more comfortable shave. This DE shaver is the next best thing to a straight razer, at a fraction of the cost, effort, and blood of a straight razor. Like the straight razor, the DE  takes time and patience to learn and use, but can become part of a warm and fragrant morning wakeup ritual that beats the electric and triple head cartridge shavesin cost, quality, and experience of the shave.</li>
    <li> Solid and easy to shave with, easy to clean, and easy to replace the blades, and cheap! all you need is one blade, multiple blades is a SCAM and a waste! for instance, does a sword need 3 blades to cut someone in half? no because its a F%$#*@$ sword!</li>
    <li> This is the first razor I bought, works great and is easy to use!  After using it for a year I decided I would like something with a little more weight to it but I expect to have this razor for the next 50 years as well.</li>
    <li> After reading a lot of the reviews on this razor I decided to make the purchase.  When it arrived I was very pleased with the quality of the product.  It was easy to assemble &amp; felt comfortable in my hand.  However it just isn&#x27;t aggressive enough for my beard, which is pretty tough.  I am returning it today, not because the product isn&#x27;t quality, but because my beard is like a forest of ironwood trees.</li>
    <li> why wasnt i using this from the beginning.  i get serious razor bumps &amp; figured newer was better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;black men, this is the razor u need (along with pre &amp; after shave creams/lotions/oils/scrubs)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars bcause i cant seem to NOT nick my adams apple each time...</li>
    <li> I was in love with this razor until I noticed the head sitting at an off Angle. Seems someone in my family must have dropped it, and the head is breaking off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So great... so long as you don&#x27;t drop it.</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t shave with anything else. I started out with a merkur travel, handle want long enough. This gets the job solidly done.</li>
    <li> Very comfortable on face and in hand. Does the job better than Gillette, Schick or any cartridge razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Comfort, Maintenance Price, Learning Curve, Ease of Use, Less Ingrown Hairs, Less Razor Burn&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advisories: High Initial Investment Price (low maintenance costs save your wallet in the long run), Duration of Shave (doesn&#x27;t affect me because of the high satisfaction in shave but some people may not like an additional 2-5 minutes spent in front of the sink)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No Cons!</li>
    <li> This would be 5 Star Rating on purchase had it come with a pack of five to ten razor blades.</li>
    <li> I am a woman, and I have been using this razor and Merkur Double Edge Razor Blades for about 7 months now. I have used it for my underarms and my legs and I can honestly say that I haven&#x27;t had an ingrown hair or razor burn the entire time I have been using it.&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it I expected to cut myself up like crazy, as that was what all the reviewers where saying had happened to them. I was almost disappointed when I got through the whole ordeal with only one or two nicks. ;) But I suppose that is due to the fact I read A LOT about this and other safety razors before I started shaving with it and knew how to wield it. A bit of advice to you ladies: just use this like you would a normal razor, only don&#x27;t push down hard when you are shaving, or you will cut yourself.&lt;br /&gt;I am completely sold on this razor. It has not started rusting yet in all the 7 months I have used it and kept it in the shower caddy. I store it upright, with the blade at the top, so that the water easily drains away from the blade, which will rust a tad bit if you keep the blade in the razor for more than 30 days.&lt;br /&gt;I change my razor blade whenever I feel that I am not getting as close a shave as I was when I first put the blade in. This is anywhere from 18 to 30 days. It really depends on how large an area you are shaving, how close a shave you want, and how coarse your hair is.&lt;br /&gt;I went from a plastic, 5 blade razor with a moister strip to this safety razor when I started reading about the harmful effects of the chemicals and plastics that are in normal razors. I have never looked back and am so very happy with my choice. I am saving money, time (I don&#x27;t have to go to the store every 2 months and try to decided which pack of razors to get), and the planet (we all know how bad plastic can be for the environment)! This razor has made me a very happy woman.</li>
    <li> The grip on this razor is much less grippy than the handles on the short handled Merkur razors. I was disappointed by this, though it is still completely usable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other unfortunate design decision is that instead of having the threading extend to the bottom of the handle, this razor unscrews right near the blade. Though not a deal breaker, I prefer the ease of blade change facilitated by the longer threading on the short handled razor from Merkur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, this razor gets used almost daily as my wife&#x27;s main razor. It&#x27;s a far better way to shave legs and armpits than the junk disposables with so many blades.</li>
    <li> nice length. nice weight. don&#x27;t like like to disassemble the whole head to flip or change the blade.&lt;br /&gt;that&#x27;s not hot the bad part. the handle gets very, very slippery and can a be a bit dangerous. good&lt;br /&gt;quality, but way to slippery when whet to handle properly.</li>
    <li> Love it, best razor I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best investment i made i cant even tell you how much I love it BRAVO</li>
    <li> Works great, haven&#x27;t cut myself on it yet after many months of use, much less expensive than disposable razors.  Feels very solid and durable, comes apart for easy cleaning...  a great purchase.</li>
    <li> Love it. Much better than the Van der Hagen I bought at Target that never shaved anywhere near as close as this Merkur, nor did it close properly after only a month of use.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll never do cartridge blades again. Hoping this razor will last me a long time. I&#x27;ll update this review if things change but for now I&#x27;m convinced this was the right choice for me. Sturdy build. Good quality. No flaws in the chrome worth mentioning, it is much smoother finish than the picture shows which in some places had me worried before I&#x27;d received it. It holds blades perfectly straight and the &amp;#34;aggressiveness&amp;#34; seems to be light/medium. Perhaps a bit more toward medium though.</li>
    <li> Perfect shaver.  Good size handle, good weight to the razor, and already saving me hundreds of dollars in razor blades.  Go old school, and dump the 10 blade razors that cost a month&#x27;s salary.</li>
    <li> Will never go back to disposables!  Get the Personna Double Edge Razor Blades, 100 Count and some Sandalwood shaving cream and brush you enjoy shaving.  The blades last a week or so - I problably change them more than needed.  The Sandalwood shaving cream smells great and gives a great shave with the razor.</li>
    <li> It actually has a little weight to it, used it yesterday for the first time along with the taylor bond street sandalwood shaving cream and even bought the escali razor/brush stand. I recommend the Personna Double Edge Razor Blades with this, beautiful shave.</li>
    <li> Been using this for about a year now, and I am a fan.  The razor is great quality, with a good weight, and nice long handle.  Haven&#x27;t had any problems with it at all, and I would recomend it to anyone who is moving from an electric or disposable to a safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have the typical red head problem with shaving (sensitive skin but tough beard hair) and going to a safety razor has made the shaving process much less painful.  It does take much longer now, but I don&#x27;t dread the process as much.</li>
    <li> LOVE!!!  For the women out there looking for affordable eco-friendly options, this was a delightfully easy transition. I was nervous I would cut myself a lot at first, but not at all the case.  I love the weight of it, how easy it is to clean (I switch over to the strongest setting on my shower head with hot water to quickly get out all the gunk inside), how easy it is to change blades, and how smooth my legs feel!</li>
    <li> Finally I can get away from buying those ridiculously expensive razor blades that will fit only one model of razor. With this old fashion design the cheap double edge razors are again viable. The razors have to be purchased via the internet but are very cheap.</li>
    <li> This has been fantastic.  Has a nice weight to it and is much easier to get a clear neck line and cheek line for my beard than which my previous multi-blade razor.</li>
    <li> I received my Merkur #180 2 days ago. Had plenty of growth on my face and decided to shave. By the way, although I had ordered the 10 pack of Merkur blades, the razor actually came with one Merkur Platinum coated blade - that was a pleasant surprise. No cuts, no nicks, I went slow and enjoyed a real shave. This is not a \\&quot;butterfly opening\\&quot; type of razor. It consists of 3 parts: the top and middle pieces, and the handle. The top and middle pieces fit together in order to sandwich and bend the blade to the correct angle and the handle screws into the top piece .  A quality piece of shaving hardware, well worth the money, should last a lifetime or two if not longer. Get one, you&#x27;ll be glad you did. Also let the wife use it with a fresh blade, she enjoyed it and we&#x27;ll be getting her a Merkur of her own!  UPDATE: Finish is chipping in places which means smooth shaves are a thing of the past for this razor. Started out great but didn&#x27;t last nearly as long as I had thought it would...</li>
    <li> The long, heavy handle gives it brilliant balance. Shaving made effortless!</li>
    <li> I remember the day I purchased the new 5 blade razor from Gillette.  I was excited and hopeful that FINALLY I wouldn&#x27;t have to deal with razor burn, bumps, etc anymore.  Alas, 5 blades aren&#x27;t better than 4, just as 4 blades weren&#x27;t better than 3, so on and so forth.  As it turns out you just need one simple little blade to do the trick.    After reading the article &#x27;How to Shave Like Your Grandpa&#x27; ([...]) I decided to switch to a high quality shaving cream, badger brush, and aftershave lotion.  I also purchased the Merkur razor and extra blades.  The difference cannot be put into words.  The best I can do is &#x27;simply amazing&#x27;.  I never, never get any kind of irritated skin post-shave.  I cannot feel one bit of stubble afterwards, even if I run my hand against the grain.  The quality of the shave is unsurpassed (at least for at-home shaves.  Straight blade shaves are a different story).    There is a slight learning curve to this product.  I have never (knock on wood) cut myself but finding the right angle is a bit tricky.  You&#x27;ll learn quickly and the time it takes to shave will become shorter and shorter.  But, even though I have the process down to a science it does take me a bit longer than a cheapie razor but I look at shaving as an indulgent experience now; I know my girlfriend appreciates it.    I cannot recommend this product enough.  I tried probably 100 different ways to rid myself of irritation and never found it until I tried a Merkur razor.  You will not be disappointed with this razor or the results.    ***Updated: 02/05/09***    I have tried many different brands of blades for this razor.  Nothing compares to the Merkur blades.  Just FYI...</li>
    <li> I got tired of expensive, multi-blade razors that really didn&#x27;t do that good of a job and went back to a single, quality blade. This as a great razor. The long handle makes it easy to handle, even with wet hands. Excellent razor, well made and perfectly balanced.</li>
    <li> Great Razor , This thing seems sturdy and affordable when compared with any alternative</li>
    <li> Great razor! I did some research before buying, and found this specific model to be at the top of most reviews. I see why.&lt;br /&gt;It has a good weight and balance, and feels like quality.</li>
    <li> I decided to ditch the Sensor/Mach 3/Fusion thing and get into the double-edge \\&quot;safety razor\\&quot; rerto thing and I&#x27;ve been looking for just the pefect razor. I tried a vintage Gillette Slim Boy adjustatale which was pretty good--except that the \\&quot;adjustment\\&quot; dial has no discernible effect--and a new off-brand Parker which is just so-so. Now this.    The good thing. It&#x27;s very clean stainless steel with a nice long handle. It feels good to hold.     But: It doesn&#x27;t shave close at all! The problem is that when you tighten the handle all the way, the blade is pressed down so hard against the body of the razor that it&#x27;s not able to really reach the hair. I found that if I unscrew the handle slightly and let the blade rise up a little bit, it shaves really close. But then you&#x27;re dealing with a loose razor head and it seems like you&#x27;re risking slashing yourself.    Also, the three-piece razor is much less convenient than the Gillette butterfly system, both for changing blades and for rinsing the blade. Also, if you want to keep track of which edge of the blade you are shaving with, so that you can use one side for a few shaves and then switch to the other, you can&#x27;t tell which side you&#x27;re using--The razor is completely symmetrical with no way to differentiate either side. I used a magic marker to mark one side, but it washes off. Seems to me they should place some sort of permanent mark or logo to distinguish the two sides.    Finally, for what they charge, Merkur is evidently too damn cheap to give you ANYTHING extra. No case or pouch or even a plastic cover to protect the razor head if you&#x27;re throwing this thing in a kit or taking it somewhere. Heck, even a disposable Bic comes with a cover for the head!    Bottom line: OK, but Merkur could have easily made it better.</li>
    <li> I bought this product in an attempt to get away from disposable razors that become dull very quickly.    This razor cuts skin very well but fails miserably at the task of cutting facial hair. Scrape, lather, scrape, lather, rinse, etc., and the stubble remains. Even an electric razor will provide a closer shave than this product. I am disappointed.</li>
    <li> Getting back in wet shaving due to the increasing cost of a decent cartridge razor and replacement cartridges. I did some research which pointed out that the longer handle of this razor makes the transition easier and I would agree.  I has a nice feel and good grip even with wet hands.  The blade centers nicely and the three piece construction is not as cumbersome as I thought it might be.  Very satisfying shave, not too harsh, but if you&#x27;re new to the process a styptic or alum block is recommended.  Overall a good quality razor at a good price.</li>
    <li> Purchased this product to better my shaving experience.  This product definitely delivers. The upfront cost is slightly higher than some of the name brand multi blade razors, but long term the cost is fractional.  I bought this razor and a package of 100 replacement blades ~$17, around $50 for both.  The 100 blades should last between 2 and 3 years of shaving every day.  I have a thick beard which was dulling my Gillette Fusion in about a week of daily shaving.  I have been using the same blade for about 2 weeks now and it is still giving an amazing clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor looks fantastic as well.  I have it in a stand with my brush and as you can see it looks great!  If you are planning on getting a stand for this razor I highly recommend getting the long handle as it just barley fits in my current stand compared to the shorter handle option, which I don&#x27;t think would fit.</li>
    <li> Very well built and it looks awesome to boot. This is the perfect razor for anyone wanting to start out or for seasoned safety shavers.</li>
    <li> My first safety razor. I like it a lot.  No need for me to ever buy another one. I&#x27;d buy it again, It does the job.</li>
    <li> I own this razor and the shorter Merkur classic #178. They are both excellent razors. The handle on this one is just the right length for people used to using modern razors... in fact it allows me to shave twice as fast as the 178 because the longer handle feels so much more secure in my hand and makes the razor much more easy to maneuver and handle.     The Merkur blades are much sharper than any 4-5 blade gillette cartridge and last for about a week. That&#x27;s about how long my Gillette cartridges were good for as well. You can get a whole years worth of blades for this thing for $20-30.    Stop shredding your cash and buy this razor... it&#x27;s easy to use, even for beginners, and is built solidly and should last for a lifetime. 6 stars.    Cons: Only con is that it took me so long to discover that these razors even existed! I&#x27;ll never look back.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this razor for his face. I tried his once. The razors made for women are just a total waste of money. $10+ for a razor, $15+ for the refills, ridiculous. Those are the good ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blade that came with this razor is fine for underarms and panty line, but not good enough for legs. I am currently using the ASTRA Superior Platinum blade.</li>
    <li> When the blades for my old double blade razor \\&quot;disappeared\\&quot; from existence (i.e., Are no longer available so that I will have to buy a new razor.), I decided to go back to the Old School.  This razor is great!  I have small hands, but like the long handle, weight, and balance.  I&#x27;ll never have to buy over-priced, plastic junk again.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice razor but the only issue is it only takes Merkur razors maybe. Bought another kind but they seem small.</li>
    <li> It broke!!  The screw that apparently holds the whole thing together is susceptible to use.  Unfortunately, I use my razor every day.  Poor purchase!  I understand that many have had success with this razor.  I am not one of them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 19 year old female who was sick of messing with disposable razors; not getting a consistent close shave, razor burn, nicks, cuts, etc. I thought there HAD to be an alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A friend of mine recommended a safety razor. I was immediately thrilled, and embarked on my mission to find the perfect one. (She bought hers at Lehmans and it works fine. Might want to check that one out, too. Hers was gold, however the one listed was a plain silver one. Didn&#x27;t care for it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After much research, I found that, for shaving legs, I would need a long handled razor. Check. A good weight for close shave. Check. Grips so it doesn&#x27;t slip. Check.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works beautifully! Although, if there are razors with a longer handle, I would get that one. Sure, it would be freakishly long, but for shaving legs, that would make my having to contort my body to shave a little less necessary. The grips work fine, but it still gets slippery and flies out of my hand. If you take the precautions and 1) MOISTURIZE. I use coconut oil. 2) Hot water and/or steam to open pores. VERY NECESSARY to get a good, close shave. 3) MOISTURIZE. Water, oil, and a milk based soap seems to do the job. (Goats milk)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go slow; shaving with this beauty requires a kind of skilful art. But don&#x27;t let that scare you; patience is the key to master the art. Slowly shave up the leg, and do it in small sections. Watch a few youtube videos; all of them seem to be men shaving their face, but imitate their movements. Shave according to the hairline. DON&#x27;T USE PRESSURE!!!! Let weight of the handle do all the work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow these tips, and you will have the softest legs. You&#x27;ll never want to go back to safety razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Below is a link to the blades I bought; I am very satisfied with them. I might experiment with others in the future; good amount for a good price. Each blade lasts me about 4 shaves. It&#x27;s amazing to see how much money you&#x27;ll save with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B003BWQX46 100 Shark Super Chrome Double Edge Safety Razor Blades]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, someone mentioned that the finish began to come off the razor.

    <li> excellent feel and touch. do not feel it will knick me in any way.</li>
    <li> I have used this for two months now.&lt;br /&gt;I am getting the best shaves of my life, and the shave is so comfortable I sometimes have to check that the blade is contacting my face.&lt;br /&gt;A wonderful choice for any wet-shaver, particularly a new one</li>
    <li> this is a much better deal than disposable blades..disposable blades are a ripoff.&lt;br /&gt;Product was received quickly and as described.</li>
    <li> My husband requested that I pick up some new heads for his razor and I was shocked to see how expensive those darned things are...and he&#x27;s always complaining that he can&#x27;t get a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t particularly familiar with the pricing because I have my granny&#x27;s mid-century safety razor and buy blades in 100-packs.  I&#x27;ll admit, it&#x27;s weird to tell people you shave with your grandmother&#x27;s razor...but with the right blades it&#x27;s the best thing this side of waxing.&lt;br /&gt;So, rather than spend a mint on &amp;#34;high tech&amp;#34; razors that don&#x27;t give him the shave he wants, I asked if he&#x27;d like to try something &amp;#34;new&amp;#34;.  After checking the reviews, we settled on the Merkur and weren&#x27;t disappointed. It&#x27;s well made and fits well in my hubs&#x27;s manly hands.&lt;br /&gt;He&#x27;s very pleased after just a few days and is now happily trying different blades and fine adjustments.</li>
    <li> My physical features can be rather detrimental sometimes, namely my thick and extremely rugged hair has a way of destroying razor blades after very few uses. Due to this unfortunate variable I have been forced to use low end products and have a shitty shave or purchase the more expensive alternatives(gilette and the like) and shell out a LOT of money to get baby-ass cheeks. After being head over heels in this dilemma since I&#x27;ve been young(from 14 to 21/now) I found this old school shaving method and decided this JUST might be what I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got the product a few days ago and have been using it everyday. The beneficial aspects far outweigh the detrimental ones, but let me lay out a basic premise for this tool:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Very sharp and stainless steel blades that are easily changeable and cheap&lt;br /&gt;-Requires precision and focus, there is a learning curve before you can use it properly because it will cut the shit out of the sharper edges on one&#x27;s face&lt;br /&gt;-Takes more time then other shaving utensils due to required steady process&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those are the main three points that I raise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave is pretty good, up there with the expensive shaving pieces(at least once you get the hang of it). All in all, would recommend. Good product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried shaving with this about 10 times and each time I finish with a lot of hair and blood on my face.  Yes, I know it&#x27;s probably my fault that I&#x27;m bad a shaving with this...but as someone who has been shaving since they were 15,  I would think it would at least get slightly better after 10 shaves.  Maybe it&#x27;s my hair, maybe it&#x27;s my incredible strength, but for some reason I either end up with lots of hair left, lots of blood and razor burn, or both!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I&#x27;ll try again some day, but for now it&#x27;s hiding under the sink while I go back to Schick Hydro 5 razors....</li>
    <li> I was tired of cartridge razors as I could only shave once a week because of the ridiculous razor burn. I read that safety razors were the way to go. So I decided to give it a try. This razor has been nothing short of a shaving miracle. The quality is top notch. And the shave it gives is outstanding. Not to aggressive but I am always left with a bbs (baby butt smooth) shave that does not irritate my face. I shave every other day now. This and a brush and proper shave soap/cream have turned a once dreaded practice into an enjoyable ritual that I look forward to. 5 stars and a strong recommendation for anyone looking to dip their toes into wet shaving.</li>
    <li> Legit. Look for the package deal if your interested in a DE shave set up</li>
    <li> With patience, this product will give a much better shave than all of the triple-bladed disposable razors on the market.  The weight feels good in the hand.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor on a whim.  I have been a devout Gillette Mach 3 user since they sent me a care package 12  years ago for joining the Army.  Unfortunately, the razors are getting more expensive and I don&#x27;t believe more razors on a head equate to a better shave.  After reading many reviews (both positive and negative) I decided to throw caution to the wind and purchased this Merkur Safety razor.  It is an investment well made.  The shave is very smooth and consistent.  The razor has been used several times, and my shave is as fresh as the first day I used the blade.  I highly recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a Mach 3 razor since I was 16, and before that I used a Sensor Excel. Both were great razors, and they worked well on my face. Now I&#x27;m 30, and the past 6 months or so my face has been getting torn up by the Mach 3. I had a sample pack of the Fusion razors, and they were very better but just ridiculously expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the Merkur 180 at a local knife shop about a month ago, and have used a pack of Merkur blades with it since then.  The Merkur is very solidly built, simple to maintain, and when used properly, doesn&#x27;t have too many variables to cause problems. It&#x27;s not complicated, and for those new to DE shaving, it will not be a wildcard in terms of finding the best methods for your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DE shaving, for someone who has never done so before, is a process of learning. I&#x27;ll just throw in my setup and experience for reference:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Merkur 180 Handle&lt;br /&gt;(once I get used to this, it will be my travel razor, plan to get a Futur)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Merkur Platinum blades&lt;br /&gt;(nice blades, looking at Astra blades for my next set)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Art of Shaving Lavender Oil, Cream, and Balm&lt;br /&gt;(tried Williams Mug Soap, not good on my face. might try Taylor of Old Bond Street for my next round of cream. my wife got me some Clinique Men&#x27;s after shave balm that I&#x27;ll be using soon)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Van der Hagen Brush and Bowl set&lt;br /&gt;(got this at Wal Mart. the soap it came with was terrible, but the brush and bowl are functional and not expensive. It&#x27;s not badger, but I&#x27;m not running a shaving museum in my house.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this has been a really fun experiment, and after a few weeks, my face is very accustomed to the new shaving style. The biggest things I had to change were: shave after showering (not before like I&#x27;d always done) and use very short strokes (the proper angle is important!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are tons of resources online for supplies and methods, but if you&#x27;re new to DE shaving one thing is for certain: you won&#x27;t go wrong with the Merkur 180. I&#x27;m very happy with my investment, and it sure looks like it will last for years.</li>
    <li> I have never had a closer shave in my life. The razor feels good in my hand and is a good weight. I was nervous at first, but I have only nicked myself maybe three times in the past month of owning it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Men, you owe it to your wives and girlfriends to get a safety razor. They will really appreciate how smooth your face is.</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t really review something i don&#x27;t use since i don&#x27;t shave my face. My husband has been using this and it&#x27;s working fine.  a good looking serious razor--appears well-made but we&#x27;ve only had it a few weeks.  I opted for the longer handle really don&#x27;t know why.</li>
    <li> For my son Christmas he wanted a razor and other item so that is what I got him and he likes them</li>
    <li> this has ended my need to continue to purchase disposable costly razors- love the weight &amp; german quality :)</li>
    <li> Perfect, nicely weighted, good shave. Good bye disposable razors.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for a year now and really enjoy it. Works great and no signs of wear or rust.</li>
    <li> Exceptional quality. I have 2 because I travel often.</li>
    <li> I love this razor. I stopped shaving a few years ago because it really bothered my skin. Using this razor along with Proraso Shaving Cream With Eucalyptus Oil &amp; Menthol (5.2 oz.), Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush, and Feather Hi-Stainless Platimum Double Edge Razor Blades have been the best shaving experience I have ever had. I actually look forward to shaving now. The build quality of this razor is excellent, and the chrome finish is beautiful. I have no doubt that I&#x27;ll be using this razor for many years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: One thing I have discovered, and I&#x27;ve seen it in other reviews, is that you HAVE to shave with low pressure; let the weight of the razor do the work. If you press too hard, you will experience some severe razor burn. My face is still recovering, but I have learned my lesson. I strongly suggest all of the products mentioned above. I will be reviewing them as well.</li>
    <li> I had used the Mach 5 and really liked it, but dreaded buying the replacement cartridges due to the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does a great job with a single blade without taking too much more time and is much cheaper to buy replacement blades for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to the size curved top piece it can be a little hard to get really close under your nose, but it is doable. Otherwise you may want to keep one plastic safety razor or electric razor around to trim the upper mustache. You will nick yourself once in a while, definitely more often than the plastic razors, but unless you are being completely reckless it&#x27;s really not that often or that bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product and it exactly matches my expectations. A little more work than a blade like the Mach5, but ridiculously less expensive to maintain.</li>
    <li> once you get used to the the technique it is vastly superior to any multiblade i&#x27;ve ever used. highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This was my first double edged safety razor, and I went with it because of all the great reviews I saw. This thing is great! I haven&#x27;t had any issues shaving with it, and I&#x27;ve actually felt better shaving with this than I have any other time in my life. Compared to a regular shaver, I think this is a better option because it&#x27;s so simple and so smooth when you&#x27;re shaving with this (at least for me). Definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not normally a person who writes reviews. I can only think of a handful of reviews I&#x27;ve written, and I&#x27;ve only done so because the products were absolutely amazing. This Merkur safety razor is one of them. I have always had very thick stubble and sensitive skin that has been irritated by most cartridge razors on the market (Fusion, Mach 3, etc.) no matter how careful I was. I came to believe razor burn was simply a fact of life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, then I decided to start researching alternative methods and came upon safety razors. I had read that Merkur was a respected brand and decided I would try using a safety razor. All I can say is, &amp;#34;wow.&amp;#34; The first time I used this razor it hadn&#x27;t even felt like I shaved. With the proper technique is glides smoothly across your face, gives you a close shave, and causes no razor burn. As a further testament to how good it is, I tried shaving against the grain for the first time in probably 10 years. I&#x27;ve avoided doing this in the past because it just made my razor burn exponentially worse. The shave was still extremely comfortable and did not leave my skin irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other great benefit to using this safety razor is how cheap it is. The replacement blades are super cheap, especially if you shop around. I was used to paying $15-20 for a 5 pack of replacement cartridges with my old razors. Now I can literally buy a box of 100 blades for &amp;#60;$10. I use Astra and they last me a good 3-4 shaves even with really thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps the only downside to this razor is that it requires a bit more time and care to use but this is really minimal. The mechanics are very similar to using a cartridge razor, but I&#x27;d still recommend watching a few YouTube videos to see how to shave properly. As for the time part, I&#x27;d say shaving takes maybe 1-2 minutes longer if that. If you pair it with a good shaving brush and soap, shaving actually becomes something enjoyable so I don&#x27;t mind the extra time (never thought I&#x27;d say that).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a person like me who has had to deal with razor burn and irritation for years and are one the fence, I&#x27;d say go for it. You won&#x27;t be disappointed. For those of you who don&#x27;t have problems shaving but want to try something new, still go for it. Shaving with a safety razor is a far more enjoyable experience than the typical style of cartridge razor shaving most of us have grown up with.</li>
    <li> Nice balance, simple to use, smooth, came with two razors so I haven&#x27;t used the 100 Astra razors I purchased at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;I shave both my face and entire head. It took some getting used to, but after about a week, I got the hang of it. Since the head does not pivot, you have to angle the razor to make sure the cutting angle is correct. Once you train yourself, the razors works just as good as these modern 3 and 4 razor blade heads, just a lot less expensive. I will not go back!!&lt;br /&gt;If you want to save more money I recommend getting the shaving soap, a mug and brush. It&#x27;s a lot let mess, quick and easy. Just get the brush damp whip it up on the soap. It foams up enough to shave, then put it away.</li>
    <li> Difficult to load a blade. One must dissemble to top portion of the razor; it comes completely apart. Would recommend a butterfly style as it is easier to load and clean.</li>
    <li> Great razor, the handle is nice. It has a great look and leaves you with a close shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty green so I&#x27;m always looking for ways to reduce my carbon footprint.  Sometimes my decisions work (like with this razor) and other times they don&#x27;t (like the time I tried switching to natural deodorant).  From the reviews I was worried I&#x27;d have to go really slow and be super careful about cutting myself.  That was not the case at all.  I use this for shaving my legs and underarms.  Here&#x27;s the skinny:&lt;br /&gt;1 - I do have to hold it at a different angle against my skin than I did with my disposable razor.  With my disposable razor I probably angled the razor about 30 degrees.  With this one its more like a 70 degree angle&lt;br /&gt;2 - I do have to go over the area twice.  With my disposable razor my legs were smooth after one pass. With this one it takes 2 passes to get it just as smooth BUT the smoothness lasts a few days longer than my disposable razor&lt;br /&gt;3 - Its not scary sharp.  Alot of reviews talk about being careful about getting nicked.  Maybe that&#x27;s the case for your face, but for my legs and underarms I have yet to get nicked.  I do have to be careful when it comes to cleaning the blade though.  Its important to remember to grab the blade at the sides which I forgot a few times.&lt;br /&gt;4 - my skin looks and feels so much better.  even though the blade is sharp it only removes the hair, not the skin.  with my disposable razor if I were to try and do a salt scrub afterwards I would die (that&#x27;s how i knew it was taking off skin).  But with this razor I could totally do it with no stinging at all.  Also, with my disposable razor, my underarms were darker than the rest of my skin.  with this razor my underarm skin color is now the same as the rest of my arm and it makes me more comfortable when I wear sleeveless stuff&lt;br /&gt;5 - its better for the environment and your wallet.  the razor is made of stainless steel (i believe) and won&#x27;t rust.  the blades are also stainless steel and come like 100 in a pack for $5 or something.  At that rate, it will be like 5 years before I need to restock on a razor and way cheaper than what I was spending on my mach 5.  also there&#x27;s no plastic to throw away&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in summary, I love this razor.  Its easy to use, great on my skin, good for the environment, and easy on my wallet.  I definitely recommend getting one.</li>
    <li> A nice beginner razor for those experinting with safety razors the only problem is my handle needs to be re tightened four or five times during the shave, an annoying thing I imagine the butterfly style does not have.  Edit after several months the threading from the handle and the head is almost completely worn out, requiring the head to be retightened after each pass of the beard. Too much diddling with for my taste, I am going to try the butterfly style next.</li>
    <li> Love this little guy. 10 shaves in. Easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Great product!! So much better then those overpriced multiple blades</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t be happier with this razor. The blades are very affordable and it does a great job of shaving my face and head. I would buy this product again in a heart beat.</li>
    <li> This was the best hygiene decision I&#x27;ve made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Durable&lt;br /&gt;- Inexpensive blade refills&lt;br /&gt;- Very good shave, I mean really really good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was super sensitive to even the best electric razors.  I tried pretty much everything and this razor, the Proraso shaving soap, and the sample kit of blades saved the day.  I&#x27;ve been using for about a year and it is just awesome.  I can&#x27;t really tell the difference between the various blade brands.  A brand new blade feels best, after a week of use I can tell the blade is not brand new, but even after 3 or so weeks of use on the same blade the performance is still better than the best 3 triple blade disposable.</li>
    <li> The long handle makes it really easy to use if you have bigger hands or long fingers like I do. It is very easy to clean but needs a good once over about once a month to keep it shiny. Overall a great product.</li>
    <li> Awesome blade! I will never use anything else. It has been perfect.</li>
    <li> When I first purchased this razor, I hadn&#x27;t realized that it didn&#x27;t have a butterfly opening. I did like the shave, which turned out to be closer and more comfortable than cartridge shaving. All the same, I was looking for the convenience of a butterfly opening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I ordered a new razor from Ambroley (ASIN: B00K70TS0Q). I used the Ambroley razor for about a week, but I won&#x27;t be using it again. Every shave left 4-6 new cuts. Trying to shave slowly and carefully didn&#x27;t help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There could be many explanations for the difference. It may be that the Ambroley does not hold the blade in place as firmly the Merkur.  My best guess is that the edge of the Merkur may offer better protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whatever the real explanation may be, I continue to have a comfortable and close shave with the Merkur. I no longer care that it doesn&#x27;t have a butterfly opening, and I&#x27;m happy to rate it as a 5 star purchase.</li>
    <li> Great balance, looks, chrome, just a great shave.  As long as the Zamak metal used holds up over the years then this will be a great razor but no heirloom. However, the all brass vintage Gillettes can&#x27;t be beat and can last 2 lifetimes if maintained.  Too bad nobody makes them like that anymore.  Good thing I bought a few older ones already to set back.</li>
    <li> Works good enough for this beginner.  Careful you screw the plates back in correct didnt realize at first it was inverted after changing blades and it wasnt cutting.  My bad.</li>
    <li> Purchased this as my first safety razor after several recommendations to do so.  It&#x27;s a great, solid piece of stainless steel that should last quite some time.  The replacement razor are much cheaper than anything else out there, and if you take your time and shave correctly (multiple lather and passes), it&#x27;s a much better shave than a Mach 5 or whatever nonsense is out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save yourself some money, class it up and shave like your grandfather.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of months now and all I can say is wow! The shaves a close and comfortable and I have already saved $46 in blades. The Feather Blades which I got here. [[ASIN:B00AGG3MNU Feather Double Edge Blades Count]] Last Forever with this handle. It&#x27;s easy to use and easy to clean. The blades last me on average about a week to two weeks which means just one purchase of those 50 Feather Blades will last me an entire year! I pair this handle with some vitamin E oil I buy at the local shop with some standard Aloe shave cream. All in all I could not possibly be happier with this purchase. My shaves are closer than ever and most importantly costing me pennies compared to my old Mach whatever.</li>
    <li> Just Received my Merkur 180 and was excited to change from my Mach 3 to a Safety Razor. My first impression on the Merkur is how great it looks and the Heft of the metal. I had heard about the Merkur HD and thought the 180 might be a little light, but let me tell you its plenty heavy and the long diamond etched handle gives it a great feel. I used the blade that came with the razor(a Merkur Platinum) and had my first shave. I definitely need to practice with this a few shaves to feel it out but I still got a decent shave the first time, I did three passes (with, across, against the grain) and got the same close shave i get with two passes on my Mach 3. I think with more practice I&#x27;ll get a even better shave. I ordered a sample pack of blades and will try some out to see if I get better results than the Merkur. I also was a little concerned about cutting myself, but after using it I had No Cuts and finding the cutting angle was pretty easy also no razor burn. Overall the Razor works, it Feels great, and Looks Great. I think I can get a baby smooth shave with some practice and blade trials. I Highly recommend this product for new DE razor buyers, I think you will enjoy the quality and easy of use.</li>
    <li> At first, the razor was hard on my skin. I had to make sure that I was very careful not to cut myself. After two weeks of regular shaving, though, my skin got used to it and I can confidently shave with it. I was drawn to this razor not just for a good shave, but to save on plastic use! The plastic safety razors I had been using were expensive and wasteful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a smooth (and less expensive shave), I find that I get the best shave right after a shower, and use baby oil as a preshave. Then I use regular old shaving cream and finish with cool water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a great product.</li>
    <li> Worked great, still learning but i think it should be heavier. I also wish the handle was longer, it feels like i am using a golf pencil for a handle.</li>
    <li> The machining on this razor is very well done. I can see it lasting for a very long time, most likely longer than I&#x27;ll be around on this earth. Think about that.</li>
    <li> Yes, the upfront cost of this razor is expensive, but it pays for itself over the course of a year.  Plus, you&#x27;ll get a better shave.  I was stunned on what a good shave it gives and I didn&#x27;t get any nicks or cuts.  And my skin was less irritated than my Sensor 3.  Multiple blades are a marketing gimmick.  They provide a nice shave, but are difficult to use in hard to reach areas, irritate the skin, and cost a fortune over time.  I&#x27;ve had to buy them as the companies discontinue the older models in favor of their expensive multi-blade models.  But this razor does a great job and I&#x27;ll probably have it for a decade.  It gets 4 stars because I still need a regular razor to get under my nose as it just doesn&#x27;t reach the area by my nostrils.  But this razor provides a great shave, will save me money, and I was surprised that its basically fool proof to avoid nicks and cuts.  Very pleased.  Oh, and shaving soap actually cleans my skin and pours instead of shaving cream which always leave an acne causing reside.  UPDATE:  I used the Merkur for about 3 months, but have gone back to my old Gillette Sensor razor.  While the Merkur works, the shave is not as close as my Sensor.  I typically shave every other day, sporting the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow on the day because I jsut don&#x27;t want to shave every day.  But with the Merkur I found I had to shave everyday.  This irritated my skin.  I also found the blade gets dull pretty quick and its annoying to keep track of which side of the blade you use this time. The razor also failed to shave under my nose.  After several cuts and extra maneuvering, I gave up and used my old razor for under my nose.  Two razor seemed counter productive.  Finally, this razor will cut you.  I expected that, but the cuts were typically on my neck.  After ruining a few shirts with bloodstains on the collars, not getting as close a shave, and constantly disassembling the razor to keep it dry and track the blade, I gave up and went back to my Gillette multi-bladerazor.  The shave is faster, better and all around superior.  I really wanted to like this razor, but it failed to deliver.</li>
    <li> This was a great discovery for me....the best shaves I&#x27;ve had in my entire life.  All you need is one good blade...the three blade razors are a scam and don&#x27;t work as good.</li>
    <li> not only an extremely functional razor, but it looks great as well. The handle is only average length, so I wonder at how short the non-&amp;#34;long handled&amp;#34; versions may be. Replacing razors is a cinch. Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> Love it, I used disposable razors with like 5 blades forever, this thing is a dream comparatively. I have sensitive skin and this lets me shave within 24 hours (PM one day, AM the next) with no irritation. Once you learn how to use it, it&#x27;s literally hard to cut yourself.</li>
    <li> I like the simplicity of this razor. The three piece design makes it really to clean when dissasemled. The long handle makes easier to control than shorter handled razor. It fits the hand better. With a feather hi-stainless blade I receive a great shave. I highly recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> I gave it to my husband as a gift for our anniversary and he was thrilled. He said he finally felt like a real man now that he was shaving with a classy blade.</li>
    <li> When I told my dad I started using a safety razor, he shook his head woefully and said I&#x27;d better be extra careful. Cut myself real easy.  Not true at all. I have certainly nicked myself here and there, but no worse than any Gillette has done.  That said, I really like the way this razor feels in the hand. It has me wondering what a short handle would look like, since this one is not really that long to speak of -- just right, I&#x27;d say. This piece of metal definitely feels like it will last my entire lifetime, and I can&#x27;t ask more than that. If you make sure to choose your blades carefully, this thing will do the trick.</li>
    <li> All I have to say is WOW! I wish I would have had one of theses razors when I was on active duty. I got really tired of paying so much for replacement heads for the Mach 3 and the Fusion, that seem to go dull so fast.  I highly recommend this product.  The razor does not pull hairs or drag across the skin, it seems to just glide. Get a good shaving soap and badger hair brush and get to shaving! If you have never shaved with a brush and soap puck there is a lot of good videos on YouTube that will show you how to use them.  Don&#x27;t be scared of this type of razor, it is really easy to use!  I will never use another type or razor again!</li>
    <li> My husband talked me into ditching the disposable razors and going with a Merkur Safety Razor.  He&#x27;d been very happy with his shorter handled version Merkur and learned a lot about proper shaving techniques before he ordered his.  Needless to say, he&#x27;s thrilled with his new razor and shaving routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely do some YouTubing research and ask around for tips if you know someone who uses a razor like this.  It&#x27;s important to use a light touch, especially around curves (knees, ankles) to avoid nicks.  Get the right soap and lather properly.  I found a cheap bar of almond glycerin soap that smells great and lathers up well with my shower pouf.  (It happens to be round and fits in a container I had saved.)  The glycerin helps the blade glide along.  Be patient and pay attention to your technique and you&#x27;ll be comfortable with this razor in no time, even in more sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Merkur blade that is included is not the best, but my husband bought a great sample pack of blades to try.  Everyone has different needs and preferences so it&#x27;s a good idea to get a variety and rate the ones you use.  Then simply buy your favorite blades in bulk and you&#x27;re done shopping for razors for a long time.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using plastic razors his whole shaving life. I saw an online review of this razor and decided to purchase it for him because he has always had razor bumps on his neck after shaving. He was doubtful at first, but he has really warmed up to it and has noticed a significant decrease on his razor bumps/burns on his neck after shaving. Great product of very high quality.</li>
    <li> If I had all the money back I have wasted on those Gillete blades over the past 20 years I could probably retire. I am 34 years old and I started out with a cartridge just like everybody in my generation. We were scammed guys. This is the closest and easiest shave I have ever had. I have a beard that is so corse that I can only get one to two shaves out of a Fusion blad. I can shave four times with this Merkur and now that I have learned to use it, in half the time. It is so simple, easy to use, and best of all the BLADES ARE CHEAP!!!! I got 100 Crystal \\&quot;SUPER +\\&quot; Platinum Double Edge Safety Razor Blades here at Amazon for 17.99 for 100 blades. So basically that means I get roughly 400 shaves for around 18$ as opposed to 24 shaves for 28$. You do not have to be a math wiz to figure out that the cartridge razor is a rip off. Get this razor you will thank me.</li>
    <li> Love this safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s my first. You won&#x27;t automatically get a closer shave just by using it, but the sharp, single-blade approach allows you to get a closer shave on multiple passes without irritation. I haven&#x27;t felt any learning curve upgrading from the Mach 3: no cuts or anything. Plus, in the long-run it&#x27;s cheaper to buy a good safety razor and a pack of blades than it is to buy those cartridges--greener too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weight of the blade in my hand feels great while I shave. Plus, my wife thinks its badass.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wet shaving for years but I&#x27;ve always used the cartridge-style systems with the gazillion blades, swivel hinges and all the bells and whistles that the marketing people will sell you for good (and hard earned, I should add) money.&lt;br /&gt;Hearing from a relative, that he went to straight-edge shaving I studied the pros and cons of the DE Safety Razor, since I&#x27;m a busy traveller and can&#x27;t see myself learning the art of straight-edge shaving without killing myself at least once or twice (yeah I know!).&lt;br /&gt;Reading countless reviews led me to this very Razor, so I went for it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve just gotten through my second shave and I&#x27;m really getting the hang of it. As a matter of fact, it&#x27;s even fun to use because while getting a real close and smooth shave with minimal to no irritation (I seem to have sensitive-to-shaving skin) you&#x27;re not breaking the bank because first of all it comes with a Merkur Super Blade and also you can buy blades for fairly cheap compared to the cartridges which can show up in the books at around $15-$20 for 5 Cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;One thing I have learned is, that you don&#x27;t need more than one blade, no pads, lips, hinges, lights, lasers, pyrotechnics to get a great shave.&lt;br /&gt;All you need is a good quality razor with a decent weight and a Blade that fits your needs.&lt;br /&gt;Whenever I shaved with my Mach3 in this &amp;#34;close&amp;#34; intervals I cut myself everywhere even when going with the grain.&lt;br /&gt;This did NOT happen today. I only suffered from two very minor nicks in the neck area.&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;m gonna say, if you&#x27;re looking for a good, mild beginner&#x27;s model of a DE Safety Razor that will provide you with a great shave, go with this one.&lt;br /&gt;As for the Blade that was included I can say it works well, but I have yet to try different ones to see if I can do even better.</li>
    <li> ok...for the last few years i&#x27;ve been shaving with a really nice electric shaver. worked fine overall but always had trouble around my adams apple and always had to stand there forever if i wanted a truly close shave. however it recently broke and i had to switch to whatever that 5 blade razor is and i tell you...that was hell. epicly painful especially around the chin, buuut i was stuck with it. so when i got this razor plus the proraso and all the other things people reccomend...heaven... i look forward to shaving every morning and love how it has become a ritual. your face will feel amaaaaaazing...all day...get this...like just do it...now. every time you start your day with a nice slow shave then walk outside...and you feel that first cold gust of wind...think...i&#x27;m glad i listened to that guy!</li>
    <li> This razor is easy to control producing a nice close shave. Do not use more than the weight of the razor for pressure.</li>
    <li> A classic design with a long handle that provides a good shave for anyone new to DE shaving. It won&#x27;t break the bank and is a good purchase.</li>
    <li> I shave my face and head and had bought in to the lies marketing kept telling me about more blades being better.  I&#x27;d been using 3-blade razors for a while and tried 5 once, but they were too difficult to use as I spent more time trying to clean the thing than shaving.  For some reason, it never occurred to me that *fewer* blades might be helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally got around to trying this and feel so much retrospective shame due to the time and money I wasted on things that only made my life worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you, or someone you love shaves with disposables, buy this, a brush and a variety pack of razor blades and learn to do it right.  You will feel bad about yourself for a bit as you realize you could have been doing this all along, but that will pass as you start looking forward to doing this &amp;#34;chore.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I have spent the last two weeks reading about safety razors from various websites. I was extremely eager to try it considering the number of raving reviews. I am always a skeptic to claims that are exceedingly positive, regardless of the credibility of the person. Given this, I approached the Mercur Safety Razor with caution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am absolutely amazed at how close of a shave this produced. I have long been a victim of nicks and shaving burn as a result of my heritage. I have very sensitive(&amp;#34;baby-face&amp;#34;) skin coupled with the coarse hair of a Hispanic father. I have purchased every readily available mainstream razor, including my $300 electric shaver. The electric shaver was the only thing I have ever used that didn&#x27;t leave me with irritation. Since the electric is a self-cleaning model, I have to frequently spend the $10 required to replace solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the Mercur for the first time with the blade that came with it. It really did take forever to shave with it. I was impressed that I finished without cutting my face up, given that I shave against the grain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I was afraid of cutting myself, I started with the grain. I could not believe how close of a shave I received! Because I like my face to feel baby bottom smooth, I went back over against the grain. Still no irritation and no cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never again use anything other than a safety razor. I eager to see how much better the experience can be when I get some high quality shaving soap and a brush.</li>
    <li> Let me just mention few things about this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Its a first safety razor I have used. Therefore, it is going to take me some time to get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;2) I hate the disposable razors. I used Gillete Fusion and razors similar to it for some time now. I was wasting money on it. When I went to buy more blades, it said it was $16 for 5 of them. That&#x27;s when I decided to switch.&lt;br /&gt;3) This razor is solid. It is built nicely with no cheap parts and it is very simple to change blades on it. Simply unscrew the little top, put the razor in and put the top back on. See, simple.&lt;br /&gt;4) The razor came with one of the blades so you can try it right away. I also bought 125 sample pack of all kinds of razors here on Amazon to see which ones work best for me. I suggest you should do the same. You can see a review of them on my Amazon review page.&lt;br /&gt;5) The blade is easily cleaned. Just run it under water for few seconds or fill a bowl of water and just move the razor around for few seconds. The razor retains heat nicely so make sure to use warm water when you&#x27;re having a shave.&lt;br /&gt;6) Shaving with safety razor takes skill. If you are using it, take it slow. Each stroke takes precisions as these are not your commonly used razors. If you want a nice shave, devote some time to it and make it worth it.</li>
    <li> GREAT SHAVE EXPERIENCE. I AM NEW TO DOUBLE EDGE SHAVING AND I CAN&#x27;T BELIEVE WHAT A GOOD SHAVE THE MERKUR 180 GIVES ME. I&#x27;LL NEVER GO BACK TO HIGH DOLLAR, THROW AWAY RAZORS.</li>
    <li> Simple and solid! Nothing else like it. The only thing I would ever buy to replace it , might be a straight razor. Just for kicks.</li>
    <li> This is my first safety razor, after doing some research this looked like a great model to get my feet wet with safety razors. It does come with one blade as well to get you started, so you will need to order more from the get go as one will not last very long. Good thing is the blades are super cheap.</li>
    <li> My Opa in Germany always had one of these razors when I was growing up. I never saw him use anything else, and I decided I should buy one for my husband. (Razor cartridges can get expensive and he is in the military so he has to shave EVERY DAY). So far this is great, and we have yet to have to change the blade. Please note you have to be EXTREMELY careful with this razor. My husband used to shave a rabid speeds in the morning, and has learned to slow down with this blade. It is worth the extra time, his shave is so much smoother, and he doesn&#x27;t have a five o&#x27;clock shadow anymore. I would also recommend buying a shaving brush and shaving soap... he found this gives him better results as well. He has also found that he gets way less razor burn, which is defiantly a plus. I could rave on and on about the benefits of this razor but I will cut it short and say it is worth the buy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m African American with several Caucasian friends. Everyone that has tried DE shaving agrees no more razor bumps. I have no idea why the DE works do well considering I&#x27;m putting oil on my face before I shave but it doesn&#x27;t matter!!! These create the smoothest closet shave ever with no bumps. I&#x27;m sold!!!!</li>
    <li> Had these puppies engraved in Walnut Creek, price and quailty doesn&#x27;t get much better.  Groomsman will use and have these for rest of lives.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  It was not expensive and I saved a lot of money by switching to Merkur.  I would definately recommend..</li>
    <li> I was your typical Gillette Fusion Pro Glide and Sensor user for the last 23 years and just tried this Merkur 180 with the long handle this past week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WOW!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I use this razor with a Feather blade, I cut through my beard like butter.  It is not a little bit better than the Pro Glide, it is much better.  I feel ashamed of myself for continuing to give Gillette my money for their silly and painful cartridge systems.  The skin irritation is so much less, I feel like I discovered the find of the century.  I would recommend this razor with a decent sharp blade (Feather, Astra, or Personna Med Prep) to any man who has to, or wants to shave daily.  I finally now, in the 40th year of my life understand how a man can shave daily, look good without massive razor burn and actually enjoy the routine.  I will write more about this in the coming weeks, but for now, this is not a five star product, .... this is a twelve star product.</li>
    <li> This thing is built like a tank! Once it&#x27;s in your grip you can tell it&#x27;s going to last you many years. Unfortunately, the single razor and fixed angle makes shaving unforgiving and time-consuming. In order to get a good shave it would take continual re-heating of my face and multiple passes with the razor. Unless I was moving at a snails pace, I&#x27;d get some pretty wicked razor burn. I switched back to a Gillette Mach II Turbo and the difference is night and day. The Mach II gave me a much faster and smoother shave with very little hassle, while  shaving with the Merkur Model 180 was like shaving in the dark ages :(</li>
    <li> I bought the Mekur Model 180 (Item# 90.23.001) Razor, Made in Germany, about a month ago. Was not sure if this was a smart  move or not. Technology wise I felt I was going backwards but, I was totally fed up with the outrageous price of Cartridge Blades and Disposables, so I needed to make a change. I can say, even in a very short time, that this was definitely the best thing I could ever have done. I take my time shaving, actually enjoy it and end up with a extremely smooth, long lasting shave. I did look at other Double Edge Razors but after reading many reviews, the Merkur line had some of the best reviews overall. No need to buy a cheap razor anyway, with the cost savings from the double edge blades vs. the cartridges, you can afford a quality razor.&lt;br /&gt;A quick comment about blades, there&#x27;s tons to pick from, made everywhere. Feather Blades from Japan were too sharp for me, Merkur Blades from Germany were very nice but, I have settled on the Personna Blades, Made In USA. For me, they give me a great shave for a great price.</li>
    <li> I have been using this razor for about a year now, and I just love it! You do need to be careful when shaving as it is way easier to cut yourself, but if you take your time and pay attention, it is so worth it! I purchased 2 10 packs of feather blades with this razor and still have 2 left. Needless to say my shaving costs have been dramatically reduced! Also, get yourself a good badger hair brush, it makes such a difference when using this razor. There are several videos on the internet explaining techniques for shaving with a safety razor I strongly recommend watching a few!</li>
    <li> This is a great razor. After a bit of trial and error, I finally got it assembled perfectly and now I get the perfect shave.  I love the classic design and the weight of the razor.  I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have a funny face in that I need both an electric and manual shaver. I shave first with the electic and then touch up with the plastic shaver. Now trust me I&#x27;ve tried everyone under the sun ranging from the cheap to the expensive and I always have the same problem, cuts and nicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it took a bit to get used to it I can now shave without worry about cutting the heads off my moles, it doesn&#x27;t pull and hurt the way the plastic ones do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only negative is, for me at least, is that still once or twice a week I need to&amp;#34; touch up&amp;#34; my shaving, as it&#x27;s not quite as close. Hence 4 stars rather than five.But that is a small price to pay for not having to hack your face to pieces each day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your still shaving with a throw away shaver than I highly recommend you change to a single blade you&#x27;ll never go back&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Edit: also don&#x27;t bother with shaving cream anymore go the whole way and get a soap dish and brush, is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through two of these in two years. In each case the failure was the screw head separating from the top of the razor. I give it three stars because I like the shave. But the razor should last longer. My interim solution is to simply bore a hole in the top piece with a drill press and use a machine screw to hold the razor to the handle. It works, but it&#x27;s not very pretty.</li>
    <li> Good looking, simple, high quality, works well.</li>
    <li> Love it! Nothing fancy in the finished department, but simple and functional.</li>
    <li> This is probably the mildest DE razor I&#x27;ve ever used. Once unpackaged I loaded it with a brand new Feather Hi-Stainless blade, took a hot shower, lathered up with my usual Proraso shaving cream,then proceeded to treat myself to a super mild, COMPLETELY irritation free double edge razor shave! I thought the Feather Popular was a mild shaver, but this Merkur takes it to the next level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this razor specifically for the longer (4 inch) handle. I find the stubby, head-heavy razor designs unwieldy and unbalanced. 4 inches is perfect. Also I find extremely heavy razors more likely to inflict cuts and abrasions, particularly if they&#x27;re aggressive shavers to begin with. I get more control with a longer handled razor that puts weight back in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who would want this long handled Merkur beauty? The novice who is just getting into DE shaving and needs a shaver that is very forgiving of errors in technique. Or the seasoned DE pro that needs a clean shave but is recovering from a bit of irritation from their more aggressive shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I had finished the shave I splashed on some alcohol based Proraso aftershave and had zero burn - just the usual refreshing slap of cooling sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As usual with 3 piece razor designs, you need to exercise a bit of caution when blade handling during changes as opposed to butterfly opening designs. Always handle the shaver head by its ends (even when no blade is loaded as a habit-forming technique) as you screw the handle on and off. Other than that it is no different than any other type of shaving device, and transports you back to an era of shaving that men experienced more than 100 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Merkur has a winner here!</li>
    <li> Great for a beginner (like me).  Good weight, but it just isn&#x27;t gentlemanly enough, particularly with the hollow center in the handle.  Obviously it was only 30 bucks, but as soon as I used it, I immediately wanted a better razor.  This will probably become my back-up.&lt;br /&gt;Some people recommend the longer version to help transition from normal cartridge razors (e.g. Mach 3), but I don&#x27;t think this is a real problem.  Just go with a normal length.</li>
    <li> really great, solid razor. it&#x27;s made in germany of course, and made in germany it looks indeed. very solid. does take a bit of time to get angling right though since it&#x27;s very much unlike typical/ mainstream razors.</li>
    <li> I was in the market for a DE razor and I couldn&#x27;t figure out the differences between the popular ones listed so I went ahead and ordered 6 of them to do my own evaluation. I&#x27;ve tested the Merkur 180, Merkur 34c, Merkur Futur, Parker 99R, Parker 22R, and Edwin Jagger De89lbl. I personally rank the Merkur 180 as my favorite razor. It has a good solid grip pattern with the barber pole, it&#x27;s top heavy, and slim handle make it ideal for a head shave. The other ones just seem bulky.</li>
    <li> Old school shaving at its finest...I miss the barber using the straight razor on my neck and around the ears, but this is classic and comfortable to use</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy with my new safety razor.  I used to use the same razors as everyone else, believing that more blades equals a better shave.  I was dropping about 20 dollars a month on refills alone for my Fusion razor.  even with a new cartridge on, I would still end up with razor burn.  I knew there had to be something better out there.  So I went searching for it, and found this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving is similar to Painting in a sense.  If you take the time to prep correctly, the end result will turn out much better.  Just substituting this razor for your old one won&#x27;t get the job done.  My initial purchase consisted of this razor, the [[ASIN:B002ESYH5K Parker Safety Razor 100% Silvertip Badger Bristle Shaving Brush with Faux Petrified Wood Handle &amp; Free Brush Stand]], [[ASIN:B001XURHNY Colonel Conk Evernice Model 775 Chrome Safety Razor Stand]], and [[ASIN:B002NCRFJC The Art of Shaving The 4 Elements of The Perfect Shave Starter Kit, Sandalwood 1 kit]].  For a mug, I just use an old coffee mug I dug out of the cabinets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I wet my face thoroughly with hot water.  Then I apply the shaving oil.  Then, I run hot water on the inside and outside of the mug to heat it up.  I place a small amount of shaving cream in the mug, run hot water over the shaving brush and place it into the mug and stir.  Once the cream has a reached the desired consistency(I just try to get it worked into a nice lather) I use the brush to apply it to my face, then start shaving.  I place the brush on my face, and make small, quick strokes in the same direction as the grain.  once I&#x27;ve gone two inches, I rinse the razor and repeat until I&#x27;m done.  Then I rinse my face again and apply the aftershave lotion. This has provided the best results for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the Merkur razor, I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I no longer have razor burn, although the first couple times I shaved I nicked myself pretty good.  Once I found the correct amount of pressure to apply while shaving, I stopped cutting myself.  I am much better able to maneuver this razor around my face than with the old clunky ones.  My face feels much smoother and looks better now, I really am pleased with this product.utting myself.

    <li> I got this as a gift for my husband and he absolutely loves it. It was definitely a big change going from the Gillette that he used for years, but he got the hang of it in a couple of days with the help of some nice hot water, a silver tip badger hair brush, and good quality shaving soap. I got him a variety pack of blades to use to figure out which brand worked best for him. He now has a favorite blade and shaves every day with this razor. The blades are easy to change and it has held up well with no rust. Plus, the long-term money savings from not purchasing those gillette replacement heads has been awesome. Oh, and his face has never been smoother, he gets an incredibly close shave with this thing!</li>
    <li> Superb built quality. But the blade needs to find a good replacement because some of the blade is not suitable with shaver.</li>
    <li> I should have paid attention to that title. As promised the handle is long. A little too long for my razor rest, unfortunately, so watch out for that.</li>
    <li> Very nice build and weight.  The long handle makes it comfortable to maneuver.  I gave it 4 stars because don&#x27;t feel it gives an exceptionally close shave, but for the price I can&#x27;t really complain.  Paired with good blades, this is a very nice razor.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent safety razor for both first-time and veteran wetshavers.  I like a razor with a little bit more size and heft, and the long handled Merkur fulfills both of these criteria admirably.  Beyond that, the construction is simple and solid, and with a little effort (i.e. keep the razor clean and don&#x27;t store it in a steamy, wet bathroom all the time) this piece could easily last a lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;If this is your first foray into the world of wetshaving, I think this is one of the best options for your first razor.  Don&#x27;t listen to the nutjob shavegeeks who are telling you that you simply must start out with a $200+ straight razor with three different wetstones and a strop made of Italian cowhide.  Start with a solid safety razor like this one, use it for a while, and then decide if you want to jump further into the depths of shavedom.  I most recommend this razor if you&#x27;re making the change from a cartridge razor, as some safety razors can feel restrictively short compared to the Mach 3 you&#x27;ve been using since you were twelve and the added length on this razor&#x27;s handle is an added bonus that will help to ease the transition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;N.B. - The Merkur blades that come with the razor are fine, but usually pretty inconsistent in terms of sharpness—you gain a new appreciation for razor blades that are too sharp or too dull when they both come from the same package.  Go for something better, like Feathers or Astras; I myself swear by the &amp;#34;Super+&amp;#34; Israeli no-names.</li>
    <li> This razor will give you the best shave you&#x27;ve ever had! All of the big time shaving companies spend millions if not billions on marketing. All you need is one extremely sharp blade, not 5, and your face will be as smooth as a baby&#x27;s ass! Merkur is the best hands down. So forget about expensive cartridges, the blades are so cheap! Highly recommend Feather blades!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers and enjoy the best shave of your life!</li>
    <li> There is no reason why anyone should pay $45 for an 8 pack of Mach 3 blades. GO OLDSCHOOL!&lt;br /&gt;I bought a 10 pack of blades for $3. ROCK ON MERKUR!</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my bro-in-law.  The packaging looked a little &amp;#34;got it at the thrift stor&#x27;ish&amp;#34;, but it arrived on time and the quality of the razor appeared excellent.  It is nice and heavy compared to you regular disposable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of days later my bro-in-law called and told me it was the best shave he&#x27;d ever had.  We have similar sensitive skin issues, so I guess I&#x27;ll get one of these for myself.</li>
    <li> I had been using a Mach 3 razor and decided to try making this change to the Merker Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor (mainly to save money on the blades). I looked at reviews on Amazon as well as other sites and went with this razor. (Others may also be fine, but this is the one I decided on.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was thinking that I would cut myself and it would be a very slow shave until I got used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I found was:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt; A very pleasant shaving experience&lt;br /&gt;&gt; Only one small cut (For some reason, I usually have a few cuts when I change razors and this one small cut was less than normal. It was more of a little scratch than a cut.)&lt;br /&gt;&gt; A closer shave than with the Mach 3.&lt;br /&gt;&gt; A reasonable time to shave. From other reviews it sounded like it would be a long event. I would say it took no longer than with my Mach 3. I was being very careful at first so it took a bit longer, but once I realized I didn&#x27;t need to be so careful, it was just about the same speed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, it was a very good shave with a very small learning curve. I am very happy with the switch. With having purchased 100 blades for around $6 (I forget the exact cost). This will be MUCH less expensive than the razor I was using and a better shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: So far I have been using the aerosol shaving cream I had from before. I know this isn&#x27;t recommended and I may try shaving soap (or whatever it is people usually use), but this worked fine for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this razor to anyone. Again, I can&#x27;t compare to any other such razor, but compared to the Mach 3, it was a great change.</li>
    <li> Nice razor Good fit with feather blades</li>
    <li> I heard all the hype of going old-school and did a lot of research. I checked a bunch of videos on youtube as well as badge and badger for information. I didn&#x27;t believe it until I tried it. I ran with the Merkur blade that it came with and had the closest shave I have ever had (I believe I had about as close with the old gillette mach versions when they first came out and weren&#x27;t so cheap). This is an excellent safety razor and the quality so far seems quite good. I&#x27;ve been taking good care of it and hope it will last a long while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other FYI-&lt;br /&gt;I thought I&#x27;d need more of a learning curve but handled it like a pro the first time. It was very easy to use. I&#x27;m working on skill around the goatee as well as the sideburns but the rest is pretty much covered. I also purchased a sample pack of blades and starter set (see my other reviews). So far the Merkur was the best. Treet, Dorcy and 7am don&#x27;t seem as sharp or give as nice a shave. I&#x27;ve used the same gel(Neutrogena), brush and process for 2 shaves with each blade and working through the brands to see which is best for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just started using this and I love it. Definitely need to lather and use with finesse but I only nicked myself a few times. You hod this almost perpendicular to your skin rather than almost parralel as with conventional cartridge razors. The top of the razor is a curved, weighted piece of metal; you put this to your skin first and then adjust your angle till the blade touches your skin, which about a 45-60 degree angle. You can easily tell what&#x27;s working because one way will hurt and one will glide.</li>
    <li> Beautiful everything I had hoped for and more</li>
    <li> A work of art, the extra length in the handle is perfect for individuals with large hands. The weight of the razor is not compromised in the Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor. This is something you can pass down to your son or grandson, built to last for decades and is an all-around exceptional German made product.</li>
    <li> I just wish I&#x27;d discovered these razors LONG ago before I spent so many years buying those marketing gimmicks of multi-bladed monstrosities that don&#x27;t work as well as these with their cheap, replaceable razor blades. On a sidenote, the merkur blades are very good but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re worth the significant cost difference. I use Gillette Silver Blues and they&#x27;re very good for just have the price if you buy them in bulk, also available on Amazon. You should really experiment with different blades to find some right for you.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use. Love it.</li>
    <li> This was my first safety razor. I used it a few times  get the hang of it. Very good razor for the value. Although I wish it came with at least a 5 pack of blades. Eventually moved to the vintage gillette saftery razors though.</li>
    <li> Lost my original, this one works fine.</li>
    <li> This razors construction is very high quality; the razor is heavy and well machined.  The shave is smooth and safe, I&#x27;ve not nicked myself or had any problems since I bought it in may.  It looks so good on my counter, and I love the weight of it.  Shaving with this is a pleasure.  I wish I would have started using these safety razors years ago; it is amazing how overpriced and wasteful the plastic ones are.  I don&#x27;t think I could ever go back to disposable razors.</li>
    <li> Great product! This shave is sturdy and well make. It&#x27;s made much better than that single blade shave advertised on television. I know because I used the advertised shave until it fell apart was too soon.</li>
    <li> I am never going back to regular razors.</li>
    <li> Mostly OK, but the head too quickly starts spinning and losing the spacing adjustment.</li>
    <li> Best shave I&#x27;ve had and razor or cheep to love derby</li>
    <li> I remember when I was a kid trying my dads Gillette and walking out of the bathroom with little pieces of Toilet paper all over my face. I use this in the shower. Gives it just enough time to soften the beard.  I start at my sideburns and I think Im at the wrong angle because I dont feel anything?? Honestly, I looked at the razor because I must have foggotten the blade?? I have been using the costly 3 blade Gillettes for years and kept switching models everytime a new one came out. The blades would last about ten shaves and the little blue bar indicator turned white- so I would replace it. I have spent forty dollars for replacement blades for the last time!! I decided to go back to this razor and boy am I glad I did. Close shave and NO NICKS !!</li>
    <li> I bought this razor after I went to the store to buy replacement cartridges for a Gillette Fusion (which I had gotten for FREE after rebate), and learned that I would have to invest 38 freaking dollars to buy a package of 12. I refused on principle because I think we can all agree that this is  absolute insanity! For the same price, I bought this terrific razor that I will probably have for the rest of my life. My husband was worried that I would cut myself, but on the first try I managed to shave both legs and my underarms without a single nick. The trick is to hold the razor at a 30-degree angle, use short strokes, and absolutely no pressure. You don&#x27;t need any - the weight of the razor does all the work. Replacement blades for this razor cost about 15 cents each, and you don&#x27;t need to buy a brush, soap puck, or any other shaving accessories unless you really want to. I use regular shaving cream with great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had long been frustrated with the cost of razor cartridges, and now that my 12-year-old daughter needs them too (plus I have 2 other kids who will also have hair to remove someday), I worried that the exorbitant cost of shaving might eventually cause us to drift into financial insolvency. Problem solved.</li>
    <li> After years of being sucker punched by Gillette, my wife found this. Solid product, easy to use, and cost effective. Awesome. And there is the &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; feel...  :-)</li>
    <li> Well worth the money. I get a clean comfortable each and ever time I use it. Just wet whiskers good with hot water and rub in some Barbasol  shaving cream and your good to shave. It&#x27;s what I have been doing since 1959. I used a few different razors including a straight razor, but I always keep coming back the  double edged safety razor and this Merkur is one of the best.</li>
    <li> Beautiful razor.  Easy to use, and a good length to the handle.  Not too heavy, a good weight to the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving is simple once you get used to it, and does a good job for a fraction of the cost of regular razors.  Skin is smooth and without irritation.  A good buy, especially when paired with a matching razor stand.</li>
    <li> I picked out this safety razor for my husband at Christmas as part of a wet shaving kit I put together for him. He only shaves with this now and loves it. This is a great razor if at least to start with. It has a very solid weight to it and, to be honest, just looks nice too.</li>
    <li> Very smooth shave and a slick look.  Simple to clean and change blades.</li>
    <li> Great razor!  I previously had problems with the 4 blade disposables clogging with shave cream and hair, but have had none of those problems with this razor.  It shaves very close and has eliminated problems with ingrown hairs.  I store it in a small cup of mineral oil to just cover the head and the blades have lasted through 10 sessions with no obvious degradation in sharpness.  I&#x27;m very happy to have made the switch and look forward to saving the money on over-priced disposables.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to buy a safety razor like this without at least picking it up to feel the weight.  My dad had a Merkur that was contoured to align with the curves of your face, that thing was like a guillotine.  If you had the wrong angle as you held it the blade would skin you alive.  This razor did not disappoint, heavy enough to let the blade to the work with no added pressure, the lone handle is great for a better grip.  For all the reviewers that took the time to review this, thanks it made my choice a lot easier!</li>
    <li> Pretty safe unless you have a pimple.  The small cuts means you need more practice with small short gentle strokes.  Everyone will get them it&#x27;s just part of learning how to shave correctly.  I am also using it to clean up my eye brow which electric ones can not do</li>
    <li> I finally got sick of the expense of my Gilette Fusion Proglide. It did an alright job, but refill cartridges were driving me broke. I looked into several different safety razors before I settled on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely LOVE this razor and will never look back. This is a very high quality, weighty razor. It&#x27;s much smaller than some of the high end cartridge razors you&#x27;ll be accustom to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving with this razor will take some getting used to. All safety razors will only be affective at a certain angle. Thus, the safety part. A quality shave will only come with a good blade for your skin, a good lather, and proper technique. At first, I did have a few knicks on the skin from pressing a bit too hard. A little tip: You do not have to apply a single ounce of pressure with this razor. I hold mine with my fingertips at the very bottom of the handle, stretch my skin a bit, and you&#x27;ll be fine. With practice, I now get the best shaves of my life with this razor. No bumps, no burn, just smooth results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did have to try a few different soaps to find one that didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin. I settled on the [[ASIN:B00008X5CH Williams Mug Shaving Soap - 1.75 oz]]. Honestly, I can get this for .89 cents per puck at a local store. You also need to find a good blade that won&#x27;t irritate your skin. The Merkur one that came with the razor did not work well with me. I also tried the Wilkinson Sword brand with mixed results. The best for myself came from the [[ASIN:B004SGKMA0 Derby Extra Double Edge Razor Blades, 100 Count]] as far as performance and affordability. i&#x27;ll get a year&#x27;s worth of shaving for about $9. You will have to simply play around with these things because everyone will get different results based on your skin type. I finish everything up with a very good aftershave lotion [[ASIN:B001FB5IGE Nivea for Men Sensitive Post Shave Balm, Active Comfort System, 3.3-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 4)]] and I&#x27;m set. Zero irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, you&#x27;re paying a moderate price for an exceptional razor. I would gladly recommend and make this purchase every time.</li>
    <li> I tried shaving with this pitiful excuse for a razor. The angle leaves way too much blade exposed so plan on cutting yourself. I&#x27;ve shaved with a double edge for many years and never felt so insecure about a blade angle.&lt;br /&gt;The real gem of this razor is in the stupid twist off head. If you want to clean it because it is clogged then you have to stop mid-shave and disassemble the entire razor to clean the clog. With a butterfly design you just loosen the blade a little jiggle it under the water and it&#x27;s clean. Avoid any razor with a twist off head.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend and I both use this razor, it did take him awhile to learn how to shave with it, it is easier to get razor burn with until you learn how to use it. I love it for my legs and everything else. I also had to learn to be more careful but it works great, and there is so much less waste than those plastic disposable ones, not to mention the blades last a lot longer than the disposable ones too.</li>
    <li> I used product first time, Loved It.  Less nicks, less irritations. Grip is excellent. I typically do shaving after shower, so it causes less irritation.  I put olive oil before shaving and then do foam or brush.</li>
    <li> I love it ☺️ my first safety razor easy to use I&#x27;m really happy best shave ever</li>
    <li> This is my first safety razor, shifting over from a Gillette Fusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using this razor with Merkur disposable blades and Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Soap. I&#x27;ve got to say, this is the smoothest shave I&#x27;ve ever had. I had a few nicks when I first used this razor, but that&#x27;s mainly due to my inexperience with the shape. The razor has a heavy, sturdy feel to it, which I appreciate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mechanism for replacing blades is quite simple- twist the handle counter clockwise while holder the head of the razor, which detaches the head and the handle, where the head will separate into two separate parts, which sandwiches the blade. Simply pull the blade off the pegs, and add the new one, and rebuild. If you&#x27;ve ever played with legos, you can operate this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stainless steel finish is great, and easy to clean, and won&#x27;t rust without serious neglect. Just dry it off after every use with a towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a bit awkard to use if you&#x27;ve only used any sort of Bic or Gillette razors- the blade edge is on the side of the head of the razor, rather than the top like a Bic or Gillette, so it takes some practice. That said, I&#x27;ve never had a better or more comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> These razors don&#x27;t necessarily have a lot to them, but what there is is well made in this case. The razor has an adequate heft to it and the longer handle gives good control on the shave.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my boyfriend who wanted a close shave.  To my dismay and his this does not even shave!!  He says the blade that it came with does not come out enough to even cut!!!  I do not understand. What should I have ordered????  It is already in Costa Rica so I cannot return it unless I pay for shipping back.  DO NOT BUY THIS</li>
    <li> German stuff,  just like when I was a kid.  Works like a champ.  It is perfectly balanced,  like a good tennis racket, or fountain pen.  Use it to shave.&lt;br /&gt;;---))</li>
    <li> After a year with this razor, shudder at the thought of using a Mach III again. There&#x27;s a short learning curve, but man is it worth it. The razor itself is solid, well balanced, and feels good in the hand. It&#x27;s easy to polish to a brilliant shine. I have a stand and make sure to clean and dry all of the parts before putting it up, and I haven&#x27;t had any hints of rusting issues at all. Oh, but ditch the blade in favor of some Astra blades. They are much better, and very inexpensive.</li>
    <li> I just recently got into wetshaving thanks to the fine people at r/wickededge. This razor is well made and gives me a quality shave every time. If you&#x27;re thinking about getting into wetshaving, you could do a lot worse than this guy for a first DE blade.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t shave as close as i expected</li>
    <li> I would recommend the long handle. It&#x27;s the length of a standard disposable shaving razor. Nice weight to it. Comes with one Merkur safety razor in the package. For the price and quality it looks very high class. Close shave. Didn&#x27;t do anything special. Just watch your angle while doing it.</li>
    <li> Can not get the blade out.</li>
    <li> Merkur is a German made product which is the first hint that it is quality. They have many different models and this one is by no means their top one. Still it is a solid and simple design with a great grip on the handle and nice weight.</li>
    <li> I am SO glad I made this purchase . . the cost of Fusion Blades &amp;#34;pushed me over the top.&amp;#34;  Even though they were extremely expensive, they gave a comfortable and fast, smooth shave . . . but I simply could not justify the 5 blades for $16.00 price tag.  A friend told me he used a safety razor and I started looking into it.  Several UTube videos convinced me . . excellent instructional videos there.  After 3 or 4 shaves, you&#x27;ll determine the angle to hold the shaver, and the stroke type you like (short or long).  I&#x27;d strongly recommend you watch a couple of these UTube videos . . . If I had not, I&#x27;d have been trying to use this great razor, without a clue as to the proper technique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 65, and these last few days have been the closest, smoothest shaves I have ever had . . . I spend about 3 - 4 minutes longer, to complete my shave than with the Fusion . . however, the extra minutes are well worth it.  Guys, ya gotta try it :-)  Good luck!</li>
    <li> This is the last razor you will ever buy... Unless you buy an extra for your travel kit. This item shaves great and takes all brands of safety blades I have tried yet. Save money shave better, buy one.</li>
    <li> Great safety razor.love the long handle.</li>
    <li> Quality is all there, but husband says that it is too heavy and hard to maneuver around tight spots.  He has gone back to a lighter Gillette dual blade razor.  This razor would be better if the end of the handle rotated to remove blade.</li>
    <li> Never sure how much torque to put on the handle to tighten the blade and having to disassemble the carrier into three pieces is a pain and I&#x27;m just waiting to slice a finger... The gap between the edge of the blade and the razor makes it very hard to get right up under your nose.</li>
    <li> Gives a great shave. I&#x27;m no pro and this is great for a beginner like myself. Also, it&#x27;s weighted well.</li>
    <li> It works as advertised. Very sturdy construction. I&#x27;ve been using the razor intermittently for the past two years and it still screws together and stays tight the way it did when I first got it. The metal finish is still pristine and has no pitting or other noticeable wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with the purchase. Glad I purchased the long handle version. Considering I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that long, the normal handle would most certainly have been too short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You definitely save money with a safety razor over name brand blades if you commit to it for a few years.</li>
    <li> I used this razor, taking excellent care of it, over the past year or so.  Then one morning, the head broke right off.  I am not sure, but I believe a razor that costs this much should have a longer life.  I will not be buying any more Merkur products.</li>
    <li> No, for most seriously. It&#x27;s 6am and I&#x27;m taking the time to write up an actual review for this hunk of metal, because it is far and away the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had, with the least fuss. BUY ONE.</li>
    <li> Great value for money, I have not looked back since I replaced my old gillette system of razors and handles with this. Start slow and work on the angle, if  you use shorter strokes, you will avoid cutting yourself. I still use the old razor for some hard to get angles.</li>
    <li> Dont have anything to compare to, as this is my first safety razor. The Mekur Long handle fits perfectly in my hand and has a nice weight to it. Let the weight if the razor do all the work. I enjoy shaving in this fashion and taking my time for a nice shave. So far, much less irritation than the plastic triple/quadruple disposables.</li>
    <li> My first DE safety razor. It&#x27;s well balanced and consistently provides a great comfortable shave. You won&#x27;t go wrong buying this one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a safety razor for over 30 years - for most of that time I used a Gillette adjustable. When the Gillette butterfly mechanism got very stiff (as did the dial that controls the pitch of the blade, making it more or less aggressive) I replaced it with the only available Gillette model. The currently available Gillette is not adjustable and has a cheap plastic handle. Even in the course of three trips to Germany (where my family is from and I still have relatives and friends) I could not find a quality replacement. (As an aside, if you are ever in the Rheinland go to the Altstadt in Aachen - you can buy handmade badger hair brushes that are simply magnificent). So of course, I found the razor I wanted on Amazon. I now have two models - the Barber Pole HD (Heavy Duty) model 39c with a slant (diagonal) bar and the &amp;#34;180&amp;#34; Long Handle (shown here - aka the 23c). The 39c is gorgeous as work of craftsmanship but it requires great focus/attention to detail OR a good styptic pencil. The slant bar makes it hard to do a straight side burn line also (at least for 55-year-old bifocal eyes). As a result I use the 180/23c (the model show here) daily and I really am very fond of it. It is a traditional three piece DE (double edge or dual edge) razor - the head screws off for blade placement. Because of the simple design (as opposed to the butterfly or hinged design) and top quality Solingen steel this elegant device will last a long time. Dovo, the Merkur manufacturer, is based in the town of Solingen, in North-Rhine Wesphalia (NRW), in the D&amp;uuml;sseldorf region of the Rheinland, and they have been making razors since 1906. It shows. This razor deserves a sixth star. For $30 this is a great razor and/or a great gift. The photos shown here can not give you an idea of the weight of this razor (really nice after using a plastic Gillette safety razor) or the understated beauty of the stainless finish. This razor already feels like an old friend.</li>
    <li> Unreal. To think I&#x27;ve spent hundreds, probably more on Mach 3 then Hydro razors and blades over the years. The shave I just got with this old style safety razor was super close. Very nice. I wish I would&#x27;ve made the switch years ago. If you&#x27;re on edge about making this decision, jump. You&#x27;ll totally be happy that you did.</li>
    <li> Handles great and holds the blade solidly.  Nice close shave and easy to clean. I would recommend this to anyone interested in a single blade safety razor.</li>
    <li> this was bought for my son-in-law and he did a lot of research before having me order it, he is very pleased with it</li>
    <li> While the Gillette Fusion is great product, it is too expensive but the single blade on the backside got me thinking....Why not use a single blade to shave.  After much research and watching videos I was convinced that the Merkur 180 was rated very well and cost effective for someone dabbling their feet into shaving with a safety razor.  I have been very pleased with the quality of this razor.  I really don&#x27;t understand why people pay hundreds for a safety razor.  I&#x27;m sure that this razor will last me for many years.  I have read that others review this razor and wrote that the razor makes their shaving enjoyable.  I thought that was weird.  But I must agree.  I actually look forward to shaving.</li>
    <li> This is a good razor but not the best. I have tried several and ended up throwing this away. The handle is too long and the shape isn&#x27;t perfect. I cut my selft several times. Check out Edwin Jagger De89lbl. I abosolutely love this razor.</li>
    <li> Great DE Razor, Just started and this is my first. Clean shaves with no more irritation, razor burn, etc.  I have sensitive skin so this is perfect. 3482094 Blade razors can go in the trash now</li>
    <li> This safety razor is great for my boyfriend, but really I love it for myself. The razor&#x27;s weight and the handle length make it perfect for a woman too!</li>
    <li> My husband gets a much closer shave.</li>
    <li> This razor is very high quality and has done absolute wonders for my skin. And it&#x27;s nice that I don&#x27;t have to buy disposable razors. Well worth it. I am never turning back.</li>
    <li> This razor just shows that many of the old ways were a lot better than what we have today!  Great razor and a great shave!</li>
    <li> First time DE/ Safety Razor user here, I have a thick corse beard and also shave my head by choice. I have been using using all the 3-5 blade options all my life, spending hundreds of dollars on throw away blades. I have never had a shave this close in my life... no razor burn either. I will never go back. Give it a try you will not be disappointed</li>
    <li> Simply excellent.  I got tired of paying excessively for Gillette products and I switched to the safety razor, the type of razor I used years ago.  To my surprise, the safety razor is significantly less abrasive than brand name products.  As such, my face is not irritated after each shaving any more.  Highly recommend.  Good product.</li>
    <li> Excellent tool for those looking to go back to the good ol&#x27; days of shaving. Decently priced for this tool, but could not be happier with my purchase. I am already saving $50ish a month on those crappy five-bladed razors. Recommend every man own one of these, I will never go back to the over prices razors in the grocery store.</li>
    <li> I was a multi-blade-cartridge user for years until I met some articles in some blogs and I read about the classic wet shaving. It caught my attention and decide to take the next step and I have to say I wasn&#x27;t wrong. The shave with a safety razor, particularly with the Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor has been awesome. The materials, the craftsmanship, the weight and the feeling on hand is the best I ever felt. Seriously lads, move from those waste-razor to a safety razor, you will not regret it.</li>
    <li> Was getting used to it and then my experimentation with blade settings turned into a disaster--the top piece tumbled down my sink lost forevermore.  See my 11&amp;#34; Long Lose Pliers from Chicago Tool review for part II</li>
    <li> I cannot definitively say this is the best safety razor on the market as this is the only one I have had in a very long time. I received it as a gift and continued using it. It is well made and heavy chrome. Shaving with a safety razor is and acquired habit but it does shave very close once you learn to go slow and use several passes. I have not stepped into the domain of those who have a huge preshaving routine of oils and hots towel etc, I merely shower, lather then shave. And get a very close shave with the razor. And the cost of safety razor shaving is a plus...much cheaper.</li>
    <li> What a great shave. I really only shave every 4 days, because I&#x27;m rugged like that... razor blades last sooo much longer and are way easier to clean between strokes. Not having to deal with hair stuck in between disposable razors is a blessing. Plus it&#x27;s just plain better for the environment. And oh yeah... style factor! Your grandpa knew best folks... get the murkur model 180 safety razor. Great little razor for the money.</li>
    <li> Best thing for shaving.  It took a few shaves to get used to compared to disposable&#x27;s.  It&#x27;s angled in a way it just glides over your face and has a solid feel to it.  All the pieces come apart for cleaning and blade changes.  I bought a package of 1000 blades and have not looked back to any other way of shaving.  I can get at least a weeks worth of shaves out of this because of the double edge blades.  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s saved me tons of money on disposables.  I bought cheap blades and I still think they last longer than name brand razors.  Don&#x27;t be scared to use this it is easy to use and you will be surprised in the quality of shave you get, nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> Great product! The texture on the grip makes it easy to hold even when wet</li>
    <li> WOW!  My wife took my hints and gave me a Mercur 180 and blades as a Christmas gift.  Upon opening I was immediately impressed with the weight, look, feel, fit, and finish of the razor.  Definitely the quality that German manufacturing has become known for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dropped in a Mercur blade, warmed my face, and lathered up with regular can cream (I have some \\&quot;Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood coming tomorrow.... &#x3D;)  I did a 3-pass shave in about 10 minutes and all I can say is WOW!  Gents, you simply can&#x27;t get this baby-smooth shave with a cartridge razor or an electric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used a Gillette Sensor and Mach 3 Turbo for years.  I got so tired of the cost I bought a Braun electric last Christmas.  Forget about a close shave with the Braun, and to get the Mach 3 half as close as this Mercur I&#x27;d have to bear down deep and would still have stubble and scrapes for my trouble.  The Mercur 180 with the Mercur blades that came with it gave as close a shave I have ever had, with the exception of a barber&#x27;s straight razor.  Unbelievable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never used a double-edge razor before, but it&#x27;s a piece of cake.  For those new or unsure of the hold just look at the angle of the razor&#x27;s edge and the blade reveal and you&#x27;ll immediately figure it out.  Amazing feel of the blade cutting through my beard with no pulling, tugging, etc. that you get from a cartridge razon.  Unbelievable close (read: can&#x27;t feel any stubble!!!) and no razor burn, scrapes, or nicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sold for life.  Absolutely love it, love it, love it.  Would recommend this razor to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in the military and have to shave every day (except the weekends) and this razor just didn&#x27;t work for me. Using it every day caused a lot of skin irritation and an overall uncomfortable shave. The only time it gave a really good shave was after not shaving for at least 2 days, then the shave was the best I&#x27;d ever had. I went all out with this razor, buying quality blades, shave cream, etc. etc. Just didn&#x27;t work good for me. For now I went back to gillete as my every day shaver.</li>
    <li> I received this razor as a Christmas gift. I was pleasantly surprised by its weight; it has some heft to it. I used the razor to shave my legs and didn&#x27;t achieve the close shave I was hoping for. I probably didn&#x27;t use enough force, I admit I&#x27;m afraid of slicing my leg open so that is probably why I got the results I did.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor for my husband &amp; he is very happy with it.  He indicated that it gave him a great shave without a nick!</li>
    <li> Maybe its my relative lack of experience using one of these, but the razor feels good and heavy allowing me to get proper leverage in shaving.  the one issue for me is that I do not feel like it is as good as catching hairs when against the grain especially on a chubbier face like mine - still good though!</li>
    <li> The perfect first double edge razor!</li>
    <li> This the first time that I have used a single blade razor. I love it!!!! Mainly because I get a real good, close shave...and the blades are so much cheaper!!!! I&#x27;ll never go back to the dual blade razor!!!!</li>
    <li> its different than i thought it would be its very difficult for it to cut you and it still gives you a very close shave</li>
    <li> Short Summary:  This is my first experience with a DE safety razor and I can say without a doubt that I am never going back to disposable cartridges (In my case, the Gillette Sensor and Fusion series).  Performance and workmanship of this razor is top-notch.  Based on several other web reviews (which i also support), the 180 is a very forgiving razor and would be a perfect start to anyone just stepping into the wetshaving experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to have 3 months of usage/experience in order to give this razor an honest shakedown because I have thin, sparse, fairly slow-growing facial hair - I shave maybe once every 2 or 3 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Performance and Feel:  The 180 is very well-balanced and has a certain heft that allows the razor/blade to do all the work without you applying any pressure.  It took me a few shaves to get use to just guiding the razor where to go instead of pulling it all over my face.  In all honesty, the learning curve is very short, but take your time and you will be rewarded with an extremely close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Workmanship:  Metal plating was meticulously done and has a very high quality appearance.  After 3 months of usage, there are no signs of degradation or chipping/flaking that I read about in one of the other reviews.  I will still look out for any workmanship failures and will update this review if i encounter any.  At this moment, it looks like this razor is going to last several years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other variables that directly/indirectly impact my Merkur 180 review:  Based on several recommendations, I purchased a sampler pack of blades.  I settled on the Astra Super Premium Platinum blade due to its great performance and extremely low cost...100 blades for $10 is ridiculously unreal.  I also ditched the cheap foam/gel can stuff and went with Cremo Shave Cream.  I will admit that I face lather (not brush lathering...yet) but the smooth feel, high lubricity, and lack of post-shave skin irritation from this shave cream putsit several levels above mainstream products.</li>
    <li> All I can say for a 1st timer is WOW! Not one nick, what a smooth shave and for a rookie, was so easy. Made me wonder why anyone would ever shave any other way. The razor is a great weight and size, and the blade included is very nice. Never had a shave so smooth.</li>
    <li> I hated shaving.  Ingrown hairs, bumps, razor burn, it was an all around bad experience.  I tried all different kinds of methods and products.  I finally gave in and bought this razor, and the art of shaving starter kit.  It has changed shaving for me forever.  Shaving doesn&#x27;t hurt, and there is absolutely no after effects on my face.  This is the closest, smoothest shave I have ever had, and it really only takes a little bit more time that a plastic 3-4 blade razor.  After a little bit of experimenting my first time, I got the hang of it pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest benefit for me is that shaving no longer feels like a chore.  Something about the process of lathering up the brush and shaving with care has made it not only fun, but something I look forward to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are someone who has skin issues when you shave, give this a try, get some colonel conk, and I really think it will make the difference.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve hated my Gilette Fusion 5-blade cartidge razor for over a year now. Always left me with bumps and little knicks and ALWAYS burned. Made my upper neck look like I was thirteen and going through an intense battle with puberty. Being twenty-four, I figured it was time to stop settling for a crappy razor and go the old school route. So I bought this in December 2012.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, let me just say, oh my sweet baby Jesus, this razor is amazing! Not only does it feel sturdier, like it will last generations, but it is also very simple in its construction, consisting of just three (four including the blade) parts. No fancy technology here, just a solid, simple construction that provides a much better shave than four or five blades ever could.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be advised, however, that the use of beard oil and a lathering, moisturising shave cream are highly recommended for use with this razor. Do NOT dry shave with this razor, you and your face will regret it. Also, rather than using an alcohol-based aftershave, I heavily recommend the Every Man Jack brand post-shave face lotion. It. Is. Fan. Tastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the day though, this razor is fantastic, and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Men of Amazon, hear me!  I&#x27;m 42, have tried all kinds of razors and electrics but never a safety razor.  How foolish!  If you have never shaved with one, don&#x27;t be intimidated, I have never had a better shave and did not suffer one cut!  This is the most cost effective shave and the closest shave money can buy.  I did a lot of research before buying, it was between this and the Parker 99R and with my concern about the bombay doors on the parker ever going bad, I took this.  There is nothing to fail on this razor.  Three pieces.  Great shave!  Wonderful.  Wish I could give more stars!</li>
    <li> Feedback from my husband, who uses this product: It isn&#x27;t easy to learn how to use this kind of razor...expect to get some nicks for the first few weeks. However, the shave is extremely close and a shave lasts a long time compared to using a regular razor. It&#x27;s also great to get these benefits at a fraction of the cost of what I was spending on more traditional razors.</li>
    <li> Love this single blade shaver. Suffered through electric shavers and multi-blade BS nonsense, what a pleasure to use a single blade comfortable shave. This is a man&#x27;s razor.</li>
    <li> I have giant ape hands so getting a long handle razor is a must for me. The shaves are incredibly close with the right blades and the cost of shaving is comically low compared to cartridge razors. Love the industrial design on Merkurs in general.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used Gillette quad blades of whichever type is cheapest.  I purchased this with the &#x27;Derby extra&#x27; stainless steel blades on Amazon, and while I won&#x27;t say that you get a better shave, the first shave with a fresh blade can be just as good.  Considering how much money you&#x27;re saving, the fact that it does the job just as well is cause enough for me to switch.  If I&#x27;m careful to change out the blades regularly, which are very cheap comparatively, I get a better shave overall with less irritation.  At least in my case, the more expensive the blades, the less likely you are to change them when you should.</li>
    <li> My first double edge razor. I still have it and have had no issues with it. Its been about a year now and I shave daily. Best shave I ever had. No more Gillettes for me. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the marketing hype of 4 and 5 blades. All you need is one. The cost of the replacement blades are like 25 cents each, you will save money in the long run using a safety razor. Next safety razor I get will be heavier and shorter.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone interested in trying something new.  It has a nice weight to it and feels solid.</li>
    <li> After much hesitation, my husband and I bought this to replace disposable razors. I was so worried about getting cuts while using it to shave my legs, but that hasn&#x27;t been a problem at all! Hubby and I have both used this exclusively for over 3 months and are only on the second blade. This second one is over two months old and with no signs of getting dull (not sure what happened with the first one, which dulled very quickly). It will be quite the money-saver over the long term and is ore environmentally friendly than those disposables as well.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this safety razor. I was interested in buying a safety razor for environmental reasons, and the fact that a lot of online reviews said it gave them a closer, better and cheaper shave certainly didn&#x27;t hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t find many reviews from women/leg/underarm shaving, but I decided to chance it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the Merkur, along with a starter variety pack of blades (mine included Feather, 7 am, Derby, Shark, and Bluebird). The included Merkur blade didn&#x27;t do much for me, and I had to go through every brand in the variety pack until I found my brand, Shark. Incredibly close shave, and no irritation on underarms or legs, even in the bikini area. But because mine&#x27;s Shark doesn&#x27;t mean yours will be. It&#x27;s a satisfyingly personalized experience, and I know I can&#x27;t get anywhere near as close a shave from a conventional modern razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it&#x27;s durable! I&#x27;ve dropped this razor on porcelain and tile on several occasions. No dents or dings on the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So ladies, it takes some getting used to, figuring out the angle &amp; figuring out your blade. But once you have it down you won&#x27;t go back to those ridiculous triple &amp; quadruple bladed monstrosities, where you&#x27;re paying $4 a blade, irritating your skin, and throwing away tons of plastic every year. If the blade is good, it should be about 15 cents and you only need one of them!</li>
    <li> I love this razor. The quality, workmanship, and durability are enough to make me think i&#x27;ll never buy another razor in my life. I use this regularly, clean it after every use, and wipe it all down every time I swap out the blade. After about a year of normal use, the thing still looks like new. What other products come to mind that you can honestly say that about? Exactly. Buy this, you&#x27;ll see exactly what I mean, it&#x27;s fantastic. For the about the price of refills on some of those new fancy multi-blaze gimmick razors, you can have something of real substance that you&#x27;ll be proud to own, and that makes shaving a joy again.</li>
    <li> I was sick of crappy disposable razors.  The cost, the results, the irritation.  I did some research on double edge shaving and decided to go ahead and invest.  The initial cost was a bit concerning, but I absolutely love the investment.  I will never go back.  Go ahead and buy a good handle like this merkur, a brush/mug, a stand, something like Proraso menthol eucalyptus shaving soap, and some good blades.  I went from dreading daily shaving, to actually looking forward to, and enjoying!  You won&#x27;t regret finally saying goodbye to the multiblade crap and B.S. technology that we&#x27;ve been believing in and putting up with for decades.  Will you wait until the new \\&quot;Octablade\\&quot; or \\&quot;Pentablade\\&quot; BS marketing shows up on a T.V. commercial, to realize that what Dad/Grandpa shaved with was actually the best, and that more blades doesn&#x27;t mean a better shave.</li>
    <li> My first DE razor was a [[ASIN:B003YJ70NY Feather]] razor, which I liked very much. I bought this razor after seeing so many recommendations for it across the web and was not disappointed. The extra heft definitely gives me a better shave than the Feather, and it feels more solidly built as well. Eventually I replace this razor with the [[ASIN:B000QYEK88 Merkur 34C]]. I prefer the extra heft and have grown to like the shorter handle as well, but that is all personal preference. I still keep this razor around and use it when I&#x27;m away from home.</li>
    <li> originally i got it for myself and shaved with it once and then missed my big beard so I gifted it to my brother. He loves it as much as I did. Great shave, good weight. It feels very sturdy. He is a new recruit in the navy so this thing sees a LOT of use and holds up well.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor for a friend of mine after my father let me use his (I have an Edwin Jagger) and it&#x27;s on par with my Parker 99R and my Edwin Jagger. One of the nice things about this razor is the grip. It says firm in your hand even when coated with soap and shaving cream.</li>
    <li> I love this razor! After the initial learning curve of keeping the razor at the right angle, no more kincks and cuts. Far better than the shave I&lt;br /&gt; used to get with those cheap razors. There are more expensive DE razors out there, but for a newbie to the wet shave world, you can&#x27;t beat this razor!</li>
    <li> It has plenty of weight to easily glide across the face, and the long handle provides great control for tight areas.  I have been so impressed, I bought three more and gave them as Christmas gifts!</li>
    <li> Very happy to return to the double edge razor vice the multiple edge models currently on the market. Provides a closer shave.</li>
    <li> This is a well built razor that&#x27;s easy to handle. I like it. I&#x27;d recommend it if you&#x27;re looking for a longer handle, and the price is very reasonable. I don&#x27;t think you could buy this razor and be disappointed in it. Chances are if you use safety razors you have 4-6 of them already, and this is a good one to put into the mix.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband.  He shaves his head and face.  He cut himself up quite a bit trying to shave his head and then did a poor job of reaching all of his head.  It was okay for his face - no nicks.  He went back to his old razor.  Disappointing.</li>
    <li> I could go through a long story as to why I got this, but rather save you that pain of reading it. Just let you know this is an amazing safety razor setup with the Shark Double Edge Razor Blades.</li>
    <li> I had toyed with the idea of getting one of these for years, since I cringed when I had to buy new cartridges for my razors. After reading the reviews, I decided to jump in. The build quality is very nice. It&#x27;s got a bit of heft to it which appeals to me. It&#x27;s simple to clean. I&#x27;ve had it for a week, and not cut myself once. Follow the advice on the previous reviews, and you should be fine. The shave is similar to the cartridge-type razors that I had been using, it&#x27;ll be closer once I get used to using it and develop a shaving pattern for the shape of my face. The only unexpected thing was the fact that this is all metal and transfers heat quite well, so be sure you&#x27;re aware that you may have to turn the water on only to warm when rinsing it out and re-applying it to your face. Very hot water &#x3D; Very hot razor. My only concern right now is the availability of finding double-edge blades without having to order them online. No retail outlet sells them near my location.</li>
    <li> My 40 year old son requested this item.......AND it has proven to be every bit as close shaving as it claimed to be.</li>
    <li> I just tried this for the second time and I can say the second time around is even better!  The first time, it felt like there was some extra hairs left,  I nicked myself for the first time in a long time shaving, and my feelings were that it left much to be desired.  I didn&#x27;t shave for a few days, and then went back to it.  I lathered up real good, took it a little bit slower than the first time and the shave is just as close, if not closer - than my Mach 3.  I have no razor bumps, my skin feels smooth, and I didn&#x27;t use aftershave when I was finished.  I do however, take a shower after shaving.  I&#x27;m using one of the blades from this pack: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PZ8W5O/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o01_s01_i00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1, and I&#x27;m curious as to how the rest of them will turn out!  So far, so good.</li>
    <li> Wanted a single razor to put an end to the plastic dependency. The reviews on this razor were spot on. The razor shaves so smooth both in process and result. I have no concern of cutting myself. Also, I&#x27;ve been using the same blade for weeks so far with no indication of dulling.</li>
    <li> It works! No more buying razor refills! Woohoo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first read horror stories of reviewers nicking their faces, but I decided to watch a couple how-to videos, and these videos convinced me to get one of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it with shaving cream, but next time, I&#x27;ll try shaving without it (maybe after showering) to see if I can save money there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this product by looking up &amp;#34;sustainable shaving.&amp;#34; Interesting, right? ... My recycling center accepts stainless steel, so I could probably deposit the blades there once the blades are dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also bought the Personna Double Edge Razor Blades after inspecting a whole lotta blades on Amazon. Some reviews said other blades were super sharp and that the one that came with this one was rather dull, like my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s to hoping to save money on shaving stuff and being 0.00000001% nicer to the environment!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent razor.  It is well built and a very good quality.&lt;br /&gt;My comparison base is very small, but I have a lot of experience (about 20 years) with DE razors.  I am comparing this razor with 3 other razors I have ever had.  An open tooth comb Gillette (I think) I had a few decades ago, a cheap no brand one, and a Parker 99R.  This razor is far better than the Parker 99R, and far better than any disposable razor I have ever used.  I can get a very close shave with this one.  Actually, I think I am getting the best shaves I have ever had.  I have a coarse beard, and my shaves now last a good day and a half.&lt;br /&gt;Blades sit very evenly in the razor, and I really don’t check the alignment any more since I have not had any problems with misaligned blades.&lt;br /&gt;The razor is the perfect size and weight.  Remember that you need a very good lather, a good blade, and experience before you can get a good shave with a DE razor.  I use Wilkinson blades with this razor.&lt;br /&gt;This one works for me so well that I am going to get the Merkur open tooth 25C soon.&lt;br /&gt;Handle is 98mm (3-7/8) long, and total length is 105mm (4-3/16) long.</li>
    <li> New to double edge shaving. This is my first razor. So far no complaints from using this razor. Nice weighted feel in the hand, no rust, cleans and dries with no problems. Must say after 25 years of disposable razor blades and foam gels, I love using soap and double edge razor. My shaves have been closer, skin healthier, and pocket book fatter. Sometimes you can&#x27;t beat old school.</li>
    <li> So much safer than a straight razor and the same closeness. So much better than those multi blade razors. This is going to save me a lot of money going forward.</li>
    <li> A while ago, I found that I needed blade replacements for my Norelco electric shaver.  Blade assemblies for these can be expensive, and I had put off the purchase for a while.  In fact, I had put it off long enough that I had found a new electric shaver on sale, for less than a blade replacement kit.  So I now own two electric shavers.  Both now needing blades.  While I had used some disposables for a while, I decided to bite the bullet and purchase a completely new and fresh way (to me) of shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not regret it.  Now, the weight and size of this razor fits perfectly in my hand, and the fact that with each rinse it is clean again, makes shaving fun.  No longer do I worry about hairs filling in the gaps between each of the many blades on the disposable.  Batteries dying in my electrics that need blades anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grandpa had a good thing going for him, when he used this style of razor when he was alive.  I&#x27;m glad I eventually came to that realization as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once since I&#x27;ve only had it a day, but it is awesome.  I did a &amp;#34;side by side&amp;#34; comparison using ShavingSauce.com premium shaving oil on both sides of my face.  My wife couldn&#x27;t tell a difference on the two sides of my face one shaved by this Merkur and one by my usual multi-blade disposable.  I&#x27;ll continue this test for a week or so and then try a different blade in the Merkur.  I&#x27;m told the blade can have a big effect.  I ordered a number of different ones to try, but the supplied Merkur blade is at least as good as my existing razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is a lot heavier than the disposable so takes a little getting used to, but I think I&#x27;m going to love it!</li>
    <li> I had one of these as a kid and it brought back alot of memories. It shaved better than I remembered. It shipped to me earlier than expected so I was very happy about that.</li>
    <li> This safety razor is just the right weight and my shaving experiences with it have been excellent.  Yes it&#x27;s easier to cut yourself, but being forced to pay attention to what you do honestly results in a better shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this razor has become a pleasant part of my daily routine.</li>
    <li> this razor stik, come unset doing shaving, I,m very sorry I, broke it ,I, wish I, could  get my money back, very sorry Item... god bless you All..</li>
    <li> Just to put it simply, not at all what I expected.  I remember these from 50 years ago watching my father shave.  Not close to the old day product. I&#x27;ve tried it and will only use if the world ends.</li>
    <li> I finally took the safety razor plunge and replaced my Gillette Razor with this model and I have been happy with the switch so far.  I think I would like to mention I do shave my head with this razor and there is a bit of a learning curve doing it but it does the job.</li>
    <li> Let me start this off by saying I have extremely sensitive skin. I couldn&#x27;t even use a standard 5 blade and go with the grain without getting horrible razor burn. I was stuck to using electric razors which gave me less razor burn, but yes I still got razor burn with an electric razor. I was tired of getting horrible shaves so I googled good razors to use with my problem. Found this then thought well where am I going to find blades well amazon has got me covered with a massive selection of blades. I pulled this baby out of the box and prepped my face well I went with the grain and against the grain and wow!!! I left the stink running and could not hear the blade and thought I was doing something wrong because I felt nothing!! My face has never felt or looked this healthy!! This is a must have!!</li>
    <li> My husband LOVES his new razor...he&#x27;s pretty fussy with razors....., was in the razor/surgical instrument industry....worked very well with German manufacturers....and this rates a 5!</li>
    <li> I love it, bye bye Gillette!</li>
    <li> Simple razor that will save you a lot of money. Gives a much better shave than disposables with the proper blade. My husband says that when the time comes, we&#x27;ll get one of these for our son; very easy to use.</li>
    <li> It is very well made and the longer handle make it very user friendly. Has a very pleasant appearance.  Buy.</li>
    <li> My father last Xmas gave me a present that included shaving soap and a shaving brush.  I used it with my normal gillette razor and really liked how it felt.  I did some further research and found out how much other men really enjoyed it, plus the benefit of using an old fashioned safety razor.  Well, I bought the Merker 180 and love it.  My only suggestion though is that the blade provided by Merker is not very good.  I bought some feathers blades and it was perfect.  As a reminder from what others have said, let the razor do the work.  Don&#x27;t force it or you will cut yourself.  However, you still may get a few nicks, but the close shave is worth it. Your not going to bleed to death because of the nicks.  They heal quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I advise that you also invest in some top quality shavning soap.  I like the....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00837YY18 Proraso Shaving Soap, Eucalyptus &amp; Menthol, 5.2 oz (150 ml), New Formulation]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;or&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0007MW2ZW Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream Bowl, 5.3-Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, get a good quality shaving soap brush and your good to go.  Enjoy!</li>
    <li> I got this Merkur 180 about 2 months ago and Im very pleased. This is my first safety razor and its well worth the money. Hasnt broke or rusted. No chrome peeling off. Great product.</li>
    <li> I wonder if there&#x27;s any shaving-related problem that this razor doesn&#x27;t fix? I have thick, coarse facial hair which has always required me to shave against the grain repeatedly. You can imagine the irritation I put up with on my neck. I just shaved with this razor for the first time not ten minutes ago, and it shaved even my beard with no problem. Better still, after multiple passes in the usually-sensitive areas around my neck and jaw I felt no irritation! And without any special blades, I used the Merkur blade that came with the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Literally the best shave of my life, and absolutely zero irritation despite my quite thick facial hair. Incredible.</li>
    <li> After decades of using the multi-blade Gillette options, I thought I would try going back to the cheaper and seemingly &amp;#34;purer&amp;#34; safety razor.  From some of the reviews I expected an improvement, though I did not remember the safety razor as being that good in the first place.  I tried earnestly for some weeks, slicing my face and neck many times, and really wanted it to work I am back with my multi blades.  Sadly, there is no comparison in the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much as I don&#x27;t want to sound like a shill for the industry, the fact is that modern shaving systems are far superior and hankering for the romance of the safety razor is just that--a nostalgic reach back to a past that never existed.  While there is nothing wrong with the quality of Merkur&#x27;s manufacture, I would recommend anyone who is curious to stick with your Gillettes; they also last a LOT longer than the safety razor blades.</li>
    <li> This is a quality product, simple twist on handle, feels solid in your hand. Only negative i can think of is maybe some might thing it is soo small or short in their hand or slightly slippery because of the finish, but I think it is excellent but it is also my first/</li>
    <li> Using this has gotten rid of my acne problems now that I can change to a new blade every time I shave. It&#x27;s really important that you have to clean razor every time, and a really good topical aftershave. Exfoliating your skin and conditioning the hair to make it softer, prior to shaving, is also important. I always shave after a hot shower. Also, if you don&#x27;t drop this razor, then it won&#x27;t break. Some people are way too careless.</li>
    <li> Great, classic razor.  Be a man and put those idiotic 12-blade razors away.  Oh, this thing is nice and heavy.  You will nick yourself a couple of times (for about 2 weeks) until you get used to it.  Then, you&#x27;ll kick yourself for spending all of your money on those blade refills.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done and saves a lot of money. Don&#x27;t believe the 5 blade hype, one gets the job done if properly used.</li>
    <li> This is a great double edged shaving learning razor, which many guys never see any reason to go beyond.  I prefer the long handles and the smooth, not too aggressive head.  If you find you end up trading up, you can always turn guests and friends onto DE shaving with one of these around the house; makes a great gift for newbies; or you can always sell it on Badger &amp; Blade for 80% of what they&#x27;re currently going for.</li>
    <li> It is not that long, and not a very good feeling while shaving. I got that to replace my gillete, but it is difficult to get a good shave with this one.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Merkur razor after trying a Parker butterfly razor and an Edwin Jagger razor.  Of the ones I&#x27;ve tried previously, I like the Parker for its size, heft, and ease of use.  But I must say I really like this Merkur razor.  I find its long, pencil-thickness handle more comfortable to use and easier to adjust in my hand while shaving.  It assembles and disassembles quite easily.  I think it is well-built, and I suspect those who wrote about the screw breaking in their razor were probably trying to tighten the handle too tightly.  The handle really does not have to be tightened very tight to secure the blade.  The texture on the handle makes for a very secure grip even with wet hands, a feature lacking on the Edwin Jagger razor.  This Merkur is a razor you could safely hold in the shower if you wanted to shave while showering.  These razors need to be rinsed and dried after usage.  Those who complained about chrome peeling off the handle were probably not rinsing and drying the razor properly after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get a very good shave with this Merkur razor, and I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.  I recommend it for anyone wanting to shave with a double-edged blade.</li>
    <li> This was my first double-edge safety razor and I have loved using it.  It is easy to clean and the weight is perfect for me.</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace my Shick DE adjustable which I used for over 30 years. Found it to be very aggressive and often nicks. I replaced recently with the Parker 92R and I am very satisified with the Parker -- no nicks, close shave and EASY to clean, compared to the Merkur.</li>
    <li> Simply the best way to shave.  First, after the initial layout for the soap, razor and blades, you won&#x27;t be spending anything for a while.  About .15 cents a blade doesn&#x27;t suck for 5-7 days.  Second, the closest, most comfortable shave ever.  The shave is so close it&#x27;s hard to believe.  How does it get so close?  Who cares, it does!  Third, what a refreshing way to wake in the morning.  Nice warm shower followed by a pre-shave cream.  Lube up that lather and lovingly swirl it into your face.  Slowly, gently shave those whiskers off.  So close!!  One, maybe two passes is all you need.  Then that cold water splash followed by a nice Proraso aftershave splash.  Ready to take on the world with a great attitude.  Very pampering.  I&#x27;ll tell ya, this was probably the best change ever for me, and I&#x27;m glad I did it.  You won&#x27;t see a cartridge razor in my house again.  Enjoy the smooth!!</li>
    <li> After using cartridge style razors for so long, an all metal razor felt very heavy, but nice in the hand. It truly feels like a razor that will last forever. It did take some getting used to. You barely need to set the razor against your face to get a great shave. I started out pressing it against my skin as hard as I did with my old cartridge razor and ended up cutting myself pretty badly. Once you get used to the angle and pressure needed for a good shave you&#x27;ll never go back to cartridges again.</li>
    <li> Great razor.  Has great balance.  I am now saving lots of money instead of throwing used Mach 3 cartridges in the trash. Shave is also closer.  Just have to find a blade you like.  Have had no trouble with the handle screw.  It has not attempted to cross thread.</li>
    <li> I bought this as my first DE razor. I am quickly becoming a big fan of wet shaving. I chose this razor because I have large hands and a short handle razor felt a little strange. The razor has a good weight and a nice finish. It cleans up easily. This is a great easy razor to use for a beginner.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor to compare to my Edwin Jagger. The Merkur in terms of quality is fine, but it was a lot lighter than my EJ. I prefer the extra weight so will probably retire this razor and just stare at it in the bathroom from time to time. Now I would never try and keep someone from buying such a nice and well respected razor, I&#x27;m just saying that it was to light for me. Happy shaving!</li>
    <li> This razor is well balanced.  What I mean by that is that when shaving with it, little to no effort is required on your part to shave.  The balance of the razor &amp;#34;pivots&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;presses&amp;#34; the blade against your skin.  As long as you&#x27;ve got a quality blade (I recommend ordering a sample pack to find one for you) in it, you&#x27;ll get a great shave.  The chrome finish is somewhat frustrating, because it requires attention after use.  Leaving hard water/soap residue on the razor can cause the chrome to wear down over time.  I&#x27;m hesitant to just leave residue on there after a shave for fear the chrome layer will start to peel away.  So after every shave I end up wiping the razor down to remove the residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product says &amp;#34;long handle.&amp;#34;  However, you&#x27;ll find this razor has just about as long of a handle as a disposable Gillette or Bic.  If there&#x27;s a shorter handled version for daily use, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d like it.  This handle fits a grown man&#x27;s hand just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: If you&#x27;re looking to get a double-edged razor then try this one.  It&#x27;s reasonably priced and well manufactured.  I just wish it came with a travel case.</li>
    <li> I had used a safety razor years ago but for whatever reason I switched to the disposable ones. I finally got tired of feeling like the blade was scraping the skin off no matter how often I changed the blade and threw yet another piece of plastic into a landfill. Since switching to this safety razor I have been very happy in the shave I get with with it. I especially like the longer handle and the weight of it in my hand is very nice when my hands might get wet and soapy.</li>
    <li> I was hoping this little gem (I say little - the title says long handled but I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;d call it long) would be a little heavier. My first few shaves I was pushing a bit like I am used to with a Gilette bazillion-blade piece of plastic... I didn&#x27;t get cut or nicked, but I was hoping for more weight to drive the blade. That being said, this is a great razor! Looks very nice, super easy to use (really only cuts when your angle is correct and doesn&#x27;t touch the skin when it&#x27;s not on angle), and seems like it will hold up very well. I would have given 5 stars if only it were heavier (personal preference). I love this razor.</li>
    <li> Great razor. Second best in my shaving arsenal.</li>
    <li> This razor is an excellent 3-piece product.  It does not slip while shaving, very important.&lt;br /&gt;Also critical is that it holds a blade evenly and securely.  Most blades do well in this razor,&lt;br /&gt;but a few of the poorer ones, such as Dorco, will not.  Check the other Merkurs, as some&lt;br /&gt;have different features than this one that you may like.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor for a beginner. It&#x27;s very mild and is almost hard to screw up. Once you learn to use &amp;#34;no pressure&amp;#34; then you will not have any issue with this or any other razor.</li>
    <li> This is far better than the razors like gillette, plus I only pay $14 dollars for 100 razor blades instead of $400 dollars to get 100 razor blades. All it takes is a little practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most safety razor blades last longer too so more money saved!</li>
    <li> I received this razor today and was really worried my face would be shredded as a first time user.  Boy was I suprised perfectly smooth shave first time. All you need to do as a first time user is watch a few youtube instructional videos and shave like a pro.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend for his bday and he loves it! He gets a great shave out of it in less time than with disposables. He is excited to never buy expensive crappy razors again.</li>
    <li> I have decided to  transition from cartridges to safe razors. After researching online this safety razor had the best reviews. I didn&#x27;t want to spend too much but at the same time I wanted to buy a quality handle. So far this has been easy to use and glides pretty well.</li>
    <li> I will never leave a single blade razor ever. Except for manscaping, that&#x27;s a bit more tricky with this.</li>
    <li> as advertised I revived a model 180. it works just fine and seems really sturdy and well built. I cant shave with this razor as fast as a normal everyday throw away for much less money.!!</li>
    <li> Never going back to the overpriced prepackaged stuff by &amp;#34;big brands&amp;#34; in grocery stores. Or anywhere else. This thing will surely stand the test of time.</li>
    <li> Ok, I have ultra sensitive skin, I use some special products to shave, because anything else will give me razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;I used Gillete with multiple blades, and i got a lot of irritation and ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;I used this machine with a Merkur blade, not bad, no burn, and a good shave, but not close enough. Merkur blade are good to learn the proper technique, but better go with another blades.&lt;br /&gt;This machine is awesome, it&#x27;s simple, it&#x27;s gorgeous and works flawlessly. I was afraid of getting a lot of nicks with this, but no one so far, I can say this is a lot better that electric shaves, Gilletes or Schick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just drop all other machines, get this one, you&#x27;ll dont regret on it.</li>
    <li> At my 7th birthday party my grandfather gifted me a small jar. Inside the jar there was a small, cat sized piece of s***. I thought it was hilarious and cherished it until the day I lost it. I wouldn&#x27;t be the man I am today if he hadn&#x27;t gave me s*** for my birthday. And I sure as hell wouldn&#x27;t be manly enough to use this razor. Do yourself a favor and buy this time machine because your ass is about to be blasted back to the 1920s. Don&#x27;t be scared when you start brushing your teeth with whiskey either, that is just a side effect of using this bad ass razor. Your face will be so damn smooth, not because of the blades you use, no, because your hair will be too afraid to stand up to this terminator. The head even screws off to fix a blade and you know how much we love screwing things so that right there is a good enough selling point. Be the man you were meant to be, buy this razor.</li>
    <li> This is a good buy!! You definitely have to take your time and develop a technique.  I appear to have less irritation with this razor and double edge blades compared to the 5 blade disposables. Excellent buy in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I switched from a four blade cartridge to the Merkur safety razor.  It may take a bit more attention at first, but I get a shave that is a close as the cartridge solutions, in roughly the same amount of time, for a lot less money</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd Merkur Safety Razor and I love it. Well constructed and sturdy. Easy to load blade and the shave is magnificent.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t use any other razor.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor for my husband and he absolutely loves it and so do I!! It&#x27;s the smoothest shave he&#x27;s ever had. The blades for it are so cheap. He got a 100 for $10.00 and it has saved so much money!!!</li>
    <li> Awful razor, don&#x27;t buy</li>
    <li> Best razor I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
    <li> Great razor, long handle, a little on the heavy side, but it&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> did not meet expectations</li>
    <li> Love the feel and quality of it, but it could be a little bit heavier.</li>
    <li> This is my first safety razor and I could not be happier.  I would eventually like to progress to something with an adjustable cutting head but for now it&#x27;s simple and clean and stays looking nicer than any of my friends razors.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor! I have decided to go back to the safety razor shave because it over all is a better shave a cost effective overall! i&#x27;m so tried of the locked up multi blade razors that don&#x27;t provide a good quality smooth shave. This razor is it, a start. Get the razor, the blades and or kit to go along and satisfaction will be yours, for some a training period of shaving is needed as well as the skin!</li>
    <li> I got this razor because those Gillette Fusion razors tend to make my feel like it was being attacked. Even when I have a lot of hair on my face, it does not tug and pull on my hairs like those modern razors do. Super comfortable and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m relatively new to safety razors. I have a very thick and coarse beard, so I wish I had started using one sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Merkur is my 2nd safety razor. The first was the As Seen On TV Micro Touch Razor. The first few times I used that, I tore up my face pretty bad. I almost stopped using it. But I did notice that despite all the little nicks, I did get a very close shave. I tried slowing down, using less pressure, and the nicks got fewer and fewer, but there was always some when I used the Microtouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I started reading reviews on the top safety razors and I kept seeing glowing reviews of the Merkur. One of the complaints I kept seeing was the regular handle was really short, so I went with the long handle option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed was the difference in how to add a blade to the Merkur. The old safety razor I used had a butterfly opening, where you loosen a thumbscrew and the top opens. The Merkur is a three piece razor, where the handle screws off which allows you to remove the comb/guide and the top chrome piece. You put the blade in between the comb and the top plate holds it in place. As far as installing a blade I didn&#x27;t notice any benefit or disadvantage of this design vs the butterfly setup. However, when I shaved with the old Micro Touch, I was able to easily clean the shaving cream and hair off the blade by loosening the thumb screw a little and rinsing it under warm water. It&#x27;s not as easy to clean the blade with this three piece design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that is really the only downside to this razor. Thanks to the comb/guide, I felt like I could be a lot more aggressive with the Merkur and it seemed like with the way the razor lays on my face, it was easy to find the proper angle of attack that worked best. The Merkur has a chrome comb, and that really seems to help he blade glide over the face easier. The Micro Touch did not have this comb, so I think that is why my skin tended to get more irritated. I didn&#x27;t getany of that same irritation with the Merkur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got done, I washed off my face and walked out of the bathroom. The first thing my wife said was &amp;#34;Wow, you didn&#x27;t cut yourself&amp;#34;. I think the combination of having somewhat sensitive skin and a heavy beard, I always seemed to cut myself shaving. Whether I used the cartridge razors by Gillette or the mail order ones from Harry&#x27;s. I would get a relatively close shave, but cuts were inevitable. I got a super close shave with the Merkur, and no irritation or cuts! It was nice to be able to shave and not worry about my face stinging afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m working my way through a sample pack of blades from Feather, Shark, Dorko, and a few others. My first couple of shaves with the Merkur have been with a Lord blade. I&#x27;ll keep trying different ones to find what works best for my face and beard type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, I would not hesitate to buy this razor. It looks and feels great. It&#x27;s shiny, heavy and has a nice balance when held in the hands. I&#x27;ve only used it a few times, so I am still learning, but so far it&#x27;s worked great, even for someone like me who is relatively new to the safety razor world. I think I will continue to get better and better, especially after I experiment with a few different brands of blades.</li>
    <li> Great razor! Picked this as my first safety razor after it was recommended on a few other sites. Really simple construction and good weight make it really easy to learn how to shave, and after you learn it works like a charm. After this I&#x27;ll never go back to disposables</li>
    <li> I was pulled by all the different safety shavers to get as I recently converted to safety razors. I went with Merkur because of it&#x27;s reputation and it was a safe choice and glad I went with this brand. It looks classy and it&#x27;s cost efficient. I wouldn&#x27;t stress too much if you are about what brand to buy. It probably won&#x27;t be a big difference in the end but only the price. Go with this if you want to be safe and happy</li>
    <li> I am new to the world of DE shaving, and this safety razor seems to do the job very well.  I do not have a lot of experience with safety razors,  but after reading about other people&#x27;s experiences, I decided to give it a try.  It has changed my shaving experience from that of a chore to a pleasurable ritual.  No negatives to talk about with this razor.  It works quite well, has a good balanced feel to it, and appears that it will give faithful service for years to come.</li>
    <li> This razor is built like a truck. It has a nice weight to it. After a years use, it looks as if I just took it out of the box. This is my second one, this one is actually for a gift.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;New technology is always better.&amp;#34; It is what I thought, until I purchased the Merkur Safety Razor. I had been using the multiple-bladed disposable razors for at least two decades and thought they were the best a person could find. I mean three to five razors in one head, logically, has got to be better than just one razor but, I was so wrong. Using the Merkur Safety Razor has been the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.&lt;br /&gt;And, as far as cost goes, I&#x27;m saving lots of money with this razor. The razor by itself in comparison to any disposable razor is more expensive, but when you consider the cost of both over the same period of time then it&#x27;s actually cheaper. The razor is approximately $37 and I bought an assortment of 100 blades for an additional $25. Each blade lasts me one week shaving every day. The cost of a 5-bladed disposable head, not counting the razor itself, is approximately $1.00 per blade so, 5 heads is $25 and they also last about a week. It&#x27;s either $25 lasting you about 5 weeks or, $25 lasting you about 2 years with a whole lot better shave.&lt;br /&gt;All around I highly recommend this razor. I&#x27;m planning on buying some as gifts for friends and family. And, by the way, my soon-to-be-wife loves the close, smooth shave it gives me.</li>
    <li> I have been using this razor for about a month now and WOW.  I now know why razor companies spend Millions of dollars to advertise their $10.00  6 blade plastic junk razors.  This is the best shave that I have ever had and I&#x27;m turning 60 in a few months!  I have used a &amp;#34;mug and brush&amp;#34; for the last 30 years.  Why it took me so long to try one of the &amp;#34;old fashion&amp;#34; razors is beyond me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AND, my WIFE loves hers too!  She said that it has cut the number of times she has to shave he legs in half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get this razor, you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Best decision switching to a safety razor. Save so much money and I can say with a quality razor and good shaving cream I have a superior shaving experience when comparing to anything else. Can&#x27;t go wrong with a Merkur!</li>
    <li> I took the plunge to see what this was all about. I have shaved multiple times with the Merkur now. I have used multiple double edge razors. (to see if the razor made any difference) I have not cut myself. I followed advise on line on using the weight of the razor to have and not push into my skin. I take short stokes. I have only used one soap and the Van Der Hagen brush.&lt;br /&gt;To put things in context. I do not shave daily, probably three times a week. I am South Indian, hence, hairy! I do have a goatee, so I have to mold it each shave. I do not believe it shaves any closer than the Mac3, which I have used for years. Wife says, skin feels the same to her.&lt;br /&gt;I do like the concept of the safety razor and the prep.&lt;br /&gt;It is something different and new, but once the novelty wears off, time will tell.&lt;br /&gt;I do agree it will be much less expense over the long haul, three years by my calculation.&lt;br /&gt;Merkur is a fine handle. It is not difficult to place the blade. Although if I were to do it again, I would get one opens without coming completely unscrewed.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it performed as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ADDENDUM&lt;br /&gt;After a year now, I still prefer it to other razors.&lt;br /&gt;On travels, I use a MAC and it is just not the same.&lt;br /&gt;The whole shaving experience is better with Merkur and lathering etc.&lt;br /&gt;Doubt I will go back.</li>
    <li> Easy to take apart and put back together again.  Very durable and hasn&#x27;t been damaged yet.  Easy to hold and just the right size.  Will allow the razor to cut your facial hair while also protecting your skin from the blade.</li>
    <li> why have i been using an electric or those little plastic shavers?  safety razor and shaving cream is a great combo!  takes a minute and feels great!</li>
    <li> I have had problem with razor burn for over a decade using all the monstrosity-blade shavers.  I finally decided to make the investment into a quality razor and I saw and felt immediate benefits.  One of the best buys ever.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing razor. Simple to use. It comes with one blade and the directions are in German, but it is easy to figure out. I would buy from here again</li>
    <li> Bought this due to the reviews and the long handle. Having a fair sized hand I wanted a handle I could hold with wet hands. My only wish it would also have a thicker handle, but as I use it I have gotten better feel for holding it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No problem with mill marks and cleans easily.</li>
    <li> I will never go back to disposable razors again, great product. I&#x27;ve purchased three as gifts already!</li>
    <li> Sorry. I couldn&#x27;t get a shave out of this razor. I tried every conceivable angle and got a shave as if I&#x27;d used a two week old blade. The blades do not appear to protrude out far enough to cut the beard. I don&#x27;t have a particularly heavy beard so I was deeply disappointed. I have to think twice before I purchase another safety razor. Definitely it won&#x27;t be Merkur.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great razor and I love using it.  The heft is very nice and the fit and finish of the chrome is quite good.</li>
    <li> best razor i&#x27;ve ever used.  i put a fresh personna blade in every day.  this thing is incredible.  been using it for about a year and a half and i plan on this being a lifetime razor.  it&#x27;s very high quality.  no signs of wear at all.  shaving this way saves tons of money as well.  disposable razors cost an arm and a leg and they don&#x27;t shave well after the first use, and even the first use is quite questionable whether it&#x27;s good or not.  not the case with a merkur packing a personna blade.  baby fine shave every day.  honestly my face looks a lot younger it appears so much smoother from this shave.  very highly recommended.  just be careful.  these are not forgiving.  when you get cut, you get cut bad lol.  in no time at all though, you&#x27;ll develop a new technique that works for you and be doing speedy shaves just like your old razor.</li>
    <li> This is a piece of tech that has not changed much, if any, in the last hundred years. This particular razor uses a 3 piece design. The 2 piece head is held together by screwing the handle into the head. Nice and simple. I&#x27;ve had this razor for about a year now with no trouble or breakage, using whatever double edge blades I happen to find. Whether your looking for a cheaper alternative to cartridge systems or wanting to shave like your Grandpa did way back when, this is a good razor to use.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this razor. Very well made for a nice close shave I never thought I would find a better raxor than the Gillette saftey razor but this beats it hands down.</li>
    <li> My first DE razor. Very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s heavy, but that means its good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feels like a surgical instrument.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t feel the razor&#x27;s edge protruding between the two parts (top &amp; bottom plates) sandwiching the razor. My results when shaving is nothing near a close shave. At best it leaves a shadow. I&#x27;m holding out hope that it is my operator trouble because, my goodness, what a great feeling hardware. Sturdy and well made. I just can&#x27;t feel the blade.</li>
    <li> Perfect beginner razor.  Won&#x27;t get the baby smooth you get with an edwin jagger razor but you won&#x27;t cut yourself at all with this.  Can&#x27;t even feel it slice through the hairs but that is because it&#x27;s not aggressive.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my girlfriend - she loves it, says it&#x27;s the best razor she&#x27;s ever had.</li>
    <li> good razor but doesn&#x27;t give you the close shave that a Mach 3 razor does but its not as rough on my face as well</li>
    <li> I like this.  Has that old-timer feel and well made.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> It is nice to actually use a razor that actually shaves.</li>
    <li> I bought this on 10/31/2012 and on 11/03/2014 the screw attached to the plate broke off as I was screwing on the handle when I replaced the blade. I&#x27;ve never dropped the razor and have taken care to avoid damaging it. So it lasted only two years even though I only shave 3-4 times a week at most and replace the blade twice per week on average. Very disappointed as I bought this to save money over the Gillette Mach 3. I emailed Merkur today to see if they will replace the part.</li>
    <li> I love this, that covers it all.</li>
    <li> Nice and comfortable to hold when wet.</li>
    <li> At first, I hated it compared to the Merkur Futor, so I&#x27;m glad I gave it another chance. The knurled handle should be a standard for all double edged safety razors. After getting used to the metal comb, this has become my preferred razor.</li>
    <li> This thing changed my shaving habits. If you spend a bit of time you&#x27;ll walk away much happier, just don&#x27;t be hasty.</li>
    <li> Great price for a great quality safety razor.  I got this to replace an older safety razor, and couldn&#x27;t believe how much smoother of a shave I got with this razor.</li>
    <li> I spent about 10 days trying to get \\&quot;used\\&quot; to this shaver. No matter what I did, I could not get a close shave. That&#x27;s an understatement actually. The shave was just terrible and uneven. I spent at least 10 minutes on each attempt and every time I would have to go over and over and over and over again the same area and not get any closer. I tried two different razor blades with same result. I am surprised to see all the high marks from everyone else. I must have gotten a bad one, or maybe my skin type is so different from everyone else. I decided to give another shot to Merkur and ordered an adjustable Merkur Futur razor. My hope is that I can get a closer shave with that one since I&#x27;ll be able to adjust for a closer shave. The only upside with this razor was that I never got cut or any irritation - again, b/c the shave was not even close to being close. Definitely was not worth the money I spent on this junk. You&#x27;d be better off with a BIC razor.</li>
    <li> Amazing razor! The texture of the razor handle provides a comfortable, non-slip grip. Very easy to switch in a new blade, and still looks as great as the day I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to be aware of - if you&#x27;re running it under really hot water, this razor can heat up and also hold the heat so be careful. This piece definitely looks nicer in a bathroom a giant plastic handle razor.</li>
    <li> It is great! Have to be a bit careful... I cut myself minorly the first two times. No problems since. Skin feels way healthier since switching from Gillette.  Merkur has a great smooth shave. My problem was that i wanted to get rid of was a  shadow where moustashe is, but the only way to do this is to go against the grain, but that can cause razor burn/ingrown hairs, but every other razor has the same problem. But as for shaving with the grain it is definitly amazing.</li>
    <li> Love the razor.  Much better on my face than traditional multiple blade razor and much less expensive. It actually cuts better too.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I had heard it would be good for sensitive skin and thick hair.  I&#x27;ve tried a few times to shave only with this and never seem to get it right.  I get a few cuts but the biggest problem is breaking out on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I get to my chin and upper lip I can&#x27;t even use this, it pulls at the hair but won&#x27;t cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hope was to stop paying the crazy high prices for the special razors with batteries but it seems I&#x27;m stuck with them.  I still use this razor now and then but supplement with my Fusion or whatever it is.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent razor. Lightweight , and with good balance.&lt;br /&gt;Shaving with this razor was a very pleasant experience.</li>
    <li> The product is exactly what I was looking for.  You don&#x27;t need 2 or 6 blades to get a clean shave.  I had one when I was younger and I will never buy another Gillette or Schick ever again.  Thank you for making them reasonable in price as well.</li>
    <li> I was pretty surprised by the ease of using the razor.  I&#x27;m normally a clumsy person, and was afraid of this product initially.  Laziness was a factor also, didn&#x27;t want to use no brush or shave soap bowl.  I just bought Arko Shaving Stick to slather on face, and then shave.  A no hassle approach, and gave me the clean shave with no razor burns.  Blades are dirt cheap also, so there is no reason to switch over to a safety razor.</li>
    <li> That completely describes the shaving experience with this razor. Fine, fine, quality instrument, beautiful, highly chromed and a joy to use. Heavy enough to let the weight of it alone, glide across your face. The supplied Merkur blade worked very well, great shave, best in many years. Good bye multi blade razors, hello DE. I purchased a 30 pack of Feather blades (yellow packs) and am very disappointed with them, have ordered Astra SP to try out. I have also invested in a brush (tweezerman) and shaving soap (poraso) to fully enjoy the shave. In summation, this is a well crafted razor that I am proud to own.</li>
    <li> I should have bough this years ago. Its a better shave and cheaper than buying the over priced stuff at the drug store.</li>
    <li> Worked well for a while but 11 months later the center screw which holds the whole thing together just fell off. Until today I was satisfied . I read other reviews saying it could last a lifetime, guess again.</li>
    <li> excellent product, couldn&#x27;t be happier, made with quality and craftsmanship, the razor blades are ok though, but razor is A+.</li>
    <li> It is difficult to change the blade without cutting yourself.  The single blade cut is difficult and painful.  It is dangerous to use.</li>
    <li> I was paying $10 for 4 cartridges with my previous razor!  No more.  This Merkur is the answer.  And the quality of the Merkur shave is far superior to any cartridge razor that I&#x27;ve ever used.  The longer handle is also a plus.  The weight and design of the Merkur is outstanding.  Very little pressure is needed to get an exceptionally close shave.</li>
    <li> As a lot of people say Merkur is the Mercedes of shaving and this razor does that name justice. There is a good weight and the angle it places the blade works perfectly for me.</li>
    <li> This totally changed my outlook on shaving. I used to hate to shave always got such bad razor burn from those 5 blabe 4 blade and 3 blade face butcherers. if you haven&#x27;t shaved this way what are you waiting for? Do it now!!</li>
    <li> Quality item, the box looks beat up but the item inside it is still 100% good (the box was made of paper so it&#x27;s natural to look like that after a travel from East Coast to West Coast). This razor oozes class when you handling it on your hand, it&#x27;s built like a tank (and a lot heavier compared to normal multiblade razors).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that make me take out a star was because it was late in delivery. However I called the Amazon customer service complain and they refund my delivery fee for this item.</li>
    <li> Real close shave and cheap to use. A great alternative to spending $30 on Gillette razors that cost a lot of money to refill</li>
    <li> As someone who has only used disposable razors all my life, using a safety razor was intimidating. This model served to be a perfect replacement for the disposables, except it was much cheaper to use and delivered a much closer shave. I no longer get folliculitis from shaving and the blades are extremely easy to change. I use a regular shave gel for $3 and I am good to go. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> easy to use, nice weight to it but definitly takes some getting use to, not necessarly a fix all to standard razors but definitly a close shave with the ASTRA blades!</li>
    <li> I will continue to use this razor to reduce waste, though I don&#x27;t see any performance improvement over the high-end throw-away razors.</li>
    <li> No more expensive razor blades, that is one advantage of this razor. It shaves great and the Merkur razor blade that came with it provides a close shave. I will not go back to any of the other razors I have used.</li>
    <li> With \\&quot;regular\\&quot; razors, I always felt like I was dragging the blade over my face.  The Merkur, however, was simply gliding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has excellent weight, and feels more like a proper tool in your hands than an expensive piece of plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  Even the wife noticed and I didn&#x27;t even tell her about the purchase.  I can never go back to 2- and 3-bladed \\&quot;razors\\&quot; or disposables again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:  Once my secret was out, my wife \\&quot;borrowed\\&quot; my new razor.  She told me all her life shaving her legs made them irritated and they&#x27;d burn for days.  She&#x27;d tied every combination of razors, creams, soaps, and gels. But she had zero issues using my Merkur. She was shaking with excitement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered one of her own, and her legs have NEVER been smoother.  ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So... yeah, the Merkur would make an excellent gift for your girlfriend or wife.</li>
    <li> This is going to sound like my reviews for the shaving brush/soap and Feather blades, but here it goes.  My husband switched to this in order to save some money after having used Gillette Mach 3 blades for years.  He loves it.  The quality is great - it&#x27;s heavy duty and solid, and the replacement blades are dirt cheap.  He actually found that this method of shaving is easier on his skin as well.</li>
    <li> I bought two DE razors....a Merkur 180 and an Edwin Jagger.  While beautiful to look at and&lt;br /&gt;nostalgic, the DE razors can&#x27;t match the Gillette Fusion razor for a smooth, comfortable shave.  All the DE razors leave you with more razor burn&lt;br /&gt;and nicks and take longer to shave with. And they are hard to shave around the chin area.  So save your money.&lt;br /&gt;The big knock against the cartridge razors are the cost and the fact that they only last about two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Mine last two months.  Here&#x27;s how.  After you shave, rinse and towel dry the razor....then hit it&lt;br /&gt;with the hair dryer for about 15 seconds or so.  You see, it&#x27;s the rust that forms on the wet blades that causes&lt;br /&gt;them to go dull, rather than the shaving.  Try it and see.....it works!</li>
    <li> I recently re-discovered shaving with a double edge safety razor. This is a well-made solid razor. This particular model has a thin handle, which is hard to hold with a little arthritis. I will order one with a thicker handle, but otherwise this is an excellent choice.</li>
    <li> Because the razor was perfect, even the handle was longer than some making it easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;My husband simply loves it.......that&#x27;s what counts. My husband says it pertects his face more than other razors....but a case would be nice for travel.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband for Christmas. He is very satisfied with the performance. He said it gets close and is smooth.&lt;br /&gt;He would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This may be the last razor I ever buy. Get this, a decent brush, a box of blades, and a block of soap and you&#x27;ll be set for years.</li>
    <li> Great razor, really glad I&#x27;ve switched to this type of razor over the typical disposable four to five blade razors.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift and he loves it! The replacement blades are relatively cheap as well. Not to mention the shave is so much closer!</li>
    <li> I used it for a few months and it worked fairly well.  One day I dropped it while shaving in the shower and it broke into pieces. Cheap cast metal and not built to last. Disappointing.</li>
    <li> Great shaver, it has a nice weight to it. No more searching antique shops for me!</li>
    <li> It is a good quality razor. Very basic design. What I find though is that I am cutting myself more then with the other multi-bladed razors that you get from the store. I&#x27;m thinking that there is a learning curve using the shaver. That is why I gave it a 3 and not higher. If you are use to using a single bladed razor then you might have an easier transition then I have had.</li>
    <li> I had tried the short handle version from a friend, and decided I liked the cut, just not the short handle...So I ordered this one.</li>
    <li> Best safety razor made.</li>
    <li> I just started using a double edged razor. I must say that Merker make&#x27;s a very good razor. Has weight and gives a smooth shave. I highly recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> This is a very solid piece of shaving equipment. It is a simple but study design and works like a champ. If you&#x27;ve been shaving with a cartridge razor beware that it takes a good 30 shaves before you get used to shaving with a double edged safety (DES) razor, it&#x27;s the tuition you have to pay for the incredibly close manly shave.</li>
    <li> If your gonna &amp;#34;make the switch&amp;#34; and go old school get the replica of one of the classics I made my switch with the van der hagen safety razor and I wasn&#x27;t impressed then This beauty came in the mail and I&#x27;m sold this is the way fellow men  I got this razor and the &amp;#34;luxury&amp;#34; set from van der hagen the bowl badger brush and soap  now for this merkur  excellent is all I can say buy it!</li>
    <li> Quality razor and well balanced. Blades are easy to change and it is as good as the most expensive razors that cost an arm and a leg. The blades are fairly inexpensive but do a great job.</li>
    <li> I usually do not write comment.  However, this razor really impresses me.  I was skeptical about the cut, safety issue of this blade.  Surprisingly not at all.  I used Gillette sensor and fusion over 10 years.  I was thinking to change to mach 3.  But the prize in the long run is really high (even you buy a bulk in costco).  that&#x27;s why I choose this razor blade.&lt;br /&gt;About this product, it is better to have a long handled.  the long handle can help you on shaving.  The major difference that i feel between Gillette and double edge razor blade is Gillette razor is safer even if you apply excessive force on the face.  Double edge type razor needs a little bit care to prevent the cut (so far I used 5 times without any cut).  Just let the weight of the razor to do the job.  If you feel the razor stop to move forward, don&#x27;t rush to get the job done.  Try different angle and you will be fine.&lt;br /&gt;So far I am really satisfied with this razor.  Trust me, you won&#x27;t go back to those disposable razor once you start to use this razor.  And the &amp;#34;cut&amp;#34; is not as easy as you see in the movie.  With a little bit care, you will be fine.</li>
    <li> First off, this razor is rock solid and good construction. A little pricey, but it should last a very long time. I have seen no issues with rusting or chrome peeling off. Those other reviewers who had problems with chrome peeling off likely got a fake, my thoughts at least. Anyway, it took me about 4-5 shaves to get the hang of this thing. If you&#x27;re new to using a safety razor, I learned that the best thing to do is apply soft pressure and really take your time. You&#x27;ll need to make several passes. But, you do get a very close shave, although it takes a little more time. Don&#x27;t rush it, I cannot stress that enough. I&#x27;m using the Derby razors and they work great. My only gripe is that it&#x27;s a little tough to get right up under my nose with the design this razor, but other than that no complaints.</li>
    <li> Quality razor with great weight.  I got this with the Van Der Hagen luxury set on Amazon.  The razor holds the heat from the water well and provides the best shave.  I get a super smooth shave in three passes.  if that seems like a waste of your time try it once or twice, you&#x27;ll appreciate how it makes you pay attention, slow down, and enjoy the process.  Spend the money and the time on yourself, you will not regret it.</li>
    <li> best shave I&#x27;ve had in a while. also it definitely beats out the cost of replacing those blades with those other brands. save money and get a good shave.</li>
    <li> It works well, but I had to buy this (my second) in a few months shy of 2 years because the screw broke out.  They say not to over screw it, but it is important to note that the integrity of the screw attachment is very poor.</li>
    <li> Learn how your father shave get this.</li>
    <li> Great and easy to use. High recommend.</li>
    <li> Just as ordered, excellent styling!</li>
    <li> Feels like your shaving with a tool.  Leave the plastic razors behind.  Been using it about three months, best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> I got this as my first safety razor after using a five-blade cartridge razor all my life. Maybe I came in with too high of expectations, but so far it isn&#x27;t quite what I expected. The blades are easy to change but, the shave is not nearly as close as I feel it should be. After about a week of using this razor, I still have to go over my entire face twice and my face still isn&#x27;t as well shaved as I would like. The only promise this razor has lived up to is a severe drop in irritation. I have very sensitive skin that was always bothered by my former razor. I have noticed very little irritation since using this. I just need a razor that can completely shave my entire face more efficiently.</li>
    <li> Saves money and works great</li>
    <li> I will never buy another razor ever again. This safety razor is all you&#x27;ll ever need.</li>
    <li> Great razor! I love the way it feels and its sturdy construction. Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it. I get a great shave with it and actually look forward to shaving with it. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Solid, high quality and durable.</li>
    <li> Best shave ever! Unbelievable.. Also buy the proraso shave soap, escali brush and Wilkinson blades... The perfect kit! Bye bye disposable razors, never use disposable again..</li>
    <li> I grew up with single edge and then double edge safety razors, but like many others I was drawn to the multiple blade products which do give a closer shave. Problem is that the multiple blade refills are more expensive. The problem I started having was with ingrown hairs with the closer shave. I decided to give this razor a try and could not be more pleased. It is well made, sturdy, and the blade refills are inexpensive. What&#x27;s more, no more problems with ingrown hairs. The long handle is really not that long, but adequate for my very large hands. Highly recommended and shipping was prompt.</li>
    <li> Throw away your disposable razors and cheap plastic nonsense. This is the way to go.</li>
    <li> Fantastic quality, fine German crafstmanship that has revolutionized my shave. Expect to use this for many more years. HIGHLY recommend!</li>
    <li> Not sure what I am doing wrong, but disposable double gillete  do a better job. This sh*t hurts when shaving.</li>
    <li> This is my first safety razor after a lifetime of using cheap disposables.  Kind of glides itself down the face while cutting - absolutely no tug on the whiskers - just cuts them.  I would follow the advise of going slowly.  Doing one pass, then re-applying shaving cream and doing a second pass leaves an extremely close shave.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only cut myself when in a hurry trying to sprint it across my face like a disposable.  This razor allows for zero lateral movement back and forth without cutting. If the stroke goes side to side instead of up/down, you will likely cut yourself and know about it until five minutes later.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using Personna brand blades, which are awesome - much better than the Merkur blade this ships with.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving four instead of five stars because after several weeks, I am seeing signs of rust on the inside of the threaded barrel. No rust on any of the parts that actually are visible but touch my face, but I would like it to be completely non-oxidized.</li>
    <li> Good, solid-feeling razor, both in hand and against the skin. Provides just as close a shave as any of the cartridge razors I&#x27;ve used, and the replacement razors are a tiny fraction of the cost of the cartridges run.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my boyfriend. He has used the gillette safety razor in the past but had switched to the disposable razor, mach 3. This razor is of high quality. He likes the long handle. He has no problem using the razor or changing the blades.  He can shave just as quickly with this razor as the mach 3 and no nicks or cuts. Blades last longer and shave closer than the mach 3. I purchases the 100 pack of Gillette blades here on amazon. Purchasing this razor is saving us lots of money and the shave is much better</li>
    <li> German engineering!  Very well made, medium on the aggressiveness of blade exposer and well worth the price.  I have used this razor for about a month and have no complaints, good entry level shaver that will last a life time.</li>
    <li> Best grooming move I made. No longer buying those expensive cartridges with laughable amounts of blades that clog after every pass. I can rip through a lot of hair on my face with this then simply twist it loose and the hair falls right out. No more banging a razor on the sink to clean it up. Good balance.</li>
    <li> This was a huge dissapointment. I ordered this as a christmas gift to my husband. For a new item on prime, it arrived with the box open at the top. Unable to close again. The ends were worn down so bad it looked terrible. Didn&#x27;t look new at all. When I handed him the beat up box, I said here it can&#x27;t be a gift so have it, my husband opens it up fully to find the razor was bent in half. So a brand new razor I ordered close to 30 bucks, arrived in POOR condition. I won&#x27;t be returning it. We will order the blades and carry on. Because we won&#x27;t be bothered with any more christmas drama. It should have been a wonderful gift. No one else had issues. And my husband laughed at the razors &amp;#34;larger handle&amp;#34;. He said wow this is large? What&#x27;s small then? Three stars for amazon prime for mailing us out tattered garbage packaging and a broken blade. The actual product is fine. I believe the reviews. Prime really messed up.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent, well built razor! Merkur is a very well established company and you can trust the name. Five stars!</li>
    <li> You have to disassemble to put in a new blade, not what I would consider safe by any means. I suspect that some razor cuts on the fingers are likely. I returned mine straight away. The design of the old safety razors provide a knob at the base of the handle that could be turned to open the blade carriage.</li>
    <li> Excellent build quality.  Worth every cent.</li>
    <li> Good product,  very solid razor but prefer my Edwin Jagger</li>
    <li> My first safety blade razor, coming from the Gillette 5 blade world. I got this one because I was used to the longer handles on the Gillettes and have large hands. If I could go back, I would have gotten the short handle version because it would be lighter and more agile. The build quality is incredible. I highly recommend these Merkurs.</li>
    <li> I finally switched to double-edge razors and I wish I had known about them much sooner. This razor has a good weight and helps just slide down the face. Great product for the money and already recommended it to other people. Would definitely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this product 5 stars is the price.  I don&#x27;t know how much it could possibly cost to produce something as simple in design as this.  This seems pricey.  That said, it works great as a DE razor, holds the blade tightly without distortion, and cleans up easily.  Does seem to transfer heat fairly efficiently to the handle, so if you like to shave in scalding hot water (I do not), you may burn your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is better than the 7 dollar plastic razor available on here.  I started with that one.  That one works, but does not hold the blade as well and is not near as solid.</li>
    <li> With only one cut from shaving improperly, this razor works great.  I followed the guide lines set up by \\&quot;The Art of Shaving\\&quot; and I&#x27;m getting a great shave.  I&#x27;m also saving so much from not having to buy all of those disposable cartridges.</li>
    <li> I made the switch from cartridge razors and am not disappointed at all. get this and the below linked razors and save some money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B004SGKMA0 Derby Extra Double Edge Razor Blades, 100 Count]]</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to wetshaving, and started with this razor due to the favorable reviews here on amazon. I don&#x27;t regret that at all, because this is a very good starting razor. It is easy to use, and as long as you don&#x27;t go against the grain of your facial hair, you&#x27;ll have no more nicks or cuts than you would from shaving with an ordinary cartridge razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, there are a few important details for those who, like me, are new to wetshaving. First, razors such as these are more dangerous than regular cartridge razors, so you should not push down on it while shaving. Instead, you should use a light touch and let gravity pull the razor down along your skin. The more force you apply, the greater the chances you&#x27;ll cut yourself. Second, with this razor you have to take your time, and keep it properly angled against your face. The correct angle is in about a 30 to 40 degree range. If the angle is too close to 90, you&#x27;ll cut your face more. If it&#x27;s too close to 0, you won&#x27;t be cutting any facial hair at all. Therefore control and patience are needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, as I said, even a beginner like me could shave with this razor with very few cuts, and the shave it provides is easily comparable to one from a cartridge razor. This razor also comes with a single double sided razor blade, which should last about 2 weeks of daily use. Beyond that, you&#x27;ll need to purchase new razor blades, but fortunately they are ridiculously cheap when compared to what cartridges sell for. I would recommend getting a sampler pack from amazon or elsewhere on the internet with a variety of different brands of razor, as they are all different, and some may provide a more comfortable shave than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, as this is a metal razor, it conducts heat from hot running water very well, so if you run the water on a very hot setting, you may burn yourself. However, I never let it get that hot, and actually find the sensation of the warm razor running down my face very enjoyable. Overall, I much prefer this method of shaving to cartridge razors, as my skin has less irritation now than ever before, and is actually clearer than ever. I highly recommend that everyone give wetshaving a try.erall, I much prefer this method of shaving to cartridge razors, as my skin has less irritation now than ever before, and is actually clearer than ever. I highly recommend that everyone give wetshaving a try.</li>
    <li> I have no issues with this razor whatsoever. The handle is an excellent size, which makes me wonder what a shorter handle would feel like. Maybe I just have large hands.</li>
    <li> The razor works and works well.  Solid construction and easy to dismantle to get a new razor in.  Repeated uses will dull the chrome, but that&#x27;s just a cleaning away from sparkling chrome again.</li>
    <li> Today I had my very first safety razor shave with this beauty. I have been using cartridges for years and always had irritation and ingrown hair. I started using a shavette a few weeks ago and noticed  that both have vanished completely. while slowly getting myself into straight razor shaving I ordered this to try it out as well. One of my best purchases ever. Even with the Merkur blade that came with it (which aren&#x27;t known to be the sharpest) I am extremely impressed with the shave i got. Buy one and your face will thank you. I have heard they are great for the ladies as well.</li>
    <li> This razor is excellent. I bought one for me and one for my girlfriend. She shaves her legs and womanly area with it and tells me it has made a big difference in irritation with shaving down there. Safety razors are where its at.</li>
    <li> If your skin is very sensitive, you should really try to go the oldschool way and use a merkur. Been using it for almost 2 years, my suffering ended</li>
    <li> The heft of the razor makes it a lot easier to shave compared to lighter safety razors. It&#x27;s a well-made product with quality details.</li>
    <li> As a guy who has fast growing facial hair, I always hated shaving. I&#x27;ve used all the disposable razors, expensive Mach 4 style razors, and cheap bic disposables. This razor however has made me love shaving. Having the exposed corner of the razor makes precision of your shave lines really easy. The blades are sharp, but without enough exposed to accidentally cut yourself. Cleaning them up takes less than a minute. The old-fashioned style of the razor makes it look much nicer in your bathroom than that plastic junk. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I am new to using a Safety Razor but after using this one I will never go back to the modern razors.</li>
    <li> A friend suggested I try this razor, and it works great. I watched a couple of youtube videos to get the shaving technique down, Paying $.10 / blade is much better than $2 / blade. The only thing you have to be careful about its taking it through airport security. The blades are not allowed.</li>
    <li> I am part Arab- ergo I am a hairy guy; like Chewbacca hairy. I shave on a daily basis, sometimes twice a day for formal events in the evening. Spending so much time on hair maintenance you think I would know a thing or two about shaving and shaving products.&lt;br /&gt;After spending a fortune on fancy Mach 8.368 razor blades I decided there must be a better way. Because I still haven’t gotten my hands on a lightsaber to shave with I decided the next best thing would be a true old school shave. I’ve tried both straight razor and double edge. There are a few things I’ve learned about the shaving methods.&lt;br /&gt;1. Straight Razor saving is a lot like being a Samurai. It sounds cool, but that sword is dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;2. Modern razors are expensive and are not interchangeable. I ended up wasting so much money I would try and stretch the use of the cartages – my face suffered from my attempts to be frugal.&lt;br /&gt;3. Don’t underestimate a good shave soap.&lt;br /&gt;So my double edge (DE) Razor of choice was a Merker for balance and stability. A few notes about the razor. You need a sharp blade. The standard blades are interchangeable and you need to try a few before finding what suits you best. I switch between bluebird and feather because I have a very thick hair growth. The actual Merker razor is heavy enough to keep stable in your hand, and is roughly the same size as your standard Mach 8.3. There is also a shorter heaver version, but I found it slightly clumsy in my hand. The last thing I want is a slip when passing a razor across my jugular.&lt;br /&gt;For those of you looking into getting into DE shaving, the Merker 180 is a great first razor, and a great razor by any measure. Its balance and quality build make it my primary razor. I don’t shave with a DE razor on a daily basis because it takes longer to get a super close shave (about 15 min) and I don’t need to because its so freggin’  close. Buy this, it’s a good investment if you’re serious about the shave.</li>
    <li> Bought this razor to try out safety razor shaving and ill never go back to spending all the money on cartridge shaving. A much better shave and a lot cheaper. I wish I would have done this a lot sooner. This seems like the easiest razor to shave with and it looks good</li>
    <li> After shaving for over 55 yrs, I say this unit nicks, consumes time cleaning while in use, and does only a marginal job at shaving my beard.</li>
    <li> First DE razor and so far no nicks cuts or gashes.  Very easy to shave with.  Not an aggressive razor.  I do not have a heavy beard and works better than my previous disposable razors &amp;#34;Gillette&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> My brother bought a Merkur Model 180 a couple months back and let me shave with it using a &#x27;Feather&#x27; brand blade.  (AMAZING).  Afterwards I had ZERO of the usual &#x27;bumps&#x27; or &#x27;ingrown hairs that my 3 Blade Gillette normally gave me.  I was sold and immediately ordered one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the razor today at 1:32 pm and did a fresh shave at 1:35.  So far, I&#x27;m very pleased.  Although the included &#x27;Merkur&#x27; blade doesn&#x27;t feel as efficient as the &#x27;Feather&#x27; it still left me with a clean bump free shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this razor, and please do some research on youtube about shaving with a straight razor before ordering.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my husband and he loves it. wishes he had it sooner.</li>
    <li> Excellent workmanship  everything is crap I am thinking of obtaining other products.you just  can&#x27;t  find good shaving tools that make a you feel  like you got  a good close shave thank you</li>
    <li> just a great quality I will never go back to the &#x27;new&#x27; style razors just impeccable</li>
    <li> Be a real man with this fine product.</li>
    <li> The razor itself is nice and easy to hold.  A bit awkward changing blades, but that could just be me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all the reading I have done on these safety razors and how great they are suppose to be, I was a little disappointed in how much longer it took to get a close shave; probably double the amount of time it took with a double bladed disposable.  Perhaps it is the blade type I am using (Personna [I do like the fact they are American. made]) so I have to experiment with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was actually afraid to use it at first as I didn&#x27;t want to rip my face apart, but I found it almost impossinble to do that unless you run the blade in a direction like you were slicing something, then you will cut yourself!</li>
    <li> First time using a safety razor and it is an easy to use three piece razor, perfect weight and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what my son wanted for Christmas, I ordered it later in the season but delivery was prompt.&lt;br /&gt;He is happy and therefore so am I,</li>
    <li> This is a well made razor.  Yes, it is a little heavy but you can get used to it.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I purchased a cheap $13 safety razor from Sally&#x27;s and was curious about the quality jump from that to the merkur. I was impressed by the build, as well as the quality of the shave!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike the cheap razor, this was very sturdy, and heavy. It is hollow down the center of the pole, but is still very heavy. The head isn&#x27;t a butterfly closure, but it is very easy and just as safe to put on and off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In considering the shave, it is definitely a less aggressive shave, but reinforces for beginners like be that safety razors are meant for hair reduction! Not removal! Three or more passes haven&#x27;t lead to irritation for me at all, and has a more even and closer shave than the fusion pro glide (manual proglide) that I use only for emergency shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are planning on diving into the world of wet shaving, this is an amazing product to start, or even end with!</li>
    <li> I really like this shaver but you just have to be careful not to push down and just let the weight of the razor do the job.  I learned the hard way when I cut myself shaving my legs.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few years now.  The razor has a great weight and works really well.  The quality of the shave mostly depends on the blades but most of them work great. The only real issue is the ability to cut yourself deep if you are in a hurry or not paying attention.  The most important thing is to go slow and replace the blades as things get dull.</li>
    <li> Bought this as an anniversary gift for my husband. He loves it! His only complaint is that he wishes it was a little longer. This combined with the taylor of old bond street sandlewood shave cream has cured his ingrowns, and gives him the best shave he has ever had. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> THE BEST razor anyone can buy! I Love the size of the handle too. I still had one of the old one, no comparability. This one i do not cut myself, like with the old one. I am a female that loves this razor! The blades are so cheap to buy. I too have tried different blades to see which i like best. so far i liked Schick. Highly recommend it that is why i give it five stars</li>
    <li> I have several of the butterfly type safety razors and they work good. This one seems to stay closed and does not loosen up like the butterfly design.  I love all of my razors, but the fit, finish and design makes this an outstanding value and something every man who has to shave should own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this razor, a good brush, lathering shave cream in the tube, and some blades along with a bottle of that barbershop aftershave.  Then spend some time shaving like your father did when you were a kid. You won&#x27;t regret it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soak a few wash clothes in hot water to pat your face down after the shave, and just enjoy the moment. Look in the mirror and make believe you&#x27;re 20 years younger. R&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put on some of that plastic bottle aftershave, which I love and my wife really doesn&#x27;t care for, and you&#x27;ll feel like you&#x27;ve gotten into a time travel machine when men went to the barbershop to be....  Let&#x27;s just say, men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is nostalgia in a modern age of disposable. You&#x27;ll have this razor and one day, your kids will find this and discover a lost art.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you&#x27;re older, place it in a box with your favorite pocket knife, a pair of your finest hand stitched shoes, a cashmere sweater and sox and a good bottle of wine. Make sure to sprinkle with a few pictures of them and you during your younger years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When your children open it, they&#x27;ll understand that simple things make life what it is, or at least what it should be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You decide....</li>
    <li> great price and quick delivery</li>
    <li> it was a gift and he liked it a lot</li>
    <li> This is my first safety razor and I can say for certain that my Mach days are over.  The milling and finish aren&#x27;t those of some of the more expensive razors I&#x27;ve researched, yet the tolerances are still exact.  The blade seated perfectly and the performance was light years beyond any disposable I&#x27;ve ever used.  Again, I&#x27;m a safety razor newb, so maybe this is typical.  But if I did have a criticism, it would be the sharp corners of the &amp;#34;blade saddle,&amp;#34; making it hard to navigate around the nose and ears without scratches.  With time, perhaps I&#x27;ll learn the tricks of the trade.  In the meantime, I foresee many years of use due to the heft and solid quality of this model and have no problem saying goodbye to the expense of disposable razors and c</li>
    <li> Makes for a very close shave.  Holds the blades in just the right angle to get a nice cut.  I knocked it down a star for two reasons.  1) I still find changing blades very awkward compared to the butterfly style safety razors.  It might be just me.  2) With the guards just outside of the blade, it can be a little difficult to rinse the junk off the blade if you don&#x27;t have enough water pressure.  I generally only have trouble with this in hotels.  Overall, a very good razor.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift for my husband because disposable razors don&#x27;t cut it (no pun intended) and to buy replacement blades for the trac II razors, you need to take out a second mortgage.  He gets the close shave he likes and one blade services a few shaves.&lt;br /&gt;Makes a nice gift.</li>
    <li> My first safety razor.  Very easy to use.  Very high quality construction.  Affordable.  Simply put, a great buy that I will get use out of for years to come.</li>
    <li> I have somewhat big hands, so the longer handle is great for me. The three pieces of the razor are substantial and weighty, clearly reflecting the quality construction Merkur puts into their razors. Changing blades is very easy. Would recommend as a first razor to a beginner or even a backup/travel razor for the regular user.</li>
    <li> Merkur safety razor gives an outstanding shave. With the guard it is nearly impossible to  nick one&#x27;s self. No razor burn nor post shave discomfort. Using a safety razor, one is not adding plastic razor handles or razor heads to trash pickups. The thin razor blade breaks down much more quickly; thus, it is a greener choice. I use a shaving brush and shaving soap in a mug.</li>
    <li> In many ways, this reminds me of the Gillette razor that I had when I was younger. But it is even nicer that what I remember. Combined with Wilkinson Sword blades, this is much less expense than the new stuff that I was using from the grocery store. And, as a plus, I get a better result from shaving. I especially like that I can actually _clean_ the blade between uses, unlike the &amp;#34;all in one&amp;#34; which just get clogged with detritus (shaving cream &amp; beard hair) which I cannot clean out.</li>
    <li> Good DE handle. A little different than the conventional DE, but works fine all the same.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s something about the liberated feeling I get every time i see this razor...  Gone are the days of paying $14 for a new &amp;#34;Gillette Mach 3 titan amazing&amp;#34; with only 1 backup cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I literally bought a 40 pack of blades and haven&#x27;t spent a dime on anything shaving related for the last 6 months...(except for shaving cream)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every time i got to a friends house and see a dull prefabricated clunky plastic shaving device with 5 BLADES.. i shake my head in shame..  if only he knew better.</li>
    <li> Simply great! Can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve waited so long to switch to a double edge safety razor! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Great product! Takes some getting used to. It&#x27;s all about the blade. You&#x27;ll save a lot of money by investing in one of these  UPDATE 1/11/2016 Been 4 years and I&#x27;m still using this! It&#x27;s a great razer. I&#x27;ve saved probably saved a lot of money.</li>
    <li> Watching a few YouTube videos and on the Art of Manliness to learn how to use a safety razor and with a little practice, I&#x27;ve come to enjoy shaving. The Mekur is incredibly well made and will last a lifetime. I&#x27;m exploring different replacement blades to find the perfect one for me. I&#x27;m incredibly pleased!!!!</li>
    <li> It takes some practice to use but you probably know that. I wish it was a little easier to travel with. Oh also if you shave your head be SUPER CAREFUL if you start using this one. I&#x27;ve been shaving with it for a year now but still tend to shave with a cartridge razor from dollar shave club.</li>
    <li> First off I&#x27;m a black male with coarse hair and if you&#x27;re the same you can relate with hairs growing any and everyway but straight down... I&#x27;ve used a 5 blade razor for a while and this beats it hands down. My engrown hairs have went from many to about 5 per shave which is good considering my hair type. seems like the more I use it the less I get which is a plus.. I would suggest anyone who have the same hair type to purchase along with the art of shaving kit. So if you&#x27;re looking for a classy and purposeful razor this is it.</li>
    <li> I did a good bit of research before I purchased the 180 Long Handle and kept coming back to this one.  This is buy far the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used and once you get your technique down you will have the best shaves of your life.  The long handle is particularly useful for someone that has larger hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will never use a cartridge razor again...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just because there is new technology out there, doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s better.</li>
    <li> I am new to safety razors, did some research and found the merkur 180 was popular. Excellent shave (even enjoyable). Trying out different blade brands now.</li>
    <li> Hubby LOVES it and he&#x27;s a 25+ year Gillette Mach user.  He pairs it with the Arbonne shaving gel for a great and painless result.</li>
    <li> It is impossible to find a quality razor for ladies.  So, I bought this and am using it to shave my legs and underarms.  It is definitely a quality razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because the head is so bulky I thought it might be tedious to shave with, but obviously Merkur knows what they&#x27;re doing and the shave is as close as any you&#x27;ll find with your Venus or Bic razors.  Now, the shave didn&#x27;t pick up everything on the first swipe--sometimes I&#x27;d have to go back over an area again (never more than three times) to get at the hair.  But again, this is nothing different from even the nicest ladies razors on the market, which aren&#x27;t nearly as chic looking as this nor will the razors last as long or be as economical (a 10 pack of replacement blades for this product on Amazon will set you back $9 and last twice as long as the $25 you&#x27;d spend for a 10 pack of replacement heads for a lady&#x27;s razor).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product comes with one Merkur blade, which seems plenty sharp.  I&#x27;ve also heard good things about Feather blades, so I&#x27;m trying those next to see if that makes for an even better shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note, my boyfriend tried this razor out when I bought it and now he wants one.  Definitely a good purchase!</li>
    <li> STOP using a disposible razor.  You are wasting SO much money on blades.  Not only is this a much cheaper solution but it&#x27;s better.  It&#x27;s very heavy (in a good way), the razors are very cheap and last a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides all that the is the best shave you&#x27;ll ever have.</li>
    <li> Again, another product purchased for my deployed husband. This razor was to replace the high end name brand razor that he normally uses, and now he will never go back to those high priced razors and blades that do not last nearly long enough. The quality of the Merkur Model 180 is in fact superior to many others that have been reviewed prior to purchase. So far, it has proven to be very durable... easy to clean, no hassle, and easily stored in a small spot (including slipping into a pocket if necessary for when one is on the go and in a hurry).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My father had a safety razor similar to this when I was a little girl, and I was happy to find one for my husband. Not only is it a money saver due to the durability of the razor itself, but the use of the double edged blades saves money as well; with the *leading name brand* razor blades found in local department stores costing upwards of $25+ for only four blades. This razor coupled with the double edged blades provides a superior close shave, and leaves ones face as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom. Wish I&#x27;d have found this for hubby a lot sooner.</li>
    <li> Sometimes you have to take a step back and get away from all the multi blade hype non sense .</li>
    <li> The razor is just that a dual edge single blade. It takes some getting used to if you shave with disposable razors. Mostly because you have to guide the blade to the right angle it does not flex there on its own like the razors of today. But once you find the angle that works the razor is a dream. In single passes you can get the hair that it takes new razors 3-4 passes to get. This is because new razors have plastic guides that have a built in all purpose angle, but does not get as close to the skin as the &amp;#34;safety razor&amp;#34;. It requires more effort from you the user, but that effort is rewarded with a close, smooth and relatively quick shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Prep Work is Everything:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  A clean face is always required but people skip it. A hot shower and a washed face makes everything easier and In my experience results in less irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Soap is key and a good shave brush. To thin and the soap just drips off, to thick and the soap gets clogged in the razor. Again its one of those things that takes work but once you get the hang of it things work really well. The soap I use has a cooling effect that is a good balance to a rinse in hot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Art of Angle and Pressure:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The razor works best at a 30 degree angle (approximate depending on your face) and you have to experiment with going down, up and even sideways to see what gets your facial hair best. As for pressure I find that weight alone is not enough to get a close shave, BUT medium to heavy pressure rapid passes will be sure to cut you because it is a razor blade after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Difference between a Nick and a Cut:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  There are a fair amount of people that say its a horrible shave and they cut themselves allot. I would refer them to Pressure and angle because to much of those is the only way cuts can happen. But a cut is of a fair size, bleeds allot and really stings. A nick on the other hand is something you don&#x27;t even notice until you spot a tiny little red dot that you can fox with a tiny piece of toilet paper. For me they occur on the neck because I have not quite mastered the angle because my neck hair grows every Whitch way. But its no big deal because I will master it eventually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aftershave: its really a must because a good aftersave prevents irritation and possible razor burn chances even more. Many aftershaves have a good smell and some even moisture effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Only bad thing I can say is the Chrome is rubbing off the razor after 2 shaves and that is the only reason for a 4 star and not a 5. Prep work, a learning curve and aftershave are not cons. Because they are implied by it being an older style of razor.</li>
    <li> I have three razors right now and this is my go-to razor.  Not too agressive--never have cut myself with it.  Great craftsmanship.  Especially beginners should start with this razor-- it will give a more than close enough shave without too much irritation or cuts or nicks.  Forget the vintage razors, 1904, slants etc.  Start with the Merkur 180 Long Handle and I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Bought this item for my husband. He has horrible razor bumps and ingrown hairs when he shaves. With this razor his bumps and ingrown hairs have almost completely vanished. I would recommend this razor if you have either one of those problems! He LOVES his!</li>
    <li> Bought this for Christmas and I am glad I did. This is a substantial razor nice feel it is hefty I am a big guy so I like the weight. The directions are a bit vague and I was assembling incorrectly if it does not give you a close shave reassemble it. Razor only goes together one of 2 ways. I absolutely love the shave I am getting with this razor.</li>
    <li> I have always used Gilette 4 blade replacable head razors. This thing is amazing, closer shave, little to no pulling while I am shaving. Had it for 3 months and I will never go back. What on earth do we use disposable razors for when these work so much better. I have thick facial hair, and always shave in the shower to soften it up first, this is a close shave with no burn. Awesome product!!</li>
    <li> Its a solid strong shaver. I takes a little longer to shave but its close. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Very cool looking razor and easy to use.  There are some other razors I&#x27;ve seen where the design makes it easier to replace the blade.  Great deal for the price.</li>
    <li> Great Price. Fast Shipping. Item as Described...</li>
    <li> Very well made and easy to change the blades; I gave it an honest effort for a month and just couldn&#x27;t get used to the single blade. It has a tendency to nick and cut if you don&#x27;t take a lot of time and caution. Leaves a lot of stubble if you try to shave too fast.</li>
    <li> Great first safety razor for someone who hasn&#x27;t tried this kind of shaving before.</li>
    <li> I remember my father and grandfather using these while growing up and when I started shaving I thought I would hurt myself using one so I never tried it.  I recently found a topic on while visiting a forum and having Double-Edge razors being recommended over the 2,3,4,5,6 blade variables, I decided to research it and I&#x27;m glad that I did and I am fully converted over after my first shave.  The closeness of the shave beats my Gilette Fusion, and for the price of the handle + blades it can&#x27;t be beat.  For the price of 8-12 Fusion cartridges that would last a few months, I was able to purchase this + 100 blades that will last me more than a year!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to shave:  check out videos online.  It&#x27;s a slightly different method where you need to put the handle parallel to the floor, then angle it down until the blade comes in contact with your beard/skin, then in short strokes you start shaving.  People complaining about getting cut must be doing something wrong, either using long strokes or rushing.  My first shave, and a few since then, I haven&#x27;t cut or nicked myself.  The key is to take your time and short strokes while rinsing the blade out frequently.  I also use a shaving brush with a shaving soap in a mug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchase the long handle which is fine, but after using it, I see where you may want to get the short one instead.  The razor is top heavy, and that&#x27;s exactly what you want.  It&#x27;s hard to explain to someone who hasn&#x27;t used it, but you want the weight of the razor to shave, not your hand pulling on the handle.  The handle is there to act as a guide, if I was to get it again I would go with the short razor version.  You don&#x27;t need to grab onto it for it to work, only a few fingers with a light touch will do the job.  The handle itself is great too, when wet, I still have full control and grip on it, and it doesn&#x27;t feel slippery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s made in Germany and I would rate the craftsmanship at about 4.8 out of 5.  It&#x27;s a great razor, and if you&#x27;re looking to get into D.E. shaving, I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price of blades, (100 for $30-$50) you essentially have 200 razors (double-sided) for the price of $0.15~$0.25 a shave, you have a fresh blade each and every time.  A box would last you about a year depending on how often you shave.  I would recommend trying a sampler pack as not all blades are the same.  The one Merkur one that comes with it (they can afford to give you 5) was excellent.  I think I will purchase the Merkur after my Astra&#x27;s are done as it was a much closer shave.  Check out other users pictures that they&#x27;ve uploaded for the construction and pieces of how it is assembled/disassembled.</li>
    <li> So this is a bit old school but works for me and over time much less expensive than the alternatives.  I bought the Italian shaving cream, that helps over the gel type shave creams.  I get 3 to 4 shaves per blade.  No nicks or cuts yet, I got that with the expensive razors too.  It works for me, the quality of product is good.</li>
    <li> I have been using a Mercer safety razor for 2 years now. I use a pre-shave oil and a badger hair brush and shave cream. I love it. I have grown very accustomed of what to expect. I have cut myself (ad I have with cartridges also) but its tiny (no Sweeny Todd scene)and is always because I&#x27;m rushing it. If you change your razors often enough and take your time you will be fine and you will have a wonderfully close shave. The cartridges are for our rushed lifestyle really...  that&#x27;s it. Or at least that&#x27;s my take. Professional barbers either use a safety razor of this sort or a strait razor and they get professional results. Its worked great for me also.</li>
    <li> Incredibly smooth, I could not believe the difference between a cheap razor and this Merkur even with the same blade, this gives an amazingly unaggressive shave.  The long handle works for me and adds a bit of weight which I like.</li>
    <li> Purchased this last year but forgot to write a review......I absolutely love it!!! Works great, looks great, shaves great!! I would recommend this razor to anyone!</li>
    <li> Best thing I ever did for my face was start using a DE razor. I use to get very bad razor bumps and now that I use this razor, Taylor of old Bond street shave cream and TEND skin after shaving I barely get bumps anymore. I also use the feather razor which is by far the best for me. People compliment me on how nice skin looks now.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Heavy duty and looks like it will last&lt;br /&gt;Looks good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Expensive&lt;br /&gt;Inelegant means of changing blades&lt;br /&gt;No blade adjustment&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: I might have bought something else.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and I because I was sick of paying so much for razors. The investment is well worth the close shave and saving a ton of money on blades. takes a min to adjust from a modern razor but well worth the learning curve.</li>
    <li> Very impressed.  Quality workmanship</li>
    <li> This one is pure beauty--amazing construction, not surprising from Germany.  Got it for Dad and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  This baby will last several lifetimes.</li>
    <li> It was pretty good, the blades it comes with weren&#x27;t super special but it&#x27;s not bad. Very easy to use</li>
    <li> Worked great till the top busted off when I was tightening it after replacing the blade about eight months after I bought it.</li>
    <li> This razor is absolutely fabulous.  I ordered another brand prior to this and cut my face every morning.  This razor is an incredibly well made precision shaving instrument that makes shaving a pleasure.  Shipped without instructions but you can find them online easily enough.  If you are planning to change to a safety razor, this is the one to start with.  The longer handle makes it easier and more comfortable to shave.  Your face will thank you!!!</li>
    <li> There are many extensive reviews already posted, so I am just going to say as a first time user of this razor, I will never go back to a disposable again. This thing is smooth, easy to use, well balanced, and cheap by comparison.</li>
    <li> Requires greater care than disposables.  Thus, I try to shave when not rushing.  Appreciate closer shave</li>
    <li> I get the best shaves with this than any others!</li>
    <li> bought this as a valentines present for my boyfriend. he has really enjoyed learning to use it and mastering the art.</li>
    <li> This is only a 2 inch handle at best. Way too small. Other than that works great just too short. Maybe they sent me the wrong one, I never did check the model numbers.</li>
    <li> It seems like they got the safety razor right about, I don&#x27;t know, a hundred years ago, and all we needed to do was keep using that. Turns out we didn&#x27;t need five blades, we only needed half of one since you&#x27;ll use one side at a time. It pays for itself pretty quickly, but you probably will need to shave in the shower to keep the hair soft.</li>
    <li> The quality of Merkur products is top notch, and this razor is nothing less than that. Because of its long handle and its engraving, I am able to handle the razor with a lot of precision.</li>
    <li> Yes even though this razor gives you a very close shave I cannot for the life of me have one shaving session where I do not completely butcher my entire face. I end up bleeding in about 5 separate spots everytime I shave. So maybe it is my fault and not the razors but I have been practicing for about two months now and still cannot seem to get it just right. Also in the few times that I do get it right my whole face is red, scratchy, itchy, and basically meets all the criteria for razor burn, what is the solution for this? I am giving this razor 3 stars because it is mostly my fault for not knowing how to use it but perhaps they could have somehow made it more user friendly or just a little bit gentler..</li>
    <li> This item arrived quickly and was everything I was looking for; clean, efficient, sturdy, and good price. Recommended for all looking to get a good shave and have a nice addition to the bath room.</li>
    <li> I love all things vintage, but...this just doesn&#x27;t shave as well as my gillette mach 3.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s Gillette&#x27;s multiple blades or the moisture strips...but the Merkur safety razor gave me a pretty bad razor burn, also.</li>
    <li> Excelent razor. The size and the quality are greats. Very convenience for the prize. I reccomend this razor to every men.</li>
    <li> Once again I took Jack Passion&#x27;s advice and am very pleased with the result. The Merkur 180 is very popular with those new to wet-shaving. The reason is probably because most books or articles mention the Merkur 180 as a good starting razor for those new to wet-shaving.</li>
    <li> Stop being a savage, stop sharing your blade with your wife&#x27;s legs...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grow up, buy a Merkur, and treat yourself like you should.  Every shave has now become an intimate engagement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before you shave up, check out a youtube how to video.. You won&#x27;t cut yourself unless you&#x27;re a klutz.</li>
    <li> German engineers are really amazing, capable of producing a high quality motorway like the autobahn and all the sophisticated technology to travel it at speed and in safety, and also of producing seemingly simple mass consumer goods that are well designed, durable, properly engineered for fit and comfort, and pleasing to look at. The Merkur 180 is one such product that I really enjoy using and am becoming fonder of it as time goes on. This isn&#x27;t my first long handled double edge razor, nor my first Merkur, but it is my first Merkur long handled razor. I still overall prefer the short handled Merkur in my cabinet probably because I am used to its heft and feel over long use. The Merkur 180 is a solid, well-made object that can easily survive a few drops to the floor while continuing to provide great shaves over many years. I would highly recommend this product to both beginning and experienced DE razor users if they want to try a long handled safety razor they&#x27;ll keep for decades.</li>
    <li> It takes some practice, but I have been happy that I switched to this style of razor. I have never had much luck with cartage razors and have been using a small electric razor which I really like but obviously doesn&#x27;t give a super close shave and I look silly with stubble. I have been using a shaving brush (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003WR3QSG/) and soap then a brush cream. I generally need to do two passes plus a third pass for my chin and lower lip region, so it takes a bit longer but I have been shaving off time as I get better with it. If I really don&#x27;t feel like wetting my face I can use my old electric razor and that will do for the day, but I do notice the difference between that and using this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From my experience, it&#x27;s a good option from someone just getting into brush and single-blade shaving. This guy has a lot of great videos to get you started, I recommend watching the first handful he uploaded: [...]</li>
    <li> I got tired of paying ridiculous amounts for razor cartridges for my Schick Hydro 5.  4 blades were upwards of $18 when they were on sale!  I started looking at alliterative and that is when I learned about wet shaving with double edge safety razors.  I did extensive research on different brands and models and finally decided to try the Merkur 180.  I have been very pleased with the results.  Since the first shave I could tell that I was going to be hooked.  It does take a couple of weeks to let your face become fully adjusted to any new type of razor so don&#x27;t give up after the first couple of times.  I found that the Astra razors worked best for me and a box of 100 was $9.82 making each blade just under $0.10!!  I get a super close shave and I love being able to switch blades without feeling guilty because of the price.  My 100 pack should last me at least a year because I only shave a few times a week.</li>
    <li> It arrived as scheduled and it was just what I wanted.... The complimentary blade was a bonus to start with! I&#x27;m sure my husband would be thrilled to have this traditional shaver!</li>
    <li> For a cost of $45, I have a great razor and enough blades to last me two years. It&#x27;s old school, stylish, and incredibly frugal. Win win win.</li>
    <li> Very nice razor that shaves on the mild side.  Not aggressive but works better with feather blades for me.</li>
    <li> Love it. Astra and Feather brand are the blades I use with this. Shave like the old school pros used to do. Topple the USSR, date Maralyn Monroe,  learn to sail...and get away from the cheesey cartridge razors. Save some money too. Impress your friends. Try a razor brand that&#x27;ll work for you and your new Merkur Razor. Buy it!</li>
    <li> My son loves this razor.  It&#x27;s the closest shave he has ever had.</li>
    <li> Ordered this razor with a 30 pack or Bic platinum razors. This razor gave me the best shave I have had in a long time. Almost a close of a shave as one can get from a barber shape. I have since trashed my Gillette razor along and will never buy over priced blades again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard of stupid conspiracies like Hallmark created valentines day and candy companies created trick-or-treating on Halloween to sell more of their product but here&#x27;s a new one I&#x27;m actually believing; razor blade companies like Gillette and Schick are hiding safety razors and blades to sell more of their new crap. The reason I say this is because i&#x27;ve tried every razor and blade out their and by far the best one is a safety razor that people used 100 years ago. I&#x27;ve been shaving since I was 15 because I have very light skin but thick black hair so I have to shave all the time or ill have an ugly beard in 3 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also a word of advise if you want a great shaving cream try using &amp;#34;Shave Secret&amp;#34; they sell it at Wal-Mart for $2-3, it lasts 2 months, and there&#x27;s no razor burn after.</li>
    <li> After 6 months of daily use with astra platinum blades I&#x27;m greatly satisfied with it.  You just need to get used to using this type of razor.  I also microwave a towel before I shave for an improvised hot towel which helps with irritation during the winter.</li>
    <li> Great razor very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I like this Merkur razor.  It&#x27;s a great looking piece of shaving equipment and I&#x27;m glad I gave it a try.  I have found that I don&#x27;t like it as well as a lot of the other reviewers but I don&#x27;t attribute that to any design or construction weaknesses.  I think it comes down to personal preferences and, from what I&#x27;ve read here, the \\&quot;aggressiveness\\&quot; of one brand compared to another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried many different safety razors and judging by these reviews the art of shaving seems to be a passion for some guys.  That&#x27;s great and I appreciate they&#x27;ve taken the time to share their expertise.  As for me, my safety razor experience came about when I ended up my granddad&#x27;s old Gillette Super-Speed Flare-Tip razor.  I decided to clean it up and gave it a try and found a great article on how to recondition old safety razors on a site called \\&quot;artofmanliness\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This old Gillette has a shorter handle and a \\&quot;twist-to-open\\&quot; top that makes replacing blades a quick and friendly process.  The mass is well distributed between the handle and the head and even though it is short I found it to have a nice balance and that it was easy to use.  When I tried it my first impression was that I had forgotten to put a blade in it.  I could feel the head, but not the razor.  When I could see clean shaven skin, I knew I was doing something right.  I took to it immediately and found using it intuitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In contrast, I knew right away I had a blade in this Merkur and found that I had to exercise much more caution to prevent nicks and razor burn.  After several shaves I began to grow accustomed to the longer handle and finding the right angle, etc.  I think it&#x27;s a process men (and women who use this) probably have to go through as they try any new safety razor.  I tried a few different types of blades and found the ones that seemed to work best for my face/beard and eventually grew comfortable with this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if I were to pick which of the razors give me the better shave experience, I have to go with the vintage Gillette.  I know that there are probably Merkur enthusiasts here who would attribute this to user error on my part and that very well may be the case.  But I find the \\&quot;less aggressive\\&quot; design of the vintage Gillette much more to my liking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I tried this Merkur and will probably still use it from time-to-time.  My only advice I guess is for guys who try this model as their first safety razor experience.  I think that if I had bought and tried this without having had any other experience (albeit little) with safety razors it wouldn&#x27;t have gotten much use after the new wore off.  So if you&#x27;re trying this Merkur as your first safety razor and don&#x27;t take to it, consider trying a different style/brand of safety razor before you give up on them.  In the end it&#x27;s just like deciding if you like Schick over Gillette or the Mach 4 over the Fusion, etc.  Each razor and blade has its own characteristics and you&#x27;re not going to know which ones work best in your situation until you&#x27;ve tried a few., I have to go with the vintage Gillette.

    <li> Typical Merkur high quality. Feels good in my hand. Purchasers should check on length of the handle before they buy. The 4 is perfect for me, and I&#x27;m a small guy. The handle on the short handled Merkur razor is too shrt.</li>
    <li> Simple and easy to use.  Ironically, the handle was shorter than I thought it would be since it is advertised as &amp;#34;long handled.&amp;#34;  However, it is long enough for anyone to use.</li>
    <li> Tried a Safety Razor with plastic in it prior to this one... obviously was not happy. This one cost more...but is worth the extra $. The extra weight gives a more solid shave. Still looking for best most complementary blades. Happy searching!</li>
    <li> Not inpresedan at all , however it does work . I think underror 20 bucks is the most it&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> I sprung for this two and half years ago after I had been duped into buying a super mach fusion extreme whatever razor, and saw the price of the refill cartridges. This, plus 100 Astra Razor blades and I&#x27;ve never looked back.  This thing looks great and is of solid construction. Changing the blades is a piece of cake.  I usually clean it and dry it after use, but I haven&#x27;t seen any deterioration or rust. Do yourself a favor and get this, plus the Astra blades, and some Proraso shaving soap. It actually makes shaving fun!</li>
    <li> Once the proper technique is acquired, which takes about 2 or 3 shaves if you read up on how to do it, this is way better (and way cheaper) than the crazy 5 blade cartridges. I don&#x27;t have big hands but this Merkur has a nice length, weight, and feel for me. Great, close shaves.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty good at removing hair from my face. What is everyone so excited about? No need to get all philosophically.</li>
    <li> AWESOME! Worth every penny for the best shave you can get. Save a lot of money on blades over the long haul</li>
    <li> Love it. This is my second safety razor. After I experimented with a cheaper one, I invested in this and absolutely love it. It helps that I&#x27;ve cut my razor bill by more than 75% since I shave every day. Well constructed, solid grip and well balanced.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for a while now and it&#x27;s just as good, if not better than the disposables I&#x27;ve used all my life. It&#x27;s a little slower to use and you have to relearn how to shave, but I do like it. It&#x27;s also a lot cheaper in buying blades for it.</li>
    <li> This razor provides a close shave and a more economic option than tradition disposable razors. It took me some getting used to but once I got the hang of it I found that I enjoy it much more than the other options I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> My legs have never been so smooth!</li>
    <li> This is my first DE razor handle, and I couldn&#x27;t have started with a better product.  Unfortunately, I wasted my first 30+ years of shaving, and loads of money, using multi-blade garbage.  I&#x27;ll never look back.  Or, if I look back, it will only be to mock my stupid younger self.  Take the time to learn good no-pressure shaving technique, and find a blade that works for you, and you&#x27;ll get the best shaves of your life for very, very little money.  For my money, Dorco 301 blades are the best - check out my review of that product: http://www.amazon.com/review/R17U481QW0EKDO/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_pr_perm?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;ASIN&#x3D;B001MJSAJQ&amp;linkCode&#x3D;&amp;nodeID&#x3D;&amp;tag&#x3D;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, for comparison, I would classify my beard as tough to very tough, and I need to shave in the afternoon as well as the morning if I want to look my best for a dinner or something. I use a Merkur 180, Williams shave soap and an Escali badger brush. No prep products or creams or lotions. My only shave prep is a hot shower and letting the shave soap soak on my face for a minute or so before shaving.</li>
    <li> This is my fifth Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor - that&#x27;s how much I recommend them. I bought my first one about 4 years ago, and it served me exceptionally well. Until I dropped it from about 6 feet up. The head snapped at the screw mount, so I bought a replacement. The other three were gifts, and have gotten lots of praise and compliments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I left mine at a relative&#x27;s house, I was pretty sad. We see them every few months, but I could&#x27;t wait - so I asked them to mail it to me. That&#x27;s how much I missed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the long handle. It makes it much easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+ Good price for the durability and high quality&lt;br /&gt;+ Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;+ Classic good goods&lt;br /&gt;+ Reduces ingrown hair significantly&lt;br /&gt;+ Double edge razors are cheap&lt;br /&gt;+ Double edge razors can be found anywhere in the world (Europ, Asia, Australia, USA)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- None&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you are new to double edge safety razors - don&#x27;t worry. It takes a while to get used to (you have to go slow at first), but it&#x27;ll give you a close shave. One of the big benefits of a single blade double edge safety razor: it reduces ingrown hair, bumps, and pimples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to go fancy, also pick up a badger hair brush and Proraso shaving cream. Of course, you don&#x27;t need all that. A can of Barbasol works just fine too. Previously, I used Proraso with a badger hair brush, but now I switched to soap or Barbasol because it&#x27;s more convenient to shave while I shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also - if you are traveling, do not travel with the razor blade. Although I&#x27;ve accidentally done that a few times and never been stopped by TSA, I think it&#x27;s safer to avoid being hassled by packing your double edge safety razors in your check-in.</li>
    <li> This razor is awesome!!!! I get an extremely close shave at 1/3 the cost of using my gillete fusion.  It took a couple days to get use to at first.  I love the product and would recommend it to anyone for close shave!!!1</li>
    <li> I am new at this shaving traditionally with the soap kit, but I won&#x27;t go back to the old razors that can be bought from the shelf. It takes a little more time than normal to get a great shave, but I do feel wonderful afterwards. Sometimes I have cut myself; however, I have to slow down because it uses feather blades, or I just have to replace the blade (and not be cheap). I have owned this for a month now, it hasn&#x27;t chipped on me, and this blade isn&#x27;t a sore sight in the bathroom for those who like a little class (or a wife lol).</li>
    <li> I just switched to safety razors, and started with a very inexpensive brand and model to test it out. I liked the other, but after 4 months I twisted a little too hard and the head came off! Maybe I don&#x27;t know my own strength but that struck me as odd as you have to get the razors in for it to wrk. Anyway, I went with the Merkur and the reviews are obviously correct. The razor is made out of heavy steel and is apparent that the quality is excellent. It works great and I have no doubt it will last for years.</li>
    <li> Personally, I think this is the best safety razor on the planet. I have two of them. The only rival, in my opinion, would be the Edwin Jagger safety razor, also an excellent razor but I prefer the longer handle available on the Merkur. Merkur blades are about as good as they get as well. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is a good strong system but I think the safety fender hinders you from getting a good close shave. I ma at a point where I am trying to break off the safety fenders but its difficult because its so strong, so I end up taking it out and sandwiching the blade between the main part and the stick. This allows for a more clean and precise shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However it is more dangerous since the blade is not held stiff. Trying to screw the stick in more to hold the blade stiff, resulted in the blade spinning in my hands and nicked my finger, which bled profusely. The irony!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What would make this the perfect shaving tool is optional/ removable safety.</li>
    <li> Have used this safety razor for 7+ months. Has a nice heavy feel. Works great. While the razor does not like the super hard water of Arizona, it has not impacted its effectiveness one bit. Would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> Very good product and paired with a good razor blade provides a good close shave.&lt;br /&gt;It is well built overall but be careful not to drop it on a hard surface as the top plate screw can break after repeated drops.&lt;br /&gt;Customer service is excellent though. They stand behind their product.</li>
    <li> My beard grows out FAST and this set up keep me from having to shave twice a day which is great</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 26 years old and I&#x27;ve always used Mach razors.  They irritated my face extremely bad even while using the sensitive skin shaving cream.  I&#x27;m talking REALLY BAD, broke out every time I used those razors even once new out of the package.  I decided to take a look on amazon and consider a new approach.  I came across this razor and was hesitant because of it being an older style ( I remember my grandfather using one like this lol).  The first time I used it I nicked myself twice pretty good with the blade that came with it but no irritation !  It even shaved closer than the Mach razors I had previously been using.  I ended up buying 50 Feather blades for it and also Proraso sensitive skin soap and Proraso sensitive skin aftershave.  No irritation and no cutting myself either after these additions.  Just a bit of advice and tips: Buy a Badger Brush for applying the soap, let the weight of the razor do the work while shaving and feel out the contour of your skin, also it is handy to buy a stand to hold the razor and brush, and coating the razor in baby oil will help keep it lubricated and protected from air.  In all I love this razor !</li>
    <li> This is a great razor, I was tired of the crummy shaves I was getting from multiblade razors and I saw the great reviews for this product and thought I&#x27;d try it out. I was not disappointed! This remarkably simplistic design WORKS. Try it! You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> I can shave three passes with this with little to no skin irritation or ingrown hairs.  It also provides a close shave, especially when pared with Feather blades.  Much cheaper cost to own when compared to cartridge shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love using old timey brush and shaving soap too.  I have owned this shaver for the past four months and I am not looking back!  Do yourself a favor and give double edge shaving a try.</li>
    <li> it does not open as easily as the short handle version does. You also have to grab it by the head in order to open or close it.</li>
    <li> I Have been using disposable Gillettes for years. Just bought this Merkur after doing some research. After one shave I wish I had switched 10 years ago.</li>
    <li> I had been hesitant to buy one of these as I remember cutting myself often with these types of razors before. Not so with this one, plus it gives a nice, clean shave, all for a lot cheaper in the long run than buying expensive cartridges or adding to landfill waste by buying disposable plastic ones. I highly recommend this one.</li>
    <li> Best shave I have ever had when used with Feather blades. Saves tons of money compared to disposable razors - has already paid for itself.</li>
    <li> Was only used to mach 1000&#x27;s or whatever number they&#x27;re at. Don&#x27;t get me wrong they worked great but sooooo expensive and annoying to get. Now all I need are blades and I get crazy close shaves but I always end up bleeding somewhere since my technique isn&#x27;t great yet</li>
    <li> just like old times. save money and get a better shave</li>
    <li> Good weight and feel. I wish it was a bit longer though. Overall I think most people will like this shaver and it looks like it will last through an ice age.</li>
    <li> I always used cartridge razors and after switching to this DE razor I will not be switching back.  It does take some getting used to and I still haven&#x27;t mastered shaving with it but on my &#x27;bad&#x27; shaves with this razor it is still better than my &#x27;good&#x27; shaves with cartridge razors.  I can&#x27;t compare this razor to other brands or models as I&#x27;ve had no experience with them.  But I can say this has been a great first DE razor for me and I currently feel no need to switch to another one.  I like the knurling and the chrome finish.  I&#x27;ve noticed what might be a few weak spots in the finish that might eventually rust but they also aren&#x27;t so bad that this is guaranteed to happen.  The handle length is just fine for someone coming from cartridge razors and the weight is also comfortable and reassuring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are wondering about trying DE shaving, I would recommend spending the $30~ to try it out.  I&#x27;ve found it to be worth the initial investment.</li>
    <li> I made the switch, and I do not realize why we ever switched. The longer handle is great and gives a good balance and the setup if very conducive to beginners. If you can shave with a cartridge razor, you can shave with this. Just take your time. Initial investment seems high, but pays for itself within a year.</li>
    <li> well after a lot of contemplating I finally pulled the trigger and bought the Merkur SR.&lt;br /&gt;Works great. I don&#x27;t think I will ever go back to the Gilettes again.&lt;br /&gt;Now for those of you who have been contemplating my advise is don&#x27;t :&lt;br /&gt;It is a great way to shave. Feels good. Does not give any irritation. After the initial investment in the razor/badger brush/soap the blades are much cheaper. Also the quality of the shave is much better. You won&#x27;t get such close shave with the safety rajzors.&lt;br /&gt;The learning curve to an average IQ guy should not be more than a week. I just cut myself once ( the 1st day) and never again in the 3 months plus I have been using it. So you will be just fine.&lt;br /&gt;The only negative if you can say that is it does take time. So set aside some extra time and I know you with practice you can do it much faster.</li>
    <li> German made, so it cuts well of course! lol although it feels like a standard length to me not sure about the &amp;#34;long handle&amp;#34; part.</li>
    <li> So far it has exceeded expectations. It has a great weight and feel in the hand. I enjoy the warming feeling on my face due to the fact that it&#x27;s made of metal.</li>
    <li> Decided to replace my electric after it went through yet another twenty dollar blade cartridge.  Got this, the Van der Hagen Luxury Shave set, and Feather blades.  Feels good in the hand, heavy and sturdy compared to a disposable or cartridge, and the blades were cheap and sharp if changed weekly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a learning period of about a week, everything was going great and I was on track to have a great shave for about fifty to start and twenty a year after that.  It would go great for you, too, though I would have started with different blades if I started over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless that is you end up playing around with a bunch of different brushes, soaps, razors, blades, aftershaves, etc.  If you don&#x27;t get sucked into the experimentation and acquisition vortex you&#x27;ll be better off for it, or richer for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of which, a budget shaver might consider a weishi or parker, as they are cheaper and give about the same result if you don&#x27;t turn shaving into a Zen ritual.</li>
    <li> A couple of years ago I got tired of throwing away one plastic disposable razor after another and decided to try a safety razor. I bought the blades with the best review, but went with a cheap razor \\&quot;to give it a try.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well... I tried and tried... and tried. And cut myself over and over again and scraped my face raw. So I went out and got some razor blades for a name-brand handle that the company had sent to me a while back. I was floored to discover how expensive tri-blade razors are. As the package was about to run out, I came back to Amazon and looked hard at the reviews of the saftey razors that I had deemed too expensive the first time. I settled on the Merkur and it arrived yesterday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today I tried it for the first time and I was bowled over. I have been having to shave twice to get a close shave for over 25 years, but today the first time over was nearly enough. This is probably the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had. I&#x27;ll come back and update this review as time passes and I get more experience, but I will tell you... I wasted my money on the cheap model I tried first, plus on the pricey 3-blade cartridges. I have really high hopes now!</li>
    <li> Bought this a few months ago and am in love. Goodbye expensive and inferior 3 and 5 bladed cartridges. Hello to the best shave of my life.</li>
    <li> After years of shaving with the expensive multi-blade Mach-Fusion things, I wanted to get back to basics. This razor is the perfect way to start using a double edge. It&#x27;s well balanced. Sturdy. And gives a superb shave. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple of weeks, but it was easy to get used to. It&#x27;s like second nature. Get yourself a good badger brush and some quality shaving soap and you are set.</li>
    <li> My research reveals that Merkur is the razor of choice for many folks. I bought the long handled one because I wasn&#x27;t sure what to buy. I think it was less expensive than the regular length. I don&#x27;t think it matters what length you buy. It&#x27;s sturdy, and does its job. Can&#x27;t ask for more. I&#x27;d buy it again. I&#x27;m glad I switched to double edge razors, from the cartridge razors that I used for over fifty years. The process takes longer, but I come away feeling cleaner, and oddly, somehow satisfied. I don&#x27;t like to shave. Never have. But the double edge razor, shaving brush/cup experience helps. That was a surprise. I don&#x27;t get it, but it&#x27;s true. Weird!</li>
    <li> Great shave I like this better than my Mach 3 razors which were very expensive.&lt;br /&gt;This razor give a much closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GREAT also my brother-in-law in Texas bought himself one and loves the shave.</li>
    <li> I receive this razor, Proraso soap, and a Luxor Pro badger brush as a christmas gift.  They changed my life.  Shaving used to be a daily chore done during my shower.  Now it is a ritual performed every other day, a little get-away, a face massage, aroma therapy, and I come away with a face much smoother than my Mach 3 ever achieved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This takes some getting used to.  You do not use this same way as a disposable or cartridge razor.  Watch YouTube videos (mantic59 and geofatboy in particular), visit forums (I like badgerandblade.com), investigate, explore, discover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still trying to find the &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; blade for my face, but I think I have my technique down pat.  I have less bumps, less razor burn, less irritation, and feel better.  I no longer need to shave every morning; I can shave in the evening (Sunday), have a smooth face on Monday, shave Tuesday morning, have a &amp;#34;socially acceptable shave&amp;#34; all day Wednesday, shave again Thursday, and not have to shave again until Monday unless I choose to.  Try getting that with a Mach 3 and a can shaving gunk.</li>
    <li> This is a nicely made razor.  I don&#x27;t have much experience with this style of razor but I am enjoying the one I have.  Made in Germany.  The instructions are written by someone that obviously isn&#x27;t fluent in English but the razor is fairly self-explanatory.  Has a nice heft to it and a nice long handle with knurling.  Comes with one Merkur razor blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was quick.  Packaging was sufficient.  Package arrived one time and in good condition.</li>
    <li> I am in my 60&#x27;s and finally got sick of paying $4.00/blade for the gillette fusion razor.  Sound familiar.  So I ordered the Merkur 180, shaving soap, brush and a handful of different blades for my conversion to a DE shave.&lt;br /&gt;The Merkur arrived yesterday and today I used it.  I must say I was very nervous.  I expected to have a bloody mess on my hands, but, voila, no cuts...not even a nick...just an excellent shave!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For this debut I used a few drops of &amp;#34;Shave Secret&amp;#34; lotion, gillette foamy creme(my soap and brush have not arrived yet, and the Merkur blade that came with the razor.  I slowly made the first pass with my hand shaking.  Nothing...no cut, 2nd pass, etc, etc.&lt;br /&gt;When I finished, I had a real close shave and almost couldn&#x27;t believe I had done it!  Now I can&#x27;t wait to try other blades to find the perfect shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can safely say that this shave was far superior to any disposible razor or Gillette Fusion shave.  I can&#x27;t compare the Merkur 180 to other DE razors, since I haven&#x27;t used any others.  But I will say the razor just seemed &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; for me.  Very comfortable and heavy enough to let the razor do the work with literally no pressure from me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  Loading and using a 3-piece razor(which was a concern couldn&#x27;t have been easier.  A monkey could be taught to handle the 3-pieces...so don&#x27;t let that even be a factor in choosing a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars for me!</li>
    <li> I start out shaving with a straight razor, then my dad gave me a safety razor for Christmas, I still miss my straight razor but I got use to it ,carry it in the navy then I lost it and couldn&#x27;t find a replacement, so I went to the other razor but l didn&#x27;t get the close shave that I could before. Found my straight razor but my stroke may it not the way to shave. I saw and ad for safety razor on tv, so went to amazon and they had good selection and hard to decide but I remember that my razor was made in Germany , so I went with your razor an I gotten that close shave feeling again</li>
    <li> I have been researching for a while trying to discover products or shaving methods that give you a close shave without irritation and redness. I have tried all of the 3 and 4 bladed wonders and all the gels and foams to absolutely NO avail. During my research, I discovered that these double edged safety razors were getting outstanding reviews, even better than the 3 and 4 blade wonders we are all using!! I decided to order one, because at this point i don&#x27;t have anything to lose, i already have irritated skin from shaving, so the worst that could happen is it would stay like that.     Well the razor came yesterday, and i used it last night. Using correct form, no pressure, and good quality shave cream, these razors will live up to the hype and even exceed it. Now, i DID cut myself once or twice, but only because I am still learning how to adjust to this razor, but it gave me an extremely close shave. I am confident that with practice and repetition, razor burn and irritation will go away completely. If anyone has sensitive skin or is tired of the 4 blade wonder, order a Merkur and discover how to get the correct, best shave.</li>
    <li> I purchased this along with the Merkur Double Edge Razor Blades.  It has a substantial feel to it, it&#x27;s easy to use and clean, and it looks good.  You can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000NL0T1G Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor - #180 - Made In Germany]]  I used the Merkur razor for the last week and have been very impressed. I don&#x27;t know how we began using cartridge blades but I will never go back. I recently bought an electric razor because I must shave twice a day and it is very convenient if I have evening engagements. I found that the results of the foil electric were superior to my Gillett Fusion. However, after using the Merkur I realized that a blade is still superior, my wife noticed very quickly. The real selling point for the Merkur, beside the comfort and effectiveness, is cost. Even at discounters, cartridge blades are enormously overpriced for what you get. I don&#x27;t think anyone will be disappointed by this purchase. Be advised, it will take two shaves to adjust to the different dynamics of this razor - take it slow and easy.</li>
    <li> It is a great product except too many steps so it takes a lot of time to shave- I&#x27;d rethink it before purchasing this.</li>
    <li> My husband has been hinting around that he wanted one of these razors, like what his grandpa used to use. So I bought it for Father&#x27;s Day for him.  He absolutely loves it! And I love how smooth his face is now.  No more expensive Mach3 razors!</li>
    <li> The razor is of good quality, solid, and well constructed.  I was surprised that I had to remove the entire top of the razor - head is threaded on to the handle - to install the razor blade.  Will need to use caution when replacing the blade and hold with a cloth to keep fingers away from the blade.  It is supposed to be long-handled but the handle is actually shorter than the atra style I was replacing.  The regular length must be really short.  As for the shave -- seems good and shaves as close as a twin blade razor.  Not better.  Shaving is slower until I get used to this unit but then it&#x27;s not a race.  As I have a mustache, shaving the top and in the space immediately under the nose is slow and very cautious -- this razor is much broader than the twin blade.  Also, I forget that I can use the other side before rinsing so another &#x27;get used to it&#x27; habit. Initial cost with 10 blades will still not make up for twin blade for awhile but in the long run (years) it should be less expensive.  Hopefully I will stay with it that long.</li>
    <li> Got this for my son for Christmas. He is in the military and needs a close shave and this really does the trick. And it comes with everything he needs</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an awesome product. I paid 30 or so dollars for it which I thought was a little expensive. The reality is I&#x27;ve had it for about two months and it&#x27;s already paid for itself:  nice clean shaved every time and I almost always use a new blade.  Better shaves at a fraction of the price from buying those expensive cartridges.</li>
    <li> If took me a few shaves to get the hang of it but I felt my balls drop after each use.</li>
    <li> After I started shaving with my grandpa&#x27;s old safety razor, my wife wanted one too. The long handle is great for legs, and the chrome finish complements Colonel Conk&#x27;s Chrome Safety Razor Stand (also available on Amazon) wonderfully.</li>
    <li> No more shaving bump. Super close shave. I&#x27;m sooooo glad i made the jump and tried this razor. It&#x27;s been 2 months and I&#x27;m never going back to the expensive cartridge razors. Blades are cheap and the shave is better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shave without a mirror in the shower. I wet my face with hot water and let it soak for a few minutes. Then I use Barbasol Shaving Cream and apply directly without a shaving brush. I then shave and use witchhazel as aftershave. No more shaving bumps! Woo hoo!</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this but my sensitive skin couldn&#x27;t take it. Don&#x27;t recommend this if you have sensitive skin. Tried several different types of blades just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Good razor, great weight. But can&#x27;t say I like the mechanism they use to put the blade in, if you are not careful you can get hurt.</li>
    <li> enough heft to do the job, great starter razor, blade that comes with it is nice but only lasted 5 shaves until it started chipping away at my skin. Would Buy Again</li>
    <li> Got this as a gift for someone and they love it. Super close shave and easy to use after a few times. Saves lots of money as the blades for it are dirt cheap. Close shave and cheap blades- what more could you ask for?</li>
    <li> Simple, strong, does what its supposed to do. I have no complaints about this product. I use it everyday and the quality is great, so this may last for a long time.</li>
    <li> Tired of spending $4 for a cartridge razor?  This is the solution.  I tried these with Personna razors for the price of a couple months cartridges.  It has taken me about  months to get good at using them (expect some nicks!).  For the price of three cartridges, I have at least two years of razors.  I like using the soap and brush, and honestly it&#x27;s kind of cool to shave like my grandfather did!</li>
    <li> It is my first safety razor, I bought it because my dad&#x27;s old razor could not be found when I wanted to give this type of shave a go.  I do say, I&#x27;m using astra blades and this is a great shave. It&#x27;s very different from using a cartridge type razor.  The shave is deceptively close.  By that I mean that while shaving it feels like its not close enough the way a cartridge shave feels during shaving but after everything is done and I do a cold wash and then aftershave and lotion about 5 to 10 minutes after my face is SUPER smooth.  I also smell nice from all the soap and lotions and stuff too ;p Shaving is no longer a chore for me that I try to get through as fast as possible.  It is now a break from the day.  I take my time and enjoy this peaceful activity. This is starting to sound like a lame blog post but I do think everyone should give this type of shaving a try.</li>
    <li> Great quality and beautiful finish.  Feels like a good, old fashion tool, designed to get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;Well balanced and designed for functionality. I dropped it under the shower quiet few times - no issues.&lt;br /&gt;It is made in Germany. It will last.&lt;br /&gt;It will pay for itself quickly.  Razors and cheap and last long time.  Shave is clean and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;After using it for few months I haven&#x27;t cut myself even once, JINX!&lt;br /&gt;I no longer have my drawer full of different handles, trying to remember which overpriced cartridge should I buy.</li>
    <li> How much do you pay for a shave?  $10 a week?  What makes that worse is that the cartridge razor has actually made our shaves worse!!  Stacked blades that tug and cut our beards leads to ingrown hair and irritated skin.  .. but it doesn&#x27;t need to be that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spend a few dollars on a nice handle, and then slip a $0.75 razor blad into it once a week.  It&#x27;s far cheaper than the cartridge blades over the course of a year.  The shave quality you get from a double-edge razor blade is incredible!!... and because it&#x27;s cutting the hair at the skin instead of lifting it and then cutting it, no more ingrown hair or razor burn!!  Brilliant!!  Why did we ever stop using these?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mastering the double edged razor is quick and easy.  I&#x27;m nearly as fast with this razor as I was with the Fusion.. only my shave is better now.  It only took me a few days to get used to it.. and now I can&#x27;t go back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Add some class to your morning routine, shave like a man.</li>
    <li> Present for my son!  Exactly what he wanted.  He has used these razors before and will use nothing else now!  Super fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this with Feather blades and Proraso green and it&#x27;s without doubt a big improvement on all the electric and disposable razors I&#x27;ve tried. It takes a little practice, but once you&#x27;ve got the hang of it it doesn&#x27;t take much more time, and the shave feels much nicer and catches more hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from how well it works, it&#x27;s beautifully simple and elegant compared to the alternatives. Just three parts, all non-moving, held together securely by screw threads in the handle. I expect this to last me for decades. The only downside is that you have to grip the head to disasssemble it and replace a blade, which is a bit dangerous.</li>
    <li> Shifted to use of this after many years of using a Gillette product. They seem to have changed the life of the blades as well as the glide strip and I was tired of buying replacements.&lt;br /&gt;This razor feels nice and is well weighted. The included blade (sample) was quite rough and thankfully, i had ordered DERBY blades as well which are absolutely fantastic.It does take a bit to get used to it after using the usual razors for a while however the shave is clean and smooth.</li>
    <li> first time I ever shaved and didn&#x27;t need to U.S.A.F in 1961.&lt;br /&gt;Forgot over the years how good these work,&lt;br /&gt;Used the expensive  2 blade and cheap throw a way&#x27;s for last 30 years.&lt;br /&gt;just got it today and had a 3 day growth, I dread shaving, used regular shaving cream and wet the beard.&lt;br /&gt;wow, took it off and didn&#x27;t nick my face and twice as fast,  this thing is great, I used the blade that came with it, I ordered the&lt;br /&gt; persona 100 pack because of the reviews and American made&lt;br /&gt;buy it you won&#x27;t be sorry&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;48 hours later&lt;br /&gt;like I said I didn&#x27;t properly get ready for the first shaving because I was excited to try the new shaver, I haven&#x27;t shaved since the first time, what a difference. the other two blades and throw a way&#x27;s would have never matched the new shaver.  I have what would have been growth for one or less days and it has been two full days with the new razorsure glad I bought it</li>
    <li> This is my first time use this Merkur and it seem alright. After a while I get used to It and it cheaper than the other razor.</li>
    <li> I have been using the double edge single blade razor for going on 40 years. This one is of excellent ballance and quality. Highly recommend the Wilkinson Sword brand of blades to be used with this. I won&#x27;t be needing to by another razor for quit a long time.</li>
    <li> My shaving experience has changed drastically since I decided to stop shelling out close to $20 a month on cartridge refills.  I suggest you do the same.  I paired this well built razor with the Feather razor blades and a new shaving cream &amp; badger brush and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I get a very close shave and no longer have razor burn on my neck.  It does take some getting used to and you&#x27;ll likely get a few nicks along the way but it&#x27;s well worth it.  I actually enjoy shaving now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other products I bought:&lt;br /&gt;CO Bigelow from Bath &amp; Body Works Shaving Cream&lt;br /&gt;Simply Beautiful Basic 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush&lt;br /&gt;The Art of Shaving Brush Stand</li>
    <li> I like many of you have been taught to believe that the best shave comes from the Gillette Fusion.  However, if you give this &#x27;system&#x27; a try, you will not be disappointed.  I was searching for the best shave regardless of price.  The price of the DE system is fantastic as we all know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, if you give this a try and you change your way of shaving a bit, you will be rewarded with the best shaves of your life.  To clear up a few myths:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will NOT cut yourself more - i cut myself once due to me rushing&lt;br /&gt;You CAN shave against the grain - I do it every day with no irritation and the results are stunning&lt;br /&gt;You WILL have to take your time - This is true.  You can&#x27;t fly through your shave as their is no lube strip or fins&lt;br /&gt;The stock blade they ship with this is not the best - True.  Pick up a sampler pack.  My first blade after the stock Merkur was a Bluebird and it is better&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So give it a try.  If you keep an open mind you&#x27;ll save money but more importantly - get a great close consistent shave.</li>
    <li> This is the best shave I have ever gotten. I love this razor. I did a lot of research before purchasing, and I am glad I made the jump. The initial cost of the razor is nothing compared to the savings I will have on replacement blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did not take long to learn how to use this razor effectively. I am finding that the more I use this razor, the less often I am having to replace the blades. I have been using this for about a month, and I have to say that I am glad I purchased this.</li>
    <li> My facial hair is not thick and grows slowly and I only have to shave every few days, so using a cartridge razor isn&#x27;t the same investment as for someone with a dense beard. Still, when buying cartridges the exorbitant prices are really galling. When talking about this with a friend he mentioned DE razors, but I didn&#x27;t seriously consider switching until I had to buy new handles over the past year when the drugstore didn&#x27;t carry the cartridges for my brand and another was no longer stocked. Also since I found those new razors to be really irritating for my skin that meant trying yet another brand once the cartridges ran out, or trying something different. After checking out the online forums, articles and videos about DE razors (it&#x27;s weird to watch videos of men shaving but also very helpful) I bought the Merkur razor, Derby blades and an inexpensive soap and brush kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my first shave I was prepared for the worst, and was then shocked by my success. I nicked my neck once lightly, but I&#x27;ve had worse issues in that area with cartridge razors. Otherwise despite some rawness I had a perfectly smooth pleasant shave (I imagine there are more issues for guys with heavy beards). The unexpected benefit was that my facial hair grew back in evenly with no ingrown hairs or irritated areas. I did not know it was possible to not suffer from that given my experience over 25+ years of shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then I&#x27;ve tried Feather blades and they worked fine, but for my relatively light facial hair there was no significant difference from the Derby. I&#x27;ve upgraded my soap, am looking at another brush and may try another model of razor. It&#x27;s not much of an investment if I consider how much cartridge razors cost me and that 100 Derby blades I got for $7 should last me at least two years if I&#x27;m wasteful with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the interesting things about DE shaving is that it takes more preparation and care. All the online information available, including these reviews, can be opinionated and detailed to the point of obsession. It&#x27;s often amusing and sometimes off-putting. In practice, after some adjustment, the care and self-attention involved can be very refreshing and gratifying. This thing that once was a chore becomes a personal ritual and then all the fuss is a whole lot more understandable.</li>
    <li> I picked this up based on Amazon&#x27;s ratings and it did not disappoint!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried 5 or 6 of the expensive cartridge razors over the years and none of them come close to this. I ordered some Feather blades to go along with it, also excellent. Now that I&#x27;ve tried this classic method I don&#x27;t even know why they made expensive multiblade nonsense in the first place (I&#x27;m guessing to extort more money by marketing to younger consumers).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Closer shave, no razor burn, no cuts, and hairs don&#x27;t get stuck like they do in modern razors! It&#x27;s also far far cheaper after the initial investment.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how much better a shave this one blade razor gives me. then again I can because I can use this one razor the rest of my life with replacement blades for a year costing what one refill pack of the newest &amp;#34;6 blade&amp;#34; cartridges cost. Best shaving decision you will ever make</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 73 years old and I should of bought this one 40 or 50 years ago. ( I don&#x27;t know if they made these  then) But I used a 2 blade razor for many ,many years, and since I bought this I would never go back to one that has more then 1 blade.  It out beats a 2 blade by far..It is a little hard to change the blade, maybe I should of bought the one with a butterfly closer , but this one works well with me.</li>
    <li> I really like the weight and length of this razor. The only downside of it is replacing the blades. You have to unscrew the handle and take the two piece head apart to put a new blade in. It takes a bit of care not to grab the old blade incorrectly and cut yourself. I do prefer the &#x27;butterfly&#x27; version of these razors where the blade is loaded in at the top by a butterfly opening.</li>
    <li> But that&#x27;s enough to know that this is the best razor I&#x27;ve used.  I have a very tough beard, and disposable razors usually handled the job, but adequately at best. This is the first razor I&#x27;ve used since I was a teen that left my face smooth.  Can&#x27;t recommend enough, and SimplyBeautiful (the merchant) got it to me quickly.</li>
    <li> for those looking into diving into the world of safety razors, i&#x27;d recommend it. in the long term it has saved me money and has given me many a close shaves.</li>
    <li> It was a problem.  He hated to shave, so when you hate something, you don&#x27;t do it unless the wife nags.  Well I don&#x27;t want to be the nagging wife, so I was desperate, and looked into other options than the Mach3 that he was using.  I came accross this and thought to myself, this might work.  I read the reviews, watched the videos on YouTube, and bought it for Christmas, (along with brushes creams extra blades brush holders)  the whole nine yards!  Lucky gal I am, HE LOVES IT.  We were both scared the very first time he used it...took a bit of time to get used to the weight &amp; angle, but one he found the &amp;#34;spot&amp;#34; off to the races he went.  He shaves everyday, and it is quick.  He just said to me the other day that lathering takes longerthan the actual shave.  He &amp; I love how close of a shave it is.  NEVER AGAIN will he use the crap razors.</li>
    <li> Relearning to handle a double-edge safety razor is fun!  This Merkur is a high-quality razor that felt good in my hand right from the start.  It makes shaving fun again!  I also got a full week of shaving from the included blade.  Naturally, I ordered more blades (a sample pack), so I&#x27;m excited see which blades work best for me.  And at 30 to 35 cents a blade, I&#x27;m saving a bunch over Gillette Fusion blades.  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> He loves it. I&#x27;ll try it later. The long blade is appealing and seems it would be easier to handle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had the razor for a few weeks, but overall it feels great, high quality, and relatively simple design.</li>
    <li> So I bought this on 9/9/11, today is 3/3/14, woke up this morning to my trusty razor, put in a new blade, went to tighten the handle on to clamp down the blade and BAM, the stud the handle screws into that&#x27;s &amp;#34;pressed&amp;#34; into the smooth hump up top actually popped out. Turns out it&#x27;s more or less just glued in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering these things are suppose to last years, I&#x27;m very upset with this build quality. I bought a Merkur because I&#x27;ve read it was better than Parker, but now I know for myself that&#x27;s hardly true.</li>
    <li> The razor workes great, even in my big deft hands, never using a safty razor before I found it to work beautifully and never leaves burn or uncut hair. I&#x27;m very pleased with the product I received, quickly and on time.</li>
    <li> Great balance and a great shave, glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> Buy the Shark razors to go with this. You will be Golden!</li>
    <li> not as a close shave as I thought it would be and I get closer shaves with bic razor  and shaving cream</li>
    <li> After many years of electric shaving I decided to get back into shaving with a razor. Every time I went to buy the triple blades, I complained about the cost of them. Now I can afford them, but did not like being ripped off.  I purchase a Parker 97 long handle but found it a bit to heavy on the head end, for my taste. It was not a bad razor, but the finish was already stating to rub off after four months of use. I decided to try the Merkur and it has made a big difference I have better control with it. I think I have a winner with this one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to the DE shaving world so I didn&#x27;t have much reference on which way to go as far as razors.  I read the reviews and decided on buying the Merkur 23C first.  It was the most popular razor on Amazon.  I used it for about three weeks and decided it was just not giving me the close shave I wanted.  I did some more research and discovered a more aggressive razor which is the Merkur 38 HD.  I bought the 38 HD and the first time I used it I took the blade out of the 23C and put it in my drawer.  It was that much of a difference. I&#x27;m not a heavy bearded guy, but I like a smooth finish when I&#x27;m done.  If I&#x27;m going through the trouble of making my own lather and buying a brush, I want a good shave! I&#x27;ll just use the 23C for my travel case.  The bottom line is the 23C just didn&#x27;t do the job the 38 HD did.  I hope reading this prevents you from making the same mistake I made.  Happy Shaving.</li>
    <li> The Merkur shaver gives an amazing shave every time!  Smooth, no cuts.  I was tired of the lousy shaves from the Schick and Gillette shavers.  I wish I had bought this a long time ago.  My favorite blades are the Merkur blades, but I also like the Wilkinson Sword Blades and the Shark Blades.</li>
    <li> I bought the Merkur long handle Safety DE razor and am completely amazed.  I would highly recommend this razor for a beginner or veteran with DE razors.  I have very course facial hair and can grow a really thick beard.  I cannot express enough how smooth this razor shaves! In the past I have had other safety DE razors and this just blew any of those out of the water.  Now saying that I do use Personna DE razor blades as well.  I have found them to be the sharpest blades that don&#x27;t nick your face at all.  I can say that I found the best combination out there.  The Merkur DE razer with Personna blades..  You cannot beat it.  Now the only thing for you do is try it out yourself.  I can guaranty you will not be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:  Changing the razor blades is a little dangerous BUT totally worth it :)</li>
    <li> I shave my face and my head, so I was a little intimidated when I started my very first shave with this. All of that nervousness was for nothing. This razor is very easy to use and gives a fantastic shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, I was genuinely surprised at how close of a shave this single blade razor gave me. Better than the multi-blade replaceable head razor that cost me waaaay too much for blades that dulled waaaay too quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The single blade doesn&#x27;t clog like multi-blade razor heads and replacement blades are so cheap, you could use a new blade for every shave and still save money. I just bought 300 Astrid blades on Amazon for $30. I did some math and that is 3 years worth of shaves for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep each blade for two to three shaves. However, I shave my head and face, so I&#x27;m putting down more miles per shave. If you shave only your face, you could potentially get more shaves out of these blades. I have never shaved with a blade until I noticed it was getting dull because these replacements are so cheap, why wait until your shave is uncomfortable? I also remove my blades between shaves and store them in a small container of mineral oil to help stave off corrosion and keep my blades extra sharp (a little tip I picked up on the net that works like a charm).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a shave oil and then apply shaving cream and so far, I have nearly eliminated any razor rash I used to get on my throat while shaving more frequently than ever before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always though different types of shaving creams were just a racket and I can tell you now, that is just not the case. If you use this razor with a good shaving oil and a nice glycerin based shaving cream, it will give you a closer smoother shave than you have probably ever had before that lasts longer than you have ever had a shave last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, I have talked this thing up, so now the cons. I will say, in my opinion, this is not the razor if you wake up late for work and need to sling a blade over your face in five seconds before running out the door. If that is the case, buy an electric. Due to the fact that razor head is polished steel without any lubricating strip (that you are probably used to on your multi-blade replaceable) it is important to use a good shaving cream and oil combo that will provide your skin with lubricity. But, if you are like me and shower before shaving and use oil and shaving cream, this thing will glide over your face like butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to clean, looks great, feels great an is worth every single penny. I just ordered a silver tip badger brush (which I was also skeptical about, but am now a believer) and that should arrive shortly to accompany this great razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your on the fence, order the razor. Worst case scenario, you don&#x27;t like it and return it. Likely scenario, you love it and save a ton of cash on razors while getting a superior shave.</li>
    <li> Great product. Just buy it already. The product writes its own review.</li>
    <li> Nice heft to this razor. The mechanism works well but I needed to figure out the best way to change/clean blades without cutting myself. I find placing it on a counter upside down, holding the sides, and unscrewing the handle works best for me. Just reverse the process when closing.</li>
    <li> Hey just got this Merkur 23c (180) and it is great for a head shave. Only nicked myself once. I did have to make multiple passes as the DE razor doesnt mow the hair down like a cartridge razor. However this shave is so much closer and cleaner. I must say I was a bit hesitant to try a DE on my head due to all the skill it takes to use this type of razor. Ive never used a DE in my life, but I have shaved my head clean for 6 years. I keep the razor at a 30 degree angle like many of the videos I watched suggested and I did fine. Just take your time and it will go great. I&#x27;m so pumped to use this razor again. I truly feel that I have experienced my first &amp;#34;REAL&amp;#34; shave.</li>
    <li> Based on all of my research this is a great starting DE razor. I am still getting used to it but so far it&#x27;s already better than the Mach 3 I relied on for years. I am a bigger guy 6&#x27;5&amp;#34; and the handle is nice and long to accommodate my mitts. Great seller, great product, fast delivery and minimal packaging. Have already recommended to some of my friends.</li>
    <li> My hubby loves it. He did a lot of research on which one to buy and he&#x27;s glad he chose this one.</li>
    <li> If Thor used a razor, this would be it. Beautiful shiny plating, awesome grip and balance. If you&#x27;ve thought about trying DE shaving, this is the perfect razor. The included blade wasn&#x27;t good for my face and it struggled on my tough beard that was only two days old. Try Astral blades, also purchased through Amazon they&#x27;re great and cheap. Grandpa had it right get a safety razor, particularly this one. Germany builds great automobiles and great razors, Merkur is king!</li>
    <li> Had it been sent like all the other prime stuff I would have it right now. Unfortunately it&#x27;s somewhere in the world and I&#x27;m sitting here with a beard. I hope it gets back to them sometime soon so I can get my refund. When you get a prime item you expect it on time like everything else but almost a month later and I&#x27;m still waiting.</li>
    <li> This is my first ever DE safety razor and I love it.  I was tired of paying $25.00 for four multi blade Mach 8, vibrating, rotating spinning blades.  I began researching on line about the &amp;#34; old fashioned&amp;#34; way of shaving with a double edge safety razor.  I was sure I would cut myself up horribly like I read some reviews have done.  But after one month I have had no nicks or cuts- and I shave my entire head and face.  I think the longer handle helped me to transition from multi blade cartridges to DE blades easier with fewer problems.</li>
    <li> This is my first experience with wet shaving and it was awesome. I just finished my first shave this morning&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came from Gilette Fusion and their stupid expensive razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing has a solid build and was a lot easier to shave with than I thought,</li>
    <li> Like every one else I thought it&#x27;ll be nice to save some money on shaving! I used the shaver for one week and came to conclusion old technology is good for than and it was good than because that is as best as it got! The new disposable razors get the job done in half the time and with less blood and with much closer shave! This shaver is cool at best but, it dose not compare in getting the job done to even a Wal-Mart brand triple blade!</li>
    <li> This razor has given me the closest shave I have ever had. I could kick myself for waiting so long. As long as you use a good lubricating shave cream (I use Kiss My Face), multiple strokes to remove beard and letting the weight of the razor to apply the proper pressure to your face your in business. I have not had one nick or cut. I do recommend that you buy a sampler pack of different razors to find the right one for you, I settled on the Shark brand.  Great Razor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jay R</li>
    <li> I am seriously in love. I used it as soon as I got it and am already blown away by the difference. I&#x27;ve been using disposable razors as per my mother&#x27;s instruction since I was a little kid. When assessing what ways I could reduce the amount of plastic I go through regularly, I realized that I throw out a razor at least once every two weeks because the razors work horribly and would get gungy after one use! When looking at the reviews on this razor, I was very interested to finally find out what a safety razor was like. I love it! I seriously love it, after not enjoying shaving at all due to always (and I mean every single time I shave) getting cuts for reasons I couldn&#x27;t figure out, I am finally very satisfied. This razor cuts smooth and clean, no nicks or scrapes, it feels nice! I am a 19 year old woman, and I am seriously going to recommend this to anyone who is looking for a great razor. Maybe I&#x27;ll even buy one for my fiance! It doesn&#x27;t come with instructions (not in English anyways), so those that don&#x27;t already know how to use it, you just unscrew the top part of the handle from the part where the razor is held, the razor isn&#x27;t already in place, so don&#x27;t worry about cutting yourself; unwrap the razor blade, place it over the metal nubs and then screw it all back together! I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with a razor!</li>
    <li> I will gladly buy this again if I lost the one I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally bought the regular length handle razor and it was good enough, but felt that the longer handle would be more comfortable and give me a better weight, balance and leverage to apply the right amount of tilt and pressure (or no pressure) and weight. And I was right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The build quality and finish are good, but not excellent.</li>
    <li> I use this razor exclusively with Feather blades. Every other razor I own (Parker 99R, Merkur Progress,and Futur)literally shred my face when loaded with a Feather blade. I almost wrote off the Feather blades, accepting the fact that maybe as many have said about them, the super sharp Feather blades simply weren&#x27;t for me. I&#x27;d resigned myself to the fact that the 50 I had bought will never be used. But then I loaded one into the Merkur 180. Closest shave ever with no nicks, or razor burn. And I can get 4 or 5 shaves before I notice a drop in shave quality.</li>
    <li> I did my research, read the blogs and boards, and decided to purchase this DE razor. SO far I have no complaints, but I also have nothing else to base an opinion on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of construction, it&#x27;s solid. I have had it for about 6 months now. It holds razors the way it&#x27;s supposed to and after a few weeks of trail and error, I have pretty much got my technique down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the razor, and I&#x27;m darn glad I made the switch to wet shaving!</li>
    <li> Love my Merkur 180.  Was sick of paying for replacement double\triple edge razor cartridges that clogged easily.&lt;br /&gt;Just buy this quality razor and a package  of 7AM single blade safety razors and you&#x27;re good for the year.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought 3 of these as gifts btw.</li>
    <li> Be sure and read all of the other fine reviews for safety razor shaving items on Amazon. I did and followed their advice. Get all of them for the perfect set for yourself or as a great gift for somebody else:&lt;br /&gt;Edwin Jagger Rn6 Contemporary Chrome Plated Shaving Soap Bowl, Chrome&lt;br /&gt;Colonel Conk Evernice Model 775 Chrome Safety Razor Stand&lt;br /&gt;Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor&lt;br /&gt;10 Feather Razor Blades NEW Hi-stainless Double Edge&lt;br /&gt;Proraso Shaving Soap, Eucalyptus &amp; Menthol, 5.2 oz (150 ml), New...&lt;br /&gt;Parker Safety Razor 100% Silvertip Badger Bristle Shaving Brush (Chrome...&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a great site for further shaving tips:&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> Works exactly as it should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be warned, you may need to watch tutorials on youtube of men shaving with this to get a super close shave, because it is a process.</li>
    <li> Will never go back to a Mach III. My shave last longer. No longer have irritation marks on my nechline. and Blades are super cheap, and last forever.</li>
    <li> Quality product but not for me, just didn&#x27;t get a close shave ! I prefer the multi blade&#x27;s. Thought I&#x27;d give my dad&#x27;s old razor a try but like I said not a close shave and nervous about cutting myself .</li>
    <li> Just like so many others, I decided to get this Merkur 180 razor as my first DE safety razor because I got tired of paying for expensive cartridges. Also, like many others, I grew up watching my dad shave with a safety razor. I have this Merkur a try and will never look back. I get a baby-butt-smooth shave in three passes. A little while after buying this Merkur I also bought a Feather Popular DE Safety Razor. The Feather Popular leaves a lot to be desired compared to the Merkur. Since the Merkur 180 is my first DE safety razor, it may be my last. I&#x27;d like to buy a Edwin Jagger DE89 and see how that compares since that is also a very popular and well respected razor. But for now, this Merkur is far superior to my Gillette Mach 3 Turbo and my Feather Popular. A close, smooth, easy shave. The only regret I have is not having bought this razor years ago!</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THIS BECAUSE I WAS TOLD IT WOULD GIVE ME A BETTER AND CLOSER SHAVE THAN THE DISPOSABLE RAZORS I BUY. BUT IT DIDN&#x27;T. IT LEFT MANY HAIRS STILL ON MY FACE AND MANY CUTS TOO.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor as a gift for my dad. This is his first safety razor but I got it because he is a big guy with big hands so I figured the long handle would suit him better. I can say now that my Dad loves this razor. He tells me every time I see him how much he loves it and as a bonus, you don&#x27;t have to throw away all those plastic disposable razors so it&#x27;s also a great razor for environmentally savvy people!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wet shaving for about 5 months, and have had the Merkur 180 the entire time. It&#x27;s very easy to use and has great weight balance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue with it is that my shaving soap has left a thin film on the razor, and it&#x27;s hard to remove. This doesn&#x27;t affect the razor much, though, since the handle has a textured grip, and it doesn&#x27;t get slippery when wet. The film can cause some hair to stick to the razor, however, and I then have to scrub it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t disassemble and clean between uses, which admittedly might be the reason the film accumulates.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost 6 months and I wish I would of made the switch sooner.  The razor is solid and good quality.  I dry take mine apart and dry it out every time I use or else it gets water marks on it.  This will give you a nice close shave for a fraction of the cost of the multi blade razors.  I would buy a few different blades to find which one works best for you because they are all a bit different.</li>
    <li> Quality product. This razor has a beautiful finish and a nice heavy feel to it. It gives me a very close and accurate shave. And it&#x27;s a money saver!  Even with new blades, they cost so much less than the mainstream razor brands.</li>
    <li> This is my third Merkur safety razor and just like the other 2, this one is great.  There really isn&#x27;t much to say -- it&#x27;s a sturdy safety razor, feels neither too light nor too heavy.  Only complaint I can even think of is that I wish the handle was slightly thicker maybe but that&#x27;s only because I have big hands (for reference, I can palm a basketball without a problem).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone looking for a solid safety razor who doesn&#x27;t want a short handle.</li>
    <li> Great quality razor that will last a lifetime. I have owned several safety razors but this has become my primary razor. I get a very close shave with low maintenance. The long handle makes a big difference in control and comfort in the hand. Before you start each day make sure the head is on tight as it will loosen up if you are not familiar with using this type of razor. Other cheaper razors have rusted when water is left on them unlike this razor. The metal is high quality and can take being left wet.</li>
    <li> Best shave I&#x27;ve ever had. I will never go back to a multi-blade razor.</li>
    <li> Just wanted to get a few words out there on this product for the benefit of my fellow five-o&#x27;clock brethren. This thing has totally changed my life for the better. Go to the supermarket, look at those Gillette/Schick etc. razors and declare NO MORE! That&#x27;s right - wave bye bye for good! For years and years I&#x27;ve frustratingly been draining my bank account on those \\&quot;3 good shave\\&quot; cartridges, trying every brand under the sun, always being left ultimately disappointed. The truth is, they make the men&#x27;s razors (Ever tried your wife&#x27;s/girlfriend&#x27;s Venus cartridge?) to intentionally dull after the first real use.     Anyway, on with the review. I&#x27;ve always grown a thick, full beard and those store bought cartridges just never could cut it. After considering an old-school straight razor for quite some time, I eventually decided to try out this safety razor and boy am I ever glad I did. It is one of the most amazing products you&#x27;ll buy in your lifetime. It&#x27;ll take up to 3 weeks or so to get used to. The first few shaves I got a few cuts, so keep a little poly around (I use the Target brand) It will get easier as your skin&#x27;s sensitivity lessens. These days I rarely get nicked.     In addition to this razor, other complimentary products include:    - [[ASIN:B00BDM0XZG 100 Ct FEATHER HI-STAINLESS DOUBLE EDGE DE RAZOR BLADES NEW HAIR REMOVE MADE IN JAPAN]] [Amazon] (The Platinum type) Try out a few different brands. I didn&#x27;t but going by others reviews I made an informed purchase and it all worked out    For shaving soap I recommend:    - E-Bay seller \\&quot;sbtanning\\&quot;. He/she sells 1.5oz shavings soaps in many very very nice fragrances for $1.75ea. I myself ordered about 10 varieties and 4 months later I&#x27;m still on my first one.     Shaving Stand:     - [[ASIN:B00A3LVMMQ Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand]] [Amazon] Very classy. Some people complain theirs has lost its chrome or rusted, mine has been fine.    Shaving Brush:    - [[ASIN:B003WR3QSG Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush]] [Amazon] Nicely made, high quality, hasn&#x27;t lost a hair yet.    Also I went to a local art show and bought a hand-thrown blue salt-glazed ceramic bowl for my shaving soap. I installed a shelf to the left of our bathroom sink and have everything proudly displayed there.    One thing I should mention, I do find it a little difficult getting the hair just below the nostrils but with a little persistence you can get everything.    So in conclusion, for all the products I&#x27;ve mentioned it&#x27;ll cost about $100 total. Yes it&#x27;s a bit of a gamble and I don&#x27;t guarantee you&#x27;ll be as 100% satisfied as I am, but if it works out for you (and by all accounts it should) then you will never have to buy &#x27;stinkin cartridges again. I should mention that I can get 4 solid shaves at least from each Feather blade so I&#x27;d say that should be good for the next (at least) couple years since I shave every 3rd or so day. All together it has worth every penny.</li>
    <li> The razor and blades are performing very well, thanks.</li>
    <li> Awesome razor. I love the close shave and the visceral feeling of using a quality razor like this.</li>
    <li> Simple, solid, tight machining. Your blade will sit flat, absolutely parallel along the edges. The screw joint is square and snug. Overall excellent design. If you have large hands and/or thick fingers you will appreciate the length and heft or this razor. At the risk of incurring sexism allegations I would say there&#x27;s a sufficient fear factor to the Merkur&#x27;s design that those who shave areas of their body other than their whiskered chins will avoid it completely.</li>
    <li> A solid well made razor, that shaves better than the disposable ones I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I received this razor for a birthday present about 3 months ago.  The quality of it is excellent.  It shaves smoothly without nicks or cuts.  I waited to write this review because I wanted to get use to it.  I felt the shave I was getting was not a close as my triple blade razor and tried different shaving techniques to improve the shave.  Each shave I got a little bit better, but still not a good.  For Christmas I received a badger shaving brush and Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream, something I put on my wish list.  This made the difference in getting an awesome shave and it feels good too!  I highly recommend buying the shaving cream and brush with this razor.  Saving $$$ on blades is a plus too.</li>
    <li> Wonderfully happy with the razor, and am glad with my decision to change from many other blades, all you need is 1 blade and the right angle (Read up on this before you start).</li>
    <li> best investment especially when you see the cost of blades</li>
    <li> Better than any disposable blade if used properly and a hundred times cheaper.</li>
    <li> Still got this thing. Still use it. Shaves my face nice and smooth. You get used to shaving with this thing after about 2 weeks and ur golden. Serisouly these double edge safety razors and way better than the 2-5blade single razors. This product is the  bomb dot com</li>
    <li> Good starting DE razor very mild easy to use. Good for body grooming.</li>
    <li> Husband loves it!  he is very happy with his switch from disposables!  it was easy for him to transition!</li>
    <li> Got this little guy for Christmas. I&#x27;ve always avoided shaving with a razor because I get very bad razor burn which looks like acne on my neck. Sorry, gross I know. A friend recommended a safety razor to help with the irritation. By the gods, it works beautifully! I have shaved several times since Christmas with no irritation. I&#x27;ve just used it with my regular ole&#x27; supermarket shaving cream, but the shave is like no other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it five stars for these reasons:&lt;br /&gt;1. The cost of blades is a no-brainer. It&#x27;s like stealing in comparison to Gillettes&lt;br /&gt;2. One pass shaves just as well, if not better, than a Gillette/Shick/etc...&lt;br /&gt;3. It&#x27;s a sturdy build.&lt;br /&gt;4. The shave is just like a razor you&#x27;re probably already used to (No throat cutting) ;)&lt;br /&gt;5. It&#x27;s classic and makes shaving a more enjoyable experience for me.</li>
    <li> Great starter safety razor</li>
    <li> Gifts.. Told they work really good!!</li>
    <li> Just for the record, I&#x27;m not Linda. I am Mike her husband of 41 years.&lt;br /&gt;Just wanted to say, I like this product but must warn everyone that the blades are good for only TWO shaves.&lt;br /&gt;I do not have a heavy beard, rather medium to light.&lt;br /&gt;The third shave today cut my face to ribbons.</li>
    <li> This is my third DE safety razor. The first was pretty cheap (the Retro Razor) and I loved it, but it again was pretty cheap and gummed up. I splurged a bit on my next razor and got a hefty Merkur which I was very happy with. It broke last week. Looking around online I get the impression the breakage was the result of poor cleaning and maintenance on my part (lesson learned, old school shavers--take care of your gear). I got this model as a replacement and so far it delivers the best shave. I wish it had a bit more weight to it, but other than that it is great. Old school shaving rules!</li>
    <li> Well folks, here is a different review of this razor and DE razor blades (Merkur platinum and Feathers). I have used Gillette products for many years and have been very satisfied, except for price (more on this).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I decided after reading many glowing reviews that I would try DE tehnology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me count the ways that DE is inferior in my judgement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Gillette Proglide gives a closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;2. There is more razor burn with DE.&lt;br /&gt;3. There are far more nicks and cuts with DE razors. I tried DE for about two weeks and this was after watching the excellent video review. I used this razor and Merkur and Feather blades. Merkur was slightly better of the two.&lt;br /&gt;4.The Proglide is better at reaching tough spots on face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only benefit, in my opinion, for DE technology, is the cost. Yes, the Proglide is probably 3 times the cost of the DE blades. But I get longer use and the overall cost is probably twice of the DE system. So if cost is your primary concern go DE, otherwise I cannot recommend it.</li>
    <li> My only drawback? Less than average blade comes with it. I went very rough with this thing while getting used to it and only got minor razor burn (I was only using hot water in the shower, no cream/gel/foam of any kind, no aftershave, nada). The areas I tested on once I got the hang of it are razor burn free. EASY to pick up, as I had no experience using a safety razor or single blade razor before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I started shaving at 20 and went through one pack of replaceable blades before making the jump to something more affordable and better quality. I chose the long handle over the short one after reading some reviews, but maybe it doesn&#x27;t make any difference since the texture already gives you a good grip. Anyone that wants to save money and shave more efficiently would love this product, but extremely careful: you could easily cut yourself. Right now I&#x27;m using this razor with Feather Double Edge Blades Ct10 and it works like a charm.</li>
    <li> This razor is excellent. It is simply and elegantly designed. Changing blades is easy and quick. The razor has a pleasant weight that makes shaving without applying pressure simple to accomplish. I get an amazing, perfectly smooth, ingrown hair free shave every time. Shaving has now become an enjoyable ritual rather than an annoying task that produced mediocre to poor results. I will never again purchase 19 blade cartridge razors! Do yourself a favor and make the switch!</li>
    <li> I had two other safety razors, and this razor is incrediable. I would recommend this to anyone. Plus, it looks to be very solid. The weight is perfect.</li>
    <li> Excellent alternative to multi- blade razors. Takes a little longer but in the end better results. Much more cost effective.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for almost a year; durable tough, basic razor.</li>
    <li> vrey happy good razor</li>
    <li> Buy this razor...that is all. Blades are much cheaper!</li>
    <li> went back old school...great razor good value excellent</li>
    <li> Well made in Germany.&lt;br /&gt;Long handle, High Chrome Polish.&lt;br /&gt;Very good clean close shave.&lt;br /&gt;So nice I bought 3...&lt;br /&gt;Comes with one blade.&lt;br /&gt;A+</li>
    <li> Easy to use, assemble, and clean. Also, cheaper than the cheap razors in the long run.</li>
    <li> I am fully satisfied.</li>
    <li> Built well, shaves nice. Single edge allows for better shaping of facial hair.</li>
    <li> My husband adores this very manly razor :) it is well made and he has has it for three years and still looks new!!</li>
    <li> Well made and just the right weight. I can just let the weight of the handle do the work when I&#x27;m shaving. I&#x27;ve got fairly large hands and it feels like it fits just about perfectly.</li>
    <li> First ever safety razor. Two years later still works and looks just like the first day I got it. I switched over to safety razors due to the razor companies robbing me of my hard earned money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; My facial hair grows real quick and it grows back thick. Those four five blade razors couldn&#x27;t handle more than a week before the quality of my shave dropped. Switched over to this safety razor and I&#x27;m glad I did. 15 bucks will get you enough razors to last you all year! You could use the same blade for two three times and then just throw it away and replace. Easy as that. Just as safe as regular razors and work exactly the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just please for gods sake! If you want a good shave, be patient! Take a hot shower, really clean your face, and properly lather before shaving. Don&#x27;t shave unless you have the time, or else suffer the razor bumble, ingrown hairs, and cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Throw away your disposable razors and start shaving the smart way.</li>
    <li> I just recently switched over to this safety razor from using gillete triple,quadruple and idk i lost count after a while razors for over 10 years. I must say, what a difference! This thing is amazing and feels comfortable and easy to use. I didn&#x27;t even nick myself the first time I ever used one of these. Feels better overall and gives me a closer shave than other deposable razors.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this DE razor for about 3 years now, and the switch from cartridge razor to a safety razor is the best decision I&#x27;ve made in a long while. Shaving is no longer an expensive painful chore. I hesitated for a year or two after first learning of the resurgence of this type of razor, that was a year or two hesitation that cost me almost $500 in disposable garbage. The first shave was a bit nervous but I quickly got the hang of it and have been converting friends and family to this superior way of shaving since. This is a SAFETY razor, so you have to do something pretty bonehead to hurt yourself. It might look sharp and dangerous but really there&#x27;s only a super tiny piece of the blade exposed. Once you realize only the long edge of the blade is sharp, it&#x27;s quite easy and safe to change the blade by gripping only the short edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the actual Merkur, I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with other DE razors, but I can speak of the exceptional level of quality that this Merkur exudes. 3 years I&#x27;ve owned this razor in a hot and damp environment. It&#x27;s traveled with me numerous times, yet it shows no sign of wear and tear. The chrome looks shiny and perfect as the day I bought it. Not a trace of rust or deposits of any kind. The included blade (or was it blades?) was very nice. I went through a whole variety pack (a feat I highly recommend to new DE shavers) before realizing the Merkur blades are my second favorite. But every face is different, so you really need to try a few different blades to find out what works for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is built to last a lifetime. If I ever buy another DE razor, it will be to perform another function, not because the Merkur wore out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for 2 years and consistently get perfect or nearly perfect shaves (blades willing). I&#x27;ve also purchased this for 2 others that were looking to get into a safety razor. The cost comparison between modern razor refills and buying blades for this isn&#x27;t even close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality on this product is fantastic, the metal is thick, well coated. In the 2 years I&#x27;ve owned it I haven&#x27;t seen a chip or any bit of rust on it. It&#x27;s well weighted and balanced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy being smug about how you spend pennies on blades and get a perfect shave every time. You won&#x27;t find better value.</li>
    <li> German quality. A+ rating. Love this razor. Have gifted the same. Delivery fast.</li>
    <li> bought this for my husband for his birthday (his request) he says it works very well and he loves it the handle is a little short he says he would prefer if it was a half to quarter inch longer (said every girl ever) but over all very happy with it. and its has a learning curve so don&#x27;t give up</li>
    <li> Great gift for men! This razor could last a lifetime.</li>
    <li> Corners of the shaving head are too sharp.</li>
    <li> Very happy with my purchase. Not the best shave ever, or a life changing event. Just a great solid product when used with the right blades.  I personally recommend the Astra blades.  When my electric Remington of 20 years died. I wanted to revert back to how I watched my father and his father shave all those years ago. Great throwback. Now I understand why they hated electric shaves.  No burns, cuts or nicks..., thus far.  A great solid product.</li>
    <li> Been using this for over a year now. Great! No sign of wear..</li>
    <li> Great weight and perfect length. Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Anything from Solingen is good quality.</li>
    <li> Great razor has a great balance to it. The Escali Deluxe Chrome stand is a great addition.</li>
    <li> Nothing much to say..solid and dependable</li>
    <li> Great quality. Still going strong a year later.</li>
    <li> Oh man, this gives a great shave.  I&#x27;ve got thick Italian hair that eats razors alive but this has been a game changer for me.  Read up on how to use it and shaving becomes such a pleasant experience!</li>
    <li> I really love the feel of this safety razor.  The blades fit snugly on the post system and line up perfectly, it feels heavy in the hand the way these razors should, and looks like a quality razor should.  One thing to note, even though it is the long handle it&#x27;s still quite short.  Still fits in the hand nicely and makes for a good shave.</li>
    <li> Quality product, I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I was looking at DE razors after I ordered Proraso shaving soap and a badger hair brush for shaving. This one seems to have a very good ratio of strong reviews and low price and so I ordered it. It is frankly a different shaving experience. I was used to a mach3 \\&quot;wet\\&quot; shave in the shower, with the occasional gel/shaving foam for special occasions. As you can probably tell from the reviews, this older fashioned shaving system does take more focus and attention. If you are used to a busy shave, where you have shampoo sitting in your hair and just run the razor over your face to get a quick shave and save time, you will not be able to carry this habit with any safety razor, and you will love it for it. If you are like me, this will become a mind clearing ritual you will enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found myself switching from shaving in the shower to at the sink, largely due to the mirror and it being more convient to have my shaving kit on a counter. I would imagine you could use any shaving gel/foam/soap, but I found I preferred Proraso shaving soap and a brush over most of the conventional brands, it greatly contributes to the experience, as well just leaves your face feeling refreshed. It takes a few moments to lather up, and is actually pretty fun for lack of a better word.&lt;br /&gt;The shaving itself is quick, easy, and painless. I picked it up immediately and had a great shave, and with a few days practice the hesitation I had was replaced with a comfortable trust. It will take your attention and focus, as well as a bit of practice to learn how to best shave on your face. I never felt it, but once or twice when learning, I have nicked myself shaving my neck while being a bit too impatient and enthusiastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor does come with a single Merkur brand blade to get you started and found it to be of good quality. I am currently trying out different types to find the one best for me, but I may go back to the Merkur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any doubts, watch the videoreview that M.D.C. made, where he helps cover some of the basics, while demonstrating the use of the razor itself.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s cheaper razors available from Gillette, Dollar Shave, Harry&#x27;s and pretty much every other company you can think of. The construction quality is good. The single blade doesn&#x27;t work for me personally.</li>
    <li> New to wet shaving I had to pick a razor. I didn&#x27;t want an expensive unit in case I didn&#x27;t stick with it. While I&#x27;m still working on that I can say this razor is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Solid, this is built tough.&lt;br /&gt;No frill, not overly stylish but not ugly.&lt;br /&gt;The shave, well I&#x27;m new, but there isn&#x27;t much 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is a throwback to an era when stuff was simple and built to last. The razor is an investment, the blades are cheap. The blades are changed weekly, but the blade cost is ridiculously low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor is a throwback, it requires more technique, more solid shaving soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor requires one final thing: your time. You don&#x27;t learn to wet shave I&#x27;m a day. You also don&#x27;t wet shave in a hurry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rate this as a 5 star for new wet shavers. I&#x27;m still learning, but I consider it a worthy starting investment. I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot more to start, considering the other items you need to purchase at the start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s some of the other things you need to start:&lt;br /&gt;A badger brush (I got a Parker), aftershave (I purchased Dominican Bay Rum original), soap mug (I chose Colonel Conk 129, it came with a puck of soap), razor blades (I chose Double Edge Safety Razor variety pack, $25!) to try different blade makers, and preferably a stand. I spent a bit more on mine, but you can get one for $20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All told I spent around $140, but that&#x27;s for several months supplies, to say the least.</li>
    <li> I remember being 13 and my dad teaching me to shave. His steps included using a shaving brush and shaving soap and a safety razor... somehow over the past 25 years, I went astray and thought it was necessary to have 5 vibrating blades and extra chemical-laced super shaving cream in a can with another dose of chemical after-shave just to top the whole cake. A friend of mine turned me on to ewg.org and when I started looking at how much cancer causing chemicals were in my everyday shower products I re-examined my shaving habits. Not only could I eliminate a lot of cancer chemicals from my body, but I could also save a ton of money by switching to an old-school shaving system, just like I was taught by my pops. Now that I&#x27;ve been shaving like this for a month, I don&#x27;t understand why the hell I moved away from this type of shaving other than being a sucker for advertising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in comes the Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor into my life.  I was greatly surprised by how easy it was to shave with this; maybe because I&#x27;ve been shaving already for 25 years but 1 month in and I&#x27;m yet to cut myself.  I did by the styptic pen as other recommended but it sits unopened.  The only advice I give you is to let the weight of the razor do the shaving and try and maintain 45 degree angle and always shave with the grain.  Other than that, don&#x27;t slide it horizontal on your face, obviously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the Parker Safety Razor 100% Pure Badger Bristle Shaving Brush and the Bigelow Shaving cream from Bath &amp; Bodyworks.  No aftershave is necessary; just a splash of cold water and I&#x27;m good to go.  Save yourself so money and reduce your exposure to harmful chemicals and shave the real way; just ask your dad.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Mach 3 razor was my razor of choice when it came to shaving. It seemed to provide me a fairly decent shave and I never really complained, that is, until I had to purchase new cartridges. These cartridges are extremely expensive, so when I was on my frugal search for new ones I came across Merkur&#x27;s Long Handled Safety Razor.  After reading the vast number of great reviews, I decided to take a chance and make a change.  I decided to wait to shave so that I could properly test out my new safety razor.  After receiving my package, I quickly assembled the razor and ran to the bathroom. As I began with the first stroke, I was immediately impressed on how the weight of the handle assisted in providing a smooth shave. The razor essentially glided across my skin making me question if I was even using it right. And sure enough, after I rinsed off the excess shaving cream and ran my fingers across my skin to find the best shave I have had thus far. It even got the troublesome stubble underneath my chin the Mach 3 always seemed to miss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product. It costs a little more than a set of new Mach 3 cartridges, but in the long run you&#x27;ll end up saving money. A pack of one hundred new razors cost me about $10 allowing me to shave using a new razor whenever please without worrying about the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that disappointed me about the purchase was that it came with only one razor blade, so be sure to add a pack a razor blades with your purchase.</li>
    <li> Seriously, whenever I use a disposable razor or any kind of razor, it doesn&#x27;t cut off everything. I will still have some stubble left. With the Merkur Safety Razor, I get a very good clean shave with barely any stubble left.</li>
    <li> This is my first safety razor. I&#x27;ve always used disable razors before. This razor provides an excellent shave. I&#x27;me very happy with my purchase and don&#x27;t plan on getting back to disposables.</li>
    <li> One of the best razors that I used in my high quality German industry and the excellent performance of the same brand and I recommend them strongly</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m half black, it stopped me from getting bumps</li>
    <li> My wife bought this for me in 2013. It&#x27;s 5/29/2015, I am still using it, and I love it!. I previously used Gillete&#x27;s Mach 3 Turbo, but there were parts of my face the Mach 3 razor wasn&#x27;t shaving well. Now that I have the Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor I now get a close shave, every time.  This product is also very budget friendly. Think about how often you&#x27;re buying razors. My wife bought this along with Astra Platinum Double Edge Safety Razor Blades in 2013. This box comes with 100 blades. I haven&#x27;t spent any money on razors yet.  Great product. Close shave. and economic.</li>
    <li> Wonderful, the perfect shave. This razor is definitely a Ferrari of razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely sensitive skin and this razor provides a clean and non-irritating shaving experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extremely satisfied!</li>
    <li> Everything one wants in a safety razor including a German made first blade. Much, much cheaper than the multi-blade US razors and blades last longer and stay sharper.</li>
    <li> Now that I switched to safety razors instead of those cruddy Wal-Mart BIC ones, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever go back.</li>
    <li> Nice razor made with stainless steel. Your milage with it will vary depending on what razor blades you get, but it is built to last.</li>
    <li> I have a very coarse beard that may be made of steel wool instead of hair and using a high end cartridge razor was getting very expensive.  I read a few articles about the resurgence of single safety razors and the Merkur 180 had by far the best price/value ratio.  Better yet, razor bumps and irritated skin became a thing of the past because I was unknowingly sensitive to the lubricating strips on the cartridge type razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get a good handle like this and some great blades like Feather platinum or Merkur Super and use your every day shaving cream you will be happier and more kissable!</li>
    <li> I like the long handle and would recommend this product to any man that is looking for a quality product for shaving.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m no expert with DE shaving. But so far I really like this merkur. Does the job well. Is simple to operate and seems very sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a beginner, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the product. The old mach 3 is jealous.</li>
    <li> Works great.  You cannot even find these types of razors or blades in the stores here in the US.  The big shaving company have done a good job of controlling the sale of these.  And they charge so much compared to what it costs to shave with one of these.  Have not nicked myself yet.  Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I really liked this razor. Till it broke... I&#x27;ve had it for years now but only just recently started using it. Today I noticed the tip of the handle metal split and the threaded tapered end came out. Very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to try my 37c again and see if I can use it daily. Otherwise I&#x27;m debating a muhle or Edwin Jagger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle length on this is very long. Which is good. But its very thin. I&#x27;d prefer the shorter heavier handle on the 34/37. They both look a little beafier and felt like they were made a little better but in the end look like they could break just like this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Could have just been a freak accident. Not really sure how it happened.</li>
    <li> Best razor I have ever used. I have upgraded from those cheapy plastic Gillette disposable razors and it has been a joy. I actually look forward to shaving again. Gets me nice and close and no more razor burn. I shave both my face and my head. There is a learning curve for this being I have used disposable blades for the last decade at least. My first shave I nicked my adam&#x27;s apple. second shave nicked the back of my neck when I went to shave my head. Third shave no problems. After that only issue I ran in to was time. When you first switch it takes longer to shave as you are not used to the angling but as you practice it goes faster with every shave. When you first use this blade it will take about twice the amount of time. But as you use it it will even out. I used to use the Gillette two blade disposable on my face and head. This razor gets much closer than any plastic razor I have used Gillette, Bic, or otherwise. The blades I got are $12 bucks for 100 blades so It should last about two years compared to the four cartridge Gillette for $20 bucks which last a month at best. Stop throwing your money away. Shave like your Grandpa!</li>
    <li> I liked mine a lot and my wife tried it.... she then wanted one for herself!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m enjoying shaving again. Best razor. Bought double edged blades as well.. Actually find I am getting a better shave than with triple bladed razors.</li>
    <li> Getting back to basics and saving money at the same time.  I don&#x27;t think my old Safety Razor from the 60&#x27;s ever shaved as nicely as the Merkur does.  I bought a hundred pack of assorted blades to try out and each blade is lasting a week before you can tell is isn&#x27;t new.  That is $13 a YEAR for razor blades and the experience is much nicer than with some cheezy plastic-handled expensive razor.  Do yourself a favor and pick up one of these well-made razors.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent razor.  I thought it would be a difficult and harsher shave than with a more common razor.  The handle is not as long as the title would lead you to believe, but it&#x27;s not a negative thing for me.  Shaving is easy with this and quite intuitive.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I love my safety razor. It took a few weeks to get use to it as opposed to the disposables that I&#x27;ve been using for years. It&#x27;s easy to clean and pays for itself because I only change the blade once a week. I don&#x27;t shave on the weekends. Using a safety razor is something every man should do once in their lives. I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
    <li> Unlike the razors I am used to where you turn the shaft to open the blade area this one required you to screw off the top. PITA!</li>
    <li> First time using a safety razor and I do not know what took me so long to make the change. The razor is everything the description says and I could not be more satisfied.</li>
    <li> Excellent shave. Well made. Seems a bit heavy--will take some getting used to.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s a reason I have one of these and bought three for Christmas presents this year.  It works well, the three piece architecture is much better than the screw butterfly version that my Parker uses.  My Merkur is never loose like my Parker 99 started getting.  Nice baseline safety razor.</li>
    <li> Very comfortable.  Has good weight to it.  Easy to clean as well.  I prefer it to the multiblade razors as it gives a much closer shave.  Takes a little bit of time to get used to it.  The first few times it takes a while to shave but eventually you figure out all the angles and can shave pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> I like this razor a lot. You can shave as close as you</li>
    <li> Excellent razor, shave very good.</li>
    <li> Works well have had a few...</li>
    <li> I have been shaving with this razor for eight months.  It is my first DE razor.  Previously, I had been using disposable Mach 3s.  This model is the Merkur 180, also known as the Merkur 23C.  In combination with Feather blades this razor gives me a very smooth shave with very little to no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The technique you use with a DE razor is important.  I shave in three passes, once down, once up, and then 90 degrees along my jaw line and upper part of my neck.  I lather my face between each pass.  This sounds like it would take a long time, but it really doesn&#x27;t.  I do not press the razor against my face; I only use the weight of the razor.  I shave in the shower and use Proraso Green Preshave, Proraso Green shaving cream (in the tube), and a silvertip badger brush.  I follow up with Proraso White after shave cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the last eight months the Merkur has held up great and I have not had any problems with the screw coming lose or the chrome finish flaking off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something that I did learn is that the TSA does not allow safety razor blades in carry-on luggage.  Because of this, when I travel by air, I leave my Merkur at home and travel with a Mach 3 disposable.  If TSA sees the razor, they will search your bag for blades.  If you check your bag, instead of carry-on, you should be okay.  Every time I travel I am reminded of how superior the Merkur is to the Mach 3.</li>
    <li> I like this razor a lot.  In all the years of shaving the only razor I would pick over this one was an adjustable that I had over 45 years ago.  I like the adjustable feature, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find a replacement.  Overall good price and results with the Merkur.</li>
    <li> This is my first foray into the world of DE razors. After doing some research I decided to pair this up with the Feather platinum coated blades. The combo is excellent. I have a full head of hair that I decide to shave about once a week and let me tell you it is an utter joy to do it with this razor. I used to use a multi made Gillette cartridge which not only left me with razor burn but cost me a pretty penny as well. For the cost of 8 cartridge blades I now have a great razor, 50 blades that will last me two years or more, and some HeadSlick shaving cream too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five stars for me. I have already spread the love and bought 4 additional razors for friends and family. Simple to use, precision made, and great value too.</li>
    <li> Built to last, excellent product!</li>
    <li> It is a great razor but the handle is a little short but I have gotten use to it.</li>
    <li> Very happy, worth every penny</li>
    <li> Best shave I ever had. So much better than the cheap disposable razors.</li>
    <li> Expected to twist the handle so a butterfly like hatch would open to safely change the blade like I did with cheaper models. Not the case with this model. You have to take the whole thing apart to replace the blade which is much more dangerous and cumbersome. Really surprised something at this price point is designed this way. It definitely detracts from the value and makes changing the blade much more dangerous and unnecessarily complicated. Despite the extra hassle and money spent, the closeness of the shave isn&#x27;t any superior to cheaper razors that use the same type of blade,</li>
    <li> Wish I would&#x27;ve known about these years ago. Just as good, if not better than the multi-bladed razors of today, but so much cheaper. Can&#x27;t figure out how this type of razor fell out of style.</li>
    <li> love it getting used to shaving with a DE shaver... Getting better at everyday</li>
    <li> Perfect starter or lifetime user razor handle. No complaints. Easy to clean as it comes apart into 3 pieces. This is a great Razor!</li>
    <li> Perfect fit for my hand and face.</li>
    <li> Nice and heavy, nice construction. No need to buy cheap-y disposables anymore :)</li>
    <li> I love this thing! So much cheaper than disposable plastic heads and shaves smooth. It&#x27;s a bit different to use but don&#x27;t be scared, be careful and you&#x27;ll get the hang of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great product I wish I found years ago.</li>
    <li> Great razor, nice heavy feel. Hair and shave soap clears easily with a quick rinse</li>
    <li> Not as expensive as regular razors</li>
    <li> This razor has a good weight to it so it is very easy to use.</li>
    <li> This is my go to daily razor, I can shave every day and not have an issue.</li>
    <li> Needed to save money on razors. This is the BEST!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve shaved with this razor about 10 times. I&#x27;ve used the razor that had come with it and the &amp;#34;feather&amp;#34; blades. This is well built and solid. However I have never used anything else to compare to.</li>
    <li> Ever since I began shaving with a safety razor, my face and neck have been very happy. The shaving experience is so much closer than your average cheap shaving system. I highly recommend upgrading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: It takes time to adjust your shaving routine. You may cut yourself a few times at first, but trust me when I say that you won&#x27;t regret using a safety razor.</li>
    <li> Everything went perfect</li>
    <li> So far I have enjoyed using this razor.  Having always been leary of using a double edge razor, for safety reasons, I was quite surprised to find that this razor is really easy to use.  Keeping in mind that the angle of the razor to the head, and pressure you use is paramount to a good clean shave.  As the hair folicle grows in every which direction on the skull, I have to go over and over areas in different directions.  with only a single blade it is not causing burn or bumps, and shaves close.  satisfied.</li>
    <li> So glad that I switched to this razor from the two brands that greedily dominate the shaving market. My annual shaving costs are a fraction of what I used to spend on those 3 and 4 blade cartridges. This single, double-sided blade gives me a shave equal or better than I got with those 4-blade cartridges. I feel bamboozled for having been a mindless zombie to those two companies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enough with the politics. This razor is going to last me decades. There seems to be no reason to ever replace it. It is sturdy and durable. The handle is slightly shorter than I expected, but I got used to it quickly and seems appropriate. The handle is comfortable and the grip is non-slip. Replacing the blade is easy (and cheap).  After having used this for a year, the razor still seems brand new. I wish I had bought this earlier in my adult life.</li>
    <li> Great double-edge razor.  I have been shaving with a double-edge razor for about 3 months now and have noticed that the Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor is much easier to shave with than the first double-edge razor I purchased.  The original double-edge I purchased costed $10 and was some generic no name brand.  While it got me used to shaving with a safety razor, I realized I would cut my self quite often.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if this was because I was a novice safety razor shaver or because I purchased a low-quality razor.  After using the Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor for about a month now, I can firmly say most of my cuts were due to the low qualify razor.  I would highly recommend the Merkur brand of safety razors to anyone, especially new beginners to shaving with a safety razor as it has made my switch from cartridge razor to safety razor a smoother transition. I would also recommend the following shaving items when using a safety razor; RazoRock Alum Block Bar (for post shaving to treat the skin and seal any cuts), a pre-shave oil (usually an essential oil to apply to you skin before adding shaving soap or cream), a badger brush, witch hazel (used post shave to close up the pores), shaving soap or cream (not the canned stuff), and a good quality after shave lotion.  You may also want to get a stand and bowl for the badger brush.</li>
    <li> Not sure what else to say that has not already been said about this razor. I will never use a multi-layered blade again. Also, as others have stated this is NOT a fast shaving razor. Once you get your technique down though, you should be able to move a little quicker.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend using a high quality shaving soap (Proraso, etc..). The only thing that caught me was how short the handle is. I do not have big hands, but it took a few minutes to get used to it. I also was not expecting the short handle with the name &amp;#34;Long Handled..&amp;#34;, but regardless this razor is still ace&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> The blade that it comes with is ok for a couple of shaves ... after that it loses it sharpness.  I suggest Derby and/or Feather blades.  The weight is perfect.  The handle just the right size.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product.  They delivered the product on time and as expected.</li>
    <li> Everytime my husband uses it, he cuts himself, I mean, really, he hates it, and he told me that he never will use it on his face again. Oh, well, I guess I got a new razor to shave my legs, I may need to practice a little, otherwise I will get cuts all over my legs, kkkkkkkk.</li>
    <li> This razor is solidly build, holds the blade a just the right angle and gives the best shave I have had in years.  I tried a cheaper model before this one and was very disappointed with the cheap construction.  The cost of this razor is about 1/3 what I used to spend for multi-blade throw away razors and gives me a better shave.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This looks nice sitting on my bathroom basin but it is actually a very low quality item  looks good as a nostalgic shaver from the past and that&#x27;s all folks</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve never used this razor before, it will take some practice.  But once you get the hang of it, (it took me about two weeks and a couple YouTube videos) it will give you your best shave yet. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this razor. I bough it for her when she started to use mine. She has never had a closer shave. We use it with Feather blades.</li>
    <li> Everything is as advertised, I have found no faults with the product. The balance between the head and the handle is excellent.</li>
    <li> I think as a first-time user of a double edge razor this was a great build &amp; inexpensive relative to the competition. A year later and it&#x27;s starting to show signed of wear and tear (internal rusting, although this could be due to the fact I&#x27;ve left this in the shower for a number of weeks at a time)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, fits all razor blades I&#x27;ve bought and has served me well enough. Would recommend a chrome one if you&#x27;re for something with a longer shelf-life</li>
    <li> I have a shorter handled variety I use when I travel and had never really paid attention to ensuring I got the correct angle of the blade to my face. When I got this one my first couple of shaves were worse than I was expecting for a safety razor. Since it was the same blade I figured it must be something with the construction. The next time I was on the road I figured out that how I held the razor with the extra handle length was what was causing my dissatisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why 4 stars? I don&#x27;t like having to push on the side of the head to disassemble. My travel one I twist the nut at the end of the handle which seems safer than pushing in next to the blade.</li>
    <li> My husband got tired of buying razors and blades and decided to go straight blades.  He loves this razor and the blades that came with it. I like it too because it gives a much smoother shave and no five clock shadow by three in the afternoon.  Make sure you get the stand to go with it and the whole shaving kit.  It makes a difference in your man&#x27;s shave!!</li>
    <li> This is the best razer I have ever owned a lot better than the disposable razers. If you are looking for a good razor that gives a good shave this is it.</li>
    <li> I learned to shave with a razor like this one. Then along came the disposal razors that morphed into multiple blades &amp; aloe strips &amp; of course, high prices. I decided to buy this to see if the old school method was better &amp; not only is it superior but it is a way better &amp; closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the Shark blades &amp; it has proven out to be far more economical than the disposable blades. So, no more plastic Gillette razors filling the landfill.</li>
    <li> Performed quite well. Excellent value for the money.</li>
    <li> An excellent design with great ease and comfort of shaving.  The razor is simple to disassemble, and easy to clean after shaving.  The size and weight allow it to hold heat well, which for me results in a more comfortable shave.  I wouldn&#x27;t change a thing!</li>
    <li> My husband wanted one of these for a while, but once he had this (with a sample variety of razors, also from Amazon), he disliked it and now it just collects dust. He says it gives a poor shave, though some razor brands are better than others. He says modern man added extra blades for a reason.</li>
    <li> My first ever experience with a safety razor occurred in 1989 while I was in the Army. One weekend, I wanted to shave and, having no disposable razors left, my roommate let me borrow his safety razor with a new DE blade. When done, I felt as though someone had run a weed eater over my face and I thought I was going to bleed to death through the many cuts on my face. Not to worry, though, my roommate gave me a styptic pencil and some “soothing” after shave to fix me up. At that point, I no longer felt as though I had shaved with a weed eater. Instead, that feeling transitioned into feeling like being repeatedly slapped in the face with a red hot wire whisk.  I couldn’t understand why someone would subject themselves to this unholy facial treatment designed by demons from the depths of hell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many years have passed and I have seen many people successfully shaving in this manner although I felt it to be a pretentious way to groom one’s self. A couple of months ago, an article on a website caught my eye and, out of curiosity, I started researching peoples experience with this shaving “art form”. The clincher that caused me to seriously consider using a safety razor were some articles and posts about re-creating the smell of an old-fashioned barber shop.  The Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor was one of the purchases I made in my quest for the barber shop experience at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first shave with this razor was with the included Merkur blade. Using pre-shave oil and Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood soap applied with a Poraso brush (hastily bought from the drugstore because I forgot to purchase this important piece), I began my first DE safety razor shave since that fateful day in 1989.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I have to say that the experience was much more satisfying than I anticipated. Being a bit gun-shy, I placed the razor with such light pressure on my face that I doubted that it would even do anything at all. This razor has a nice heftfor me so even laying it on my face lightly was an exercise in will power. Surprisingly, after the first pass, I had a clean swipe down my cheek. It took me several minutes as I was trying to be extremely careful but when finished, I was clean shaven. The end result were three nicks and the aftershave I chose felt good and burned only on the three nicked areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All subsequent shaves have been with a Derby blade using the same care and technique. The result has been no nicks at all and a smooth, clean shave. I have since continued with this set up going on two full weeks now and I am surprisingly happy with my new routine. My only hiccup was lopping off part of a small mole low on my neck because I got a bit too cocky. I now believe that you have to respect the razor at all times in order to keep it from biting you. The concentration, it seems, is part of the routine and ritual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my extensive research, I chose this three piece razor as I am skeptical about the butterfly opening style of razor securing the blade properly. This is probably in my head and, as I get more comfortable with my routine, perhaps I will try one. In the meantime, I am perfectly happy with this razor. I can physically tighten the parts to my satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I have nothing to complain about and I suppose even a thank you is in order for helping me get past my fear of the safety razor and I now look forward to my shaving experience each morning.</li>
    <li> Short and sweet...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great razor for the money. Heavy duty, works well, classic design. Very easy to change razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Nice weight and feel in the hand. I have not had any issues with this razor and has met my needs as a safety razor convert.</li>
    <li> Best shave in years ! I learned to shave with a safety razor, wish I had never stopped using one.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist told me that I should get a razor like the one my grandfather would&#x27;ve own. So it was either a safety razor or a knife. Because I&#x27;m clumsy, I feared for my life if I used a knife, so I went with the safety razor instead. It gives me no irritation and the whole process feels great. I actually feel like a grown man using this type of razor. No more cartridges for me.</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because the product did not give me a close shave at all. The metal was lightweight. I would not recommend this product to anyone with facial hair. I wanted to cut down on the amount of razors I used and hopefully save some money, it didn&#x27;t happen. I have a thick beard, trust me on this one.</li>
    <li> For years I have wanted to go to a double edge razor. I just didn&#x27;t step out of my comfort zone until now. This is NOT like shaving with those 4 or 5 blade units. Once you learn the technique (EASY TO LEARN), ONE pass and my face is smooth. I LOVE it. This is a very high quality product. The weight gives it a feel of substance and quality, I will NEVER go back to any other shaving method. OH, I use shaving soap with a brush to apply, I would recommend others to do the same. Shaving has become a few minutes just for me in the morning.</li>
    <li> I looked at a lot of different options for safety razors, and was worried I would make the wrong choice, but I was very happy when this razor came in the mail. It has a nice weight to it, looks cool, feels durable, and gives you a good shave. If you are looking for your first safety razor this is a good one.</li>
    <li> Like almost everyone else, I was sick of paying through the nose for gillette cartridge replacement blades and decided to give DE shaving a try.  I read into it a little bit and went with the extremely well reviewed middle of the road priced Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor.  I have been VERY happy with my decision.  Perhaps it was just my shaving technique before, but I have not needed to adjust my style at all.  Nor have I experienced any discomfort or extra nicks.  Granted I have only been using it for a month, but I have been very impressed with the results.  I will never go back to replacement cartridge blades again.  I paired it with the 100 ct box of Astra DE blades and they have worked very well.  I shave every other day, and 2 weeks on a single razor seemed to work just fine.  Although, since bulk DE razors are so cheap, I really wouldn&#x27;t feel bad just replacing the blade after only a few shaves.  Very economical, but it also looks classy.  The &amp;#34;long&amp;#34; handle really only makes this razor roughly the same size as a Fusion or Mach 3, but I like the size very much.  It fits very comfortably in the hand and the beveled grip is great even when it&#x27;s wet.  No slipping whatsoever.  Great buy, I would and have been recommending it to everyone.  I only wish I had jumped on this bandwagon years ago.</li>
    <li> This is a really remarkable razor.  I am a woman and it works great on the legs and under arms.  Just some advice, be very, very careful the first couple times you use it and go slowly. Since the razor has some weight to it you don&#x27;t need to push down and since it is a single blade razor, very sharp.  Just take your time and break it in so to speak.  I did a video review on youtube and here is the link:  [..]</li>
    <li> After purchasing many of the 3 to 5-blade disposable razors available today, i was somewhat disappointed They were pretty easy to use, but were costing me a fortune. After much internet research, I decided to purchase this Merkur razor (and some Merkur blades) here on Amazon. Now, I&#x27;m just in my teenage years, so I&#x27;m not that experienced with shaving yet, but I just used this for the first time yesterday and it was the best shaving experience I&#x27;ve had thus far! When used with some hot water, Barbasol, and a good aftershave, as well as a little finesse, this razor will provide for one of the easiest, cleanest shaves you&#x27;ve had in a while (until a straight razor - but that&#x27;s for another day)! Don&#x27;t be deterred by reviewers saying this razor is really hard to use or is really dangerous! Sure, you can cut yourself with it, but after looking at a couple of internet articles and videos, I was confident and had a great shave. This price might seem high for a single razor, but trust me, it isn&#x27;t. You can immediately tell when you hold it that it&#x27;s solid, well-crafted, and simple. It&#x27;s just 3 parts in total (not including the blade itself), and it&#x27;s easy as pie to use. Just one of these blades (whether from Merkur or somewhere else, I haven&#x27;t tried anything else yet) will last you for a few shaves at least, and they&#x27;re sold for dirt-cheap here on Amazon or at your local drugstore! All in all, I highly recommend this razor to shavers of any skill level.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. The model&#x27;s extra weight allows the user to apply less pressure than its multi-bladed counterparts, resulting in a smooth, comfortable and ultra-enjoyable shaves with less irritation and fewer nicks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for almost two weeks and it is my first DE razor. It is much easier and safer to use than I expected. The finish is beautiful and the shave is comfortable and close. I use it on my head too, and it has been very easy to use even on the back of my head where I can&#x27;t see.  No nicks so far but I do take my time.  I will most likely but an adjustable Merkur once I get the hang of DE shaving to get more control of how aggressive I want to shave.  But I would definitely continue to use this razor for years to come.</li>
    <li> I found very few reviews by women using this safety razor. You would think with our beauty routines we would buy a more eco-frenidly and money saving method to shaving. Anyway...I finally used this razor on my legs the other day and it worked great! I was a bit nervous at first, since I heard how one must have a light touch when shaving or you will cut yourself. No problems here- it was a breeze. Definitely would recommend this razor for any gender. Its a perfect fit in my hands and i have no issue with its long handle or weight. SMART BUY!</li>
    <li> I have been shaving for at least three decades.  I have a thick beard that an electric won&#x27;t even touch.  I have tried most of the multi-bladed wonder razors and was never satisfied.  I had been reading on double edge razor shaving for a few months and finally decided to take the plunge with this razor.  To say that I am impressed is an understatement.  I am literally stunned at how much more improved my shaving experience has been.  One blade really does shave better than 3 or more.  Both with the supplied blade and with Personna Red this razor has performed flawlessly.  Whereas before I would still feel the stubble and look unshaven in short order, my face is now smooth after a shave with only light stubble after most of the day.  Originally chosen as a compromise between price and quality to see if I liked double edge shaving, the razor itself is well constructed and sturdy.  It is everything I could ask for.  My experience so far is with this razor, the above mentioned blades, a Tweezerman badger brush and Taylor of Old Bond shave cream.  I will be experimenting with other blades and shave creams/soaps in the future.</li>
    <li> This razor makes me enjoy shaving! I know that sounds a little over the top but honestly one of the best purchases I have made in awhile. I also got the Proraso shaving cream and the Clubman Pinaud after shave and I can honestly say that it has been the best shaving experience I have ever had. Easy to use with no razor burn or cuts!</li>
    <li> This razor works beautifully, and gives a much closer shave than the N-blade cartidges I had been using. I have had no problems with cuts or ingrown hairs. I also got the Proraso Shaving Soap and the Escali Badger brush, which work well. Plus, the warm foam feels better on the skin than regular shaving gel.</li>
    <li> Great DE razor wasnt sure if I was gonna stick with this type of shaving system so this wasnt one of my first choices.Came off lower price unit from Egypt. This was my second step up from that unit and I feel that this razor is worth the every penny,very pleased</li>
    <li> Perfect Razor. I will never buy a Mach 3 blade again. It is soooo much better to shave with and the blades are super cheap! One of those cases where the old way is the better way. The only way I would give this up is if I start using a straight razor.</li>
    <li> Every men should have one of this.&lt;br /&gt;Sturdy, great looking, and going to save me money over the long term.</li>
    <li> After years of being trapped in the madness of 3,4,5 blade cartridges and their ridiculous prices, I took a look at double-edged, single razor solutions.  I&#x27;m hooked! I just picked up a 2 year supply of blades for less than $20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Merkur razor is lovely. Nice weight, and if you hold it under hot running water for a few seconds, it gets nice and warm--and STAYS warm.</li>
    <li> Have been a Gillette Mach3 user for years.  The shave was good but hated the high prices for the cartridges.  Decided to give this a try.  It is definitely a superior shave and experience.  Yes, it does take a bit longer to shave, like maybe 25% longer.  Yes, I have cut myself a few times but I cut myself with the Gillette Mach3 razor when I wasn&#x27;t careful.  Just like with the Gillette razor, I start going with the grain (downward) then switch to against the grain (upward) on the sides of my face to get a really close shave.  I use Proraso shaving soap and a badger bristle brush as I have done for years.  The Persona blades work well and at around $15 for a 100 blades lasting a week per blade are a great value.  Overall, the closeness of the shave and feel of the razor in the hand are top notch.  It is difficult to shave really close under the nose and close to the ears.  I touch up those few spots with the Gillette Mach3 or a Gillette disposable.  Love the razor and experience and am glad to say goodbye to Gillette high prices for cartridges.</li>
    <li> I actually enjoy shaving now. I have heavy facial hair and this razor shaves smoother and more comfortably than any Mach 5 or other ridiculous adaptation. Replacement razors as cheap as 11 cents and I am shaving even on my days off. No cuts or burn. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> Works as expected, looks nice.  Would like to try out the shorter version at some point.</li>
    <li> Husband loves this razor. Said he&#x27;s a permanent convert. Win!</li>
    <li> My husband loves this razor.  Says it the best one he has used in a very long time.  Will certainly be ordering more.</li>
    <li> I used to get really bad razor bumps. I tried every combination of Gillette razors as well as an electric razor and they all failed. Finally I read an article that the best razor is old school - a single-edge blade. Sure enough, I tried this and it was perfect. I can&#x27;t believe there&#x27;s an entire industry of razor blade makers selling these 2 and 3 edge blades that are not only WORSE for your skin, but bad for the environment with all the plastic blade casings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the one razor you should have - go old school and don&#x27;t look back...  :)</li>
    <li> This is a great DE razor. A must need for any gentleman. Gives a close shave and disassembles in 5 seconds.</li>
    <li> a good switch from expensive disposable razor. but really need the cream for shaving, if not safety razor will cause irritation on my skin.</li>
    <li> This shaver is great, it&amp;#34;s the closest shave I have ever had. I bought the soap style shaving cream and didn&#x27;t cut myself the first three times. I decided to use in a can shaving cream to see the difference, a few small cuts. I recommend getting the professional style soap. The shaver is set to the perfect angle. Had a bit of trouble getting right under my nose, but getting better with practice. To use this shaver it&#x27;s best to use a slower stroke. Always have your skin wet with this shaver. Bye Bye expensive replacement heads for the 3 blade ones. I love shaving now, takes a bit more time, but well worth it.</li>
    <li> I read all the great reviews on this razor and decided to purchase.  It does give a SMOOTH shave...but NOT a CLOSE shave. It barely took the hair off.  I did a few passes and immediately switched back to my 5 blade.  It was much better than this razor.  Save yourself the money.</li>
    <li> After watching a few instructional videos on shaving with a safety razor, I took a deep breath and started shaving. I soon found out shaving with a safety razor is as easy as shaving with any popular models on the market today. No cuts, no nicks, and the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had. With absolutely no irritation and no shave bumps. Do yourself a favor, throw away your Gillette or Schick, and&lt;br /&gt;stop getting financially raped by these companies who&#x27;s commercials claim superior quality. Try a Merkur, and like me you will &amp;#34;join the dark side&amp;#34; and never go back to expensive disposable razors again!</li>
    <li> This bad boy changed they way I approach life...no kidding.  Slowing things down a little to enjoy them fully is a new passion of mine.  Also, the razor delivers everything you need for a quality DE shave.  I plan on using this for my entire remaining life.  Get one.</li>
    <li> Never thought I&#x27;d use a razor to shave again. Really great to alleviate razor bumps. Nice clean shave w/o paying the barber to do it.</li>
    <li> I have long searched for a better shave. Being someone who has a thick beard, I often found those five blade cartridges dulling quickly and cleaning out my wallet better than cleaning up my face. That said, this is an excellent, high quality safety razor. Price is attractive, it is easy to use and has nice weight to it. Best part is, you can change the blades frequently, and replacement blades are very inexpensive (you can buy a 100 pack on Amazon for less than $10). Overall, you get a great shave and you won&#x27;t regret this purchase.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try out double edge Razor and the result was just............. bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Razor will cut your skin most of times and won&#x27;t give you clean smooth cut either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not waste your Money on this.. I regret that I bought this..</li>
    <li> This is a great razor, it has a great weight to it, feels perfect in your hand. doesn&#x27;t feel cheaply made, or too light. I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> My wife purchased one of these razors for me over 10 years ago and I still use it today. It has saved me a ton of cash on razors. I purchased this one for a friend and he loves it too. These razors will save you a ton of money.</li>
    <li> My first metal razor, and I will never return to the dark side of plastic razors!  The weight of it in my hand and on my face means I don&#x27;t have to push or tug to get a close shave.  Therefore I have little to no razor burn.  I usually lather up a couple times to get all the whiskers, but it does the job better than any modern-style razor I&#x27;ve owned.  I&#x27;ll be sticking with this for a good long time!</li>
    <li> This works as stated.  Had to figure out how you take the blade out.  The handle unscrews where it attached to the blade.  it is a well made and sturdy.  Worth the extra money.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know  why this razor is described as &amp;#34;Long Handled&amp;#34; , the length is slightly shorter than other razors I have. I tried the blades they enclosed and a number of other blades from different manufacturers. It gives a decent shave, but nothing exceptional.</li>
    <li> Love this razor.  So easy to use, hardly any cuts compared to my old Mach 3 Turbo.  I use Astra blades, pack of 100 for 10 bucks.  Huge money saver and now my wife wants one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this thing</li>
    <li> First off. Do not be afraid of this new shaving method. It is easy and I have only used my new shaver for about a week. Basically if you do something that would leave 5 parallel cut on your face with a mach junk razor you would cut yourself with this. Be careful and you won&#x27;t cut yourself AT ALL. I didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second. This is bar none the best shave of my life. No irritation at all. It glides through longer whiskers when its been a few days. It cleans with a nice quick rinse unlike the new age stuff. Smooth as can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this with barbasol, a badger brush, and the old classic aqua velva.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely amazing. If you have been thinking about it do it now!</li>
    <li> I started using a double edge razor earlier this year and after reading many reviews, I decided to start with this razor.  I have made the right decision.  Sure, it may not be the most expensive or fanciest razor out there, but it does everything you expect a razor to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are about to start the double edge shaving route - and I highly suggest you do - start and end here.  You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> The construction and finish on this think is excellent. When inserted, blade is even on both sides. I am new to DE razors, so I tried a variety pack of several blades. The head of the Merkur is large. I find it hard for me to get that perfect angle to make constant contact with my face. I have to go over an area several times to get a clean shave. It was still non irritating, unlike a cartridge razor. I just purchased a Parker 99R that has a smaller head and gives me much better results. I still gave it five stars because of the fit and finish. And although it was just adequate for Me, I know it will work better for others.</li>
    <li> The product is well constructed but, do not get into this safety razor thing unless you&#x27;re devoted.  It takes getting used to and is slower (for me) than a disposable razor.  I over-use my disposable razors anyway so the cost benefit isn&#x27;t really there anyway.</li>
    <li> Best handling shaver on the market those Germans are the leaders in machine tech for better than any Jap Crap the local stores sell</li>
    <li> This is my second razor and will probably be my last.  It is amazing how this razor could give such a better shave than others.</li>
    <li> Shipping and delivery was great the razor not so much. I bought for my husband for father&#x27;s day and he wasn&#x27;t impressed with the quality of the razor. Seems strong and sturdy just not enough for his manly scruff.</li>
    <li> I primarily use this to shave my head, works great and the inexpensive blades last. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for the Merkur after more than 20 years using the Atra Plus. The Atra was/is a fantastic razor but the hassle of trying to find replacement blades got to be too much. So I figured a safety razor like the Merkur with readily available replacement blades from a host of suppliers would be just dandy. Not so. It may be that I should have opted for the Merkur without the safety blade protector rake but the fact is I just can&#x27;t get a satisfactory shave from this thing. I&#x27;ve used it now for about 2 months and I&#x27;m really, really unhappy with it. I just cannot get an overall smooth shave. I followed all the recommendations including watching various videos about the correct ways to use it but no joy. First of all it takes me at least three times as long to finish a shave compared to the Atra and even after multiple passes with fresh shaving cream I end up with rough spots and even untouched spots. Arghh! Trying to shave my upper lip or chin just doesn&#x27;t work and trying to get a close shave along the jawbone- fergit it. Last night in frustration I used an Old Spice disposable razor that had been sitting on the shelf unused since I got my Merkur and, lo, I was done in a minute and my face felt great and was smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said earlier, perhaps the problem is the blade rake and maybe one of the Merkur&#x27;s without a rake would work better for me. All I know is I&#x27;m out $34.95 for the razor and I still have over 50 Personna blades unused. For now I will use the Old Spice disposables and look for a source online to get more Atra Super replacements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not happy!</li>
    <li> My Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor has provided me with my best shave in years,in fact the best shave of my life. The long handle ensures perfect control. I fully recommend using only Merkur Safety Razor Blades too ,for the perfect shave experience.&lt;br /&gt;It is so easy to rinse the blade (unlike the disposable razors).I actually look forward to shaving).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I fully recommend using an After Shave Balm for the perfect shaving experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please pass my remarks on the manufacturers of Merkur products.Their product is second to none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My final comment to Merkur  is...... \\&quot;All the best !\\&quot; or,...... \\&quot;Alles gute ! \\&quot; in German.</li>
    <li> I am new to DE shaving and I bought a cheep one at Sallys and liked it , but after getting the Merker 180 now I love DE shaving. Great product will buy another if anything should happen to this one. used the Merkur blade that comes with it . I will have to buy more blades. If your thinking about buying stop just do it you will love it.</li>
    <li> Not only does this product work great but it is affordable! Blades cost minimal! I will never go back to expensive disposable razors ever again.</li>
    <li> But that&#x27;s what real men do.  They shave with early 20th century technology and bang hot chicks!  Anybody got some Old Spice?... and a beer?</li>
    <li> Quality stainless-steel product. Handle unscrews to remove head assembly required to clean accumulated shaving cream from the blade after each use. Facet rinsing will not clean accumulated residue on blade.  Using tissue or cotton Q-Tip does the job.</li>
    <li> I have two three piece razors including one of these.  This one has a very nice weight to it and has done a very good job with most DE blades I&#x27;ve used with it.  It&#x27;s a personal opinion only, but I think that DE blades each have a particular &amp;#34;gauge&amp;#34; to the metal they are made of.  So, some are more flexible than others.  With a razor like this one, I find that the stiffer a blade is, the better job it does; with my other three piece (a very low-budget, lightweight model also available on amazon) the lighter, more flexy blades do better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In either case, you have to be careful when loading these 3 piece razors that you get the blade straight; it is possible for the blade to be misaligned so the edges are not square with the edges of the razor&#x27;s head.  Such a misalignment causes scraping.  If you&#x27;re having scraping issues, check the alignment of your blade and make sure it is straight.</li>
    <li> I tried this because I&#x27;ve been on a mission to save money. Tired of wasting cash on blades, waiting for them to unlock the cabinet at the drugstore, etc. What I found was a superior shave. All it takes is one blade! Couple things I really like... Since the razor is all metal, it gets nice and hot under the tap, also there is more of a gap under the blade, so you can take more strokes, then flip it over and take even more. It&#x27;s easy to rinse as well - no more banging your razor in the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that being said... The cost saving s really delivered. I bought this and the 100 blade pack. Considering I shave twice a week, each razor can easily go 4-5 uses, this set up that cost me 50 bucks will last 50 months!!!! Awesome product. I will stay old school for life with this one.</li>
    <li> This product  its  100% original excellent, I receive before expecting ... It  does the job perfectly smooth shave ..like butter ..but please don&#x27;t use with cheap razor blades.</li>
    <li> My husband is a first time safety razor user, and is very impressed with the size, weight and performance of this razor. He is a big guy (6&#x27;4&amp;#34;, 260 pounds) and this is well balanced for his large mitts. A very simple, elegant design.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on all the reviews that were positive but the more i read the more I think they are fake. I always shaved with my edwin jagger and thought i got a very good shave when I finally developed the learning curve to it. This Merkur on the other hand is awful. First off only one side actually shaved.. the other side is way to short and just glides across the skin cutting barely any hair. The part that actually does cut hair does it no justice as you have to make multiple passes with it to get a semi smooth shave. Also, compared to the edwin jagger this razor is very light and doesn&#x27;t feel to heavy duty. Ill stick with my edwin jagger and throw this one out. Very disappointed</li>
    <li> I received this razor as a Christmas gift along with a shaving kit. This is by far the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used, and I highly recommend it. It has a nice weight to it, a simple design, does not get clogged up with hair, and does a better job in 1 pass than my other razor with 4 blades. I&#x27;ve also noticed that I have a lot less irritation on my neck from shaving, but I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s related to the razor or the new shaving lather I&#x27;m using.</li>
    <li> Razor is easy to use and hold while shaving.  I had been trying to get my husband to use something other than a disposable razor for years.  I purchased this as a gift for him this year and he loves it.  We both enjoy the close shave he gets and the overall cost is less as the blades are very cost efficient.</li>
    <li> I was really hesitant about buying this razor.  I was afraid that I was going to cut my face off after reading some of the reviews on amazon.  Let me tell you I was wrong! First off I am a newbie to DE shaving I&#x27;m a fusion proglide with the 5 blades guy. I bought the Merkur razor out of curiosity and I am extremely happy I did. First off this thing gives an amazing shave.  The first time I used it I only had a slight irritation  on my neck area  but that was due to my own fault trying to develop my technic.  I&#x27;m on my 10th shave now no irritation no cuts no nicks and I have the smoothest shave I have ever had in over 30 years.  I use the Art of Shaving and truffet and Hill products and Astra blades a shaving brush I bought at Walgreens and that&#x27;s it.  it does take just a little longer to shave but its not a bad longer its actually relaxing and enjoyable now.  I thank that it will get faster the more I use the razor.</li>
    <li> The blade does not project out long enough to get a close enough shave. Looks great, but does not get the job done. Sorry. I wish I could be refunded for this item. I never, ever wrote a bad review before, this hurts me equally.</li>
    <li> High quality razor.  I may not yet have acquired expertise in its use.  I still prefer my Gillette Fusion ProGlide Manual Razor, which does an equally good job, in less time, and without nicks.</li>
    <li> Double Edge razor fan for 15 years. This razor, out of 10 I have, is simply the best I have ever tried. Excellent quality build ( I am a master craftsman), along with outstanding shaving. Simply the best especially when you see the low price.  Recommend for all from newbies to old time shavers.</li>
    <li> I have now become my father. The kids and music are too loud, my hair is thinning and I am now using a safety razor. At least something is right. Buy this razor!!! Shaving has become a pleasure and my face feels great all day. The fusion blades are costly and i didn&#x27;t realize that my face was always irritated by them. My shaving is now an event and love it. Change your shaving habits and enjoy yourself.</li>
    <li> I started looking for old-fashioned safety razors due to the irritation and razor burn I got from traditional disposable razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking for info on the web, I found several reviews of people recommending safety razor as a suitable replacement for the plastic ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just received my Merkur yesterday and I am totally satisfied with the product. It looks and feels solid, the materials are top quality and my skin feels totally great after shaving. You just have to be sure of using a quality shaving lather and a good after-shave product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely reccomend safety razors, and certainly this one in particular.</li>
    <li> Love it. It comes with 1 Merkur blade (very nice sharp blade) I wish it had more than 1 blade with it.</li>
    <li> Easy to use!  I was a little nervous coming from a disposable, but I can say with confidence that this was a great move.  I&#x27;m not cut, I&#x27;m not bleeding and I&#x27;m not afraid of using this.  Even with just running water. It gives the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had, it&#x27;s affordable and it doesn&#x27;t clog.  I&#x27;m never going back. Don&#x27;t overthink it, just make the move.</li>
    <li> Having used a two edged razor from the start of my shaving career almost 60 years ago; I have to say this razor and accompanying generous supply of superb Wilkinson Blades is a great value.</li>
    <li> I have been sick of five, four and three blade shavers for years. When you hold this razor, you know it&#x27;s not cheaply made. Classic design for a classic man!</li>
    <li> This razor coupled with Astra blades is a perfect combination.  Definitely as good as any razor I&#x27;ve used. After three weeks I&#x27;m still surprised.</li>
    <li> This is a sturdy, well made razor.  It took awhile to get use to the overall weight of the razor as far as handling, but after a few weeks of shaving there&#x27;s been no issues. Quality shave everytime and even greater value by switching to safety blades!</li>
    <li> For the shaving enthusiast, this is the gold standard of shavers.  Not some super expensive piece of bathroom art.  A solid built well balanced shaver.  The best there is, and yes it does make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and buy the Merkur blades to use with it.  They will give you the smoothest shave out there!</li>
    <li> I just recently got into DE shaving and it has changed my life! I have converted several other buddies of mine as well as my wife (for her legs). I own this razor as well as a 1970&#x27;s Gillette Black Beauty adjustable razor. The Merkur 180 is heavy and built with fine quality. The shave you can get from this razor is amazing! I would recommend it to anyone looking to save money down the road on blades and looking to get a perfect shave without any irritation.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a broken Edwin Jagger DE89, and there&#x27;s so little space between the blade and guard that I can&#x27;t get anything even close to approximating a close shave. No good. Replaced with a Parker 92R.</li>
    <li> Great product!&lt;br /&gt;All Pros, no cons!&lt;br /&gt;I never really considered a safety razor until 3 months ago. I was using the disposable kind with multi-razor capabilities. I really thought that technology gave me a good until I inherited the Merkur Model 180. Long handle fits big hands like mine. It’s a bit heavier than your average safety razor (this is my third try at them). Very smooth shave with very little effort. Remember, this isn’t nowhere close to your average, run of the mill, garden variety razor. The results if instructions are followed properly are flawless. My advice is to watch the video for those who aren’t familiar with this type of razor. Well worth the investment as opposed to disposables. I know I’ll never go back if I can help it. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Excellent Razor.&lt;br /&gt;I waited a week to shave because my previous razor (Gilette Mach 5) was getting dull and continued to nick my face.&lt;br /&gt;It was worth the wait.&lt;br /&gt;The first shave I had with this was the best I&#x27;ve had in a while.&lt;br /&gt;I (honestly) got no nicks and actually enjoyed the shave.&lt;br /&gt;It included a blade for the first use and it was sharp and gave a very smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;It is important to maintain a 45 degree angle between the blade and your face and to take care with your shave.&lt;br /&gt;This way you will not nick yourself so long as you take smooth strokes and do not put much pressure on the razor (the weight of the razor itself is enough to get a good shave).&lt;br /&gt;Then simply wash the blade after each pass and remember to take as many strokes over an area as necessary and shave with the grain not against it to prevent nicks.&lt;br /&gt;It is also worthwhile to pick up a few razor blades when you buy this as they are not as easy to buy as your old razors.&lt;br /&gt;Also perhaps a nice shaving soap and brush.&lt;br /&gt;And maybe even get a little bit excited for your first shave!</li>
    <li> I really appreciate the M.D.C. for recommending this razor in the most helpful review. If I ever have to replace this Merkur I might try an adjustable at the local Art of Shaving store, but honestly I&#x27;d probably just get another one of these, I can&#x27;t see how it can really get much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor comes with 1 Merkur blade. I like the Merkur blade well enough, but I don&#x27;t like the price they want for more of them. No problem, you can use any double-edge safety razor blade you want, and Amazon is full of high rated alternatives -- Lots of them... I recommend anyone considering a large quantity blade purchase to try the blades first (see Sampler below). Reviews cannot help you decide which one will work best FOR YOUR FACE. The Astra blades get gleaming reviews here, but on my face they cut me so badly I had to stop shaving for days just to let my skin heal again. Thanks to a Sampler, I have been able to try out all the blades that have top reviews, in my razor, on my face, and decide for myself. For me and my face, the Feather and BlueBird are clear winners and so the obvious choice now is to get BlueBird because they are cheaper and should last through more shaves as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a Feather in the [[ASIN:B007OL72B8 16 FEATHER DERBY 7 O&#x27;clock ASTRA NACET BIC BLUEBIRD Blade Sampler]] and was just about ready to decide I&#x27;d found my favorite blade. Thanks to another reviewer&#x27;s comment about BlueBird vs Feather, I pulled out one of the BlueBird blades from the Sampler, and I believe it is every bit as good, possibly even better than the Feather! Out of all the blades I&#x27;ve had the least number of nicks with the Feather and the BlueBird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are interested in the rest of the items I use, I prep with hot washcloth, then [[ASIN:B001GV2P3C American Crew Lubricating Shave Oil, 1.7 Ounce]], then I&#x27;ve been trying both [[ASIN:B001JHEY14 Proraso Shave Soap, Sensitive, 150ml/5.2 oz (147 g) Jar]] and [[ASIN:B0012Y1EMQ Palmolive for Men Sensitive Shave cream with Aloe Vera 100ml]]. They work equally well, and are both menthol-cool. The trick is to get enough shave soap and not use too much water, otherwise it&#x27;s too wet and dripping off everywhere as you try to shave. I shake my brush out a couple extra times and then carefully add water a little more at a time if needed after I see how it&#x27;s lathering up, by getting a little more hot water right where the brush meets the handle and then it just \\&quot;drips down\\&quot; the brush into the bowl; the lady at the local Art of Shaving store showed me that trick :-) It takes a little more work to get the more solid Proraso out, and it&#x27;s harder to get a consistent amount on the brush, so when that is gone I will probably stick with the cream like [[ASIN:B00837ZOI0 Proraso Shaving Cream, Eucalyptus &amp; Menthol, 150 ml, New Formulation]]. I use [[ASIN:B002QHYYR0 Edwin Jagger 1ej946sds Traditional English Best Badger Hair Shaving Brush Faux Ebony Medium With Drip Stand, Black, Medium]] cause I just couldn&#x27;t stand to spend more on a silvertip, and it does work well. I just use a large 20 oz teacup bowl thing I grabbed out of the kitchen for my lathering bowl. I finish off with [[ASIN:B000FGVJWW The Art of Shaving After-Shave Balm, Sandalwood Essential Oil, for All Skin Types, Packaging May Vary, 3.4 fl oz (100 ml)]] because it is my favorite smell ever and my wife likes it too.ave cream with Aloe Vera 100ml]].

    <li> I bought this razor after I went to Costco to purchase refills for my high-tech Gilette cartridge razor and realized how much I was spending on razors alone.  This razor, plus 100 blades for it, cost me about $40.  Its kind of fun to use it, since its a different feel than the multi-blade kind, and it does not take long to get used to it.  It has a nice heft to it compared to the disposable plastic razors.  One word of caution - if you rinse the razor with pure hot water when shaving, the head can get very hot, so adjust your water to a hot yet comfortable temperature.</li>
    <li> 1st shave: Extremely close shave, very smooth, no razor bumps, no cuts or nicks.  I was using Feather Platinum coated blades, next time I&#x27;ll try the blade it came with, which was a Merkur Special Platinum coated blade, and the the 7AM platinum blade the third time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m impressed at how safe this safety razor is.  I was expecting atleast a few nicks because this is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used a double-sided safety razor.  It far exceeded my initial expectations, we&#x27;ll see how it holds up for the long haul.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7am platinum blades:  Thank you, you POS, I now have a scar under my eye on my cheekbone about 3/4\\&quot; long and so many nicks and cuts everywhere. I will never ever use a 7am blade again.  I bought a 20 or 30 pack, priced cheap because they suck. I&#x27;m going to be giving them away for free and probably only to my enemies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even the sample Merkur special platinum blade gave me nicks, at least no major ones like the 7am blades did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So out of the blades I got, the feather is the absolute best.  I never get nicks or cuts with a Feather blade.  I know that sounds likes fake person talk, but I still haven&#x27;t cut myself or even nicked myself with their blades.  I only use one shave on each blade, due to the sheer amount of blades I have and currently I&#x27;m sporting a beard, so not too much shaving period.  We&#x27;ll see how the shaver feels after this break from shaving.  I like shaving so much I think I&#x27;m going to go back to a goatee just so I can have some more to shave.</li>
    <li> Review of the Merkur 180 HD and why I prefer the EJ...&lt;br /&gt;I got this to replace the Edwin Jagger DE89Lbl ( 9 is the model year). I have dropped it in the shower a few times (totally my fault) and the head broke off. So I decided that I would try another brand just to see if there is a big difference. Well the Merkur arrived and I have shaved with it twice and it gives a pretty decent shave and the handle is slightly larger with a buckwheat etched handle with a good feel so it doesn&#x27;t slip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me I prefer the Edwin Jagger DE89BA11 Double Edge Safety Razor, Barley Chrome (the 2011 model). In researching the many DE razors out on the market, they also have models that have been updated hence the DE89BA11 because it was updated in 2011 with a slightly different weight distribution in the handle. So the 1st EJ that I bought was a older model DE89Lbl which is a 2009 model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately this info is not always in the product info and when trying to replace the EJ all they have on Amazon is the 09 model year and not the 2011. I had to go out of the Amazon sphere which I found several sites that do have the most current model and was actually a few bucks cheaper. As much as I love Amazon, you still have to do your research.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok... now for the reason I prefer the EJ razor over the Merkur.... the quality and the finish of the EJ is far superior. The chrome is brilliant, and not one flaw on the chrome of the EJ. The Merkur was lighter, but had many blemishes and just not as elegant in my opinion. Yes the Merkur is good, but I cant wait to get my Edwin Jagger DE89BA11 Double Edge Safety Razor, Barley Chrome (the 2011 model) soon. I will use the Merkur as a back up and possibly use to travel with so in case I loose it I still have my Edwin Jagger.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality combined w/ good service! He had wanted to try an &amp;#34;old-fashioned&amp;#34; razor and tells me he&#x27;s had no problems - and MUCH closer shaves!</li>
    <li> LOVE this Razor!!! It shaves as well if not better than the expensive cartridges, the blades are dirt cheap, and with a little technique and the right shaving cream you&#x27;ll be shaving the way your grampa did in no time. I switched to this and haven&#x27;t looked back. If you want to save money and have good style while doing so, i strongly recommend this safety razor. See my other reviews of the Variety pack of blades and the Art of Shaving products for the things you need to get started. It is a little bit of an investment to get it all together, but once you have a good brush, good shaving cream, oil, balm, etc, you&#x27;ll wonder why you didn&#x27;t do this sooner! It doesn&#x27;t take that much more time, and the results are worlds better. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> I made the switch to this razor and double edge blades because I heard and read that it was better for your skin, and because of the cost savings. I am used to using multi-blade cartridges and have been for over 10 years but they always left me with irritation on my neck. I chose this razor specifically because of all I read, this one was reputed to be among the best in terms of build quality and they were all correct. The razor is very well made and feels great in your hand. It does have more of a heft to it than a plastic Gillette so that may take some getting used to. Since switching I have not had any irritation at all. Also don&#x27;t be afraid to make the switch for fear of cutting yourself, I haven&#x27;t cut myself with this razor but I&#x27;ve cut myself with the cartridges. As long as you let the razor do the cutting you&#x27;ll be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, it&#x27;s a very good razor to choose. It&#x27;s made my face feel much better after each shave than the multi-blade cartridges. It&#x27;s a lot cheaper to use this than the replacement cartridge. Make the switch and you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> Do yourself a favor and buy the long-handled one! Great product!  I prefer the astra razors to the others and great price too!</li>
    <li> Well, the title alone should say everything but I&#x27;ll elaborate.  How many of you men have spent hundreds, maybe THOUSANDS of dollars on crap just to get a very unsatisfying shave?  Well, my boyfriend had too so I did some research and found this razor.  He ADORES it and has since invested in shaving soap, Edwin Jagger Best Badger Brush and is now playing with different types of razors (I just got him the Merkur razors to start with).  He actually LIKES to shave now and gets the closest &amp;#34;baby butt&amp;#34; smooth shave on his face and head.  I&#x27;m so glad I got this for him, he thanks me for it every time he shaves.  :)</li>
    <li> It has a good weight to this and any blade fits the razor. It feels solid and has been working great for me since a few weeks.</li>
    <li> Works great this is a little heavy, but I like the feel, was just what I was looking for, and for a great price! Would definitely buy from again, and recommend for anyone else looking for a solid safety razor.</li>
    <li> There aren&#x27;t any bells and whistles, but this razor body gets the job done. Paired with your preferred blade, it provides a smooth, comfortable shave. I like the long handle because I have large hands, and it&#x27;s great for longer strokes. The textured grip means I can hold it lightly in many positions and easily keep hold of the razor.</li>
    <li> Having gotten very tired of the twin blades - the increasingly high cost of blade cartridges being a primary turn-off, I decided to give an old style &amp;#34;safety razor a look. After reading numerous reviews and checking prices I decided upon the Merkur Model 180 from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s been a week or so now. There is a difference. Smoother, closer shaves each time. It is taking a little bit more time to shave and learning how to properly hold the shaver. But it&#x27;s worth the time and I&#x27;m looking forward to many years of using the Mercur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor is easy to hold. It is very well made, with a bit of heft. Easy to clean, too. I picked up the 100 pack of assorted blades available from Amazon. They will probably last me quite a while! I would highly recommend this Merkur 180 razor.</li>
    <li> this is a good razor, it gives a close shave and will last you a life time with the propper care.</li>
    <li> I read a lot about using classic methods for shaving (straight blades and safety razors) and kept looking around. Finally I purchased this product and I&#x27;m really impressed with it. The long handle has good grip to it and it gives an amazing shave. The only thing I have to comment on is the blade does get clogged easily, so after I finish shaving I have to clean it thoroughly. Otherwise, great product and terrific results!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m such a cheapskate. I&#x27;m always interested in little ways to save big money over time and this is one of those ways. I invested in this hardware and Dorco Platinum razors. Now, instead of buying &amp;#34;quattro max teenface&amp;#34; razorblades for $12 a piece I shave for about $15 a year. Boosh!</li>
    <li> Say goodbye to price gouging by Gillette and the rest of them. I find this system works better than the mach3 turbo and the lifetime cost is magnitudes less than being a pawn to Gillette&#x27;s game.</li>
    <li> This is an elegant, simple razor with an excellent heft and feel. The longer handle will likely make it easier for new users to feel comfortable with the different feel of an all-metal safety razor, whereas some of the more old-fashioned \\&quot;classic\\&quot; Merkur designs like the 34c or 1904 might feel unusually small after using the giant modern Mach III&#x27;s and the like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor shaves very smoothly, and the textured grip is easy to hang on to, even with wet soapy hands. Overall, this is an excellent choice, which can easily satisfy beginner and experienced DE shaver alike.</li>
    <li> If you read these reviews, you&#x27;d think many had a transcendent experience. Fact is, anybody who bought this razor was looking for something different and so likely only experienced what they expected to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I bought it for practical reasons. The cost of this razor was not a whole lot more than a pack of replacement blades for my Fusion vibrating razor. Those blades cost $4 a pop and decent safety razor blades are 50 cents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say I had a transcendent experience using it--but can say that it shaves quite satisfactorily. I can say that it shaves me closer than my Fusion did, but I get a good, close shave with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have soft, tender skin--and bleed easily. I have not yet cut myself and do not have any problems with razor scrape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If shaving with it was a transcendent experience, I&#x27;d probably want to stay there and not worry about the time. I do worry about the time, and fact is that I expect when I become fully adept it will take no more than the Fusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have nice heft to it--and I do appreciate its &amp;#34;tool-like&amp;#34; quality as opposed to the Fusion&#x27;s slick, modernistic plastic. Not quite the difference between a fine, folded Japanese knife and a stamped Walmart one, but certainly somewhere in between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually watched my father use a Gillette safety razor--the kind that crank down from a screw on the end of the handle (kind of like gull-wings) rather than this one which clamps the blade by screwing the blade down from the top. I only say that because I pretty much knew how to use it without any instructions. If you&#x27;re antsy about using it, watch any number of YouTube videos. You&#x27;ll see a lot of transcendent experiences--but also get a sense of how to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not necessary for you to use a badger brush and experience shaving cream. The complete package won&#x27;t give you that transcendent experience either. Try a brush and good cream if you want. Don&#x27;t think you haveto  buy the package.</li>
    <li> Finally, something that has actually lived up to its claim!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been shaving for about 25 years and have tried just about every Schick and Gillette razor that has come out. This is the only razor that has given me an extremely close and comfortable shave without having to go over the same area 3 - 4 times. I have a very heavy beard and shave both my face and my head every day, I also have very sensitive skin and occasionally get some ingrown hairs. I can honestly say that I have not had any ingrown hairs, and two passes (re-lather between) it is baby smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you who may be worried about cutting or nicking yourself...don&#x27;t. If you have been shaving for awhile and use some caution, you will have no problem. I have not cut or nick myself yet. I cannot recommend this razor enough!</li>
    <li> I purchased this simply because of a recommendation on an article on the Art of Manliness, I&#x27;m sure most of you reading this might have been linked here because of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I really love this razor. It&#x27;s perfect, I&#x27;ve tried a few others and I really love the long handle. I love how it&#x27;s grooved so it won&#x27;t slip out of your wet hands while shaving! I won&#x27;t buy a DE razor without a grippy handle now, especially helps if you have bigger hands. Oh speaking of handling...The head of the razor is good, it provides great control while shaving!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razors overall really skinny and slim design make it perfect to get those tricky areas like under the nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only gripe about this razor is that it&#x27;s weight feels really light, which I feel would be okay for most people. But I have very thick facial hair and a heavier razor makes it easier for the blade to cut easier with less strokes. But besides that I feel this is a terrific start-up razor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GET ONE!</li>
    <li> this is Great,,, all ready saving money and have a cleaner shave than a mach 3&lt;br /&gt;... but you do need to have the correct shaving cream and I watched a couple of&lt;br /&gt;you tube videos and made the difference of shaving.</li>
    <li> After years of being afraid of slicing my face like Edward Scissorhands, I finally took the plunge.  Say no more to electric razors, multi-blade razors that stink after a couple of weeks, or scissors.  If you want to shave like a pro and have zero ingrown hairs or irritation, get this razor NOW!  When it comes to performance, price, and overall health, this is the way to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Performance: from Mach 1 to Mach 5, this one crushes them all.  I&#x27;ve used high-performance electric razors and still take less time with the Merkur (including applying shaving cream).  This is easily the closest shave you can get without cutting your face up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price: think about it for a second.  You love your Mach X or whatever disposable razor you use the first time.  It cuts like butter.  But then you start to notice all those hairs and dirt stuck between those blades and you can&#x27;t do anything but replace the blades.  Blades cost like $10 for a 3 pack.  Well this is where it beats that.  You can get 100 blades for almost the same price which cut much sharper and you can clean like new after every shave.  What I do with this Merkur is have the water running a little and loosing the screws so the water can get around the blade.  Voila!  Long-term, you will wind up saving who knows how much with this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall Health: razor bumps no more.  In fact, razor bumps IMO may make your skin age quicker.  Add that to all the microscopic nicks you get from those multi-blade razors because you are trying to get closer and closer a shave and your skin just winds up looking bad.  With this, I cut in 1 swipe, rinse my face with warm water for a few seconds and it looks like I went back in time baby!</li>
    <li> Husband loves this and loves the fact that he is saving money every time he uses it.</li>
    <li> Disposable razors were eating my face. I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard and I get a lot of ingrown hairs. I bought a really cheap &amp;lt;$10 safety razor and nearly bled to death every time I shaved with it. It is now in a landfill somewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I checked reviews for the Merkur&#x27;s and seems like the majority loved them, but wished they had gotten the long handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing is cool. Shaving is like squeegeeing off the stubble. It&#x27;s not like shaving. Do some research about safety razor shaving and go for it.</li>
    <li> I love this razor. The long handle makes it easier for me to get a nice clean shave. It&#x27;s got a little weight to it, which I like. Of course the type of blades you buy for the razor makes a huge difference, but this sturdy razor does it&#x27;s part to provide me with a nice, smooth, comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> excellent quality  nice gift</li>
    <li> Glad to get the old razor back.  A much more cost effective way to shave.  This was at least 30% CHEAPER THAN THE RAZOR SHOP AT THE MALL</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that I am not big on writing reviews but I just had to leave some feed back about this razor. First of all the razor is very well made and functional. I have tried every razor out there including electric shavers and they don&#x27;t even come close to shave you get with this. I have very sensitive skin and have not had any issues after the first week of use. I cant speak to the life of the blade yet but so far so good after one week. I would highly recommend this razor for those looking for a close shave without the razor burn you get from the multi-blade shavers.</li>
    <li> I bought this item as a gift for my son-in-law for Christmas, and he reports that it is the most awesome shave he has ever had, so I am completely satisfied with this product!</li>
    <li> excellent razor, would strongly recommend!</li>
    <li> For the price, it is an extremely good build quality. It feels very solid. I enjoy shaving now that I have this beautiful razor.</li>
    <li> Good product except, for the price I paid, who only gets one razor blade with any other type razor you buy anywhere.</li>
    <li> Just buy it now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;ve switched, no razor bumps, two ingrown hairs (shaving against the grain on my neck) and baby-butt smooth cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The angle that this razor holds the blades at is absolutely perfect. The safety comb makes it almost impossible to cut yourself with a sharp razor. I&#x27;ve cut myself two times since I started using it, and that was with a multiple use blade after I started getting aggressive with it to see how much my face could take without issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only trade-off is time. Highly recommend using this with Shave Secret shaving oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus this thing feels like a piece of equipment. It&#x27;ll last longer than I will.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using my dad&#x27;s old safety razor for the past year as I&#x27;ve been exploring wet shaving, and I finally bit the bullet and got this beautiful safety razor.  I bought a stand that matches the chrome/steel, and I love the way it looks in my bathroom.</li>
    <li> Shaves closer and with less discomfort than the disposables.</li>
    <li> NICE EASY CLOSE SHAVE THE FIRST TRY!  NO LEARNING CURVE!  I received the razor today.  I didn&#x27;t shave for 5 days to see how it would work.  I switched from Mach 3.  Sometimes I used cheap plastic disposables that fill landfills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I shaved with this it was way easier than I thought that it would be.  Using it is very intuitive.  The Merkur took my stubble off much easier than my Mach 3 would have.  I now think that razor companies created products that were inferior to this simply to make money.  I don&#x27;t know why they ever invented anything else besides safety razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I will go from paying $3 per Mach 3 cartridge to paying $0.12 per blade for a much closer and less irritating shave.  And I feel less guilt because I am using less plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it right now if you are thinking about it.</li>
    <li> It didnt occur to me that my mach 3 has been giving me razor burn... i figured maybe i wasn&#x27;t using the right aftershave or maybe drying my skin out too much. I tried different shaving creams, lotions, etc... I realized that it wasn&#x27;t the lotions... it was the razor irritating me. I did a little research, and read that safety razor are coming back because multiple bladed razors are just too irritating on the skin. So, I decided to pick up this Merkur. I&#x27;ve shaved three times with i, every other day (before I would wait 3-4 days to let the razor burn subside), and it has been nice. Lots of people use shaving brushes and expensive soaps, and maybe I&#x27;ll go to that later just for the \\&quot;experience\\&quot;, but I&#x27;ve been using regular shaving cream after a hot shower with much success. No razor burn, and a very close shave. Looks like I&#x27;m a convert!</li>
    <li> OK, I never write reviews but feel compelled on this razor.  Believe all of the reviews, this gives the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had with a razor.  As a user of Mach 3 turbo for years and years, I originally purchased this because I was fed up with the high price of replacement blades.  After using this razor for a month, I would never switch back - even if it was more expensive.  After suffering from ingrown hairs for years (would average two to three a week), I&#x27;ve had exactly zero over the last month.  Yes there is a bit of technique to learn, but you can shave against the grain and get a far superior shave for substantially less money.  Oh, and I have yet to cut myself - so don&#x27;t be paranoid that you&#x27;re going to look like something from a vampire movie the first time you use it.  Get a quality soap and brush and make sure you keep the razor wet at all times and you&#x27;re off to the races.  I used to dread shaving and now I look forward to it.  Does it take more time?  Maybe a little, but it&#x27;s so enjoyable now I don&#x27;t mind one bit.  I also used the Wilkinson blades and they are super as well.</li>
    <li> This is my first safety razor and I totally recommend it, the finish looks great and it works really good, in my case my hands are not small so the longer handle is perfect and feels well balanced in my hands  judging by the quality of material i think i am going to have this razor for a lifetime, delivered on time and well packed so no complains at all</li>
    <li> Below is the listed product I am using as part of my \\&quot;Shaving Arsenal.\\&quot; It took me a while to find each piece needed to bring it all together. My approach was finding all the pieces that had the best reviews vs. price. Just about everything listed below was the \\&quot;highest price\\&quot; but luckily these items don&#x27;t cost much. Not CLOSE to as much as it costs to shave with Mach III Safety razors. If your ready to make the switch to a superior, and cheaper, alternative then check out the products below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Handle: Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor.&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed about this handle is the quality. You can tell its not your basic cheap piece of metal. Its got a comfortable weight to it, keeps its brilliant chrome finish, and clean up is quick and easy. I consider myself a man with normal size hands  and don&#x27;t know why this one is considered \\&quot;long handled.\\&quot; Its just a tad longer than the Mach III razor I used to use. However, it&#x27;s a night and day difference compared to those \\&quot;Safety razors.\\&quot; It cuts very close with minimal passes. I&#x27;ve never had a shave that was this close before.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Merkur-Model-180-Handled-Safety/dp/B000NL0T1G/ref&#x3D;sr_1_10?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1355613524&amp;sr&#x3D;8-10&amp;keywords&#x3D;double+edge+razor+handle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blades: 7a.m. Platinum Double Edge Safety Razor Blades&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve heard there are better blades on the Market but since I started out with a 100-pack it will be 2-YEARS until I need to buy any more since I change them out once a week. I&#x27;m half Filipino so I don&#x27;t have the thickest facial hair but definably pull off a goatee without a problem.  Other than one \\&quot;Dud\\&quot; all other blades have been very predictable and easy to use. I have gotten the occasional razor burn but that appears to be normal with any Double-edged razor. I was worried I would be opening myself up to more \\&quot;risk\\&quot; with these but feel that I am at no more risk than any other safety blade now that I am used to it.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017ZECA6/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_32&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stand: Safety Razor stand&lt;br /&gt; Once I learned that a stand was needed for the \\&quot;Tweezerman Men&#x27;s Shaving Brush\\&quot; I decided to go with this one. Its been 4 months and the chrome is still shining well. Its sturdy, and holds my double edged razor as well as the shaving brush as if this product was made just for them. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001XURHNY/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_42&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brush: Not sure why its made of \\&quot;Badger\\&quot; hair but its working. Where this brush looses a star is because it lost some of its bristles during the first week. Since then there haven&#x27;t been any more hair-loss and I&#x27;ve had no problems. 4 months going strong. It creates a nice lather and feels good against the skin. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G647Y8/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_47&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving Soap: Prosaro Shaving Soap&lt;br /&gt;It works but I with it had more lather. Based on previous reviews, it sounds like the amount of lather has significantly decreased. Does it work? Yes, but I like a good lather. Anyways, its been 3 months and I feel like I have maybe gone through half of this container which isn&#x27;t bad. It also has a very fresh but subtle smell which I really like.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00837YY18/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_44?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;redirect&#x3D;true&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soap Bowl: Guess I didn&#x27;t need this since I am using the Proraso Shaving Soap which is self contained. For as simple as it is, it lost two stars. There is a rim that goes along the bottom that has (or had) a black rubber piece that ran around it to provide a good footing for the Bowl while on a counter. The very first day this part fell off, it didn&#x27;t seat on there, and it wasn&#x27;t glued. In the garbage that piece went. The next star was lost due to finish. It was a pretty flat finish for chrome and you could see the several light scratches across it. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00404RI70/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_35&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After Shave:Virgin Island Bay Rum by Clubman&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tested several types of Aftershave in stores but never found anything I liked. Based on reviews I had a hunch I would really like this. Once it arrived I was right!

My wife is very sensitive to smells but this is one she actually admires.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000053L6W/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_2Virgin Island Bay Rum by Clubman&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tested several types of Aftershave in stores but never found anything I liked.

    <li> Nice shaver, great price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Friend bought the same razor at a shop for 3 times more.</li>
    <li> Will never buy regular razors again.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a cheaper and more effective shaving system. I tried Harry&#x27;s to no avail. I have been using Mach products my whole life and I have a very thick beard (Middle Eastern Descent) and honestly they only reason I&#x27;m looking at switching it&#x27;s just too expensive with the Mach 5&#x27;s. I get a great shave from them but it usually will only last 2-3 shaves if that and I have to change the blade. I was hoping I could find something that would give me just as clean as a shave and even if I had to change the blade after every 2 shaves it would be cheaper than using the Mach system. I read amazing reviews about this product and my colleagues even told me that long handled safety razors (not specifically Merkur) are the way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shave in the shower with a mirror and use a brush and cream to lather my face. With this blade which I attempted three times, every time it looked like I had massacred my face and could not stop the bleeding anywhere. I know you are supposed to slide down with it, I didn&#x27;t just point the blade perpendicular to my face but it did no good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it seems I have a very difficult set of stubble and would not recommend it for those with my experiences.</li>
    <li> Delivered as expected.  No problems.</li>
    <li> I had never really enjoyed shaving before using this razor. 4 and 5-bladed razors never gave me a consistently irritation-free and close shave, which wasn&#x27;t cutting it for me with how expensive replacement heads are. I&#x27;ve been using this single-bladed razor for a few weeks now and wow, no irritation at all and a close shave. It&#x27;s truly amazing. I will not be going back. It&#x27;s not difficult to use and it doesn&#x27;t take longer to shave once you get the hang of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that you don&#x27;t necessarily need to change your shaving cream (I use the irritation defense Gilette brand system), and you might have to experiment with the sharpness of the blades (different brands have different sharpness). Also, you shouldn&#x27;t need to make as many passes with this razor.</li>
    <li> I bought this item for my dad as a Christmas gift (he specifically requested it). He&#x27;s used another safety razor like this one for years, but it has a shorter handle. My dad is very happy with this razor. He said it has good weight and the long handle makes for easier shaving/handling if you have large hands. I also bought him a package of the Merkur-Razor Double Edge Razor Blades as offered through one of the sellers on Amazon since this razor comes with only one blade and I wasn&#x27;t sure how long they last.</li>
    <li> German stainless steel! This razor will likely outlive me.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Best shave I have ever had. .&lt;br /&gt;Took 2 days for my 5 o&#x27;clock shadow to come back.&lt;br /&gt;I watched the YouTube how to video and not a single cut</li>
    <li> I bought this razor because my husband has one and was raving about how good it is.  Once I ran out of blades for my other razor, I put in an order for this one and will never look back.  It is easy to shave your legs and underarms using it and I have no real fear of cutting myself.  The blades are much cheaper than replacement cartridges for other handles, and it is an attractive razor.  I get a nice, close shave with this razor and the blade does not dull quickly at all.  I have sensitive skin and it leaves me razor-burn free.  For anyone looking for a new shaving system this is it!</li>
    <li> Well, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m ever going back to my electric. This really does wonderful things for your skin. It&#x27;s a relatively mild razor, so you shouldn&#x27;t really worry about cutting yourself too badly. If you&#x27;re slicing off slivers of your face, it&#x27;s generally a result of blade incompatibility, and not the fault of the razor (not this one anyway). If you want to really get a feel for the right blade, get a variety pack with a few common blade brands in 5-blade packs. Don&#x27;t bother with the ones that give you 35 single blades. The vast majority will suck. This is the variety pack I got: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004UIZFQW/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll also need to worry about a lubricant. Most people will use shaving soap or cream, and these become more necessary with a heavier beard. I find that, for my lighter beard, two parts coconut oil and one part olive oil will give a cheap, skin-friendly paste that melts onto the skin, giving it plenty of protection from the blade. I generally wipe it from my face and razor with a dry towel, allowing most of it to stay where it is, keeping the blades from rusting. Also, since I&#x27;ve started doing this, my acne has all but disappeared. As this is all I&#x27;ve used, it&#x27;s all I can recommend.</li>
    <li> this is the best safety razor  bar noneyou can buy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll never shave with a stick razor again. I love it. Takes a little adjusting, but then you&#x27;ll never go back.</li>
    <li> I just switched to this safety razor about a week ago and don&#x27;t know how I have shaved with my old fusion or any cartridge based razor in the past. The difference really is pretty amazing and if I didn&#x27;t use it for myself it&#x27;s hard to believe just how superior a safety razor is... True, using a safety razor definitely takes a little while longer but the closer shave is astounding. I&#x27;m very happy with this razor and have been recommending it to all my friends. 5/5 stars</li>
    <li> Just bought this little gem, and I love it. I need to work on my handling, but the shave was close, and I love that.</li>
    <li> best razor that i have ever owned. I wished i had tried one of these along time ago instead of wasting money on all those triple blades etc.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this handle for over 2 years and haven&#x27;t been more satisfied with a razor. Between the quality and the money I&#x27;ve saved using a safety razor, this gets a 5 easily.</li>
    <li> This has a good and balanced weight to it. Holds the blade firm. It is as  I expected it to be. I am very satisifed.</li>
    <li> I submit the same problem I experienced with the &amp;#34;Barber Pole.&amp;#34;  Neither fit my stand and the description failed to fully describe the razor so I could make an informed decision.</li>
    <li> I previously had a cheap Chinese &amp;#34;butterfly&amp;#34; safety razor that jammed up and binded tight as it corroded from use.  Using pliers to try to force it open caused the $10 razor to break in my hands.  This Merkur replacement is a far better piece of steel.  The top unscrews instead of having an internal butterfly opening mechanism so I think it will last a lifetime.  Match it up with some Made in Israel 100 pack replacement blades and you have what can be a decade of shaving equipment for under $100.  Just add some good soap (buy Taylor of Old Bond Street here on Amazon), a good badger brush, and you have a great, close, relaxing shave.</li>
    <li> Like the light weight and the guards on either side against nicks and cuts. FYI. Not impressed withe Mercur blade that came with it. I&#x27;ll stick with my Wilkinson Sword blades thank you.</li>
    <li> New to single blade shaving, this is the 3rd one I have purchased so far and it is by far the best one I own.  Great weight and long handle is much easier for me to use.  Great razor</li>
    <li> I bought this for my thick-bearded boyfriend and he loves it.  He would always dread shaving because it hurt, but with this razor he says it doesn&#x27;t hurt and that it is actually fun to shave now.  Recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had mine since the beginning of the year and it is still in immaculate condition even after using it almost every day.</li>
    <li> After doing some careful research and putting myself outside my \\&quot;comfort zone\\&quot; of using cartridge-type razors my entire adult life, I decided to purchase Merkur Long with Guard razor in addition to the 30-count Feather Double Edge Blades.  I am pleased to share that after using my new razor for the first time today, not only have my expectations been exceeded, but all my fears and trepidation have dissipated as well.  Today, I experienced the closest shave of my life, and with no nicks, cuts, scrapes, or razor burn whatsoever.  Having such a great experience shaving with the included Merkur platinum-coated blades, I am really looking forward to trying the Feather blades later given all the positive feedback they&#x27;ve received online.  I highly recommend this razor to those looking to save hundreds of dollars on overly priced cartridge razors.</li>
    <li> This beginner&#x27;s razor provides all what I had expected of German engineering: precision and quality materials. After owning it for about a year, I have absolutely no regrets, and it continues to perform beautifully week after week. There&#x27;s no rust at all anywhere on the razor, and feels very secure and controllable in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The machined pattern on the handle is great for grip, and the hollow shaft is great for cleaning and drying inside and out.&lt;br /&gt;Since using this safety razor, I&#x27;ve felt much more in control of my shaving experience; would recommend over conventional shaving solutions.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor for my father in law, and he is very pleased, I deffinitely made him the happiest man o earth because he has been looking for one for years and finally he has it. He told me this one is better than the ones that he had owned before.</li>
    <li> first safety razor i ever purchased. very nice quality. easy to use, I have maybe cut myself four times since i have owned it. will purchase again if I ever have to.</li>
    <li> $30 is not a lot of dough when you consider that this handle will last forever. Love my Merkur... can&#x27;t say enough about it.</li>
    <li> Grew up seeing my dad use a similar Gillette razor back in 1990&#x27;s and ALWAYS wanted to own one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most imp wanted a 1 blade razor so I don&#x27;t have to shave EVERY 3 days and that is exactly what I got. My shave time now is 7 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality is good. Love the chrome finish. Meets the need and serves the purpose. Stored my stupid 5 blade razor away as I don&#x27;t see myself using it again UNLESS this thing just breaks randomly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 thing that would be NICE, is if it came with a case. I would pay extra for it. Just saying :)</li>
    <li> I have used multiple different razors of the years and wish I had switched over a safety razor much sooner, it is easy to use, provides an in credibly close shave and is incredibly cheap over the long run.  I would recommend this razor to any body.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what all the hype is about going back old school with shaving???  If these old style razors were all that, then why did our grandfathers and fathers go away from them? I admit, the idea of saving money was my main appeal, but I promptly lost that ridiculous notion after just one shave. NOW...if you have 15 to 20 minutes to shave every day, and love to pamper your face with lotions and badger brushes, and twist your face this way and that...then these are your razors; however, if you are like me, and would rather shave and be done with it, stick with the Gillette Mach 3, non-vibrating razor!!!!  I promptly sent this double safety razor back, because though some guys &amp; gals may love spending half the morning laboring over their shaving &amp;#34;experience&amp;#34;, I think most will not find such joy nor desire to give up such time. And unlike the idiotic infomercial out right now by that dork from Pawn Stars (I know millions love them but i personally do not), the razor companies may or may NOT be just in it for the money, but their product satisfies my need much better than does the double safety razor!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  It&#x27;s all about Mach 3 for me and I&#x27;ll build up my stock over the next several months.</li>
    <li> Safety Razors have a dubious (and misplaced) rap for being out of fashion; however, they are from from anachronistic. The multi-blade razors that have dominated the shaving market for the better part of 30 or 40 years is strictly from marketing (the message is they offer SPEED and a supposed cut-free shave; but we&#x27;ve all been cut using a Gilette or one of its comrades).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As someone who gets rather unsightly razor bumps, yet can&#x27;t obtain a smooth shave with an electric, I&#x27;m always on the look out for that Holy Grail - close shave, no razor bumps and a dependable/affordable instrument.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Merkur Safety Razor might be it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I&#x27;ve been using many products from Art of Shaving to prepare for the shave (and have achieved outstanding results wet shaving), I still get razor bumps if I use a disposable FOUR-BLADE razor after about 3 or 4 shaves. This gets irritating and pimp-slaps my wallet at least twice a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weight of the Merkur in my hand was sort of perfectly balanced for using this kind of shaving instrument for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pre-shave oil is must for wet shaving, but I didn&#x27;t realize how helpful it was going to be in enabling the blade to glide pretty much effortlessly, precisely slicing the hair without pulling on my hair (thus cutting it too short).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This type of shaving (wet with preshave oil and a badger brush to apply the lather) means that you&#x27;re not going to get out of the bathroom in less than five minutes, so give yourself enough time to do it right. You&#x27;ll immediately feel the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And after three shaves, no razor bumps! Which is critical, more important than a close shave.</li>
    <li> This is a great intro razor into the double-edged world. I bought this when I lost my parker DE razor, the parker never had a very good grip, and that always worried me. I&#x27;ve never had a problem since I started using this Merkur razor. I&#x27;ve actually never even cut myself once using this razor, and it&#x27;s been quite a while now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing is still working as well as the day I bought it, and I&#x27;ve been using it pretty consistently and have a very thick beard. It holds the razor blade very firmly, no wiggle room at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About DE razors though...when this says &amp;#34;long handled&amp;#34; it means in comparison with most DE razor handles, which are extremely short. &amp;#34;Long&amp;#34; is about 3 inches give or take. Also, while this has a better grip than most other razors I&#x27;ve seen, it still isn&#x27;t super grippy, which I thought it would be with the cross-etched pattern.</li>
    <li> As I have now left the military, I no longer shave every day. Shaving a 2/3 day beard with a double/triple bladed shaver is a torment, it gets plugged up and you have to try to clean it before you can keep on shaving. Saw an add for the simple safety razor I always used about 40 years ago. No more problems, even a two weeks growth disappeared in record time, love this thing.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this razor and the fact that the blades are so affordable really makes it pay for itself.</li>
    <li> It took a little getting used too, but after the first shave it was great.  The blade they provided was flimsy, easy to buy my own.</li>
    <li> I would like to say that I have never dry shaved but I always used the 3, 4, then 5 bladed Gillettes out there since I was in the army over my young adult life.  Dry shaving never really appealed to me but last Christmas my wife bought me a soap kit for wet shaving so I decided to take it to another level.  I got this beauty in today and had to give it a whirl despite me usually not shaving for two weeks at a time.  I usually went two weeks just because of how expensive the razors were to begin with.  After my hot shower I got out and scrubbed up for a shave.  After about ten minutes or so I was done shaving since I wanted to go real slow using a blade like this for the first time.  I got no nicks, scratches, burns, or anything of the sort and got probably what I would call the closest and cleanest shave I have ever had in my life.  The razor itself amazed me when I assembled it to the handle since it came in a thin piece of paper that could have been mistaken for a sticker.  If you are looking to start wet shaving or using a safety razor, this is the way to go!</li>
    <li> I have purchased two of these great razors. One for home and one for travel. I hope that generations to come will realize that double edge safety razors provide the best, closest, and most refreshing shaves which are substantially better than the expensive multiple blade razors that that have become so popular. If you haven&#x27;t tried a razor like this and like a great experience when shaving, you should definitely order a Merkur.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t crazy about the Merkur.  I had read so many great things about Merker but I found that the razor didn&#x27;t shave me as close as my Parker HD Long Handle.</li>
    <li> I am comfortable with this. No nicks or cuts. Good buy!</li>
    <li> While it&#x27;s not too hard, I would rather this razor use a twist open style of changing the blades.  It&#x27;s a bit cumbersome, although certainly not hard, to change blades on this handle.  Also, and I have no idea on earth why, but I can put a brand new blade in this razor handle and one side will shave better than the other.  I switched out to another brand new blade, same issue.  I cannot be certain, but perhaps it&#x27;s slightly off on one side? Would take a micrometer to know I suppose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the weight and it&#x27;s quality, but would rather have something different.  It&#x27;s how we learn I suppose.  It taught me one thing - this is the only way I&#x27;ll shave from here on out, or until they invite a lazer scaple like on Star Trek.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have much to compare this too, and it works exactly as I expected.  The only thing I was bummed about was in a youtube video I saw someone twisting the bottom of the handle to release the blade head, but on this one you have to twist the blade head.  Makes me a bit nervous, as I am certain I will cut my hand one of these days.  Don&#x27;t try opening this with oily, wet or soapy hands.</li>
    <li> I saved this for Christmas, and wasn&#x27;t sure if it was what my husband wanted. After the first try, he was in love, hasn&#x27;t gone back. never nicked his&lt;br /&gt;face.</li>
    <li> This is the second straight blade razor I&#x27;ve purchased because if you drop this one, it may chip the silver coat on the edge where it drags across your face [And that is not pleasurable]. Don&#x27;t drop this and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
    <li> This razor is fantastic! I bought it several years ago because I was tired of buying expensive disposable razors and wanted a more economical alternative. Most of the reviews I could find about safety razors were about men. Well, I&#x27;m here to say that this is a great razor for women, too! After a bit of an initial learning curve, I love this thing. I find it just as easy to use on my legs as a disposable razor, and I only have to replace the blade about once a month. The variety pack of double edge blades I bought 3 years ago (about $30) is not even half gone. Can&#x27;t beat that savings!</li>
    <li> This is just a basic razor but works well.  Has a nice solid feel and a good fit/finish.  Personally I think these are a little overpriced for what you get but it is something that should last your entire life if taken care of.  Does what it&#x27;s intended for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note on this model you unscrew the handle from the head and split the head apart to change blades.  It&#x27;s about as basic as it gets.  But that means it&#x27;s also pretty much foolproof.</li>
    <li> Best Shave I have ever had!</li>
    <li> Altitude pricey at first, but it saves a bunch in the long run.</li>
    <li> The best shave without a striaght razor.</li>
    <li> A nice simple safety razor with a bit of heft behind it. I like the long handle for better control.</li>
    <li> check out my pics. still getting used to it.  can&#x27;t beat the price of not having to buy $4 cartridges for a mach3 each week.</li>
    <li> this is not a long handle.  It&#x27;s shorter than my old regular Gillette sensor razors.  No idea why they call it long.  I chose it partly because of that.  It&#x27;s okay but I&#x27;m not impressed.  Some good points - it&#x27;s solid and well built.  the razor stays in place and the angle is good.  Very clean and nice looking.</li>
    <li> Great blade! It&#x27;s my first safety razor and I&#x27;ve really enjoyed using it so far!</li>
    <li> heavy duty and durable and gorgeous</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this razor to get myself and two friends started with wet shaving. The construction is excellent. It&#x27;s nice and heavy, giving you a great, smooth shave, and the long handle makes it very easy to control.</li>
    <li> Just got the Razor, and tried it out. Definitely worth it. I&#x27;ve been using the gillette fusion razor for a while now, buying $20 blades every 2 months or so, what a waste. I got a closer and smoother shave, spent only 6 bucks on 10 blades, and personally it took me the same amount of time to shave as any other razor.</li>
    <li> This thing is great. For years I&#x27;ve had a very rough time shaving. Any time I busted out the Mach razors my skin turned red and broke out in a rash. I tried electric razors and that either caused the same problems or didn&#x27;t cut at all. I can&#x27;t grow a beard because that tended to cause breakouts and itchy skin. I finally found out about these and they&#x27;re awesome. It didn&#x27;t take too long to find the right angle to use against my face. I&#x27;ve never cut my face with it, so I don&#x27;t know what the people in other posts were doing when they said they cut themselves. I&#x27;m the most accident prone person and so far no cuts/nicks. The replacements are quality and price is cheap. It&#x27;s easy to take a part and switch out too. The long handle is similar to normal OTC razors. This thing really has changed the way I shave. For routine I&#x27;ve been using the art of shaving sandalwood press have oil. I still use aveeno sensitive skin cream applied with a badger hair brush. After shaving I use Adidas aftershave. My rash/redness/irritation is 99.9 % gone. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Well, M.D.C pretty much says it all, with a nice video to boot.&lt;br /&gt;I used Gillette since they sent me a free razor for my 18th birthday, and I have been using the Mach3 for about 12 years.&lt;br /&gt;One week after using this razor I gave away my Mach3 razor and refills to my roommate.&lt;br /&gt;Enough said! I will not be going back to expensive refill razors!</li>
    <li> Smoothest shave I&#x27;ve ever had... I recommend it be used with proper before and after skin care products (such as pre and post-shave balm). So far so good!</li>
    <li> It is a good razor. I ended up purchasing a box of Astra blades along with it. It does not always shave as close on the first pass as I would like but overall I have no complaints at all and I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my hubby! He love it!&lt;br /&gt;Loves the close shave. Easy to handle and is easy to operate.</li>
    <li> As do I, great close shave!</li>
    <li> First I would like to point out that I&#x27;ve been in the military for many years. In other words shaving is a must, daily. I bought this razor about three years ago and never looked back since. Even after multiple deployments and field exercises its my go to razor. There is a small learning curve which can quickly be solve watching some YouTube videos on the subject. Rules of thumb; if it burns you&#x27;re pressing too hard, prepping is as important as shaving with good technique. Good luck!</li>
    <li> Merkur safety razors are a forgotten joy.  They are cheaper than one disposable razor or blade and do a better job.  Shaving was perfected 80 years ago and this is it.  No need for improvement.  Do they have six ridiculous blades now or was there an armistice?  Seriously, you need this razor and a set of blades for a total of $30 with a proper brush and shave cream to last the year instead of some ridiculous &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34;, 5-5 bladed razors for $18 every 4 weeks. $30&amp;#60; $200</li>
    <li> prefect, just what i needed.great shipping, product was as described.</li>
    <li> I like the angle of the blade on the MERKURs vs. the Parker. The Longer handle on this mode makes it easier for me to rinse off the Razor and to maneuver it around my face without getting my hand in the way. I am glad I got it!</li>
    <li> The safety razor seems to work well but am very careful so I don&#x27;t cut myself as it has been probably 45 years since I used a single blade.  Today razors have to many blades which don&#x27;t seem to go well with older skin.</li>
    <li> This item is wonderful, went beyond what i was expecting, I  read other reviews and had to try this out. I switched from a cartridge razor and this has been working nicely.  The construction is nice  and does not feel cheaply made.</li>
    <li> Have always been intrigued by this type of shaving.  Reminds me of my father and Grandfather.  I bought this razor after visiting a store that specializes in shaving.  I couldn&#x27;t believe the prices of their razors so I bought this one here along with a brush, stand, bowl and shave soap.  This razor is extremely sharp and offers a great close shave that when you are finished feels like a million bucks and is as close if not closer than my Hydro 5.  Plus, it makes shaving a pleasurable experience.  I highly recommend this razor and this shaving technique.</li>
    <li> Recently bought this because I have gotten tired of paying hundreds of dollars for blades each year.&lt;br /&gt;I shave my head and face (except for my goatee and mustache) and after some practice I can tell you I will never go back to twin or triple blades (thank goodness I never got to using 5 blade systems...how ridiculous)&lt;br /&gt;I opted for the longer handle as I am a big guy with big hands.&lt;br /&gt;I get several shaves from one blade, and don&#x27;t worry about putting a new one on considering I can get about 10 for 4$&lt;br /&gt;And remember you can use both sides of the blade...Make a few passes then turn to other side...few passes then rinse.&lt;br /&gt;Much easier to rinse than quad blades, believe me.&lt;br /&gt;So man up..like your father...grandfather...and so on, you can do it</li>
    <li> Simple design - nice &amp; shiny, holds a blade well &amp; feels great in my hands - I like the textured handle - keeps it firmly in place while shaving.  I have never tried a safety razor before - no worries, no nicks or cuts &amp; leaves a baby soft face.</li>
    <li> This is a real solid razor and has provided me with far better close shave than any of the disposable ones (gillette, etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love about this is the weight. It is perfectly weighted so it&#x27;ll work on my face while shaving but not too light or too heavy.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work well for me at all. I tried for about a week, but just got cut and many passes without being shaved. I returned and am forced to buy the expensive triple blades.</li>
    <li> Really nice high-quality razor with a good weight to it. Anyone that likes a real shave should enjoy this product.</li>
    <li> SO glad I bought this. I shave my head with it and it gets closer than disposable blades. I use it with a cup and brush with Van Der Hagen soap. It&#x27;s made shaving so much more enjoyable.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for me. Takes way more work than disposable razors. It&#x27;s not worth the money for me. Going back to disposables</li>
    <li> My only qualms with this particular handle and set-up is that it is perhaps slightly too safe.  I would prefer a bit more &amp;#34;tooth&amp;#34; in terms of blade exposure.</li>
    <li> I like this razor so much better tha my Parker butterfly razor.  The top on that one kept swiveling around and openind during use.  This stays nice and tight.  I would have liked a handle that was a little thicker and heavier but am very pleased with performance.</li>
    <li> This razor works great.  Very good build quality.  Holds blades nicely.  Does a great job - delivers as expected - no issues.</li>
    <li> I love this razor. It has taken me some time to get used to, but for the most part it does just as well as the Gillette or other mass marketed products out there. My face does not break out as much and I have way less in-grown hairs. I will keep using, and trying different blades with it.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty gentle razor, and it looks great and is a perfect match to the Col Conk stand that is marketed here. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that, with the longer handle, I found myself initially using that longer handle to apply some pressure to the face which is a pretty big no-no with DE shaving. With shorter handles I find myself letting the weight of the razor do the work. YMMV.</li>
    <li> Perfection in design. Excellent weight and balance. I can literally shave my face by using the weight of the razor only. Blade exposure can not be beaten.</li>
    <li> This was the first time I have ever shaved with anything but an electric or multi-blade razor. Usually I would have to shave with electric first and then the multi-blade to get a close shave and I usually had considerable amounts of skin irritation. When I received this razor, I decided to just give it a go with no pre-shave (haven&#x27;t shaved in about 4 days at this point). Let me tell you, this was the best shave of my life. I didn&#x27;t experience one bit or irritation, the razor glided on my skin smoothly like butter on bread. The shave was baby bottom smooth after 3 passes. To anyone on the fence about this, give it a try. This was one of the best decisions I have made it a while.</li>
    <li> I was apprehensive at first, that an old school razor would be the answer to my shaving woes. I have to tell you that at first the razor seemed quite hefty, but that all changes after I experienced one of the smoothest and closets shaves of my life. Even several hours later my skin was still smooth with no irritation. After years of double and triple bladed disposables, I have come to the conclusion we have been hood winked by the shaving industry. All you need is a good quality razor and blades, and walla, simplistic perfection. To sum up, I highly recommend the Merkur to anyone interested in making the switch or up grading from your current razor. They new what they were doing back in the day, sometimes you just gotta stay with the classics.</li>
    <li> great razor, use the astra platinum double edge blades with this, great together.</li>
    <li> So glad I finally tried the double edge razor. Like everyone else I am so tired of ridulous prices for overhyped razors with 3, 4 or 5 blades that don&#x27;t work any better than an old fashion double edge. I had no problems with razor burn or knicks and cuts, just respect the blade! Save your self the money and spare the environment the excessive plastic waste!</li>
    <li> This Merkur Razor came highly recommended from an article on Lifehacker and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  It&#x27;s easy to use, and makes you feel like a real man.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I used a razor like this when I was young but started using the double blade type of disposable razor and had forgotten how great a razor like this felt and shaved.  This razor has nice weight and is sharp looking plus it delivers a close and smooth shave.  I am glad that I am back to the basics, I get a great shave and I save money on blades too, who could ask for more!</li>
    <li> This razor is great! It feels great in the hand. It has a nice weight to it and it feels well designed and manufactured. This is my first DE razor, so my opinion may be limited, but I would buy this razor again and recommend it to friends.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with safety razors but I have used quite a few and this one is by far the most superior. I don&#x27;t know what it is about this but I get a much closer shave with a lot fewer cuts.</li>
    <li> No nicks, cuts, razor burn, quick shave time since there is no clogging between the blades like with disposable razors (even the expensive ones), using the blade that came with it no problem. I even use this razor to shave my head as well as my face.</li>
    <li> Good quality and deliver.&lt;br /&gt;I thank it will last for whole life for daily use.&lt;br /&gt;Can pass to you son as legacy.</li>
    <li> I feel like an old man using this thing.. in a GOOD way.  My face feels a lot better than using way more expensive razors that only last a couple weeks.  Sure, it normally takes an extra pass over my face to get a really smooth shave, but totally worth.  This with my badger tail brush and some nice shaving soap lets me enjoy my man-time to the fullest</li>
    <li> Have tried many different razors including some of the more fancier ones.  LOVE the basic Merkur - its a classic that will always be around.  Long handle is great for my XXXL sized hands.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  This product cannot shave as close, as smooth or be as sharp as my 5 blade shaver.  I have a very tough beard, it was painful and uncomfortable to use.</li>
    <li> I love this thing I LOVE THIS THING. Its sexy, its solid. Nothing feels flimsy and I can tell I will own this thing for the rest of my life. Don&#x27;t take the cheap route when it comes to your face, buy this Merkur and you will still be miles ahead of those people who are still shaving with conventional razors.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this to anyone starting out as a first time shaver for sure! Functions well and clean up is easy!</li>
    <li> Very nice for trying de shaving. Light, somewhat short, razor gives you the best shave you have ever had, hands down.</li>
    <li> Love this shaver.  Got started with double-edge shaving but with a cheaper Parker butterfly-style shaver - a struggle to use - too many moving parts that got stuck on themselves.  This Merkur is a dream by comparison.  The blade goes into the head eaily and the whole thing clamps together by threading and tightening the handle - like a well-engineered sandwich.  The whole thing feels tight with just the right &amp;#34;weight&amp;#34;.  I also like the &amp;#34;fluting&amp;#34; under the blade, I think it helps the soap/shavings clear the blade better.  I use this with Proraso Italian shaving soap and Personna platinum blades.  Shaving is great now!</li>
    <li> It is a very good and balanced razor. I would recommend it. It is a good buy combined with blades.</li>
    <li> Great weight for ease of use when shaving.  Excellent quality.  Would recommend for anyone wanting to try a safety razor.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement for a Mach III I&#x27;d used for the last decade. I&#x27;ve probably done thirty shaves with it. Here&#x27;s my take.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Is it a better shave?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In some ways. The Mach III is extremely fast, contours to your jaw line, makes it very hard to cut yourself, and doesn&#x27;t make total hash of a sideburn line. The Merkur does none of these things as well. It&#x27;s still quite fast. I learned how to use exaggerated hand movements and skin-shifting to do my jaw effectively. If I use enough soap, I rarely cut myself. Sideburns are still hit or miss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s some measure of satisfaction in the weight of the thing. I&#x27;ve also watched persistent razor burn from the Mach III disappear after a week, but that could also be attributed to the superior soap and rinsing with cold water instead of hot. Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with it, but if I had to go back to disposable blades, I wouldn&#x27;t feel overly traumatized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Is it a closer shave?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe. If you haven&#x27;t warmed your skin, worked the soap to proper lather, and used repeated short strokes, then no. Even if you&#x27;ve done all that, it doesn&#x27;t do well with contours. You&#x27;re likely to have rougher patches around your chin even with vigilance, though they won&#x27;t be visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then again, you might not want a close shave. It&#x27;s easy to get with any razor: just go against the grain. That&#x27;s likely to produce more ingrown hairs. I&#x27;ve also found that my stubble looks better on the second day than with the Mach III; that one did poorly on the mustache area, so the shading difference became obvious very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Long handle or short handle?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the long and I have large hands. It has slightly more stability and slightly less agility. The agility is important for angling the blade around your chin. You&#x27;ll be happy with either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Is it more economical?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone younger than 60 who shaves more than once a month, yes. Exactly how much more depends on how quickly you go through blades. Single blades last the same as the Mach III blades, so you can compare directly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Merkur outlay: razor ($35), soap ($10), and badger brush ($15)&lt;br /&gt;Mach III outlay: razor ($5), soap ($5)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mach III blades are about $2.50 each. Merkur blades are about $0.10. I go through a blade of either about every 10 days, so 35 blades a year. For me, here&#x27;s how it works out, assuming two soap containers per year:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YR1:&lt;br /&gt;M3: $102.50&lt;br /&gt;M: $65.00&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YR2-:&lt;br /&gt;M3: $97.50&lt;br /&gt;M: $23.50&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over ten years, it&#x27;s $275 vs. $975, or about $700 in savings. There&#x27;d be more if you used decent soap with the Mach III. The thing is though, in absolute value terms, shaving is cheap. The Gillette blades are annoying from the value perspective, but I don&#x27;t know anyone using them that&#x27;d go to the poorhouse over $70 a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* What should I know about shaving?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To recap from above: this razor is less forgiving than the Mach III. Prep matters more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Shower or heat your face with a hot, wet towel.&lt;br /&gt;2. Use conditioner in the shower or a pre-shave hair softener (optional)&lt;br /&gt;3. Make a frothy lather in your soap jar and apply with the badger brush. If you can see your face at all or the brush feels stiff, the water proportion isn&#x27;t right.&lt;br /&gt;3. Use short, quick strokes, flipping and rinsing the blade frequently.&lt;br /&gt;4. Pull your nose up to shave that area. Use exaggerated wrist movement to make the blade follow the contour of your jaw.&lt;br /&gt;5. Rinse with cold water and pat-dry.&lt;br /&gt;6. When you replace blades, grip the razor head from the short sides and keep it stationary. It&#x27;s very, very easy to cut yourself if you take the liberties the Mach III allows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t like the Merkur much initially because I wasn&#x27;t using enough soap and my strokes were too long.

    <li> This is my first safety razor, and I am very glad I went with a Merkur razor. The price is in the right range and it performs better than I expected. Would definitely recommend to someone interested in trying out safety razors for the first time.</li>
    <li> Handle broke off of the head within the first 9 months of owning it. I contacted Merkur over a month ago for a replacement. They assured me they were sending one but so far, nothing. You would think these would last forever.</li>
    <li> i MEAN COME ON...MADE BY GERMANS!!! GREAT MANUFACTURING. THE ONLY PROBLEM MY LOCAL CVS CAN NOT STOCK THE RIGHT BLADES...SO BACK TO AMAZON FOR THE FIX!</li>
    <li> Made in Germany the Mercur is the cream of the crop when it comes to buying the type of razors my dad used to use. I love it. Dont bother with the cheaper models its worth every penney! I ordered an extra case blades and wont be spending 29.99 every 4-6 weeks any longer at Costco on disposables.</li>
    <li> I love this Merkur! I&#x27;ve had a couple of different DE razors and this is the one I always end up shaving with in the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;good weight&lt;br /&gt;not too aggressive (because of the close comb design)&lt;br /&gt;had it for over two years now and I&#x27;ve had NO issues with it (chrome chipping or breakage)&lt;br /&gt;easy to change blades&lt;br /&gt;if it gets dirty, just wipe it off and it looks brand new&lt;br /&gt;CHEAP (by god razors can get expensive, this has an excellent price)&lt;br /&gt;the long handle is very ergonomic, and fits well in the hand (also extra weight from handle only adds to the closeness of the shave)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;None (I really haven&#x27;t had any issues with this razor at all)</li>
    <li> A great product all around - sturdy and well-designed.  Only complaint is that soap can get caught between the razor and the top and bottom, and the resulting build up can be difficult to clean.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this! It was a great Father&#x27;s Day gift! I would highly recommend this product to anyone interested! According to my husband it&#x27;s easy to use and easy to change blades!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband for a gift- he loves it- won&#x27;t use anything else. Amazing razor and also a fun classic look. Great shave every time.</li>
    <li> Have had this razor for a few weeks now and I really like it. Im use to a long handled razor.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut up your face like a demonicly-possessed machete like some cheap razors do. Weight feels just right. Grip is good if you get your hands wet; you don&#x27;t have to worry about dropping this and slicing your face open.</li>
    <li> First off, you should know that this is not a butterfly style razor. To replace the blade, you must remove both the guard and head from the handle as separate pieces. It is significantly slower and requires more patience than a butterfly razor that opens from the top when you twist the handle. I  assumed that a safety razor at this price point would have this feature. The weighting is well balanced and the included blade was adequate for my light stubble. For the money spent I think I could have done better, but I&#x27;m willing to stick with this for the moment.</li>
    <li> I remember watching my father use one of these. It took a short time to get used to it but it gives a great shave! I don&#x27;t have a really heavy beard, probably about average. It&#x27;s super easy to clean and no clogging up whatsoever. Just rinse under the faucet, shake the water off and put it away until the next shave. With this model you have to un-screw the head from the handle to change blades. It&#x27;s not that big of a deal though. The blades, compared to disposable 12 blade razor&#x27;s, ok 12 might be a bit of an exaggeration, are very reasonable. To me this razor is very reasonable.</li>
    <li> Nice razor, and it&#x27;s so much cheaper in the long run than the fancy razors that litter store shelves.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for! I haven&#x27;t been happy with price and/or quality of shave I get with disposable razors for quite some time. The craftsmanship and quality of construction of this razor is exceptional, and provides a superior shave for a fraction of the cost of disposables.  Great razor!!</li>
    <li> My new go-to razor, when I&#x27;m not using a vintage Gillette (:</li>
    <li> Maybe this product is good for men with light beards and tough skin, but I have a tougher beard and sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to get a close shave with this razor, I have to put too much pressure on my skin which leads to irritation.  I guess I&#x27;ll have to stick with my Gillette Custom Plus or Custom Plus 3 razor.  Don&#x27;t really like the cost, but gives me a close shave with no irritation.</li>
    <li> The quality of the razor is excellent, however, safety razor shaving is not for everyone and shaving this way may cause more irritation.  In terms of the shave, its just as close to a good quality disposable. But for sensitive skin, it may cause more irritation because this blade passes directly over the skin at an angle that is different from the disposable.  I am going back to good quality disposable razors.</li>
    <li> Best shave I&#x27;ve had since I had my old Gillette safety 25 years ago. I&#x27;ve had the double and triple throwaways in between. Nothing compares to this. Also, the brand of soap you use also makes a difference.</li>
    <li> Totally problem free. Great razor! I haven&#x27;t used the Merkur blade that came with the razor, but it is solid, well built, beautiful and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Best razor I have ever owned</li>
    <li> very nice will last you.</li>
    <li> The long handle is the way to go. I ordered feather razors to go with it as well. It is very easy to use and your face is way smoother than your typical store bought razor. I use original dove soap with a badger brush. Take your time when shaving with this razor and you shouldn&#x27;t have any issues with nicking your face.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality.  Solid construction.  I am actually enjoying shaving again.  Razor heavy enough to do the job by itself without added pressure.  Cleanup is a breeze.  Do yourself a favor and get this razor,  some quality blades and a shaving kit and reclaim your manhood...like a boss.</li>
    <li> Best shave I&#x27;ve ever had. Going on several months of use!</li>
    <li> This is how every man should shave. I love the weight of the razor, minimum effort to remove hair. Just make sure you rotate sides of the blade you use. I use each blade twice and use a new one because I cannot stand getting razor bumps. I&#x27;m sure if I had more expensive and durable blades that wouldn&#x27;t be a problem.</li>
    <li> Gives a good shave, the handle is hollow which gathers junk and lightens its weight/balance.  From a minor drop the screw came clean off at the location of its connection to the top piece.  Did not outlast the silvertip brush I bought with it...</li>
    <li> I like how easy it is to change the actual razor. I like the grip on the safety razor. I like the weight of it. This razor is excellent. Nothing too crazy, but certainly does not look or feel cheap. The perfect mid tier safety razor in my eyes. If you are having issues using this product, I recommend watching youtube videos on technique.</li>
    <li> Outstanding shave. I made my decision based on other reviews listed here and I was NOT disappointed at all! The simple design and ease of use makes this an ideal razor for anyone looking for a great shave!</li>
    <li> Absolute piece of crap. $34 for this! They should be ashamed!</li>
    <li> long handled?  not by long shot.  Shorter than the cheap disposables razors. DO NOT Buy if what you want is a long handled razor.</li>
    <li> Quickly became my favorite razor, love the weight and length of the handle, good strong, solid feel in your hand.</li>
    <li> This razor is sturdy and easy to clean, I highly recommend using Merkur blades they are a great combo.</li>
    <li> ...and purchased this razor. It&#x27;s got a natural feel while shaving and assembles/cleans really easily. No rust, pitting or flaws in the craftsmanship. I am 100% satisfied with this razor. I even got the wife using it for her legs!</li>
    <li> Gets a really clean shave and the overall weight feels nice. Much better than the cartridge razors I used before</li>
    <li> Well-made (of course,  it&#x27;s German).  Been using mine as my regular shaving method for months.  Finding the right blades for your beard is critical - I&#x27;ve been getting good results (smooth cut and many shaves per blade) with the Feather brand, but you may differ.  Being able to properly clean the blade gives massive improvement in cut and useful life over the clog-prone modern razors.  You can even re-sharpen if you have to -- put blade in a drinking glass, apply slight pressure,  slide blade along glass surface like a whetstone.  Not really a good use of your time, but something to remember for after the apocalypse of your choice.  Real shaving soap works better than the modern foamy canned stuff with this.</li>
    <li> This was my first razor in trying safety razor shaving.  I read that Merkur is THE brand to get.  The razor is everything I expected.  While I did mess up and order the wrong style (I was looking for the top that unscrews open), unscrewing the handle and switching blades is pretty easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great razor, until I get a ton more experience to be able to be swayed to another razor, I&#x27;d stick with Merkur, as it&#x27;s perfect for what I need.</li>
    <li> I love this razor &amp; could only give it 4 stars because I didn&#x27;t know that I had to unscrew the entire top to place the blade.  When I used to use my dad&#x27;s :)  I screwed the bottom &amp; the top opened &amp; I just dropped the new blade on the top.  This one is a bit more difficult although I love the weight &amp; heavy feel.</li>
    <li> I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has changed my razor-purchasing-anxiety life. Disposable razor cartridges are absurdly expensive. Safety razor blades are gloriously budget-friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took me about a week to get used to the different shave. You do have to hold the razor at a specific angle and glide over the skin very, very gently. After the learning curve, though, I can shave my legs just as quickly as before. AND they&#x27;re much smoother and less razor-burnt (I have incredibly sensitive and eczema-prone skin and dark, coarse hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life-changing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My ONLY negative thought: The handle can be a mite slippery in the shower. A better grippy surface would be helpful. 4.5 Stars, really!</li>
    <li> Ditch the plastic. Great shave.</li>
    <li> Also bought this for my husband&#x27;s birthday and he really likes the way it handles. This is his first double-edged razor and he&#x27;s pretty happy with it.</li>
    <li> ABOUT THE PRODUCT: when I opened the package, I was immediately impressed. Razor had a nice weight and was flawless in every respect. As an American who gets most if his goods from China, the Merkur was a welcome change, exemplifying German quality in every detail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ABOUT THE SHAVE: honest to god, the last time my face was this smooth was when I was 14. The merkur really does provide the best shave of your life. BUT BUYER BEWARE... Like anything in life, good things come to those who work for it. The same is true with this razor. If you think you&#x27;ll be able to shave like you do with your Mach III, you&#x27;re wrong. It&#x27;s not a fast shave by any means. To get a really smooth shave (at least for me), you need to shave three times. You heard me right, three. Every time you shave. Once with the grain, once sideways to the grain and once against the grain... Lathering up each and every time. If this scares you or you hate shaving, this razor is not for you. Buy an electric or keep dishing out cash on cartridges. If you enjoy your shaving routine (which I do) this will become a ritual you look forward to daily. There&#x27;s nothing like starting your day shaving with a heavy hunk of German steel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHY YOU SHOULD BUY THIS: take a step back and think of the possessions you own. What are your prized possessions? Your car? A TV or cell phone? I&#x27;d guess that most everything you own will end up in the trash a few years down the line. Do yourself and future generations a favor and buy something that will last. When your grandson is going through a box of your years after you&#x27;ve passed, he&#x27;ll come across this razor and know that it stood for something. This is more than a razor. This is about reclaiming our manliness and saying &amp;#34;I won&#x27;t be sucked in to clever razor marketing campaigns.&amp;#34; This is about taking pride in the things you own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Man up and buy this thing.</li>
    <li> Still holds up great after a lot of use and the savings over using disposables can&#x27;t be beat. Great shave.</li>
    <li> Everything about this razor is worth the money. I will probably have this for decades. Always properly clean and dry your razor after use!</li>
    <li> Sturdy product and it is easy to use. If you want a safety razor to start off then this is it for you.</li>
    <li> Listen - you don&#x27;t have to be a slave to Gillette&#x27;s products any longer.. This safety razor coupled with the right blades does an awesome job. My face is smooth, clean and clear of any redness, itchiness or any other uncomfortable stuff I would always get with other products. In the long run it&#x27;s cheaper, more environmentally friendly and just better all around.. So join the revolution!</li>
    <li> I like it.  This is my first Safety Razor.  Solid, feels nice, made in Germany.  Seems like something my son will probably inherit when I die.  Easy to open by spinning off the two piece head, then drop in a new blade.  Very simple, basic tool so there is not much else to say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say five stars, love it, as I haven&#x27;t tried any other safety razors to compare. But at this point I don&#x27;t feel the need to buy anything else.</li>
    <li> Got this for my hubby for Valentine&#x27;s Day along with some other shaving goodies and he loves it. He feels like a pro every time he shaves and loves trying out different kinds of razors and face balms or whatever and is having a blast. So glad I got it for him, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> I shave my face and entire head every other day.  It took a couple times to get used to it (few scrapes and cuts in the beginning) but now I can shave almost as fast as I used to with the old throwaways for a much better shave.</li>
    <li> Gives safe close shave(I prefer use it with Astra blades). Nice looking razor. Easy to clean a blade with the running water while shaving.</li>
    <li> Got this instead of the short handle due to the reviews on it, and glad I did.  Great weight, super easy to use.  New to DE shaving but love it so far.</li>
    <li> I got this for my dad for father&#x27;s day now i want one. It Look like a great razor. Plus it would be better then wasting money on disposable razors.</li>
    <li> Build quality is top notch. .  Razor works and looks almost as good as my d2... For the price i am extremely happy to have an excellent travel razor.</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my husband and he loves it!</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Saving a ton of money and avoiding ingrown hair bumps by not buying ridiculously overpriced multiple blade razors.</li>
    <li> enjoying it, also purchased another as holiday gift for my dad</li>
    <li> I am getting better shaves.  Of course, it is the combination of shaver, razor, and shaving cream.  But I am pleased with this razor.</li>
    <li> Works great, cheaper to shave vs the throw away brands</li>
    <li> Love this razor!! Beautiful! Great feel!! Well built!</li>
    <li> Happy with it.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Gave as a gift but a very forgiving razor to start safety razor shaving with</li>
    <li> The razor does not shave the hair just below your nose. Keep your disposable handy for those hard to reach areas.</li>
    <li> Quality, German engineering, simplicity in design. Real deal old school shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weight, size &amp; form are true to the style. Elegant design. It&#x27;s not adjustable but with proper technique you can get it done right.</li>
    <li> I have had this razor for 6 months now. I have tried it 3 times and all 3 times I had the worst shave and nasty cuts. I was very careful but still. I will stick with the modern razors.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor along with a shave kit( bowl, soap, and badger brush ), and 100 blades back in September of 2013 for a total of about $50.  My unique employer mandates me to shave every single day.  Before switching, i was at Sam&#x27;s club buying hydro5 bundle packs for 46.00 every month or two. My facial hair grows unexplainably quick and i was forced to shave twice a day due to a 12:00 shadow.  Since the initial purchase i am now just to the point of buying new blades and am waiting for them from a recent amazon purchase. Point being, i went from a more inexpensive cartridge style razor to this great handle and have saved almost $700, no longer get 12:00 shadow (now its about 3:00 shadow) and thoroughly enjoy my shaving experience.  My hair growth is bizarre but if it handles my aggressive curse i have no doubt itll satisfy all your hopes and dreams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Numbers. (My personal experience)&lt;br /&gt;Double edge safety razor&lt;br /&gt;lifelong Handle 30.00(with proper care)&lt;br /&gt;Astra blades 11.00 ($0.11 per blade. Front and back&#x3D;4 edges, $0.03 cents an edge. Blade is good for about 4-16 days)&lt;br /&gt;Shave soap kit 10.00.( replacement shave soap $2.50 at Wal-Mart, lasts anywhere from 30-45 days).&lt;br /&gt;Yearly Total 72.54&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hydro5.&lt;br /&gt;Handle $7.00(free with cartridge purchase of 8 or more)&lt;br /&gt;4 cartridges $14.00 (3.50 a cartridge, lasts about 3(6 shaves for me) days without razor burn.)&lt;br /&gt;Sensitive skin shave gel $3.75-$4.25(good for about 30-45 days&lt;br /&gt;Yearly total $527&lt;br /&gt;The above is my experience tailored to my situation and circumstances. But if you shave less then i do than your 72.54 will last a lot longer than mine</li>
    <li> This product will likely outlive me...it is very durable, high-quality, and has a simple design that avoids opportunities for breaking parts that need to be replaced. However, it does not have the safety features that come with the more disposable designs. You really need to be careful when you&#x27;re shaving or you will get nicked.</li>
    <li> GREAT! it took forever to figure out that the entire handle scores off, not the head from the handle. it is 3 pieces. but very durable, very safe. MANLY SHAVE TIME.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 38, and I have used disposables or replacement head types since my teens. Why this these go away, and surge back into style? Because they work so well. I love this thing, and its the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had. I can also now go about an extra day longer without a shave, and the blades are dirt cheap and last a long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve now purchased 6 of these Merkur razor, used by both the males &amp; females and won&#x27;t ever go back to &amp;#34;modern&amp;#34; razors again. These give the closest shave, we use the Feather blades, shaving cream/ brush method and legs or face this razor replaces all the rest. My military users love it because they don&#x27;t have to shave twice a day! Ditch the expensive replacement blade razors and get a better shave with the Merkur.</li>
    <li> Love it. Feels great, easy, and cheap blade replacement</li>
    <li> So far I have really enjoyed shaving with this razor. My only complaint is that the razor handle , even though is the long handled razor, feels to short and sometimes cramps my hand. But other then that a 100 percent change from that of a every day Gillette , or electric razor.</li>
    <li> Okay, I bought into the whole &amp;#34;timeless manliness&amp;#34; thing, I admit it. Fed up with the outrageous $16 for 4 blades at target, I so wanted to like this product (goodbye to American multinationals like Gillete, I had found a new pride in my adopted shaving land of German nationalism) and give it the overwhelming thumbs up it&#x27;s gotten...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;how it was so highly rated is beyond me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First the good, solid construction. Simple design. Feels great in your hands. Doesn&#x27;t cut like others had noted. Looks cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The not so good... I spent at least twice the amount of time, and got half as good a shave as my Gillette fusion gave. I&#x27;ve used it twice now and my wife can&#x27;t get over how wonderfully rugged my beard growth looks after shaving. Think Don Johnson and Miami Vice but not as even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line. Buy this because it looks cool. Get the accessories including badger brush, etc. Guests using your bathroom will be suitably impressed with this bathroom decor and it&#x27;s a great conversation piece. For the single man, it&#x27;s a no brainer. Your overnight guest will be suitably impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be sure you&#x27;ve got a modern day razor hidden somewhere.</li>
    <li> My husband has been looking for a perfect razor, and after reading a lot of reviews he found this one. I got this for him along with a shaving kit that has a different razor, and until now he is still blurting out how nice it feels using his new razors.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Merkur safety razor along with a package of Feather Razor Blades and some Kiss My Face Moisture shave as a gift for my partner.  He absolutely loves the close shave he now gets - he was never pleased with the razors he had in the past.  None of them truly shaved close enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His reasons for choosing to use a Merkur over average commercial razors:&lt;br /&gt;1. Plastic razors wind up in landfills&lt;br /&gt;2. Razors require propriatary blades that are expensive and short-lived&lt;br /&gt;3. Most shaver/razor brands are manufactuerd by corporations who also do hideously cruel animal testing.(i.e. Proctor and Gamble own Gillette, and test multiple cosmetic and personal products on animals, even though this kind of testing is outmoded and unnecessary).&lt;br /&gt;4. Commercial razors just don&#x27;t give the best, close shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took just a few shaves for him to completely master the use of his new razor, and he loves it!  And I can attest that his face is smoother than it ever was before.  Merkur has gained another lifelong customer.  My partner says he&#x27;ll never go back to commercial razors.</li>
    <li> Those Germans can make some great razors! If you want a great shave you gotta do it old school. It is well worth the money!</li>
    <li> For a starter razor, and a razor that I plan on using for quite a while, there is no other razor that I would suggest to any of my friends. My review is clearly not that long, but seriously, anyone who is interested in making the switch from cartridge shaving to proper double edge shaving, this is a blade I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I am 46 years old and, until today, have never shaved with anything other than disposable or cartridge razor.  It was the best shave of my life.  No irritation at all.  I had not shaven in a few days and with just the pressure from the weight of the razor, it sliced through the whiskers like they were nothing.  Why did most of humanity switch from this type of shaving to disposables?  And it&#x27;s cheaper.  There is no going back.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a cheaper, butterfly-style safety razor for a few years.  It finally broke, so I bought this.  I get a much better shave with this.  The butterfly style razors can bend the blade at weird angles.  This razor keeps the blade angle consistent, giving a closer shave and avoiding cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re new to safety razors, you may cut yourself at first.  That&#x27;s normal.  Once you adjust to the different technique, you&#x27;ll have less skin irritation.</li>
    <li> After showing a friend my 1904 replica Merkur Razor, he instantly wanted one for himself but with a longer handle. This was the solution. It was purchased as a gift and made a razor enthusiast happy.&lt;br /&gt;When compared to any disposable razor blades, this is far superior!&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+heavy handle means less work for shaving&lt;br /&gt;+longer handle&lt;br /&gt;+same merkur top half&lt;br /&gt;+ no rusting&lt;br /&gt;+ no more razor bumps&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;+none</li>
    <li> I was in doubt if I should buy or not this type of Handled Safety Razor. I&#x27;ve been using expensive Mach3 products for such a long time and everytime I tried another brand it never came close to the expensive Gillette brands. And plus, my  skin is very very sensitive to the blades. So I thought how could a single blade be any good to my skin. I decided to try anyway and I am glad I did. This blade is very easy to use and does the job much better then all the razors I had before. Such a good quality handle and the blade does shave better! A much closer shave. In the first 2 tries it left a very small cut, after a applied the aftershave it disappeared. As of now after 2 weeks of using it, it is very smooth. I am glad I found this cause it will save me so much money and happy with a good shave!</li>
    <li> Excellent construction with good weight. I&#x27;ve used it several times with Shark razor blades. Gives a great close shave.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure it is assembled correctly before using! (It&#x27;s easy to put the safety bar piece on upside down)</li>
    <li> I have been using it for six months now and have gotten the closest shave i have ever gotten in my life. it takes a while to learn how to shave with it but after you do it i guarantee that you will have the same results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i was previously using the schik quatro but when i shaved against the grain i got horrible razor burn, but with the merkur you can shave against the grain giving a closer shave without the irritation</li>
    <li> dont need no 3 or 4 blades. old school.</li>
    <li> I cannot even begin to describe how amazing this razor is. I have super sensitive skin and always used to get really bad razor burn on my neck with conventional razors. This single blade razor is nice and heavy and goes across my face like a feather on a babies butt. Even my wife noticed how much of a closet and smoother shave this provided. My razor burn is gone. I love this razor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with 1 razor to get you started&lt;br /&gt;Its super easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;Extremely easy to use</li>
    <li> The razor is easy to hold, looks nice and works well. The long handle is not slick and easy to put the blades in and take them out.&lt;br /&gt;Love ti</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying that the merchant was very fast shipping this razor and I was happy with the service.&lt;br /&gt;I like the look and feel of the razor and it seems well made but the shave I received was very bad compared to my triple blade razor. It did not get the contours of my face and it did cause a lot of irritation to my face. I tried the razor for 8 days thinking I had to condition my skin to it but it just never did get any better. I also tried other blades with it and the result was the same. The shave I received from this razor compared to what I was using isn&#x27;t even close. I&#x27;ve been shaving for over 40 years and this razor is the worst I&#x27;ve ever used. Went back to my old razor and won&#x27;t be changing again.</li>
    <li> unlike the 1903 this shaver has a slightly larger gap between the blade and the metal comb. Great for shaving through a thicker beard.</li>
    <li> Well built and solid. Quality chrome plating.</li>
    <li> Listen...Stop reading reviews and buy it! My buddy told me about this razor a year ago and I finally made the plunge. I got it shaved with it once and slapped the crap out of myself for not buying it sooner! Throw your cartridge razor out and be a man...you owe it to yourself...</li>
    <li> After using this razor for a week, I must say I&#x27;m baffled to explain how multi-blade cartridge razors ever caught on. I can&#x27;t think of any advantages whatsoever to using them, because this razor is just as easy to use, takes the same amount of time, cuts closer, and irritates my skin less. It&#x27;s also easier to clean, and while it does cost more than the &amp;#34;handle&amp;#34; of a cartridge model, the blades are a fraction of the cost of cartridges. I imagine I&#x27;ll break even in a few months&#x27; time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, it works fine with regular canned shave cream, too, if you&#x27;re not into the whole cup-and-brush routine.</li>
    <li> Purchased this product a couple months ago. Ive shaved with it several times. It takes a little getting used to but after a few uses Ive found not only is it cheaper to shave with this, but it is a excellent product and will hold up to several years of use. I may upgrade razors someday, but for now I am content with this one I have now.</li>
    <li> What do you mean you can get a quality, closer shave with 1 blade than you can with 3... 4... 5... blades?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a change for me to slow down and be careful with shaving, but the results speak for themselves. I feel I&#x27;m able to get a smooth shave even in the cleft of my chin and along the jaw line with this razor. It takes almost no time replacing the steel blade on this razor, and very little maintenance to ensure it&#x27;s long life, but it&#x27;s worth it. Time to get rid of my Mach 3.</li>
    <li> I was paying outrageous amounts of money for disposable razors.  This is about ten bucks for a hundred blades.  I get a smooth shave, better than I ever got with the Mach3.  I don&#x27;t cut myself.  Only happened once when the handle and head were loose.  Make sure they&#x27;re screwed on tight before you start shaving and you should be fine.  I know different skin, different results, so you&#x27;re going to see differentiating reviews, but I love this razor.  Feel like a moron for spending all the money on the other ones for so long.</li>
    <li> this product takes me back to the days when shaving was a blood sport in the morning. Shaving may not have been the best part of one&#x27;s day, but if he could get through the shave with a minimum of 4 tissue patches on your face the rest of the day was a piece of cake. Love the product. I glad you still make it.</li>
    <li> Great razor , my first DE Razor so I a getting use to it.</li>
    <li> Razor gave an ultra-smooth shave</li>
    <li> Great Safety Razor HANDLE... but lets face it, if you don&#x27;t buy the correct BLADE you won&#x27;t get the shave you want!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve but using the Feather Hi-stainless Double Edge blades in my Merkur Safety Razor for over a year and never had an issue.... I&#x27;ve got to believe anyone rating this razor low for reasons other than the handle breaking (which I still believe is due to mistreatment) is due to picking the wrong blades... Guess I&#x27;ll update if I ever have an issue... but so far, so good!</li>
    <li> Great razor, for the money it is well balanced and easy to take apart to clean. Would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> So true.  This razor is fantastic and saves so much on the cost of blades.  Go back to when men used single razors and you will not be disappointed.  Great find and highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Never thought I would be inspired to write a review about a razor.  The way I see it is that if you are going to spend a lifetime of doing something that isnt all that pleasant (shaving), you might as well make it as comfortable and pleasant as possible.  This Merkur long handled safety razor has done that for me. I get a great shave and can compare it to a Parker long handled heavyweight I was using.  The Parker butterfly mechanism broke after about 4 months of use, so I got this Merkur.  The Merkur doesnt have a butterfly mechanism.  You need to unscrew the handle from the head to clean and replace the blade.  I m fine doing this as I dont think the Merkur would ever malfunction, and you only need to clean it when you change the blades..just rinse it off and you are good to go for your next shave.  The shave I get is as close or maybe even slightly closer than I got using the Parker and I dont have to be as careful regarding getting nicked.  I used the Feather brand blades on both razors. The weight and balance of the Merkur is superb. The parker felt weird as it was very heavy in comparison but most of the weight was low in the handle making for an awkward feel for me.  I cant see this razor ever breaking or wearing out.  It&#x27;s great! Might as well enjoy your shaving ride as much as possible.......</li>
    <li> The hardest part is finding the right razor blades for your face, but like it said, this product does its job.</li>
    <li> The price of good disposable razors have gotten stupid ridiculous.  The Merkur Safety Razor is a quality instrument with a nice heft that glides smooth w/o causing nicks.  I can&#x27;t see going back to disposables.  Great Razor!</li>
    <li> This is not your dad&#x27;s razor, it is your great grandfathers. Go back in time and enjoy a high quality, close shave as it should be with a double edge safety razor. This Merkur has a comfortable length handle for typical medium sized hands. It is heavy and good quality and has worked perfectly with the half dozen or so brands I have tested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a razor for a rushed shave and does not feel the same as a typical 3-5 blade cartridge. Expect a few cuts when getting started, but a more controlled and closer shave than you ever get from the most popular modern shavers.</li>
    <li> I grew up without a dad so needless to say no one taught me how to shave, since ordering this razor i know ill never go back to disposables this thing is flat out awesome and fancy looking</li>
    <li> If you are NOT careful, especially around the chin, or if you have razor bumps, you will certainly bleed from this sharp razor.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a smooth cutting razor, but it&#x27;s ok. the fusion, although expensive blades, still does an exceptional job.</li>
    <li> Loving this razor. Theirs literally no build up at all in the razor at anytime I&#x27;ve rinsed it.&lt;br /&gt;The shave is great too. No complaints.</li>
    <li> Arrived as described. Excellent seller</li>
    <li> OK, so I was lured in by all the reviews and had stumbled upon some stuff about safety razors when looking up ways to reduce razor rash which I would get often, despite different shaving creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used a Gilette Mach 3 since I&#x27;ve been shaving (13-14 years)? I had tried the 4 and 5 blades but no luck, they always made razor rash on my neck far worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This safety razor is awesome. I was nervous about all the different &amp;#34;techniques&amp;#34;, but in the end I pretty much shave exactly the same way I did w/ a Mach 3 with just a few subtle differences. I do go over everything twice, you will inevitably miss stuff the first time around, and unlike the Mach 3 you cannot go back without reapplying shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the long handle and safety cover, it seems it would be incredibly difficult to cut yourself. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and it&#x27;s perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting the blades in and out is a little tricky, as there is nothing to grab onto except the side edges, but the shave is well-worth the aggravation. NO MORE RAZOR RASH, a MUCH closer shave, and a much better feel - and MUCH cheaper than the disposable blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do highly suggest getting the razor blade sampler pack. The different brands blades all feel far different. I suspect some people who used it and hated it, might of just had an experience with a bad blade. Some are way better than others.</li>
    <li> I ordered this razor after reading the unhealthy reports about disposable razors and how stuff collects between all those extra blades, also my son has been using this same razor for several years. The first shave felt as if I did not have a blade in the razor at all, very smooth, like any other razor, you have to get used to it. I do like the long handle, not sure who or why you would want a short handle on this razor.</li>
    <li> The razor is great, as to be expected from Merkur. I prefer the longer handle although it did force me to buy a different stand for the razor, in order to accommodate it.</li>
    <li> Last summer I revolted against paying the ridiculous prices of multi-blade cartridges and foolishly tried disposable razors to save a buck.  Ouch!  I started investigating shaving and learned of the double edged phenomenon and people going old school.  After hemming and hawing over the initial investment cost of this Merkur I decided it was really only the same as two refill cartridge packs and why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a happy convert!  Blades only cost pennies now, yippee!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had to slow down my shaving and I am using a brush (borrowed from my husband) and shave soap now, but I am very happy with the results.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in the frequency I need to shave, I&#x27;m still doing it every other day, and there&#x27;s a real learning curve to underarms with a DE blade, but I&#x27;ve found the Merkur long handled razor very comfortable in my hands and it works well on my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband uses it now, too (with separate blades, of course).</li>
    <li> For years I have shaved with an electric razor. I&#x27;ve never really enjoyed shaving though. In fact, if I went more than one day without shaving then my electric would hurt more. I had the occasional ingrown as well. I tossed around buying a straight razor, but had visions of slicing my carotid and blood spurting from my neck. This review will also be a short summary of my entry into wet shaving, along with a review of this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I actually look forward to shaving! I bought the Merkur long handle since I though the longer handle might provide some more stability while I learn. I was right about this. It has good weight, proper balance, and just has the perfect heft in my hand. The angle of the blade seems right as well. When I put a blade in and tighten it down, I can tell that the blade flexes a bit and it appears to be perfectly centered and aligned evenly. No funny angles on the blade. Craftsmanship is solid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did take a while to figure out how to shave without nicking myself. The three most important factors were: 1.The pressure I put on it, 2.The direction of the shave and, 3.The texture of my shaving foam. I have some hairs on my neck that grow totally sideways and fairly flat to the skin. With this razor, I first pass with the grain, and for those hairs my final pass is perpendicular. I just can&#x27;t go against the grain without nicking myself. Even if I use no pressure at all, just the pressure of the razor, I still get nicks on that section. I blame my face, not the razor. I go against the grain on the rest of my face with no problems. This razor is aggressive enough that you could mess up your face pretty well if you try to push too hard. But is also forgiving enough that if you don&#x27;t put pressure, you get a very close shave without the nicks. My face was NEVER this smooth with my electric. If you don&#x27;t have to wear a suit to work, you could get away with shaving every other day. It takes me between 10 - 15 minutes to shave now, but I look forward to it with anticipation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was tempted to spend the extra for the full stainless steel, but I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t for my first razor. I wipe off the soap residue after each shave and the chrome has retained it&#x27;s full luster. I shave daily with it, but not in the shower. I rinse it with hot water before I hang it since I figure it will dry out faster this way. I have had it for several months now and it still looks brand new. I am now buying this for my brothers for their birthdays! If you are considering dropping the electric, or disposables, or Dollar Shave Club, do it. You won&#x27;t look back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the Astra Platinum blades, and like them...but that is a different review. I have tried three different creams/soap and so far I like the Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood the best, but that is also a different review. I also bought both a badger hair brush and a boar hair brush. Each has it&#x27;s advantages and I use them both. I am otherwise busy enough that I am happy to make the extra time to shave this way. The variety available with a wet shave will turn an otherwise boring start to your work day into a peaceful, almost spa like experience.t with anticipation.

    <li> Good shave, works very well will save me some money since the razos are not $4 each. Get Pumped For It</li>
    <li> By far one of the best razor&#x27;s i have owned. For the longest time ive been spending so much money for other brands that would be done in about half the time that this one has lasted me. The shave is exceptional , one of the smoothest and comfortable.</li>
    <li> After years of using the most new, and trending four, five blade store razors. I thought I would try a single safety razor, and feather blades. After one use I will never use anything eles. Yes it takes a little longer to shave, but the results are so worth it. Clean close and the best shave you can obtain. If you are concidering even trying a saftey razor, do it. You wont regret it. And the money you save on the comercial brand garbage, you will wonder why you ever bought them in the first place.</li>
    <li> Love it use it every day.</li>
    <li> I was happy with the performance of it but after less than a year it broke. There are two pieces that screw together and after a while thje threads would not catch so the unit could not be used.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m looking for a better built one now but thought I throw this review out as a warning to others.</li>
    <li> I like the Safety Razor by this seller because the razor is long and allows me to shave at many different angles. Also, the product shipped fast to my home. However, I like the wilkerson blades ( 2$ for 10blades) from wal mart a little better than the blades that came with the Long handled safety razor because they are sharper. Futhermore, the seller may have some sharper blades to go along with the Long Handled safety Razor. Futhermore, what i like best about these safety razors and blades is that you do not have to worry about razor bumps!</li>
    <li> With this razor you have to go slow but the result is a close and comfortable shave. It&#x27;s made of high quality material and is worth the price for anyone tired of cheap plastic razors.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I finally got to give Gillete the finger! They needed it over the price of their razors. This was my first safety razor and I&#x27;ve got nothing but good things to say about it. It&#x27;s still in the same shape it was in when I bought it and it&#x27;s just as easy to use as any other razor. You just use lather instead of shaving cream and you shave exactly the same way as you do with a standard razor. The shave time is exactly the same for me as it was when I used a Mach 3. But here&#x27;s something to consider.. Gillete based all their Mach 3 commercials on the idea of, \\&quot;fewer strokes, less irritation,\\&quot; but with a safety razor you use the same amount of strokes (1 stroke) with a single blade. So, by their own logic, this is a better razor. And I&#x27;ve honestly only cut myself one time in the last 8 months of using it. The only difference is that I&#x27;ve spent less money to do that than I did with a Mach 3.</li>
    <li> with this amazing long handle safety razor .. i am able to enjoy shaving every day.. my face has a clean feel and my lady loves it.. right after a nice hot shower ..a feel good shave goes a long way.. hope you will pick one up.you will have made the best investment of your life.. easy on the face .easy on the budget too.</li>
    <li> I will never use cheap disposable head razors again. Razor has consistent space smooth and a nice weight to it actually more comfortable with the more stuble you have easy to clean easy to change the blades going to buy Another for a travel set may go with a shorter handled one</li>
    <li> Just got this the other day and love it! The weight feels great. Build is really nice. I think this could last me a lifetime. The only downside is there was no maintenance instructions just in case I didn&#x27;t know how to maintain metals.</li>
    <li> Do yourself a favor ditch the mach 20 turbo doucher razor and buy this you will not regret it, yes the start up cost is more but in the long run you will save money and the shave is remarkably better than any multibladed razor can give you.</li>
    <li> Finally shaving like a man.  Been using Gillette for a while but this has improve my skin and hair maintenance.  I am African-American and our hair makes things complicated.  I love the smoothness this provides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to get the blades Amazon recommends or better.  This setup works amazingly.</li>
    <li> I am so surprised to be saying this, but the double-edged razors are so different than your typical store-bought cartridges. Changing a blade is simple, the quality seems nice and durable, and the price was right. I had to relearn a bit of shaving technique with a DE razor, but the results are worth the few nicks I received my first few shaves. Great purchase.</li>
    <li> Good product for the price.</li>
    <li> This is my first safety razor, and I wish I had switched long ago.  I&#x27;ve had very few nicks shaving with this, and mostly having issues around my jaw line.  I know this is due to shaving with cartridges that didn&#x27;t require any care or thought while shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am getting a much closer shave, with much less irritation.  I tried to go back to a cartridge while traveling and hated the feeling.  I plan to use this Merkur for a long time.  Construction is great, feels good in my hand, and looks nice sitting out.  I&#x27;m a big fan</li>
    <li> I have been looking into safety razors for a while.  Having finally taken the plunge, I can definitely say I am glad I did.  This little beauty gives a great shave, after you get used to the differences in shaving with a safety razor.  The weight and balance in your hand feel great.  If you have not tried a safety razor yet, I highly recommend you do.  And when you do, Merkur is one of the brands of choice.</li>
    <li> This razor is great. The quality is top flight, and you get a very close shave. This was my first safety razor, I use to hate shaving-now it&#x27;s something I look forward to every day.</li>
    <li> Very worthwhile purchase. Works well, solid design. Have saved a bunch of money with this and not having to buy disposable razors</li>
    <li> Be sure the bottom part of the head is pointed down when attaching to the handle. Makes the difference between a nonexistent shave, and a highly enjoyable one.</li>
    <li> As a pretty beardy guy, cartridge razors just really weren&#x27;t cutting it. Sharpness and irritation have not been a problem, clogging of the really closely spaced blades has been. Enter the safety razor. I really don&#x27;t know why society ever switched over. It&#x27;s fantastic. I haven&#x27;t cut myself once. Additionally, the blades are super cheap, though I haven&#x27;t even changed one yet (haven&#x27;t needed to). Though, they are a little harder to come by. Luckily, amazon sells 100 for about $10, and they&#x27;re double sided, so really it&#x27;s like 200.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though, I honestly expected the handle to be a little longer. It&#x27;s called the long handled one! It&#x27;s not short, per se, I would have just imagined that this would be the regular handle, and there would be a version with a longer handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor disassembles very easily. As a side note, Target sells a good kit with a decent shaving soap, bowl, and badger hair brush (with stand) for about $19.</li>
    <li> This razor has a long handle and a nice weighted head that keeps it right on your face. I use it 6 days a week. I wipe it down once a week with a piece of dry toilet paper and it has not tarnished or had any signs thereof.</li>
    <li> Great first DE razor. Thinking of going to an open comb or something more aggressive.</li>
    <li> Great product for shaving my face! I am still learning to use it on my head as I shave that also, but so far it is awesome!</li>
    <li> This is a great razor, the handle length is perfect and the quality of Merkur is notable. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a DE Razor.</li>
    <li> High quality stainless steel from Germany. I prefer the long handle model. I have medium-large sized hands.</li>
    <li> Great razor my husband loves its.  Takes a bit of getting use to but once he got the hang if the shave is much closer, less irritation.  Blades are much more cost effective than disposable.  GREAT INVESTMENT.</li>
    <li> The best razor I have ever use. Been using the blade for 3 month and it still getting the job done</li>
    <li> I just got it, and the first thing i can tell its that this is one good razor, and it goes very well with the astra blades, i just shaved with this one and i can tell that my skin feels like baby skin right after shaving. be careful with the angle and the strength you put on this blade, you can get to cut yourself if you apply too much force and a wrong angle</li>
    <li> Absolutely a fantastic DE safety razor.  Clean it between blade changes with a nylon nail brush and put a drop of 3 in one oil on the threads.  Great piece of equipment.  My first DE, and I am a fan.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor. I&#x27;ve been using it now for about 2 months and I really like it. The seller processed the order quickly and I received it as expected. Original packaging and on time. If you can afford disposable cartridge razors, you can afford to try this. You might like it. It works for me.</li>
    <li> I recently switched from the multi, disposable blade type razors. I have to say that the transition wasn&#x27;t difficult at all. It basically cuts just as well only without any tugging. I have nicked myself a few times, but it was in the same spot as before the switch, so I guess I only have myself to blame. It&#x27;s easy to use, clean, maintain, and you look manly while doing it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very good razor. It costs a bit more than some other razors, but is still at the lower end of Merkur as far as price. I would expect quality from Merkur, and would call them on it if it didn&#x27;t perform according to my expectations.</li>
    <li> I really cant say anything else that hasn&#x27;t been already stated. Great razor. screw Bic, Gillette, and all the other overpriced razor blade companies with there phony battery powered gimmicks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving the Merkur Safety Razor 5 stars.  The razor itself is nicely made and looks great. I have zero experience with DE razors to make a firm comparative judgement one way or another but I&#x27;m immensely satisfied so far.  Part of my review is based on the difference between DE razors in general and cartridge razors.  For my everyday shave, I won&#x27;t be going back to cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 30 years old and I&#x27;ve used a Mach 3 essentially for my entire shaving life.  I&#x27;ve tried every iteration of Gillette cartridge razor, the Schick razors, the store brand disposables, high-end electric razors, you name it.  I always ended up back with the Mach 3 as it seemed to do the best job.  Conservatively, I&#x27;ve probably spent upwards of $3000 on shaving equipment over the last decade which I guess in retrospect isn&#x27;t that awful spread out over such a long period of time.  Still, after reading about the resurgence of double edge safety razors, the fact that after the initial outlay the cost is exponentially smaller, and seeing 2000+ positive reviews on Amazon I decided I&#x27;d get back on the experiment horse and see if I could actually make the switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the process of making this decision I probably watched half a dozen gentlemen shave with DE Razors on YouTube.  I guess it&#x27;s a bit strange but there is supposedly a technique to refine when shaving with age old technology and I wanted to make sure I gave this the best chance possible.  I was a bit turned off by the fact that every single one of them recommended that you shave twice, once with the grain and once against it.  How long do I really want to dedicate to shaving every morning?  Good thing shaving soap is relatively cheap.  I&#x27;ve got fairly sensitive skin and fairly dense facial hair growth.  I haven&#x27;t usually had too much trouble with in-grown hairs or razor burn.  I did early on in my twenties but it seemed to go away later.  My Mach 3 technique was pretty straight forward, short strokes, generally against the grain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 1: Despite my trepidation that I was going to come out looking like Bruce Willis in Die Hard, the shave went decently well.  I lathered up the first time and shaved with the grain.  After inspecting my face I could tell one pass wasn&#x27;t going to be enough.  I re-lathered and went against the grain.  I ended up with only one minor cut on my jaw line and a very good shave overall.  I used an alum bar (another recommendation from YouTube, purchased through Amazon at [[ASIN:B004QVCIKE Alum Block by Osma - 2 Pack Value]]) to &#x27;seal&#x27; the cuts and I could tell there was a few more nicks around my face that I couldn&#x27;t really see because a few spots definitely stung.  Overall no deal breaker and I&#x27;m encouraged to shave again tomorrow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 2: I tried a different pattern on my neck after looking closer at the direction of the grain and figuring it was more sideways than up and down.  Long story short I made a slight meal of it.  I also tried three passes, one with, one sideways, and one against.  Not sure if this played into it but I had half a dozen nicks that I didn&#x27;t have yesterday.  I will be swapping out the blade for tomorrow and probably try the one that came with the Razor.  My first blade was a [[ASIN:B0077LAJT2 Personna Double Edge Razor Blades, 100 Count]] The end result is still a good shave, I&#x27;m not discouraged.  The alum bar is just a bit more important than I&#x27;d like it to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 5: I now look forward to shaving.  The added time hasn&#x27;t deterred me.  The shave is closer at pennies on the dollar.  My cartridge razor will be used only when I&#x27;m in a field environment where I don&#x27;t have use of a sink.  I expect that as my technique grows even that will stop.  Splash on a little [[ASIN:B000053L6Y Clubman Pinaud After Shave Lotion, 6 Ounce]] when you are done shaving and the entire experience is capped off.  Very very happy.he grain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 1: Despite my trepidation that I was going to come out looking like Bruce Willis in Die Hard, the shave went decently well.

    <li> Fantastic razor.  The piece itself is very well made and sturdy.  Very close shave with open razor. And way cheaper than replacement cartridges.</li>
    <li> Most of you are probably not old enough to know that this is what shaving used to be, before the disposable bics came along. Of course in those days they practically gave the razor away when you bought blades. I guess all things do come back into style if you wait long enough.</li>
    <li> I bought into the BS that safety razors are old school and for real men. It sucks. It takes FOREVER to shave your face, misses whiskers on the contours and gives a generally awful shave. If you want a good shave for a special occasion go to a barber shop for a straight razor shave otherwise stick with a Gillette. If you like pretty razors use this, or your girlfriends.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor.  I&#x27;m glad I selected it as my first safety razor.</li>
    <li> GREAT GERMAN ENGINEERING!</li>
    <li> This is my first safety razor and it has convinced me never to go back to disposable razors ever again.  B/c of this razor I started treating my shave times differently.  I think of them as pleasant times to pamper my face.  Getting a proper manual shave requires a brush and cream and although this may seem a lot more involved, which it is, it also makes for a better shaving experience.  At the end of the day, it all amounts to a closer shave with no razor burn and in the long run a much cheaper shave experience (price of razors v. razor heads like on Gillette Fusion razors).</li>
    <li> I like it put would like it better if it would open up when you want to change blades instead of having to unscrew into 3 pieces.</li>
    <li> I used this one time and it just wasn&#x27;t for me... just not a smooth shave. I was hoping to cut down on money spent on razors but I went back to Sensor Excels.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor as a luxurious step up from plastic disposable razors. It appears to be made from sturdy, chrome-plated metal. Unscrew the handle at the point where it meets the head, remove the head&#x27;s base plate, plop a razor onto the tabs on the top plate, and reassemble. Presto, you&#x27;re ready to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because none of the reviews I read happened to address it, let me say something about the &amp;#34;long handle.&amp;#34; In short, it is not long enough to cause a person to think, &amp;#34;Gee, that&#x27;s a long handle!&amp;#34; It&#x27;s about right, as far as razor handles go. Don&#x27;t expect a 3-iron here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why did I buy this razor? I bought it because I enjoy my morning ritual, and it seemed worthwhile to spend $35 on a more luxurious shaving implement. To my delight, replacement razors have proven to be much, much less expensive than the disposable kind. So this a rarity in that it provides me with both a sense of luxury and of economy. How often can you say that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for those who have suggested that shaving with a safety razor is dangerous, I simply fail to see it. I have yet to cut myself with this razor, and I don&#x27;t honestly don&#x27;t expect to do so in the future. Then again, I&#x27;ve never been one to consider shaving particularly dangerous or otherwise odious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it give you a better shave? Well, it gives ME a better shave, because it makes my morning shaving ritual a bit more pleasant. Hey, it shaves well. What else do you need to know?</li>
    <li> I bought one for my self and loved it so much i got one for my dad. Fair warning if you never used this type of razor setup it takes practice.</li>
    <li> Like a variety of my contemporaries, I decided to try safety razor shaving. I am not here to extol the reasons to use a safety razor or provide a how to guide, but just talk about this particular razor. I dove in on purchasing the necessary gear, which is not a cheap initial investment, instead of doing a little more upfront homework and finding some places that have intro/trial gear packages. This is the first safety razor I&#x27;ve tried and I have no reason to explore others. The design is simple and sturdy, likely to last the rest of my life and those of my children. Changing blades is simple and safe. The razor has good ergonomics (as good as one needs). I recommend for a good quality safety razor that should last several lifetimes.</li>
    <li> Great product, exactly as described. Does take some getting used to and like many other users have mentioned, there is NO NEED to apply extra pressure. Let the weight of the razor handle that for you. Also, I&#x27;ve found that when rinsing during shaving, it helps to turn the razor upside down, loosen it a bit and run the hot water on the bottom of the razor as well as the sides. This sounds like a lot but it&#x27;s really not, takes about 5 seconds once your used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, be sure everything is very hot and be sure to stretch the skin while you&#x27;re shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this every time I shave and I&#x27;d be hard pressed to go back to the big box 5 blade razors!</li>
    <li> Had to re-order because the first one got lost in the mail. Amazon was great about it and gave me my money back. Very nice considering it might not have been their fault. Once this one got here it was just as advertized. Works very well. My husband was a little timid at first but after giving it a shot he loves it. Like other reviews say, it is not easy to cut yourself. Seems intimidating but you get over that quickly.</li>
    <li> Love it! Never used a safety razor before but I am extremely satisfied with the quality of this product. The closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had and for ¢15 a blade. Will never go back to cartridge razors.</li>
    <li> Fantastic.  I was a little worried at first using a safety razor, but in using it maybe 20 or 30 times I&#x27;ve cut myself only 2 or 3 times, and very shallow small nicks at that.  I&#x27;m very happy with the close shave, and choice in razors I use (I use the astra, they last for 1 shave only but meh I&#x27;d prefer to change my razor after a shave anyway)</li>
    <li> I love this razor. My only issue is that you have to pay attention to center the blade before you tighten it or you&#x27;ll have more blade on one side. I wish there was less play. All in all, one of the best razors for the money.</li>
    <li> Good quality razor. No issues</li>
    <li> My intro to &amp;#34;DE&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;wet shaving.&amp;#34;  This is a really nice piece.  Hefty, well crafted and easy to use.  I&#x27;m a novice but this razor lets me shave with confidence.  No cuts and a nice baby smooth shave.</li>
    <li> Very nice with a good weight to it, my husband loves it.</li>
    <li> Awesome so much better than razors in store. Money well spent.</li>
    <li> This thing is just really cool, all the way around. Looks like something your grandfather had in his Dopp kit and works better than anything with a half dozen blades - even with their aloe strips. I looked at many razors, and this is the one to get. The long handle made the transition to safety razor shaving as smooth as possible.</li>
    <li> Well made, good chrome, nice shine.</li>
    <li> I wanted to get into this style of shaving, so I purchased this.  I will say its much cheaper that standard replacement cartridge style razors.  And, I would also say the save is closer,  But now, the top piece is starting so show signs of rust on it.  I do shave in the shower with no mirror, so maybe that scenario will affect my opinion.  I just still have a big problem paying tons of money for replacement cartridges, when you can get almost 100 replacement blades for this for like $10, and they will last you for a whole year.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ll slap yourself for not buying this earlier. Fan..flippin..tastic</li>
    <li> Using a straight razor is not as complicated or as difficult as it seems to be! My husband just raves about what a great shave he has gotten with this razor. He watched the guy who posted a video on this site, and then he tried it on a weekend day when he wasn&#x27;t rushed. It was a piece of cake and he says he wouldn&#x27;t go back to the triple blades that gunk up. The blades I got him are also on Amazon...the Astra 100 Superior Premium Double Edge Safety Razor Blades. He really likes the feel of this razor, and how the guy who did the video explained it all which helped a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes new technology isn&#x27;t the better way of doing things.</li>
    <li> Very nervous at first as I hadn&#x27;t used a safety razor for decades.  As I have learned to trust them they are a marvelous razor.  Good solid feel and they clean up in an instant.</li>
    <li> Tired of paying through the nose for cartridges? This is all you need for a good shave.</li>
    <li> Love the razor! The &amp;#34;long&amp;#34; handle had me deceived and a little bit thrown off because I wanted a longer handle but the thing is so small in my hand. Nonetheless I still love the razor. It gives a nice and clean shave! I recorded a video of my first impression when I just received it which you can see on you tube youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;lEYHEy5mylI. Highly recommend getting it :-).</li>
    <li> An amazing shaving machine.</li>
    <li> Holds the edge forever</li>
    <li> It works and is solid to the touch.  But beware, it is NOT a butterfly.</li>
    <li> Men, we&#x27;ve been had. It turns out we didn&#x27;t need all of those extra blades and plastic crap. My previous 5 blade razor would leave the cut whiskers bouncing around between the blades and causing more irritation. I felt stupid the first time I shaved with this razor - it was obviously a better design and a better shave. I still have the occasional knick but its small and clots quickly, unlike the 5 blade massacre. Shaving with this razor for over a month and haven&#x27;t had the bumps once. The best part - 1 razor blade lasts a month and they are incredibly cheap. I imagine this thing will pay for itself in about a year. Never going back to more than 1 razor blade.</li>
    <li> I have very corse hair and needed a razor that was sharp and functional.  This is it best shave ever! Cheap blades replaceed safe annd easy. I cannot use simple disposables more than once as I my facial hair clogs the blades and causes them to shave poorly because of it. Electric razors dulled so fast for me that was a waste. This is it I am loving it so far shaved twice and am very impressed.</li>
    <li> I have been definitely mis-informed. The Machs, and the Schick equivalents all gave me the same type of burns. I finally decided to do research on obtaining  good razor and I ended up looking at this product. This by far gives me the closest shave with no burns. I use this with the Proraso Shaving Cream for the perfect razor burn-free shave. The razors are extremely cheap and they last quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing worth mentioning as a con is that due to the angle of the Razor, it is difficult sometimes to get to the hairs just underneath your nose. If I stretch that area out enough I am able to reach them - but this requires a good stretch.</li>
    <li> The handle is standard length...</li>
    <li> Had a friend recommend trying an &amp;#34;Old school&amp;#34; razor because disposables left major rash and bumps. Used this a few times and now have no intent on returning to 3, 4, 5, or ..... Blades razors every again.</li>
    <li> Excellent razor! My first and only DE razor but it serves it&#x27;s purpose well.  Good weight, good length, and great overall finish. I think the best feature is the EXCELLENT knurling on the handle.  Easily the grippiest knurling I&#x27;ve ever seen and even when my hand is soapy and wet, I&#x27;m never worried about the razor slipping out of my hand.</li>
    <li> I could not ask for a closer shave and cheaper shave. I really don&#x27;t understand some of the guys who have said be careful and mindful as to not cut yourself, Im pretty heavy handed and it has worked flawlessly</li>
    <li> It is a nice $10 razor.  Unfortunately, I paid $37 for it.</li>
    <li> This is my first DE razor and I really enjoy it. The razor is very easy to use and clean.</li>
    <li> Nice and sturdy.  It gets a weird &amp;#34;frost&amp;#34; color/texture after each shave, but not a big deal.</li>
    <li> For my birthday I treated myself with this razor, a pack of blades, the badger brush and the sandlewood soap. Was a Bic razor user for 30 years. So if you take the plunge here&#x27;s a couple of tips to form some expectations with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will deliver an excellent, close shave but in time. It takes some practice and you&#x27;ll learn a technique that works best for you after a couple of weeks. I actually look forward to shaving now which I crazy for me. The shave is so good I shave at night now and it looks better the next day than when I shaved in morning with the old Bic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sold on the Sandlewood shaving soap just yet. Find my face ends up really dry. Have had excellent results though using this razor, the badger hair brush and some regular shave cream. Been wonderful really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch YouTube videos for good pointers too.  It&#x27;s a small fortune to make the switch but it does do a better job than disposable razors. Hope this helps</li>
    <li> Been using this about 6 months now. Enjoying the wet shaving experience with this razor. Creates the perfect angle to cut the beard without nicking the skin. Nice, long handle is easier for those coming from the cartridge razors (e.g., Mach 3, etc.). Some of the other Merkur razors have a short handle, which I find a little odd/uncomfortable. This one is perfect, though!</li>
    <li> Shaves as good as my old mac 3 with less irritation.</li>
    <li> I have used a two blade cartridge for the last 20 years and as I found them more difficult to purchase I decided to try this safety razor.  This razor provided a more comfortable and closer shave, there is a slight learning curve.  The blades are more economical and less impact on the environment.</li>
    <li> I got this razor as a Christmas present, it is the 38C.  I opted for the long handled with guard.  I use astra blades and I originally had the micro touch one (which is a Weishi at heart).  My microtouch had doors closing improperly, the bar across the top mis-aligned with the doors...it was a piece, but a close shaving piece.  That is what I thought until I got this baby.  Closer shave in 1 pass with my Merkur that 3 passes (including across the grain) with my microtouch.  Bear in mind, for control purposes I used the same blade, which had 2 shaves on it, just changed the handle/head.  WORLD of difference, and each drag was smoother than my microtouch, no tug at all.  I had to check to make sure it was shaving!  Highly recommended.  Would (and may buy another) just for travel.  5 Stars!  Best gift ever!</li>
    <li> It takes a bit more care to get a close shave without butchering yourself than with a modern razor. However, the difference in blade price makes it absolutely worth learning how to operate this instrument. The merkur razor in particular is a high quality piece of work. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to buy a DE razor for years. I finally got around to it, and now I&#x27;m regretting having ever used an electric razor. I&#x27;m an adult with acne, and this approach is much less irritating on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP FOR NEWBIES- the fastening base that the blade sits on came packaged upside down for some reason. If you have a lousy first shave, you might have missed this step when you loaded your first blade. Pay close attention to the grooves in the photo and don&#x27;t do what I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Currently using with Astra blades with success. The art of manliness</li>
    <li> If you are fed up with cartridge razors then buy this! i have used everything from cartridge razors to electric and straight razors and nothing has given me a a pleasant shave as this. This is coming from a guy that hates shaving so i hope that means a lot when i say i do like this</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing.  No more ingrown hairs.  No more razor burn.  I&#x27;ve used it about six times now and so far no cuts.</li>
    <li> I waited a long time before doing this review. I bought this razor a year ago and it has served me well. My first safety razor! Love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a Veteran who use to shave in hard conditions where there was no enough water in the vicinities and you have to improvise sometimes. Just Kidding!! I&#x27;m a normal guy that was looking for a good shave and this Double edge safety razor will give you the clean shave that you want. If you are a beginner I suggest that you start shaving downward on your first attempts. If you go against the grain be careful on the chin and mustache areas. You will need a shaving brush, soap, and after shave. Proraso has a good aloe after shave. Showering first helps. I don&#x27;t suggest to fill the sink to clean the razor. Your skin will get pimples or could get irritated because of the bacteria. The Merkur blade lasted me for about 4 shaves. Clean your razor after use and dry. I don&#x27;t know about most of you but shaving with these razor clears my mind. You are going to get hooked and want to shave daily. Also, I noticed that later on you don&#x27;t need the handle to be that long but either way works. The weigh is ok. This is a good nice looking Double edge safety razor. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> This is a good safety razor.  Not perfect, but perfectly usable for daily shaves.  A razor, much like a matching blade, is a personal preference type of thing.  This razor is built pretty good.  I do have one complaint, when inserting a blade you must take care in lining it up perfectly.  There is a good deal of play in the how the blade mounts.  This is a minor complaint to me, but to some it may be a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend this razor.  Sure.  But like I say it&#x27;s a personal preference thing.  Would I buy it again.  Probably not, only because I&#x27;ve tried this one and I would want to try something else.  But that&#x27;s not to say that this one is not good.</li>
    <li> Although I&#x27;m new to wet shaving with a DE safety razor, I do know what I like. This razor (for me at least) is a top notch razor. It&#x27;s sturdy and easy to clean and change the blade. I don&#x27;t much care for the sample blade that came with it, but that is trivial. I foresee this razor lasting forever with proper care.</li>
    <li> I must admit I was quite happy shaving with a Gillette Fusion pro-glide until it came time to purchase replacement heads. I can&#x27;t recall the exact price but it was around $3.50 a piece, are you kidding me?? I also looked into the dollar shave club, better deal but I still wanted to see if there was a cheaper way to get a shave. Went on Amazon and found a wide range double edge razors starting at $16.00 up to the top of the line Merkurs at $40.00+.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve long been a knife snob and will work with nothing but Wusthof Knives made in Solingen Germany. After seeing the Merkur was also made there I choose it over some lower priced models. I examined the unit when it arrived. As expected the machining and plating were perfect in every way. I hadn&#x27;t shaved with a safety razor for over 30 years and was pleased with the results using the Merkur blade that came along with the razor. I&#x27;ve also tried Feather blades I ordered along with the razor and experianced my first cut, I&#x27;ll chalk that up to inexperiance. I&#x27;m working my way through the first of 200 Derby blades and am still satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on my short experiance I&#x27;m quite satisfied. I also believe this razor will be mentioned in my will. I expect it to last that long. 25 years of shaving would amortize down to 1/2 cent a shave, beat that Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason for 4 out of 5 stars is that it is too safe. The built in clearance makes it difficult too get right up to my nose but I&#x27;ve got a bunch of old Fusion Pro-Glide heads to take care of that.</li>
    <li> I love this razor. It is a much better shave than using the three to five bladed razors and much cheaper, too. Keep in mind, I am not prone to razor burn at all (I don&#x27;t even have to use shaving cream), so I am not sure how this would affect those who are as I know the multi-bladed razors do cut down on that. It is great for when the beard gets a little long. It doesn&#x27;t clog up with hair like a multi-bladed razor.</li>
    <li> My nephew is loves his beard and loves this product and the Feather Razor blades NEW Hi-stainless double edge that come in a 10 pack</li>
    <li> My $2 razor gives me a closer shave to be honest.</li>
    <li> I am just getting into shaving with DE razor blades, and this is a great razor to start with. I like the weight and the well-knurled handle. The construction is solid, loading the blades is easy, and I feel I can get a lifetime of use out of this product.</li>
    <li> There are so many positive reviews here for this razor, which is why I decided to give this one a try. I have now been using this razor an average of five times a week for five months and I have not been disappointed. I attribute much of the pleasure of my shaving experience to this product and my Taylor Sandalwood shaving soap. This razor is very well manufactured and I expect that it will last my lifetime.</li>
    <li> 6 months of daily use and abuse - no rust.  Great weight, easy to hold, great shave.  I love this razor.</li>
    <li> More precision required to find angle to shave at but even fewer nicks as I&#x27;ve adapted to it. Less blade is available for shaving so annoying to begin with. Different and sturdier than cheaper safety razor I had to chuck. This one will last a while.</li>
    <li> This thing is great.  The weight is perfect, it&#x27;s easy to clean, and it gives you a good shave.  Investing in this and a few razors will set you up for life.</li>
    <li> I bought this product as part of an Amazon suggested shaving kit for my husband&#x27;s Christmas present. Best thing I could have bought him, as he has very sensitive skin. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> having used this and the edwin jagger counterpart, i&#x27;d say they both cut almost exactly the same; i was not able to notice a difference between the two. however, i believe the jagger looks like a much more polished product and also comes in a fancy box in case you&#x27;re buying one as a gift.</li>
    <li> This handle is makes it readily apparent that you get what you pay for. That cheap $1 handle falls miles short in term of build quality and effectiveness compared to the Merkur brand.</li>
    <li> Being in the military, I have to shave atleast once per day. I reached the point where I was tired of shredding my face with those cheese grater disposables. I ordered this merkur just hoping for a change and I was blown away. I had never tried the whole wet shaving thing, but figured it was worth a shot. After an initial adjustment period of getting my angle and stroke patterns down, I am now experiencing zero redness, irritation or ingrown hairs. The length an weight are what I consider perfect. I have ended up going with Astra blades. Not too sharp, pretty forgiving. The only consideration with this razor is getting the blade aligned evenly when installing,  other than that its smooth sailing. For the price and what you get for your money, I consider this purchase a no brainer. Couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with this razor.  It has &#x27;quality&#x27; written all over it.</li>
    <li> Never used a double edge before. Once I got use to the proper angle you should use. I loved it. Never had a betater shave.The razor is very well made and I recommend the long handle.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband along with an art of shaving kit and he loves it!  There was a bit of a learning curve, but it&#x27;s much better than his old way of shaving.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m entirely satisfied with this product and will never switch back to those trendy Gillette rip offs. Only wish that I had made the switch to the safety blade sooner!!</li>
    <li> Works great, have a light hand and take it slow. Great finish, angle just right. No more overpriced razor blades.</li>
    <li> The best razor i have ever used</li>
    <li> Absolutely Love this razor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this razor because of the long handle, and do I ever love this version. Merkur is known for their incredibly well built and long lasting razors and this one is awesome! Very simple to open and load and the weight of the razor is enough for me to provide a close and clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is well worth the investment, and I would highly recommend this razor for anyone venturing out into the land of safety razors for the first time.</li>
    <li> It has been almost 40 years since I last used a DE safety razor. My Dad bought one for me when he thought I had started shaving. Actually he got tired of ripping half his face off after I had used his razor for something other than it was designed for so he bought one for me hoping I would leave his alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any event, my memories of a double edge were the stings of an alum pencil to staunch the flow of blood. I constantly cut myself. I switched to the early version of Bic disposables and I still cut myself so I went back to the DE safety razor. I guess somewhere along the line I lost it so I reverted to a disposable and have been there ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, it was with some trepidation that I applied my newly acquired Mercur 180 to my skin and with a slightly shaking hand pulled the razor across my throat. As I got ready to apply pressure to the inevitable razor cut, I looked for the blood. I saw no blood. I pulled the razor across my throat again and waited for the flow to start. Nothing again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I completed the whole job without a single cut and it is one close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I freely admit that this is my first shave with my new Mercur 180 so it could very well be beginner&#x27;s luck but so far I can only say it is phenomenal and I don&#x27;t know why I waited so damn long. I am done with disposables. They flat out suck. I don&#x27;t care about saving landfills. I care about my face, such as it is, and in my limited experience, the Mercur 180 is the answer for me.</li>
    <li> All I can say is I don&#x27;t understand where the wheels fell off the bus and men went to disposable razors... Been using a Gillette Mach III for years and not that it&#x27;s a bad razor, but this was the best shaving experience I&#x27;ve ever had. Not much effort differently than a disposable. No cuts. No burn, insanely close shave.</li>
    <li> The razor was great. The blade never made it through customs though.</li>
    <li> As a person of color and military officer I have had to &amp;#34;endure&amp;#34; the agony of shaving for many years.  The moment I switched from multi-bladed razors to double edged razors I actually found shaving pleasurable.  If you&#x27;re a person of color or just simply suffer from severe razor bumps and burns give this razor a try.  Its a $30 investment in your health, pride, and self-esteem.  For best results combine with Bump Patrol aftershave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve reviewed the Merkur Double-Edged Razor Blades on that page, and noted there that at times it seems this, well ... doesn&#x27;t work. But I may be doing it wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my own defense, I&#x27;ve tried different angles, water temps, times of day, shaving creams and soaps ... and still the Merkur only produces tip-top performance when my beard is barely there — no more than one day&#x27;s growth. As for the rest of the elements, I recommend a lathering soap cake, or the Trader Joe&#x27;s cream in an orange tube. And water as hot as you can stand it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have an electric razor, a Gillette (not the Power one; the step down from there), and this Merkur. I&#x27;m not disappointed in any of them, and I don&#x27;t regret having about $150 worth of tools — not counting the blade replacement or cleaning the electric. I&#x27;m cool with it, and, as I say, I could be doing it wrong. But sometimes I&#x27;ll dust my cheeks a bit with the electric, sweep once via the Gillette, and then close the deal with the Merkur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That sounds like a lot of time invested, but it&#x27;s really not, at least for me. But even if it was, that&#x27;s one of the points of getting a razor like the Merkur: you&#x27;re supposed to take your time, feel the shave, and enjoy yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you&#x27;re thinking of this kind of shaving, I believe Merkur is a respectable, perhaps even major, name. Certainly you&#x27;d consider this one along with any others you&#x27;re looking at. It balances well in my hand, and replacing the blades is a cinch. And I have never cut myself because it&#x27;s an old-school razor — though I can&#x27;t vouch for whether I&#x27;ve never been careless ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said: I might be doing it wrong.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for just over a year now. This is my first safty razor and its changed the way I shave!! Best thing I ever did. I use to hate shoving, but this with a little pre shaving oil and its the best thing ever.</li>
    <li> nice and balanced, easy to change blades.  paid for its self many times over</li>
    <li> Seems to be a very good first buy. I am new to safety razors so i am glad it isnt very aggressive.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Dovo Shavette to get the feel for wet shaving for several months now. It worked well enough, but I always found it to have inadequate heft. I felt like I had to push the razor to get it to shave, which is a dangerous proposition. I also have a real straight edge, but I haven&#x27;t developed the knack for sharpening it yet. So I needed something to shave with that worked well, was relatively easy to use and quick, and was not a standard cartridge razor (I refuse to go back).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I settled on this safety and I&#x27;m glad I did. It&#x27;s got enough heft to do the shaving for you, no pushing it and risking a cut. It&#x27;s easy to use and clean, and just all around works great. Anyone who wants to try out a safety razor would do well to choose this razor.</li>
    <li> Over the years I have used the standard multi blade with decent results. It seemed like every few years another blade would be added advertising it to be the best shave yet and like most men I bought into the gimmick. I myself insist on a close shave every time. I hated the way electric shavers would leave a slight stubble so I always went with a wet shave. Only problem was every time I got a close shave it seemed to be accompanied by razor burn. Finally one day I was looking on like for a remedy and it turns out it wasnt what I was doing that was wrong, it was what I was using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Multi blade razors are know for irritating skin and it&#x27;s obvious why. I was using a Gilette Fusion at the time which has five blades and I would pass by the same spot on my face two or three times. Thats a blade running across my face in the same spot fifteen times! Finally I read about safty razors being far superior and I decided to try one. I settled on the Murkur 180 due to it&#x27;s excellent rating along with a good badger brush, stand, blades,and some quality soap. It took me a couple of weeks to get my technique down but let me tell you once you do, you will never want to go back to a multi blade. My shaves are remarkably close and razor burn is not an issue anymore and it&#x27;s obvious why. I still make the same number of passes but now a blade crosses a spot only three times as opossed to fifteen. And it&#x27;s cheaper. I mean way cheaper! Droping fifteen bucks on a pack of disposables that will last you little over a month made me cringe every time. I spent that on a pack of fifty Feather blades. That&#x27;s almost a years supply for the same price. Cant argue with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t recommend this enough. If you are new to DE shaving as I was you should first watch a couple of Youtube videos. That will give you a good start.</li>
    <li> this was part of a birthday gift for my husband and this brand was recommended to us by a friend who uses it.</li>
    <li> It feels good in your hand. Great weight and good for starters.</li>
    <li> After picking up a MicroTouch One with Dorco blades at the grocery store, I wasn&#x27;t sure what all those people on the internet were talking about when they claimed they could get a closer shave from a safety razor than a good cartridge razor, but I wanted to believe it because I wanted a nice close shave without paying $4+ for replacement Gillette Fusion Proglide blades. Based on what I read online I decided to try this razor and feather blades. I am a very satisfied customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t speak for what it&#x27;s like with other blades because I was hooked on Feather the moment I tried them. After some practice, I can get just as good a shave as if I used the Fusion Proglide in about the same amount of time (less than 5 minutes). That&#x27;s a couple very light passes over each area with the grain. It requires more focus and skill than the Proglide, but it really does seem to work just as well with the right blade and I get less irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I want to take 15-20 minutes, I can get pretty much the closest shave humanly possible. I do that by lathering up again as needed and very carefully going against the grain with a very light touch until I don&#x27;t hear the scrape of the hairs any more. My mustache, chin, and neck have pretty coarse hair so the ultra-sharp feather blade is a godsend in terms of being able to get through them with minimal force. People talk about getting cut by the Feather blades but what gets me cut is duller blades that make me use more force to get through those thicker hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And let&#x27;s not forget that this thing just looks awesome and feels great in your hand and is generally just manly as heck. I really enjoy my morning shaving ritual these days, much more than I ever did before.</li>
    <li> Fantastic safety razor!  I&#x27;m new to using a safety razor and was worried about cutting myself, but have had no issues with that.  I&#x27;ve also saved a ton of money already by switching to using this it&#x27;s crazy.  I recommend some Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving cream, it works fabulously with this razor and buy a 100 pack of blades when you find some you like, they only run about $11-15 for 100 blades.</li>
    <li> Seems smoother than the Parker I tried.  Use Shark, feather or Astra blades for best results.  So far no complaints</li>
    <li> I was looking forward to using this razor because I figure nothing could go wrong with the old style singe blade razor.  I was having a hard time finding blades for my old Trac II and did not want to spend any money on a razor with five or more blades.  The razor came in a simple box with no instructions (no big deal, why would I need any) and only one blade.  I inserted the blade and had to turn the handle to tighten the blade into the cartridge.  If I tightened the blade to tight, the blade would not get close enough to shave.  If I did not tighten it enough, the blade may get loose and wreck havoc on my face.  Also, I was really confused about the term &amp;#34;long handle&amp;#34;.  I would like to know what they consider a short handle.  Very difficult to use.  Maybe because I was used to my old Trac II which had a longer handle than the Merkur Long Handle Safety Razor.  I was able to find blades for my Trac II and now get to enjoy a shave without blood.</li>
    <li> Love this razor, best shaving purchase to date, I have saved so much money from buying disposable razors that I would never go back.</li>
    <li> Forget Gillette Mach whatever or any other deposable razor. Going old school is sometimes the best thing to do. This is the best and most closest of shave I&#x27;ve ever had. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Great shaving razor, its been with me for two years now, no complains what so ever! Have a nice weight to it, a bit short but does the job just fine.</li>
    <li> I picked up this safety razor after deciding that it would be cheaper in the long run as opposed to cartridge razors. It&#x27;s a great beginning safety razor with a balanced shave. My only problems with it are that &amp;#34;Long Handled&amp;#34; Is a misnomer and the razor itself is fairly lightweight. The handle could be an inch or two longer and a bit more heft would make it an even better value.</li>
    <li> The perfect razor, I love it. It makes the perfect shave experience, a must have for daily use. I complete recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this a week now, but I&#x27;m VERY happy with it.  I had purchased a cheaper safety razor to try out first, and it broke after about 3 months of daily use.  My previous razor never gave me as close of a shave as a cheap disposable, but for the cost of the blades I was willing to live with it.  I figured it was the case with all safety razors and couldn&#x27;t understand all the reviews that I was reading where people love these things.  I&#x27;m cheap, so I could see the value in it, but I couldn&#x27;t understand why so many people were raving about how they gave such a great shave.  I tried 3 or 4 different types of blades, and even when new they gave me noticeable razor burn.  Given the simple form of the razors, I figured they gave about the same quality of shave, and the only difference was possibly in the blade.  Then arrived my Merkur, and it has since changed my view of shaving all together.  This razor really does give me a better shave than any disposable ever has, period.  I still don&#x27;t understand what&#x27;s different about it, but I get a close shave and no razor burn at all.  The last 2 days I even shaved dry with it to see how it did, and still did a great job with no razor burn!  I will certainly be recommending this razor to others.</li>
    <li> This is review for the ladies. I have very sensitive skin and I have tried nearly every razor on the market. Last year I found out I&#x27;m allergic to phenoxyethanol (most common preservative) and since then I have switched to making all of my products homemade. I make a homemade shaving soap and while it helped it didn&#x27;t end the irritation. It suddenly dawned on me that the little strips on my Venus (for sensitive skin) probably contain the very thing I&#x27;m allergic to. I have only used this razor a few times so far but I am most pleasantly surprised how much better it works than the fancy overpriced Venus razor I have used for years. I watched a few you tube videos and to be honest they had me running scared that I was going to cut myself because otherwise why in the world would you need to have videos. I shaved all over, legs, arms, underarms, sensitive areas, etc and I did not cut myself even once. The razor blade is so well made it just glides over your skin with a light touch. I only wish I had thought to buy this razor years ago. I have much less irritation and am very happy with the results. I&#x27;m glad I went with this razor and not the purple handled one I had also looked at just because it was called a lady razor. It is so easy to change out the blades and the handle fits well in my small hands and the textured grip ensures it won&#x27;t be dropped my slippery hands. I bought a variety of different blades to try out but so far I can&#x27;t honestly see much difference between the Merkur blade this came with and the Derby I just switched out for. I will continue to try different ones just to see but really they aren&#x27;t that much different.</li>
    <li> this razor is good for women like me who tend to be very hairy.</li>
    <li> Product arrived quickly and was as described by the seller.  This was my first &amp;#34;old-school&amp;#34; razor, it has a great feel and weight to it, gives a close shave and will last generations.</li>
    <li> Because 2 blades sounds better, then 3, now how many are we up to 5? It&#x27;s all a marketing ploy by the razor companies, I just finally figured it out thanks to Amazon and other&#x27;s reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far after 6 months or so, I can  use this blade for 95% of my needs. I use a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; razor just to clean up the spots I miss with this, but that could also be my own lack of skill when using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant going to 1 blade, but was sold on the 1st or 2nd use. And, then really sold when I went to go to buy the replacement blades. They are crazy cheap. No more shaving with dull razors because you don&#x27;t want to fork over $25+ for a few blade replacements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I am trying to be eco-friendly and razor is made of metal and the replacement blades use minimal packaging, so that&#x27;s an added bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be a slave to the marketers any longer.</li>
    <li> Beautiful piece of machinery. Works brilliantly. Very mild.</li>
    <li> excellent. buy this and will save lots of money in the long run.. it is better and cheaper than gillete and schick.. It is does twice as long to shave with this  compare to 3 or 4 blade shaver</li>
    <li> This razor isn&#x27;t quite as comfortable as the ones I used to use, but it shaves just as close.  Add the fact that the blades last just as long for a fraction of the price, and this razor will save more than enough to pay for itself.</li>
    <li> had a parker before with shark blades. i really liked the weight of the parker before dropping it in the shower and it broke. I decided to go with the Merkur based on many of the reviews and so far its been great, but I think its been great because of the Merkur blade that came with it. This blade is awesome; I get a much closer shave then I did with the sharks. Just from a handling and grip perspective I wish it were bit heavier.</li>
    <li> Nicely chromed safety razor.  The razor has some weight to it, so you get a better shave without applying pressure, so nicks are less likely.</li>
    <li> 100% would recommend this  product to friends, my replacement for spending 30$ a month on gillette razor blades.</li>
    <li> I love this razor. It feels heavy and durable in your hand. Much cleaner shave than most popular razors and saving a small fortune on the replacement blades. Highly recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> Nice finish, comfortable to handle, not so aggressive cutting level. Just pick up the right blade and you&#x27;ll be satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> I love shaving now and this razor is the reason why! It works great everytime and I was quickly able to get down my technique!</li>
    <li> For some reason this Model just works better on my face. It&#x27;s great quality and feels good in the hand. I&#x27;ve used many types of razors in it. Settled on Derby Extra and Shark Super Chrome. Love my Merkur. Wouldn&#x27;t shave without it. I&#x27;ve tried the Parker 91 and it just seemed I had to make a few more passes than this Merkur. But every face is different. You have to try a few.</li>
    <li> Have reg length one and thought to try the longer for do not have small hands and like the longer handle.</li>
    <li> I decided for myriad reasons to go back to DE shaving about 3 months ago. My first purchase was the Merkur 180 and it has become the standard by which I now judge other razors.  Paired with Feather blades and using a 3 pass method this razor gives an extraordinary shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I since have collected over 20 vintage Gillette razors and, so far, the only ones that may rival the Merkur are my Fat Boys( 1960 &amp; 1961), Gold Aristocrat (1953), and perhaps my Super Speed Flare Tip red(1955) and my 1966 Slim Adjustable.  Of course I haven&#x27;t tried them all yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Merkur is nicely weighted, feels good in your hand, and gives an excellent reproducible shave. It seems to work as well on one days growth as on 2 or 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had to pick just one razor to use this would be it.  As an aside, do yourself a little luxury and pick up an alum block( I like the Razor Rock) to soothe and close your pores after shaving.  As for shave Cream, so far I have used Proraso for sensitive skin and Taylor of Old Bond St.  Both excellent products when applied with a decent badger brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In sum, you can pay more but I&#x27;m not sure you can get a much better shave than this.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband when he wanted to buy a razor in this style from a informercial. After reading a lot of reviews I bought this one, with the long handle because he has big hands &amp; it was suggested by another reviewer to get a long handle as they run short. I bought this in September &amp; it is now March  and  he LOVES this razor. We use regular old fashioned blades from walgreens and we still are on the oringal box of 10. He shaves everyday &amp; uses shaving cream. He never had a problem adjusting or cutting himself, however he was nervous the first time or two. He loves this razor and I love not spending 50 dollars every month on disposable razors. He says he will never go back to the other ones!</li>
    <li> I have big hands, so my only complaint is that the handle is a bit too small for my wet, soapy sausage fingers. But it&#x27;s super easy to clean and maintain. It looks good, and shaves nicely. Razor blades are easy to replace and position.</li>
    <li> I took up this style of shaving about 3 years ago. I&#x27;ve been using several safety razors that are quite vintage. I noticed that each one required a different angle or technique to keep from getting razor burn. Mostly they were hand me downs from my grandfather, a few I&#x27;ve found at antique stores, and a super cheap one from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was reading some reviews on some shaving sites and thought I would give this one a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is hands down better than my others. The angle allows for a great shave and the spacing keeps it from getting clogged. It rinses clean and stays cutting smooth. If your just starting out or thinking about giving up on classic shaving because of razor burn or whatever... wait one more month and buy this instead of that crazy priced set of disposables. I don&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> My first safety razor.  Very high materials and manufacturing.  Perfect weight for a great shave.  I never realized how terrible disposable razors are.  Definitely a good investment.  I change blades weekly, and wipe excess soap residue when I change the blade to keep the razor shiny and clean.</li>
    <li> The Merkur razor is a well made and durable razor, it is a good, solid comfortable fit in the hand and easy to hold.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband and he loves it. He said he will never go back to disposable razors again. FYI: It works great for women too. It&#x27;s the closest shave my legs have seen in 20 years. No nicks, no bumps, no stubble.</li>
    <li> I have suffered for years with extremely sensitive legs. I have tried every combination of razors and shaving creams out there. I spent years paying for expensive Venus brand razors and Gillette shaving cream for sensitive skin. I still had occasional cuts and a very sore wallet. I received my Merkur razor as a gift, and was completely amazed at how sturdy it felt. I shaved my legs with such ease I was amazed. I did not cut myself once, even on those troublesome knees. I will also be saving quite a bit of money compared to the expensive Venus blades. I highly recommend this razor to ANY woman. I have never felt my legs smoother or so free of irritation. Now I&#x27;m convinced my husband needs one, too!</li>
    <li> A short learning curve but I am enjoying my new Merkur DE Razor. Throw in some Silver Blue blades and I am shaving every other day! Fast shipping, great shave, good deal.</li>
    <li> I got this as an intro to wet shave kit.&lt;br /&gt;I actually enjoy shaving now, thanks to the wet shave kit I purchased.&lt;br /&gt;This is a good way to start wet shaving.&lt;br /&gt;I think I will get a straight razor at some point, but this is a good starting point.&lt;br /&gt;Looks nice and looks like it is built to last!</li>
    <li> After being fed up with those 3, 5, and even 6 blade razors I decided to take an old school approach to shaving.  We already know that modern shaving products are costly and they&#x27;re only going to get more expensive and more ridiculous with the amount of blades they&#x27;ll keep adding.  Electric shavers are good in theory but how many things do I need to keep plugging into my bathroom outlet.  Add a woman to the equation and you find yourself charging your toothbrush on the nightstand to accommodate her need for hair dryers,curling irons, straighteners, you name it.  What I needed was something basic, inexpensive, and was easily portable for vacationing and such.  What I got was so much more.  Within my first use I got the best shave I have ever had and after overcoming the learning curve and buying nicer blades the shaves have only become better.  The Merkur has a great feel to it and the stainless steel finish make caring for this item easy.  I did like the sample blade that came with the razor but I feel like I have a better experience with the Astra blades I bought alongside.  The \\&quot;long\\&quot; handle was actually the length of my old Mach5 and just a little heavier.  Make no mistake this a high quality product at a great value and by no means does the word \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; come to mind.  Shaving has moved from a chore to an enjoyable ritual and for less than $20 you can buy enough blades to last several years.  Unless I get brave enough to try straight razors, this is the way I&#x27;ll be shaving from now on.</li>
    <li> I love it! I&#x27;d been blowing through cartridges like no one&#x27;s business. My mother got me this for Christmas, and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever settle for anything less than a safety razor. There was a learning curve that lasted about a week, but now I am having the most comfortable close shave of my life. In all honesty, I now look forward to shaving, and don&#x27;t miss a day. I can&#x27;t remark upon the quality of the merkur in comparison to anything else, but I have absolutely zero complaints. It&#x27;s a simple product that does it&#x27;s job perfectly. If it ain&#x27;t broke...........</li>
    <li> This is a great razor to buy. Not much for me to say here cause its probably already been talked about in all the other reviews. All the hype is true. Buy one and see for yourself. That is all</li>
    <li> Very nice and easy to use. I have since purchased the Futur adjustable. I thought it would be dificult to get use to, but it wasn&#x27;t. I also shave my head, no problems.</li>
    <li> As a disclaimer, I have only been using this razor to shave for about 2 weeks now, so I cannot speak to long term durability. However as someone who has been using disposable razors for many years, I can speak to the differences between the two, which was immediately apparent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as you pick up the Merkur, you can immediately feel the difference between this and your typical plastic razor. Being entirely metal, it has a nice weight and heft to it that you simply don&#x27;t get from your mach turbo glide fusion whatever plastic version. It feels like you are holding a real tool, and gives it a nice manly feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other bonus often discussed in regards to using a Safety Razor is that you can save a ton of money in the long run on blades/cartridges. Again, as I haven&#x27;t been using this for that long, I can&#x27;t speak to the exact amount of money you can save, however I can say that I bought 10 replacement blades for under $10, so even if they last half as long as your typical plastic cartridge, I will have saved some money already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, and most importantly, the shave you get from this Razor is unbelievable. I used to shave in about 4 different directions to try and get a smooth shave, shaving with, against, across the grain, etc. With 1 pass of the Merkur Im fairly certain I got a closer shave then I did with all of the passes I made with the plastic razor, and with a light second pass my face was the smoothest its been since I started shaving. My girlfriend even remarked on how smooth a shave it was unprompted, so there is a clear difference in the quality of the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does take a little getting used to to switch from your typical razor to a Safety Razor, and you will probably need to start slowly in order to get the right angle (somewhere between 30-45 degrees seems the sweet spot) and not cut your face up. However, once you shave a few times with it, like any other routine, you start to get a feel for it and can shave at just about the same speed as you would with your typical razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For added manliness, I recommend getting a Badger Hair Shaving Brush and a bowl of Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream. It really completes the whole shaving experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As one of the cheapest Safety Razors out there, I highly recommend checking this guy out. The only thing you have to lose is worse shaves and overpaying for disposable razor blades.</li>
    <li> it fits perfectly to my face</li>
    <li> This razor has been a great investment and the shave is unbelievable. The only reason I didn&#x27;t rate it a 5 star is b/c I think they could add some documentation on the device for customers that are new to DE razors.  But the product is definately top shelf.  I love my Merkur 180 long handle.</li>
    <li> I have never had a closer shave than this.  It is true that new, inexperienced users need to be patient with this razor blade as it is very sharp.  Once you get the hang of it, however, you realize how wonderful the shaving experience can be.  Very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Be warned - shaving is a very personalized experience. Despite the rave reviews, these did not give me a very close shave and I&#x27;ve gone back to Mach 3 originals. Yes, I had the correct form. No, I did not &amp;#34;push down&amp;#34;. I would only say don&#x27;t get sucked in by all the hype, you need to find what works for you with shaving.</li>
    <li> Just went back to safety razor after decades of Bic disposables and variety of Gillette razors with expensive blades. Bought a cheap butterfly razor, a Parker butterfly and this Merkur.  For me this Merkur is the winner. Using Astra blades and its a perfect combo for my face. What is funny to me is how all these years I forgot how easy it is to use a safety razor and how much of a fantastic job they do. Now that I found the razor and blades that I like, let the savings begin with no sacrifice to quality. By the way I&#x27;m still using can shaving cream.</li>
    <li> I love this razor, I have 3 of them, one for traveling, one in each bathroom, and paired up with the Feather blades there is no way Gillette will ever see a penny from me.</li>
    <li> Not as close of a shave as my Philips Norelco.  Takes longer, messier, cut myself.  I recommend electric.  words words</li>
    <li> I have now been using my Merkur 180 for about two weeks.  The difference from my multi-blade shaves is already very noticeable.  I have a very thick beard, and the multi-blade razors seem to wear out after only about 3 or 4 shaves.  Having used the same blade on the Merkur razor for two weeks, I still notice that it cuts smoothly without irritation.  Plus, when I do have to replace the blade, I will save a considerable amount of money!  I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor after finding there are long-term benefits to double-edged safety razor as far as closer shaves and less waste when compared to plastic-laden disposable razors.  As a beginner, I purchased this model as its from the most reputable company to make safety razors--Merkur/Solingen--and is a reasonable priced model.  The handle length is comparable to a disposable plastic razor, but that&#x27;s where many similarities end.  There are only three parts to this razor--the curved top, the razor support, and handle.  The top screws into the handle and the razor support is sandwiched in-between.&lt;br /&gt;This razor is not adjustable and has a moderate angle--which felt closer than previous Gillette/Schick/store brand multi-blade disposables and I felt the blade quality was higher in double-edged blades available than what is inside disposables.  One other great advantage for men with sensative skin (like me) is there is no &#x27;lubricating strip&#x27; on safety razors--most disposables have these water-activated lubricants that can irritate some skin types. If you want to spend a little more, the Merkur Futur is an adjustable-blade safety razor that has six levels of pitch for the blades--it costs about three times as much as this basic model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit disappointed that the sample Merkur blade&#x27;s side edges (dull edges) are exposed about 2 mm on either side of the curved top piece, which isn&#x27;t as clean-looking, but its virtues far outweigh this one fault.  It&#x27;s relatively simple to clean under running water and replacing blades is easy when you get in the habit of grasping them only by the sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blade choice and shaving lather (low surface-tension soap whipped with moisture using a shaving brush) will make a difference with this and all safety razors.  It&#x27;s important to prepare the beard with warm moisture and follow with warm water and moisturizer or after-shave balm to reduce any irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy shaving, stay smooth gentlemen!</li>
    <li> sturdy. metal. easy to use. easy to clean. not much more to say</li>
    <li> Simply marvelous Digsby.  Simply marvelous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously.  Makes shaving enjoyable.  New to the whole wet shaving world, but this is a really nice feeling.  A very powerful feeling.  A very manly feeling.  [[ASIN:B0007MW2ZW Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream Bowl, 5.3-Ounce]] smells amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 16 May 2016.  I purchased another of this exact one.  The original has held up great over the past several years of daily use, all around the world.  Going overseas again so bought one to stay at home and one to stay in my luggage.  Hard water is not my friend...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strengths:  Strong, simple design.  Quality chrome plating to resist plating.  Nice handle length and weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weaknesses: None noted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendations: Taylor of Old Bond Street is an excellent pairing, still.  I&#x27;m on my fourth or fifth bowl of it.  I&#x27;ve tried several others, including the bar style, and just don&#x27;t like them as much.  S.O. bought me a nice shaving mug that is much better than a coffee mug.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000FIH8XO Edwin Jagger Porcelain Shaving Soap Bowl With Handle, Black]]</li>
    <li> Been using this for about 2 months now and it&#x27;s great. I get a very good, close shave. I go through one blade a week shaving every day and I have a very thick beard. Going this route has saved me a lot of money since I stopped falling for the multi-blade hype from Gillette and Schiek. Going this route is cheaper and you get a better shave with less razor burn&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I use. All bought on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor&lt;br /&gt;Feather Razor Blades&lt;br /&gt;Taylor of Old Bond Street Jermyn Street Luxury Shaving Cream for Sensitive Skin&lt;br /&gt;Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush&lt;br /&gt;Nivea for Men Sensitive Post Shave Balm, Active Comfort System&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trust me you&#x27;ll be happy.</li>
    <li> I purchased this with the Parker pure badger shaving brush and I love them both.  This gives and excellent nice clean shave.  I went with the long handle and I am glad I did.  I am also glad I went with the guard since I had no problems changing from an expensive 3 blade disposable.  The last disposable cost me $25.00 for a set of four blades so this will pay for itself in a few months and last for years.  With 100 blades to a box I will change them out every week and be a happy clean shaved man.</li>
    <li> I used to get a lot of razor rash and started looking for ways to prevent it.  There are a lot of websites that promoted safety razors so I bought this one.  It has cleared up (not totally eliminated) my razor burns and made them less severe.  Some say it shaves closer, although I have no idea how you could tell considering it would only be in millimeters (if that).  Don&#x27;t expect a dramatically closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few tips to use.  You have to shave everyday to get the best impact.  If you have more than one days growth, it is harder for the razor to get through and you will have to make a lot of passes to shave everything off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You also need to change the blade pretty frequently.  Luckily, they are a lot cheaper than conventional razors.  It is pretty easy to know when to change because they drag more and don&#x27;t shave as well.  I&#x27;ve found that they last one to two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this is your first one, get a razor sampler pack because different blades cut differently.  Some blades may work well and some may not for your particular face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes more time than usual because you have to make shorter passes and thus, more of them.  Make sure you make a short cut and then rinse the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very happy with my purchase and am glad I did it.  It seems it will pay off in the long run.</li>
    <li> Has a nice heft to it. Shaves great and easy to replace razors.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that could be better is if the razor was a butterfly opening for the replacement razors.</li>
    <li> This particular razor is excellent. SOLID chunk of metal. shaving with a safety razor has changed my life! (ok dramatic maybe, but really)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is:&lt;br /&gt;1. Cheaper than cartridge razors by far. I got 100 feather blades for 26 bucks.&lt;br /&gt;2. Far easier on your face or legs, I know several ladies who use safety razors too. SR blades are much sharper so they don&#x27;t tug hairs. Also when the 3-5 blades of a conventional cartridge razor pass over your face, each one shaves off a small layer of skin, causing irritation.&lt;br /&gt;3.Much closer shave. Blades are sharp.&lt;br /&gt;4.It&#x27;s undeniably cool. Its also very pleasant and relaxing. I listen to SRV or some other classic rock while i shave. Can&#x27;t beat that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy one. You won&#x27;t be disappointed. Also check out Art of Manliness for shaving technique advice, great blog.</li>
    <li> Nice sturdy shaver. Feels good in my hand. Recommend it.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend likes it for his face but not good for shaving your head, you will cut your self easily.</li>
    <li> My husband RAVES about this razor! Not to mention the savings from not having to buy disposables, you can get 100 blades for next to nothing and according to my husband the quality of the shave is nothing short of amazing! Huge thumbs up in this household!</li>
    <li> Have had this for a while still going strong.</li>
    <li> First time Safety Razor user. Well Made, Easy to use, Good balance. Used with Feather High Stainless.  Works like a charm.  Double Triple Quad and so on. Throw them all away. Old tech works better.</li>
    <li> Great razor. Would highly recommend!!!! If you need a good razor this is the one for you!!!! Try one as soon as possible</li>
    <li> OK, bad pun in the title that I&#x27;ll get to in a minute.  I have a beard and only shave beneath the jawline.  I have used the Merkur twice with the sample blade which shipped in the box.  I found the shave to be remarkably smooth.  The single razor edge at a (mostly) right angle to the skin feels very precise.  I really could feel the edge of the blade so I proceeded carefully.  The head of the razor definitely has some weight to it; I felt that I almost could rest the razor against the skin and let that weight apply just enough pressure for a nice shave.  Very smooth results.  I use Cade shave soap from L&#x27;Occitane which I lather up with a brush and hot water as I think that helps soften the stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Early days yet but my only knock against the razor is the handle; despite the product name I find the handle just a little short for really good leverage.  I do like that the head unscrews from the handle to mount the blade as the three mounting posts seem to keep the blade very secure after the head is re-assembled.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor 2.5 months ago and have used it daily since. I like it very much and would recommend it to anyone, especially someone who is getting started wit DE shaving.  It has a nice balance and is easy to clean and disassemble. My cartridge razors are very jealous of the attention I pay it.</li>
    <li> This is my very first safety razor and it&#x27;s worth every penny. Dont waste your money on cheap safety razors, its going to give you a negative perspective on safety razors. Spend a little extra and purchase this razor, you wont be disappointed. The craftsmanship on this razor is excellent. The longer handle is great, it makes the transition from a Gillette Fusion 100 times easier. I&#x27;m writing this review after using this razor only one time and when comparing it to a regular razor there was little to no irritation, where as when I used a regular razor my whole face was red. The sample blade seems to get the job done, I&#x27;m not an expert in the blades but from research every blade has a different effect on the skin and closeness of the shave. My recommendation for this item is to get a holder so that it stands upright.</li>
    <li> It should be obvious that one can not love an inanimate object, so perhaps to get 5 stars it should be rated excellent, a note to Amazon. Also to Amazon this product should not be placed with a heading &amp;#34;Cache Beauty Supply&amp;#34; rather a separate category for Men Products should be added.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said all men who shave with a razor should purchase one of these, especially if you want a smooth comfortable shave. This razor, if one knows how to prepare a face for shaving, will appreciate the ease of hair removal and the smooth skin afterward. If your barber hasn&#x27;t shaved your face or if you have never experienced a facial shave from a professional male barber you are missing out on one of the manliness experiences of your life. This razor will give you that close of a shave. If you know how to shave you will not experience blood loss, or nicking from this razor, such as you will from those multiple so called blade razors. To enhance this razor purchase use only quality double edge blades. Try it what do you have to lose. S.P.</li>
    <li> I am surprised how good it works. After some practice, no need for the old stoptick. Simple, solid. Couldn&#x27;t be happier. Never had a better shave.</li>
    <li> 3 Shaves in and I can already tell a difference. My neck is loving this purchase. This razor is highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This is razor is everything as advertised and gives a wonderful shave!  I started out blade shaving with a Weishi, which did a pretty good job, but I wanted a long handle for balance reasons.  Then I bought one of the Parker razors and found it to be disastrously defective because the blade would not align properly.  Shaving with that razor was a bloodbath and I sent it back for refund (thanks Amazon!).  So then I decided to try the Merkur and found it to be just perfect.  This razor is the old style that does not &#x27;butterfly&#x27; open.  Blade on this one mounts square and properly aligned.  Smooth close shaves without that rough chapped feeling that I got with the other razors.  This is a good razor and I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have been using a Braun electric razor for some time now and it does a very good job. I had felt for some time now that I missed the old fashion double edge razor. When I received the Merker model 180 I was very impressed with it. It is very well crafted out of some good materials. It has some real heft to it so you need only a light touch when shaving. The Braun is very good but to me the old safety razor style is a more satisfying shave.</li>
    <li> Bought the LH with guard 2 years ago when I decided to make the switch the DE shaving and have not looked back. A great intro to DE shaving. I use this razor with Derby blades and love it. Easy close shaves every time. A short learning curve after switching from cartridges (I needed to exercise a little bit more care around the nose and lower neck) but nothing a styptic pencil couldn&#x27;t help with. Have since bought a Merkur Futur too, which is phenomenal (but requires a bit more of a deft touch). Zero regrets about buying the Merkur LH, it is a wonderful piece of shaving kit.</li>
    <li> My first DE Safety razor, I love this razor. I will never go back to those disposable razors EVER AGAIN !! The price on this has come way down from the 40 bucks I paid a year ago. I love the long handle knurled grip!! I love this Merkur, still experimenting on what razor works best for me, but I&#x27;m having fun doing it!! What kind of DE safety razor should I buy next Hmmmnn!!</li>
    <li> This is a great razor.  It shaves cleanly and is easy to maintain.  I higly recommend it to anyone looking for a high quality razor.</li>
    <li> Very good quality.  You can tell by the weight of it.  The safety feature could have been trimmed down a little giving you a better shave.</li>
    <li> Shaving with a safety razor has saved my face so much torture from the modern multi-blade razors. This razor is nice and long, and feels great in my hand. Its about the same length as my Gillette quattro thing I used to use, so it didn&#x27;t take much getting used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It provides excellent shaves, while only making two passes on my face. With this single blade razor, I can get a fantastic shave with two passes. With my old 4-blade razor, I would make 2 or 3 passes. However, since that razor had 4 blades, I was in reality passing a blade over my skin 8 to 12 times per shave. My face felt raw every time. With this safety razor, I get a closer shave, and my face doesn&#x27;t feel like its been shaved.</li>
    <li> This safety razor is scalping me. I shave my head and face. It isn&#x27;t practical for the head and it is doing damage to my skin that will take at least a week to heal.</li>
    <li> Happy with this razor. Wish I would have purchased a heavier razor.</li>
    <li> This is my first razor. It is solid and of a great design. It helps you get a good system going. I personally use feather blades with this razor. When I first got it, there were some... Mistakes. Learn from them! If you are bleeding, its not the razors fault. Check the blade, check the angle, and try again. Short strokes over taught skin also help. I even find switching hands to do the trick as well... Left hand for right side and vice-versa. With this it allows you to use the closer hand to stretch the skin.</li>
    <li> Great deal, top quality materials, perfect angle, heavy weight, longer handle than others.  I only like comb razors like this one to be able to trim my beard without using a trimmer and shave all in one is perfect.  I have very sensitive skin, and thick tough facial hair.  Even very expensive cartridge razors don&#x27;t stand a chance against my hair, and leave my skin not smooth and irritated.  This guy however, cuts through everything with precision and delicacy.  I seriously couldn&#x27;t be happier.  Take care of it, and don&#x27;t over tighten it and I am positive it will provide years of amazing service and compliments on your shave and skin.</li>
    <li> Ok, I&#x27;ve been using cartridge razors since I could shave. I absolutely hate disposables. So I decided to try to save some money and try a DE razor. I could not be happier with the product thus far, although I have only used it twice as of now. What I can say is it gives an incredibly smooth shave (baby bottom). I noticed with a good shaving soap, it glides effortlessly. I use the Personna comfort coated DE blades. I am seriously considering using it on my head after doing a shave with the buzzers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical, but at the cost to get started, it was comparable to buying an 8 pack of cartridges price wise. And now I can shave for over a year without buying a single thing. Try that with 8 cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cleans easy, doesn&#x27;t get clogged with hair, and feels really good in the hand (heft and length of handle). Seriously just use the weight of the razor and clean as a baby&#x27;s bottom. I cannot stress enough using a  shaving soap instead of standard foam shaving cream. Soaps make water &amp;#34;wetter&amp;#34; and makes the razor glide with no burn at all as well as leave the skin soft and moisturized.</li>
    <li> Well made but I have trouble shaving my legs with it.  My knees were a no go zone unless I wanted to shred them and you need super shaving cream or oil.  I&#x27;m bummed bc I wanted an alternative to expensive razors that are tested on animals but it just won&#x27;t cut it for summer.  I will prob use it again in the winter but I can&#x27;t shave quick enough in the curvy areas for shorts and  bathing suits.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product several months back and am still impressed.  It is solidly built and with either the blades supplied or locally purchased - it gives a smooth comfortable shave.  The Razor is a delight to hold in the hands - it has that satisfying hefty, yet balanced feel, and cleans easily.  One item to note - of no major concern to me - is that the blade is replaced by unscrewing the handle from the top holders, rather than the &#x27;butterfly-opening&#x27;, top loading style.  I own several double-edged blade razors and can highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have had this razor for a couple of years now. I love this razor.</li>
    <li> Fantastic close shave. Seriously.</li>
    <li> Its a razor, it works. Its shiny. Wish the handle was a little longer, handle is pretty hard to grip when shaving. Overall, satisfied.</li>
    <li> I must say I am super impressed with this razor. After tons of frustration with the more mainstream straight multi blade razors from Gillette that clog easily and never seem to get clean again. I was on the verge of trying out dollar shave club or some other means of razor put having in bulk, but decided to give this a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow. I am thoroughly impressed with this razor. I purchased the long handle with the guard. The handle is nice and heavy duty. It&#x27;s great to have a razor that feels masculine. It&#x27;s easy to load the blade and have it ready to go. I recently started shaving in the shower and it&#x27;s incredible how easily it cleans. I have very coarse facial hair and it was like a hot knife through butter. Since it&#x27;s more of a finesse razor, it offers a lot more control at the cost of allowing a person to make some mistakes. I&#x27;ve heard that cuts can happen but I had no problems at all straight out of the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking at taking your shave to the next level by eliminating the frustration that comes with multi-blade mainstream razors you are in the right place.  I recommend treating yourself to this razor, getting a nice lather, and brush, and a nice aftershave lotion to treat yourself daily.</li>
    <li> Flimsy and does not get me a clean shave, which as I am sure you assume was the overall goal.</li>
    <li> I am a woman. And I believe everyone should be using this razor. I am never ever going back to other razors. I use it for my armpits and legs. It is incredible. The first time I used it, I expected to go over the same spot couple of times because that&#x27;s what I normally have to do. But not with this little guy. The first time, and my skin was hairless. My eyes almost popped out of my face. I&#x27;ve been telling my husband, my co-workers, and friends to get this razor. It is amazing.</li>
    <li> Great weight to this razor. Extended handle adds comfort and stability while shaving.</li>
    <li> I already had the 34C and had been using it for years. These razor should have never been replaced by those cheap plastic razors like the Mach 3, Fusion, and Quatro. This shaves very well. And like all safety razors, I have no irritation or razor bumps, ever. Unlike with cartridge razors, which seem to excel only at irritating my skin. This is slightly smaller (but a hair longer) than the 34C, so if you have large hands like I do then you may prefer that one, but I love this one as well, so hell...buy both.&lt;br /&gt;I tend to edge with a Dovo straight razor because I feel that they have more precision, but I use my Merkur safety razor daily, nothing beats it.&lt;br /&gt;Best of luck.</li>
    <li> Decided to give safety razors a try after repeatedly getting razor burn and razor bumps from my Gilette Fusion. First thing you notice is the quality of the item. I cut up my face a LOT the first time I used the safety razor, the second time was better, and now I&#x27;m a pro and cuts are a thing of the past. I use it daily because I&#x27;m part werewolf so my beard comes in rather quick and to my surprise I stopped getting razor burns completely. I still occasionally get razor bumps, but that is my fault because each of those times I decided to go against the grain, which does not suit my face. It takes a little longer to shave with a safety razor, in comparison to Gilettes which you can shave with in one pass; however, with a safety razor you will have to shave your face at least twice to get a good shave. It&#x27;s a little more time consuming, but I swear it is the closest shave I have ever gotten going with the grain. And wow, you save SO much money on blades. 100 blades is ~$12 (I use Astra Platinums), and each blade lasts me 3-4 shaves with no irritation... My Gilette Fusions would last just as long, but I would use them for at least a week with irritation just because they are so darn expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Safety razor shaving is MUCH cheaper in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;No razor burns (at least for me).&lt;br /&gt;No razor bumps if used properly (it depends on your face, really).&lt;br /&gt;You look cool using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NEUTRAL:&lt;br /&gt;Shaving takes a little longer, but you can&#x27;t argue with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;None that I can think of.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to safety razors, but after only one week I am hooked and can&#x27;t believe they lost market share to the &#x27;other&#x27; razors.  This model seems well made and is simple to use.  After only one use I could tell it caused less irritation than my mach 5 or my norelco aqua razor.  In a few days the small amount of acne I usually have which I used to contribute to my physical job and exercise routine really cleared up.  If you&#x27;re on the fence about safety razors watch some videos on how to do it properly and take the plunge.</li>
    <li> The safety razor is a great product, excellent quality and strong. Designed to do what was built if for. How well it work depend of the blades, so if you are no satisfied with your shaving blame the blade no the razor.</li>
    <li> I am a 23 year old guy who has never held a safety (DE) razor before owning this one. As a recent college graduate in a crappy economy, I&#x27;m always looking for ways to save money and still look great (you have to dress/look for the job you want, right?). Well, I was absolutely tired of trying every new razor that promised a \\&quot;better shave\\&quot; with \\&quot;no irritation.\\&quot; No irritation? In my dreams. Even if I shaved only with the grain, used a preshave oil, and exfoliated before shaving, I&#x27;d end up with horrible razor bumps near my adam&#x27;s apple/neckline. Nothing says amateur like razor bumps.  So, I decided to take the plunge and go old school. I chose the Merkur 180 because I read that it was the easiest transition from the multi-blade razors. I&#x27;ve had it a week and haven&#x27;t experience any irritation. No razor bumps. Perfectly close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get this razor and dump Gillette, Schick, or whatever blade you&#x27;ve been using.</li>
    <li> Great razor. My first safety razor, I switched from dollar shave club. Very easy to use and not difficult to shave with.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it. It&#x27;s pretty nice quality for the price and he gets a great shave from it. I really don&#x27;t see a difference between this one and one of the more expensive safety razors.</li>
    <li> A lot of people seem to say that shaving with a safety razor is difficult at first and you will cut yourself often. I found this not at all the case with this razor. However, I did shave with a straight razor prior to this purchase. The razor is very good quality. The shaved hairs rinse out easily under running water. And the razor seems to perfectly bend the blade to just the right degree for a nice close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I found that if you run it under very hot water the top of the razor, which is rounded smooth chrome, will get some heat to it. Not sure if this is good if you want to make the razors finish last forever, but I find it has a nice soothing effect if, after each stroke, you swipe the razor a little extra letting the curved smooth heated portion go over the just shaved section.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would advise that everyone give this razor a shot if they&#x27;re thinking about shaving with a safety razor, but word of advice. Get a sample pack of blades, because everyone&#x27;s face react better to a different blade.&lt;br /&gt;- Some blades are too sharp for my face and nick me occasionally.&lt;br /&gt;- Others aren&#x27;t sharp enough or wide enough so they don&#x27;t come close enough to my face on this razor and take more strokes to get the shave I want.&lt;br /&gt;- Other are absolutely amazing and shave me quick and clean giving my face an almost waxed appearance because of how close the shave and how healthy this method of shaving leaves my skin looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helped your decision and I will definitely getting these as a present for other guys I know that have problems with conventional shaving methods!</li>
    <li> Nice I love my new razor it&#x27;s a close shave and it is saving me almost 30.00 dollars a month because it beats the heck out of one of those Mach 3 that I used to use so more blades are not as good as one!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone from disposable, cartridge, and electric razors and HATING shaving to actually enjoying shaving. I purchased this along with a variety pack of blades, Proraso shaving soap, and a midrange badger hair brush. Razor burn and ingrown hairs are a thing of the past. The process takes longer but is definitely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Merkur 180 has a nice heft to it and is extremely easy to clean, replace blades, etc. Do yourself a favor and make the switch!</li>
    <li> love the product love the price and everything work very well thank you</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful and solid tool. It is a joy to shave with this. It never fails to attract compliments.</li>
    <li> Took some advice from others and bought myself a double-edged razor and I haven&#x27;t looked back ever since. The cost upfront may seem high, but considering that I bought this with 100 double edge platinum blades for the cost of 20 count of Mach3 Turbo Cartridges, this is a STEAL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great close shave, sturdy handle (I&#x27;ve dropped it a few times and it did not break) and great design. Once you get the hang of using this, you&#x27;ll never go back to those brand name razors that cost you an arm and a leg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaves just as close with only 1 razor!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not what expected!</li>
    <li> I had been using a Gillette Fusion for a few years and decided to make the switch to the Merkur due to all the hype behind it. I consider myself a pretty hairy guy and shave every other day (ideally I would shave every day but laziness doesn&#x27;t allow this). This razor is very good, not life changing, but the difference between this and my other razors is noticeable. The blade is very sharp and there is very little tug. The shave is also incredibly close, much closer than other shaves. The blade is very easy to clean and lasts long enough. When you do have to replace the blades it is incredibly cheap, we&#x27;re talking less than a dollar a blade. This is a huge improvement over the $5 blades you need for other razors. Cost is definitely one of this products biggest assets. Now for the bad. This razor does tend to cut more easily than others due to the nature of a single blade system. I may just be shaving wrong but I never had this problem with my other razors. I find that after shaving with the Merkur I have quite a few &amp;#34;micro cuts&amp;#34; which heal rather quickly but are irritating nonetheless. The razor burn with this razor is also worse than with others but this is easily fixed with a decent post-shave lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll summarize the pros and cons here:&lt;br /&gt; Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-very close shave&lt;br /&gt;-very smooth shave&lt;br /&gt;-very inexpensive in the long term&lt;br /&gt;-you feel pretty cool using a single blade razor (a very important factor)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-easier to cut yourself with than other razors&lt;br /&gt;-worse razor burn than other razors&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would recommend this product but I do think it is hyped up quite a bit. It is a good razor, but it isn&#x27;t life changing.</li>
    <li> Consider me a believer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s essentially all I can say about this razor, this newly-found art that has been long-lost but not forgotten. I&#x27;ve always had problems with my skin being overly sensitive and yet I had a beard made of kevlar; my neck especially would look like it was hit with a volley of birdshot after a shave. This is coming from someone who had essentially read up on everything concerning how to prep for a conventional shave. I tried immediately out of the shower, after washing my face, I tried various shaving creams, gels, pre-shaves, aftershaves, cheap disposable razors, cartridges, Mach 3, Hydro 3, Fusion, Fusion Pro-Glide, Fusion Pro-Glide Power etc...to no avail...The results were always the same. The razors would more or less tug on my hair and not cut and would inevitably result in in-grown hairs that would be further irritated by following shaves; a vicious circle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then one day I stumbled upon a DE razor for sale on a deals website I frequent. I read reviews and alot of people swore by DE razors and how much money they were saving and what a better shave they got. I passed up on it at the time but the idea continued to linger in the back of my mind. Finally, after many more months of terrible shaves and a neck that bore the resemblance of a half-exploded mine field, I was ready. I came here and began looking at my choices for DE razors, finally settling on the Merkur 180 merely because it has a longer handle, so making the switch from a cartridge razor would feel the same ergonomically. Very simple piece, 3 pieces total, feels sturdy as sturdy can be, blade changing is the simplest thing in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the Van Der Hagen shave set for the stand and the brush as well as the mug. I ordered some Proraso pre-shave balm, Proraso soap, and 10 Feather blades. I continue to stick with the Nivea post-shave balm as that comes highly recommended and I already had some in my arsenal, it would just fail to repairthe damage that conventional razors did to my poor skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After several shaves I am nothing but amazed. Obviously my first shave wasn&#x27;t the greatest, but with every subsequent shave comes a smoother and smoother finish. I wish I had taken some before and after pictures over the course of a few weeks to show the irritation levels dropping quicker than panties at a strip joint. This thing actually works. In all honesty even if this DOESN&#x27;T improve on your irritation, even IF you get the same quality shave as before, it would have been worth the switch in savings alone...but trust me, you&#x27;ll get the results. Believe me. Also do not be afraid of getting cuts...It does not happen as often as you think. My first shave with the feathers resulted in several small nicks, but my most recent shave drew not a single drop of blood. You will not slice your face off with these, not even close. Do not listen to the over-exaggerations of some reviewers. Take your time, make easy, even passes with zero pressure, and clean your razor often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In closing this is perhaps the best thing I could have done for myself in a long time in terms of grooming. My technique has not been perfected with this razor yet as I&#x27;ve barely owned it for two weeks and yet I&#x27;m getting some of the best shaves I&#x27;ve ever gotten. I can only imagine how many old timers shake their head in silent pity for the current generation as they see various commercials for 5/6 blade razors flash across their screen. With leaps and bounds in technology, sure, things get better; not shaving. This was an art that has been forced into becoming a science for the sake of convenience. We want things done faster and easier. The costs of cartridges have sky-rocketed and the quality of the shave received has gone down...All for the sake of convenience. As a man, you owe it to yourself to have the best shave, every time. Take a little extra time to shave and get yourself a DE razor. You won&#x27;t be saving time, but you&#x27;ll be saving money and you&#x27;ll have a face as smooth as a newborn&#x27;s behind. They had it right decades ago. Don&#x27;t be fooled by any marketing gimmick you see on TV. If more people knew about DE razors Schick and Gillette would be out of business...You can&#x27;t even find this stuff in stores anymore. I&#x27;m almost positive the reasoning behind that is because it would ruin business for cartridge-based razor manufacturers. Luckily I took a risk and came out on top. $50 worth of blades will last me close to 2 years and I will continue to enjoy amazing shaves. Shaving used to be something I dreaded...now it&#x27;s something I look forward to. You should too.</li>
    <li> This razor is all it is hyped up too be, It only took me a few times to get used too, and does not irritate my skin near as much, it does take a little more time and effort, but it is well worth it!</li>
    <li> This is my first attempt with a traditional wet shave.  I bought this razor for the long handle, and the reviews about Merkur razors in general.  This model is weighted perfectly for me.  Holding the tip of the handle lets the head put the right amount of pressure on my face to get a smooth shave.  I would recommend this razor to anyone looking to get into wet shaving.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s already an exceptionally informative review of the Merkur Model 180. I just want to add my voice to the chorus:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every man should own one of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One week after receiving it, I&#x27;m by now completely accustomed to the Merkur. The shave (courtesy of a &amp;#34;7 A.M. platinum double-edge safety razor blade,&amp;#34; available in a 100-count box for about $15.00) is slightly better than the best disposable I&#x27;ve ever used; no ingrown hairs over the past week (a first), no irritation, no nicks, and baby-butt smooth all over. Considerably more precise than any triple-bladed razor, too; edging is a blast, and the Merkur has an excellent heft that aids in precision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This being the case, the fact that I can spend $15.00 for a nearly TWO-YEAR SUPPLY of razor blades is unbelievable. I&#x27;ve been spending literally hundreds each year on disposables (I keep track in a spreadsheet) for an inferior shave, and I have no idea why it took me so long to make the switch. I wish somebody had told me about safety razors 17 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re considering getting rid of the disposables: stop considering and go ahead. You&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve own quite a few double edge razors, and honestly I always go back to this one. Don&#x27;t let words discourage you as this is only a beginner/novice razor, honestly, from the slants, to the adjustable&#x27;s that I own, I prefer the 180 the best. Pair this up with a Feather blade and its the best combo I have tried. Give it a twirl, great razor, great price, and I will never get rid of it. You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> Best for Infrequent Shaves&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shave about twice a week and if I use normal disposable blades they don&#x27;t last long as they fill with long hairs. This is much easier to rinse and then fully clean after shaving and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not going back to any of the fancy razors or disposables.  For me, this works just the same and the cost over the long term will be significantly lower than buying cartridges for my Mach razors.  The Mach razors are such a scam.</li>
    <li> Bought this product with a lot of optimism and that optimism was returned with a perfect quality shave. If your like me its been a long time since i&#x27;ve been on the vice-grip of gillette. I went through almost all the types including fusion. Being a college student i eventually became weary of paying almost 30$ for only a couple of blades. When I bought this product it gave almost the same, if not better, quality shave than my long time friend gillette fusion. On using the Merkur, there is indeed a slight learning curve (expect a few cuts) but after a 2 or 3 times ull be using it masterfully. Those of you thinking about purchasing this product do not hesitate.</li>
    <li> This is my first safety razor, and so far I am very happy with it. Solid feel in my hand, and gives an excellent shave. Simple to change to blades and clean.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by a long time friend that has been using dual edged safety razors for a long time. It has plenty of weight, holds blades securely and is easy to hold because of its long handle. Definately a keeper!</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t bore you to death with a lengthy review so I will just say this: This safety razor has changed how I view shaving. Do yourself a favor and stop paying for expensive cartridges that give inferior shaves. Look no further than this razor. There is some upfront cost, but the replacement blades can be found for as little as five bucks for ten blades and this product will pay for itself in no time. From someone that shaves daily, I can&#x27;t recommend this razor enough. Brilliant!</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Well, do you like it?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;We will see just how many times I cut my face.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Well make sure you let me know.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This is a well made razor that produces a good shave. It has a long handle that will be familiar to folks moving into wet shaving from cartridge razors. Only one caution, the razor is fairly light which may cause the user to press too hard against the skin.  That will cause razor burn and nicks for sensitive skin types. Other than that, I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Nice to have a safety razor again.  Superior to the disposable ones offered locally.  Still getting use to the handle and feel of the shave.</li>
    <li> A little background.  I&#x27;ve been using an electric shaver (Braun activator series 7) for years and have always used disposable razors in addition, to shave the neck area as the electric was not sufficient alone.  It got to a point where I hated to shave. I would shave every other day in order to avoid skin irritation from shaving.  So I did the research and decided to purchase this safety razor as a stepping stone to eventually using a straight razor.  Its been a few months now and I&#x27;ve decided to stick with this as I&#x27;m very happy with my results.  I literally can&#x27;t wait to shave every morning and I no longer have the five o&#x27;clock shadow.  No razor bumps, no skin irritation.  For this price you can&#x27;t beat it.  The quality is good and it shaves very close and thus far is going far above what I expected it to do.  Some tips for beginners, prep your face well.  I use the proraso pre-shave cream or shave secret oil along with the proraso shave cream with a badger brush.  Make sure when using the brush to make circular motions as you allow your hairs to stick up to get the closest possible shave.  The key to getting a great shave and preventing cuts is pressure.  You don&#x27;t need as much pressure as you think. Let the razor blade do the work, not you.  After you shave once going with the grain, you can reapply the shaving cream and shave again against the grain.  Finish the shave off with a cold water rinse to close your pores and use the pre-shave cream again and you are done.  No razor burns, no irritation.  Always rinse the razor after each stroke, and take your time.  Don&#x27;t rush, or you will cut yourself. Lastly, change the blade weekly regardless of how it is performing, don&#x27;t take a chance of irritating your skin.  I personally use the Derby blades, I get a closer shave with them versus the Merkus blades.  I would suggest buying a sample pack and finding the blade that best suits your face.  Overall, excellent razor.  You will never go back to using an electric or Gillette disposable blades again.  The only draw back is if you travel, you can&#x27;t bring a safety razor in your carry on luggage.  Like me, after using this razor you might starting having fun shaving again!  Good luck.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this razor and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t cost three fortunes to replace the blade and there isn&#x27;t a lot of waste to it.  The &amp;#34;long handle&amp;#34; seems a little short still so I&#x27;d hate to see what the short/regular handle looks like.&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to replace blades and will take many different brands so you can figure out which you like best.&lt;br /&gt;Does only come with one blade.</li>
    <li> Amazing for price. Beats the blades sold at the mall for double the price.</li>
    <li> I was tired of buying the expensive triple and quadruple disposables and wanted to get crafty with my shave so I bought this.  It&#x27;s true what they say about not applying any meaningful pressure and shaving in short strokes and rinsing frequently.  You have to have the angle right also.  But when you do it right you can hear the hairs getting chopped.  I did shave against the grain but I did the same with the disposables as well so everything was the same except the razor and this thing totally wins.  It does take a little longer but it&#x27;s very enjoyable to use.  I also used the good Proraso shaving cream that comes in a green and white metal tube along with the Proraso after shave.  I feel like I need to charge myself for the professional shave I gave me.&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:  Make sure you assemble it correctly as I had the base flipped and it wasn&#x27;t cutting at all and was VERY disappointed at first then figured I&#x27;d flip the base and ba boom it shaved like nothing I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Now I understand what my father and grandfather already knew -- that there&#x27;s no substitute for an old-school, quality shave!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forget electric shaving (the worst shave of all), and forget about wasting tons of money on overpriced \\&quot;disposable\\&quot; blades/shavers like the Mach Fusion and the like.  At best, I could obtain satisfactory (not good) results with the latter while shaving in the shower, but at great expense (wasting water/replacing expensive blades).  And, all the while, I still had to deal with razor burn (five crappy blades rubbing across my skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going \\&quot;old-school\\&quot; turned what used to be some utilitarian chore I had to get through every morning, into an \\&quot;experience\\&quot; that I enjoy every day -- and I get the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had!!!  And, trust me, my wife will certainly attest to that last part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the best part is that you get this while only spending a FRACTION of what \\&quot;modern\\&quot; shaving currently costs (with a much better, comfortable, and closer shave).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Safety Razor - $60.00 - will last a lifetime&lt;br /&gt;Shaving Brush - $14.00 - I&#x27;m using a Tweezerman Badger brush&lt;br /&gt;Blades - $8.00 every two years - I&#x27;m currently using Astra DE&lt;br /&gt;Shaving Soap -- about $10.00 every year -- I&#x27;m currently using Proraso&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, putting aside the cost of a $60.00 razor and $14.00 brush that will last you a lifetime, you&#x27;ll spend about $14.00 per year for razors and soap.  How does that stock up to what you&#x27;re paying now???  And the best part is that you&#x27;re getting a better shave than you&#x27;ve ever had -- outside of a straight-razor shave from a barber, that is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This a review from a guy that&#x27;s gone old-school and is never, EVER, looking back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. My wife was so impressed with my results that she bought one for herself, and is very, very happy.</li>
    <li> Perfect I&#x27;ll never go back to that old grocery store disposable razor kit again.</li>
    <li> When I was a kid this is the type of razor my father used.  I think he still has it.  After forty years of shaving with a disposable, I have really enjoyed using this razor.  It might have to do with the soap dish and shaving brush I bought as well.</li>
    <li> I got really sick of disposable razor prices. I also got really sick of hearing about how my guy friends were using these AWESOME razors with blades they could buy by the 100s for $6.00. It&#x27;s an INITIAL investment but you&#x27;ll never be sorry you made it. AND I find it takes just as much time to use this razor as it took me to use those disposable razors! I LOVE how smooth my legs feel after I shave with this razor and I use a new blade every other time I shave, more or less. I am not AS concerned with the shave product as some other reviewers seem to be. I use Dr. Bronner&#x27;s shave &amp;#34;liquid&amp;#34; -- it&#x27;s kind of a liquid that lathers up and it&#x27;s MINTY so it feels amazing when you&#x27;re done (just like the mint castille soap). Not that it matters, but you get some serious &amp;#34;bro-points&amp;#34; when your guy friends see you&#x27;re using one of these - yeah, you&#x27;ll be THAT girl. :D</li>
    <li> I was afraid to use this type of razor since the only ones I&#x27;ve ever used have had moving heads and multiple blades. This razor is actual better than the ones I had to constantly replace. It&#x27;s super easy to use on underarms and legs! I&#x27;ll never use another razor.</li>
    <li> Seriously, i&#x27;ll never buy anything but a Merkur again. I love this DE straight razor and would recommend it to anyone wanting to switch over from cartridge razors. It is very sturdy and has a nice weight to it. The Astra blades I use work great with it as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read so many reviews waxing poetic about the sublime experience and adventure of shaving with a safety razor.  I don&#x27;t think it means what they think it does.  It&#x27;s a shave for heaven&#x27;s sake, you do it every day, if that is an &amp;#34;experience&amp;#34; I would advise you to look up the definition or rethink your life, maybe raise the bar a little higher?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a good razor, it shaves well and closer than some of the multi-blade razors BUT it does take more time.  You really can&#x27;t rush the shave without risking lots of blood loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can help you have a good close shave and its a lot cheaper per shave than the multibladed alternatives.</li>
    <li> I finally bit the bullet and got this razor after deliberating for ages about what to get; vintage, new, straight razor, safety razor, etc.  I&#x27;m so happy with this razor.  It looks vintage, it feels new.  It cuts like...well...like a razor.  It&#x27;s very balanced and comfortable in the hand. It&#x27;s easy to operate, solid, and seems like it&#x27;ll last decades.  I&#x27;d recommend this for anyone new to this world of razors.  At the very least, you&#x27;ll have a really solid backup if you decide to get something else down the road.  At this price, you can&#x27;t go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have incredibly sensitive skin in one swirly patch on my neck.  Every razor, every time, this area gets irritated.  I resorted to growing a beard so I didn&#x27;t have to deal with it.  Well, I&#x27;m happy to say that I just shaved with this Merkur and I&#x27;m fine.  For the first time as an adult (I&#x27;m 40), I have a slick, smooth neck, with no razor rash.  I&#x27;m so happy, I want to shave again!  My $15 vibrating Ultra Quad Extreme Power Super Awesome 5 blade with disposable blades is going in the trash.  NEVER AGAIN!  My dad has been right for 50 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:  My dad&#x27;s old safety razor had a screw bottom that opened the top/guide for the razor replacement.  This razor does NOT do this.  The top/guide actually screws off, the blade goes on, then it screws back on.  Easy, simple, solid, just not the way my dad&#x27;s worked.</li>
    <li> When I was in High School, Gillette mailed me a razor for my 18th birthday. Almost 20 years later I have been buying the expensive replacement blades. As a big Amazon buyer I came across this razor and thought I would give it a shot. I was real skeptical because I have a very sensitive face. I have now been using this for over a week and I have had no skin irritations and great close shaves. Before I ordered my razor I watched several youtube videos on how to shave with these razors. The best tip I can offer is to hold the razor at the very bottom of the handle. This will prevent you from pressing too hard on your face.</li>
    <li> I like this razor its nice looking and works well. It is very well built and uses the typical 2 piece head design with the handle holding everything together. My only complaint is I wish it were a bit heavier. Dollar for dollar you&#x27;re probably better off picking up a vintage Gillette slim.</li>
    <li> Razors and shaving have been a bit of a trick for me for years.  Cheap disposables are prone to cause razor burn and, more often than not, nick and cut as if one were shaving with a piece of scrap steel.  The multi-blade razors - two blades; three blades; three blades and the magic swivel - are all pricey gimmicks.  They clog, are difficult to clean, and the lubrication strip (that doesn&#x27;t really lubricate) inhibits multiple uses of the razor.  I endured similar issues with electric razors as well.  They either missed spots, partially cut hair, or caused micro-cuts that really smart.  I tried one of those online shaving clubs and, although the prices are decent, the quality of the razor handle is marginal at best.  The one I had was broken during a recent vacation and I had to shave by holding the blade cartridge with my thumb and fingers.  I had been curious about a safety razor for years and finally took the plunge after reading numerous reviews and opted for the Merkur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bad boy is amazing.  It has quite a bit of mass which allows for more control and a better shave.  The safety razor blades and also the design of the head are what make this razor so effective.  It will take a first timer a bit of practice to get the hang of using this razor, but after three or four shaves you&#x27;ll understand why your father or grandfather always used one.  The other secret is to eschew shaving cream and use shaving soap.  I have been using CreamO with this razor and have never had such a close, smooth shave in my entire life.  I plan on graduating to a shaving cup with the proper soap and applicator brush, but for now CreamO works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stock Merkur blade that comes with this razor worked great for me, but as other reviewers have stated it is necessary to try different brands of blades.  I purchased some sample packs from different manufacturers that are comprised of five blades per back.  The consumer is still saving money at a costof $10 for several sample packs versus a package of the fancy blades for a Gillette twin blade or triple blade razor.  Once the right blade(s) is/are found, the cost of shaving is greatly reduced to just pennies per blade.  Also, the Merkur is easy to disassemble and clean, plus cleanup is a breeze.  This allows for up to three or four uses of a blade, depending on the toughness of the user&#x27;s beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so impressed with this razor that I plan on buying two more to give as gifts to a couple of close friends for Christmas.  Pay for the razor and save money in the long run.</li>
    <li> This is a good basic razor</li>
    <li> I am new to the safety razor way of shaving. After much research I decided on the Merkur 180. It fits perfect in my hand. I find the longer handle gives me better control and helps me find the perfect shaving angle.  High quality and good weight.  The sound the razor makes as it slices effortlessly through my beard is so much better than the standard multi blades.  I will never again go to the expensive multis again.  Using a high quality badger hair brush, shave soap, and razor such as this actually makes shaving a pleasure again.  Yes it does take a little longer to prep your beard properly and shave this way but hey, you gotta do this every day you might as well take your time and enjoy the process.</li>
    <li> Cant say as I care too much for the long handled razor. Nothing wrong at all with the quality of it, just my personal preference. I think perhaps it is easier to put too much pressure on it while shaving causing razor burn.</li>
    <li> Nice, heavy razor with good balance.  Shaves well without applying any pressure.</li>
    <li> Nice and heavy. Beautiful. I hope to use this for many years to come.</li>
    <li> This razor and a box of feather blades is glorious. Small price to pay for an item that will be with me functioning perfectly for the rest of my life and possibly beyond. Have several DE razors and this is always my go to.</li>
    <li> This is my first safety razor so that being said I can&#x27;t tell you if it&#x27;s better then others but I love this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a woman and have wanted to try a safety razor before but was pretty intimidated by them, well more of the process of using one really. Most of the &amp;#34;how to&amp;#34; info is written for men so warm towels, shaving cream, good lather, correct angle, etc, etc. What? I didn&#x27;t want to deal with all that! I want to shave my legs and get out the door. Because of this it took me a long time to finally decide to invest in a safety razor. I saw a Merkur in a store while on vacation and was so impressed by the quality I ordered it when I got back, I am so glad I did. It is so much easier to use then I thought it would be. I still don&#x27;t quite get the right angle around my ankles so I normally have to go over that area several times, but other then that no complaints, and that complaint is really just operator error.</li>
    <li> Great razor!  Easy to grip and guide.  I just have to find the perfect blade to pair it with.</li>
    <li> Better than expected. Very simple to use especially if trimming around a mustache or goatee</li>
    <li> I bought this product based on it being one of Amazon&#x27;s #1 best sellers. It&#x27;s a good entrance to wet shaving at a reasonable cost. However, I do like the Merkur 34c better because it has a more traditional (shorter) length handle, which makes it easier for me to shave with. With wet shaving, you&#x27;re suppose to let the weight of the razor do the shaving (holding the razor with only a few fingers at the very bottom of the razor handle) and not apply additional pressure. However, I find the longer handle makes me want to use this like a cartridge razor. I just don&#x27;t see the need for the extra length of this handle, but I&#x27;m extremely happy it introduced me to wet shaving with a double edge safety razor. Much closer shave that with a cartridge razor for a fraction of the cost!</li>
    <li> Believe it or not even though this is a mans razor I use it on my legs and have never had a better shave.</li>
    <li> Just decided to start using a DE razor. Glad I did. Much better than those triple type blade razors I used for years. Smoother closer shave.</li>
    <li> I never used a razor like this before... always the fancy ones on TV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with my purchase though. It takes me about 50% more effort to shave, but I get significantly better results with this. My face is typically irritated by shaving but it doesn&#x27;t seem so bad after using this razor for a month or so.</li>
    <li> Fantastic Razor. All you have to do is find the blade that works best for your type of skin..</li>
    <li> This is my first safety razor and it works great.  Product arrived in excellent condition.</li>
    <li> This razor is great for the beginner!  It is very forgiving for a safety razor and is very easy to hold if you like the traditional cartridge razor.</li>
    <li> Mekur long handle razor make for a great shave,,,</li>
    <li> Love this thing! Very solid and feels good in my hand. I had no problem transitioning from expensive disposable razors to this. I am new to wet shaving. I look forward to shaving each morning.</li>
    <li> I love this razor. It gives me a close shave, is very cost effective, and most importantly makes me feel like a man and not some axe-body-spray-wearing-disposable-razor-using-kid. I&#x27;ve had mine for a year now and it still looks brand new. Adjusting my shaving technique was a non issue. I would suggest this razor to EVERY man. It is also a super gift idea.</li>
    <li> Very good razor well built</li>
    <li> just lke the good old days</li>
    <li> Great product, high quality</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of this safety razor, i purchased it with the merkur combo pack of 30 blades and this lasted for well over a year with solid shaves.  Over time a small portion of this blade rusted and broke off, however merkur warranties their razors for either 1.5 or 2yrs (I forgot) but I was just under the cusp so I sent them a copy of my amazon invoice and they sent me a free replacement part.  Cant argue with that customer service! would recommend.</li>
    <li> I am saving sooooo much money by using this method of shaving. This feels of great quality. It takes a little more time to shave with this verses cartridges but for the amount of money I&#x27;m saving its ok.</li>
    <li> Cartridges are expensive and I hated buying them.  So after researching and reading several reviews decided to give this razor a try. I am sold. Combined with Derby blades, this gives me the shave better than the Hydro 5 I was using. I use this on my face and head which did take some practice but now can shave my whole scalp with no nicks or burn. Looks good, handles good. I likes a lot!</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying this is my first Straight Edge Razor.  I only used it a couple of times, so I may edit this later, but it seems to be a very good build quality and has a very good feel in the hand.  With that said, it is pretty dang heavy in comparison with what most could consider throw away type razors.  I.E. - My previous razor, the Mach 3 Turbo.  I have to mention that I am kind of a cheap-o, so I have tried to make this trial some what scientific.  After shaving my head and face twice, the one side I have used of the dual sided razor is still razor sharp, and I can probably still get at least 2 more full shaves out of that one side.  For those mathematically challenged, that Is 8 full head/face shave with the dual edge razor.  Who&#x27;da thunk?  With the &amp;#34;Throw Away&amp;#34; razor, if I were luck I might get two full saves out of, so I am thinking this seemingly expensive &amp;#34;Handle&amp;#34; will pay for itself rather quickly.</li>
    <li> This razor shaves very well for me. The long, knurled handle is a bonus for my large hands and the balance is nice. I&#x27;ve been shaving for months now with this, and it&#x27;s a great quality, solid razor.</li>
    <li> I bough this razor about 9 months ago after extensive research and trying other razors. The Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor is well made,  feels great in the hand, and gives a great shave. I would highly recommend this razor to anyone new to safety razors. There was nearly zero learning curve with the product, the blade is protected from cutting you if it is not at the right angle, which is very easy to find.</li>
    <li> This was my first DE razor. I like it and have no problems. I get a smooth shave every time.</li>
    <li> As someone who shaves my head daily I love the close shave this razor gives me. Now I only use the Gillette Fusion (flexball) proglide when I&#x27;m in a hurry.</li>
    <li> I started my &amp;#34;wet shaving&amp;#34; life about a year ago at the age of 34 with a brush and some good shave cream (AOS). I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference from using the junk that comes out of a can from your average grocery store. Well, a year later I finally got the courage to move to a DE razor, and once again I am amazed at the difference! I now get closer, smoother, more comfortable shaves than I EVER got from a multi-blade cartridge razor. One suggestion I will give is to buy a variety pack of razors because I have found some that work wonderfully with my beard and others that do not.</li>
    <li> Appears to be good quality,feels good in the hand.  Delivered quickly, and on a Sunday too.</li>
    <li> Good grip, greate quality and amazing price&lt;br /&gt;If you are starting with wet razor this is your choise</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Combined with super-sharp blades it gives a close shave without any damage to the skin. Most of the time I finish shaving without a hint of razor burn. The razor comes with a single blade, so plan accordingly.</li>
    <li> A very precise razor for a good and clean shave. Comfortable long handle makes it easier to shave the neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Easy to insert blade&lt;br /&gt;Clean shaving&lt;br /&gt;Easy to rinse&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;I cannot think of any issues I have with this shaver.</li>
    <li> Solidly made, cuts close; makes me actually want to shave. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone sick of paying out the rear for razors. Easy to clean, easy to use; haven&#x27;t cut myself.</li>
    <li> This was my first razor as I entered the world of classic DE shaving. The longer handle made the transition easier while the 3 piece design made cleaning and blade swapping simple. Anyone looking to get away from overpriced cartridge blades should give this a serious look.</li>
    <li> I purposefully waited a long time to write this review because I have struggled with ingrown hairs and irritated skin since I first began shaving. I have always had sensitive skin and thought that I was going to have to settle with bad shaves. It was either get a close shave and get very irritated skin and ingrown hairs or have rough stubble even after shaving to spare my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the Merkur for 2 years now and straight away you know you&#x27;re getting into a different level of shaving. I purchased this razor, a badger hair brush and shaving soaps all at the same time. Also I stuck with Merkur razor blades. You have to be willing to spend 2-3 minutes to build a lather and do a little bit a cleanup afterwards, but if you spend the time and enjoy the process you won&#x27;t get a better shave with any other method.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted, with great quality.</li>
    <li> Best razor I&#x27;ve ever used, so fare it&#x27;s my first Merkur safty razor, it&#x27;s a lot more fun to use then the (New multi blade razor) and ease to clean and sanitize! no wonder I had so much irritation  infection, ingrown hairs. With the so called step forward with multiple Blad razor!.  No complaints I don&#x27;t read 5 stair reviews, so 4 Stairs, worth FIVE STIARS!.</li>
    <li> So long Gillette...this gives the best shave ever.</li>
    <li> I got tired of wasting money on plastic disposable razors, and decided to give this a try.  I am very happy with this razor.  I&#x27;m a lazy shaver (only once a week) and this razor doesn&#x27;t gunk up during shaving like the 2-5 blade disposable style razors.  Plus, the blades for this seem to last longer.  Razor is very sturdy with nice non-slip knurling on the handle.  Don&#x27;t see why this won&#x27;t last a life time.  Far superior than the plastic disposable razors!</li>
    <li> Love love love this razor. Pro-tip, do not press as hard as you would with a disposable-type razor. You will cut yourself. Much easier to clean than a disposable.</li>
    <li> Got it as a gift for my father in law and he loved it. I would have gotten one for myself but I only got 4 hairs to shave on my face</li>
    <li> Nice quality, works good.</li>
    <li> The razor does what it&#x27;s meant for.  The blades that came with, Merkur, were NOT very sharp.  I gave this one to my relatives to try and purchased a Feather DE razor with feather blades.  That combination is unbelievable.  SUPER sharp and comfortable.</li>
    <li> This was a blast from the past.  I used these as a youngster and had completely forgotten about safety razors until I read an article that reminded me.  I love this and it shaves so much better and the blades cost so much less than the disposables being sold now.  My daughter, in her 20&#x27;s loves hers also.  Much, much better way to shave.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and very clean shave compared to others that I have tried</li>
    <li> Was a little wary when purchasing this razor...I was so used to what I had been using for years, but it just didn&#x27;t make any sense when it came to how much I was spending on cartridges! Took some advice from a friend and purchased this bad boy with extra razor blades. I&#x27;m never going back!!! A clean shave every time (if you&#x27;re patient, it takes some getting used to since this is the REAL DEAL! You can&#x27;t just fly over any area because you will get knicked!!), smooth and easy to maneuver!</li>
    <li> I will never by a disposable razor again.  I get closer shaves, easy cleaning and a fraction of the cost.  I had purchased the 16 blade sampler pack and tried them all.  You would not think it, but they are very different.  I fell in love with the Astra Superior Platinum.  They have a great balance between sharp and durable and they are cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is not much to say about this razor.  It is all stainless steel, it feels very solid in your hand.  I can see someone buying this at an estate auction 100 years from now still in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and change blades, and I like the longer handle</li>
    <li> This safety razor has the perfect balance. It&#x27;s solid and heavy in the hand. Blades for this model are incredibly inexpensive, and it shaves great.</li>
    <li> It feels like a high quality tool. The heft, the smoothness of the machining, it reeks of quality and simplicity.</li>
    <li> I am somewhat pleased with the product, but not completely. I think I expected a bit more of it, since I am not satisfied with its performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have gotten the hang of it, the trick to using the razor, I believe. But my dissatisfaction with it comes from the fact that I find that the hair tends to grow back faster when using this product, compared to using the other razor I own, Gillete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find myself having to shave more often with this product, and you could say this is more of a hassle since it is more time -consuming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other problem I have with it is that I tend to get irritation on the area shaved. I do make sure that the razor is thoroughly cleaned before and after its use. As well as washing the area to be shaved, plus prepping it with shave cream and applying after-shave once I finish. And still, I always get irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I DO love the fact that I barely get any cuts using it though!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this was a so-so buy. For the price, my expectations were not fulfilled and instead, I was disappointed. But at least I feel very comfortable using the razor as I am very reassured that it is safe to use as I do not get any cuts with it.</li>
    <li> I love my razor. This is my first safety razor and it was extremely easy to get use to shaving with. I love the weight and the size of this safety razor. I will never have to use some ridiculous mach 25300 millennium star blazer razor ever again. I always take the top apart after shaves to make sure water doesn&#x27;t stay inside and rust anything.</li>
    <li> A thing of beauty. Nice finish. Won&#x27;t rust. Holds the blade at a perfect angle. Won&#x27;t cut you if you pull it straight. I was new to this style of shaving and bought a cheapo silver tone first. Do yourself a favor and buy this. Your face will thank you</li>
    <li> Great razor.  a great buy</li>
    <li> Still holding up perfectly over a year later. Seems to work best with Personna blades, replaced within three uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from that, what&#x27;s there to say? It has three parts and keeps my face smooth. Clean it in water after every use, break it down to dry, and you&#x27;re good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, here&#x27;s a fun trick. If you use a wet rag when you shave, keep a dry one to put your razor parts on. When you travel, wrap the dry rag around your razor so nothing gets damaged. Tested and works.</li>
    <li> Great razor-nice feel and balance</li>
    <li> Class A Product. Make sure you know what you are doing with this. Very sharp.</li>
    <li> got tired of spending 30 bucks a couple times a year, went old school.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of safety razors and I think this is my favorite. The slightly longer handle works for well - my girlfriend actually took my first one to use on her legs because of the better reach and control. It isn&#x27;t as heavy as some which I enjoy, but the grip is very slender which might throw you off if you have larger hands. I do my shaving in the shower and the textured grip is a godsend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be aware, this isn&#x27;t a standard butterfly model, so you might get some internal corrosion at the points where the pieces connect if you leave it in a wet environment too long. The stainless steel exterior doesn&#x27;t have any issues, but the insides are zinc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this for amateurs who are new to wet shaves. It&#x27;s easy to use with just about any blade and is pretty forgiving of slips and mistakes. You might not get a deadly close shave around the neck, but that&#x27;s a small complaint for an otherwise bulletproof product.</li>
    <li> Good quality and hefty</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only way to truly shave.</li>
    <li> Works great! Love the closeness of the blade.  I will never go back to the store brand razor again. I use it to shave my face and head. I must warn you though, it will cut you if you get too impatient, so take your time until you get use to it.</li>
    <li> A great shave every time!  Love it!</li>
    <li> Shaves well, cleans well. Remember the blades you buy are very import. Be sure to buy high quality blades. Without them you will be&lt;br /&gt;disappointed. Also, the shaving soap is crucial. I love Porasso along with the shaving brush.</li>
    <li> A real solid piece of machinery! Call it old school or low tech, but this is the best shave one can get without using a cut throat straight blade! Coupled with Feather brand safety razor blades, this is the least expensive let alone the smoothest shave one can get, period! It&#x27;s sturdy enough to withstand any drop, will not rust, and is one of those sturdy, practical items that can be willed to another thruout generations should you wish.Perhaps I just got tired of the cheap plastic quadruple razors that cost an arm, leg and a testicle to keep me stubble free. Many men nowadays are going back to the old school safety razor and classic wet shave that true men of yesteryear (Teddy Rosevelt, John Wayne) used, and not only is it a more luxurious shave, but is also way more inexpensive and way more &amp;#34;greener&amp;#34; in terms of waste and the modern throw-away lifestyle we are accustomed to nowadays.</li>
    <li> works exactly as i wanted. easy to clean. easy to disassemble.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a long handle razor to see if it would be easier to use  I was right  This is a great razor. The long handle gives you much needed flexibility.</li>
    <li> This may be my most favorite thing I own.</li>
    <li> A precision instrument. Nothing feels like shaving with one of these.</li>
    <li> Feels sturdy in my hand and has nice weight. Finish is high quality, easy to clean. Although you shouldn&#x27;t over tighten the screw when reassembling, it feels strong enough it wouldn&#x27;t break if you accidentally torque it too much.</li>
    <li> I like my Merkur. I used it daily for several months before I got my Muhle R41. I LOVE and HATE the Muhle (it&#x27;s not near as forgiving as the Merkur). The Muhle is now my daily razor but if I had really sensitive skin and a beard that wasn&#x27;t like wire, I could pair the Merkur with a high quality blade like a Feather and get a good shave. I tried it with the Merkur blades an thought I was doing well until I got the Feather blades. What a difference. The Merkur is more affordable than the Muhle and it is a good entry level razor if you want to get into DE shaving.</li>
    <li> Use it often - hasn&#x27;t rusted yet and I&#x27;ve had it for 5 months or so.  I&#x27;ve saved A TON on razors and honestly this gives me a better shave than those fancy quadruple razors that cost far too much. BUY</li>
    <li> This is one of the best DE razors in my opinion. It doesn&#x27;t cut your face so long as you don&#x27;t press the razor hard straight into you skin. I have used several others with many different blades (feather, Gillette, Merkur, shark....the list goes on) and have found this one to be the most pleasurable and easy to use. It has a very nice angle and feels &amp;#34;quality weight&amp;#34; in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gets a very smooth shave. Not as smooth as a straight but that goes without saying. I would highly recommend this to novice and veteran DE&#x27;ers.</li>
    <li> If you get only one, get this one.  I have not had one nick but still close shaves.  I have used some other high dollar razors and nearly cut my head off.</li>
    <li> Wonderful razor that I hope to have for many years. I&#x27;m concerned about the reviews and pics I&#x27;m seeing where this razor&#x27;s head breaks off. (The screw that holds the assembly on rusts from the inside and breaks off.) I&#x27;m hoping that doesn&#x27;t happen because I&#x27;m getting the best shave in decades with this.</li>
    <li> I am new to DE shaving, so I took awhile to read razor reviews. This one, in my opinion, lives up to its positive reviews. It shaves wonderfully and I never want to return to over-priced and quick dulling Gillette blades! The razor is fairly heavy and you do not need to add additional pressure to get a close shave. The comb also prevents nicks; and I think a 30-degree angle is optimum. I&#x27;ve tried a couple of blade brands and I think Astra works better in this razor than the included Merkur blades.</li>
    <li> I have never owned a double edge razor before my purchase of the Merkur.&lt;br /&gt;A great razor and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a double edge razor!</li>
    <li> I love this safety razor. It has transformed how I shave. Solid design and comfortable handling make this a real weapon against facial hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not the type to write reviews but I felt compelled to say something about this great product.  After having used the expensive disposables for years and years (I&#x27;m 50) and watching the price of them skyrocket, enough was enough.  I decided to go old school but was unsure about using a single-bladed safety razor.  Boy am I glad I did!  This razor makes shaving something to look forward to and is a great money-saver as well.  As for shaving soap, I&#x27;m stuck with the same old pressurized can of gel as it does the best job for me, after having tried the brush.  My beard is of medium density, though.  Ymmv.  Enjoy.</li>
    <li> I switched to a Safety Razor because dealing with the prices of cartridges for Gillette Fusion was a pain in the neck.&lt;br /&gt;These accept any Double Edged Razors, and comes with one that lasted me about 5 shaves, and I found to be very smooth and easy to glide through thick beard hair.&lt;br /&gt;One of the things that impressed me the most was how effective these are. There is simply not Neck Irritation and once you shave with it, you&#x27;ll find out why many people make the switch.&lt;br /&gt;The Long Handle is perfect, due to the fact the normal handle is rather small.&lt;br /&gt;Made In Germany with amazing techniques and great steel.&lt;br /&gt;This ought to last a lifetime, and I&#x27;m glad, I wouldn&#x27;t want to shave with anything else.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend this product to anyone who does not like shaving, they&#x27;ll start to in no time with this timeless piece.</li>
    <li> Got this in making the switch from plastic, multi blade cartridge razors. This gives my just as close of a shave, the blades are cheap and the razor seems well made. I enjoy the weight of it in my hand, makes shaving easier to control!</li>
    <li> Ditch your other razor and get this! It is so much easier and it is such a better shave. The product feels sturdy and is easy to hold. Get the long handed one because the other might not be long enough at all.</li>
    <li> I just love my new razor.It is just perfect for a lady.My legs are nice and smooth.I haven&#x27;t had a shave this nice since I was a girl and used my Mom&#x27;s razor.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and this razor cuts way down on the burn! Simple design that gets the job done! Just be careful how you set the blade I notice if you set it to tight it can get a little out of line and cut you. ( no worse then the cheep safety razors but still better to avoid) Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> There is a reason why Merkur, Parker &amp; Edwin James razors are the standards by which every other razor is judged. The quality is good. The shave is good. The price is reasonable. After that, everything else is personal preference. This model is as good as it gets for first timers. It&#x27;s a three piece which makes it a little cheaper than Mekurs two piece. It comes with 1 blade &amp; while it&#x27;s acceptable, I personally think there are better blades available.</li>
    <li> Update - 6/24/15&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I liked the first one so much, that I bought a second one for travel.  I still highly recommend the product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*******************************************************************************************************************************************************************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been shaving since I was 14.  When I turned 18, I was given a Gillette Sensor by the manufacturer, and I was fairly pleased.  It certainly did a better job than the cheap disposables.  The cartridges were a little expensive, but at the time, affordable.  Several years later, the Mach 3 came out, and I sent in for a free trial.  I was able to get a very close shave with one pass, but the cost of the cartridges was high.  The prices kept going up, and after a little research, I decided to go with the DE approach.  Boy, am I glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor is very well made - shiny, solid stainless steel.  It has a nice heft to it and looks great.  All the research that I did made me thing that I&#x27;ll be having some rough shaves in the beginning - cuts, nicks and maybe not as smooth as I&#x27;d like.  Well, my first shave was a little rough, as I completely avoided any pressure what-so-ever, and only went with the grain.  After 3 passes, the beard was gone and no cuts (but it was a tad rough...)  After that, I decided to experiment with various pressure and going cross-grain.  I get extremely smooth shaves and no cuts or nicks.  I&#x27;m still trying out various razors, but ultimately, I haven&#x27;t found a blade that won&#x27;t give at least a satisfactory shave.  For what it&#x27;s worth, this came with a Merkur blade, and it works just fine!  They just cost a little more than some others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the advantages this razor has over cartridge-based razors is that there is a cavernous space between the blade and the holder.  You can make several passes without having to rinse, even with a few days growth.  With my Mach 3, I needed to rinse every one or two passes, or else it&#x27;d get clogged (and sometimes rinsing didn&#x27;t help, either!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, I highly recommend this.  The learning curve is much smaller than I had expected.  The quality is outstanding (it really does feel like it&#x27;ll last a few lifetimes!) Once the initial investment is done, your expenses and amount of waste will be GREATLY reduced.lse it&#x27;d get clogged (and sometimes rinsing didn&#x27;t help, either!)

    <li> Not good. I shaved with this razor quite a few times seeing if it would deliver a better shave than a modern razor. It did not. My face was never as smooth as when I shave with a modern razor. I even bought different types of shaving cream and everything. Its harder to use, and doesn&#x27;t work as well. I would recommend this to no one.</li>
    <li> I have never had a closer shave!  Merkur&#x27;s razor provides a comfortable, close shave for a fraction of the lifetime price! I bought this with Personna razors and the combination is amazing. It looks great sitting on my bathroom shelf next to my great grandfathers shaving mug. I do like the longer handle more than a normal sized one. The balance point for me is better, but be careful if you want a traveling case for it, make sure it will fit a long handle razor!</li>
    <li> Works as described.  Excellent quality and prompt delivery thanks to Prime!</li>
    <li> 3 parts of solid metal, simple design, works great, one of the best products I own. I am sure this thing will last longer than humankind.</li>
    <li> I decided to give the Wet Double Edge Razor Method of Shaving a try because I was tired of spending close to four dollars a piece for disposable cartridges. I&#x27;m 46 and I have tried lots of different cartridge type razors, electric razors, shaving creams etc over the years. I am very prone to getting razor burn and ingrown hairs so this will be a test. I&#x27;ve ordered a variety pack of razor blades to test out with this razor to see which works best for me. The Merkur 180 fits well in the hand. I have average size hands. I used the Merkur blade that came with the Razor came with and I will have to say I was a little disappointed in the results. I tried the Van Der Hagen Premium Soap, three different in the can shaving creams. The result was razor burn and ingrown hairs on my neck. This is not the fault of the razor as it appears to be very well built, but the blade did not agree with me. I tried the Wilkinson blade and it did not seem to be as an aggressive blade. My advice if this is your first time using a double edge razor order a variety pack of blades to see what works for you and there are lots of websites and videos showing techniques for Wet Shaving with a Double Edge Razor. Proper Angle, Preparing your face etc. The Merkur 180 is a fine piece of German engineering. You&#x27;ve just got to get the right blade.</li>
    <li> First time DE shaver and looked for a while before purchasing. From a fellow worker who DE shaves, he recommended a Merkur since they are generally a good quality product and easy to use. Love the chrome and it is easy to clean up, i just take apart and wash in hot water with a nail brush then dry everything good before I put back together. Good heft on head, that is good since you want to use the weight of the shaver and not apply pressure like you do with cartridge razors. I use the Parazo soap and badger tail hair brush to make a good lather and apply, I do this right after getting out of the shower and love the feeling of applying the lather. After a few days I can say that my skin feels so much better than using can gel/cream! I hold my razor by the end of the handle, find a good cutting angle and start shaving. Shaving this way make take a little more time but it is definitely worth it! My girlfriend complimented on my very first shave how smooth it was and could also tell a difference in my skin after a day or two. I can actually say I look forward to shaving each day! Just take your time, get the right soap and brush and learn. I also purchased a sample pack of several razors that I will be using to determine my future blade!    (UPDATE 31 JAN 15) Been using a week and can say I will definitely never go back to cartridges!!! I can tell a massive improvement in my skin, it feels so much healthier than using can foam and a cartridge. I actually look forward to shaving everyday, kinda my me time!! The Merkur blade was about a 3-4 Star but the Feather blade is a definite 5 Star blade for me!! Using the same soap and brush as above and am nothing less than amazed how great my face feels!!! Have I mentioned how great the skin on my face feels??!! Using Grey Flannel aftershave to top off the finish. My girlfriend is in love with my shave and my aftershave!!! I am sure I will have other Safety Razors later but at least this is a great starting razor!! I always makesure to take apart and clean, dry, and reassemble for the next day. Wish I had known to use a safety razor years ago!! Don&#x27;t wait, ditch the plastic schoolboy razor and step up to a mans razor! You, your face and significant other deserves it!!!!!</li>
    <li> I switched to wet shaving about a month ago and picked up this razor. I&#x27;ve been very happy with it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-good amount of weight so you don&#x27;t have to apply pressure to cut through the hair.&lt;br /&gt;-comfortable grip.&lt;br /&gt;-easy to change blades.</li>
    <li> Was expecting the twist type handles of the old school.  Little difficult putting in blades and cleaning them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wet shaving now for about 2 months, and started off with an inexpensive Van Der Hagen razor, to  good effect.  I was finally able to visit an Art of Shaving Store as I was ready to upgrade my razor, but was scared off by the high prices for thier Merkur Razors.  This one looked reasonable priced, so I decided to give it try.  All I can say is that Merkur totally lives up to the reputation.  Smooth shave, and forgiving for a newbie like me.  If you started out with one of the lower end brand razors to get your feet wet, this is definately your next step in the razor ladder.</li>
    <li> After only a few shaves, the metal has some rust.</li>
    <li> i was tired of constantly buying razor and kept hearing good things about this product and decided to get it, there is a small learning curve on how to use it but you will get it fast. In all, this is one fine piece of equipment i get a clean shave and no longer get irritation, a definite buy</li>
    <li> I am a woman and really wanted an environmentally friendly and good quality razor. This seemed like the best, but I wasn&#x27;t sure whether this razor would work for female shaving. Reading a review of another woman saying that it worked very well gave me confidence, so I got it. I&#x27;ve now used it for three months and I could not be happier! This razor is so good! I was afraid it would cut me, since it&#x27;s so sharp, but its safety protects from any cuts possible. I have had a great success shaving everywhere I need...no problem! The quality of the enclosed razor blade is superb; with reusable razors I had to shave every day, but with this one only every other third day. The razor blade also doesn&#x27;t lose sharpness even after a month of use. I would highly recommend it to all my friends.</li>
    <li> This is an exceptional razor for a close, smooth shave.  I bought this for my son&#x27;s 18th birthday, in celebration of manhood.  He loves this and has used it for over a year now.  It has a small learning curve, but he has the knack of it in no time and would never go back to disposable razors again.  With the addition of a badger brush and a gourmet shaving book it was a perfect gift.  It is well made, sturdy, the long handle is perfect for him (6&#x27;4&amp;#34;) and his larger hands.  The components are simple and have shown no signs of wear, even with a novice at the helm for the last 14 months, I expect this well made razor to last decades.</li>
    <li> Works great, good price.</li>
    <li> I never knew how great a shave could be until I started using a safety razor. I never used a safety razor before but since picking up this baby I have great smooth saves, no more ingrown hairs, and my skin looks and feels a lot better. I can&#x27;t compare this razor to others since this is my first and only safety razor but right off the bat I can tell you this is a million times better than any multi-blade razor out there. If you are looking to buy your first safety razor this is not a bad choice to go with.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 20 years old and I love my double edge safety razor. I can&#x27;t believe I have shaved without it during the past 6-7 years. With a single blade double edge safety razor, you will get an amazing shave (better than the cool razors on tv) and you will save a lot of money over the course of a year and your lifetime!</li>
    <li> I got this gift as a Christmas present for one of my friends &amp; he loved it so much all of his roommates ordered one.</li>
    <li> Best razor I have ever had. Would recommend to anyone! Design is very easy to shave with. Make sure you order blades with it.</li>
    <li> I love this safety razor.  This is also my first time using one and I&#x27;m glad I have this.  Before I would use disposable razors and from there I moved to the gillette fusion.  I admit the fusion was better, but the cost not was not so great.  Also one thing I had in common with those two types is I would I always get irritated skin.  After I started using this Merkur the irritation has completely vanished and I get a close shave.  At first I was bit worry of cutting myself using this safety razor, but after about a week started getting used to it.  So overall I would definitely recommend this Merkur 180.</li>
    <li> How did the modern razor ever replace this? I fell victim to my generation&#x27;s Mach 3 razor blade style, and never got to experience this. I am now 33. I&#x27;m glad I found this before I died. The traditional modern day shaving system is a rip off and will leave you nothing but burned...literally razor burn. I can replace the blade every time I shave with this, like a king and a boss, and not even flinch. not that you would have to, but why not. If I could summarize this product design in one word I would, but you can&#x27;t. So I&#x27;ll choose a phrase. Like a boss.</li>
    <li> First of all, it&#x27;s a beautiful, heavyweight razor.  I had no problem switching to it or figuring it out after switching from a disposable.  But the shave was nothing better than my Gillette Custom Plus 3 disposable gave me.  In fact, it wasn&#x27;t as good.  I still have it, but never use it.  Maybe some day.</li>
    <li> When I read about the &amp;#34;learning curve&amp;#34; with this type of razor, I expected to have to spend a lot of time figuring out how to use it without cutting myself, but it&#x27;s really not hard.  You just take it slow, and pay attention to what you&#x27;re doing, and sure it takes 30 seconds longer but in 2 months this thing easily paid for itself just because I don&#x27;t have to spend 15 bucks or more on cartridges. A cheap blade comes out to about 20 cents per blade at the dollar store, lasts just as long as the &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; cartridges, and still gets a closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I said it takes 30 seconds longer, but really, if I wanted a shave like this from any of my old razors, I had to shave twice or even 3 times, so technically, it&#x27;s faster for me and my thick hair.</li>
    <li> Double edge razors can be very mild, or very aggressive, depending on how close the guards allow the blade to get to your skin. This is a good, affordable model if you&#x27;re starting out with DE wet shaving because it&#x27;s on the milder side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s well made, weighty, easy to clean, and looks nice. Once you get to the point where you can shave with this razor with no irritation at all, move on to something a little more aggressive. If I were going to start a young man out on DE shaving, I would give him this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure go to the forums like badger&amp;blade to get a good idea of how different model razors perform.</li>
    <li> Good razor, large enough.</li>
    <li> I honestly can&#x27;t get as close to my face like I can with the Mach-3 razors.  I use I use this because I figured it would get as close or closer for less money in the long haul.  I still have to use disposable razors every now and then.</li>
    <li> this was a great idea to buy, it works fantastic, it&#x27;s easy to use, will last forever, no more buying throw away or buying 25.00 replacement blades. it looks great sitting in the stand with the brush, almost makes the bathroom look classy. Here is the best part my two boys seem to have more respect for it than the other throw away razors go figure it&#x27;s always back in the stand not all over the bathroom or in what shelf in the cabinet. Buy this once and be set for life.</li>
    <li> The Merkur 180 is my first safety razor. I have been using it for 6 months now and I am very happy with it. This is the only safety razor model I have used, so I am not able to compare to other safety razors. I have used cartridge razors like the Gillette Mach 3 and electric razors, both foil and rotary. The Merkur provides a much closer and more comfortable shave than any electric razor I have ever used. With electric razors, I would end up irritating my skin trying to go over areas that it missed on the first pass. While a cartridge razor can provide a close shave and make it easier to not nick yourself, the price of the cartridges is ridiculous. There was a little bit of adjustment when getting used to shaving with the Merkur, but now I like it better than any other razor I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blades:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried two different blade types: Bic and Feather. I got the Bic blades as my starter blades and they worked well with the Merkur. However, the Bic blades seemed to be a little too dull for me at times, so I tried upgrading to the Feather blades. The Feather blades are great. They are really sharp and I get a nice smooth shave with them. The Feather blades also last much longer than the Bic blades did for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this razor and highly recommend using the Feather blades with it (but maybe not if you are just starting with a safety razor).</li>
    <li> I loved my Merkur safety razor, I purchased it to save money. It only lasted 19 months. I would have expected something like this to last much longer than a year and a half. I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
    <li> After reading all the review on amazon and other websites about this razor I decided to purchase it. I am very happy that I did. It works very good. I actually now look forward to shaving.</li>
    <li> The Merkur Model 180 razor shaves my face as smooth as they come.  I loved it and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Handles comfortably and is not too heavy.</li>
    <li> I had been contemplating the use of a double-edge safety razor for quite some time. I wanted a more economical and &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; option for shaving beyond disposable razors or hefty (and expensive) replacement blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am currently using Derby blades (note that if you don&#x27;t order blades immediately this product does come with one blade), and I have been able to quickly conform to the use of this razor for legs, underarms and &amp;#34;intimate areas&amp;#34;. I have experienced no ingrown hairs, as well, which has been a major bonus. Surprisingly, it took the most experience to relearn how to shave underarms, and I have impressed myself with my ease of use of this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a blade is fresh, I might get one or two small nicks, however I have found these cuts to be so small that I have not noticed them the next day after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you are hesitant about buying this razor for leg/underarm/etc. shaving, I would suggest to go ahead and try this &amp;#34;old style&amp;#34; of shaving!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
    <li> I love my razor.  I get a closer shave than I have ever gotten with any other razor. I have a thick beard so multiple blade razors always clogged up on me. This I never have a problem with. I do need to slow down on the process a little or I will cut myself. As long as I take my time it&#x27;s not a problem though.  I do suggest using a good shave soap and brush instead of cheap shave cream though. Added bonus I bought 100 blades for $15 and get 3 shaves per blade. 300 close shaves for $15. How&#x27;s that compare to the razor you use now?</li>
    <li> that is what I learned to shave with  love it.</li>
    <li> Nice razor. New DE shaver here coming straight from the Mach 3 which is the only thing I&#x27;ve ever shaved with before for the previous 15 years. Holds the blade firm without loosening and the long handle makes it easy to grip like the new razors I grew up with. Cheap. Your decision to buy this should be easy as pie.</li>
    <li> As good or better shave than I get from one of the multiblade razors. Gets clogged far less and a quick rinse under the tap and its ready to go again. I think it&#x27;ll be a lot cheaper over time as well</li>
    <li> After a few years of consideration, I finally made the move and bought this razor.  After only a few shaves, I am only unhappy that I waited this long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my research, I read countless reviews on these DE razors; the sum of which point to satisfied users.  The main reason I waited so long to buy was because I had myself convinced I needed one of the higher dollar units.  Speaking from a new user of only this particular model, I am thus far highly satisfied.  To be fair, I have never experienced the $150 [and up] models.  As of now, I&#x27;m seeing no defendable reason to spend tons of money on a fancier unit that probably doesn&#x27;t hold the blade in any quantifiably different fashion than this affordable razor.  After all, isn&#x27;t it the blade that does the lion&#x27;s share of the work in this operation?  I could be wrong...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now getting shave results like I have never received before.  I have never been happy with my electric razor.  A note here as well as I have experience with only one from many years ago.  It is however, a modern Norelco unit.  But I see it as foolish to buy multiple different electric razors [all at or above $100] to find the best performer.  For my money, a real wet shave is the ONLY way.  Therefore, I&#x27;ve stuck by disposable razors for many years.  Getting tied of the pricey Mach 3 and the like I have been using store brand of the multi-bladed variety, with nearly imperceptible difference from the name brand Mach 3&#x27;s I might add.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But no matter how hard or many times I scraped my face, still the closeness had eluded me.  I was a bit nervous the first time I approached my face with this more exposed blade, but was quickly relieved to find that I had little to fear.  I say little, as my Father suggests [and I see as most likely in my future on some groggy morning] that cutting or even more severely slicing my face is very much in play with these older-school razors.  Time will tell, but for now I am very happy with the results I&#x27;m getting.  Even the little red bumps and irritation on my lower cheek/chin are disappearing.  One other thing with regard to skin irritations, I have found tea tree oil after shaving to be a grand help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My next area of attention will be with trying different blade manufacturers.  The blade that comes with this unit is all I have used just yet.  I will move on to the box of Merkur blades I purchased long with this razor.  I&#x27;ll be looking for no perceptible difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go forth and return to doing things the old way.  You&#x27;ll be happy you did.</li>
    <li> I have two razors and this one is my go to razor. Very comfortable to shave with. Good quality too.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how this razor shaves so good and close but I am impressed!&lt;br /&gt;My face is smooth! Closet shave ever!</li>
    <li> this is a heavy, sturdy and quality product, much better to use and cheaper than modern blades and disposables. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> I wanted to try out shaving with a DE razor. I have sensitive skin and every time I shave with a disposable razor or a mach razor I get ingrown hairs on my neck. This helped with the razor burn/ingrown hairs and feels great when shaving. It did take a week to get use to, had to learn not to push down like other razors.</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband and he says he&#x27;ll never go back to disposables. Easy to use, gentle on his skin, and a close shave. Feels well made, too.</li>
    <li> brand new to safety razor shaving and I&#x27;m very glad I made the switch. avoid the Gillette monopoly at your department store and invest in this. shaving feels so much more refreshing now and it doesn&#x27;t feel like a chore.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend has delicate skin and we were looking for a solution to ease shaving, as well as the pain in our pocket. This razor takes some getting used to, but once your do, is excellent at what it does. Looking at buying more as gifts.</li>
    <li> get it if you dislike expensive use and throw blades.&lt;br /&gt;get it if you like to save some money annually on shaving blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I  purchased it for some 35 $ and got 100 astra DE blades for 10 $ and i am amazed by the shaving results i am getting, I think this a good alternative to  use and throw Gillette mach 3, which i was using prior to this, and for lesser money&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;note: Be careful to use it initially, shave slow and easy without putting pressure on razor against your face, just glide it with appropriate feel over your beard and in due time you will get used to the weight and feel of the merkur razor.</li>
    <li> New convert to Merkur! No more disposable razors. I got a long, no guard. I use it with Feather blades and Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Shaving Gel. The result is the closest, most comfortable shave outside of a barber shop. Never goin&#x27; back to Bic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give the Merkur 4 instead of 5 stars. I hoped that you could change blades without having to remove the blade head. I minor inconvenience, but an inconvenience nontheless. The quality of this product certainly makes up for this small shortcoming.</li>
    <li> One is the product states long handled. I can tell you its not. Second the Merkur blade that came with it was not sharp. Really had hoped to go back to a single bladed razor like this. Not impressed with the shave out of this unit.</li>
    <li> My first safety razor, and it will take a little getting used to. Provides a very close shave, but you have to learn how to hold the razor blade with respect to the skin. I&#x27;ll be using a safety razor going forward forever. Never a disposable....</li>
    <li> Put simply, this is a simple man&#x27;s razor, like the one your grandpa used. Need to get used to it if you&#x27;re used to those multi-blade shavers, but once you do you notice the difference. The main reason I bought this is because the blades are cheaper, but one I got it I noticed if you shave nice and slow you actually get a closer shave than the multi-blade ones and the blades last a lot longer. A worthwhile investment if you ask me!</li>
    <li> I first bought an Edwin Jagger.  I used that for a month, trying several different blades (Feather, Derby, Merkur, 7 o&#x27;clock, Wilson Sword).  It worked well only with a Feather blade but still either cut me or irritated my skin every shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then bought this Merkur and noticed a dramatic difference immediately.  This razor gives me a comfortable shave.  I do have to make multiple passes in several directions (with the grain, across it, against it) to get that shave but I get there.  I almost never cut myself with this razor.  It is much more forgiving of blades; I haven&#x27;t decided which works best, only that the Wilson was not acceptable.  Even the Derby works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One drawback is that the two parts of the razor that hold the blade do not fit tightly together, as the alignment pins and the mating holes have a significant amount of slack; the fit is much tighter on the EJ.  Consequently, when you install a new blade, you have to make sure that the blade is positioned straight and with the same amount of edge exposed on both sides of the razor before tightening the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are new to safety razors, you also probably know by now that it is traditional to use shaving soap instead of shaving cream or gel.  I tried the soap, watching YouTube videos to learn how to create a lather.  I was able to make a lather but found that it just didn&#x27;t give me a good shave.  I experimented with shaving gel and shaving cream.  I have ditched the shaving soap and brush for Barbasol shaving cream, which is quick, effective, and relatively inexpensive.</li>
    <li> My husband loves the look, the feel, and the shave. It&#x27;s chrome-like finish is very attractive to a man and he said he got a great shave out of it.</li>
    <li> decided to go with the merkur 180 after waiting and waiting for a similar razor to get in stock....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;glad i did, good weight and a close shave. have hardly cut myself and this is my first Safety Razor...</li>
    <li> I definitely recommend the long handle model. It feels solid in your hand and shaves extremely well. I&#x27;m using the Feather razor blades, which seem almost paper thin.</li>
    <li> Best shaving razor that I&#x27;ve used. I like the large handle and the ease of handling during my daily shave.</li>
    <li> Nice and heavy. The razor does the work with no hand pressure. This is a winner. Once you shave with a safety razor, you won&#x27;t go back to some plastic thing - no matter how many (miniature, clogging) blades they put in it.</li>
    <li> this thing changed my life!!!  Get it along with some great shaving oil and some feather blades!</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Solid - seems like it is so well build that it will be around forever.&lt;br /&gt;Economical - after the initial investment in the razor your costs go down considerably since replacement blades for a double edge safety razor are a fraction of the price of say Mach 3 blades.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean - since it unscrews into 3 pieces you are able to keep the whole set up clean and dry after each use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Difficult to shave head - I have been shaving my head for almost 10 years with the Mach 3 razor and have nicked myself only a handful of times. With this razor (which I used for an entire month) I would cut myself at least 5 or 6 times each time I shaved my head! The angle at which the blade must be kept in relation to the skin that is being shaved has to be perfect. Angle it too wide and the blade misses the hair all together, and too shallow and you&#x27;ll take a chunk out of your head! Shaving the face and neck with this razor was actually very pleasant since you are able to maintain the proper angle realitively easily. However, transitioning from the front of ones head to the back with this razor I found to be more trouble than its worth.</li>
    <li> Shaves great, nice feel, good balance, nice looking, perhaps best suited for one with larger hands.</li>
    <li> The number of positive reviews and claims of the incredible shave that this razor provides (with use of proper blade) sold me instantly. I love the masculine appeal, the whole old-fashioned barber shop thing, and the shaving enthusiasts who claim the sharpest DE blades equal a better shave, but to me the results aren&#x27;t worth the extra effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this razor for a total of four months, with four different blades, and I can not understand why it is so popular. If you use the proper pre-shaving oils, shower beforehand, take three passes, then follow up with a alum stick and moisturizer, you get a shave that&#x27;s equal to the multi-blade technology. The worst part is this takes so much time compared to modern shaving that it&#x27;s impractical for the average guy who shaves in the morning before work. Even with a new blade, I often would get irritated skin and cuts on my neck, after practicing the art of the shaving angle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently tried a promotional multi-blade razor I received and used it one morning running late for work. I was shocked that I actually got a better shave blind, in the shower, with a can of foam than I did buying these overpriced soaps, oils, brushes, blades, and razors. Although over time you may end up saving money, the initial investment up front has made this experience for me a disappointment. I will probably be able to sell my razor from the amount of rave reviews, but I am let down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I disagree with those who claim the gimmicks of the shaving industry by adding more blades makes the \\&quot;gullible masses\\&quot; out there believe it&#x27;s better. The market forced the DE razors to go extinct, and discarded them along with vinyl records. This is obsolete technology, AND you can&#x27;t take it on airplanes.</li>
    <li> I bought this bad boy two years ago and it&#x27;s still going strong.  No damage, tarnish, rust, etc.  Very sturdy and heavy--feels like a quality product.  Handle is easy to hang onto and never slips.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Wish I would have tried a DE 20 years ago. This one is excellent. First shave with proraso shaving cream was the best shave of my life. My wife couldn&#x27;t agree more, BBS!</li>
    <li> My first razor of this type. I did some research as to how to shave with a double edge safety razor before using on Youtube and in blogs etc. Taking that info and taking my time I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If first time for this type of razor start with it on a day off so you don&#x27;t have to rush.</li>
    <li> Took a month to learn how to use, but it&#x27;s been great ever since</li>
    <li> Built to last, and holds the blade rock solid, the edge at the perfect angle, all the way across the blade. Not much to go wrong with this design. Wish I wouldn&#x27;t have let my boyhood attraction to the twist open wing style to sway me. It had several issues, although basically worked. This Merkur is the cat&#x27;s whiskers, though--no pun intended. I would recommend anyone on the fence to go this way.</li>
    <li> Been using this razor since Christmas, and I really like it. It really rekindled the novelty of shaving for me, and I get a great close shave without the burn.</li>
    <li> I love the feeling of a nice/clean/close shave, and this model absolutely delivers. The weight balance is even. Safety features are fully functional, unless you&#x27;re a little clumsy or have a slight hand shake from to much drinking the night before. Takes a little more care when getting close on the curves and close trim but this is so much worth the money to buy this razor than purchase 10 replacement blades for a buck other than get 4 replacements for a Gillette for $14 at wal mart. And you will obviously recognize the quality as soon as you open the box, install the blade, and hold it in your hand. Like I said, it takes a little more time for the close trim areas, but i am kind of a geek so i did a time study between this model and my Gillette Mach 4. It took me about 1min 30sec. longer to pay attention to the close shave areas.</li>
    <li> This is a lovely razor and works very well. However, after about 6 months of use, I dropped it in the shower and it broke. (A screw that was melded to the top of the razor detached.) It is now unusable. I expected better durability for a razor like this.</li>
    <li> hubby loves his new razor.  shaves great</li>
    <li> This was my first DE razor, so I can&#x27;t compare it to anything but cartridges. A little strange to learn at first but does a much better job imo. DE shaving makes shaving fun, and this is a solid, well-made razor to start off with. It will last you a long time.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful razor and the boyfriend absolutely loves it.  It&#x27;s very shiny and sleek and does the job better than any regular store-bought razor.</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t see these any more but this one is nice.  Now I just have to learn to use it with my other non-dominant hand.</li>
    <li> After all these years, finally using the safety razor full time without ever turning back. Forget the Mach 10000, the super twenty blade rocket powered razor, the wet dry electric skin ripping worst shave ever styles! Save your skin and your money and shave like a man again!</li>
    <li> This is my first ever DE safety razor. My father always used a Gillette Mach 2 cartridge razor and passed that onto me. The Gillette Mach 2 razors irritated my skin and overall left me with a dissatisfying shave due to the discomfort of the blades. With the help of a few educational videos, I learned my way around safety razors and shaved with the Merkur for the first time this morning. Being overly cautious since it was my first shave, it took me about 15 minutes. I also used Barbasol Sensitive Skin shaving cream that I got from my local pharmacy (I&#x27;ll attempt to make the switch to using a mug, brush, and paste later on) and Astra Superior Platinum blades that I also bought here on Amazon. With 2 passes, my skin was baby smooth with absolutely no stubble or irritation. The Merkur not only delivers a quality shave, but feels solidly constructed in your hand. The etchings on the handle make for a perfect grip. The weight adds to the feeling of security and stability. Aesthetically, it&#x27;s a work of art. I&#x27;d make the same purchase again and again. It saves money in the long run and more than satisfied shavers everywhere.</li>
