<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a wonder lotion for me. I have VERY dry hands from handling &amp; delivering mail. I work in the elements and because the mail is SO dirty, I&#x27;m  constantly washing my hands...which drys them out. I use this mostly at night before bed (sometimes a extra use if REALLY dry during the day) and this lotion repairs cracked skins practically overnight! (deeper cracks take a application a couple nights in a row with daytime application in between. I HIGHLY recommend this lotion!</li>
    <li> not water proof, for jobs where you need to wash hands or are in contact with water, it clears it off, but good lotion</li>
    <li> This lotion is great. Very smooth, somewhat thick but absorbs fast. I really like it.</li>
    <li> This is undoubtedly the best cream I&#x27;ve ever encountered.  I&#x27;ll continue using it!</li>
    <li> Really thick, great lotion and really stays on and isn&#x27;t watery</li>
    <li> A satisfactory purchase, looking forward to the next</li>
    <li> Finally I found this perfect lotion for my skin! Love it!</li>
    <li> Works well, but the moisturizing sensation doesn&#x27;t last over a few hours before I have to reapply. But for the price, it&#x27;s a steal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no fragrance and it is a great size to keep in your car or purse. No greasiness whatsoever.</li>
    <li> The best hand cream I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> Best hand cr&amp;egrave;me I&#x27;ve ever used. Leaves hands soft and moisturized but not greasy. I apply after every hand-washing and can go right back to working on the computer or my phone. LOVE this stuff. I bought 10 of these for teacher gifts, bus driver gifts, friends and co-workers. They all love it!</li>
    <li> What I like best about this product is that it goes in very quickly.  Sometimes we just don&#x27;t want to sit around for several minutes and wait for hand cream to absorb.  That&#x27;s when I reach for the Eucerin Intensive Repair -- when I need to moisurize and go. (I also keep the heavier creams on hand, for when I&#x27;ve got plenty of time to massage it in.)  But Eucerin is so handy, I&#x27;m sure I moisturize more when I have it.  It&#x27;s a good product from a brand I trust.</li>
    <li> Tiny container for the price.</li>
    <li> Seems to work very well.  I have had no cracking fingers during this brutal winter, so I am quite pleased.</li>
    <li> It is a good product , has been using it to moisturize my hands</li>
    <li> Love it and not greasy - no residue left on my hands.  Works well for excessive dryness during cold weather.  This is my second bottle.</li>
    <li> Love the Eucerin brand! These lotion is particular is a little thick, but definately provides the moisture I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion. It really hydrates your skin and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and leaves your skin silky soft.</li>
    <li> I am a heavy user of this product, and it works really good for my extra dry hands. I do much cooking, I wash my hands very often and have to use alcohol-based cleansers much, and it&#x27;s cold where I live. A bad dream for any skin. Yet this little thing does the job perfectly. I used to apply Dry Skin Therapy calming creme by Eucerin, and it helped too, but it was taking too much time to soak and dry completely. This one acts much quicker.&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is packaging: when you already can&#x27;t squeeze any more from it, there&#x27;s like a quarter more still inside. The creme is quite thick, and it just sticks to the tube. So when I finish a pack from my purse, I leave it at home, cut the top off, and can still use the rest by reaching inside. Yet this is not too good for a product, because you have to either throw out a tube with a lot still inside, or risk opening the contents to air and bacteria.</li>
    <li> I keep it on the desk top for easy use!</li>
    <li> not adsorbed completely</li>
    <li> This is great hand cream. It is not greasy and is fragrance  free.</li>
    <li> I wash my hands so many times a day at work, but this instantly hydrates them without making them greasy.</li>
    <li> Wife loves this product. Helps us both with dry hands during the New England winters</li>
    <li> I felt too oily after applying it to my hand. Compared with EOS brand, I like eos better.</li>
    <li> Well it is highly cost effective. I like it.</li>
    <li> I feel the picture for the product is misleading.  You get the impression you are ordering 3 tubes of hand cream.  Be aware, you only receive one.&lt;br /&gt;Image for this product should be revised.</li>
    <li> I will agree with another reviewer who says that this is at best, a misleading listing for this product. I am almost certain that when I ordered, it stated that this was for a 3 pack of this item. Alas, I didn&#x27;t bother to take a screenshot of the page when I ordered so I have no proof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The picture for this item should be changed to only one item and not three.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only tried it twice, but it is very thick (as a hand cream should be, based on my experience) and it makes my hands velvety smooth. I would recommend this for someone with dry, cracked hands.</li>
    <li> Stays on a long time to protect my hands. Only need a small amount.</li>
    <li> Arrived in sealed plastic bags, no leaks. Excellent price, good quality!</li>
    <li> Great cream for sensitive skins during the winter.&lt;br /&gt;Leave your skins dry; which is great when you need to type on computers.</li>
    <li> I swear, I have tried at least a dozen different \\&quot;intensive\\&quot; hand lotions, but most of them I write off for smelling weird (like babies or weird floral/candy combos, ie [[ASIN:B000S01TBG The Naked Bee Naked Bee Hand &amp; Body Lotion 6.7 oz lotion - Orange Blossom Honey]]), being greasy, or just not working at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product, on the other hand (get it, HAND?) doesn&#x27;t really smell at all and works a charm on my dry knuckles (too much bicycling in cold weather/hand washing) and split fingertips (stupid paperwork filing).  The bottle seems small but you don&#x27;t really need a lot for each application.  I&#x27;m stashing one on my nightstand and in my desk at work.  Goodbye, gross winter skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sidenote: this product does contain some parabens ingredients, if you are against that sort of thing.  I forget why I am supposed to be up in arms (Ha!  Hands and Arms!) about that, but I am ok with taking that risk....</li>
    <li> Greasy , works just like every other generic hand cream. maybe even greasier .</li>
    <li> Really good, and isn&#x27;t greasy at all.  I have stopped buying my expensive hand creme as this does the trick for about 1/4 the price.</li>
    <li> I work in the medical field, so my hands are always getting dried out from washing them and I&#x27;m always on the hunt for the next best lotion. I&#x27;m really happy that I tried this; it&#x27;s the perfect size to keep on my desk and it soaks in quickly after applying it. It leaves my hands feeling silky soft and it has a very mild pleasant smell to it. I will definitely be buying a larger quantity next time!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is the most moisturizing, but it is magic for how it makes my hands look!  I don&#x27;t have the prettiest hands and when i put this on I think they look their best.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I use it every day.</li>
    <li> too strong an odor and does no better than the original lotion.  The creme works better than the lotions for really bad cracking fingers but the lotions are good for lighter use.  Still prefer the original because I can&#x27;t tolerate the smell of this.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion we ever have. Our family is a big fan of Eucerin products.</li>
    <li> I researched hand creams and this one was one of the best rated. After using it for a month I agree.</li>
    <li> My favorite hand cream. Very soft</li>
    <li> Perfect size for purse.  I can&#x27;t be without my Intensive Repair and will never waste money on other brands again.  I&#x27;ve found the Holy Grail.</li>
    <li> Great product with a great price.  Battles the cold weather in NY near the Canadian Border.  All should buy this.</li>
    <li> feels just like a regular lotion</li>
    <li> Love this hand cream!!</li>
    <li> very nice hand cream--on subscribe &amp; save for this.</li>
    <li> My hands were incredibly dry from the winter.  This is the first Winter that my skin has ever been dry. My hands were red and hurt so badly.  I put a COUPLE layers of this hand cream on before bedtime and by morning they were much improved!  After just 2 days my hands were completely better and now I don&#x27;t even need to use this product everyday.  The cream is even water resistant.</li>
    <li> Love this product, does wonders for dry skin</li>
    <li> I keep this on a table and use it while watching TV in the evening. Leaves my hands very smooth.</li>
    <li> This lotion is wonderful in the winter when everything is SO dry. It is not a very thick lotion so it doesn&#x27;t leave your hands sticky or unusable, it spreads quickly and absorbs right away. Love the size, fits in my purse perfectly. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Keeps hands soft and comfortable</li>
    <li> Feels good.not greasy better than most lotions...for the price.</li>
    <li> chalky hands no more. leaves no oily residue but a wet/dry feel that is hard to explain but works immediately. after a few days, like a babys behind.</li>
    <li> i have extremely dry, cracked hands from washing them frequently&lt;br /&gt;this did not work as well as I expected</li>
    <li> it made my hands feeling really cool and no sweaty palms!</li>
    <li> Perfect moisturiser especially for  hands.I Like it very much and helps me relieves my dry hands.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a new hand cream/lotion to use at work, now that the winter months are coming. I&#x27;ve been pretty happy with the Nivea one that has macadamia nut oil, but it was not in stock where I was shopping. Many of the hand creams contained petroleum jelly (i.e., Vaseline), but I was looking for something a little lighter and not quite as greasy, so I settled for this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a relatively effective product in terms of the condition of my hands after using it. It does soothe and soften dry skin. It&#x27;s not non-greasy, but there are a few things you can do to reduce the grease level. First, use it sparingly -- a little goes a long way. Second, rub it in for a little longer than you otherwise might. Even though there is a bit of a greasy feel after using this, it does not get all over my keyboard like other lotions I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had one complaint, it&#x27;s regarding the warnings on the back of this product. Because this contains lactic acid (an alpha-hydoxy acid), you are advised to wear (1) sunscreen and (2) protective clothing. Keep in mind, of course, that this is a hand lotion. Wearing sunscreen would mean finding an additional hand lotion, and who is going to want to use two hand lotions simultaneously? And the only protective clothing for hands that I know of consists of gloves or mittens. If you&#x27;re being sensible, I suppose you could wear gloves outside (which you should do anyway during the winter) and not worry about things indoors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI, the purpose of the lactic acid is to help get rid of dead skin cells, which WILL assist in smoothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients (since they&#x27;re not always obvious in Amazon product descriptions): Water, Glycerin, Urea, Glyceryl Stearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Dicaprylyl Ether, Sodium Lactate, Dimethicone, PEG 40 Stearate, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclohexasiloxane, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Lactic Acid, Xanthan Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben</li>
    <li> The Eucerin line of skin care products, with the exception of their Q10 Anti-Wrinkle cream, does not work as well for me as another manufacturer&#x27;s.  This product does not soak into the skin, but rather, sits of top and is viscous and sticky.</li>
    <li> first time i bought for her, she loves it.. couple of her friends also asked about the product from where to get this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m goona order again soon</li>
    <li> In the winter, my hands tend to get extremely dry and cracked.  Until this year, I was using the same lotion on them that I used on my face.  But it didn&#x27;t seem to last long on my hands (particularly since they tend to be washed numerous times through the day).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eucerin Hand Repair has done the trick.  I put this one once in the morning an it keeps my hands most, but not greasy, all day long.  On occasion I&#x27;ll need to apply it once more during the day - but that is rare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be using this product every winter.</li>
    <li> This Hand Cr&amp;egrave;me is very silky and smooth. Great cream. I wash hand in very warm water and then pat dry hands then smooth on the Cr&amp;egrave;me before I get to bed at night and wake up with nice soft hands that had soften over night. Would buy again. Thanks!</li>
    <li> great stuff !  really thick,  so a little goes pretty far,  wish it came in a jar as the last little bit is hard to get out.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied With a very comfortable Not greasy This is the only hand cream that helps my hands survive winter. I tried 10 different hand creams until my dermatologist suggested this one and from that moment on I only use Eucerin Hand Cream.</li>
    <li> So soft in my hands.. gives moisture i always put into my hands after i wash the dishes.</li>
    <li> Best hand cream I have ever used. Would continue to buy regularly. Keeps your hands smooth throughout the day without that greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> Im always concerned when I purchase a new hand lotion because I cannot stand overly slimy feeling lotion on my hands.  I can&#x27;t even count how many times I ran straight to the sink to wash lotion off (which sort of defeats the purpose).  This lotion feels very rich and creamy and after just a few seconds feels velvety ... not greasy at all.  I like this so much I&#x27;m going to check out their body lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and this hand cream is truly unscented unlike many that claim to be.</li>
    <li> Nice. I haven&#x27;t been consistently using it though.</li>
    <li> I have atopic dermatitis. Seems to work well for travel. I was able to bring this with me on my trip to Japan and it kept my hands moist without bothering security. Not easy to find this in other stores.</li>
    <li> This product works wonderfully. Really softens up all your dry areas and absorbs so nicely. Almost like a light balm. Absolutely no residue. However, I don&#x27;t know why they still have not gotten rid of the parabens!  This is 2014 and most eco- and health- conscious companies have done away with the parabens.  There are tons of other safe preservatives out there.  Eucerin get with the program!</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and I am particularly uncomfortable in cold weather.&lt;br /&gt;This helps a lot.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright. Nothing fancy. Average results and feel</li>
    <li> Good hand moisturizer that fits great in my purse.  Seems to be doing what it is supposed to.  Nice little product.</li>
    <li> Great hand cream, I use it usually in the winter.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I purchased this to replace my Eucerin Plus Intensive Body Cream they stopped making.  I actually use it on my upper lip and notice a big improvement on those fine lines.</li>
    <li> For work, I have to wash my hands frequently throughout the day. This is the best hand cream I have found so far.</li>
    <li> My index finger was chapped because I wash dishes and my pet&#x27;s cage by hand.  I put a little of this lotion on after my hands have been in water.  My index finger is no longer chapped.  It doesn&#x27;t work instantly.  About a week of daily care is all my hands needed to get better.  This lotion is now my go-to for preventing rough looking hands and fingers.</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry skin and this lotion works miracles!! I just wish I could get in bigger quantity bottle, not just small tubes....</li>
    <li> This is hands-down the best hand cream I&#x27;ve ever tried. I do my nails a lot and tend to get really dry hands once the weather gets chilly. My cuticles turn into a brittle mess and it&#x27;s plain ugly. The first day I bought this I applied it probably four times, putting a little extra focus on the cuticles. It absorbs pretty quickly but your hands do feel a bit coated (but lightly, and softly) for a bit, but it&#x27;s not sticky or greasy. A few days later my hands, after applying it about three times a day, felt a lot softer overall and my cuticles look probably 80 percent better. I intend to keep using this, especially all through the winter. It&#x27;s a life-saver!</li>
    <li> Best lotion ever - I was obsessed with the foot stuff but it&#x27;s a little greasy so I got this for my hands &amp; it&#x27;s exactly what I need/want for long, dry winters.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for several years.  It is good stuff.  I just need to have a tube at every possible spot, I guess, so that I remember to use it.</li>
    <li> I love this cream. It absorbes quickly and has no smell.</li>
    <li> I always keep a bottle in my purse or diaper bag. It really helps my dry, sometimes cracked, skin. It&#x27;s a good value in that it isn&#x27;t crazy expensive, and it never feels overly greasy on my skin.</li>
    <li> I actually got this for my face and dry skin. This particular cr&amp;egrave;me is somewhat thicker than those that just run out of the bottle. It appears to keep my forehead much more moist than the watery brands. You buy a bit more but as you get older, better maintenance is always good. Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> Got 4 of these because we use it all winter to keep our hands for cracking. Not greasy and seems to work well.</li>
    <li> Thick and rich and healing. Now here&#x27;s what I&#x27;m talking about!</li>
    <li> This lotion smoothed my dry, rough, cracked hands but it didn&#x27;t leave my hands feeling soft or moisturized. It was not an overnight process. It took several days of regular use for my hands to get better and they are still not 100%.  I am guessing that if I am diligent with other lotions, I may get the same results and other lotions come in larger bottles (this tube is small).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s light and non-greasy which is a plus. It&#x27;s also not heavily scented which is good. I will continue to use this lotion but probably will not re-order due to the lack of moisturization.</li>
    <li> It is not at all greasy, absorbs quickly, and leaves your skin very soft and smooth. After regularly using it through the winter, I have not had a single instance of cracking and bleeding on my hands, which I normally would have had.</li>
    <li> It does moisturize but is kinda greasy when applied.  It eventually soaks in but depending on when I want to use it, I don&#x27;t always have the time for the soaking in process and I&#x27;ll grab something else.</li>
    <li> This Eucerin creme is rather pricey, but it does seem to really help with severely-chapped hands.  I use cheaper creme on a daily basis, and the Eucerin when things are bad.  I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I am required to wash my hands 10x + a day with alcohol based hand sanitizer, and then again 4-5x with solutions like chlorhexidine so it definitely takes a toll on my skin. I used this lotion every night and within a few days my skin was noticeably healthier. Bleeding stopped, cracking was almost gone, and my hands looked 100 times better. Excellent for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars, totally recommend.</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I was looking for and worked exactly as described. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> My HG hand cream!  Works better than brands 5-20 times more expensive.  Trust me I&#x27;ve tried them all!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m bald with no hair on top. My scalp becomes very dry and flaky. So, several months ago I received a sample tube of this cream. It was terrific for chapped hands, so I tried it on my scalp.. Now, the scalp dryness problem is solved. What I really like is that the cream leaves no slippery residue. My scalp feels dry, but no flakiness or itchiness.</li>
    <li> i love this stuff! it has a soft scent, so a guy wont be afraid to use it and it works! i wash my hands alot so i use this every night and i have very soft hands. i love this stuff!</li>
    <li> This product is the best I&#x27;ve found during the dry cold winter season. My skin has really been taking a beating this year. I&#x27;ve tried several products including the other Eucerin creams. This one has been the best.</li>
    <li> This is the best hand repair cream I have ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;I work outside, and usually my hands are so dry and cracked that&lt;br /&gt;they bleed.  not anymore : )</li>
    <li> My girlfriend tried it and said it made her hands smoother than any other lotion so I assume that is a good thing.</li>
    <li> I usually use the Norwegian hand cream but when this was under $2/tube I decided to try. It is good but I still prefer Neutrogena&#x27;s Norwegian hand cream.</li>
    <li> As a person with very dry skin in a dry climate, I have tried a lot of hand lotions, many of them ridiculously expensive.  The truth is, the expensive ones are no better than this bargain lotion.</li>
    <li> I bought this hand creme to complete a minimum free shipping order, and I am very happy I did.  It has helped my dry hands during this very cold spell.  It is not greasy, and soaks into the skin immediately.  I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> The best hand cream ever made.</li>
    <li> Hands get dry because of frequent wash with water. With Eucerin I felt the difference right away. Very good product</li>
    <li> I bought several of these to leave in the car and around the house.  It does not make my hands greasy but helps with the dryness around the cuticles as well.  Good product.</li>
    <li> Only hand cream that fixes my dry cracked hands and my husband&#x27;s. No more painful handwashing.  Other lotions sting after application, but not this one. It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Perfect consistency without the greasy feel.  It is expensive and I use a lot since I have contact dermatitis with washing my hands.  Wish it came in a large container!! I can&#x27;t get enough.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this a couple of times so that I was giving it a fair shake. I really wanted it to be the be all, do all since my winter hands are super dry and my cuticles are raggedy as all get-out... This is just OK -- I wish I could be more positive... I&#x27;ve had other &amp;#34;rich&amp;#34; creams that did at least as good a job and were certainly not priced any higher. Maybe my expectations were just too high... I&#x27;ll keep using it till it&#x27;s gone but I don&#x27;t think that I will actively seek it out once this tube is empty.</li>
    <li> With skin that needed repaired desperately I decided to give this a try after few others failed, within a week of using this hand cream at least twice a day, I noticed the change, I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> This hand creme is the best I&#x27;ve ever tried. It works quickly, and it does leave a greasy feeling. I recommend this product to anyone who has dry hands.</li>
    <li> good lotion, is not too thick where it feels gross and greasy- but still thick enough to get the job done and moisturize well.  I was my hands alot and live in very dry climate so my skin needs help or it cracks and bleeds.  this helps!</li>
    <li> Since I am constantly washing my hands throughout the day, I use this during the evening hours.  This works for me, whereas other products I&#x27;ve used did not.  I was trying to avoid getting breaks/cuts on my hands (which really hurt) especially during the winter because of my dry skin.  I do use it everyday now.  Keeping hydrated and drinking lots of water greatly helped my skin also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been purchasing this from Target in the past but they were out of stock during my last few visits.  This made me look for the product on Amazon and I found it much cheaper, so I bought six!  I am very happy now.</li>
    <li> I use several creams to keep my hands NOT-dry. I use the l&#x27;occitane (this is the best) at home but did not want to take it to work and leave it here. So I got this one so I can leave at work. Seems to do its job well.  Great value for the price.</li>
    <li> love the feel and my hands are a mess, cracked bleediing&lt;br /&gt;and its very painful,.this stuff is great! just wish it came in&lt;br /&gt;bigger tube or a pump bottle, give it a try you cannot lose</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry skin due to medications and now add diabetes into the mix and i feel like i have not had a drink of water in years. put this on and my skin stops burning and no more bad or curing or splitting cuticles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely dry skin due to medications and now add diabetes into the mix and I feel like I have not had a drink of water in years. put this on and my skin stops burning and no more bad or curing or splitting cuticles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;have to change my opinion of this product. I was WRONG. It just does not stay with me, so I have switched to Eucerin Original Healing Repair Cr&amp;egrave;me strength RICH.&lt;br /&gt;I use the jar about 3 times a day ONLY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I am taking Coconut oil 3000 mg. I take 3 gel capsules at bed time, this also seems to help me. This product states it should be taken 3 gels 3 times a day. that was too much for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My apologies to any one who has read my original review and thought it might work for them. Best wishes on your search for something to help you with your Extremely Dry Skin control.</li>
    <li> Maybe if you&#x27;re hands aren&#x27;t overly dry and cracked but as a mom who washes her hands a million times a day, this gave my hands no relief at all.</li>
    <li> I do love the feel of my hands after I use hand creme.  I keep a tube by kitchen sink, next to bed and one in my purse.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Eucerin for about 30 yrs. I use their other cream on body core and limbs, and this on my hands. It&#x27;s not greasy, quickly absorbed and great for everyday use. If it has a scent, my super sensitive nose doesn&#x27;t detect it. This is light enough that I occasionally use it on my face if I&#x27;m out of Oil of Olay.</li>
    <li> Best on the market!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion because I like Eucerin products a lot and I wanted a small bottle to keep in my purse. I happen to suffer from Dyshidrotic Dermatitis, a form of eczema, which started a few years ago. Well, I&#x27;m shocked but this has totally helped with Dyshidrotic Dermatitis, which I never expected. In retrospect, I guess it makes sense. It calms the itch and seems to prevent flair ups. If I don&#x27;t use it, they come back of course, but at least I&#x27;ve unexpectedly found a solution for an annoying problem. The lotion feels great, isn&#x27;t too greasy, and there&#x27;s no funky smell. Absorbs well. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Eucerin is a wonderful product, and this formula for very dry skin is no exception.  If you find that you have dry, itchy skin or have a profession where you frequently wash your hands, this product is a must have.  It does have a slightly greasy feel upon initial application, but absorbs quickly and nearly waterproofs your skin for hours thereafter.  You can wash your hands after usage and your skin will still be protected.  Wonderful barrier and re-hydrating lotion that heals and protects very dry skin anywhere you may have it!  I keep it in my purse at all times and have given it as a gift to others I work with.  Small, compact bottle perfect for travel or in your desk drawer.</li>
    <li> I love this hand cream. I use it on my elbows and heels, too. It&#x27;s very thick and not at all greasy, with a very light scent.</li>
    <li> I have super dry skin and I keep this small tube in my purse--a little goes a long way and it doesn&#x27;t make your hands all slimy when you get them wet. I&#x27;ve noticed this is the brand that nurses tend to use....</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry hands and I get excema on them in Chicago&#x27;s colder months.  My hands crack and bleed in winter and actually get sore from being so dry.  My dermatologist recommended this and gave me some free samples.  It worked so well that I bought a few tubes and now this is all I use for my dry hands in Fall/Winter.  I gave some to my dad because he has the same problems, and he loves it too.  It heals the dryness without being greasy or oily.  I&#x27;ve also tried lathering it on my hands before bed and covering them with cotton gloves overnight, and it works wonders.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand why everyone says this is not greasy.  It certainly feels greasy to me.  I like how it feels when I&#x27;m putting it on, but it looks very shiny when dry, and my hands are slippery.  I certainly couldn&#x27;t open a jar or anything with a smooth top while wearing this hand cream.  I can&#x27;t speak to the long-term benefits since this is the first time I&#x27;ve tried it, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
    <li> Great deal. I love the texture. It is creamy but easy to absorb. It is better than many expensive ones. I will subscribe it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, it feels like silk!</li>
    <li> This cream has a subtle scent and is not greasy. My job causes rapid dryness in my hands and this product keeps them moist and stops the cracking and roughness. I recommend it to anyone with very dry hands.</li>
    <li> Really the only hand cream that stops hangnails.  Just a dose of this every night before bed really helps.  It also doesn&#x27;t just wash out in the morning like many others.</li>
    <li> I love this hand cream.  I receive it through subscribe and save since I now can&#x27;t live without it.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants a good hand cream at a great price.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I use Eucerin product.  I usually use it after bath before I go to bed.  I find my hand silky smooth the next morning.  Before I buy &amp; use it, my hands were dry &amp; a bit itchy.  After web search, I try this hand cream &amp; the effect is surprisingly good.  Now I drop all my old cream &amp; lotion, and keep on using this excellent cream, my husband use it as well.  Most important of all, it is reasonably priced.  I highly recommend this value-for-money hand creme to everybody.</li>
    <li> My hands love this cr&amp;egrave;me during these brutal N.E. winters.  I keep some in the car, purse, kitchen and on my nightstand.</li>
    <li> If you have dry skin, buy this!</li>
    <li> This product contains parabens.  Parabens are chemicals which react potentially negatively in the human body.  While the actual effects of parabens are up for debate, and I am sure this is within a tolerable level, I feel it&#x27;s better to steer clear of such chemicals.</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE BEST HAND CREAM I HAVE YET TO FIND.  I JUST WISH IT CAME IN A BIGGER SIZE. FOR NOW I HAVE TO KEEP BUYING THE 2.7 OZ. .BEGGARS CAN&#x27;T BE CHOOSERS..GLAD TO HAVE &amp;#34;ANY SIZE&amp;#34; OF THIS GREAT PRODUCT.  BIGGER SIZE....PULEEEZE  !!</li>
    <li> The creme is rich enough to turn my dry hands to a smooth feeling. It is small enough in my purse to go everywher with me. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I originally bought the CVS brand of this exact hand creme because they didn&#x27;t have the actual Eucerin product in stock. That worked immediate wonders! The next time I was at a different store, I picked up Eucerin&#x27;s product and it&#x27;s just as good if not better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every winter for the last few years, I&#x27;ve experienced constant dry, cracked and bleeding hands. This product has changed that. The search for the perfect hand creme is over!!</li>
    <li> Helps prevent hangnails and keep cuticles soft.  Recommended by my dermatologist.  Inexpensive as an add-on to an Amazon Prime order?  There are several products with nearly the same name so choose carefully.</li>
    <li> this stuff is pretty good. i have been using all kinds of lotions/creams, only that it is so expensive, loses a star.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and frequently wash my hands. This is one of the best hand creams for the price out there. I wish they sold it in larger bottles.</li>
    <li> Best handcream I have found and I have extremely dry hands.</li>
    <li> Okay hand cream. Rich, but have to really wait for the winter dryness to give it the real test. My hands do not feel moisturized for any length of time after some I am not hopeful.</li>
    <li> moisturizing and not greasy. Love it!</li>
    <li> My hands get very dry in winter.  Other drug store hand creams I tried are not as rich as this one, so I have to re-apply often.  With this cream, I only apply it at night and it lasts me all day.  Highly recommend.  If you don&#x27;t mind spending $$$, get La Mer hand cream, but this one comes very close to getting the same results.</li>
    <li> Absorbs quickly into hands and makes them feel very soft.  Has made my dry cracking fingers like new again.</li>
    <li> Great for elderly damaged skin</li>
    <li> Completely fragrance-free and non-greasy, which I really like. But for intensive repair, it&#x27;s not as strong as other hand lotions I&#x27;ve used. Good, but not exceptional.</li>
    <li> I use it on my hands and yes they are very smooth and soft and look very nourished, planning to search for some big ones in the same brand.</li>
    <li> My wife gets cracking around her finger tips during the winter and this is the only thing that will work within a days time.  It is pricey, but works after a couple applications to moisten the toughest dried out skin.</li>
    <li> Really good hand cream</li>
    <li> I got this hand cream when it went on sale and it was a life saver for my dried out skin during the winter. A small bit of this cream goes a long way in relieving dry and chapped skin. The ointment is absorbed well and won&#x27;t leave a sticky residue but rather leaves the hands feeling smooth and velvety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can be added on as a subscribe and save item so that the shipping is free. The one problem with the great deal on this product is that it was out of stock when I needed it most in February!</li>
    <li> Was a gift, and was very well received!</li>
    <li> Great product. Love the size. Keep them in my purse,  car, desk and kitchen. Works wonders</li>
    <li> Eucerin PLUS Intensive Repair Hand Creme  was a great product until the manufacturer reformulated and removed the Plus from the formula. The new product, while they claim it is the same product, is not the quality of the Plus product that they use to offer. Major mistake from the makers of  Eucerin  Hand Creme</li>
    <li> Love this lotion. It&#x27;s not a miracle cure but does soften the skin, has no smell, absorbs quickly, and most importantly doesn&#x27;t irritate cracked and chapped skin. I use this every night and when I can remember during the day...</li>
    <li> The best hand creme I have found so for,  it really helps with my dry cuticles.  I use it a couple of time every day and my hands look great...I love this product.</li>
    <li> keep this in my gym bag love it</li>
    <li> Great winter-time hand cream!  My husband and I both have dry hands and this is great relief for them.</li>
    <li> Melts into your skin and not thick. This is my favorite lotion!</li>
    <li> This is the very best hand cream I&#x27;ve ever used!!  I have been using it for years and plan to use it for many years to come.  It absorbs very quickly and does wonders for my hands.</li>
    <li> This hand cream works very well on my dry hands.  Leaves them feeling soft without being greasy.</li>
    <li> Non greasy and works better than any other brand I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Love this cream. I&#x27;ve tried quite a few others including Neutrogena, but this makes my hands feel really soft and stopped the dry feeling I get. I also like the fact that there are no fragrances and it seems to stay on my hands even after I wash them.</li>
    <li> Winter means dry cracked hands but when you use Eucerin Intensive Repair Extra-Enriched Hand Creme, 2.7 oz. your hands will heal and feel softer than ever without feeling greasy</li>
    <li> Close to the best hand cream I have found.</li>
    <li> This is the only Eucerin formula I like. All the other ones have mineral oil in the ingredients which is just awful stuff! I&#x27;m not sure why the different formulas but this one works well for a hand cream in the winter and fits nicely in my purse.</li>
    <li> Good lotion, it really helps my dry hands and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue. the smell isn&#x27;t strong either, which i like.</li>
    <li> Really fast shipping. Like the Eucerin Intensive Repair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this a few days, but the split skin on my fingers is already healing fast. I garden and raise orchids indoors, as well as all the usual household chores that involve water and chemicals. My hands have been a mess for a long time, but there is hope now.</li>
    <li> Great for dry cracked hands!</li>
    <li> This hand creme is the best hand repair creme I have ever had.  It really helps my skin throughout the cold, windy, winter months here in Wyoming.  I love  the small tubes as I carry it in my purse to use throughout the day no matter where I am.  A great product and a great price!</li>
    <li> Not thrilled with the texture, I prefer thicker, richer creams and this is just a bit greasy.</li>
    <li> I was in need of a hand cream which doesn&#x27;t leave the skin feeling oily, this just does that. I do have dry skin and I feel the dryness worsen after washing hands. Living in Minnesota, the cold makes things worse and this just does its best. Doesn&#x27;t have any fragrance which works best in work places and helps avoid attention. The other product I used to use from Bath and Body fills the room with fragrance and turns few heads towards me :) The tube handy enough to carry around and rub it on your hands for 20-30 seconds there is no greasy residue.</li>
    <li> hope it is little smaller that I can carry everywhere.</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite hand lotion.  I had wrecked cuticles and dry hands, and this leaves my hands feeling sooo silky!  It moisturizes so well, it&#x27;s definitely worth every cent.</li>
    <li> Love it! Bought it on a total whim one day, my hands were dry, cracking, and incredibly painful. tried it and fell in love.  It now stays in my pocket at work (I&#x27;m a nurse) and I never have an icky after feel.</li>
    <li> Lasts long, not oily, no smell.</li>
    <li> Great hand cream.  Not greasy, skin feels soft for a little while after applying.</li>
    <li> love this brand hand cream</li>
    <li> Attention, they must have changed the formula very recently. This product I received feels differently from what I&#x27;ve used before. not so impressed any more. when it&#x27;s applied, the hands are often very greasy for a while. If you happen to wash your hands very quick, this ones becomes a big hassle to keep on. I want the original formula&#x27;s back.</li>
    <li> The cream is very good for my super dry hands.</li>
    <li> I love it!!!excelente, Eucerin is an amazing brand! Very good product!!! Will buy again, this hand creme is the best/</li>
    <li> belive me folks,&lt;br /&gt;i tried lotions, to greasy,&lt;br /&gt;i ordered  gloves on line,  to hot for my hands,&lt;br /&gt;i tried olive  oil  at home, to greasy.&lt;br /&gt;but this gets me threw YUKKY winter,,,&lt;br /&gt;i hate winter,&lt;br /&gt;But Winter  Drys out my Hands Really bad,&lt;br /&gt;a Tip From Me&lt;br /&gt;DONT USE HOT WATER ALOT IN WINTER TO WASH YOUR HANDS  as  it drys out your hands more By Experience!!!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hand lotion.  It is super moisturizing and non greasy.  The only down side is the cost.</li>
    <li> One of the best hand lotions I&#x27;ve ever tried. My hands used to crack and peel, but not with this lotion.  One of my favs.</li>
    <li> I heard about this lotion on a TV show and decided to try it. It was an add-on item on Amazon and made the price even better. The lotion is awesome. Softens my hands (use it almost every night), and I even use it on dry patches on my face during the winter months. Works just like the experts say it should.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews here and at GH and decided to give the Eucerin Intensive Repair Extra-Enriched Hand Creme a try.  I think it is as good as anything on the market today. It is very rich and absorbs nicely . I only had to use a small amount, and it seems to last a long time. Also, I love that it is unscented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like so many things, however, It comes down to personal choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter&#x27;s hands get raw and chapped and are very sensitive. Her go-to hand cream is Udderly Smooth. She tried the Eucerin and liked that too. However, when her hands were at their worst, she said the Eucerin burned a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said, I liked the cream so I give it 4 stars.</li>
    <li> Great in the winter, does not leave a greasy feeling like most hand lotions</li>
    <li> I really like this hand lotion.  It makes my hands feel so good, and it stays on for a long time.</li>
    <li> I have severely dry skin and I find that this product burns a little in some of the most chapped areas of my hands, like on the backs of my knuckles. It does soak in pretty well, though, leaving no greasy after feel, but it is not immediate, it takes a few minutes.</li>
    <li> This is a great lotion and convenient size for a purse or bag. I was looking for a lotion for really dry hands from the winter cold. Eucerin is a great brand and within a few days of use this healed my extremely dried out hands and cracked knuckles. It&#x27;s not too thick or rich considering how moisturizing it is; it is a lightweight lotion. It also has a slight exfoliant apparently, so dry skin will come off and your hands will get super soft in no time. I will definitely be reordering. Really impressed!</li>
    <li> As a mom I wash my hands all day long. As a knitter, my hands get a lot of wear and I can&#x27;t have dry hands catching on my yarn. I love this hand creme. It really makes my hands feel &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; again not dry. It absorbs quickly so I can get back to work without worrying about getting lotion all over my needles and yarn. A little goes a long way, which I also love. I keep a tube in my nightstand, diaper bag, purse and glove box.&lt;br /&gt;Be careful- don&#x27;t leave it laying on its cap because it tends to leak.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s comfortable.My husband skin is very dry , the creme is extra-enriched.</li>
    <li> I wanted to give this hand cream a try. After the first use I knew I would have to go back to Neutrogena !&lt;br /&gt;I like the feel on my hands but it is not really efficient.</li>
    <li> I love it! Although my mom would prefer o&#x27;keeffe hand cream.</li>
    <li> leaves my hands feeling greasy</li>
    <li> This lotion does just what it says. Immediately after applying you can feel it working on the skin and after about two minutes it absorbs without leaving a greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> good for using after take shower and washing the hand. it is very mositure. the sale price also very good</li>
    <li> I work with nitrile/latex gloves all day and wash my hands all the time so they are dry. I put this cream on every day and my skin has improved a lot. Great product.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product! It is the only hand cream that prevents and repairs the damage on my hands from the dry winter air.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good~I like it.I will be back soon.So i will take ti more.It&#x27;s very very good.It&#x27;s very very nice.</li>
    <li> Michael.Stone(International graduate student from China)&lt;br /&gt;Here is some of my personally view that may help u~&lt;br /&gt;1.no strange smell.&lt;br /&gt;2.no greasiness.&lt;br /&gt;3.cheap but useful(cause I got $2 discount,only pay 2.66+tax,maybe $3 I think) and I think it is also worth to pay the list price $5!</li>
    <li> My hands are much smoother, without the chapped areas around my nails. Seems that the &amp;#34;Intensive Repair&amp;#34; works as stated. Great product. Thanks for making it.</li>
    <li> It is a great hand creme for my severely dry hands; lasts long.  The price is right too.</li>
    <li> good  i will buy it ain！&lt;br /&gt;very good</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s the first time I use Eucerin products. It exceeds my expectation with its rich and smooth effects after applying.</li>
    <li> I have excema on my hands and through using this product after anytime I get my hands wet I rely less on the steroids I&#x27;ve been prescribed. It is not great and as a bonus (in addition to minimizing the excema) my hands are soft.</li>
    <li> I love this for my hands they are looking less dry from this cold weather and younger by using this! Now if I can keep my little one from thinking he has to use it!!!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin so I really should have known better than to use a product like this without doing a spot check first. Much like everyone reviewing this I had severely dry winter skin and this product sounded like a dream come true. I applied the lotion after washing and drying my hands before going to bed for the evening. As I laid in bed I realized my hands felt a little odd. Then the burning set in. I ran back into the bathroom to wash off the lotion and after thoroughly scrubbing with soap the burning stopped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if like me, you have sensitive skin, I would pass on this product.</li>
    <li> I actually had a doctor recommend this to me for extreme dry hands/rash, and it is amazing stuff. Non-greasy and soaks in quickly. I use it on my feet before bed, too. I go through a few tubes each winter, and at Amazon&#x27;s price you can&#x27;t go wrong. Do not confuse it with Eucerin&#x27;s &amp;#34;Plus Intensive Repair Lotion&amp;#34; which is greasy even though it is lighter.</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful and has been great for my hands this winter. I have four small kids and am always washing my hands, resulting in rough, cracked, painful skin. This cream is very soothing, and even better - it&#x27;s not greasy. Best hand cream I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Just used this for the first time tonight. As soon as I put it on my hands they started to sting and burn. They aren&#x27;t even that dry! No other cream made my hands hurt like this.</li>
    <li> this is a great moisturizer and makes it under the TSA 3 ounce rule</li>
    <li> Non greasy, fragrance free, softens skin</li>
    <li> The Eucerin hand creme is the most effective I have used.  My hands are very dry and I use this product a few times a day.</li>
    <li> this is my favorite hand cream.</li>
    <li> Great lotion. My hand is in a constant state of healing, as I am a nurse that washes my hands to much, and I have eczema. This lotion doesn&#x27;t quite cut it for that, but otherwise does a fantastic job on my hands.</li>
    <li> throw one into your purse or your drawer at work, no smells to irritate sensitive noses, not greasy, eases dryness after hand washing</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a nurse so I&#x27;m constantly washing my hands which leaves them very dry. Love this lotion as it dries quickly with no greasy after feel, (which I hate), and really seems to work well. Instant relief for dry, cracked hands. My husband loves it too.</li>
    <li> I have dry hands.  This is more intense than regular lotion, but not by a whole lot as far as I can tell.  It does soothe quite well, and the tube is a good size - I like to keep it in my car and lotion my hands on my way to work.  People seem to really like this... I like it, just don&#x27;t love it.  Worth a shot if you have excessively dry hands.</li>
    <li> This is great. Moisturizes my hands with absolutely no greasy feel, which is amazing and I never thought I&#x27;d find. I wish it had a scent, but that&#x27;s just a personal preference. For those wondering, it really doesn&#x27;t have a scent at all.</li>
    <li> This is the product my doctor recommends, but it&#x27;s not always in stock on our local store shelves - great price and speeding shipping.  Two thumbs up.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion so much because:&lt;br /&gt;- it&#x27;s so hydrating without leaving my hands oily&lt;br /&gt;- it quickly absorbs into my skin and leaves them looking and feeling soft and supple&lt;br /&gt;- it lasts a good while even after I wash my hands (but of course lasts longer - like all day - if I haven&#x27;t washed between applications&lt;br /&gt;- it&#x27;s the perfect size to fit in my desk drawer at work, the cubbyhole in my car&#x27;s dashboard, the interior pocket of my purse, and anywhere else I need a bottle of good, reliable bottle of lotion.&lt;br /&gt;And, while I do wish the price was a dollar or two less or at least a value pack deal, it lasts a good while because a little does go a long way and I need that because I tend to have dry and ashen skin, especially in the winter and this little lotion works quickly to resolve these concerns.</li>
    <li> This lotion is great, I buy a bunch of it every winter it keeps my hands from getting dry and cracked.</li>
    <li> Have been using this lotion for years and really like it.  It goes on non-greasy and provides a protective layer that lasts through a washing.</li>
    <li> Good lightweight moisturizer that absorbs quickly and works well with my dry skin and other chronic dermatology issues. Been using it for years.</li>
    <li> Being a homemaker I find my hands in water often.  This cream is vey u seful in keeping my hands moist as well as during the winter months my hands are not as soft as I would like them to be and the Eucerin is most useful .  I would recommend it.  The cost is reasonable.</li>
    <li> We get this as re-fill every month. Great</li>
    <li> it really works as mentioned..i tried many products but this is the one which make your hand really smooth.</li>
    <li> Best stufff I have ever used for dried cracked hands!  Leaves NO oily feeling.</li>
    <li> Great hand cream, does stay on hands though so if that bugs you not as great</li>
    <li> This is not the PLUS hand cream. I believe Eucerin has discontinued it. Rather, this is the Intensive Repair hand cream. I will keep it since the product seems good even though I was expecting my old favorite, the Plus cream.</li>
    <li> it is goog, but to small, i expected it could be bigger, as the picure showed. a little bit disappointed</li>
    <li> The cream  is very rich and effective. Now my hands look better and they feel silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Heal those cracked hands!</li>
    <li> This is, hands-down (no pun intended) the BEST hand lotion I have ever tried!  It is not greasy, has no odor, goes on smoothly, and really hydrates without leaving a sticky film on your hands.  I use it multiple times a day, every day.</li>
    <li> The best hand cream I&#x27;ve used and, believe me, I&#x27;ve tried them all.</li>
    <li> My all time favorite hand cream.  I have sensitive skin and love, love, love this product.</li>
    <li> wish it came in a larger tube love the stuff wish it was not so expensive but it is the only thing I can use to keep my hands from splitting</li>
    <li> A little bit greasy feeling for a non-greasy lotion</li>
    <li> couldn&#x27;t beat the price. love eucerin products. good small size for the purse or gym bag.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, but thick.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not bad but not outstanding.  And the price is about the same as you buy it at a store.  It&#x27;s not greasy and that&#x27;s good but I will search for a better cream.</li>
    <li> takes care of my v dry hands</li>
    <li> Handy size, price was great, keep a couple here and there. Great quality product. I wash my hands many times a day and this stuff works very well.</li>
    <li> that&#x27;s good and not that experience.</li>
    <li> This hand lotion is very greasy, shiny and It gets on everything I touch after I use it. This lotion is terrible. Still searching for a eucerin product that works well for me.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff because if you rub it into your hands, it doesn&#x27;t leave your hands feeling greasy.  So you can use your phone or keyboard and not leave gunk behind.</li>
    <li> wonderful lotion for my hands.  I work in health care so LOTS of hand washing and coupled with the cold winter, my hands get very dry and chapped easily. This works well!!  good price and quick delivery so I never run out.</li>
    <li> Nice hand cream.i enjoy it.</li>
    <li> Great product for dry itchy hands and value priced.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff. My hands get nasty dry. Not just in the winter, but all year from washing them. I work on a computer, and using lotion typically makes my keyboard greasy, which I hate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This absorbs quickly, isn&#x27;t sticky, and leaves my hands silky. I use it on my disgustingly dry arms less often and it&#x27;s even more effective because I don&#x27;t wash my arms every time I use the bathroom.</li>
