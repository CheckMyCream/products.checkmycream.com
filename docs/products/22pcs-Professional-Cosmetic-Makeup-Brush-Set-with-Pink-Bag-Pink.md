      <li>Work pretty good and love the case they come in, makes it so easy to put away.</li>

      <li>own these and real technique ones.</li>
      <li>My makeup goes on smoothly using these brushes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re cheap and you get what you pay for.</li>
      <li>Came in perfect condition and was exactly what I expected.</li>
      <li>My old brushes feel apart one by one, looking forward to having a nice full set again!</li>
      <li>but the brushes are very soft and looks really nice</li>
      <li>I was worried these would be crappy brushes due top the low price, but they are great!!!</li>
      <li>They are super soft and really cute</li>
      <li>so I instantly tried pulling all of mine apart and couldn&#x27;t, so that was nice.</li>
      <li>looks exactly as it does here, comes brand new, good quality brushes, they&#x27;re soft too.</li>
      <li>It is such a cute case too</li>
      <li>I use these so much!</li>
      <li>But just a dot of hot glue and there stuck again.</li>
      <li>The bristles are a little stiffer than I thought it would be (though still weally soft)  was more efficient and easier to use and with that I was able to do my makeup in half of my normal time, not to sure if that had to do with the brushes more so than the adrenaline</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very particular when it comes to what brushes I use on my face for my makeup.</li>

      <li>I love pink.</li>
      <li>&amp;#34; haha</li>
      <li>But really they fall apart when you are using them</li>
      <li>love these brushes due to the durability and the softness..</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re OK probably not really worth the wait.</li>
      <li>I mean, they are not the best quality, but you get about 10 brushes for less than 5 dollars.</li>
      <li>The bristles of the brushes are very soft and the material is very durable.</li>
      <li>To my surprise, they&#x27;re very soft, work well, and no shed.</li>
      <li>Plus it came about 3 weeks early !</li>
      <li>They are softer than an e.l.f brush I just bought which is super rough!</li>
      <li>The brushes are soft, and the hairs never fall out.</li>
      <li>when I purchased a cheap wet n wild brush for about the same price as this set</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast and price is low.</li>
      <li>I normally use M.A.C. And bare essentials brushes</li>
      <li>As soon as I got this I opened it up and the too girly side of me came bursting through with OMG, its so fwuffy and soft.</li>
      <li>gave to my sister so far she likes it.</li>
      <li>The brushes were soft and don&#x27;t fall out when used.</li>
      <li>All and all I am pleased with these brushes, just bumbed about the cute case I had to toss :(</li>

<li> They are not cheap and the brush and all the hairs stay intact even after being washed.</li>
<li> Since the product was so cheap, you would think the brushes would be terrible quality, but this is not the case.</li>
<li> and it&#x27;s really frustrating.</li>
<li> so I was sad that I instantly had to throw it away :(</li>
<li> but I have really expensive brushes and they also fall.</li>
<li> i ordered these as wedding shower favors and some came in with bad brushes, broken ends and dirty bags</li>
<li> SO BAD</li>
<li> it made me gag and gave me the worst headache as soon as I opened them.</li>

    <li> gave to my sister so far she likes it.</li>
    <li> Cute brushes nice case it comes just as pictured</li>

    <li> looks exactly as it does here, comes brand new, good quality brushes, they&#x27;re soft too. great price and worth the wait. completely satisfied</li>
    <li> Took about a month to arrive, only reason for the 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;I love these brushes due to the durability and the softness..&lt;br /&gt;can&#x27;t forget, they are non shedding! My makeup goes on smoothly using these brushes.&lt;br /&gt;I own these and real technique ones. Love them all!</li>
    <li> As soon as I got this I opened it up and the too girly side of me came bursting through with OMG, its so fwuffy and soft. The bristles are a little stiffer than I thought it would be (though still weally soft)  was more efficient and easier to use and with that I was able to do my makeup in half of my normal time, not to sure if that had to do with the brushes more so than the adrenaline I got from the excitement of using them. Its a 4/5 though because I had 2 brushes with bristles a bit skewed.</li>
    <li> I thought I&#x27;d be getting what I paid for but I am really impressed with this set and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Came apart almost immediately</li>
    <li> I love the colors of these brushes. They&#x27;re cheap and you get what you pay for. Only one of the brushes i got started falling apart, aside from that though they work perfectly okay.</li>
    <li> These are okay. The brush part of them is great except they gp fall apart so easily! But just a dot of hot glue and there stuck again. But really they fall apart when you are using them and it&#x27;s really frustrating.</li>
    <li> Smaller than I thought it would be, but a great gift for my cousin. Shipping was fast and price is low.</li>
    <li> I use these so much! Work pretty good and love the case they come in, makes it so easy to put away.</li>
    <li> it took a while to get to me but i was skeptical about buying this product because i thought it would feel cheap but the brushes are very soft and looks really nice glad i purchased this</li>
    <li> Love these brushes. After losing all my makeup and brushes I needed to replace. I normally use M.A.C. And bare essentials brushes but I couldn&#x27;t afford to replace them all. I got this set for super cheap and they work great. when I purchased a cheap wet n wild brush for about the same price as this set I was surprised how great the quality was. They are super soft and really cute</li>
    <li> Loved it ! Plus it came about 3 weeks early !</li>
    <li> Love the brushes they are cute the bristles fall off but I have really expensive brushes and they also fall.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been needing a new set and these are perfect. They are not cheap and the brush and all the hairs stay intact even after being washed. Love them!</li>
    <li> These brushes took a while to come in (about a month) but I&#x27;m happy I received them. They are very pretty and soft. I&#x27;m very particular when it comes to what brushes I use on my face for my makeup. These definitely get the job done for an even application. If you don&#x27;t mind waiting for a while because they come from overseas then I would greatly recommend these brushes.</li>
    <li> I finally got my brushes today! they are really pretty, mine are deep purple and pearl white with white and pink on the brush heads. I have heard that these fall apart as soon as you get them so I instantly tried pulling all of mine apart and couldn&#x27;t, so that was nice. I would love to give these a 5 start rating BUT they smell of chemicals SO BAD it made me gag and gave me the worst headache as soon as I opened them. It&#x27;s not the brushes that smell, it is the case!!! It is such a cute case too so I was sad that I instantly had to throw it away :( To whom ever said &amp;#34;I have read a lot of comments that peoples brushes stunk, so what...&amp;#34; haha oh no, let me tell you this is like paint chemicals magnified by like 10!! It almost smells like pesticides!!!! But I love the brushes, they are beautiful and sooooooo soft. They are softer than an e.l.f brush I just bought which is super rough! All and all I am pleased with these brushes, just bumbed about the cute case I had to toss :( Once you let the brushes air out out of the case they don&#x27;t smell bad like the case :) nice brushes and very pretty!</li>
    <li> this set of makeup brushes is very beautiful. The bristles of the brushes are very soft and the material is very durable. very good buy for the price.</li>

    <li> They are pink. I love pink.</li>
    <li> Okay brush set. I mean, they are not the best quality, but you get about 10 brushes for less than 5 dollars. It took me 20 days to get this item though.</li>
    <li> Great brushes for an excellent price! All of the brushes arrived with cracks in the paint of the handles, but the brushes still work well regardless.</li>
    <li> I was worried these would be crappy brushes due top the low price, but they are great!!! Comes with eight pieces in a cute case and there ACTUALLY GOOD QUALITY!</li>
    <li> i ordered these as wedding shower favors and some came in with bad brushes, broken ends and dirty bags but most was fine. very cute and very cheap.</li>
