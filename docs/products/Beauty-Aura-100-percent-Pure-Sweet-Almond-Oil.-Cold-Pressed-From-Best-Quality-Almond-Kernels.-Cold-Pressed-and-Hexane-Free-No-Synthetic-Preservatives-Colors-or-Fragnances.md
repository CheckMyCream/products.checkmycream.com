<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I got purchased this for $1.00 with free shipping because I am a member of Amazon Review Trader. I love this product. I read that almond oil has a lot of beauty uses including treatment for aging. I used this product to make a lip scrub with honey and sugar. I also used it to take of my makeup and to use it on my hair. I had a almond oil party with this stuff! I love how its not really greasy. I had my mom try it on her hands and body. She absolutely loves it and she&#x27;s pretty picky considering she only uses designer fragrances, so if she loves it, my guess is anyone will love it! I absolutely recommend this product! you can make lip scrub with it and hair masks and use just by itself! indulge yourself with this sellers Beauty Aura 100% pure sweet almond oil!</li>
    <li> My sweetheart and I thought this stuff would be amazing to play with.ðŸ˜†&lt;br /&gt;As it turns out this stuff is amazingly absorbent. Leaves skin smooth, not at all greasy, and gives your skin a pretty shine.&lt;br /&gt; Its awesome for my skin! (not so much for a sensual slippery interlude with hubby. heehee)</li>
    <li> High quality and smells great. It moisturizes my skin so well.</li>
    <li> Great pure product in a simple bottle. I think personally, this is a great purchase! The lid is tight and the product won&#x27;t spill after you&#x27;ve broken the seal. This oil smells amazing and is definitely fresh and ready to use</li>
    <li> This oil feels light to the touch yet hydrates&lt;br /&gt;really well.  I mix it with everything from my&lt;br /&gt;eye cream to help treat dark circles to my&lt;br /&gt;makeup base.  It even helps dissolve stubborn&lt;br /&gt;eye makeup.  Smells neutral and penetrates the&lt;br /&gt;skin very well without leaving it oily.  This oil&lt;br /&gt;can be used alone or as a carrier oil for other&lt;br /&gt;treatments.  Either way, it&#x27;s one of those oils&lt;br /&gt;you can&#x27;t live without due to it&#x27;s versatile nature&lt;br /&gt;and complex nutritional profile.  I highly recommend&lt;br /&gt;this oil to anyone for treating a multitude of skin&lt;br /&gt;concerns.</li>
    <li> A fine oil. I yes this by my bed in place of personal lubricant.  It does not have much of a smell or taste.</li>
    <li> This oil is a great value.  I&#x27;ve paid much more for similar oil for smaller portions.  I did receive this at a reduced rate in return for a review, but even full price is a good deal.  The oil has no odor  and is 100% almond oil.  It comes in a bottle with a flip-top dispenser.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product! I tend to have very dry skin on my body.. especially my legs, and this Almond oil works amazing! When I purchased this item, I was pleased that is was 100% natural but was unsure what &amp;#34;cold pressed&amp;#34; meant. After researching, I found that it means that it is derived at a lower temperature thus retaining its natural qualities, such as flavor, aroma, and nutritional value. I also found out that products made in this fashion are of higher quality and the process is costly... so you can expect a much higher cost... although this is not the case with this product! I compared prices online and at local health food stores and did not find even 1 that was cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;I use the oil everyday after my shower, and I have no more visible flaky skin. My skin feels soft and smooth, and I have even notices that I get less shave rash on my legs! This is truly a nice product!  Discounted for honest and unbiased opinion</li>
    <li> This is a new product for me!&lt;br /&gt;  I have tried a veriaty of oils for my hair since I started using natural stuff in my hair journey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I used this product on my hair for a deep conditioner and I have to say that I love it. One thing about this oil is that it penetrates deep in my hair and it keeps it moisturized. My hair did feel smooth and it has a shine to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Just a note if you use it as a leave in don&#x27;t put to much because it weighs your hair down, but it don&#x27;t matter if you keep your hair in a bun or if you are not going any where.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Almond oil is rich in vitamin E and magnesium, which both are great for nourishing your hair. Regular scalp messages may bring shine and promote hair growth which is what I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Also the surplus amount of fatty acids in the almond oil may help strengthen hair and preventing hair loss and hair breakage which is also something that I want and need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  You don&#x27;t need to stop on your hair only the almond oil is also good to sooth and help counteract skin conditions as  itching, dryness, and inflammations I have not tried this but it is good to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like this product and I am going to add this to my regimen.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product with a promotional discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> i love this! It makes my skin so soft and smooth. I also like to use it in my hair before I shampoo it leaves my hair feeling so silky. It is good as a natural makeup remover. i also like to use it as a prep before I shave my legs and again on my legs after I shave them. This is so nice it isn&#x27;t sticky and dries leaving softness not oiliness. I am going to order more when I am out! I received this for an honest opinion.</li>
    <li> It really has no scent and made my hair feel a little greasy, but if just using for your skin, It is a great moisturizer!</li>
    <li> This Sweet Almond Oil is so light and non-greasy. I have been using it around my eyes and it has started to diminish the dark circles and my skin is so soft. The packaging was great. It was wrapped in plastic and taped. The paper on the top of the main container that is usually sealed onto the rim itself was almost off, but nothing leaked out.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to try more of the Beauty Aura Oils.</li>
    <li> The Sweet Almond oil was delivered and about 1/8 th of the small bottle had leaked, and had coated the inside of the plastic baggie wrapped around the bottle, as well as the outside of the bottle.  This is, however, a shipping issue. (update, the seller was outstanding, and refunded us for the purchase price immediately upon hearing of the shipping mishap)  We purchased the Almond oil in a promotion for testing and review, and there was still more than suitable amount left for sampling, so we decided against returning the bottle.  I have used it on my hair and scalp, as well as some dry itchy patches on my skin.  It makes for an excellent, pure moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Finally I&#x27;ve found an oil lightweight enough to use on my hair and skin! Does wonders on my dry itchy skin as well as helps with my hair !</li>
    <li> Great quality, non greasy.  I bought this a a carrier oil for massage and it works great! No worries about being sticky, greasy or stinky.  Love it!</li>
    <li> This oil works great for body skin and hair. I used it to message my body and also applied to my hair. One this I notice my body absorb this oil really fast and smoothen my skin. I read couple of article from internet that describe many other benefit of this oil. Highly Recommended</li>
    <li> I was given this as a gift last year, and have just now reordered a bottle. (though I meant to get the larger bottle~) This product goes a long way with a little, and assists with main skin ailments. Even an alternative to chemical laden shaving creams. (can&#x27;t use lathering soaps, as they dry out my face too much) Though I will wash my face again to take off excess. I recommend this product to any looking for alternatives to lotions with chemical ingredients, and anyone trying to simplify their hygiene routine. it can easily be applied to wet or damp skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like many other people seem to have a packaging issue with the seal. I&#x27;m a little concerned on that part, as this is a hygiene product. The packaging should be sealed properly for quality and safety reasons.</li>
    <li> This brand has amazed me. It&#x27;s quality made and last for a long time. I use this to cut my EOS and have been impressed with the results. I was asked to test/review this product and have been impressed. I will continue to use this oils and try other oils.this brand makes.</li>
    <li> So I have already tried Castor oil and Grapeseed oil of Beauty Aura brand and I really liked them both so when I was offered Almond oil at discounted price I jumped on the opportunity and grabbed it.I am an Asian and in our country we prefer oils over any other moisturizer, almond oil has always been my favorite since childhood.So here are the pros:-&lt;br /&gt;1.It&#x27;s thinner in consistency than Castor oil but thicker than Grapeseed oil which makes it perfect moisturizer for dry and normal skin types.&lt;br /&gt;2.It&#x27;s excellent for hot oil massage on your hair.It moisturizes your hair and reduce frizziness and prevent hair loss and breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:-&lt;br /&gt;1.I was expecting a familiar sweet almond oil smell like back at my home country but this Oil is scentless.&lt;br /&gt;2.I got super excited as I was using this oil after such a long time so I used a bit extra than normal on my skin and became sticky mess so don&#x27;t do the same mistake, use very little quantity.It takes a bit time to get absorbed in the skin so be careful where you sit immediately after applying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Natural ingredient takes time to show the result so be patience and believe me you will be amazed by the results.I got this at discounted rate in exchange of my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> I use this product on my hair, body and face. It works amazingly well with keeping my body and hair moisturized. I am an African American woman with dry hair and just a few drops keeps my hair smooth and moisturized all day. I use it when I get out the shower and it makes my skin feel and look so moisturized and healthy. It also makes for an excellent makeup remover. I wear matte, liquid lipstick which is notorious for being long wearing and hard to remove. This oil removes it with ease. And it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and cause me to break out which is a concern of mine since I suffer from adult acne. For optimal results for your hair and skin, I suggest mixing this pure sweet almond oil with this company&#x27;s pure grapeseed oil. Together, they are wonderful for your everyday hair and skin needs and will give you the best results. This is now a permanent part of my hair and skin care.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted price so that I may give you all my honest and unbiased opinion. I highly recommend it to you all, my family, and friends.</li>
    <li> I love almond oil.  The smell is heavenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchase this item solely to use in place of shaving cream and it did not disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> LOVELY oil!!  Use this in my essential oil rollerballs and nightly face serum!!</li>
    <li> There is endless uses for this great product but I personally love it for my face</li>
    <li> Great product, does not smell like cardboard.  faint sweet smell.  nice texture! extremely happy with the product</li>
    <li> This sweet almond oil is 100%, cold pressed and hexane free that&#x27;s why is good for skin and hair. It&#x27;s lightweight and and not greasy at all. Skin feels so soft because its rich with natural vitamins such as A, E and B. I use this when I massage my kids back and they really love it! My daughters use this to their hair after bath and that made their hair look healthy and silky touch. Of all the oil my kids tried, this is their favorite! Will continue to use it and will buy some more later when we ran out of it!</li>
    <li> This oil has a very light, sweet, almost fruity fragrance to it.  As a massage. oil or as a body moisturizer, I prefer to mix it with a thinner, faster absorbing oil, so it doesn&#x27;t sit on the skin as long.  Discounted sample provided for review</li>
    <li> This Pure Sweet Almond Oil by Beauty Aura has so many great uses. Not only is it a great moisturizer, but it can also be sued as a carrier oil for essential oils, as a massage oil, as a makeup remover, and much more. It has absolutely no harsh chemicals or synthetic ingredients and it is refined so you can rest assured knowing it is completely pure. Very much worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Product received for testing and review. All thoughts and opinions are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this oil. I have been using it as a carrier oil for essential oils that I use after my shower. It leaves my skin soft and smooth, without any irritation or feeling overly greasy. It&#x27;s not overly heavy and absorbs quickly. This would also work as a great massage oil. I will definitely be purchasing another bottle. It&#x27;s my favorite carrier oil right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was received either at no or low cost for review and inspection purposes. No compensation for a positive review was provided. All of my reviews are based 100% off of my experience with the product and I never guarantee a positive review.</li>
    <li> Received this item empty as it split all over the box.</li>
    <li> Product for Review: This is my first time using this company and oil. I have to say, I really like it. :)</li>
    <li> There are very many benefits/uses for Sweet Almond Oil. Almond oil is rich in vitamin A, B, and E which is great for the skin.  It&#x27;s great for chapped lips, body rashes, dry/irritated skin, dark circles under eye, and hair care.  I could create an endless list of benefits of using almond oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have the 4 oz. bottle of sweet almond oil by beauty aura.  It is a good quality product and very light oil.  I plan to use this oil to make hair and beauty products with it but for now I used it as a moisturizer on my arm.  The oil is so light it my skin immediately absorbed it without leaving the horrible greasy feeling that some oils do. I suffer from eczema and I have naturally dry skin but this oil made my arm feel smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almond oil also helps make your lashes fuller and luscious.  Clean an old mascara wand and add a few layers of almond oil to those flashers every night before bed.  It takes about a month to notice a difference because of the growth scale of eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received a discount on this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.  I enjoy writing reviews and put a lot of effort into how I feel about the products. I think it is important as consumers to make a well informed decision before purchasing a product.</li>
    <li> Almond oil was my saving grace throughout my pregnancy!  I wanted to use a safe moisturizer that I knew didn&#x27;t have any harmful chemicals and since you can eat almond oil, I was totally comfortable using it as a moisturizer.  I started using this a few weeks after I found out I was pregnant and was super-generous when using it on my belly.  I also didn&#x27;t get a single stretch mark!  I know they say that is totally genetic, but I have stretch marks on my hips from a growth spurt as a teenager, so I&#x27;m a believer that the sweet almond oil helped!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI, since I was so generous when applying throughout my pregnancy (at least 2 times a day), I made sure to wear a tank underneath my clothes for the day, just to be sure my outer clothes didn&#x27;t get stained, since there was a little oil that soaked through during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping and would totally purchase again!</li>
    <li> This oil is great! I use it on the tips of my hair, since it&#x27;s so damaged, and I can definitely see an improvement! I also use this oil on my cuticles, and they are much softer now.</li>
    <li> Very good product, I used on my skin and as a hot oil treatment. My hair is so soft, silky, like no damage was done to it from all the years of dying it. I will definitely be using more of this oil.</li>
    <li> Love this prooduct. I use almond oil in my body lotions, bath fizzies, etc.. this oil works awesome.</li>
    <li> I love almonds and I have never owned almond oil before. I was very excited to get this item in the mail, specially because I purchased this item during a one time promotional period! The oil arrived very well packaged inside a plastic bag. The bottle itself is made out of clear plastic and the top lid allows the oil to be easily poured onto the hand or finger. The oil is a pale yellow color with a corn like scent and has a pretty liquid consistency. The size of the bottle is perfect to carry around in my purse and while traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil is very quickly absorbed into the skin and is very gentle, it does not cause any irritation or discomfort. I use the oil everyday as a moisturizer and apply 2-3 drops of oil onto the dry area. The oil does not leave greasy feeling and ever since I have been using this oil on my skin my skin looks healthier. The natural vitamins and antioxidants of the almond oil help recover, moisturize and strengthen dry, itchy and irritated skin. This oil is also great to give foot rubs, not only does it feel great but it also soothes and nurture the skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also read several articles about almond oil repairing damaged hair. I am excited to use a couple drops of this almond oil in my shampoo to soften and naturally moisturize my hair. This is my first time purchasing an item by Beauty Aura and I am very pleased! The oil has no added ingredients and is pure natural oil. This is premium quality sweet almond oil offered at a great price.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I used almond oil. I like that this oil is very light not greasy and no bad odor. This oil works best for my hair.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have anything to say about the oil itself, but agree with other reviewers that the bottle leaks.</li>
    <li> I use almond oil as carrier oil for my essential oils among other things.  Almond oil is a light to medium weight oil and it can stain clothes and sheets so be careful. The Body Aura 100% pure sweet almond oil has no scent and is enriched with vitamins A, E &amp; B. It also has antioxidants as well as omega 3 fatty acids. This oil works as a great moisturizer. The oil also works as a eye makeup remover, helps brighten your complexion, may also help ease dull aches and pains when used as a massage oil. This oil is great for skin conditions such as itching, dryness, inflammation, and burns.&lt;br /&gt;If my review helped you, please click on &amp;#34;helpful&amp;#34; below. Thank you. :)&lt;br /&gt;I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW.</li>
    <li> I purchased the 100% Pure Sweet Almond Oil to use as a base for my other oils to turn into lotions. and perfume rolls. I made my own Lotion, Massage Oil, and Perfume Ball Roller  I like how this Almond oil softens my skin, and the scent isn&#x27;t overbearing,It has a light, sweet smell once rubbed into the skin, and heated up.  Which is also why to me it makes the perfect  base to blend other scents into with.  I created a Almond Oil + Peppermint Oil Massage oil.  When it&#x27;s on my skin, it gives it a soft, cooling, massage effect when massaged in. I really like the results on my skin, and the scents of the natural oils.  I also used it as a massage oil, I think it feels amazing on my skin. A little really does go a long way when using this Pure Sweet Almond Oil.  I have been on an Natural Oil kick lately, and just collecting all kinds of Oils to create my own scents.  I noticed where I was spraying my perfume on it was irritating my skin from all the alcohol in perfume, so I wanted to make a better alternative, and that is why I went to Natural Oils.  I received product as a discount rate for my opinion.</li>
    <li> Almond oil is wonderful for the face and skin. It does not clog pores. It can be used to remove make-up, and can also be used to clean the face. It relieves dry skin and helps with dark circles under eyes. It helps to relieve skin rashes, fine lines and wrinkles. There are numerous uses for this oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to the coconut oil I have, this oil is thicker and a little stickier when applied but it does absorb very quickly. It&#x27;s yellow in color. It&#x27;s a great carrier oil for essential oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had issues with the packaging like many others and had issues where the oil was leaking in the box. I hope they fix this issue. Luckily mine didn&#x27;t really lose a lot of oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this pure sweet almond oil for multiple uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received a sample of this product at a highly discounted price in exchange for a detailed and honest review. The fact that it cost me very little has no bearing on my rating or review of the product - this product has earned the rating I have given it.</li>
    <li> Great results and smell.</li>
    <li> I love what this does for my hair! The weather out here lately has my hair going nuts and I couldn&#x27;t find a balance with anything I tried until I went back to almond oil. I&#x27;ve used almond oil for my hair as a kid but forgot all about it until recently. After several days of use (hair mask one day then a couple drops on the ends after every wash) my hair doesn&#x27;t frizz up as much and feels a lot softer than before. Since I don&#x27;t really use that much, 4oz should last me quite some time. This specific product has no smell and arrived well packaged. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received this product at a promotional price for product review purposes. All opinions are my own and reflect my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> It soaks in quickly, has no odor and does not leave a sticky residue on the skin. It is also a great massage oil light almond oil, just what you would expect.silky not greasy, lovely. Will use this to make my own brown sugar scrub, hair treatment, body moisturizer.This is my favorite all round carrier oil for essential oils, with many benefits and a non greasy feel. Sweet almond also works great when making salves and body butters, look up recipes if you want to make some with your favorite essential oils.</li>
    <li> I love sweet almond oil , this is the only thing that helped me with my dark circles. I heard about it on YouTube and I was super excited to use it. The best part of it is that it is all natural!! This product was given to me for a review and I would recommend it</li>
    <li> Moisturizing light oil for skin and hair.</li>
    <li> Mine arrived leaking all over the box, so I only got about a handful left.  It smelt nice, but couldn&#x27;t try it out.</li>
    <li> Quality of oil appears to be high, it is a very light yellow/brown, has no odor at all. I have been using it in a facial cleansing oil I make. I also use it for carrier oil for essential oils at times. The price is right for the size of the bottle and is a good value. The only reason I am knocking this down to 4 stars is not the oil or quality if it at all. During shipping the bottle cap came loose and the inside the bag it was in was a wreck. The oil had soaked off part of the label. It was sealed in a plastjc bag by itself so nothing else was hurt in my order. Would I reorder again? Yes I would, I understand a cap can come loose. The oil itself is great, Made in USA, cold pressed and Hexane free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a few other uses for this oil. I make a home made flax seed hair gel for extremely curly hair. I made a batch yesterday and it worked wonderful! Worked great as cuticle oil. I havn&#x27;t used it yet for feet, but it should work great for pedicures also, a few drops in warm water for a soak. I have a little really itchy dog and have tried everything, ans short of steroids nothing helps and she is to old for that anymore so i had ti find alternative ways to combat this problem. I now mix oil in an oatmeal conditioner, I use tea tree, almond, grapeseed, jojoba or coconut usually and add 2 teaspoons to a couple ounces of conditioner add a little water and use it as a rinse and she doesn&#x27;t itch to bad for a couple days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received this product on a promotional discount for my honest review and they are 100% my own opinions.

    <li> The shipping on this product is amazing, received this package less than a week. The package was pack &amp; top secured so there was know leakage for this oil bottle. Nice size bottle if you need to carry around with you and easy to store. Since this bottle was a see throw bottle I store it underneath the sink to keep the oil at room temperature. Easy to use the flip top or easy to screw off for easy pouring. Very light oil great for finger nails cuticles which is why I order this oil in the first place. I use this oil by itself direct on the fingernails cuticles &amp; I use almond oil plus warm water to soak my whole hand into. This oil is also good for dry body parts. I notice if I warm the oil just a little bit in the microwave the oil help the dry skin come off my foot better. I notice I don&#x27;t have to wait days for my feet to look good, the oil is a instinct makeover. When I give myself a foot massage it good to warm up the oil as well. The smell is very faint so nobody know I am even using the oil.</li>
    <li> again another great product for natural beauty and ailment remedy products so many differnt uses and again beautiful skin when used in skin products</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff! So multi-functional. Product came nicely sealed with no leaks, I would highly recommend.</li>
