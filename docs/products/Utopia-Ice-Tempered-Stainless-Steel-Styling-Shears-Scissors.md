      <li>Awesome sharp scissors.</li>
      <li>They work and are easy to control.</li>
      <li>Not as good as a high end pro set</li>
      <li>The blades ran smoothly against one another.</li>
      <li>The results were great especially considering the price.</li>
      <li>But, for the price it&#x27;s not a bad pair.</li>
      <li>very clean silver and cuts very well.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t expect super high-quality shears at this price</li>
      <li>They arrived quickly and sufficiently packaged.  </li>
      <li>They are lighter weight than desirable for me, but may be adequate for those used to working with these.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure why these had so many good reviews.</li>
      <li>but I would have liked them more if they were a little sharper.</li>
      <li>These styling scissors were not quite what I expected, but they are good quality for the price.  </li>
      <li>Sharp and good value.  </li>
      <li>Honestly, I have a pair of nice fabric cutting scissors that work better.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>The only thing I would change is a bit more the angle on the finger hole.</li>
      <li>Since I married my barber</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only used them on my bangs, and they did the job fine, but not with super precision.</li>
      <li>Nicely tapered and sharp.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ll be back to stock up for more as soon as I&#x27;m ready.  </li>
      <li>I only used the shears for a quick trim but for the price they were adequate.</li>
      <li>br /&gt;you get what you pay, it was cheap, so yeah.&lt;br /&gt;the blade wasn&#x27;t super sharp but did the job</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>Fast Shipping.</li>
      <li>They performed well  straight out of the box when I bought them five months ago.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say too much about scissors.</li>
      <li>Saves me so much money</li>
      <li>but they are very inexpensive for what you get.</li>
      <li>The hair goes straight between the blades.</li>
      <li>I tried tightening the screw but that didn&#x27;t help much.</li>
      <li>so I cannot comment on much.</li>
      <li>Would recommend for anyone needing good above average scissors for haircuts.</li>
      <li>The finger holes were a decent size.</li>
      <li>I gave myself an all around trim and my hair looks normal.</li>
      <li>and  get new ones can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
      <li>It does have a guard for the bottom fingers but the holes are exactly the same size and too lined up.</li>
      <li>and they cut as good as the much more expensive shears I&#x27;ve been using over the past couple years.  </li>
      <li>The only issue Ive had is that you have to hold them a certain way otherwise they just pull and won&#x27;t cut well.</li>
      <li>So far no complaints,</li>
      <li>Arrived fast in the last week.</li>
      <li>Sharper than the old scissors I was using, but still pushed the hair when I cut.</li>
      <li>but my initial impression was very favorable.</li>
      <li>I gave my husband, who has thick curly hair, a haircut the day I got them, and for the first time in our marriage I got it done quickly</li>
      <li>Since that pair of shears has a rounded point, and I&#x27;m new to cutting my own hair, I really haven&#x27;t used these shears all that much...don&#x27;t want to poke myself in the ear with these sharp shears until I&#x27;ve become a little more proficient at doing this task.  </li>
      <li>I think i should have spent a little more money</li>
      <li>These scissors were not sharp at all.</li>
      <li>These scissors were a $5 add on item to replace a similar pair that were about 30 years old.  </li>
      <li>But they appear to be well made shears and well worth the small price tag on them.  </li>
      <li>I ordered these shears as backup at my barber shop and found that I&#x27;m using them first everyday now.  </li>

    <li> I got these shears not realizing that a pair came with the cordless hair trimmer that I also ordered at the same time.  Since that pair of shears has a rounded point, and I&#x27;m new to cutting my own hair, I really haven&#x27;t used these shears all that much...don&#x27;t want to poke myself in the ear with these sharp shears until I&#x27;ve become a little more proficient at doing this task.  But they appear to be well made shears and well worth the small price tag on them.  Maybe a pro hair stylist wouldn&#x27;t agree, but I ain&#x27;t no pro stylist...just looking for items to make cutting my own hair easier without making the &amp;#34;cut&amp;#34; look more &amp;#34;butchered&amp;#34; rather than &amp;#34;styled&amp;#34;!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. I use scissors like these to trim my bangs and cut off obvious split ends. Honestly, I have a pair of nice fabric cutting scissors that work better. But, for the price it&#x27;s not a bad pair.</li>
    <li> Very and very excellent  and faster shipping</li>
    <li> Bought these for my wife, she likes them. Great price, she&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy. Fast Shipping.Can&#x27;t say too much about scissors. Thanks</li>
    <li> Nice to have a full size pair of scissors again. Hard to find them locally at a reasonable price.Since I married my barber I get immediate feedback. She seems to like them quite a bit.</li>
    <li> These scissors were not sharp at all. It was bending my hair instead of cutting it. I felt like it was pulling on my hair.</li>
    <li> I looked at a lot of scissors. I am not a barber but these worked great for me . They get dull you throw them out and  get new ones can&#x27;t beat the price. I would definitely buy again. If you have a lot of money buy the expensive ones spread the wealth. Have a great day.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice scissors at a good price. We&#x27;ll see how it holds up with use but my initial impression was very favorable.</li>
    <li> These shears work great. Saves me so much money so I can trim my own hair. Clean cut ! !</li>
    <li> Very comfortable to hold and easy to use. I gave my husband, who has thick curly hair, a haircut the day I got them, and for the first time in our marriage I got it done quickly and with out any kind of hasstle. His co-workers even complemented his hair, so that automatically makes them amazing in my book!</li>
    <li> Inexpensive and sufficient for my purposes. I didn&#x27;t expect super high-quality shears at this price so I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for the value and smooth haircut, as described it is Hand-crafted for optimum control, balance and comfort with extra sharp cutting edges. No defects. Arrived fast in the last week.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sixty plus years old and these scissors are the worst pair of scissors I&#x27;ve encountered ... Save your money!!!</li>
    <li> Sharper than the old scissors I was using, but still pushed the hair when I cut. They&#x27;re not even suitable for trimming bangs. I&#x27;m not sure why these had so many good reviews.</li>
    <li> Really great for the price. Nicely tapered and sharp. I was able to trim my bangs easily. The only thing I would change is a bit more the angle on the finger hole. It does have a guard for the bottom fingers but the holes are exactly the same size and too lined up.</li>
    <li> The scissors didn&#x27;t jam up on me. The finger holes were a decent size. The blades ran smoothly against one another. Shipping was great and arrived before the estimated date. Smooth gliding when I was cutting my bangs. The results were great especially considering the price. I gave myself an all around trim and my hair looks normal. I loved these scissors. I was skeptical after reading the reviews but decided to try them anyway. Great decision.</li>
    <li> Use these to trim daughter&#x27;s bangs. They work and are easy to control. Not as good as a high end pro set but they are very inexpensive for what you get.</li>
    <li> Very light.These cut pretty good - esp. for the price. I think i should have spent a little more money but i like these.</li>
    <li> Great love these scissors!!! very clean silver and cuts very well. I just love love love love these scissors check them out guys</li>
    <li> They performed well  straight out of the box when I bought them five months ago. As other people have mentioned, they were certainly tight to open and close. But at least they got the job done. But lately, they can&#x27;t even cut a clump of hair. The hair goes straight between the blades. I tried tightening the screw but that didn&#x27;t help much. I guess I&#x27;ll be discarding this $5 pair and going for something more expensive now that I have some experience cutting hair with scissors.</li>
    <li> very good. they last about a year. we use them twice a month to cut my very thick hair!&lt;br /&gt;compared to those which last the same but cost 2x or 3x the amount&lt;br /&gt;good deal!</li>
    <li> The scissors look nice and the shipment was quick. I&#x27;m can only give 4 stars as I have not used them yet so I cannot comment on much.</li>
    <li> I ordered these shears as backup at my barber shop and found that I&#x27;m using them first everyday now.  Very nice feel when holding these shears and they cut as good as the much more expensive shears I&#x27;ve been using over the past couple years.  I&#x27;ve decided I&#x27;ll stick with these for a while and I&#x27;ll be back to stock up for more as soon as I&#x27;m ready.  Very good Purchase!&lt;br /&gt;Keith Rawls, The Fitzpatrick Barber Shop, Fitzpatrick, Alabama</li>
    <li> it was alright&lt;br /&gt;you get what you pay, it was cheap, so yeah.&lt;br /&gt;the blade wasn&#x27;t super sharp but did the job&lt;br /&gt;it was a bit hard to operate because the blade was a little bit bent so the tip was scrubbing each other a bit,&lt;br /&gt;its not that obvious but you kinda feel it</li>
    <li> I only used the shears for a quick trim but for the price they were adequate. So far no complaints,</li>
    <li> For the record, I am not a professional... But i just cut my hair &amp; these shears did a great job!</li>
    <li> Excellant grooming shears.</li>
    <li> These scissors were a $5 add on item to replace a similar pair that were about 30 years old.  They arrived quickly and sufficiently packaged.  They are sharp and cut well.  They&#x27;ll be used to cut hair every few weeks and I expect them to last as long as the prior scissors they replace.</li>
    <li> I used to trim little one&#x27;s hair.  Sharp and good value.  Would recommend for anyone needing good above average scissors for haircuts.</li>
    <li> good scissors to cut my dog with.</li>
    <li> These styling scissors were not quite what I expected, but they are good quality for the price.  They are indeed sharp, although they require a little adjustment to be tightened.  They are lighter weight than desirable for me, but may be adequate for those used to working with these.  For the price, I&#x27;m happy they&#x27;ll get the job done.  I&#x27;m just not certain they&#x27;ll be around for longterm use.</li>
    <li> As others reported, there is a small, visible gap between the blades, so I wonder how well they can work. I&#x27;ve only used them on my bangs, and they did the job fine, but not with super precision. Happy scissor hunting!</li>
    <li> They are great for the price I paid and will work for my purposes but I would have liked them more if they were a little sharper.</li>
    <li> These are EXTREMELY sharp!  You could cut an ear off!</li>
    <li> Awesome sharp scissors. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I got these in February to cut my dogs hair to save on going to the groomer. She&#x27;s a Westie and they cut so beautifully. These are SO SHARP. be careful you don&#x27;t poke yourself with the tip or cut yourself on the blades. The only issue Ive had is that you have to hold them a certain way otherwise they just pull and won&#x27;t cut well. I would get these again and recommend them. I gave it 4 stars because of the cutting issue.</li>
