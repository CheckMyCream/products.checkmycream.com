      <li>I love the colors!</li>
      <li>I love to play with colors and designs!</li>
      <li>But once I got the hang of it I love them!</li>
      <li>well I got exactly what I wanted an awesome set of nail art polishes</li>
      <li>Great to manipulate for easy use.</li>
      <li>The product is great and easy to useüëç</li>
      <li>It arrived in a nice size cardboard box with bubble  tubes to prevent the boxes from moving.  </li>
      <li>i regret buying this, honestly.</li>
      <li>I guess I could trim them, but that&#x27;s kind of a hassle.  </li>
      <li>I purchased these for doing my own pedicures and nail designs.  </li>
      <li>Smells to strong but good colors</li>
      <li>I really loved this product it was easy to use</li>
      <li>The color does not come out very easy</li>
      <li>Very good and fast</li>
      <li>the shipping was good, it got here in pretty good time</li>
      <li>I do admit it can be a challenge as it is very fine, but if you do it in good light, it should be not problem.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>They are very easy to use and love the way you can play with on your acrylics</li>
      <li>I opened the plastic cap and removed the orange cap that held a very fine pin that goes into the hole at the top.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m pretty happy for the most part.</li>
      <li>They are really good and relatively easy to use, there&#x27;s the option for the fine tip pen or the brush which I didn&#x27;t realize until I got them and started playing with them.</li>
      <li>These were a nice concept but the product is not that easy to use.</li>
      <li>, a greater selection would be nice to add to it, but this is fine for your basics, plus a gold and silver metallic.  </li>
      <li>ok so I got these because I do my nails about 3x a week myself</li>
      <li>This nail art pen is okay to use.  </li>
      <li>love the colors.</li>
      <li>However, I did tried most</li>
      <li>There is a cap you pop off, then a pin you pull out of a at the top  that dispenses the polish from the needle size hole.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll probably order more.</li>
      <li>Everything arrived safely.  </li>
      <li>The polishes didn&#x27;t come in any sort of box or package for presentation or gifting, so one might have to get creative if gifting these to anyone.</li>
      <li>I love these and plan to order more when I need to resupply.</li>
      <li>and I needed some more colors,</li>
      <li>and they are still doing ok.</li>
      <li>I have used them several times already and am very happy with my purchase!</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>The colors are great and very pigmented, the packaging is ok.</li>
      <li>I love this product</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t love the brushes.</li>
      <li>You are better off using dotter tools and your favorite polish if you want them for that..</li>
      <li>I would probably order these again if I can&#x27;t find something better .</li>
      <li>i dont remember seeing more than 2 glittery ones in the picture, but then again, the pic is nothing like the products i recieved</li>
      <li>many colors are glittery.</li>
      <li>These are two of my favorite items.</li>
      <li>They come with a needle so that the top will never block up</li>
      <li>The hole is very fine so that you can make fine lines.  </li>
      <li>but for what i like to do its pretty good.</li>
      <li>theyre pretty good.</li>
      <li>, i was so excited when i got them!</li>
      <li>, they are great, vibrant, and easy to use.</li>
      <li>I loved it works very well and not bad&lt;</li>
      <li>as for quality, they&#x27;re not bad, I&#x27;m sure theres better</li>
      <li>easy to use just takes alittle practice.</li>
      <li>EASY TO USE MULTI SIDED NAIL PENS....</li>
      <li>The fine metal tip will bend easily if you don&#x27;t replace the cap correctly.</li>
      <li>It was fine and the polish is opaque, so 1 coat will do.  </li>
      <li>but they work just fine.</li>
      <li>work just fine.</li>
      <li>and while it&#x27;s true they didn&#x27;t come in any kind of packaging, they were still worth it...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m opening up my own beauty salon and having these pens are so handy when trying to do designs because it&#x27;s quick and not messy...</li>
      <li>I tried out some colors on the same day and was very satisfied!  </li>
      <li>They are really easy to use and fun to have!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Awesome deal. Fast shipping. These pens are just as good as Migi pens.</li>
    <li> Love these little things. Great to manipulate for easy use. Multiple colors to chose from</li>
    <li> After reading the other reviews I was afraid to order this product, but considering the price, I thought I&#x27;d take the risk.  Everything arrived safely.  I tried out some colors on the same day and was very satisfied!  I don&#x27;t see a metal pin anywhere though.</li>
    <li> Super easy and fun to use. Jazz up regular polish And bring out your inner artist! I love to play with colors and designs!</li>
    <li> 5 of the nail art pens didn&#x27;t work! They also happened to be main colors...black, white, blue, silver and green!! VERY disappointed!</li>
    <li> I love this product it&#x27;s the same like mijicolors  and it&#x27;s worth the price.and I love it I do recommend this product.</li>
    <li> For the money I think this was a good purhcase. I will say it was a little difficult to get these pens started. The nail polish did not seem to want to come out at first, and after alot of effort I eventually got it and now they all flow fine. Also, becareful when placing the cap back on these pens. The fine metal tip will bend easily if you don&#x27;t replace the cap correctly. Lastly the color they call purple I think is more a pink color, but overall for the price I am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> The brushes were irregular, so on some bottles I have to use a different brush than the one it came with.  I guess I could trim them, but that&#x27;s kind of a hassle.  The colors are good.</li>
    <li> One of them leaked I&#x27;m the mail which wasn&#x27;t too bad, but paint won&#x27;t come out of the pen part on half of them and it comes out to fast on the other half. Some of the paints are thin and kind of see through which is annoying and there is no little needle thing for unplugging the pen part as far as I could see.</li>
    <li> I loved it works very well and not bad&lt;br /&gt;It looks just like the picture and had a little problem but It worked out well and I got new ones sent&lt;br /&gt;They have the pen and look very well organized and nice</li>
    <li> Kinda thick and globby. I do nails for a living, thought I&#x27;d give these a shot. The packaging they came in sucked. One leaked all over, so it was pretty much ruined. Not real pleased in general. I&#x27;ve used them maybe once or twice. Actually when you can find them the nail art pens from Rue21 are so much better IMO.</li>
    <li> I love them and highly recommend to anyone that wants to buy.  They are very easy to use and love the way you can play with on your acrylics</li>
    <li> I decided to try these and I&#x27;m pretty happy for the most part. The dotter side comes out too fast and it&#x27;s so hard to put the cap back on without bending the metal tip. It takes me a few tries. You are better off using dotter tools and your favorite polish if you want them for that.. I don&#x27;t use the dot side anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The striper side: Sad to say that after you open and use them around 5/6 times, they start getting thick. My black one I had to throw away because it was the most used. I&#x27;ve had the others for a few months and use them often and they are still doing ok. On a better note I really like the colors. Except the light pink which is too transluvcent to see.</li>
    <li> I love them and the only reason I gave them up a 4 I think they could come up with a better way than the little pins to seal them back closed</li>
    <li> I like the products however both the yellow and white exploded in transport and almost half of the polish is gone now. I also can&#x27;t remove the interior caps from the outer caps due to the polish leaking, they&#x27;re stuck inside.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 13 year old daughter who loves to paint and design her own nails. She absolutely loved it. I&#x27;ll probably order more.</li>
    <li> Perfect for dotting your nails (or wine glasses)</li>
    <li> I purchased these for doing my own pedicures and nail designs.  They were even nicer than I anticipated, a really pleasant surprise!  So glad I ignored some of the negative reviews and ordered, because I was thrilled with the items and amazed at the value.  I will definitely purchase again without hesitation.</li>
    <li> Some of these colors are good and opaque but a few of them are transparent and what use is transparent polish when using it for nail art? The pen tips work great but I don&#x27;t love the brushes.They aren&#x27;t thin enough to be striping brushes and aren&#x27;t thick enough for anything else. Also the bristles aren&#x27;t all the same length.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re great pens, good control. They come with a needle so that the top will never block up and they come in very bright colors. I recommend them. Their only downfall is that they take a white to dry on the nail.</li>
    <li> love the colors. great pin point tip and brush tip. easy to use just takes alittle practice.</li>
    <li> Bought these as a Christmas gift for my daughter. She used them before lunch on Christmas. She says that they are really cool and likes to use them. Yay!</li>
    <li> These are fabulous if you want to do nail art but don&#x27;t want to pay the expensive prices for the other brand (we&#x27;ve all seen them on tv, i&#x27;m certain).  The base is sturdy and holds the pen upright while you unscrew the cap if you want to use the brush to paint your nails, or you can pull the top off and lightly squeeze the pen to draw wonderful and intricate designs on your nails.  I love these and plan to order more when I need to resupply.</li>
    <li> I love these nail art pens, they are great for doing nail art, they actually work well and ship fast.</li>
    <li> First they are not pens but regular nail polish... Second... One of them busted and was all over thr remaining.  This was supposed be a gift... And i could not use it... The nail polishes were not in good condition... Some were dry as well... I would not recommend</li>
    <li> The colors are great and very pigmented, the packaging is ok. There are a few flaws 1) the brushes are hard/stiff so not able to do much &amp;#34;art&amp;#34; 2) a few of the plastic tubes have holes in them :/ so the product leaks.</li>
    <li> I did not recieve the right item I had purchased. Nor was aloud to return them or get any type of compensation for them, and the items I revived which I had not purchased were broken and was all over the place. I am not pleased.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girls (which in all fairness- I didnt look at any age suggestion). I recieved them a couple days later than it said. They came all bunched together in a bag that was wrinkly and wet. The nail art pen caps wouldn&#x27;t come off and the paint was runny and hard to see. The brushes were bent and nasty- All mangled up. I was so disappointed and now I have to give them to my girls for christmas which SUCKS, because they are NON REFUNDABLE!!! I am really mad.</li>
    <li> these nail pens are so easy to use and they make many different nail designs.i would recommend them for anyone who likes to do their own nails at home.</li>
    <li> They arrived in excellent condition with a brush and fine tip.  They are very easy to use with minimal mess!</li>
    <li> I bought this set for my daughter-in-law and she loves them.  The colors are very vivid and the thin brushes make it easy to create great designs.</li>
    <li> I loveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee these things!!!!!!!! I use them like 2 times every week I learned new designs to do and other people ask me to do their nails now! They are really easy to use and fun to have! Only bad part is the little red needle inside the top part that you have to stick back in every time</li>
    <li> The product is just as stated. Fast delivery.  Havev used it a few times and it works great.  They were clogged, but I used bedding wire to fix it.  Amazing!</li>
    <li> I love this set!! There are great colors and a great selection of paints. We have been practicing to make perfect lines.</li>
    <li> Happy with this order which we expected !!!</li>
    <li> This nail art pen is okay to use.  At the tip, where the color come out sometimes get stuck and you have to squeeze for a long time to use it.</li>
    <li> THese are actually very helpful. I also use the -15pcs Nail Art Gel Design Pen Painting Polish Brush Dotting Drawing Tool. These are two of my favorite items.</li>
    <li> I guess mine came after some of the complaints were written and I believe the mfg. listened.  It arrived in a nice size cardboard box with bubble  tubes to prevent the boxes from moving.  I received 2 very nice boxes that were nicely decorated and had cellouse window on the front. Each box had 6 tubes in the that fit very well in a plastic tray.  The tubes do have a base for standing them upright.  No instructions however.  1 tube did have less paint than the others.. I opened the plastic cap and removed the orange cap that held a very fine pin that goes into the hole at the top. The hole is very fine so that you can make fine lines.  If it were bigger you might not get the fine lines.  Gently squeeze  and some paint will come out and you can do your thing.  Then wipe off any excess and reinsert the pin. I do admit it can be a challenge as it is very fine, but if you do it in good light, it should be not problem.&lt;br /&gt;I did not find the brush terrible.  It was fine and the polish is opaque, so 1 coat will do.  It did dry fast.  I really like the colors , a greater selection would be nice to add to it, but this is fine for your basics, plus a gold and silver metallic.  The price was very good also.&lt;br /&gt;While I am an Esthetician and was licensed to do manicures as well, I only do them for myself and have fun playing around with what is out there.  I expect to have fun with these.</li>
    <li> This product sucks. I ordered it a whole month and 2 weeks ago. It won&#x27;t even let me send it back. The pens were packed terribly. Some or the pens were dried out. PERSONALLY I THINK THAT EMORI KNEW THAT THIS PRODUCT WAS GONNA SUCK! THATS WHY THEY SAID NO RETURNS OR REFUNDS!!! NEVER BUY THIS TERRIBLE PRODUCT. UGHHHHH</li>
    <li> perfect for doing nail designs.</li>
    <li> My daughter has been wanting some of these for awhile.  The paints are great, but it&#x27;s harder than it seems.  There is a tiny wire that has to go inside the tip to keep it from clogging when you close it.  It can be time consuming to get it in.</li>
    <li> Smells to strong but good colors</li>
    <li> work just fine. nice sharp point however the pink is to light wont really work. and some are stuck that the point wont work tried sticking a needle in to clear the way but the whole is to small the needle wont fit</li>
    <li> I HAVE BEEN LOOKING 4 A PRODUCT LIKE THIS 4 EVER.. AT 1ST I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST POLISH WHEN I OPENED IT, BUT LATER FOUND THE PEN PORTION..THEY ARE GREAT AND ESSY TO USE!!..TY</li>
    <li> just perfect might buy more soon</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t really got to totally put them to use yet but when I get sometime to myself and not as busy I surely will. However, I did tried most and I thought they were great. I was actually excited when they arrived yesterday.</li>
    <li> 4 items were leaking and damaged. Didn&#x27;t mintion prefered to be used on artifitial nails.&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> these items came tossed in a mailing envelope in no good order, with the tops falling off and in general disarray. some of the colors appear to be old and sticky - and were too sticky to use. additionally - the colors in the picture were not the colors we received. there was not a rainbow of colors but instead lots of browns and coppers not shown here that we did not want. i would not buy this item again.</li>
    <li> ok so I got these because I do my nails about 3x a week myself and I needed some more colors, well I got exactly what I wanted an awesome set of nail art polishes, they are great, vibrant, and easy to use. love the envelope they came in, no plastic or giant box just a simple padded envelope sweet. only problem was that 2 out of the 12 had a little bit of a spill but it was contained to the top cap only but they work just fine.</li>
    <li> These were a nice concept but the product is not that easy to use. The color does not come out very easy and then when it does it seems to want to blob out. I wish it was easier to control how much color comes out.</li>
    <li> I was iffy about the reviews but then when I received it only 4 of them worked through the pen. But other than that the brush works well.</li>
    <li> I ordered my wife these as a gift because she love to do nail art, but she was highly dis-satisfied with this product. She only got to use the product twice and it started to clump already! Will never use this product again, nor recommend it to anyone, horrible!!</li>
    <li> Some came with damage</li>
    <li> I really loved this product it was easy to use and it came really quickly I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t listen to the negative reviews</li>
    <li> It came exactly as described. I am extremely happy with this purchase and would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> Great to  do nails and easy to use! Price is a real bargain! Don&#x27;t miss out on this deal! My niece loved them!</li>
    <li> These pens are so great...I&#x27;m opening up my own beauty salon and having these pens are so handy when trying to do designs because it&#x27;s quick and not messy...it is however tedious trying to get the needle back in the tip but once you get the hang of it you&#x27;re good to go...and while it&#x27;s true they didn&#x27;t come in any kind of packaging, they were still worth it...the size is bigger than the picture and they&#x27;re great...arrived before schedule too...will definitely be ordering more when I need them...</li>
    <li> i liked the product but one bottle came empty and the dark green and black came popped. aside from the horrible shipping condition the product was good.</li>
    <li> The design can be improved. There is a cap you pop off, then a pin you pull out of a at the top  that dispenses the polish from the needle size hole. Gently squeezing the tube, the polish comes out the needle size hole for making your dots,flowers,etc. Put back the needle and the top, unscrew the main cap and you have your striping brush. The  brush is a  good size length for your striping needs. The bottom of these tube/bottles  are round, and wide so they stand up, which prevents any leaking.  The  colors of these polishes are bright, the polish is not thinned out or runny, like some inexpensive polishes usually are. These paints are on the thicker side,a bit thicker then regular polish,yet thinner then acrylic paints someone would use on nail art designs. The polishes didn&#x27;t come in any sort of box or package for presentation or gifting, so one might have to get creative if gifting these to anyone. They did arrive individually wrapped in bubble wrap, and all taped together then packed in a bubble envelope. None came to me damaged or leaking or dried out.  I just really believe the design of the bottle could have been better, or even a better quality material for the bottles used. I would probably order these again if I can&#x27;t find something better .</li>
    <li> I had a few issues with this product from the start. One of the pens I got was faulty and had been clogged before it was opened. I wrote to the company and they sent me new ones, however the original products had all clogged up and were unusable. I wrote to them again and I received brand new pens, they al work and have never gotten clogged. You MUST keep the pins they come in otherwise they will clog and will be unusable after one use. overall the service was amazing and the colors are very pretty and last a very long time.</li>
    <li> THESE... ANOTHER *MUST* HAVE*.... THEY WORK GRRRREAT... LUV THESE... THEY&#x27;RE FUN.. EASY TO USE MULTI SIDED NAIL PENS.... I THOUGHT THEY&#x27;D BE HARD TO HOLD.. PAINT.. DESIGN.. BUTNO... THEY&#x27;RE AWWWESOME... THANX GOD BLESS</li>
    <li> OK, the product came in an evelope, just thrown in there, some tops weren&#x27;t all the way on.&lt;br /&gt;Colors are great.  the ones that I have gotten to work are nice with the two options, small tip and brush.&lt;br /&gt;Some didn&#x27;t work in the small tip area - clogged or something, I couldn&#x27;t find a needle that small to try and clear it.&lt;br /&gt;Squeeze bottle is nice.&lt;br /&gt;polish is a little thin and did run a little in some of the designs I was trying to create.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping is OUTRAGEOUS!  I assume they charge so little for the item and recoupe the costs in shipping.</li>
    <li> The brushes are all horrible quality, the colors are barely opaque, and the tops dont stay on. i regret buying this, honestly. many colors are glittery. i dont remember seeing more than 2 glittery ones in the picture, but then again, the pic is nothing like the products i recieved</li>
    <li> They are really good and relatively easy to use, there&#x27;s the option for the fine tip pen or the brush which I didn&#x27;t realize until I got them and started playing with them. As I mentioned in another review for the nail brush/tool set, a short tutorial pamphlet with ideas and tips would be really valuable. I can look at pictures all day and not see how something&#x27;s done but a step by step process in pictures, even 3-5 ideas, would be wonderful. My only other drawback would be the fine wire tip plug so that the pen part doesn&#x27;t clog, DO NOT lose it or push it out of shape, you&#x27;ll never be able to find something that thin to unplug the hole.</li>
    <li> My daughter enjoys the set and it arrived in a very timely manner but don&#x27;t discard the orange lids that come on them because the white lids do not stay on as well.</li>
    <li> got this item for my subteen granddaughter.  Very good polish and easy to use.  Good Price for the number of Pens that you get.</li>
    <li> Perfect just what we ordered.  Great shipping time, and good price for product.</li>
    <li> Very good and fast&lt;br /&gt;A Z E R T Y Y U I F D S S Q X V</li>
    <li> the shipping was good, it got here in pretty good time, i was so excited when i got them! they came in a padded envelope. I guess before shipping they didn&#x27;t close one of the tops of the pens and it leaked a little, it only got on one other pen so i wasn&#x27;t upset. as for quality, they&#x27;re not bad, I&#x27;m sure theres better but for what i like to do its pretty good. i find that the polish comes out a little too quickly but you can learn to adjust. other then putting the cap back on (thats a task in itself) theyre pretty good.</li>
    <li> I have used several colors already and they work pretty good. Some of them had dried product on the edge when I opened the cap, not sure what happened. One color won&#x27;t squeeze out. The colors that work are great for small details and dots.</li>
    <li> If your like me and do your own nail this is the best to help you with your nail art designs it has two different tools a thin brush for lines and a lil dotting pointer to help with lil details .It works good and doesn&#x27;t dry out recommend to anyone who does nail.</li>
    <li> Not a very thick polish. The tip is a thin tube and like a white out pen tip... A lil cheap. Alright for the price. but shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> I really love the white, black and silver but the other colors don&#x27;t show up vibrant. The white one did not come out of the tip Idk why but it won&#x27;t. They do get a little sticky but if you just close it and gently rub it between your hands it will be fine.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with this product. Thought it was a great deal for the price. Some of the colors show up brighter than others, like the green doesn&#x27;t pop like it looks and like other colors too. It needs a couple of strokes to show up well. One of the bottles had a small leak so it was hard to open...other than that I really can&#x27;t complain for what it is and for the price. I have used them several times already and am very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Some of them get broken.They come in a envelope all together and 4 of them get spilled inside the envelope</li>
    <li> The product itself may be OK, but I wasn&#x27;t given the chance to really find out. I thought this would be fun for my daughter and I. Unfortunately, the shipping was a joke. They were all singly dumped into a padded envelope, and when they arrived here, most the lids were off and the polish was dried all over the sides of the pens. The ones that had not leaked were nearly impossible to open due to the dried polish around the edges. So disappointed.</li>
    <li> this makes wonderful designs the brushes could be better tho</li>
    <li> Everything was on time and in perfect conditions I&#x27;m very satisfied no issues. I love this product I use it so much I must reorder soon.. I recommended this to several friends and family members.</li>
    <li> so I&#x27;m not using them myself. But I was a little upset because they didn&#x27;t come in any kind of packaging, they were just thrown in the envelope and one of them opened and spilled all over.</li>
    <li> The product is great and easy to useüëç</li>
    <li> This is really my first time playing with the pens and at first for me it was a little tricky to get used too.  But once I got the hang of it I love them! I love the colors! When using the pen you have to put the cap back on just right or it wont close securely.</li>
