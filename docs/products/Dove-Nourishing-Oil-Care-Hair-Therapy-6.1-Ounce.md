      <li>I also have been using detanglers on my daughters (and my own!)</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t kid around when I say I&#x27;ve tried everything top-rated, my fiance considers my search for successful hair products to be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I never wrote reviews  on Amazon, but this product I think I need to write something because it is so good to me</li>
      <li>it smells really good</li>
      <li>This hair therapy is great with a nice smell.</li>
      <li>it is really good.</li>
      <li>very strong scent but is a great detangler  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
      <li>Then this product misted so perfectly evenly over my hair, and is so light, I was amazed before I even drug a brush through it, which was also pleasantly easy.</li>
      <li>THIS HAIR OIL HAS A NICE SCENT</li>
      <li>Thanks for the great reviews!!</li>
      <li>I liked the shine it gave my hair, but by the afternoon, my head looked a bit too oily.  </li>
      <li>It kind of smells like cough syrup, but you get used to it</li>
      <li>Thanks for the great reviews!!</li>
      <li>Also, the scent is light but very nice.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also very easy to use.</li>
      <li>but if you&#x27;re lucking for something more durable and effective try something else.</li>
      <li>It was inexpensive, smelled nice and worked ok.</li>
      <li>so I am happy to use this in rotation (I am mostly &amp;#34;cone free&amp;#34; )</li>
      <li>Gotta love the softnedd of my hair.</li>
      <li>I just love this product.</li>
      <li>I have been using it in my hair every time I get out of the shower and before blow drying and one bottle has lasted me for many, many months to the point where I should check if it expires.</li>
      <li>Ive never used a better detangler.  </li>
      <li>I love Dove products.</li>
      <li>My favorite detangler.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>AND IS ONE OF THE BETTER HAIR PRODUCTS.</li>
      <li>Makes hair very easy to brush and smooth.</li>
      <li>If your hair gets tangled easily, there are better products on the market.</li>
      <li>At first it was amazing, it left my hair silky and manageable,  and not oily at all, just with the perfect shine, I think the formula changed.</li>
      <li>It smells so good, it detangles hair great, so much less pain in that department :).</li>
      <li>and it leaves it smooth and soft with a great scent</li>
      <li>, I agree it smells strongly of something</li>
      <li>I have fine, barely wavy hair and it works great for me as well.</li>
      <li>can&#x27;t find it anymore, did fine one simular by L&#x27;Oreal at Target.</li>
      <li>It makes your hair shine, so beautifully, so soft, so healthy! :)</li>
      <li>So fabulous that it was discontinued.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light feel works well as a leave-in conditioner or before blow-drying (which I do often).</li>
      <li>It makes my hair soft and tangle free with a gorgeous shine.  </li>
      <li>First, see that layer of oil on the top?</li>
      <li>I recommend this trio more than any product I have ever reviewed on amazon, or purchased in general for hair.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in love.</li>
      <li>: I like how this makes my hair feel -- nice and soft, detangled, and it gives my hair some shine.</li>
      <li>It came quickly too.</li>
      <li>, now Im super exicted to go and try it tonight.</li>
      <li>So, this might be a better product if that top layer could be shaken in, but my rating is based on actual use, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
      <li>, it make my hair soft and smooth!</li>
      <li>I use it right when I get out of the shower.</li>
      <li>The shampoo and conditioner left my hair feeling light as a feather, and smooth.</li>
      <li>HOWEVER, when my hair is straight this product is a godsend!</li>
      <li>Bought it first at the store, couldn&#x27;t find it anymore and got it online.</li>
      <li>The real test came when I blew-dry, and straightened it.. and it held up!</li>
      <li>A few sprays after blow drying to shine hair up and make it look good.</li>
      <li>Love the smell and does not leave my hair flat or greasy</li>
      <li>After using this product daily for almost a month, I have come to the conclusion that this product works significantly better on straight hair than on wavy, curly, or frizzy hair.</li>
      <li>When used on dry hair, it made my daughter&#x27;s fine hair look greasy as all get out!</li>
      <li>It smells nice but is not a powerful detangler, even for the tamest of hairs.</li>
      <li>Just a few sprays massage it through your hair and style as u wish I love it!</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use it as a leave-in on wet hair, but when you&#x27;re hair is dry and needs some extra care, this is perfect.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s especially nice for second day hair when your dry shampoo has fixed the roots and left the ends a bit too</li>
      <li>or maybe my hair is the very tangly type</li>
      <li>but I didn&#x27;t find this product much help with that.</li>
      <li>It works better when hair is wet in my opinion.</li>
      <li>That said, it works SO well on straight hair that I still need to give it five stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>but this is really over priced</li>
      <li>And didn&#x27;t really like the smell</li>
      <li>I used to swear by Pantene, which also works really well, but tends to make my hair look greasy.</li>
      <li>It is just light enough to nourish without feeling crispy or oily.  </li>
      <li>but this product doesn&#x27;t detangle very well.  </li>
      <li>I have very oily hair</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t use too much otherwise your hair will look greasy.</li>
      <li>I expected more from this product it didnt do nothing for my hair.</li>
      <li>Otherwise it doesn&#x27;t really make a difference in my hair.</li>
      <li>I bought this product because I&#x27;ve been hearing so much about using oils in your hair to make it healthier.</li>
      <li>Did not like it at all, made my hair very sticky even though I sparingly used.</li>
      <li>I use it everyday as a kind of detangler and to keep my color-treated ends moisturized.</li>
      <li>Really worked for my frizzy hair, much better than other products out there and affordable.</li>
      <li>Probably great for those with only minor frizz or flyaways and coarse hair that is straight to wavy though.</li>
      <li>would highly recommend this product to anyone with straight hair or anyone who ever straightens their hair.</li>
      <li>I also use it on my dry hair to smooth the fly-aways and to make my hair shiny.</li>
      <li>EFFECT.IT IS A REALLY DECENT SIZE</li>
      <li>Applying it to a boar brush makes for more even application, although it&#x27;s only relatively foolproof method in that the effect will still vary by hair texture, etc.  </li>
      <li>I can highly recommend this product and the seller.&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
      <li>BUT IT NEEDS A LITTLE MORE OIL IN IT.</li>
      <li>have naturally very wavy almost curly hair, and when I leave my hair natural or curl it, this product does almost nothing.</li>
      <li>I love how long this product seems to last.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a great product. I have long thick color treated hair and it helps smooth it out without the weight of an oil however it is not a detangler and isn&#x27;t even close to a replacement for Moroccan oil or any other product like that. I use it on my hair after flat ironing it and it leaves it smooth and soft with a great scent however I will not stop using or buying my Moroccan oil~</li>
    <li> This not only gives my hair needed moisture, it really makes my hair shine.  And since it is in a spritz bottle it seems to be lasting forever.</li>
    <li> This is a great detangler! I used to swear by Pantene, which also works really well, but tends to make my hair look greasy. While this detangler looks really oily it is actually pretty difficult to use too much, which is nice because when you accidentally squirt a whole bunch in ine small spot it doesn&#x27;t look terrible. The one thing I don&#x27;t like about this product is the scent. It kind of smells like cough syrup, but you get used to it and it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
    <li> I use it everyday as a kind of detangler and to keep my color-treated ends moisturized.Works great without leaving my hair oily.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It is just light enough to nourish without feeling crispy or oily.  However, I have found it cheaper at other places.  Too bad.</li>
    <li> absolutely love this product -- too bad it is getting so hard to find (discontinued????)</li>
    <li> My teenage daughter has long, thick, very curly hair. I originally bought this for her to help with detangling and keeping down frizz. It works really well for her on both counts and doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy or oily feel. I have fine, barely wavy hair and it works great for me as well. It&#x27;s light feel works well as a leave-in conditioner or before blow-drying (which I do often). Doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair or make it feel greasy. We both prefer this to the argon oil products that need to be put on the hands and worked into your hair. Also, the scent is light but very nice. I will be buying this again!</li>
    <li> I thought I was buying something else. This is a oil/water mix spray. Not what I wanted / needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product works &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; but has been relegated to B-team shelf in my beauty product closet.</li>
    <li> After using this product daily for almost a month, I have come to the conclusion that this product works significantly better on straight hair than on wavy, curly, or frizzy hair. That said, it works SO well on straight hair that I still need to give it five stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally very wavy almost curly hair, and when I leave my hair natural or curl it, this product does almost nothing. It does NOT tame flyaways or reduce frizz. It is like misting water on my hair. HOWEVER, when my hair is straight this product is a godsend! It makes my hair immediately and noticeably shinier. There is a clear difference when I use it and when I don&#x27;t. I cannot sing it&#x27;s praises enough... when my hair is straight!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product to anyone with straight hair or anyone who ever straightens their hair.</li>
    <li> makes hair more knotted than before..smells bad too...makes hair hard and brittle..would not recommend buying this product at all .</li>
    <li> I expected more from this product it didnt do nothing for my hair. The smell is a little weird at first but eventually u get used to it.</li>
    <li> I have waist-long, thick (it takes three hours to put highlights in my hair) red-blonde hair (its not currently color treated). Its coarse, its dry, its brittle after straightening, it frizzes after blow-drying, and it falls out constantly when I drag a brush through it. The ends always look broken, there is no volume to be found, and little to no shine ever. You can see my nightmare. I don&#x27;t kid around when I say I&#x27;ve tried everything top-rated, my fiance considers my search for successful hair products to be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;I was in Target in the DVD section when a music video by Saleena Gomez came on, and I though to myself \\&quot;that hair...\\&quot; So I pulled out my phone and googled what brand of hair products she was known to use, and the results came up as Dove. So I purchased the Daily moisture damage control shampoo and conditioner, along with this little bottle of gold.&lt;br /&gt;And I have no words.&lt;br /&gt;I think my search is over. The shampoo and conditioner left my hair feeling light as a feather, and smooth. Then this product misted so perfectly evenly over my hair, and is so light, I was amazed before I even drug a brush through it, which was also pleasantly easy. Some reviews talk about the scent of alcohol in it, I agree it smells strongly of something (it&#x27;s not unpleasant), but whatever is in this little plastic bottle WORKS. The real test came when I blew-dry, and straightened it.. and it held up! The shine, it&#x27;s still soft, my ends even look and feel healthier. And it BOUNCES! My hair isn&#x27;t greasy by the evening, and there&#x27;s no after smell. I recommend this trio more than any product I have ever reviewed on amazon, or purchased in general for hair.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in love. Thank you, DOVE &lt;3</li>
    <li> If they ever stop making this, I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll do. With my curly hair, it is so hard to get a comb through when I wet it in the morning. This is the only product I&#x27;ve found that makes the comb just glide right through. I&#x27;ve tried all the other oils out there right now, and none do for my hair what this one does.</li>
    <li> Did not like it at all, made my hair very sticky even though I sparingly used. Will not buy again</li>
    <li> Really worked for my frizzy hair, much better than other products out there and affordable. Got people asking me what I was doing different.</li>
    <li> THIS HAIR OIL HAS A NICE SCENT BUT IT NEEDS A LITTLE MORE OIL IN IT. YOU NEED TO SPRAY QUITE A BIT TO GET AN EFFECT.IT IS A REALLY DECENT SIZE AND IS ONE OF THE BETTER HAIR PRODUCTS.</li>
    <li> I never wrote reviews  on Amazon, but this product I think I need to write something because it is so good to me, it make my hair soft and smooth! I feel wonderful on it!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  My hair is waist length, and after washing it takes me a while to comb through the tangles.  The Dove Hair Therapy cuts that time by 75%.  I also use it on my dry hair to smooth the fly-aways and to make my hair shiny.</li>
    <li> I like this stuff it smells really good and it makes my hair soft but this is really over priced I was paying  3 or 4 dollars at Target and other store but for some reason  can&#x27;t find it anymore, did fine one simular by L&#x27;Oreal at Target.</li>
    <li> Some days my hair is painfully dry at the ends... usually because I forgot to put a leave-in spray in it before it dried. That&#x27;s where this product comes in. It is light enough to spray (lightly) on dry hair and then brush through. I wouldn&#x27;t use it as a leave-in on wet hair, but when you&#x27;re hair is dry and needs some extra care, this is perfect. It&#x27;s especially nice for second day hair when your dry shampoo has fixed the roots and left the ends a bit too dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a holy grail product, but I&#x27;ll keep using it for now.</li>
    <li> When used on dry hair, it made my daughter&#x27;s fine hair look greasy as all get out! My other daughter has &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; hair and her hair is easier to comb when using this.  My hair is seriously dry and coarse but I didn&#x27;t find this product much help with that. It works better when hair is wet in my opinion. It has a very nice scent. I think if you have &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; hair this would probably work well for you.</li>
    <li> I just love this product. It smells so good, it detangles hair great, so much less pain in that department :). It makes your hair shine, so beautifully, so soft, so healthy! :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright for the price but if you&#x27;re lucking for something more durable and effective try something else. The only thing I like about it is how it comes in a spray bottle. Convenient for everyday use! Otherwise it doesn&#x27;t really make a difference in my hair. Then again, it&#x27;s different for everyone so try it you haven&#x27;t!!</li>
    <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t beat this.  It works VERY well to get out tangles in wet hair.  I like the scent and would order this again.</li>
    <li> Ive been using oils in my hair for years and this one really surprised me.  I also have been using detanglers on my daughters (and my own!) hair for YEARS and never had success with even expensive brands.  A few sprays of this oil and the brush slips through my hair (blonde highlighted, LONG HAIR, very tangly, fine strands but thick overall) and my daughter&#x27;s (fine strands, very thick overall).  Ive never used a better detangler.  My hair is not oily when it dries and it helps my hair from being dry.  Where has this product been all these years!  Very happy to have this.</li>
    <li> My favorite detangler. It makes my hair soft and shiny. Don&#x27;t use too much otherwise your hair will look greasy.</li>
    <li> So fabulous that it was discontinued.</li>
    <li> I love Dove products. This hair therapy is great with a nice smell. I don&#x27;t understand the bad reviews... Don&#x27;t believe them!&lt;br /&gt;Super affordable price! I have dry wavy hair, I&#x27;m using it every day and makes my hair smother. I can highly recommend this product and the seller.&lt;br /&gt;Fast and carefully shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> I have used a lot of oils for detangling my hair but this is the cheapest and best one. I have very oily hair and this doesn&#x27;t leave the hair greasy at all! I just purchased my 4th bottle. I hope they never discontinue it</li>
    <li> Perfect!  Love the product and arrived earlier than expected.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome... I can never find it in the stores. It came quickly too. Gotta love the softnedd of my hair.</li>
    <li> This product is totally deceiving. It is NOT argan oil, it is just a blend of some spritz water and little bit of oil. It smells nice but is not a powerful detangler, even for the tamest of hairs.</li>
    <li> I liked the shine it gave my hair, but by the afternoon, my head looked a bit too oily.  And didn&#x27;t really like the smell</li>
    <li> The only way I can manage my long, thick, curly hair is with this oil treatment. I can&#x27;t even get a brush through it without this spray.</li>
    <li> very strong scent but is a great detangler  kinda looks like oil so you have to shake it so and so</li>
    <li> This does have one silicone but it is one that evaporates off hair so I am happy to use this in rotation (I am mostly &amp;#34;cone free&amp;#34; )&lt;br /&gt;The smell is wonderful.  It makes my hair soft and tangle free with a gorgeous shine.  It also helps with my frizz.&lt;br /&gt;I use this as a finisher.  A few sprays after blow drying to shine hair up and make it look good.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what I am doing wrong or maybe my hair is the very tangly type but this product doesn&#x27;t detangle very well.  I bought it for a trip when I didn&#x27;t want to use my regular products and struggled daily to get my hair in order.  If your hair gets tangled easily, there are better products on the market.</li>
    <li> This product works great on my hair. I bought it to use as a detangler. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> i use it every day for my kids and myself. it is really good. Makes hair very easy to brush and smooth.</li>
    <li> First, see that layer of oil on the top? No matter how much you shake the bottle, you&#x27;re hardly going to get ANY of that into the bulk of the product. Believe me, I&#x27;ve tried. So, this might be a better product if that top layer could be shaken in, but my rating is based on actual use, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I bought this in a store and I&#x27;ve been &amp;#34;trying&amp;#34; to use this up over the past year, and I am finally about halfway through the contents. I have super-fine, loose curly (natural), fairly porous (dyed) hair that normally has no product in it other than something for frizz control (other than conditioning it, I guess), so my review is based on how it performs in absence of any other product. Overall, I would NOT recommend this for anyone with such hair -- dyed/porous, fine, or curly: It easily weighs down fine hair and is difficult distributing evenly without over-applying it somewhere. When properly distributed at an amount that doesn&#x27;t make my hair heavy, limp, or greasy, it only kind of works in controlling frizz -- that is, it works for maybe a few hours before serious frizz is apparent again. When I put up with a bit of heavy look (and curls drop into just a wave), it controls most of the day as long as nothing touches it. Nothing. If something does, the strands get weirdly flyaway -- clumps of several hairs awkwardly separate away like a failed bedhead look -- and stay that way until I smooth them down just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you get this, you should spray it onto a boar&#x27;s hair bristle brush -- NOT nylon/plastic bristles or directly onto your hair (even from a distance) as these will keep the oil almost entirely on the top surface of the hair, giving you a multi-layered effect (think bad toupee on top of your hair effect). Applying it to a boar brush makes for more even application, although it&#x27;s only relatively foolproof method in that the effect will still vary by hair texture, etc.  Probably great for those with only minor frizz or flyaways and coarse hair that is straight to wavy though.</li>
    <li> I love how long this product seems to last. I have been using it in my hair every time I get out of the shower and before blow drying and one bottle has lasted me for many, many months to the point where I should check if it expires. Love the smell and does not leave my hair flat or greasy</li>
    <li> I love this product. Can apply wet or dry. Helps me get the dryness out of my hair.</li>
    <li> I read all your reviews and decided to to ahead and purchase this product. I have had pretty bad luck finding the right detangler for my hair, spent so much money but never got results. The bottle was on sale in my local Walgreens at 2.50$ so I bought it, now Im super exicted to go and try it tonight. Thanks for the great reviews!!</li>
    <li> This and the Dove Nourishing Oil Care Hair Therapy Serum together is great.&lt;br /&gt;try it. Thanks for the great reviews!!</li>
    <li> It works great and smells so good! Just a few sprays massage it through your hair and style as u wish I love it!</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I&#x27;ve been hearing so much about using oils in your hair to make it healthier. I&#x27;m on a pretty tight budget right now, so I didn&#x27;t want to spring for one of the more expensive brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: I like how this makes my hair feel -- nice and soft, detangled, and it gives my hair some shine. It&#x27;s also very easy to use. I use it right when I get out of the shower. I just shake the bottle a few times so that the liquids mix, and then spray a few pumps on my hair. It has a faint smell, which is pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: The product contains alcohol. I know that the alcohol is awful for your hair, and just dries it out. So, I try not to use it every day, with the hope that my hair won&#x27;t get too dried out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I could afford a more expensive oil product without alcohol, I&#x27;d definitely spring for that. But if you&#x27;re like me and on a budget (and thus have a hard time finding hair products without all those ingredients that professionals would forbid (e.g., alcohol, parabens, etc.), go ahead and give this product a try.</li>
    <li> Bought it first at the store, couldn&#x27;t find it anymore and got it online. At first it was amazing, it left my hair silky and manageable,  and not oily at all, just with the perfect shine, I think the formula changed. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Honestly leaves a weird residue in my hair. I ha e curly hair. Even after washing or dry and i spray some of this in my hair if feels gross.</li>
    <li> It was inexpensive, smelled nice and worked ok. I have very long hair and it just didn&#x27;t do enough to moisturize, protect or detangle. I am still looking...</li>
