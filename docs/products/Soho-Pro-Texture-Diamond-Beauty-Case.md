      <li>I love this makeup case.</li>

      <li>so I would get my make up case faster, and I love it.</li>
      <li>roomy love</li>
      <li>its okay...</li>
      <li>Did I mention I love you?</li>
      <li>I needed something functional yet cute to store all of my make-up.</li>
      <li>I gave this as a gift to someone very special.</li>
      <li>Very good deal, especially at this price.</li>
      <li>Nicely made and the price was very reasonable.</li>
      <li>it works just fine</li>
      <li>Its a nice size and seems very sturdy</li>
      <li>I can fit all of my palettes and brushes with no problem.</li>
      <li>This is more of a very sleek and sexy travel cady.</li>
      <li>Other than that it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
      <li>Its a nice size, not too big but just right.</li>
      <li>&amp; no I didn&#x27;t get paid to right that</li>
      <li>This opens out and has just the right amount of room to make an at home first aid kit or a cosmetics kit, whichever you choose.</li>
      <li>I chose to make mine into a first aid kit</li>
      <li>I ended up purchasing a different case that works a lot better.</li>
      <li>Flimsy plastic.&lt;br /&gt;Would be ok for gentle use, would not recommend for makeup artists, or students, who would use this daily.</li>
      <li>The different compartments make it easy to just grab, use, then store.</li>
      <li>To return this item will cost me too much</li>
      <li>The make up box is VERY roomy.</li>
      <li>This case isn&#x27;t metal and isn&#x27;t very sturdy.</li>
      <li>This makeup case is very spacious.</li>
      <li>This beauty case is perfect, because it&#x27;s not too heavy and bulky, and not too flimsy and small.</li>
      <li>Okay, at first I thought this would be a bit small for me since I&#x27;m a makeup junkie.</li>
      <li>and I love how the compartments hold each little thing.</li>
      <li>I was able to save a few dollars and gain brownie points.</li>
      <li>I love how this case locks, but my only complaint is if you decide to lock it you could easily break the locks off, as it&#x27;s not very sturdy.</li>
      <li>I chose this brand because I have a similar one, and really like it.</li>
      <li>I was really excited to receive this box, and I would have kept it except it did not fit all my nail polish.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve looked everywhere for a mature larger makeup case, this was effect and the rice was a bonus!</li>
      <li>Case is enough room for professional make-up stuffs</li>
      <li>I am so disappointed as the exterior is indeed attractive but the quality of it is horrid.</li>
      <li>The first one I ordered was uneven as well as the trays were rickety.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Its a nice size and seems very sturdy</li>
    <li> Its a nice size, not too big but just right. It houses my blended families of all of my make up. This is more of a very sleek and sexy travel cady. I luv it and I think you will also.</li>
    <li> Big enough for make up collect but it&#x27;s look plastic&lt;br /&gt;look professional but too heavy to carry and go outside.&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s good than expecting !</li>
    <li> This opens out and has just the right amount of room to make an at home first aid kit or a cosmetics kit, whichever you choose. I chose to make mine into a first aid kit and I love how the compartments hold each little thing.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mom for Christmas and she loves it!! It fits everything perfectly!! very stylish! will buy another!</li>
    <li> Great makeup case  roomy love it  fits almost everything and I have lots of make up great case love it</li>
    <li> This makeup case is very spacious. I like it because it opens on both sides. Very good deal, especially at this price.</li>
    <li> This was just what I needed to store all of my makeup products in. Nicely made and the price was very reasonable.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend let me use his account so I would get my make up case faster, and I love it. I have a lot of make up and my other case broke from the weight so I needed a non fabric one. This one is perfect! It&#x27;s big and can even hold my big victoia secret make up box. I recommended this to anyone looking at it.</li>
    <li> Flimsy plastic.&lt;br /&gt;Would be ok for gentle use, would not recommend for makeup artists, or students, who would use this daily.</li>
    <li> Compared to other makeup boxes on Amazon (and in store!) I think this is a good price. The make up box is VERY roomy. I can fit all of my palettes and brushes with no problem. I have a fair collection of makeup, keep in mind. The case comes with two keys. The case is sturdy and portable and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with its functionality or maintenance.</li>
    <li> I needed something functional yet cute to store all of my make-up. This beauty case is perfect, because it&#x27;s not too heavy and bulky, and not too flimsy and small. It fits perfectly in my luggage, and it can be stored underneath a bathroom sink or on a closet shelf without getting in the way. I use it to store all of my nail polish, make ups and some vanities. The different compartments make it easy to just grab, use, then store. It&#x27;s perfect for any girl or woman, and you have cute colors to choose from. Perfect gift to girlfriends too!</li>
    <li> Very poor quality, I used this item for the first time tooday to carry some of my nail art supplies, nothing heavy dried flowers, glitter, brush set, as I am a mobile nail technician. This beauty case did not even make it to my client&#x27;s door the handle broke off and as I opened it to remove my supplies the plastic that holds the shelves up broke off on the left side. I am so disappointed as the exterior is indeed attractive but the quality of it is horrid. To return this item will cost me too much so I am stuck with a case with no shelves and no handle and nothing to keep my accessories in.</li>
    <li> Great place to stash and organize all your makeup.&lt;br /&gt;Nicely styled, easy to use. Deeper bottom area is good for storing more but top areas are great for quick-reach items.</li>
    <li> Case is enough room for professional make-up stuffs&lt;br /&gt;Looking good and convenience for caring&lt;br /&gt;The shelfs are little bit weak</li>
    <li> I purchased this makeup box for my wife and she Loved It! I was able to save a few dollars and gain brownie points. thank you all!</li>
    <li> Perfect caboodle for a great price! I&#x27;ve looked everywhere for a mature larger makeup case, this was effect and the rice was a bonus!</li>
    <li> The quality is great. It is holding up to all of the abuse of traveling. Great space on the inside!</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gift to someone very special. I chose this brand because I have a similar one, and really like it. Great organizer.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to receive this box, and I would have kept it except it did not fit all my nail polish.</li>
    <li> I love this makeup case. The deep bottom allows you to store a lot of makeup products. It&#x27;s a great way to keep your makeup organized. I love how this case locks, but my only complaint is if you decide to lock it you could easily break the locks off, as it&#x27;s not very sturdy. Other than that it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> Gave this to my friend and she loved it!</li>
    <li> Great Quality case !I can fit everything in there !</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s bigger than I realized so it&#x27;s perfect for someone who just needs to throw their makeup somewhere. I have plenty of space for my products and it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> My daughter was toting all her stuff to modelling shoots for my granddaughter in plastic bags; she is delighted to have this to get organized.</li>
    <li> the size of the is perfect but.....as soon as I opened it the metal strips fell of!! Its cheaply made and looks better on line than in person! If your using it to just store your makeup its okay... but if your using it for travel it may not be sturdy enough for that!</li>
    <li> Okay, at first I thought this would be a bit small for me since I&#x27;m a makeup junkie. But, I&#x27;m shocked to say, it held EVERYTHING  and I had some room left. The only bad thing is that if it tilts over, some things might get thrown around and put out of place. Other than that, the lock is perfect, the space is perfect, the look is simple and chic, and I love it! Not to mention the sale that was on it was SUPERB!!</li>
    <li> Did I mention I love you? No Soho like really, I love you! &amp; no I didn&#x27;t get paid to right that, I wish I did!</li>
    <li> This case is just &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; if you&#x27;re just storing items, not the best at traveling. This case isn&#x27;t metal and isn&#x27;t very sturdy. The construction/hinges feel like they are going to break. I ended up purchasing a different case that works a lot better. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this case for weekly use, let alone daily use.</li>
    <li> I was not impressed.  The first one I ordered was uneven as well as the trays were rickety.  The box was damaged.  I sent this back and got a new one within a day and half.  The un-evenness was still an issue but bearable.  But the bigger bummer is the fact that the inside fabric was torn with a hole in the bottom.</li>
    <li> not strudy for travel but on the vanity in the bathroom it works just fine the pull out drawers are flimsey</li>
