### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I bought this product for a wedding I was in... and the color was PERFECT!!  </li>
      <li>Great</li>
      <li>This color would be great for fall and stays on great.</li>
      <li>its a great color.</li>
      <li>I will definately be buying more of this product!</li>
      <li>Winning!</li>
      <li>The color is buildable, which is nice.</li>
      <li>I really liked it</li>
      <li>Nice thought.</li>
      <li>so I make sure that I exfoliate before putting on.</li>
      <li>Love the array of colors too.</li>
      <li>The color is nice and muted, which I wanted for work, and it feels smooth going on my lips.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>I really love this color</li>
      <li>but I was hoping for something with more of a brownish tint.</li>
      <li>Will buy more when I run out.</li>
      <li>It is such a great product even the bride wanted to use it!  </li>
      <li>It looks okay</li>
      <li>Very nice but balm stick broke pretty easily</li>
      <li>The seller did a good job of getting it to me on time and that is always appreciated!</li>
      <li>if you like the color i would suggest going 1 or two colors darker as it does not show up well and looks more like you are wearing a light lip gloss or colored chap stick.</li>
      <li>Rub edible oil on your lips to remove easily, like coconut or olive oil.</li>
      <li>I liked this color so much I bought one for my mom also!</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t go on smooth.</li>
      <li>I really like this lipstain, and this one is my favorite color.  </li>
      <li>This is a great way to color your lips if you don&#x27;t like the thick textures of lipstick or gloss.</li>
      <li>This is the first lip stain I bought, and I picked this brand because I had a coupon.</li>
      <li>This is my first lip stain-</li>
      <li>Pretty color, stays on all day.</li>
      <li>stuff is cheap as chips and does what it says it will do, and does not dry out the lips.</li>
      <li>just beware that the balm stick is fragile and may fall off easily.</li>
      <li>good news is that this stain, when properly applied, lasts a long time and is even somewhat visible after eating.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to like the product, the ease of application and no need to reapply often.  </li>
      <li>color is a much lighter, brighter, corally shade than I thought it would be.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery and was just the color I was looking for.</li>
      <li>stain itself dries quickly, which is nice because I don&#x27;t have to wait a long time before applying the balm, which is a great product all by itself.&lt;br /&gt;Not a bad choice, but it is one of the pricier drugstore brands, so it may not be for everyone.</li>
      <li>Application again and again, plus I live in a hot climate so count in the melting</li>
      <li>It does say on a while, but it goes on flat and because there is no moisturizing ingredient, it feels odd-there is no rubbing your lips together to get the right application.</li>
      <li>I just use a small amount to give my lips a healthy looking blush.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so pretty on, however it only wears for about an hour before you need to reapply it.</li>
      <li>am a really busy woman, who does not want to deal with all the extras of lipstick ( stuck on teeth?</li>
      <li>I love this product when purchased local at CVS but online purchase, the stain is dried out or something.</li>
      <li>You DO need to let it dry completely for a few minutes before touching anything to your lips.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was looking for a new, longer lasting lipstick, and tried this lip stain.  </li>
      <li>I tried storing it with the applicator end down, but  unfortunately no difference.</li>
      <li>first one dried out within 2-3 days of using it -</li>

<li> first one dried out within 2-3 days of using it -</li>
<li> It lasts for a long time, and there was still some left even after eating lunch!  </li>
<li> it did not work for long</li>
<li> and you have to let it dry.</li>
<li> This shade may look a little brownish in pictures, but it is actually very red.</li>
<li> not much to complain.</li>
<li> I wanted to like it, but it goes on wet</li>
<li> This is darker than I expected but, I still like it.</li>
<li> I must say that it was about what I expected.</li>
<li> but I&#x27;m a pale, yellow undertoned redhead</li>
<li> not sure if I mixed the lipstain brush with the lip balm when applying -  </li>
<li> The balm is not really worth mentioning, and a bit on the sticky side, and it broke off after a couple weeks of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> its really not worth the money.</li>
<li> The applicator is very dry, and even after rubbing it on, there is very little result.  </li>
<li> but I&#x27;d like to find a slightly darker, less pinky shade.</li>
<li> This is an odd product.</li>
<li> I use it with a gloss over it but not excited about using the product.</li>
<li> It will go on darker with any dead skin</li>
<li> the colour lasts for a few hours.... like the coral colour on my lips.</li>
<li> I tried henna lip dies that last a lot longer, but are difficult to apply with accuracly.  </li>
<li> and I am hard to find lipcolors for.&lt;br</li>
<li> DRIED UP AND WORTHLESS.</li>
<li> I guess it is impossible to make a lipstick that stays on all day...</li>
<li> /&gt;lovely color - too bad</li>
<li> I get sick of reapplying lipsticks</li>

    <li> Doesn&#x27;t go on smooth. Doesn&#x27;t add color on entire lips - it&#x27;s splotchy.</li>
    <li> Great product.&lt;br /&gt;I am a really busy woman, who does not want to deal with all the extras of lipstick ( stuck on teeth? Bleeding into lip lines? Eaten it off unwittingly? Application again and again, plus I live in a hot climate so count in the melting issue.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is cheap as chips and does what it says it will do, and does not dry out the lips. Winning!</li>
    <li> its a great color. but for something thats supposed to last all day....i had to apply it several times. probably close to 6 times throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I have been using this lipstain for years, couldn&#x27;t find it in store so had to order online. This shade may look a little brownish in pictures, but it is actually very red. Pretty color, stays on all day. not much to complain. Will buy more when I run out.</li>
    <li> the colour lasts for a few hours.... like the coral colour on my lips. just beware that the balm stick is fragile and may fall off easily.</li>
    <li> I liked this color so much I bought one for my mom also! Rub edible oil on your lips to remove easily, like coconut or olive oil. I do not use the shine stick balm part of the  lip stain unless i go to a party.</li>
    <li> UNUSABLE. DRIED UP AND WORTHLESS.</li>
    <li> this is supposed to stay on all day...after you eat it seems to come off...I guess it is impossible to make a lipstick that stays on all day...</li>
    <li> Very nice but balm stick broke pretty easily</li>
    <li> This is darker than I expected but, I still like it. My husband likes it too. I used the foundation called buff to give you an idea of my skin tone. I have medium auburn hair. This color would be great for fall and stays on great.</li>
    <li> This is an odd product. I wanted to like it, but it goes on wet and you have to let it dry. It will go on darker with any dead skin so I make sure that I exfoliate before putting on. Who knew, I scrub my face daily and exfoliate once a week so that was a surprise. It does say on a while, but it goes on flat and because there is no moisturizing ingredient, it feels odd-there is no rubbing your lips together to get the right application. I use it with a gloss over it but not excited about using the product. Nice thought.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and was just the color I was looking for. It&#x27;s a &amp;#34;My lips but better&amp;#34; color on me. The only con is that the balm part kept falling out of the tube, but I somehow managed to fix it, so it&#x27;s not a problem anymore ^_^</li>
    <li> I was looking for a new, longer lasting lipstick, and tried this lip stain.  Works like a charm!  It lasts for a long time, and there was still some left even after eating lunch!  Love the array of colors too.</li>
    <li> This product does not do as it says it will. i put it on about 10am, and was reapplying it at 11am because it had faded away. if you like the color i would suggest going 1 or two colors darker as it does not show up well and looks more like you are wearing a light lip gloss or colored chap stick. its really not worth the money.</li>
    <li> I Bought two of these (one from Amazon and one from a local store)&lt;br /&gt;My first one dried out within 2-3 days of using it - I really liked it so I bought a 2nd one from a local store and the same thing happened again!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if I mixed the lipstain brush with the lip balm when applying -  maybe that&#x27;s what caused it, but i will not buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;lovely color - too bad it did not work for long</li>
    <li> This is the first lip stain I bought, and I picked this brand because I had a coupon. I must say that it was about what I expected.

    <li> I really like this lipstain, and this one is my favorite color.  This is a great way to color your lips if you don&#x27;t like the thick textures of lipstick or gloss. I just use a small amount to give my lips a healthy looking blush. It does need to be reapplied sporadically throughout the day, so keep it on you.</li>
    <li> I love this product when purchased local at CVS but online purchase, the stain is dried out or something. I can use the gloss.</li>
    <li> This is my first lip stain- I get sick of reapplying lipsticks but I&#x27;m a pale, yellow undertoned redhead and I am hard to find lipcolors for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good news is that this stain, when properly applied, lasts a long time and is even somewhat visible after eating.
