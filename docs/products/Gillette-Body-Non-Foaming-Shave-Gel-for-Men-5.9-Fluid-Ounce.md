<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> So far doesn&#x27;t really do very  much for me needs  to produce  more lather, its  almost like you havent applied anything.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK, the smell is OK, it&#x27;s gel I mean really what else is there to say about it besides it doesn&#x27;t foam up. It lasts awhile too. Just not what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I use to shave my face and head.  You only need a small amount to shave with. No irritation afterwards</li>
    <li> This product works well for the intended purpose. It is one of several alternatives to shave cream in a can. I use it when travelling when space is a suitcase is at a premium.</li>
    <li> awful don&#x27;t buy it&#x27;s greasy and will mess up your razor blade</li>
    <li> Works as described -- I was suprised to find it does not lather, instead it creates a slick surface for the razor. My only wish is it would contain menthol to be cooling, or that there would be a companion aftershave product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for shaving. Leaves skin super smooth and easy to apply.. Happy Shaving !</li>
    <li> I was very surprised to find skin is allergic to it.</li>
    <li> Works, but gums up your razor!  Back to creating lather with a brush which works so much better.</li>
    <li> I used Nerelco&#x27;s body-groom without this, at first, i had long hairs so it hurt like hell.&lt;br /&gt;Then i applied some of this and it was smooth i never felt so comfortable shaving before, close shave and no irritation whatsoever!</li>
    <li> Works really well.. Slick and smooth and smells good.</li>
    <li> best Gillette product ever!  no need for lathering and the gel provides amazing lubrication.  I hope this is available forever!!!</li>
    <li> stuff is great. allows you to re shave over same spot. just wet your face a little.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaving gel to use all over my body.</li>
    <li> This product is very good and definitely better compared to the shaving cream. The razor slides on the skin and no clots as usually happens with shaving cream or gel.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great and it works very well.  My only complaint is with the scent. It&#x27;s a bit too strong and musky. Not my cup of tea.  I&#x27;d love this in an unscented form.</li>
    <li> For shaving places other than the face, this is much better than shaving cream, leaving a longer lasting and slicker shaving experience. We won&#x27;t go back to shaving cream or soap.</li>
    <li> i got this gel from the brand! I love this gel it goes on smoothly and evenly with no messes! I would recommend this product to all my friends</li>
    <li> This shave gel is the best for shaving body areas, since it&#x27;s non foaming the gel doesn&#x27;t leave a foamy mess in the shower, the scent is also very good it&#x27;s subtle but still is noticeable</li>
    <li> I received a Gillette Body Men&#x27;s Shave Gel and a Gillette Body Razor from Gillette to give it a try. Once I tried the shaving gel I absolutely loved it. It is perfect because it&#x27;s clear and it lets you see exactly were you are shaving without a problem. The smell is amazing. The Gillette Body Men&#x27;s Shave Gel left my skin feeling like new and by using the Body Razor it gave me the maximum experience. Once you try these two products together, it won&#x27;t ever cross your mind to change to another brand. I recommend it to everybody!</li>
    <li> Normally i try not to buy things like this due to having very sensitive skin but i didnt have that problem with this product and it smells great!! My fiance was all over me!</li>
    <li> A smooth as silk feeling!! I will buy more!!!</li>
    <li> This shave gel makes shaving or trimming &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34; much easier than gels made for faces.  It lubricates so well, that your razor just slides along.  Your boys will appreciate it.</li>
    <li> I was given a chance to try Gillette Body Shave Gel along side the Gillette Body Razor and together they are a manscapers best friend. Absolutely silky smooth shave without any dreaded irritation. But, the best part is that it doesn&#x27;t leave any slimy or oily residue and it easily washes off. My only complaint would be about the scent; its just the usual shaving cream smell and not something special, as I thought it would be--seeing as its used in the shower.</li>
    <li> I was given the opportunity to try this for free from Gillette and I thought the Men&#x27;s body shaving gel was great. The fact that its non foaming enhances the product I feel. Usually, I  have to be a little extra careful since I can&#x27;t see through the foam of ordinary shave cream, but with this I could shave confidently without having to worry. It provided a great amount of lubrication for the razor to just glide through without leaving any irritation. It smells really nice also! My wife was a big fan!</li>
    <li> I received Gillette Gel and the Razor from Gillette and i must say that they are the bff of shaving. The gel is clear which allows you to see the effectiveness of the razor which I really enjoyed. Have recommended this item and will continued</li>
    <li> The Gillette body shave gel is a great product. Super slick, and it smells awesome. Highly recommended for manscaping, not for use on your face. Great buy.</li>
    <li> not good- no different than any other shaving product and the razor is also lousy. Very misleading expecially on the picture advertisements</li>
    <li> Thanks Gillette for the opportunity to examine your new product, the &amp;#34;Gillette Body Shaving Gell.&amp;#34; Initial impressions of the product immediately point to its great smell, this stuff is manly! This is a great lubricant, however I am very used to foam so the gel really didn&#x27;t do it for me. I am hoping with time I will come to further enjoy it because it really feels like a quality product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good shower gel that I need to to become acquainted with. Thanks again,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Floyd</li>
    <li> Great product! ideal for body shaving needs. Works really well with the automatic body shavers like the Philips Norelco BG2040/34 Bodygroom 7100. They provide a much smoother finish &amp; no irritation / itching  after the shaving is done.</li>
    <li> I love the Gillette Body Shaving Gel that was sent to me by Gillette! I have tried other gels that have left my skin dry afterwards or even gave me razor burn from not properly lubricating my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor glided over my skin perfectly thanks to Gillette Shaving Gel! I won&#x27;t be buying any more shaving gels or creams. You need to try this for yourself, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I recently was lucky enough to get a great sample of Gillette Men&#x27;s Body Shaving Gel from Gillette and it works great.  I have to keep my hair short for my job, so I have to shave the back of my neck. I also like to keep my upper back hair free. This gel was fantastic.  No more irritation or redness.  This is a weekly process for me and the Gillette Body Gel is a really wonderful product.  Smooth skin with no redness or irritation.  This product is a total win for me.</li>
    <li> Got it free from the brand. Comes on smoothly. Smells awesome. Skin feels great after shaving. Deffinately a keeper !</li>
    <li> So I used to use plain old Barbasol with Aloe, which seemed to work great... until I tried out a free trial of Gillette Body Gel from Gillette. The gel makes shaving a breeze, allowing you to see exactly what you are doing and not gooping up like shaving cream does. It just lathers onto the skin and provides a super slick surface for the razor to glide across. The only problem I had, was that it made it more difficult to hold on to the razor - which I think I&#x27;ll get used to after a few more uses.</li>
    <li> Received this product from Gillette to try. I normally use shaving cream that slides off my back, and is hard to apply. This product stays put on your body and provides good lubrication for the body razor. My wife also loved the smell of the body shave gel!</li>
    <li> I received this product free from Gillette. I was a bit skeptical at first, due to a past product I used I wasn&#x27;t happy with.  I put some on my chest while taking a shower and it made shaving so much easier. It will become my go to for all future body shaving needs. The lather was nice and, it smelled great as well. One you start shave the razor glides effortlessly across the skin making it so much easier to shave. It felt like magic at how easy it was!</li>
    <li> I got Gillette body gel free from Gillette. It worked ok it seemed to me that it dryed up quicker then my normal save cream after it stared drying up it pulled hair so I wouldn&#x27;t buy it</li>
    <li> I have had a positive experience with this shave gel. It is clear and provides great comfort when shaving my &amp;#34;man parts&amp;#34;. I have tried several but Gillette has done a great job in my opinion on this one.</li>
    <li> Before I used the body gel, I was not very optimistic that it would actually stay on while showering; however, it did just that which made it so much easier to get a clean shave without &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; shaving. Plus, being able to actually see the area I was shaving made me more confident that I wouldn&#x27;t be walking around with patches of hair in different areas. Great product.</li>
    <li> So today i tried out Gillette Body Gel, that was given to my by gillett to try out. I threw some on my shoulder while taking a shower and it made shaving so much easier. It will become my go to for all future body shaving needs. The lather was nice and, it smelled great as well. One you start shave the razor glides effortlessly across the skin making it so much easier to shave. It felt like magic at how easy it was.</li>
    <li> In the past I have primarily used creams to shave.  I must admit that I really like this gel.  You can see what you are shaving (as it doesn&#x27;t foam) so there isn&#x27;t as much guessing and reapplying to get all the spots.  The smell is nice and it&#x27;s cooling, my skin feels great after.  The only downside is that my family won&#x27;t keep their hands off of it.  Good thing a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> very good for the intimate parts, no irritation at all, use it with the body razor</li>
    <li> I like how its a gel instead of foam it makes it easier to get a close and smooth shave.  The smell is also appealing not your traditional boring shaving experience</li>
    <li> This was my first time using Gillette Body Gel as it was given to me to try for free from Gillette. The Gel helped moisturize my skin and keep a close shave when used in conjunction with the Gilette Body Razor. The gel did not irritate my skin which I have experienced before with other brands. While I did not care for the scent, I would reccommend the Gel overall for men looking for a close shave while moisturizing the skin at the samet time.</li>
    <li> I received this item as a free sample from Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; i was unsure how this product would feel or work without foaming but it turns out that it seems to go on thicker and makes it to where i can barely feel the razor, i would consider buying this simply for facial shaving too. i cant stand getting irritated when shaving and this seemed to minimize that issue greatly !</li>
    <li> At first i did not think this gel would work very well, but i in the end i couldn&#x27;t have been more incorrect.  This gel helped to give the closest shave i have ever gotten.  It also prevented any type of razor burn or irritation following the shave.  It is thick enough to not wash off prematurely, yet does not gunk the cartridge up with shaving gel.  I plan to use this for all my shaving needs in the future.  I received the gel from the brand as part of a free trial with bzzagent.</li>
    <li> I got this to use with the gillette body razor and it is amazing! So much better and longer lasting than the foam stuff. I used this with my regular razor on my face and neck as well. Huge difference! You don&#x27;t have to worry about going over the same spot twice and getting irritated it keeps your skin moisturized till your done and rinse it off. The gel also smells better than traditional shaving cream which is just a tiny bonus. Very awesome stuff!</li>
    <li> The gel was awesome, it didn&#x27;t lather to a foam but stayed closer to a gel consistency even when rubbed in but I guess thats the point. It is easy to see where you have already shaved and where you need to get still. I have more sensitive skin than the average guy so I can only use certain foams. But can&#x27;t complain, all in all great product. Thanks Gillette.</li>
    <li> I gave this products 5 stars because it worked great, the gel its clear making it easy to see any bumps or scrapes and it leaves your skin feeling soft and hydrated. I would definitely recommend this! thanks to Gillette I got to try it for free.</li>
    <li> Because it lathers easily and when you wash it off if feels like it moisturizes your skin&lt;br /&gt;There is nothing about it I disliked and  I would recommend to friends</li>
    <li> I received this product from Gillette about a month ago, and all I can say is &amp;#34;wow!&amp;#34;. This product works in mysterious ways, I must say. Usually when I use something like this, I tend to get a foam substance. However, this being a gel really surprised me because gels never seemed to work for me in the past. This product, when used, applies very well. It lathers on, and is super slick. Honestly, I think I&#x27;m going to have to start buying this instead of my other product just because of how amazing it feels. After I&#x27;m done, my skin always feels so soft, and smooth. It feels similar to using lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product to anyone in the market for a body gel. While you&#x27;re at it, you should look into Gillette&#x27;s Body Razor, too. The picture on the gel shows you what kind of razor is recommended. It&#x27;s only a couple extra dollars, I think you should enjoy it!</li>
    <li> This is definitely my new favorite body gel. I don&#x27;t ever see myself buying any other kind in the future.</li>
    <li> I received this product for free from Gillett. I was skeptical, but it&#x27;s a huge jump in quality when shaving in the shower compared to shaving creams or gels I&#x27;ve used from aerosol cans.  It gives great lubrication leading to a nice close shave without irritation.  This stuff goes a long way too, you don&#x27;t have to glob in on to get good coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this, I&#x27;ll never go back to shaving cream or gel from an aerosol can when shaving in the shower, but perhaps the most ringing endorsement...  My wife fessed up that she&#x27;s started using this too!</li>
    <li> I recently got the chance to try out the Gillette Body gel through a trial from Gillette. The Gillette Body gel made for a very smooth and refreshing shave.  Unlike some shave gels the Gillette Body gel did not clog up the works of the razor and rinsed easily our between the blades.  In the past products that boast a smooth shave with minimal irritation are a bit to thick and clog up the razor.  There was no such case with the Gillette Body Shave Gel.</li>
    <li> 5 stars for some, 4 for me. I am not a fan of not having foam, while most guys are. That&#x27;s the only reason I was not able to give this 5 stars, I love a good lather. Aside from that, the gel is solid. Leaves you feeling refreshed and smooth with a nice scent.</li>
    <li> I like this gel  a lot. It stays clear, even after you lather it, so it helps to make shaving easier and smoother because you can see where and what you&#x27;re shaving. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and protects against razor burns and snags. I got this from the gillette brand for free to review and i&#x27;m really glad i did. I will definitely keep buying it.</li>
    <li> When I received the Gillette Men&#x27;s Body Shaving Gel (free from Gillette as part of a testing program to try and review), I was skeptical about the gel rather than using my typical foam shaving cream. However, I gave it a chance to prove me wrong. It did not. I felt like I had to use a significant amount of the gel to get coverage and it still did not protect my skin from the razor causing razor burn. After the first time, I used the gel again to see if maybe I just needed to use more but it still did not help. I will not be using this again in the future.</li>
    <li> The product was good. The packaging was quality was poor. The tube was split open at the seam.</li>
    <li> Bought this along with the Gillette  body shave razor. I find that I get a less irritated shave with this clear gel as opposed to regular shaving cream. Goes on easily and has a thicker viscosity that I like. Leaves skin very smooth and no razor burns. I only use it on manscaping areas, not my face. Of  course we all have different body types so your experience may not be the same as mine, but if you&#x27;re looking to experiment with  something new to give yourself a better shave then give it a try. If it doesn&#x27;t work for you then you can always go back to cream. Thanks Gillette for always trying to improve and evolve your products. Best on the market.</li>
    <li> This gel makes for a clean shave. Unlike your typical shaving cream, this gel shaving &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; leaves your skin hydrated.  Would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I liked using the Gilette Body Shaving gel.  Again, I usually use an electric shaver, so I never use shaving gel, but last night I tried the new Body Gel that BzzAgent sent me and it was very creamy when it foamed up, smelled awesome, and left my skin moisturized and soft.  I believe the gel helped in insuring that razor burn wasnt left behind when using the new razor that got a much closer shave than I usually get.  I like this product alot and will continue to use and purchase it.</li>
    <li> Gillette sent this Body Gel to me to try out and I must say it feels like slimmer from ghost busters hit me in the face.  It was good smelling but would not come off.  I am going to stick with my other Gillette Shaving foam.</li>
    <li> Received body gel from Gillette and I think it&#x27;s the perfect product for body shaving and facial shaving. I&#x27;m super Picky about what I shave with because I don&#x27;t want a mess and I want it to be comfortable. I have even attempted trying my wife&#x27;s shaving products but it blows up into big foam and I can&#x27;t see what I&#x27;m doing well enough. I have even tried shaving with conditioner but it was actually too thin. I tried Gillette body gel and It worked perfect. I honestly really like this stuff. No big mess, it didn&#x27;t run and had the perfect consistency to stay in place and make for a smooth shave. Used it on my chest and face. I have to shave often on my face to the less irritation the better. I didn&#x27;t cut myself at all, it was smooth, smelled great (manly of course) and didn&#x27;t use too much to get the job done. One bottle will last me awhile. It is something I would repeatedly purchase and would be my go to gel. I would recommend this to everyone. I like to have a clean shaved chess especially with weight lifting and getting in shape. My hair grows back fast so this is perfect to last me a good amount of time. No foam is the way to go.</li>
    <li> I was given the opportunity to try out this bodyb gel from Gilette for free. This body gel is unlike any shaving product I have used before. When I first squeezed it on to my hand, it noticed the smell right away. It is fresh and makes the whole shower smell great. When I out it on my body it felt rereshingly cool. It felt a little odd because I am used to using shaving cream, but it was not an unpleasant feeling. One thing I really liked was that the gel stays put really well. While I was shaving one area, the gel wasn&#x27;t sliding off another area. It creates a nice layer between my skin and the razor. It washes off easily and leaves my skin soft and smooth. I really enjoyed the body gel experience!</li>
    <li> I gave this product a shot as all things Gillette are pretty great.  Gillette is sort of like the band Lifehouse.  You want to hate them but they just keep bringing the hits.  If you do the manscape thing...after using your clippers on the key areas, this is the product to lube up the nether-region before shaving with a razor.  Your lady will thank you.</li>
    <li> Without any suds this gel allows you to see where you are going. This stuff is slicker than pig snot.</li>
    <li> Works very well at keeping cuts and razor burn off of sensitive areas.  My skin is extremely sensitive, but using the right technique, hardware, and shaving gel, I can avoid nastiness that otherwise accompanies manscaping.  I have tried other shaving creams with certain degrees of success and I purchased this one on a whim.  It works extremely well and is relatively very inexpensive.  I have had it for a while now and am still working off of the same tube - I hardly use any when shaving because not too much is needed to make a nice, slippery lather.  This might not necessarily be the best purchase on the market (I honestly don&#x27;t know because I haven&#x27;t tried all of these types of products available) but this works brilliantly, especially at its price.  I would recommend it to anyone who commits to body shaving.</li>
    <li> Perfect consistency at a good price</li>
    <li> Gel is good, you don&#x27;t need a lot for coverage. However, it doesn&#x27;t stay clear once it&#x27;s worked in, it turns white.&lt;br /&gt;If you do a lot of &amp;#34;edging&amp;#34; work it can be a little difficult.</li>
    <li> So good that in public showers, it is often taken if left.</li>
    <li> I preferred this to the shaving cream I have used in the past. Its very lubricating, which helps with a close shave without any irritation or red bumps. Its also clear which makes it easier to see what I&#x27;m doing when I&#x27;m shaving areas that I haven&#x27;t memorized quite as well as my face. My wife steals it for her legs.</li>
    <li> This gel worked better than shaving cream that I have used in the past. It lathered up nicely and worked well with the Body Razor that was provided. I liked it more than regular shaving gel because it left my skin feeling hydrated rather than dried out like normal shaving cream. I would actually buy this product in stores, full price.</li>
    <li> I like the gel, but I don&#x27;t think its the greatest gel I&#x27;ve used for body shaving.</li>
    <li> I do not usually use shaving gel but Gillette hooked me up for free so I tried it. I was impressed. Makes shaving painless, lubricates for a super smooth shave with its matching razor. Doesn&#x27;t foam up at all.</li>
    <li> Not a huge fan of Gel based shaving creams, but this guy gets the job done. No irritation, pleasant scent. When you&#x27;re shaving &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34; you really don&#x27;t want to take any chances, so go with the safe bet.</li>
    <li> Perfect. Small, but each squirt is more than enough unlike other products of different brands. Soothes the skin, makes it feel like you&#x27;re merely moving the blade. Must have.</li>
    <li> I really just use it on my face....I like it because it&#x27;s a clear gel so you can see where you&#x27;re shaving....and it&#x27;s for sensitive skin...</li>
    <li> This product feels really comfortable and smells great too !</li>
    <li> When I first received my razor from Gillette, I was a little skeptical, as I was used to a razor with more than three blades. This didn&#x27;t turn me off from using it, I was just used to my old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before diving in head first and shaving all over, I performed a test under controlled conditions (as controlled as possible). I first did a body shave with my &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; razor, using a new head and my standard shaving cream. results were as expected, not anything special, just clean shaven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I let my hair grow out again, and this time I used the Gillette Body Razor with Non Foaming Gel. WOW! What a difference. I normally don&#x27;t boast about a smooth Man-scaped area, but this was something different! I felt incredibly smooth and it lasted for almost three days before I got any stubble back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not to be too crazy about controlled conditions, I tried the Gillette razor with my standard shaving cream as a third study. The results weren&#x27;t as exciting as it was with the Non Foaming Gel, Standard OK shave job, same as the control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall experience: I highly recommend getting this razor, but you will definitely have to use the suggested Non Foaming Gel to experience optimal shaving results. Trust me when I say it would be worth it!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any different than the shaving gel that Gillette makes. Companies will sometimes look for an opportunity to increase their sales by taking an existing product and relabeling it as something different. You would think that knowing that information would keep me from falling for prey to purchasing it. The fact that it did not just goes to show how effective the advertising &amp; repacking process was.  3 stars because I like the shaving gel and use it daily. The shaving gel is a 5 star product but I give only 3 stars here due to the \\&quot;deceptive\\&quot; advertising.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried at least ten products designed for shaving body hair.  This is the best product I&#x27;ve tried so far.  Use this with the Gillette men&#x27;s body shaver and it&#x27;s a winning combination.</li>
    <li> Since I trashed the razor I also put this in the trash also.</li>
    <li> Smells good, but that&#x27;s about it. It seems that putting this on, actually made shaving less effective. It seems to make the hair slimy and harder to shave. Razor works better without it.</li>
    <li> Great smell. The fact that it&#x27;s a gel helped leave no nicks and cuts. Even though it&#x27;s a small container a little goes a long way</li>
    <li> great to use for the manscaping.  lathers nicely and makes the shave easy peasy</li>
    <li> product is just like any other shaving gel from Gillette only repackaged to increase cost.</li>
    <li> This is the best thing on the market if you still have to shave like me. It leaves skin hydrated and soft and you don&#x27;t need a lot.  It&#x27;s good for both men and women. Unfortunately, they don&#x27;t have this for women but it&#x27;s ok the gel doesn&#x27;t know the difference. My husband and I both use it.</li>
    <li> Bought this with the razor and I had slices on my bod.&lt;br /&gt;Not too happy with that. Obviously this gel had to affect with the razor.</li>
    <li> Better than shaving cream in shower</li>
    <li> feels just like all their other shaving gels</li>
    <li> I like to use this body shave gel, because you don&#x27;t need to put a lot to shave your body. I start from my legs, good for back and chest... I don&#x27;t have body shave Gillette razors and it still works good. I like that the price here was cheaper than other than other stores.</li>
    <li> It is super excellent indeed done for us not make my skin allergy when using gillette body is excellent this article ... 👍</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t shave my junk with this - save some greenbacks, and use this gel on your face.  It&#x27;s all skin, man.</li>
    <li> I got this as a free sample from Gillette to review along with a razor. this gel is better then the razor it worked well every spot i used it. i don&#x27;t have burn anywhere it doesn&#x27;t foam so you get what you get and it doesn&#x27;t hide what you&#x27;re trying to get rid of. I know it said not made for the face somewhere on the tube but i did and it worked there too who wants to play find the right product for the right spot when you just want to get out the door.</li>
    <li> LOVE this gel! As the title says, it smells great, and it goes on smooth and leaves your skin even smoother. Now, it didn&#x27;t lather or foam for me, it was literally just a gel, but that&#x27;s fine in my opinion. It works fantastic. It says it&#x27;s only for the body, but I used it on my face and neck as well, and experienced a closer, more comfortable shave than with any other foam or gel I&#x27;ve used. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Body Gel was extremely easy to use.  I used the gel to shave the back of my neck and my upper arms.  Both areas went very smoothly with zero irritation the next day which matches the claims of Gillette.  Another plus with this product is a little goes a long way which was surprising because it is non foaming! I would highly reccommend this product to my framily.</li>
    <li> Big thank you to Gillette for the free sample went on smooth smelled great nice clean non irritated shave got lots of attention from the wife plan on buying more when the sample runs dry</li>
    <li> This gel is great, but I recommend buying the whole pack. The Gillette Body Razor and Men&#x27;s Shaving Gel combo is simply the best thing you can do for your body hair. Unlike electric body groomers which tend to irritate the skin and leave cuts in loose skin, the razor in this pack utilizes three perfectly-placed blades for a smooth shave your body will love. The ergonomic design of the razor, with its smooth but strong grip and replaceable moving head, provides more control and a closer shave. The shaving gel completes the &amp;#34;perfect shave&amp;#34; by allowing the razor to glide over skin to leave it so smooth you won&#x27;t be able to tell there was any hair on it in the first place. And it smells awesome!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many different brands of razors and power groomers, but not only do they irritate the skin, they cause rashes once the hair starts growing back. With the Gillette Body Razor and Men&#x27;s Shaving Gel, even the hair grew back smoothly and without causing irritation or rashes.&lt;br /&gt;So unless you enjoy the irritation caused by regular razors or groomers, do yourself a favor and try the Gillette Body pack. Your body will thank you for it.</li>
    <li> i had a chance to try this product for free #gotitfree #bodyready. it dos not foam as regular gels do, i found it weird at first, but after getting used to it, i really liked it. it gives you the cooliong feeling so it does not irritate your skin after shaving. i would recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of shave gel... And I never have been. If that&#x27;s all you&#x27;ve ever used, this product will be great. I have sensitive skin, so I use an appropriate shave cream designed for sensitive skin. However I tried this gel out just for the review. Don&#x27;t get me wrong... It&#x27;s slick. Really slick. But it left my skin feeling dry and I got some irritation while shaving that I&#x27;ve only experienced with gel versus cream. But if gel is your thing, you&#x27;ll probably like it. The smell is fine, smells like a good men&#x27;s body wash. But for me, gel isn&#x27;t the first thing I&#x27;ll reach for.</li>
    <li> I received Gillette&#x27;s Body Gel in the mail about 2 weeks ago and ever since then my skin has been so soft! The lubricants in this gel are phenomenal!! :) Once you run your razor over the gel it just softens your skin instantly. I love the clear blue formula of this gel. It allows you to see your skin in case you have any breakouts or bumps that you need to be careful when shaving over. So, it prevents cuts and nicks very well!! I prefer this any day over any shaving foam... Foam is way to overpowering for a razor and it leaves your face feeling dry. This is the total opposite. When you even lather it on it stays the same consistency and is still clear for you to see where you are shaving!! This is hands down my new favorite gel and I totally recommend it to anyone who wants a GREAT shave!! I will definitely be getting more of this Body Gel for sure!!!! :)</li>
    <li> Really nice product.  I like that it lasts in the shower and doesn&#x27;t get all foamy like a typical gel or shave cream would.</li>
    <li> I started using non-aerosol creams because of the advantages in traveling, and would never switch back.  I have used 3 different non-aerosol shave creams, and consider all 3 good, and all 3 roughly the same price.  This product (Gillette Body) is amazingly slick, almost like shaving with STP, if that&#x27;s any advantage.  It&#x27;s disadvantage is that it&#x27;s difficult to see on your face when shaving in the shower (which I do).  Another product, by Edge, is easily seen on the face, but difficult to empty the tube completely, and the 3rd, Neutrogena, is visible enough, and has no disadvantages, other than that Amazon sells it in packs of 2 tubes.  The latter is my preference.</li>
    <li> Wow this gel smells very good i will buy at the store when i run out its a good size for the price with the Gillette body gel i smell awsome all day and i dont feel irratation</li>
    <li> When I received this free product from Gillette, I must say that this new gel shaving product is a great innovation. While most man is normally used to using foam, it is agreeable that most man would need some time to adapt to this new non-foam body shaving gel. On the other hand, not only does Gillette body shaving gel is used to body shave, but it indeed acts as a bodywash too. I love the aqua blue colorway of the gel, and it has a pleasant Irish springwater minty fresh scent. Overall, its awesome and yes, it is recommend for all man to try it out.</li>
    <li> Received the Body Gel from Gillette and I must say that I am extremely happy with it. The Gillette Gel was the most amazing shaving foam/gel I&#x27;ve ever used. Not only did it last longer it left a great smooth and fresh feeling afterwards. Functioned great while in the shower.</li>
    <li> I like this product, works well with my skin during my shave . Smells good . I would recommend this product. I got this product for free from gilette . Thank you for letting me try it. I enjoyed the feeling and smell from this shaving gel. Does not leave any residue</li>
    <li> I found the Gillette Body Gel to do wonders on my skin. You get a clean shave while not having to mess with all the typical foam. It also smells great but is not super strong either. You also get 175ml in the bottle so it lasts and lasts. I would recommend anyone who shaves regularly in the shower to give this product a try.</li>
    <li> Gillette Body Gel is simply amazing!! I love how it goes on clear and not foamy, you can actually see where you are shaving and it helps to prevent nicks and cuts. The formula is so soft, it feels like you are shaving with aloe!!! After I am done shaving there is no stinging, my skin is not irritated at all instead it feels so rejuvenating. SO cool &amp; fresh afterwards, and such a GREAT smell! After using this stuff I was addicted. This is my one and only shaving gel from here on out! It just allows the razor to glide over wherever you need shaved, leaving your skin SOOO soft. I give this product a 10 out of 10!! Job well done Gillette!! :) Definitely will be buying loads more of this!!!!</li>
    <li> Left a great smooth finish. Got it as a sample from Gillette and couldn&#x27;t be happier. One of the very few shave goes I can use that doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin. I was skeptical but very pleased after the use. Would recommend again!</li>
    <li> The Gillette Body Gel is replacing shaving cream for me. It is truly rare when I find a shaving gel that causes no irritation and leaves my skin feeling truly clean!</li>
    <li> This Gillette Body Gel is amazing, since it doesnt foam I am able to see what and where I am shaving, so there is no need to &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34; any patches. It was a close and very smooth shave, it moisturized my skin and I swear it took longer for my stubble to come back in. I personally liked that it left my skin hydrated and not itchy the way foam usually does while leaving behind a nice scent. It made me feel refreshed and clean. Thank you to Gillette for allowing me to try out this product.</li>
    <li> Gillette body shave gel is amazing it works, it smells good, over all a grate product and I recommend it to all my friends.</li>
    <li> I might have been expecting more for this product.  Its nice, but simply a gel (non foaming) that you apply.  It goes on clear, spreads clear and you shave.  Might be a bit easier if you werent using it in the shower which makes it a bit hard to see where you have shaved, and where you havent.  The gel does work nicely though....just wish it would be more a foam</li>
    <li> I got this as a free sample from Gillette to review along with a razor and this stuff is better then the razor it worked well every spot  used it. i have burn anywhere it doesn&#x27;t foam so you get what you get and it doesn&#x27;t hide what you&#x27;re trying to get rid of. I know it said not made for the face somewhere on the tube but i did and it worked there too who wants to play find the right product for the right spot when you just want to get out the door. the only minor complaint was my wife she said it smelled like everything else i use but that seems like a plus to me. So even if you don&#x27;t like Gillette razors but like shaving gels more then foams then i say try this out might find a new shaving buddy......</li>
    <li> Good for sensitive skin users</li>
    <li> does what its supposed to!</li>
    <li> Really like this shaving gel. Works great and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. Keeps a clean and smooth shave. Washes off good. Will be buying more of this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received from the brand for free in exchange for an honest opinion.</li>
    <li> This gel is great. I&#x27;ve had it for about a month now and I still have some left. Only a small amount will go a long way. It smells awesome. Once I am done with this bottle, I will go out and buy another.</li>
    <li> Perfect for the quick shave and with smooth touch on your skin,barely make you feel of blade as it make lots of foam.I would definitly recommend this for quick shave Gel who like lot of foam.</li>
    <li> The gel has no IRRITATION, And it helps with the shaving alot, That all i need, and its cheap so i could buy more</li>
    <li> Best shave you could ever get!</li>
    <li> Works well with electric dhaver.</li>
    <li> Smells good,just wish it was made more for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> super easy glide technology headed for awesomeness. its as easy as popping the top off and lathering your body with it, you are ready to shave wherever you want!</li>
    <li> I have always been a shaving cream kind of guy so when Gillette sent me this gel I was a little skeptical, but the Gillette Body gel has won me over. The gel was smooth and cool, it helped soothe those sensitive areas. The best thing about it was the fact that I could see through it to the hair allowing for a quicker more precise shave.</li>
    <li> It feels expensive there&#x27;s no other way to put it. It feels like a $60 brand of awesomeness on your face it’s cool and refreshing at the same time. Not sticky, no harsh stinging or burring, &amp; no funky smells. To say that I highly recommended this product is a HUGE understatement by far!!</li>
    <li> Not as good as I had hoped. It&#x27;s not very expensive but I think regular shaving cream works just as well.</li>
    <li> Works great and does not foam</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about trying this shaving gel, other gel products were horrible. This gel is awesome gives me a smooth shave and no irritation.</li>
</ol>
