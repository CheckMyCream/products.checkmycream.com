      <li>* XL size covers up more for modesty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sizes and uses:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>Love everything about them.</li>
      <li>I am glad I got it.</li>
      <li>and I love them.  </li>
      <li>These are sold as &amp;#34;travel towels&amp;#34; but I love them and use them at home.</li>
      <li>I used this towel and was pleased with its absorbency and feel.</li>
      <li>It is great for travel as it takes up about as much space as a folded T-shirt.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love the snap because I can hang them anywhere easily.</li>
      <li>Packs easily also.</li>
      <li>It washes easy and does not hold odor after washing.</li>
      <li>It is as good as new.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It also worked fine as a beach towel.  </li>
      <li>This Aquis Adventure Microfiber Towel is just fine.</li>
      <li>Works great for a pool towel - fits in a gym bag but absorbs like a regular towel.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing how much water this towel blotted up.  </li>
      <li>She called home to tell me how much she liked it.</li>
      <li>The larger size was great for the beach, however.</li>
      <li>- it amazes me how light it is.</li>
      <li>Quick drying, absorbent, durable, easy to wash.  </li>
      <li>* Lisse Crepe -- their original towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>L was the original hair/gym towel size -- longer and narrower.  </li>
      <li>Aquis microfiber is a-1, first rate, top dog, and absorbent, clean and lightweight.</li>
      <li>drys quick, don&#x27;t stink and light.  </li>
      <li>In my experience all microfiber is not the same and not all microfiber is good...</li>
      <li>It dries quickly.  </li>
      <li>Dries quickly.  </li>
      <li>you prefer your own towel to those thread bare, ultra bleached towels the gym provides, skip the cotton bath towel and use the Aquis microfiber instead.</li>
      <li>This is the perfect size for backpacking, as it&#x27;s not too small &amp; it also doesn&#x27;t take up much space.</li>
      <li>I purchased this towel for gym use after an older microfiber towel finally wore out after several years, and after a couple of months of use, it&#x27;s been a very good purchase.  </li>
      <li>Soaks up water quickly and is very compact.</li>
      <li>Very absorbent, dries quickly, rugged quality, yet lightweight.</li>
      <li>The towels dry as quickly as you could hope for in camping and college settings.&lt;br /&gt;:-)</li>
      <li>Although the overall feel of this towel is superb it is not quite what I would describe as cotton soft when rubbed against wet skin.  </li>
      <li>First used it on her training trip.</li>
      <li>I intend to get some more smaller sizes for camping!</li>
      <li>I live in Thailand and find it sweeps the water from your body --- feels soft and gentle and DRIES so quickly!!  </li>
      <li>You might be able to find a better towel, but you&#x27;re going to have to search hard.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s funny, managing this towel has been so easy and convenient, I have yet to use the second ordered.</li>
      <li>Good for a small child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My wife has curly hair, and these dry her hair far better than anything else!</li>
      <li>The limited number of microfiber towels I have used, this is by far my favorite!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s soft, absorbent, and dries quickly.</li>
      <li>Quite a large towel.  </li>
      <li>carry bag it comes in, mesh on one side, is also very well made.</li>
      <li>The picture on my computer screen doesn&#x27;t portray this color accurately but I don&#x27;t much care about the color and figured seafoam would be light green as it is.</li>
      <li>* Feels closest to a real</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be ordering a whole set</li>
      <li>Not the &amp;#34;fluffier&amp;#34; microfiber I&#x27;m used to, but very absorbent.</li>
      <li>* Very absorbent and lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The price may seem daunting, but when you consider the durability, comfort, and features, it&#x27;s a real bargain.</li>
      <li>Its also a great idea for college students and people in apartments with limited space for storage or access to laundry, as said, it is compact, and also quick dry and does not get moldy/smelly as easily as regular towels.  </li>
      <li>It dried quickly and when I used it on the beach, the sand was easily to shake off.</li>
      <li>To fit the towel back in, be sure to fold it in thirds once, not just in half.</li>
      <li>The size is more like a regular bath towel, so extra large is misleading, but for microfiber sport towels it is generous.  </li>
      <li>It is more &#x27;compact&#x27; and the feel is just as good, if not better, as the usual cotton ones.  </li>
      <li>Only very light rubbing is necessary as the water jumps off your skin and hair like a magnet to metal.  </li>
      <li>* A little static in the dryer (but not as much as their microfibre \\&quot;terry\\&quot;</li>
      <li>I have the opportunity to use this in situations where saving weight or quick drying is critical</li>
      <li>- I would&#x27;ve been better off with a regular, smaller towel.</li>
      <li>they are super absorbent and as such do not glide over the skin like plush cotton towels do.  </li>
      <li>Compact and highly absorbent.</li>
      <li>The size is extremely generous, but it also fits easily in a gym bag when folded.  </li>
      <li>On the other hand, it did not dry overnight after I hand-washed the towel itself (getting it really soaked) and hung it in a damp room, so it doesn&#x27;t have magical drying powers.  </li>
      <li>This towel dried overnight regardless of how many items of clothes I had blotted with it.  </li>
      <li>I like them so much I am getting two extra large towels for myself and two for my sister who also lives on her sailboat.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Maybe I was expecting too much.&lt;br /&gt;But I tried this out in my bathroom and found...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GOOD:&lt;br /&gt;- Light&lt;br /&gt;- Does dry my body well when rubbed against me closely.&lt;br /&gt;- No fluff/lint/anything residue&#x27;d on my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOT-SO-GOOD:&lt;br /&gt;- Just doesn&#x27;t feel comfy&lt;br /&gt;- Have to carefully press it against me to get the drying benefit (unlike a towel that I can sort of flail around)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I have the opportunity to use this in situations where saving weight or quick drying is critical, I probably upgrade this to four stars.  But for now, it&#x27;s just underwhelming :(</li>
    <li> I replaced all of our cotton towels with these.  With two teenage daughters it seemed there was always a shortage of clean dry towels and all the washing/drying was a waste of energy.  After washing these towels, we just throw them back on the towel rack (no dryer) and they are dry by morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They take a little getting used to:  they are super absorbent and as such do not glide over the skin like plush cotton towels do.  Great for drying hair too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ll never buy cotton towels again.</li>
    <li> Tired of having your gym towel still damp from your workout the day before? Then get this towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you prefer your own towel to those thread bare, ultra bleached towels the gym provides, skip the cotton bath towel and use the Aquis microfiber instead. It&#x27;s soft, absorbent, and dries quickly. Wash it like regular laundry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But make sure you get XL. The other sizes, according to reviews, won&#x27;t fit around your waist for walking to and from the shower. The XL covers up just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though you won&#x27;t mistake it for a plush, 5 star hotel towel, you will appreciate having something that stores in your locker and is dry the next time you workout.</li>
    <li> I got this towel to use at the Y for water exercise class. It is long enough to wrap my body and dry me after pool and then after shower easily. It isn&#x27;t dripping wet and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy when damp. It is absorbent enough for these tasks. It is big enough to take to the beach or other activity. It is also soft and not chamois-like. It feels nice. So far I have washed it with my other pool items using a gentle short cycle and drop of soap. I have hung it out to dry since it is summer. The color I got, seafoam, is a muted light green. The picture on my computer screen doesn&#x27;t portray this color accurately but I don&#x27;t much care about the color and figured seafoam would be light green as it is. This Aquis Adventure Microfiber Towel is just fine. In fact, I have been so pleased with it, I have ordered another. The large would probably have been big enough for drying but I wanted plenty of length for wrapping so consider your size and needs. It is a good towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update after a month: I have now machine-dried this towel several times on the low setting of the dryer. It is as good as new. I use it several times a week and wash it each time. I am glad I got it. It&#x27;s funny, managing this towel has been so easy and convenient, I have yet to use the second ordered. The towel comes in a little bag and would make a terrific gift for the gym rat in your life.</li>
    <li> Took this thing camping, to the gym, around the house... does what it&#x27;s supposed to.  Absorb like crazy and dry really fast.  I intend to get some more smaller sizes for camping!</li>
    <li> We would recommend this towel.&lt;br /&gt;Microfiber drying towels are the ultimate in drying towels.&lt;br /&gt;Soft, lightweight, and durable.&lt;br /&gt;Great towel for the price.[[ASIN:B00GTE0L4Q Show Car Guys 3 - Pack Of Ultra Blue Plush Microfiber Towels 16\\&quot; x 16 \\&quot;- At 360 GSM, This Is One Of Our Best Microfiber Cleaning Cloths-It Has Ultra Plush Micro Fiber Material On One Side, And The Other Side Consists Of Medium Terry Microfiber Material.]]</li>
    <li> The limited number of microfiber towels I have used, this is by far my favorite!  It is more &#x27;compact&#x27; and the feel is just as good, if not better, as the usual cotton ones.  It&#x27;s not cheap but I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I just returned from a trip to Central America. I used this towel and was pleased with its absorbency and feel. It dried quickly and when I used it on the beach, the sand was easily to shake off. I ordered the extra large size and probably could have ordered the smaller and found it adequate for showering. The larger size was great for the beach, however.</li>
    <li> In my experience all microfiber is not the same and not all microfiber is good... Aquis microfiber is a-1, first rate, top dog, and absorbent, clean and lightweight. My niece and I are mega-fans - we have this size for showers, the &#x27;hair towel&#x27; size for travel or hair, and we&#x27;ve given them as gifts over and over. No need to hesitate - buy it!</li>
    <li> These are sold as &amp;#34;travel towels&amp;#34; but I love them and use them at home. They are so absorbent I dry off in one wipe and I&#x27;m actually dry. Regular towels leave me feeling slightly damp. It&#x27;s crazy how much better these are. My wife has curly hair, and these dry her hair far better than anything else!</li>
    <li> Perfect towel to send to camp with kids.  Regular towels don&#x27;t dry well in a camp environment and therefore wind up smelling and so do the kids.  This is the best solution that I could come up with.  I ordered the extra large for swimming (close to a beach towel size) and large for the shower (a little smaller than a standard bath towel). Also purchased for our college age student for similar reasons.  The towels dry as quickly as you could hope for in camping and college settings.&lt;br /&gt;:-)</li>
    <li> We live on a sailboat and my daughter bought us a couple of the medium towels. I like them so much I am getting two extra large towels for myself and two for my sister who also lives on her sailboat.  Quick drying, absorbent, durable, easy to wash.  I love the snap because I can hang them anywhere easily.</li>
    <li> I bought this towel several years ago for a week-long volunteer work trip in Mexico.  I wanted something that would be absorbant and dry quickly.  It surpassed my expectations.  Now it gets used spring, summer &amp; fall for camping.  My husband used to bring a thin terry cotton towel for camping until he saw how well my Aquis performed.  We each have one and bought a third for our toddler daughter last summer.  They pack small and dry almost instantly.</li>
    <li> I purchased this towel for gym use after an older microfiber towel finally wore out after several years, and after a couple of months of use, it&#x27;s been a very good purchase.  It doesn&#x27;t have the same loops one is used to from regular terry-cloth towels, but it&#x27;s very, very soft and absorbant, and has been since the first time I used it.  (The cleaning instructions say not to use fabric softener, and I don&#x27;t.)  It dries very quickly, so it&#x27;s ideal for gym use.  Unlike cotton towels, it doesn&#x27;t get that nasty odor that sometimes happens.  The size is extremely generous, but it also fits easily in a gym bag when folded.  One probably wouldn&#x27;t want to use it at home in place of regular terry-cloth towels, but you certainly could.  It would also make a good purchase for college students in dorms, since it dries quickly, even when hanging.</li>
    <li> I have several in my car, sports, beach and gym bags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Fabric:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Lisse Crepe -- their original towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Texture: very short pile, no visible loops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Slightly clingy, when drying yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* A little static in the dryer (but not as much as their microfibre \\&quot;terry\\&quot; version)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Very absorbent and lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Comes in many colours and sizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike other membrane/spongy camping/outdoor towels:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* You CAN throw this is in the dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Feels closest to a real towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* XL size covers up more for modesty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sizes and uses:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Size XL is best as a bath towel, b/c you can coverup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Size L was the original hair/gym towel size -- longer and narrower.  Good for a small child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Size M is good as a Hand Towel for when you have people over.  It gets damp but not soggy and will still do its job of drying hands.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect size for backpacking, as it&#x27;s not too small &amp; it also doesn&#x27;t take up much space.</li>
    <li> Excellent towel for drying off my 65-lb. dog after a rainy walk. Very absorbent, dries quickly, rugged quality, yet lightweight.</li>
    <li> The Aquis towel 29*55 is a perfect size. Bought it for my daughter as a x-mass gift (college swimmer). First used it on her training trip. She called home to tell me how much she liked it. Packs easily also.</li>
    <li> A must for traveling especially for camping! I&#x27;ll be buying another one for sure!</li>
    <li> This towel was both compact and sizable.  It took up little luggage space but covered average sized adults after bathing.  We would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for use in Iceland, since pools require you to rent a towel.  I have several Aquis towels I use to dry my hair and I love them.  The only issue is, with microfiber, if your hands are dry, they&#x27;re quite rough.  Not soft.  I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to flat-pack this back in the mesh pouch, so I ended up using the pouch to hold my travel blanket and pillow.  Quite a large towel.  Didn&#x27;t dry terribly fast - I would&#x27;ve been better off with a regular, smaller towel.</li>
    <li> I bought this towel several years ago. It has held its color, shape and absorbency.  The size is more like a regular bath towel, so extra large is misleading, but for microfiber sport towels it is generous.  It is perfect for the gym, camping or jet setting as it folds up compactly and dries really quickly.  Its also a great idea for college students and people in apartments with limited space for storage or access to laundry, as said, it is compact, and also quick dry and does not get moldy/smelly as easily as regular towels.  I think I&#x27;ve only had the issue when I&#x27;ve left a damp towel in my bag for a length of time, but if it is left to air dry, it doesn&#x27;t have the issue.</li>
    <li> Great travel towel.  Works great for a pool towel - fits in a gym bag but absorbs like a regular towel.  Purchased the largest size.  Dries quickly.  Would probably not use for regular home towel but great when space in issue.</li>
    <li> Best lightweight towel.  Great for hikers and weekend adventurers.  Compact and highly absorbent.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend for her hair - she has LOTS of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She loves the towel but said she would rather have a smaller size for doing her hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it to shower, and it is an excellent drying towel - it amazes me how light it is.</li>
    <li> bought this to cut down on gear taken into work when commuting on a road bike.  Its awesome must have.  drys quick, don&#x27;t stink and light.  XL has enough coverage for a 6ft 240lb person.  I&#x27;m thinking of a couple more for home use.</li>
    <li> I use this towel when I go to the pool and am very pleased.  No, it is not fluffy and soft, and yes, it does almost stick to my skin, but it does its job very well.  It dries quickly.  It is lightweight and compact, keeping my gym bag from bulging as if I had crammed every last possession into it.  I would recommend the Aquis Adventure microfiber towel to others.  In fact, I am thinking about ordering another for myself...</li>
    <li> I use this when I go to the gym and it works great.  Soaks up water quickly and is very compact.</li>
    <li> The Aquis towel is a great tool.  I live in Thailand and find it sweeps the water from your body --- feels soft and gentle and DRIES so quickly!!  It is great for travel as it takes up about as much space as a folded T-shirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was just a bit disappointed that the new towel has a weight/feel of 1/2 of the prior towels but works perfectly --- I&#x27;ve been using these towels for years and added&lt;br /&gt;several for house guests.  I love Egyptian cotton terry but in a humid climate --- they don&#x27;t work well without a dryer and finding a dryer is like finding a 4-leaf clover!</li>
    <li> I spent over a year in Iraq with the Army, and took two of these Aquis Adventure towels with me. They stood up to the harsh conditions with no shortcomings. Army laundry is notably hard on textiles, but these towels worked just fine even after 15 months of use, and did not fall apart. Before I got these, I had 100% cotton towels that the Army laundry managed to beat up pretty bad. The Aquis towels started out soft, stayed soft throughout, and didn&#x27;t break down. In fact, they are still my go-to travel towels, and I even keep one in my emergency bag. They pack down nice and small, but they soak up a ton of water and dry out quickly. I got the extra large, and they provided plenty of coverage. The loop with snap was handy more times than I can count. You might be able to find a better towel, but you&#x27;re going to have to search hard. The price may seem daunting, but when you consider the durability, comfort, and features, it&#x27;s a real bargain. If they ever wore out, I&#x27;d buy them again.</li>
    <li> I bought the 29 x 55-inch size to use as a beach towel while traveling.  I ended up using it every night to squeeze the water out of the clothes I hand washed, so they could dry overnight.  (I lay the towel on the floor, lay the wet clothes on the towel, rolled them up together, and stood on the roll to press the water out.)  It&#x27;s amazing how much water this towel blotted up.  In contrast, one night when I had to use a cotton towel, water squished through it all over the floor, and the cotton towel ended up weighing a ton.  This towel dried overnight regardless of how many items of clothes I had blotted with it.  On the other hand, it did not dry overnight after I hand-washed the towel itself (getting it really soaked) and hung it in a damp room, so it doesn&#x27;t have magical drying powers.  But it comes close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also worked fine as a beach towel.  It&#x27;s plenty soft.  It does hang onto the sand, so shaking it out isn&#x27;t enough; it needs washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The carry bag it comes in, mesh on one side, is also very well made. To fit the towel back in, be sure to fold it in thirds once, not just in half.</li>
    <li> I have never used a microfiber towel other than for automotive detailing.  I did not quite know just how such a towel would dry off the body.  What I can say is, this does not feel like anything like a cotton towel while wet and is much softer feeling when dry.  Although the overall feel of this towel is superb it is not quite what I would describe as cotton soft when rubbed against wet skin.  What it lacks in softness, it makes up for in efficiency.  Instead of rubbing the towel all over, blotting seems to be much more effective.  Only very light rubbing is necessary as the water jumps off your skin and hair like a magnet to metal.  The only shred of negativity I have for this towel is just that it does not quite dry as fast as I expected, but still light years faster than any other type of towel.  I was hoping it would dry as fast as my board shorts, but I really do think that is just asking for too much.  I would not buy any size other than the XL unless you are looking for a hand towel.  This is a good all around size for the shower or to lay on the beach.  Did I say portability?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;portability&lt;br /&gt;super-absorbent&lt;br /&gt;Fast drying&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Truly none.  I question the carrying bags zipper, but nothing other than that.</li>
    <li> Love everything about them. I&#x27;m tall, and they are long enough for me.  I bring these all over the world with me. They aren&#x27;t too thick, so they can be easily packed because they don&#x27;t take up much space. I have these in the colors \\&quot;sea foam\\&quot; and \\&quot;blueberry\\&quot;. If you want a great beach towel, for my money, this was the winner.</li>
    <li> Great item-thanks for fast perfect ship-great pricing!</li>
    <li> We bought these for the boat, but they have transitioned into the house. Not the &amp;#34;fluffier&amp;#34; microfiber I&#x27;m used to, but very absorbent. I&#x27;ll be ordering a whole set</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE BEST ON THE MARKET.  I OFTEN GIVE THEM AS GIFTS.  I HAVE TWO AT HOME AND 2 ON THE CENTRAL COAST WHERE I OFTEN VISIT.</li>
    <li> I used this on a month long backpacking trip. Very soft and absorbent. It washes easy and does not hold odor after washing.</li>
