      <li>FREE Recipe eBook!</li>

      <li>I do not like most most scents in oil</li>
      <li>Although I love Neutrogena stuff and use many of their products, I will stick to [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad this oil is still around.</li>
      <li>So this product serves many purposes.</li>
      <li>Get it and enjoy!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how Neutrogena does it, but this body oil works great for leaving skin feeling moisturized, soft, and silky with NO greasy residue.</li>
      <li>It works best if applied to damp skin and then lightly towel dry.  </li>
      <li>Product does not leave skin oily when used correctly, and solves the winter-itch problem easily.  </li>
      <li>I use coconut oil, also scented but very lightly and it dissipates quickly, after a shower.</li>
      <li>My skin soaks it right up and is very smooth afterword&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>I have used this product for years, both the unscented and the lightly scented version.  </li>
      <li>At this price for 6 bottles of Neutrogena Body Oil Light Sesame Formula, each one comes to a $10.17 cents.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s free of oil</li>
      <li>I was given a bottle of the lightly scented version to review.</li>
      <li>Not so Neutrogena Light Sesame Formula.</li>
      <li>I’ve also used it smoothed on my face as a light day moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Neutrogena Body Oil- Light</li>
      <li>Neither of us found the lightly scented fragrance overbearing or the oil too sticky.</li>
      <li>It has a slight smell, which I think is very pleasant.  </li>
      <li>This oil is fantastic -- though light in consistency, the oil feels rich on the skin.</li>
      <li>This Sesame Body Oil has a light clean scent that fades quickly and the oil is easy to dispense from the flip cap slender bottle.</li>
      <li>My usually dry skin feels great after using this body oil.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a very nice oil, and each jar will last a long while, as the oil can be used quite sparingly for a good effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It goes on right after a shower and absorbs quickly without feeling greasy or sticky, leaving your skin feeling smooth and silky all day.</li>
      <li>Neutrogena body oil (light sesame formula) is a quick moisturizer to use right after a shower.  </li>
      <li>What I like about this oil is that it absorbs quickly</li>
      <li>I would simply say that have been thrilled with this product.</li>
      <li>so I can get dressed right away if need be.</li>
      <li>just right.</li>
      <li>Overall, a fantastic product!</li>
      <li>When I run out, I will definitely buy more.</li>
      <li>It really makes my skin soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>love Neutrogena’s other bath products and this one ranks right up there with the others.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite product to use for dry skin in the winter.</li>
      <li>Fractionated Coconut Oil - 100% Pure Premium Grade - PUMP + SQUEEZE CAP +</li>
      <li>/&gt;Another nice little benefit to these bottles; each one is sealed separately under the cap, so that there is no chance of spillage during shipping.</li>
      <li>- BIG 16Oz - Best Carrier Oil &amp; Base For Essential Oils, Aromatherapy &amp; Massage - Great for Roll-On</li>
      <li>This one is light enough to not bother me at all.</li>
      <li>Much to my surprise, however, I did not notice any real sesame scent in this oil, which when applied to moist skin, after showering, just seemed to melt into my body.  </li>
      <li>What I really like is</li>
      <li>I put it on my damp skin after showering and my skin stays silky smooth and feels moisturized until my next shower.</li>
      <li>Absorption can be a bit tricky, so using less is definitely more.</li>
      <li>Simply squirt maybe a teaspoon of the product into your hands, rub them together, then quickly spread the oil onto your body.  </li>
      <li>It really does vanish into your skin so your skin is not slick or greasy feeling.  </li>
      <li>and I would highly recommend it for all skin types.  </li>
      <li>Not thick like applying strait almond oil to your skin.  </li>
      <li>and I enjoy using it instead of body lotion which feels heavy and sticky during hot summer days.</li>
      <li>Her feedback is very positive on this product and uses it on a daily basis.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is light and airy...sort of that standard Neutrogena scent, but maybe with a bit of beach mixed in.</li>
      <li>It feels very soft and silky and the skin does not itch.</li>
      <li>You can buy this case and be confident you will get all the oil you paid for, and not a wet box and half or quarter</li>
      <li>My wife used this during her first pregnancy and is using it during her second as a body massage oil.</li>
      <li>Now, be super careful not to drip any on the floor because it will make that area slippery (and this is also why I would say to avoid applying while standing in the shower).</li>
      <li>/&gt;While it&#x27;s summer now, I imagine this oil will come in especially handy during the winter months, when cold and dry heat indoors dries out one&#x27;s corpus and the skin cries out for hydration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Goes on right after the shower, dab dry and off you go.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an old fashioned perfume odor that reminds me of lotions and perfumes</li>
      <li>So far, I&#x27;ve never had any of this transfer to clothing or towels, which was a concern.</li>
      <li>I can be sensitive to some scented products, they can give me headaches.</li>
      <li>Give it as much time as possible to sink in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Simply put, the only thing they accomplished was to lighten my wallet while leaving my skin feeling like it was on fire.</li>
      <li>Lotions are never enough, don&#x27;t last, and many body oils are like baby oil and too thick and greasy and skin smothering.  </li>
      <li>Needless to say, she loved it enough to go for it the second time.</li>
      <li>When applying other lotions to my dry skin, I had to wait a bit before they were absorbed.  </li>
      <li>The light sesame scent is very faint and absorbs into the skin quickly.</li>
      <li>Having dry, sensitive skin, I&#x27;ve been using Neut Body Oil daily for years.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This brand is dermatologist recommended and I while I have tried plenty of their facial products I had never tried a body oil.  This Sesame Body Oil has a light clean scent that fades quickly and the oil is easy to dispense from the flip cap slender bottle. I put it on my damp skin after showering and my skin stays silky smooth and feels moisturized until my next shower. It definitely covers my ashy spots on my pale skin around my knees and elbows and I enjoy using it instead of body lotion which feels heavy and sticky during hot summer days. This is a great alternative for gorgeous summer skin for wearing shorts and tank tops.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how Neutrogena does it, but this body oil works great for leaving skin feeling moisturized, soft, and silky with NO greasy residue. You just splash it on after the shower and let it air dry. So far, I&#x27;ve never had any of this transfer to clothing or towels, which was a concern. Even better, the smell is clean, long-lasting, and quite wonderful.</li>
    <li> This oil is fantastic -- though light in consistency, the oil feels rich on the skin. Absorption can be a bit tricky, so using less is definitely more. The fragrance is not strong, but it will linger after application. My usually dry skin feels great after using this body oil. Overall, a fantastic product!</li>
    <li> My wife has used this for over a week.  Verdict.  Too oily.  She will not use it again.</li>
    <li> Neutrogena body oil (light sesame formula) is a quick moisturizer to use right after a shower.  Simply squirt maybe a teaspoon of the product into your hands, rub them together, then quickly spread the oil onto your body.  Unless you use too much, your skin will not feel oily, and the fragrance of so little of the oil is hardly noticeable, a plus, in my opinion.  The secret is to use it sparingly. I have used this product for years, both the unscented and the lightly scented version.  Five stars.</li>
    <li> Neutrogena Body Oil- Light Sesame-  This is a very nicely scented oil to use just after your shower.  It works best if applied to damp skin and then lightly towel dry.  It will transfer to you bath towel and also make it smell wonderful.  This oil is very light as it says in the title.  Not thick like applying strait almond oil to your skin.  Honestly I also think the scent is gender neutral.</li>
    <li> I was somewhat reluctant to try this Neutrogena Body Oil because I did not want to smell of sesame oil, a product which I use extensively in cooking.  Much to my surprise, however, I did not notice any real sesame scent in this oil, which when applied to moist skin, after showering, just seemed to melt into my body.  When applying other lotions to my dry skin, I had to wait a bit before they were absorbed.  Not with this oil;  Really nice product!</li>
    <li> Neutrogena body oil was recommended to me by a female gynecologist for use as oil based lubricant.  So this product serves many purposes. Added to bath water, it softens your skin while you bathe.  It really does vanish into your skin so your skin is not slick or greasy feeling.  What I hate about this product is the smell.  It has a putrid strange floral smell that gives me a sick headache.  It&#x27;s an old fashioned perfume odor that reminds me of lotions and perfumes my grandmas had in the 60&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like this product if it were odorless but I can&#x27;t get over the smell.</li>
    <li> This is a great oil that leaves no residue. I do not like most most scents in oil but this is essentially nonexistent (at least to my nose. I typically don&#x27;t like flower scents or men&#x27;s aftershave scents). I use this after showering and I have noticed my skins is much less dry. I&#x27;m looking forward to using it this winter when I suffer from excessive dryness. This is probably the least oily formula I have tried right after coconut oils.</li>
    <li> The oil itself is great, but to me it smells like suntan oil. I use coconut oil, also scented but very lightly and it dissipates quickly, after a shower. Although I love Neutrogena stuff and use many of their products, I will stick to [[ASIN:B00P8CQK90 Fractionated Coconut Oil - 100% Pure Premium Grade - PUMP + SQUEEZE CAP + FREE Recipe eBook! - BIG 16Oz - Best Carrier Oil &amp; Base For Essential Oils, Aromatherapy &amp; Massage - Great for Roll-On Bottles - Soothing for Skin &amp; Hair!]]</li>
    <li> I have always loved this oil but I haven&#x27;t used it in years, I thought it had been discontinued. I was given a bottle of the lightly scented version to review. I can be sensitive to some scented products, they can give me headaches. This one is light enough to not bother me at all. Because the weather has been so warm, I add peppermint oil when I use this. It is refreshing and cooling. I am a big fan of using oils to moisturize my skin, though than can be greasy. What I like about this oil is that it absorbs quickly so I can get dressed right away if need be. I usually just towel off to slightly damp skin then use this oil and air dry. It really makes my skin soft and smooth. I&#x27;m glad this oil is still around. When I run out, I will definitely buy more.</li>
    <li> I have used this on and off since I was a teen. It is a somewhat tricky product in that you might need a little practice to get the amount just right. Too much, and you are greasy/oily (and your clothes will be none too happy about that). Too little, and you do not receive the benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what to do: apply this the second you step out of the shower. Now, be super careful not to drip any on the floor because it will make that area slippery (and this is also why I would say to avoid applying while standing in the shower). You will need to give the oil a little bit to absorb, so continue with your morning routine sans clothing. Brush your teeth, apply your make-up, etc. Give it as much time as possible to sink in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, this will leave your skin silky but you have to strike that perfect balance ... or else you may be reshowering. Therefore, the first time you give this a try, underestimate your needs a bit and then work up to the perfect amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for those dry months!</li>
    <li> I put this on my body, hands and legs after a shower. It has nice fragrance and the feel of the oil on my skin is wonderful. I am used to the regular body lotions such as Dove, Nivea and St. Ives, all with water base, but this \\&quot;oily\\&quot; product is a welcome change. It feels very soft and silky and the skin does not itch. It is therapeutic for someone who has dry skin. I usually put every day in the morning after shower, and do not feel itchy all day. This is a nice alternative to water based body lotions.</li>
    <li> I need to moisturize my skin everyday. It is dry, and then hurts like you could only imagine. I have tried products aimed at men, or labeled &amp;#34;men&#x27;s care.&amp;#34; They have not worked at all. Simply put, the only thing they accomplished was to lighten my wallet while leaving my skin feeling like it was on fire. That&#x27;s not what I hoped they would accomplish when I purchased them, but it is what they did. So, I decided to try this item after it was offered on Amazon Vine. I gave it a try, and it worked. It help keep my skin moist, and did not have any scent. I would simply say that have been thrilled with this product. Get it and enjoy!</li>
    <li> At this price for 6 bottles of Neutrogena Body Oil Light Sesame Formula, each one comes to a $10.17 cents. That&#x27;s a lot for body oil, and I could not afford to pay that much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, I am delighted to have received a free jar of the oil to sample, at is has a delightful scent and it smooths the skin very nicely, leaving no greasy after effect. Nor does it clog the pores or create rashes or allergic reactions of any sort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very nice oil, and each jar will last a long while, as the oil can be used quite sparingly for a good effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it&#x27;s summer now, I imagine this oil will come in especially handy during the winter months, when cold and dry heat indoors dries out one&#x27;s corpus and the skin cries out for hydration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another nice little benefit to these bottles; each one is sealed separately under the cap, so that there is no chance of spillage during shipping. You can buy this case and be confident you will get all the oil you paid for, and not a wet box and half or quarter-empty bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All together very nice, except the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample of this product in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> Very light oil that leaves a beautiful, sexy sheen on your skin, not oily or greasy at all.  Amazing scent, reminds me of the beach and the ocean, not flowery or over bearing.  I am very happy to have received the opportunity to try this oil, and will never go without it.  This is one product I will continue to use and order through Amazon.  Lotions are never enough, don&#x27;t last, and many body oils are like baby oil and too thick and greasy and skin smothering.  This truly is a wonderful, great smelling, sexy product.  Love love!</li>
    <li> Having dry, sensitive skin, I&#x27;ve been using Neut Body Oil daily for years. Goes on right after the shower, dab dry and off you go. The light sesame scent is very faint and absorbs into the skin quickly. Only downfall is you slosh it around, will have to clean the base of the shower so it&#x27;s free of oil but I don&#x27;t as I don&#x27;t want to waste a drop!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan of most Neutrogena products, and this body oil is no exception. It goes on right after a shower and absorbs quickly without feeling greasy or sticky, leaving your skin feeling smooth and silky all day. The fragrance is light and airy...sort of that standard Neutrogena scent, but maybe with a bit of beach mixed in. Definitely a nice alternative to heavy lotions and creams - if you like Neutrogena products, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Neutrogena Body Oil leaves skin super-soft when used after showering.  This is my favorite product to use for dry skin in the winter. It has a slight smell, which I think is very pleasant.  Product does not leave skin oily when used correctly, and solves the winter-itch problem easily.  Just a little bit rubbed on skin after shower does the trick, then pat dry, and off you go.  I always have a bottle sitting in the shower.  My skin loves it!</li>
    <li> I received a bottle of Neutrogena Body Oil for an honest review. Earlier this year I reviewed another brand and was skeptical since brand x left a “film” on my body that I didn’t like. Not so Neutrogena Light Sesame Formula. This oil really absorbs into your skin and leaves it soft and supple (and since I’m no spring chicken, that says a lot!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Neutrogena’s other bath products and this one ranks right up there with the others. I use it after my bath while my skin is still damp. The oil vanishes into my skin within minutes, leaves it soft and very delicately scented. I’ve also used it smoothed on my face as a light day moisturizer. I could add a few drops of essential oil, however, I love the delicate fragrance already there so won’t do that. This is truly a delightful boon to any skin type. I love it!</li>
    <li> Excellent body oil.  its very light and non greasy.  My skin soaks it right up and is very smooth afterword&#x27;s.  This is the best body oil I have ever used and I would highly recommend it for all skin types.  What I really like is a small amount goes a long way and thus this oil lasts much longer than the cheaper oils like almond oil.  It is well packaged and an addition to any bathroom.</li>
    <li> My wife used this during her first pregnancy and is using it during her second as a body massage oil. Needless to say, she loved it enough to go for it the second time. Her feedback is very positive on this product and uses it on a daily basis. Neither of us found the lightly scented fragrance overbearing or the oil too sticky. Will recommend to anyone.</li>
