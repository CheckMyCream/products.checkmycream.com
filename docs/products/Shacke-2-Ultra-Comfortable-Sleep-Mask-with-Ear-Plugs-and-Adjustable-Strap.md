<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Fits ok.  Cut the tabs off where they place the earplugs so it&#x27;s not pressing. Smell is awful and doesn&#x27;t air out after a few days.  All in all unless you are really smell-averse the mask is fine.</li>
    <li> I have slept with sleep masks for years and this is a very durable and comfortable product. It has a thick adjustable strap compared to thin strings that you find attached to the products in local retail stores. It has a fleece lining that is soft against your skin. If you have a very small head it may not fit like you want, but for me it is perfect and will continue to be even as the strap stretches with continued use. I am pleased there are two in the pack also.</li>
    <li> Great mask - doesn&#x27;t press on eyes and blocks out light! I&#x27;ll buy another set when I wear these out.</li>
    <li> I received okay. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the quality. They have a snug fit. Very comfortable. Came quicker than I expected. Which was nice. I love the design with the space to keep the earplugs. Great price, too.</li>
    <li> so cute! gave them to my teenage twins for christmas. they loved them!</li>
    <li> Great product. Super fast shipping</li>
    <li> Good value, just what I wanted for travel.  I like the way that the earplugs fit into the headband on the eye mask, so that they don&#x27;t get lost.</li>
    <li> I ordered these as a gift to my mother who has been in desperate need of one for quite sometime now. I was, in all honestly, skeptical about ordering these due to the few negative reviews but I decided to try these out and I am so glad I did! They look just like they do in the picture( I ordered the black ones ) and the Velcro straps are perfect for adjustments. They do what they&#x27;re suppose too and are great from anyone who suffers from migraines due to the lack of sleep because of light. The fact that I purchased these for much less than another single mask is another huge bonus. You cannot go wrong with these!</li>
    <li> Great quality product especially for the price! They know how to treat customers. Highly reccommended!</li>
    <li> Does the job. Adjustable strap is awesome.</li>
    <li> Love them  Best sleep I&#x27;ve had in a while!  Thanks</li>
    <li> Great value for the price, and the earplugs + storage solution are convenient. Still allows light through at the nose area, as it doesn&#x27;t conform to my face, but good enough for my purposes and considering the price.</li>
    <li> Great price! Great product! Arrived quickly. Would definitely order again!</li>
    <li> Keeps light out. Fits great and doesn&#x27;t move while you sleep!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband who loves to nap on the sofa, but is prone to covering his eyes with unseemly items such as socks (and worse, but I digress). Seriously. He loves this mask(s), because it doesn&#x27;t slip off his head when he naps. I love them, because it saves me from looking at a guy with a sock on his face. A win-win!</li>
    <li> These are great in terms of fit and blocking out the light, however it has caused black ink to run all over my white sheets.</li>
    <li> works well.  velcro strap can be uncomfortable but that is probably me.  my spare mask has a elastic strap that is  a bit more comfortable.  ths mask is much better.  the ear plugs on strap stay n place ,don&#x27;t fall out of strap when not in use.  i don&#x27;t give 5 stars.</li>
    <li> they seem to work ok.  there is an odor, at first, but it seems ok. ,earplugs do not hold form.  adjustable band and velcro allow for comfortable fit.</li>
    <li> Mask is well made - but lets way too much light in around the bridge of the nose.  I let my wife try it to see if she could use it - but she had the same results.</li>
    <li> Blocks out light and works great for sleeping. Ear plugs are a nice addition</li>
    <li> Comfortable and keeps all the light out. It is also adjustable.</li>
    <li> Worked great as advertised.  It is functional.  The packaging said it would smell from the factory and it did.  Thanks for the heads up.  It was fine after it aired out.</li>
    <li> Very good value for the price. They do have an odor when you first open the package, but I washed them on gentle cycle in a nylon bag and they are now fresh and ready for use.They are comfortable and fit well.</li>
    <li> Very comfortable! !  happy i purchased them. Only wished they had ones with lavender to help me sleep.</li>
    <li> Great price, one for me and one for my wife! Blocks out sound and light very effectively. Good to keep on hand if, like me, you get migrane headaches.</li>
    <li> It came super fast. Cheap quality mask but it does the job.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my boyfriend and I! We love them and now can not fall asleep without them! Great buy for the price and the ear plugs are an added bonus since we live and a loft!</li>
    <li> Very fast service! Totally blocks out light! Love the purchase! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Items as described.  Kids love them!</li>
    <li> I like the mask, getting used to wearing it. Slept well the second night.</li>
    <li> Godd, i love thisssss... I was tired of my wife watching TV or reading when i am really tired and just want to sleep. I got these babies and now i can sleep through her House of Card Binge session. Sleep mask blocks the light out very well and makes it dark.. But do keep in mind that since the area where nose meets the eyes, there will be a small gap and if you dont wear the mask properly, light can come through that gap. Nothing a bit of adjustment cant fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now after buying this mask, i am wearing it daily to sleep and believe me when i say that i am getting more sleep than what i used to get. (maybe it is because it feels like night even when it is 12 noon :D )</li>
    <li> These work great, though the Velcro could be a little better.</li>
    <li> They ok for the price. Great for travel</li>
    <li> Excellent Item. Thanks</li>
    <li> I truly like these masks. They keep everything dark and don&#x27;t slide around on my face. Only things that kept me from leaving a 5 star are: the ear plugs aren&#x27;t good quality and their holsters can be uncomfortable if laid on directly.</li>
    <li> Love that it is adjustable. Used on an international flight and was very comfortable to use. You can see a bit of light towards the bottom but when you have your eyes closed it&#x27;s not a biggie, it won&#x27;t disrupt you.</li>
    <li> Light still can get thought.</li>
    <li> Does it&#x27;s job of masking out light and the adjustable strap helps to make it comfortable to sleep with.</li>
    <li> I need it to be completely dark and quiet for me to fall asleep, I didn&#x27;t want to spend too much so after looking around I decided to give these a try.  First thing I noticed was it smelled as if they were colored with a Sharpie marker, the smell was pretty strong. Second the straps kept cutting into my ear but do adjust. The ear plugs (you get two pairs) are trash, I&#x27;ve never really had luck with ear plugs but I mean these did absolutely nothing for me. Overall you get what you pay for and this is for like a quick nap or for a plane ride. I don&#x27;t recommend these, keep looking.</li>
    <li> I bought the masks for my boyfriend, they are great besides it is too tight on his head which prevents him from wearing them.  I wish there were bigger sizes.  :)</li>
    <li> I love this item!!!! It&#x27;s just the right size, has a wider band that stays in place. It keeps the light out and lets me sleep. Working nights and sleeping days is a lot easier now. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Works great! Good eye coverage! Arrived promptly as stated.</li>
    <li> Good product for the price.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Fully adjustable and comfortable.  Keeps the light out completely so I can get to sleep.</li>
    <li> Just as hoped adjustable and the earplugs were a bonus</li>
    <li> Excellent! Light and comfortable. Completely blocks out light and keeps the morning sun from ruining my sleep in the mornings.</li>
    <li> This was one of the best investments in my sleep, as I have a schedule that has changed and sleeping was a issue. Very good product, soft to touch and comfortable to wear.</li>
    <li> The sleep mask is comfortable and does the job.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and great value!</li>
    <li> Great product.  I especially like the adjustable velcro strap to fit any size.  Delivery time was as stated - very quick.</li>
    <li> We just used them on a trip to the Philippines and they worked great and comfortable with adjustable strap.  The ear plugs were an added bonus.</li>
    <li> Earplugs don&#x27;t work. Mask slips off while sleeping.</li>
    <li> So soft ,keeps all light out,will buy more</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I was looking for.  Affordable and pretty comfortable for my liking.  They also shipped quickly and they make sure you know that they are there to fix any problems you may have.  I appreciated that.</li>
    <li> Works great. Very comfortable and fast shipping</li>
    <li> Very comfortable and excellent customer service</li>
    <li> I work nights and this product was what I needed to get some much needed &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; sleep. I recommend highly recommend it for it&#x27;s comfort as well.</li>
    <li> For this price - it&#x27;s absolutely Excellent.&lt;br /&gt;It would have been worth the money even if it was just for one mask, but then you get two?!&lt;br /&gt;Even better ☺</li>
    <li> Great price for 2 masks. They work great with my cPap mask.</li>
    <li> Works well, great price.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time. I was originally only expecting one mask, but was pleasantly surprised when I learned that I actually got two. The strap was easily adjusted, it just took a little bit of getting use to the mask actually being on but I slept with out worry of any stray light bothering me.</li>
    <li> These masks are amazing! The delivery was out of this world fast.. Im very impressed with everything...</li>
    <li> I really love these sleeping masks. I&#x27;ve had them for a while, and the Velcro isn&#x27;t annoying. Once, maybe twice, my hair did get caught in the Velcro, but once you fix the strap you&#x27;re fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how you can out the ear plugs in the mask. My cat enjoys playing with them, so the holder is very useful to keep my cat away.</li>
    <li> These are a good deal for the money, and if you forget one on the airplane it&#x27;s no biggie.  They block most of the light and are really comfortable.  I do feel my eyelashes rubbing against the inside if I blink - they&#x27;re a petty snug fit.  Also included is a pair of foam ear plugs that store in loops in the strap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The band is elastic and velcro adjustable.  There&#x27;s also a flap that rests across the bridge of your nose to block more light.</li>
    <li> The mask is comfortable and blocks out all light so I am able to sleep very well.</li>
    <li> I use a mask to sleep every night.  I don&#x27;t rest will with the slightest bit of light.  The mask is even better than I had hoped for and I got two! I have never had one with velcro and the others would become loose over time so I hope I may never have to order another one. I don&#x27;t need or use the earplugs but I just cut the part off that holds them and I am good too go. The part that covers the nose was a great surprise when I realized it helps block out even more light.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my daughter. She needs a mask to fall asleep every night. This product is great. It fits very comfortably. The adjustable straps are nice, as she is younger and I can size it perfectly for her. For me, it was everything I would want in a sleep mask, comfort and fit.</li>
    <li> Delivered on time and just what I was looking for. Good quality for the price.</li>
    <li> These are fairly comfortable sleep masks, that fit pretty well and only let a little light in through the nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They keep things dark enough that if you close your eyes it is dark enough to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But ... they really would only work well for me if I was using them while trying to sleep on a recliner or a chair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I&#x27;ve worn them to bed -- and I&#x27;ve tried it a few times -- they always end up falling off. One night I woke up, wondering where they were, and found the velcro stuck to my hair. I own another brand of sleep mask and while this one is a bit more comfortable, that one works better over all because the adjustable strap doesn&#x27;t use velcro and doesn&#x27;t come open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I thought was unique and helpful about this one is that it has little &amp;#34;holsters&amp;#34; for ear plugs. I have a hard time sleeping if there is any noise or any light, so I thought these would be useful. I tried the ear plugs, however, and they did almost nothing to block sound. Even the sound of someone typing on a computer nearby is not muffled when I have the plugs in, so I don&#x27;t find them to be helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: the mask is comfortable and works pretty good to block light, but I don&#x27;t like the velcro strap. The earplugs are not very useful. (I received a sample of this product for the purpose of testing and review.)</li>
    <li> Great pair of sleeping masks!!!</li>
    <li> This is my first sleep mask ever and I haven&#x27;t slept with it yet, but putting it on it feels comfortable to me and it only lets very little light in through the nose, unlike other sleep masks that don&#x27;t have nose padding. Also it&#x27;s a great value, it comes with two sleep masks and two pairs of ear plugs. Seems to work well for side sleepers like me.</li>
    <li> Great product, great price, great customer service!</li>
    <li> Love it! Super comfortable and soft. Love that I got two! Sleeping soooo much better now.</li>
    <li> The back velcro straps are elastic.  However, I have a real big head, and there is only about a quarter inch overlap.  If there had been more, I would have given this product another star.&lt;br /&gt;With more overlap, the elastic puts pressure on the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;The ear plugs are better than others which I have purchased, because they provide a fuller fit in the ear, reducing noise.</li>
    <li> bought for a friend they needed them, they use them</li>
    <li> The things I love about this mask:  1.) The purchase comes with 2 masks 2.) The mask is completely comfortable.  3.) I actually slept until 10 am which is later than I&#x27;ve slept since college... This mask does the trick.  Did I mention it was comfortable?  Great buy!</li>
    <li> Comfortable sleeping masks and a good value for the money. I like how they are pink, to add a touch of color. The straps are wide so they dont create lines on my face after sleeping which was one of my main concerns with my old ones. The masks are soft and fully block out the light without being heavy to wear.</li>
    <li> As described. Great shipping</li>
    <li> Im a male 5&#x27;11&amp;#34; 195lbs and the mask barely covers both eyes, I wish the manufacturer would make them a little wider n longer.  This fits my girlfriend perfectly fine.</li>
    <li> Dont think ive slept better than when i first used these...why didnt i buy this before. Great price and good quality</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with the product received. It is a good quality mask and its cool that they come with the ear plugs.</li>
    <li> I love my sleep masks, I got two so gave one to my hubby</li>
    <li> A+ sleeping mask. I was able to get it prime shipping so didn&#x27;t need to wait. Now I get sound sleep,every night.&lt;br /&gt;It keeps out all/any light that you happen to be around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 1/16/2016:&lt;br /&gt;Both masks band elasticity has become worn. This was only just to normal evening bedtime use. Kind of unusual but I got what I paid for I guess.</li>
    <li> Its great for sleeping</li>
    <li> Not perfect, but pretty good; don&#x27;t regret purchasing and use it most nights. That said, I have a few relatively minor complaints: 1) Straps are a little uncomfortable on the ears when they sit right on them—I wish they were rounder/covered in some really soft fabric, 2) Pretty good effort made here, but a bit of light does tend to sneak in the bottom, especially if not pulled down far enough, and the mask does sometimes slip up off my eyes a bit. Not terrible by any means but not perfect 3) The little earplug-holder is a cool idea, but the earplugs themselves are useless—really stiff and I can&#x27;t get them to conform to my ear canals. I&#x27;ve used plenty of others without trouble, too&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite my small complaints, all things considered, this does work well, and it&#x27;s quite comfortable on the front of my face.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Keeps light out&lt;br /&gt;- Soft inner lining&lt;br /&gt;- Sturdy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Strap cuts into top of ears&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strap made it uncomfortable enough that I couldn&#x27;t fall asleep while wearing these, which defeats the purpose of the sleep mask for me. Thinner straps made out of a smoother material might help. The earplug holders also sometimes scratch up against my left ear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The earplugs that came with the mask are decent, about as good as any foam earplugs you can buy.</li>
    <li> great for sleeping into the morning hours which is necessary for shift work.</li>
    <li> They stink...i have bought many night masks none...i mean none stink like this i will be sending them back.  Even a week later they stink.  i dont know what chemicals are on this and dont want them getting on my skin or in my eyes...</li>
    <li> Drawbacks of these masks are that the dye rubs off onto the pillow case and the extra bit of fabric for the earplug holders causes discomfort when sleeping on that side.</li>
    <li> Arrived as promised. Fits well and is comfortable. However, I agree with the reviewers who indicated that it left some stains on pillow. They came out with a bit of work but wife was not happy.</li>
    <li> Both the ear plugs &amp; blackout mask work well.</li>
    <li> Great eye mask, soft on your face and I love that it&#x27;s adjustable. My only qualm is the material of the elastic band, it could be lighter and softer. It&#x27;s a little heavy on the ears.</li>
    <li> Cute and practical, soft, fits well.</li>
    <li> Awesome mask! I go to be earlier than hubs (work sch differ) and he likes the tv left on. This mask blocks the light perfectly. The ear plugs are a great addition for a restful nights sleep.</li>
    <li> The eye mask is great for blocking out any light. It has a piece that covers your nose, which is the place where most light gets in. The earplugs are pretty good but you have to squeeze them a lot to get them to sit comfortably in your ear. These are the best and the price was very reasonable. You even get two masks and two sets of earplugs.</li>
    <li> Very good quality masks. Excellent price and fast shipping!! I highly recommend!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great eye mask. It fits well and doesn&#x27;t come off while you&#x27;re sleeping. Love the ear plug holder! However, it takes forever to get rid of the strange package smell. I washed it a ton and aired it out but it took forever.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Exceeded my expectations.</li>
