<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Seems to work well. Isn&#x27;t oily at all. That&#x27;s what I love most about it</li>
    <li> Did not notice any results good or bad</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast and customer service was very nice. It feels good on the skin and absorbs quickly!</li>
    <li> A Very Good Product!!!!!</li>
    <li> I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT FOR A FEW WEEKS  I HAVE NOTICED MY COMPLEXION IS A LOT SMOOTHER AND MY CROWS FEET ARE LOOKING BETTER.I HOPE TO SEE MORE IN A FEW MONTHS.</li>
    <li> I di love this product. I am 70 and my face has started ti wrinkle. It has also taken on a &amp;#34;gray&amp;#34; look. I have been using this product for almost a week. My face already feels firmed and smoother. But the big thing is, it gives my face a glow that lasts all day. LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> This is a big bottle! I might be using it excessively but I also want to use the product before it goes bad.  The color when it came was cloudy, but apparently freshly made serums are cloudy.  There&#x27;s no weird smell and it makes my skin so nice and soft! Recommend!</li>
    <li> I love this serum - it soaks right into my skin, which makes me believe that my skin needs it!  It does not leave my skin feeling oily or greasy.  I have been using it for a few weeks and I am noticing a difference in my skin...I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Love this product! A great follow up to a facial I had. absorbs into the skin well and for a fraction of the cost of the higher end products.</li>
    <li> I have received the Vit C serum. I love the way it makes my skin feel. My skin looked instantly brighter and more toned.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical when my friend told me to buy this, but what an amazing product. I have used it religiously since I bought it and after the first week could see results. I am normally not one to post reviews but I love this product. After a few weeks people at work and my friends are actually commenting on the difference in my skin. I will be re-ordering!</li>
    <li> Upon using this, my skin feels 100% better. I don&#x27;t see the lines under my eyes as prominent, and I don&#x27;t see the laugh lines as much either. It&#x27;s a great little boost for skin, and refreshing overall. I&#x27;m impressed with the simplicity found here, as it truly is a gem of a Vitamin C product. Test it out, I love it, and recommend it.</li>
    <li> Was surprised at how large the bottle is (much bigger than usual serum/vitamin bottles), a great value for its price.  Easy to smooth on face and dries well without getting sticky. Have already seen results after only a few days.  Very good product!  Also great customer service, considerate and sincerely interested in customer feedback. Will buy again from them!</li>
    <li> I really like this particular formulation because it also contains Hyaluronic Acid which really helps with collagen production, I see even more results that with more of a straight vitamin c. I use this daily, I love the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product, in exchange of a honest review.</li>
    <li> I like this product very much I have been using it for a couple of weeks. brown spots are going away. I do recommend this.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  No more breakouts.  Improved skin tone.  Firmer skin with less lines.  And leaves me radiant.  You also can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> so far so good.  have been using this for about a week and my skin tone seems a little fresher and the crows feel seem a little less.  I have VERY sensitive skin and is doesn&#x27;t seem to be bothering my skin at all.  I love it.  really.  this is not a paid or compensated review.  I paid for the product with my own money and I would not hesitate to tell you that you were wasting your money.  everyones skin is different, but it seems to be working for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;40 year old male with fair, combination skin and freckles.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s working. My skin looks and feels better. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Tried only yesterday and already feel results! I am a happy lady! Skin tingles and then feels smoother and more radiant.</li>
    <li> It  is to soon to  know how well it will work. But I do like the  way it makes my face feel, it is not oily and it makes my face feel soft. I also  like the tips from Eve , they are very  helpful. I would recommend it. Thank You, Rikki</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a few weeks already and I notice a difference already. My skin started tighting up after 2nd week. This serum is  definitely thicker then a product I bought from another retailer. Thank you so much Eve for the help and prompt service.</li>
    <li> I tried a Vitamin C product years ago but didnt stick with it and recently received the Vitamin C Serum, about 1 week ago and I really think it is helping the fine lines around my lips and eyes. I am 67 years old so this is important to me. I will see when it has been 2 weeks and again in a month. I use the product after cleansing my face, I let it dry before using a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Eeewwww mine smells funky like cooked ham .......not putting it on my face again</li>
    <li> Absolutely terrific product! The customer service has been incredible! I will DEFINITELY order this again. It is now part of my skin care regimen.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Serum for about 30 days. I can honestly say that this product is amazing!!! I&#x27;ve noticed my pores are much smaller and my face is less oily . I also noticed my face is always glowing and smooth!!!</li>
    <li> 2nd time ordering - great products!</li>
    <li> So great. Love how it makes me skin feel.</li>
    <li> I really feel that this Serum improves the quality of your skin in  tone and looks.  I am over 60 and my skin does not show it.  Nothing can work miracles, but this does come closer than anything I have found previously.  I even think that after about 60 days my age spots look lighter and less noticeable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for less than a month and so far so good! It really helps control my breakouts. The serum absorb pretty quickly as of the smell it&#x27;s a little bit similar to liquid smoke but not strong.</li>
    <li> After three weeks of twice daily use, my skin looks better and fine lines are much reduced.</li>
    <li> Great price!  I like the way the serum makes my skin feel hydrated, especially after working outside in the sun all day.  I&#x27;ve only started using it, but so far, so good!</li>
    <li> I really love this product. Goes on easily and I like the way it feels when it dries. I usually apply a moisturizer over it. Really like this product a lot.</li>
    <li> this was ok. Nothing amazing. Love used the best of the best and for he price I can not complain. I regret not biting the bullet and just purchasing the &amp;#34;real stuff&amp;#34;. I was expecting the same results. Silly me.</li>
    <li> I received this product in exchange for an honest review. Vitamin C Serum has beena life saver for me. It&#x27;s helped reduce the age spots and sun damage on my face from driving and playing sports. I don&#x27;t particularly like the way this one smells. A little rose water would go a long way with it... But it&#x27;s working :)</li>
    <li> I got decent, not great results with this product. It makes pores smaller, which is not much more than an astringent would do. It did, however, give my skin a nice &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; and made it softer.</li>
    <li> Loving the Vitamin C Serum for my face. Arrived early!</li>
    <li> It really makes your face feel soft and smooth</li>
    <li> I have been using it for only a few weeks,  and I don&#x27;t see any changes byet</li>
    <li> I received my purchase about 3 weeks ago. I also purchased the Hyuluranic Acid. I had questions on how to apply the products and if they could be applied together. I emailed Eve Hansen and received an extremely detailed response within 10 minutes. Their customer service is amazing!!! The product is also equally amazing! my lines have already smoothed out and my skin looks smooth. I will definitely order this again!</li>
    <li> Perfect.  It does not smell like citrus,  but is the real deal. I use it twice a day face &amp; neck and see immediate results.  Will buy again. Thanks Eve! Keep up the good work</li>
    <li> Realyl smooth and nice</li>
    <li> Absolutely wonderful! This really works. I truly recommend</li>
    <li> Great product fast shipping. Love it. Will irder again</li>
    <li> I just used the product 3 weeks.  So far so good.</li>
    <li> Great product! It goes on smooth, smells delicious, dries quickly and leaves my face feeling tightened. It&#x27;s slowly lightening the dark spots on my face caused by sun damage though the jury is still out on wrinkle repair. My wrinkles in my forehead do seem a lot softer. Will buy and continue to use. I love that it comes in the 2 oz size and lasts so long for a reasonable price. I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> A+ Transaction, very nice product!!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Love it...</li>
    <li> I had heard that Vitamin C was very good for keeping faces supple and smooth.  I have just recently begun using it but am very happy with the results up to now.</li>
    <li> Great product for my face</li>
    <li> as described..have not had enough time to see how it works</li>
    <li> I did not get any visible changes to my skin after using the 2 ounce bottle.  The first ingredient is aloe.  It felt like I was using plain aloe on my face for the past month.  I will not reorder.&lt;br /&gt;I used all 3 of the Hansen products as they directed me and after using the entire bottle did not see or feel any difference in my skin tone, color, or smoothness.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been about a week now of using this product. I use it twice a day and although the directions say to apply a few drops and pat it in... I use more than that... I&#x27;ve always had wrinkles but the loose skin makes them more noticeable... BUT, this serum not only tightens my skin, it is making it look younger &amp; more healthy.</li>
    <li> So far so good! My face is glowing, pores are smaller and dark spots are actually starting to fade.</li>
    <li> I purchased Vitamin C Serum July 31, 2015 and I must say i see the difference.  I have been using it mainly on my neck area and I am impressed.</li>
    <li> I just started using it, but so far so good.</li>
    <li> Good product. I found you could pay a lot of money for Vitamin C Serum, but why when they all have the same main ingredients.  Eve Hansen offers a nice variety of face serums that work just as well as the higher priced items. I have been using different Vitamin C serum for some time.  I have been using this for weeks and very happy with the results.  I even have been putting in on my arms and legs and they stay soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> Have been using the product for about two weeks and have been pleased with the results.  My skin feels very soft and wrinkles seem smoother.</li>
    <li> Better than I expected</li>
    <li> Been using this product for about three weeks. I have not seen any difference in my skin. I will continue to use it as all skin types are different and I want to give the product time to prove it&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff ..you will see a difference just give it time.. i have to try things for myself because there is so much out there you don&#x27;t know what works and what dosen&#x27;t . I love honesty!!!</li>
    <li> Really.&lt;br /&gt;I was led to believe this was super good for dark spots and even worked against blemishes. But overall, it&#x27;s only a non-oily moisturizer. If you&#x27;re looking for a nice moisturizer than this is a good choice, but don&#x27;t expect any other benefits from.this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for over two months now, and I can definitely see a difference. My skin is brighter and my acne scars have almost faded completely. I love it! I even bought a bottle for my 15 year old, who struggles with acne.</li>
    <li> This is my first time writing a review, I think it&#x27;s worth mentioning. It works for dark spots and uneven skin tone but it takes time. I have been using it for 3+ weeks now. Wrinkles, need to wait and see. Will def buy again.</li>
    <li> I had no problems and fast shipping</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I&#x27;ve only been using it for about two weeks but within the first two days I could notice a difference under my eyes which is strange because I wasn&#x27;t deliberately applying it to that area. Somehow it helped and I didn&#x27;t need to wear concealer. I haven&#x27;t worn concealer since I started using this serum. I&#x27;m sure that over time the blemishes will fade and overall elasticity will improve.</li>
    <li> Excellent serum, love it, I got many compliments of my skin after using Eve Hansen Retinol 2.5, Rosehip Oil, and this Vitamin C, My lines less notice, dark spot and acne gone, skin looking younger. I feel so happy. Thanks for Eve Hansen great quality products. You are the best.</li>
    <li> I love my skin feel softly</li>
    <li> The delivery was fast. so I have been using it for a while. it is ok product. Goes really smooth and doesn&#x27;t have any strong medical smell. But I didn&#x27;t see results like the other users described- brighter, smoother skin, dark spots go away, etc..nothing of that kind. Just ok. If I could ask for my money back I probably would.</li>
    <li> Serum makes my face feel wonderful. Will order again from this company. Great products and SUPER FAST shipping.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I am 67 years old.  I have many wrinkles and many other issues on my face.  This vitamin c serum has helped elimate and tone down my wrinkles. It has helped the dark circles around my eyes.It has helped my face tremendously my whole complexion has been changed.  It has taken many years of wear and tear off of my face.  Thank you for sending me this product.  I Love it.</li>
    <li> Great product, great delivery and great packaging. Love it. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Nice serum.. I do see my face glowing a little bit</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for couple of weeks now, and I really enjoy it. It gives a boost to my skin in the morning and tightens it up. I use another facial cram afterwards.</li>
    <li> The serum is very light especially for the hot summer! I use it in the morning. Good to provide vitamins for the skin avoiding overwhelming!</li>
    <li> Love this. I use after doing my facial peels.  Also it&#x27;s very effective when use after the derma roll. Great but love it</li>
    <li> I tried it on one hand and not the other. NO CHANGE both hands look exactly the same to date. so it was a waste. did not notice a difference I used half of the bottle on my face as well daily. Not worth the money I waited and watched I even put it on one had every day and not the other and no change .</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this product as well as service and packaging! I will order from you again. Great product for a great price. I noticed results immediately after 1 application.</li>
    <li> Be careful with this.  It may cause breakouts if you have sensitive skin.  I should have known better as I had the same effect when I used Vitamin C face sprays from the Body Shop.  If you have sensitive skin and/or acne-prone skin, you might want to skip this one.  Maybe try using a retinol serum instead if you&#x27;re worried about fine wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical when I purchased this, however the product does not disappoint! I am in my mid 20s and have terrible acne scars all over my cheeks. I still break out so I was worried this would make my existing acne worse. After using the serum for about 3 weeks, my scars have faded dramatically! The scars have become less red, are flattened, and are reduced in size. The product hasn&#x27;t made my face break out any more than usual. This serum is great and I would recommend it for anyone suffering from acne scars! I have tried MANY products to get rid of my scars, however this serum is BY FAR the best!!</li>
    <li> I love this serum and will order again.</li>
    <li> Excellent! I love it !</li>
    <li> Thanks for Eve Hansen and amazon</li>
    <li> I was sent this product to review, aand through my personal experience I am very pleased with the results. This product is legitimately great. I couldnt believe it wotked on me so i also tried ut on my mother as well and she was instantly in love aftwrerhe first week. I would buy this item again and i know my mother is now a permanent buyer  thank you</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used the product very long.  I use it in the morning along with a different product in the evening.  I also use it on the top of my hands.  I will be 60 soon and want to keep my skin looking decent as long as I can.  I do notice an improvement on my hands.  My face has an improved appearance as well.</li>
    <li> This is the best vitamin c product I have found and I&#x27;ve tried many.  This one really works!</li>
    <li> As stated in my review for the Retinol serum, I LOVE these products.  I am using this Vitamin C serum, and the Retinol serum, and they do everything it says.  Not sticky, but absorbs into the skin.  Very pleasant smell.  It reminds me of vanilla.  This smoothes my complexion, and shrinks pores.  The best part is that it does not break me out, even in high heat and humidity.  It also evened out my skin tone.  I&#x27;m really thrilled with these products.  I&#x27;ve used everything, and I mean everything, from super high end to over the counter.  I&#x27;m sticking with this.  I highly recommend these products, and will be buying more soon.  Thank you Eve Hansen!!  Well done!!</li>
    <li> I think this product was worth it. It gave my skin an overall better appearance and my skin felt really soft. It helped with making scars fade faster and toned out my skin.</li>
    <li> Great Vitamin C Serum . Would Highly recommend Without exaggeration,&lt;br /&gt;The first time I put the Vitamin C Serum on my skin, it felt tight!</li>
    <li> Hi, so far it is working well. I also ordered some CoQ10 serum fr amazon and it feels pretty thick. I am using them along wi hydralaunic acid. So far the three are doing well! I don&#x27;t expect miracles but I&#x27;ll give it time!thank you!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product!!! I will be buying again!!!!</li>
    <li> Been using this for about a week and just LOVE it. Feels so soft and silky on the skin without leaving sticky or oily residue. My skin looks brighter and more even. I am 25 and I have very red, uneven skin tone on my face and arms. This product has already begun to show results. Also love the large size bottle! Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> didnt seea difference</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get any noticeable results using this serum, and I applied it every day.&lt;br /&gt;The best Vitamin C for your skin is in the form of L-Ascorbic acid. I didn&#x27;t realize that that was the the best form until doing a lot of research online. That form is pricey, some companies charge upwards of $75 for a 1 oz tube. Once Vitamin C is exposed to air it looses it&#x27;s potency. Because of this, the ideal way to store the serum is in a pump bottle. Each time you open the Eve Hansen bottle some of the effectiveness is lost.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve now started making my own toner. I use the Eve Hansen bottle, which is the right color (amber) to make sure minimal light reaches the vitamin (which breaks it down).&lt;br /&gt;I order L-Ascorbic powder from Amazon, along with pH strips. The pH has to be between 3 and 4 to work on the skin. I mix about one tablespoon of distilled water (must be distilled, available at grocery/drug stores for about $1) and less than 1/8 of a teaspoon of the L-Ascorbic powder. I have a pill grinder that I use to grind the powder down super fine, which makes it a lot easier to dissolve. The tonic lasts for about two days, maybe three, although it can be made in larger batches. I make small amounts because of the dropper, which exposes the toner to air.&lt;br /&gt;It can also be made with vegetable glycerin to make a serum.&lt;br /&gt;Making this the way I do costs maybe $20 each year. It works, and works well. Google DIY vitamin C serum and you&#x27;ll find a ton of recipes and reviews.</li>
    <li> Great product and customer service!</li>
    <li> I have red bags under my eyes.  I have tried everything to help with them. Creams do nothing and makeup won&#x27;t cover them.  I gave this four stars for now because after a few days it seems to be ridding me of the red bags. Since I have found things in the past that worked for at first and then stopped, I will update the review after a few weeks.</li>
    <li> I love my purchase! It did arrive earlier than expected very well packaged! Highly recommend it! I am so ready to start seeing its results! Great seller, thank you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using vitamin c serums for quite a while now and recently ordered this one. The size is bigger and lasts longer, there&#x27;s no weird smell, and it feels nice and clean going on my skin. I&#x27;d reccommend this product to anyone who&#x27;s trying to fight the aging process and get beautiful skin! I love it!</li>
    <li> I have been using Eve Hansen&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum for a month now.  I have one dark spot on my face and it has lightened by 50% since I started using the serum!  To say that I am thrilled would be an understatement.  I did not expect to see this kind of result so quickly.  I also have a dark spot on the back of my hand which has lightened by 35%.  I attribute this to getting my hands wet and not reapplying the serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply the Vitamin C Serum twice a day, morning and night.  It is milky in color, odorless and dries clear.  Once dry, it&#x27;s not sticky or tacky, it leaves your skin feeling smooth.  I was using this only on my dark spots and Eve Hansen&#x27;s Rosehip Oil all over my face.  This week, I started using the serum on the rest of my face along with the oil.  The serum and oil work very well together.  I use their Rosehip Oil because it has helped with the dry patches on my face plus I love the way my skin feels.  These are two of my must haves!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Eve Hansen for making such high quality products.  Debi B.</li>
    <li> wow! gorgeous product and super good seller. I have tried this vitamin C first time today and I love it! it is light and not greasy feelings on my skin, what is important for my very oily acne prone skin. Will order again for sure.</li>
    <li> my skin feels softer and smoother within days of using!</li>
    <li> Retinol and Vitamin C is a winning combination. Before trying this product, I was having problem with hormonal acne around my chin area. Since trying this now for 2-3 weeks. I no longer have acne there. My skin loves this serum! I put on the Retinol and Vitamin C and Hyaluronic serum every night and in the morning I put on the Vitamin C and Hyaluronic before my moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s going to be my beauty regimen from now on! Love this brand and product. Thanks for the reviews, I&#x27;m glad I tried this serum.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff ,I use it at night and in the morning I&#x27;m 24 and before i started using this I already looked 16, so this is just icing on the cake!!! . its not sticky or oily so that&#x27;s also a plus !! . when i&#x27;m done using it on my face i rub the rest in my hands and even my hands are looking different . The stuff in this bottle is definitely some magical sorcery !!  You immediately notice a difference you just gotta stick with it. but with everything in life consistency is key !!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m using this serum for last couple of months n my skin looks shiny n clean.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this vitamin C serum for a little while I honestly haven&#x27;t noticed any changes&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep using it and hopefully some magic will happen I will update In a month or 2</li>
    <li> Seems to be working just fine, it&#x27;s not sticky or messy to use and dries in completely.</li>
    <li> Worth every penny!!  My anesthetician couldn&#x27;t believe the results.</li>
    <li> Nice texture and although I can&#x27;t say I look years younger, my skin is amazing after a week.</li>
    <li> I love Eve Hansen&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum.  It is the third time I have purchased it and it lasts about 2 1/2 to 3 months..  I apply one coat massaging it into my face and neck,  wait a few minutes, and apply a second coat.  I do this every morning .  I can actually feel my skin tighten up.  After which I apply sunscreen or moisturizer, depending on the weather, and then my makeup.  I have experimented with all types of serums, for years, and I have finally found the one for me.</li>
    <li> This is the good stuff. I&#x27;m going to keep on it. I&#x27;ll be reordering soon at exactly the same place</li>
    <li> Fantastic product at a great low price. Superior to products much more expensive. Would like to try other products from this company.</li>
    <li> Only started using this in combo with hyaluronic acid a couple weeks ago, but seems great</li>
    <li> I brought this with the Retinol by Eve Hansen. Together I think the products do what they are supposed to do. My face is brighter and that&#x27;s all I really wanted. Also, these bottles are very generous for the price.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product.  She puts it on twice a day and sees results.&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied and would buy again.Very generous size bottle.</li>
    <li> For the price I paid and the quality of the product, I highly recommend this Vitamin C serum to anyone who has lack of collagen issues. Though I have been using sleeping cream with Hyaluronic acid it was not completely better. using Vitamin C diligently for few weeks I noticed that my skin does not have fine wrinkle which has diminished dramatically and also have more elasticity. I will continue to use this product and I am willing to try HA serum along with it to boost the effect.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying other products for about 5 months now.  I decided to try this after reading reviews.  OMG!!! I couldn&#x27;t believe anything could work like this.  I read post on ladies reviewing facial skin care products all the time that say &amp;#34;my skin feels so soft&amp;#34;.  Until I put this on my face I always thought that women saying that were full of nonsense !!!  I&#x27;m not a girly&#x27;girl but I see the age on my face at 44 and I do not like it!!! I have very old acne scars, about 3 small brown spots and fine lines around forehead - eyes and some starting on my face.  With my face beginning to loose it&#x27;s firmness (jowls sagging/frown starting at corners of mouth) I seek honest users of products with reviews to help with my concerns! Well, I know every product will not work for everyone - but I also know there are a lot that post fake reviews, or simply supply positive reviews to get free products - THAT&#x27;S NOT ME - I PAID FOR MINE AND FOR ME - FOR THE FIRST TIME I&#x27;VE HAVE EVER SAID THIS...MY SKIN FELT SOOOOO SMOOTH AFTER I PUT THIS ON! FIRST TIME I&#x27;VE EVER HAD THAT EXPERIENCE TO EVEN KNOW WHAT THE TERM MENT!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE IT AND IN THE HOPES IT MAY BE THE ANSWER FOR OTHERS - I&#x27;LL SAY BUY IT AND TRY IT!!!</li>
    <li> Sorcery in a bottle! It works. This isn&#x27;t magic or voodoo, to see results you have to use consistently as directed.</li>
    <li> Now after some time using this product i can say i&#x27;m totally satisfied with the experience with this seller as well as with the product. My skin is smooth and has got a glow back. It applies smoothly because of its silky texture and my skin absorbs it completely. I use it morning and evening and my lines are fading. I can feel under my fingers that a crow feet lines aren&#x27;t that deep any more.This was my second purchase from that seller and again i was happy with their service. Everything was on time, well packed and they contacted me to make sure delivery went with no problem. Good seller!!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an avid supporter of Eve Hansen products and the Vitamin C serum is amazing. With just the right amount of hyaluronic acid, this product is nothing short of a high end salon treatment. In 2 weeks, you will see a big difference in the texture of your skin. Fine lines, wrinkles and spots will fade. Your skin will feel soft and supple. There are a lot of Vitamin C/ Hyuralonic serums out there for a reason. The two ingredients work. The difference with Eve Hansen products is that hands down, the quality of these products is superior. This serum has a wonderful consistency and smells clean and fresh when you open the bottle. You cannot beat the value either. For less money, you are getting 4 ounces of product. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> very good and makes your face feel very soft while it repairs and decreases find lines wrinkles and dark spits. very well priced also. Vitamin C should be in every womans beauty regimen. throw out those over priced store brand junk filled with perfumes and alcohol that will do more harm to your skin than good plus rip your money off. go all natural:) that goes for the I dimer ial products too. trust me I&#x27;ve used it all snd since going all natural serums with NO ANIMAL TESTING my skin has never felt and looked so young..I&#x27;m going to be 52 next month and im always told I look like early thirties :) :) :)</li>
    <li> OMG this stuff is addicting the more you use it the more your skin craves it and you feel the difference.  I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with the consistency of this serum. It certainly is not thin and&lt;br /&gt;liquidy. It is just the right thickness. Nice larger bottle too. It has a nice feel on my face; absorbs well.</li>
    <li> My daughter referred your serum to me.  A few days later she sent me the link to get the product on a sale price.  I ordered and it was at my doorstep, regular shipment price, in just a couple of days.  I like the product and it was exactly what was shown.  I have since found more data on the importance of Vitamin C to get your face back.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> I use this vitamin C serum with the Hyaluronic Acid and the 2.5% retinol serum in combination and find my skin looks and feels great. The results are better than what I got with an expensive prescription cream and my skin feels better with this combo. Really great value for money and the results are equal to or better than any expensive beauty cream I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried plenty. I would recommend this brand to anyone, the quality is the same as the other brands of serum I&#x27;ve used, but this Eve Hansen brand gives you twice as much, a 2oz bottle, for the same $ or less than competing brands.</li>
    <li> Good product that delivers the benefits it&#x27;s meant to deliver. It brightens and tightens your skin. I found its less rigid on my skin if it&#x27;s splashed with a mist prior to applying the serum. Very satisfied</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now. I don&#x27;t know if I notice a whole lot of different look wise with my skin, but it does feel a lot smoother. So that&#x27;s good I guess! I bought it mostly to use on my eyes, and I think it has helped the dark circles but I&#x27;ve also changed my face wash and scrub so there&#x27;s a lot going on there. I slather it on in the AM and PM after I wash my face. I&#x27;m only 29 so my skin isn&#x27;t too bad but I&#x27;m hoping to prevent issues in the future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this serum for 1.5 weeks so its hard to notice any effects yet. Reason I docked several stars is the poor bottle packaging its in. I took this bottle with me on a trip and it leaked a bit in my toiletry bag. I thought it was because I didn&#x27;t close it well, so I just screwed it shut again. Traveled to another hotel and low and behold...... it opened again and all of it leaked out.&lt;br /&gt;Buyers beware! Don&#x27;t travel with this bottle as it leaks and doesn&#x27;t seal well. As for the serum itself, time will tell.</li>
    <li> I have only had this for a week now, but so far I love it. It&#x27;s simple to use and the texture of my skin is already better. I only use it every other dfay because I have sensitive skin. I am working up to daily use.The product arrived on time and in excellent condition. I was also emailed instructions from the seller as well as helpful information about the product. Great customer service!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pleased with the results from the serum. I put a half dropperful in my palm and smooth it on my face. It&#x27;s liquidy so that&#x27;s my method. I have been using it as instructed with hyroulonic gel and my skin keeps looking better.</li>
    <li> Worsest product i want my money back didnt do crap after usiing it faithfully.</li>
    <li> The serum has a silky feel, absorbs quickly, and leaves my complexion with a lovely glow. The bottle is also quite large, and  I got a bargain when comparing similar serums from other product lines.</li>
    <li> Seems to make my face feel more moisturized .. and possibly a little younger ...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen no difference</li>
    <li> I still have yet to use it for over a week but I love how hydrating and smooth it is. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong Odor of any chemicals but it does have this distinct smell of nature you could say. The smell isn&#x27;t something chemical or anything that you can smell unless you sniff it so it was ok.my sentences aren&#x27;t necessarily composed properly but hey moral of the story is I like the shine and glow it gives to my face and it is hydrating as hell. I use it in combination with a Korean cream called mizon so it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> So far I like the product- good size for the money, Dark glass bottle to keep the serum fresh, feels smooth, with no offensive fragrance added. If I see results when this bottle is empty, I will definitely purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Not sure if I see much difference, my skin (african american) is brighter...I think.  Didn&#x27;t make me break out as most serums do.  Will update!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oct 13, 2015:&lt;br /&gt;I realized I never provided an update.  I am impressed with this Vitamin C Serum.  There is a noticeable difference in the evenness of my skin tone and certainly the smoothness of my skin.  I can even seem the lines around my mouth and under my eyes have softened.  I&#x27;ve read some reviews where people received complimentary bottles - I did not.  I say that only to assure you that my review is unbiased.  The serum works well if you give it time!</li>
    <li> I love this product and will order more as needed!</li>
    <li> Like the feel of this serum on my skin. Running an experiment on my hands. Left hand gets the serum, right does not. I think I&#x27;m seeing a difference but waiting to see if there is more dramatic difference in the month to come. Face looks brighter. Will update this review later. I also bought a Vitamin C toner and a Vitamin C facial moisture cream.</li>
    <li> Love it. Will reorder</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been on a Vitamin C serum regimen ever since the start of the winter, when my skin tends to dry out and get oily (thanks to central heating).  I went around looking for the best quality and quantity for the price and decided on purchasing this one by Eve Hansen, and I have to say, I am very pleased with my product.  My skin issues have been minimized to the furthest possible degree, and the large size and concentration of the Vitamin C serum from this brand has lasted me a long time.  Vitamin C is essential for skin care in my case, and I would definitely recommend this brand to others who have similar issues.</li>
    <li> Its the best i will order for my daughter one plus vit A i love it</li>
    <li> I have been using it for about 2 weeks now and my skin feels great :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great I noticed right away the difference in my skin..</li>
    <li> The first thing that I noticed is that this has no scent which is a good thing in my opinion for facial care products. The next is that it was very thin. I did have to use a few extra drops than the 3-5 it suggests but the bottle is rather large and should last a long time. As I put it on it was a little sticky until it dried but this only lasted for less than 30 seconds. Neither of these would deter me from buying the product just would have like to have known myself. It did make my skin feel softer and smoother after using it just a few times. I am using this as a preventative to fine lines and wrinkles as I am in my late 20&#x27;s and as of now do not have too many of either of those. Vitamin C is proven to improve collagen production though and with the other ingredients that are so great for your skin like the hyaluronic acid, vitamin e, aloe, witch hazel and more I don&#x27;t see how you can go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free or reduced price in exchange for my honest opinion as seen above.</li>
    <li> This serum comes in a good size bottle.  It feels smooth going on my skin and has a very mild, light fragance.I love that it&#x27;s vegan and mostly organic.  Also, vitamin C is the third ingredient listed, unlike some other serums I&#x27;ve tried which list vitamin C as the last ingredient.  I&#x27;m all about a good vitamin C serum! I received this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> I like this vitamin c serum I used it for my face, neck and hands.</li>
    <li> I received my order as expected. I use my Clarisonic to cleanse and exfoliate my face, neck and decollete. After using the Vitamin C Serum the first night the following morning my skin looked so radiate, glowing !!! I use the Vitamin C Serum morning and night and will be ordering many more bottles of Vitamin C Serum.</li>
    <li> Very light and has improved my skin in just a few weeks!!! Can&#x27;t wait to see long terms effects.</li>
    <li> I love this! Since I started this regimen, I actually go out without make up.&lt;br /&gt;A must buy.</li>
    <li> Love the way my skin feels after i put this on. I&#x27;m 28 and i love taking care of my skin specially my face. My face looks smother, tighten n healthy. Luv it</li>
    <li> So far the product is a go! I like that it contains vit c, hyaluronic acid, n collagen enhancing ingredients. Ive noticed it diminish lines around my mouth n has also added a healthy glow. Its a product that is providing an all around need for what I was looking for! :-)</li>
    <li> I like it so far!  My skin hasn&#x27;t been breaking out as much and I definitely haven&#x27;t had any negative reactions to it :)  Will continue using it and see how it goes!</li>
    <li> LOVE  IT,  ONLY  WISH  I  HAD  5  OZ  INSTEAD  OF  TWO,  HOWEVER  DARRYL  IS  SATISFIED</li>
    <li> I enjoy the serum, look forward to purchase again. Great Results</li>
    <li> Great product!&lt;br /&gt;A little too watery... But it works great, you see results inmediately.</li>
</ol>
