      <li>I have been using this shampoo for more than 6 months now and it wasn&#x27;t until about after four months of continuous use (again, coupled with the oral Biotin)</li>
      <li>Fortunately, Amazon to the rescue!</li>
      <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t smell clean after I shower!</li>
      <li>Really does a nice job making hair feel thicker.</li>

      <li>but i needed that because my hair is usually very greasy.</li>
      <li>If you have an oily scalp this works really well.  </li>
      <li>Have used other products with similar claims but have not been as pleased as with this one.</li>

<ol>
    <li> It&#x27;s cool for my hair.</li>
    <li> Guess it works when the hair is not dry. It dries your hair a bit.</li>
    <li> no effect was found up to now.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that the ingredients are organic and nothing artificial has been added.  However upon use, it is rather drying - you must use a conditioner for this product unless your hair is greasy.</li>
    <li> When I received this shampoo, I have because there is no packaging intact, all spread out, are spread over a bottle and dirty along with other toys to buy, very disappointed</li>
    <li> A great poo.  Really refreshing and does not take a lot to lather up.  I would rather have this stuff than anything else I could buy at the store.  Well worth the slight extra cost.  A treat!</li>
    <li> Has a great smell, and my hair really does feel thicker.  I will continue to use and buy.&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this shampoo.  I am a mature (aka getting old) woman who is suffering from thinning hair.  I have been taking Biotin tablets as part of a daily regimen for nearly two years and I found that it helped somewhat.  When I discovered this shampoo and combined it with the oral Biotin, the results were very noticeable.  Please don&#x27;t think you will see changes overnight.  I have been using this shampoo for more than 6 months now and it wasn&#x27;t until about after four months of continuous use (again, coupled with the oral Biotin) that I saw changes.  My hair has grown a little thicker, but more importantly, it has stopped falling out.  Praise God and Avalon Organics.</li>
    <li> I have tried Thickening Shampoo several times over the years and Avalon Organics  makes a super product that thickens my hair but does not leave it dry and unmanageable.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Not 100% organic. It contain Sodium Sulfate&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo according to the label contain many natural and herbal ingredients which are very beneficial to the hair and scalp. IT ALSO CONTAIN SODIUM SULFATE.&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised to see on the label stating that 70% organic ingredients and the remaining not organic!&lt;br /&gt;The downside for me to not use this shampoo in the long term is that it also contain two more chemicals unknown to me including sodium sulfate and for that reason along, I will not order it gain.&lt;br /&gt;If I know from the beginning that it would contain SLS and few other chemicals, I would have not ordered this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I will do it short; this is my second time using this product. My first time I was amazed and gave it 5 stars . This is my second one and so sorry, it does not fill the same. I even read some other reviews that pointing that the ingredients has been change. So baddddd. Why?</li>
    <li> Really does a nice job making hair feel thicker. I love the scent too!</li>
    <li> I love it, it really cleans the scalp well just with a dime size of shampoo.  My hair is shoulder length.  If you have an oily scalp this works really well.  However, for me, I use a leave in conditioner afterwards to continue to make my hair soft.</li>
    <li> I discovered this product initially at a Meijer store and really liked it. The organic ingredients, biotin, and saw palmetto are what  attracted me to this product  and that it had much less chemical content and no SLS. It works well and leaves my hair soft and easy to style. Of course, after wanting to repurchase the product at the store, it was discontinued at Meijer. Fortunately, Amazon to the rescue!</li>
    <li> Been using different shampoo just to find which better for my hair &#x27;coz it&#x27;s getting thinner, then I see this tries so far am happy for the result but it&#x27;s still falling but not that much unlike before.</li>
    <li> smells okay. it does dry out my hair but i needed that because my hair is usually very greasy.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair that has gotten curly with age.  This shampoo is great.  It gives me volume without drying it out.  I have been using this brand for over a year now and hope they continue to make it as I don&#x27;t want to have to switch to anything else!</li>
    <li> Not sure if its worked. Been using it since the summer.</li>
    <li> Really like this product. Works well for thinning hair and also has a really pleasant smell, not overpowering. Have used other products with similar claims but have not been as pleased as with this one.</li>
    <li> It works fine but the smell isn&#x27;t as good as I would like. My hair doesn&#x27;t smell clean after I shower! But I do feel like it&#x27;s helped my hair a little</li>
    <li> Very drying to the hair. I had to stop using since it has dried out my hair so bad. It did help with minimizing the hair fallout.</li>
    <li> delivery service was so bad!!&lt;br /&gt;my shampoo bottle was open and 1/5 was leaked!!!</li>
