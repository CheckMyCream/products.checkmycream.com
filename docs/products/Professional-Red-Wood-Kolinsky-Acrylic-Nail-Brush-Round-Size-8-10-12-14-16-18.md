    <li> Shorter hairs just not for me, but quality is good great shipping</li>

    <li> very professional and good quality brush</li>
    <li> Ok so I recieved my brush pretty fast. The only thing is I used it 2x and it started shedding I am so disappointed because I have been thru so many brushes and I thought this would be the on but no it sheds bad!</li>
    <li> I got the nail brush and it is a professional brush worth the price I love it and work great</li>
    <li> It helped with the shaping of the acrylic, but it was too bulky. I should have purchased a size 14 or 12.</li>
    <li> Well worth the money.  It has made all the difference in my nails!</li>
    <li> Its perfect. So soft . Very good quality</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my brush. Not only is it a high quality brush. It came in before the expected dilivery date. It was very nicely wrapped and packed. Also the seller took the time to write a thank you note. And I was able to track it (: I got size 16 and since I&#x27;m just learning how to do acrylics at first I would get acrylic all over my skin but now I got the hang of it. But I still kinda wish I would have gotten size 14 instead . Overall this brush is amazing the acrylic doesn&#x27;t get stuck in between the bristles which makes the process even easier . I highly recommend it. And the price is very affordable for a brush so high in quality</li>
    <li> This is just wonderful, finally an acrylic brush that is a perfect size and fit for my hand.  I wish i had these in school when i started out, i love working with it, and it keeps its shape so well!  I will be buying more of these in the future rest assured.</li>
    <li> Awesome brush. Doesn&#x27;t get goopy or stiff.</li>
    <li> Great brush , very nicely made. With no shedding !!</li>
    <li> great brush .worked well to shape nails</li>
    <li> This brush is a good size for acrylic application. It also is light on the wrist &amp; it cleans well. Good product for a decent price.</li>
    <li> Love this brush! It is well worth the money. Just the brush itself makes a difference when doing acrylic nails</li>
    <li> This brush in any size is truly good quality. I own the 16y and 18 and both of them work well. I gave it four stars because occasionally a bristle will come out but not often. This brush doesn&#x27;t swell like my other cheap ones did. It holds its shape quite well through out the acrylic application process.</li>
