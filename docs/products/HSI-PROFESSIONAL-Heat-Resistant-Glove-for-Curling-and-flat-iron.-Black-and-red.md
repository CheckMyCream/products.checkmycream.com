### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Works great!</li>
      <li>This product is wonderful!!</li>
      <li>They work wonderfully!</li>
      <li>LOL!</li>
      <li>Sent it as a gift, but I heard it worked great!</li>
      <li>I had an excellent experience ordering them.</li>
      <li>They worked great!</li>
      <li>Excellent product, good service.</li>
      <li>The gloves arrived promptly and packed beautifully.  </li>
      <li>My daughter says these are great to use with her wand.</li>
      <li>they work great</li>
      <li>its great...</li>
      <li>They work great....</li>
      <li>They work great.</li>
      <li>I am so happy that I was able to find something that prevented me from burning my hands!</li>
      <li>Great product fast shipping and good price.</li>
      <li>The glove was okay.</li>
      <li>i love it ...</li>
      <li>so I enjoyed the heat that came through the gloves.</li>
      <li>but it does a better job than the gloves my wand came with</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say how much I love these.</li>
      <li>What a joy to not worry about EITHER hand getting burned with my new Sultra Wand where I must wrap the hair around the wand.  </li>
      <li>These gloves aren&#x27;t as good as the one I received when I purchased an amika curler; these are made with a much thinner material.</li>
      <li>its easilly easy to work ...</li>
      <li>I also hold the warm hair that was just curled in my hand for several seconds after I take it out of the curling iron so to set the curl more, therefore the gloves come in handy for that also.</li>
      <li>These things are huge.  </li>
      <li>These gloves are cheaply sewn.</li>
      <li>I lost the original glove that came with my curling iron</li>
      <li>They came quickly, and do save on burns.  </li>
      <li>Also, arrived fairly quickly.</li>
      <li>There is a bit of adjustment since you can&#x27;t really feel your hair, but it is easy to get used to.</li>
      <li>What was I thinking when I thought bobbed straight hair was going to be easy?</li>
      <li>My hands can still get warm but they have definitely kept me from getting burned!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few gloves, so as not to burn my fingers while using my curling wand and find this one to work best, by far.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re using this with a curling iron, which it looks like most people are, you&#x27;d have to be applying your gloved hand directly to the curling iron on the hottest setting for probably 15-20 seconds before it&#x27;d be too hot.</li>
      <li>They really do make styling your hair a lot easier since you don&#x27;t have to worry about burning your hands with a very hot curling iron, etc.  </li>
      <li>You should not be grabbing a curling iron at all for any reason on the hot part.</li>
      <li>I love the fact that there are two gloves, for the same price as 1.</li>
      <li>However, these gloves are cheap and protect my skin from the heat relatively well.</li>
      <li>I am very amused by the reviews saying these are not 100% heat resistant...</li>
      <li>These really help to protect me from branding my hands as I learn to use my straightener/curling iron.</li>
      <li>Love how much longer they are than any other glove I found.</li>
      <li>No longer, that is why I bought two, left and right!</li>
      <li>Kind of bulky and its hard to hold on to your hair when wearing them.</li>
      <li>Other than that they are fine.</li>
      <li>I curl my daughters long hair often, and would touch  my hands and fingers with the Iron,&lt;br /&gt;or hot curlers!</li>
      <li>This glove replaced my old one, my hands are no longer being burned when I curl my hair.</li>
      <li>If you use these like a normal human being, you will not burn your hands, which is what these gloves are for.</li>
      <li>I thought I had large hands for a female (who I feel these are geared towards) but they are way too big for me.  </li>
      <li>The down side is they fit loosely and make the hair a bit frizzy.</li>
      <li>Completely useless, although I think the quality is nice</li>

<li> Faster having gloves on both hands so your brain doesn&#x27;t have to switch gears, switch glove to other hand when doing opposite side of your head early in the morning.</li>
<li> Works well with my flat iron</li>
<li> I bought these gloves to use for the flat iron part of applying a keratin treatment to my hair.</li>
<li> It did reduce the heat on my hand that when I was holding tip of my flat iron.</li>
<li> But it&#x27;s more difficult than expected to section hair with these on...</li>
<li> It fit, but made it kinda difficult to use the flat iron the way I wanted.</li>
<li> /&gt;Trying to use a curling wand while wearing both was very tricky and made me feel clumsy.</li>
<li> The fingers are almost too long for mine and I have long fingers.</li>
<li> They work by keeping fingers from getting burnt; however gloves material stretch and are very loose...</li>
<li> Heat resistant glove performs as expected.</li>
<li> Absolutely no issues with burns, as I found with other brands.</li>
<li> Using the gloves slowed down my usual curling process because I had to constantly tell myself pre-coffee to use the gloved hand.</li>
<li> If you wear a small these gloves may run big and if big difficult to use with flat iron.</li>
<li> I think they could be a little thicker.</li>
<li> I have used the gloves a few times.  </li>
<li> No more burned fingers!</li>
<li> No more burns on my finger tips!</li>
<li> They get in the way and a firm grip on the hair and roller cannot be achieved:-(</li>
<li> what a ridiculous expectation!!</li>
<li> My fingers were really cold to begin with</li>
<li> I had to get something after burning the crap out of my thumb and finger.</li>

    <li> This product is wonderful!! I curl my daughters long hair often, and would touch  my hands and fingers with the Iron,&lt;br /&gt;or hot curlers! No longer, that is why I bought two, left and right! The product&lt;br /&gt;arrived promptly!!</li>
    <li> My niece loves that she doesn&#x27;t get burned anymore by her styling equipment.</li>
    <li> They work great. I think they could be a little thicker. My hands can still get warm but they have definitely kept me from getting burned!</li>
    <li> I always burn my fingers when using a curling wand...these prevent that. But it&#x27;s more difficult than expected to section hair with these on...I guess just because you can&#x27;t feel through them. The fingers are almost too long for mine and I have long fingers. Other than that they are fine. I may use them from time to time.</li>
    <li> No more burns on my finger tips!</li>
    <li> Works well with my flat iron</li>
    <li> its great... i love it ... you will not burn your hand with it... its easilly easy to work ...</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t protect from the heat but it does a better job than the gloves my wand came with</li>
    <li> Kind of bulky and its hard to hold on to your hair when wearing them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few gloves, so as not to burn my fingers while using my curling wand and find this one to work best, by far. Absolutely no issues with burns, as I found with other brands. There is a bit of adjustment since you can&#x27;t really feel your hair, but it is easy to get used to. Should anything happen, I&#x27;d replace it with the same product.</li>
    <li> Great product fast shipping and good price.</li>
    <li> The gloves arrived promptly and packed beautifully.  What a joy to not worry about EITHER hand getting burned with my new Sultra Wand where I must wrap the hair around the wand.  The wand only comes with one glove.  Faster having gloves on both hands so your brain doesn&#x27;t have to switch gears, switch glove to other hand when doing opposite side of your head early in the morning.</li>
    <li> I love the fact that there are two gloves, for the same price as 1. They work wonderfully!</li>
    <li> The glove was okay. It fit, but made it kinda difficult to use the flat iron the way I wanted. The glove felt bulky, and my hair would catch on it every time I flipped it. It did reduce the heat on my hand that when I was holding tip of my flat iron.</li>
    <li> Love how much longer they are than any other glove I found.</li>
    <li> These keep your hands from getting burnt...They work great....</li>
    <li> They came quickly, and do save on burns.  The down side is they fit loosely and make the hair a bit frizzy. It helped me learn how to use the curling wand without getting burned, so it served its purpose.</li>
    <li> Sent it as a gift, but I heard it worked great!</li>
    <li> I bought these gloves to use for the flat iron part of applying a keratin treatment to my hair. They worked great!</li>

However, these gloves are cheap and protect my skin from the heat relatively well.</li>
    <li> The gloves are a one size fits all which is a challenge with gloves. If you wear a small these gloves may run big and if big difficult to use with flat iron. Material feels inexpensive.</li>
    <li> they work great and I dont burn my hands anymore</li>
    <li> These gloves are cheaply sewn. The two I ordered had a number of strings inside of them, and the colored stitching around the wrist is already coming off after wearing them once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trying to use a curling wand while wearing both was very tricky and made me feel clumsy. Using the gloves slowed down my usual curling process because I had to constantly tell myself pre-coffee to use the gloved hand. They protect your fingers from getting burned for about 5 seconds, and then you start to feel the burn through the glove.</li>
    <li> I had to get something after burning the crap out of my thumb and finger. These really help to protect me from branding my hands as I learn to use my straightener/curling iron. LOL! What was I thinking when I thought bobbed straight hair was going to be easy?</li>

    <li> I am very amused by the reviews saying these are not 100% heat resistant... what a ridiculous expectation!!

If you are doing this, YOU ARE USING A CURLING IRON INCORRECTLY!!!! You should not be grabbing a curling iron at all for any reason on the hot part. If you use these like a normal human being, you will not burn your hands, which is what these gloves are for.</li>
    <li> OMG! Finally don&#x27;t burn the tips of my fingers...daily. Can&#x27;t say how much I love these. Must admit I found them by accident while I was looking for something else. The gloves are TERRIFIC!!!</li>
    <li> These feel like regular gloves. When  I curl my hair, I can still feel the heat through the gloves even after just a couple seconds.</li>
    <li> Heat resistant glove performs as expected. No more burned fingers!</li>
    <li> This glove replaced my old one, my hands are no longer being burned when I curl my hair. Also, arrived fairly quickly.</li>
    <li> These things are huge.  I thought I had large hands for a female (who I feel these are geared towards) but they are way too big for me.  I can not get a grasp of my hair as I wind it around my wand.  Completely useless, although I think the quality is nice (which is the only reason I gave it a second star).</li>
    <li> The gloves are not usefull the heat still passes through anyway</li>
