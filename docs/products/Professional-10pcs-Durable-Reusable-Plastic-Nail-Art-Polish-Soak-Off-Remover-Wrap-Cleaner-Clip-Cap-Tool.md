      <li>Worth buying for sure.</li>

      <li>I use pure acetone and they have held up just fine.</li>
      <li>It’s not a big deal to me, I just lay the cotton on top and its fine.</li>
      <li>Works great for people like me who are too impatient to soak their nails.</li>
      <li>These are actually fun.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s worth the wait.</li>
      <li>Someone gave me a tip to put the bowl of remover in a larger bowl of warm water</li>
      <li>Well worth the wait.</li>
      <li>These arrived in only a week for me, which I found surprising as many others had said they waited a long time for them.</li>
      <li>Cut cotton squares into quarters until you have the right number, add polish remover to squares.&lt;br /&gt;Set</li>
      <li>Then I do the 4 fingers on my right hand</li>
      <li>The plastic is pretty cheap, so I don&#x27;t think it will last very long, but for the price I&#x27;m happy.</li>
      <li>These seem like a great alternative to the traditional foil soak-off method, but they don&#x27;t fit snug enough to keep the cotton directly on the nail.  </li>
      <li>Harder to put on my own hands than the foil is.</li>
      <li>The clips worked exactly how they are described.  </li>
      <li>: I did this for about my first 20 home gel manicures.</li>

      <li>The first time I used these I waited 20 minutes then checked nails expecting them to be ready for removal...</li>
      <li>About $0.50 per manicure.&lt;br /&gt;-Bowl of acetone: It&#x27;s hard because you&#x27;re really stuck in one place for the whole time, but you just find a good TV show and you&#x27;re done in about 15 minutes.</li>
      <li>They are much easier than messing with foil.</li>
      <li>Had to manually hold the the cotton on the finger which was very tiring.</li>

    <li> I do gel nails for women in my family. I am not a professional.  I bought four packs. I use acetone on cotton. The first time I used these I waited 20 minutes then checked nails expecting them to be ready for removal...NOPE. COTTON WAS BONE DRY. I now put hands in quart size ziplock Baggie after applying clips, and these guys work great. I also fill up a shot glass with acetone and re-dip nails if I think it needs it. My mom, mother-in-love, daughter, and sons girlfriend all agree with me that they work. It was an up front purchase, but now in won&#x27;t need to buy foil. Very easy to check and reapply cotton if needed. I will not SCRAPE gel off of nails. I wait till gel is completely LOOSE. Got 4 stars because I have to use a Baggie, or they don&#x27;t work.  But each girl has twobaggies and not only reuse each time but also store personal clippers, files, buffers, and other things I just don&#x27;t like sharing, even with family!!</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Just put a cotton ball inside with soak off formula.</li>
    <li> These work great for holding cotton swabs on your nails. They are much easier than messing with foil.</li>
    <li> I would give it 10 stars if I could. Makes shellac and gel removal sooooo easy</li>
    <li> These babies are amazing! They work so much better and faster than the tin foil method of removing gel polish. They are easy to clip onto each finger. I do all 10 at a time and have no problems getting them attached. The only downfall is that my thumbs don&#x27;t fit well inside the clips. They still work, but I have to put them on at a little bit angled to get my thumb in them. I use pure acetone and they have held up just fine.</li>
    <li> These work perfectly!</li>
    <li> Tried these and they work great! Like it states, you leave them on for 10 minutes and then pull them off or take off and done. Highly recommend. Came early.</li>
    <li> Cut cotton squares into quarters until you have the right number, add polish remover to squares.&lt;br /&gt;Set timer for 10-15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Place soaked cotton over nails and cover with clips.&lt;br /&gt;Start timer.&lt;br /&gt;When timer goes off, simply wipe off anything left on the nails.</li>
    <li> foil would work but I got it so I will be using it.</li>
    <li> Shipment took 3(!) months, China- USA. Quality is not a long life one</li>
    <li> Must have , every salon owner &amp;nail tech .&lt;br /&gt;Save time &amp; money!</li>
    <li> These are Meh. I tried doing both hands simultaneously. Not a great idea unless you have a helper. It was still difficult keeping them in place and I think the acetone dried up much faster than with the foil method. The ones that work best for me are the foil squares that have the cotton attached. I just add the acetone. I can usually reuse them on my other hand.</li>
    <li> They work it just needs timing which I am not that patient but overall it works!</li>

    <li> Only received 9 clips and one of them was broken.</li>
    <li> This worked..it helped me soak off gel polish from my nails</li>
    <li> I received only 9 pieces in my set and one of the pieces was broken when it arrived, so now I have only 8 usable nail pieces. It was not professional or durable.</li>
    <li> What a great invention! Works perfectly.</li>
    <li> These are GREAT for soaking off Jamberries!</li>
    <li> works as intended--holds cotton balls on finger tips to help soak off polish.  hands aren&#x27;t usable when your doing it so I usually do one hand at a time.</li>
    <li> good set. liked it. much better than wrap nails in foil.</li>
    <li> I love these, but you get what you pay for.  One out of ten was broken upon arrival, but they&#x27;re still way better than foil and at an amazing price.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t hold tight enough. Foils work better.</li>
    <li> They come in handy and you can reuse. Worth buying for sure.</li>
    <li> These little guys have changed my life!  I do my own gel nails at home and have used the foil/cotton ball method for years.  These clamps make it so much easier to remove my gel polish.  Not only is it quicker, cleaner and less wasteful, my husband doesn&#x27;t have to help me wrap foil around my nails anymore (which he really appreciates).  These are great.  If you wear gel nail polish, they are a MUST HAVE!!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to receive these.  They are not the easiest to use, however.  The clips are not strong enough to stay on your fingers.  You have to sit really still while they are on or they will fall off.  Good idea though, just need a better product.</li>
    <li> Work well, and better than using aluminum foil</li>
    <li> These arrived in only a week for me, which I found surprising as many others had said they waited a long time for them. They are packaged in a nice ziplock plastic pack, and I absolutely love them. They are tight enough to get the job done when I have foil wraps around my gel nails, but not too tight that it cuts off my circulation. They are easy to put on, and I have already recommended a few other friends to purchase these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like gel nails but hate the process of taking them off, these will make your life so much easier!</li>
    <li> These seem like a great alternative to the traditional foil soak-off method, but they don&#x27;t fit snug enough to keep the cotton directly on the nail.  I tried them once and it took at least twenty minutes total to soak off; whereas it takes about 10 minutes with foil.  I don&#x27;t recommend these.  Stick with foil.</li>
    <li> I love doing my own gel nails, but removal is a pain. I’ve tried so many methods of getting my polish off, this is my favorite so far. It’s pretty self explanatory, but I’ll list the steps just in case anyone is curious:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Use coarse file to remove shine from gel nails.&lt;br /&gt;2. Take a cotton ball or two and tear it in 10 little pieces. I can get enough pieces out of one cotton ball, but it make take more if you have different size cotton balls. The pieces don’t need to be big.&lt;br /&gt;3. Saturate a small piece with acetone.&lt;br /&gt;4. Lay acetone soaked cotton ball on nail. It just needs to cover the whole nail, not be really thick.&lt;br /&gt;5. Open clip and place over nail. I make sure to open it all the way and place my finger all the way in before closing it. You don’t want the cotton ball to shift when putting your nail in, so don’t let the top part touch until it’s in place.&lt;br /&gt;6. I do my left hand and right pointer finger first. That way for the 10-15 minutes I can still do a few things with my right hand 4 fingers. Then I do the 4 fingers on my right hand and I have my pointer finger done so I can type or do simple tasks.&lt;br /&gt;7. Leave on for 10+ minutes. I don’t like scraping anything, so I usually do 15 minutes and the polish just slides right off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is nearly impossible to do both hands at once by yourself. I gauge my time and how much I want to get done when figuring out how many fingers I want to do. I have 2 kids, so I don’t really have time to sit down for 30 minutes just to wait for my nails, not to mention another 30-45 minutes to do them again. Sometimes I do this while watching a movie at night and have my hubby help with the last few fingers. Or I do a few fingers at a time so I can play with the kids or do tasks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way this is the best method I&#x27;ve tried. I am listing the other methods I&#x27;ve done in order of best to worst. I will say the only downfall is that these don’t fit my big toe. It’s not a big deal to me, I just lay the cotton on top and its fine. I’m ordering another set for my backup and a set for my friend who just started doing her own gel nails. This is a really good price for what you’re getting! I very highly recommend this if you do your own gel nails or if you don’t want to pay a salon to take them off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a breakdown of each method I&#x27;ve tried. I listed them in order of the easiest to hardest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Nail clips (this product): As I mentioned above, this is the easiest way I’ve found.&lt;br /&gt;-Nail remover wraps: This is a little pouch, like an alcohol wipe if you’re familiar with that. You rip the top off, put your finger in and form it around your finger. This is a little more expensive and takes a bit longer to do. Just ripping the top on all of them and forming them takes about double the time as nail clips. I like that I can put the wraps on before I go somewhere (I used to do it during my daughter’s soccer practice) and I don’t have to bring anything extra. I paid about $10 for 200 of them. About $0.50 per manicure.&lt;br /&gt;-Bowl of acetone: It&#x27;s hard because you&#x27;re really stuck in one place for the whole time, but you just find a good TV show and you&#x27;re done in about 15 minutes. Someone gave me a tip to put the bowl of remover in a larger bowl of warm water so your fingers don&#x27;t get so cold. You can also pour the acetone back in and reuse it a couple times.I still like the nail clips immensely better, but this way is good if you want to get it all done at once and quickly.&lt;br /&gt;-Finger plug things: Messy and annoying&lt;br /&gt;-Finger tray: Similar to a bowl of acetone, but its extra stuff to have lying around, hard to pour the acetone back in. It just seems easier to use a small bowl.&lt;br /&gt;-Foil and cotton balls: I did this for about my first 20 home gel manicures. Between ripping the foil, tearing the cotton into small pieces, and wrapping each finger, it was a BIG hassle. These nail clips are the same concept, but so much easier with less waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 year update: This is still my favorite method for removing my gel nails. I have learned a few tricks over the year, so hopefully I can make this even easier for you. I now use lint free wipes instead of cotton balls. It is so much easier to count out 10 of them, rather than pulling apart cotton balls. I got 900 of them for about $2 http://www.amazon.com/AllBeauty-Polish-Acrylic-Remover-Cleaner/dp/B00BY1ONX4?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&amp;redirect&#x3D;true&amp;ref_&#x3D;oh_aui_search_detailpage  I also got this http://www.amazon.com/Beauticom-ACETONE-Dispenser-Bottle-Labeled/dp/B00U8Q6TLU?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&amp;redirect&#x3D;true&amp;ref_&#x3D;oh_aui_search_detailpage which has been amazing. So now I just get my wipe, fold it in half and then in half again, so it&#x27;s 1/4 the size. I put it on the pump of the acetone bottle and pump the top until it&#x27;s saturated. I can&#x27;t even tell you how much simplier this has made my nail removal. I did break one of these clips and bought another set so I can do all my nails at once, but I often break it up in two. So I do 5 fingers at a time, not the right and first and then left hand. I always do my thumb and pointer finger on my dominant hand separately so I can still do a few things while I&#x27;m waiting for the polish to come off. Or if my husband is home I&#x27;ll do both hands and have him help me with the last few. I still highly recommend these clips. They are the best way I&#x27;ve found  to remove my nails.

    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these because they are cheaply made.  The springs don&#x27;t actually hold the cotton in place. They fall off of your fingers. Also they are made in China.</li>
    <li> These are great. I dab some remover on a cotton ball put it on my finger and clip this over it. Stays in place and for gel in 5 minutes I take it off and all of the gel has flaked off. Works great for people like me who are too impatient to soak their nails.</li>
    <li> These work well but hard to put on yourself.</li>
    <li> Works well to remove gel polish.  Awkward to use by yourself for all ten fingers.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re good but not very tight on the finger tips a little loose.</li>
    <li> The clips worked exactly how they are described.  I&#x27;m a newbie to gel nails and I wanted something a little easier then the tin foil method.  These worked great and stayed on my fingers with no issues.  Simple!</li>
    <li> The clamps work very good with holding the acetone soaked cotton balls on the fingertips however I received one that was broken. Had to manually hold the the cotton on the finger which was very tiring. After reporting the broken clamp to the vendor thru Amazon the vendor contacted me and asked if I wanted a refund or replacement. I chose replacement because the clamps held the cotton balls on top of the nails as desired. I just received the replacement in the mail today 3/2/15. I am pleased with this vendor&#x27;s resolution of this issue. Would purchase from this vendor again without hesitation.</li>
    <li> Harder to put on my own hands than the foil is.</li>
    <li> Great product. Makes glitter removal so much easier than cutting up foil squares!  Shipping does take a while though but it&#x27;s worth the wait.</li>
    <li> these are great so much easier than trying to wrap my own fingers in tinfoil when removing shellac from my nails.</li>
    <li> These are actually fun.  I do my own nails so it is a real challenge to get all 10 on my fingers. It held my soaked pads on the nails well.  I would recommend these.  It took a long time for me to receive these.</li>
    <li> Item performs as advertised!</li>
    <li> They work pretty good better then using tinfoil. Haven&#x27;t had any problems with them.</li>
    <li> They work just fine, nothing fancy.</li>
    <li> I like that these are reusable.  It is a little difficult to get them on both hands at the same time, but they work great.</li>
    <li> So much easier that cutting foil pieces and wrapping each nail. They don&#x27;t fit my big toes, so I still have to wrap those. No biggie, though!</li>
    <li> I simply love these.&lt;br /&gt;Use them with cotton pads rather than balls for a more secure fit over the nail.</li>
    <li> These work well. I prefer this to foil in my opinion but it&#x27;s impossible to do both hands by yourself. I received them in about 1.5 weeks.</li>
    <li> Love this nails tools. So easy to use and green. Deliver earlier than expect. Excellent.  order more. :)</li>
    <li> These are great and save cost on foil!</li>
    <li> Definitely easier than foil.  Just file off the clear coat, soak your cotton ball, put it on your finger and clip.  It&#x27;s really that easy. The plastic is pretty cheap, so I don&#x27;t think it will last very long, but for the price I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> These are a great way to avoid using a bunch of aluminum foil and trying to wrapped them on all of your fingers on your own. I put pure acetone on a cotton ball and used these to clamp them down onto my hands. I was able to do all 10 fingers at once. Still a little difficult but I always needed help when I had the aluminum on them. Only complain is that I had to really push down on these because my gel polish wasn&#x27;t coming off as fast as it did when i was able to wrap the aluminum nice and tight. Not a big deal, still worth it!</li>
    <li> These are great. They make taking gel polish off so much easier. Plus they&#x27;re adorable.</li>
    <li> I personally really like these for removing gel polish.  I just put part of a cotton ball on my fingernail, use a dropper to saturate it with 100% acetone remover and sit back for just however long I feel like it 15-20 usually.</li>
    <li> This is my second set.  I ordered them after trying them on my customers.  We at the salon liked them so well that I ordered 4 more sets for the other nail techs.  They are from China but got my shipment in less than 2 weeks.  Well worth the wait.</li>
    <li> Perfect for taking off my gel!! Love these !!</li>
    <li> Nice product,fast shipping!!!Thanks))</li>
