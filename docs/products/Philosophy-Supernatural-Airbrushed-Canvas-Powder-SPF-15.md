      <li>This is an Excellent product, although a Little \\&quot;drying\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>Lot of Companies coming out with this Airbrush Minerals, Including Nuetragena, and Loreal , all available cheaper at CVS or drug Stores.  </li>
      <li>I have light skin, but the lighter powders always make me look like a ghost.</li>
      <li>Once the sponge runs out replacements are available.</li>
      <li>Smooth finish, although I still use a brush to &amp;#34;work it in&amp;#34;, the sponge applicator is sufficient.  </li>
      <li>Worth your money for sure.</li>
      <li>It is quick an easy to apply, though.  </li>
      <li>The powder is super easy to apply and it goes on like a veil.  </li>
      <li>I love this product, it covers very well and also protects never oily!</li>
      <li>I recently ordered this product, and I am loving it!  </li>
      <li>The color is also nice as it blends well with nearly any skin color.</li>
      <li>so it really is cheaper than most.  </li>
      <li>I like full coverage as I have freckles and rosacea, so</li>
      <li>the applicator makes it incredible, as i can put on a face in less than 10 minutes!  </li>
      <li>Great stuff, just like the other Philosophy products I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
      <li>Love, love, love this - especially the applicator which they no longer make :o(</li>
      <li>I tried it this morning, fresh moisturizer, primer..same result.  </li>
      <li>AND it is HALF full... instead go with dior forever from sephora, staight up awesome makeup and the same price.</li>
      <li>The coverage is unbelievable and makes my skin look great.</li>
      <li>I also bought the next shade up, bronze and honestly, cannot tell much difference.</li>
      <li>Amazon was willing to fix.  </li>
      <li>First class.</li>
      <li>I really like the Bronze color better since i am usually tan, but this product is just so easy to use.</li>
      <li>I Have Dry Skin, and it Drys It even More.</li>
      <li>Philosophy Supernatural Airbrush Canvas and would recommend it to anyone!</li>
      <li>I was really really like him</li>
      <li>When I put it on around my nose, every pore filled with the makeup and it was very obvious.  </li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t rub off and smudge in the water and also really helps provide sun protection.</li>
      <li>straight up do not buy.</li>
      <li>Supernatural is just that - super and natural.  </li>
      <li>I am sure you would not go back to your old product.</li>
      <li>I have used the supernatural airbrush for over 3 years now..</li>
      <li>The shipping cost made it even more expensive but sephora doesn&#x27;t carry it any more.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I loved the bare minerals, but wanted to try something less messy.</li>
      <li>Powder was inside and out and more than half of the bottle was empty (Beige color).  </li>
      <li>I have rosacea and it covers up the redness well without irritating, goes on easily too!</li>
      <li>i LOVE the applicator, and unlike some of the other mineral products i&#x27;ve used, this one doesnt give my skin a strange smell after i&#x27;ve worn it all day long.</li>
      <li>Needs no applicator - just dust over face for soft, natural, lasting coverage.  </li>
      <li>i use the bare essentials brushes to apply.</li>
      <li>have other powder foundations, Bare Escentials, and that works fine, so I am not sure why this one did not.</li>

<li> dry cheeks and oily t-zone</li>
<li> This is a Little Pricey, considering can get same thing in Drug Store.</li>
<li> This make-up is my very favourite and think it is a well kept secret which people should try.  </li>

<li> It lasts ALL day and it doesn&#x27;t get that weird look that liquid foundation does after a few hours.  </li>
<li> Seal was broken.  </li>
<li> but this is the wrong color from what I order</li>

<li> I was worried about This product because it was so expensive</li>
<li> Too expensive</li>
<li> The color is wrong for my skin tone</li>
<li> Disturbing.  </li>
<li> I will say it is quite expensive, but it lasted me about 6 months!  </li>
<li> Boy was I wrong!  </li>
<li> Applicator sponge was very dirty.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> just wore it for the first time today, and it&#x27;s just as great as I&#x27;d hoped. I ordered the perfect color on the first try. I was using BE in medium, and bought this in beige. I have light skin, but the lighter powders always make me look like a ghost. This blended well, and didn&#x27;t look cakey or orange. I love that I don&#x27;t have to apply it with a brush. The bottle does open, though (as I found accidentally) and can be applied with the brush if desired. I loved the bare minerals, but wanted to try something less messy. Great stuff, just like the other Philosophy products I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
    <li> Supernatural is just that - super and natural.  Needs no applicator - just dust over face for soft, natural, lasting coverage.  Disguises flaws and lines on face without looking harsh.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I have used the supernatural airbrush for over 3 years now..i LOVE the applicator, and unlike some of the other mineral products i&#x27;ve used, this one doesnt give my skin a strange smell after i&#x27;ve worn it all day long. the applicator makes it incredible, as i can put on a face in less than 10 minutes!  from foundation to eye make up!</li>
    <li> Love it, Love it, Love it.  So easy to use.  It is so very light that you don&#x27;t know you are wearing make-up.</li>
    <li> This stuff is GREAT!  I received it originally as a birthday gift from my Grandmother and was skeptical.  I like full coverage as I have freckles and rosacea, so I did not believe a powder would cover my imperfections.  Boy was I wrong!  The powder is super easy to apply and it goes on like a veil.  It doesn&#x27;t look fake at all.  It lasts ALL day and it doesn&#x27;t get that weird look that liquid foundation does after a few hours.  It is not drying either.  I will say it is quite expensive, but it lasted me about 6 months!  So I really only have to buy this 2x a year so it really is cheaper than most.  I absoultely LOVE Philosophy Supernatural Airbrush Canvas and would recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> This is an Excellent product, although a Little \\&quot;drying\\&quot;.  I Have Dry Skin, and it Drys It even More. But If You Moisturize well Before- Should Be Okay.   I Like the Color, and it Doesnt look all \\&quot;Made UP\\&quot;.  &lt;br /&gt;A Lot of Companies coming out with this Airbrush Minerals, Including Nuetragena, and Loreal , all available cheaper at CVS or drug Stores.  This is a Little Pricey, considering can get same thing in Drug Store.</li>
    <li> This product makes my skin look amazingly flawless and does not feel like it clogs up my pores. I would recommend this foundation to anyone.</li>
    <li> Seal was broken.  Powder was inside and out and more than half of the bottle was empty (Beige color).  Applicator sponge was very dirty.  Disturbing.  Amazon was willing to fix.  Seeing the other reviews it makes me wonder if the same one has been going around.  Ew.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to receive this makeup as I read so many excellent reviews.  However, I am a bit diappinted, as I usually am with powdered makeup.  I don&#x27;t feel I get enough coverage, and I also feel the color is a bit off.  It is quick an easy to apply, though.  I also wish I could find refill sponges for the applicator.</li>
    <li> I really like the Bronze color better since i am usually tan, but this product is just so easy to use. Once the sponge runs out replacements are available. The coverage is unbelievable and makes my skin look great.</li>
    <li> I recently ordered this product, and I am loving it!  It&#x27;s easy to apply and is so light-weight, it feels like I&#x27;m not wearing any makeup. Unlike what was written in another review, this make-up is not glittery.  Also, I have acne-prone skin, but this product doesn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
    <li> Too expensive and it doesn&#x27;t feel the same as the one I am replacing. The color is wrong for my skin tone but it&#x27;s all they had in stock.  The shipping cost made it even more expensive but sephora doesn&#x27;t carry it any more.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it covers very well and also protects never oily! love it! I have rosacea and it covers up the redness well without irritating, goes on easily too!</li>
    <li> Mess free, blends well, always receive compliments about my flawless looking skin. Shipping was very quick also. Never have problems with the powder coming through the sponge.</li>
    <li> When I go back and look at my order it says that I have order beige not medium beige.  I absolutely love this product but this is the wrong color from what I order</li>
    <li> I really like this product. However, I switched foundations.  I use this on weekends.  The price was good. The ship time was also timely.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;thank you.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING!  I have been using it for a few years now and will never go back to the other mineral makeup out there.  Smooth finish, although I still use a brush to &amp;#34;work it in&amp;#34;, the sponge applicator is sufficient.  This stuff is not messy and is a great concealer without looking &amp;#34;made up&amp;#34;.  Doesn&#x27;t create wrinkles, for those of us getting up in years (I&#x27;m over 37) the beige works well for olive tones.  I also bought the next shade up, bronze and honestly, cannot tell much difference.</li>
    <li> Love love love this!! Can&#x27;t ever find it at a store.</li>
    <li> I love Philosophy.  I use the Miracle Worker line and The Present.  I decided to give this a try.  I received it in the afternoon and immediately wanted to try it.  When I put it on around my nose, every pore filled with the makeup and it was very obvious.  It did not blend well at all around my nose.&lt;br /&gt;So I tried it this morning, fresh moisturizer, primer..same result.  If I wasn&#x27;t running so late, I would have washed my face and applied my regular foundations.  I am returning this.&lt;br /&gt;I have other powder foundations, Bare Escentials, and that works fine, so I am not sure why this one did not.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this mineral foundation for several years, and I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.  I have so many people compliment me on my complexion...it&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
    <li> PHILOSOPHY AIRBRUSHED CANVAS. This make-up is my very favourite and think it is a well kept secret which people should try.  I am sure you would not go back to your old product. Easy to use with sponge attached, this gives a great coverage and lasts all day. If there was a ten star rating, I would give it to Philosphy Airbrush Canvas.  As this make-up is very hard to get in Britain, I was very pleased to find it on Amazon and the speed of delivery coming from America was wonderful. As usual, I could not fault Amazon. First class.</li>
    <li> I was worried about This product because it was so expensive I was really really like him because I didn&#x27;t know if I would be happy with it. I am very happy with it it keeps college promises</li>
    <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s a must to use a stiff brush though. The dabbler on the product just doesn&#x27;t blend. i use the bare essentials brushes to apply. It does take a few tries to get a feel for the proper way to apply. Start using only a small amount and build from there.  It covers really nicely. I love this when I&#x27;m on vacation bc it doesn&#x27;t rub off and smudge in the water and also really helps provide sun protection. My husband even dabs a bit on his nose on vacation to prevent a red burned nose. The color is also nice as it blends well with nearly any skin color. It never looks pasty even when I have a tan. Highly recommend. Each tiny container also seems to last for quite a long time. Worth your money for sure.</li>
    <li> straight up do not buy. manufacturer took forever to deliver and product is not as descriped, but yes it is philosophy AND it is HALF full... instead go with dior forever from sephora, staight up awesome makeup and the same price. but if ur on a budget then get revlon colorstay crem to powder, works the best i have seen (other than dior) for combination skin. dry cheeks and oily t-zone</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this - especially the applicator which they no longer make :o(</li>
