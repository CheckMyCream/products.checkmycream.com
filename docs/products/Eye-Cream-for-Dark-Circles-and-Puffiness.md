      <li>After the 5th day I really began to notice the dark circles were significantly reduced and my whole under eye area and cheek appeared much more firmer and lifted!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this cream for almost a week now, but noticed after I applied it under my eyes the first day,</li>

      <li>Thanks for allowing me to review this.</li>
      <li>I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review, and I have used it everyday since I&#x27;ve gotten it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The texture is nice, goes on smoothly and is not greasy or thin.</li>

      <li>Its less puffier and more awake</li>

      <li>The dark circles didn&#x27;t have too much of a change right away, but I did notice they were lessened a little on the first application.</li>
      <li>No more dark circles:)</li>
      <li>I noticed immediately after the first use that the area around my eyes especially underneath my eyes looked less puffy.  </li>
      <li>Recently over the last year, I&#x27;ve been so stressed and have gotten what i think are gigantic puffy dark circles under my eyes and feel like my skin on my cheeks right underneath is starting to look droopy.</li>
      <li>Eye Cream for Dark Circles - I have been plagued with under eye circles my whole life and tried one product after another.</li>
      <li>In the morning I would let it dry completely before applying makeup.</li>
      <li>I have two little ones who don&#x27;t allow for much sleep</li>
      <li>but I do have some minor issues with puffiness especially since I usually don&#x27;t get much sleep since I have a 6 month old who still does not sleep throughout the night.  </li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this this eye cream for a little over a week now.  I don&#x27;t have issues with dark circles but I do have some minor issues with puffiness especially since I usually don&#x27;t get much sleep since I have a 6 month old who still does not sleep throughout the night.  I noticed immediately after the first use that the area around my eyes especially underneath my eyes looked less puffy.  There was a nice cool sensation which I felt help reduce the puffiness.  This actually made my eyes feel awake and refreshed.  The cream itself has a lovely texture, almost silk-like.  No strong odors and was not oily at all.  I used it with in combination with my other skin regiment.  This is a really great eye cream, I would highly recommend to those looking for an eye cream.</li>
    <li> I have seen improvements in the dark circles and puffy skin under my eyes within two days.  Improvement in the dark circles worked best when using the product twice daily.  I noticed dramatic improvement in puffy eyes within two treatments.  Perfect under makeup and the cream dries smooth, not oily or greasy.</li>
    <li> love love love! Check out this product. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> The bags under my eyes are noticeably down. I am highly satisfied with this product. Say goodbye to dark circles! I don&#x27;t get much sleep with being a single parent and full time student so you could imagine the circles I had under my eyes were bad. I&#x27;m in love with this cream. The texture is nice, goes on smoothly and is not greasy or thin. It is of great quality and I do recommend this product if you are looking to banish your circles and bags under your eyes.</li>
    <li> I have dark circles and nothing seems to make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;We purchased this Foxbrim eye cream in a promotion for&lt;br /&gt;testing and review.  I have been using the eye cream for&lt;br /&gt;about a week now.  I love that the ingredients are all&lt;br /&gt;natural and organic, like Green Tea, Vitamin C, Licorice,&lt;br /&gt;Grapeseed Oil, and Rosehip Seed Oil .  The cream is non&lt;br /&gt;greasy and absorbs well.  I will report back with further&lt;br /&gt;results.</li>
    <li> Today I had pretty bad case of puffy eyes from over sleeping lol&lt;br /&gt;But after I massaged these on I can see the difference.Its less puffier and more awake looking xD I loved this &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I love these supplements. I use these every morning and they work great. They came well packaged and sealed. I need to buy some more. Great purchase.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice and smooth product to apply without it feeling thick and cakey. It seems to have faded my dark sets slightly too.</li>
    <li> This is a nice eye cream. It smells good and isn&#x27;t too greasy. I definitely noticed a difference - it reduced the puffiness and darkness after a sleepless night!</li>
    <li> I like this product, but there was a bit of irritation under my eyes from it. Thanks for allowing me to review this.</li>
    <li> Girlfriend tried this and she says it worked for puffy eyes in the morning. She loves it!</li>
    <li> Nice thick cream that stays put on my under eye area and completely not greasy which I&#x27;m happy about. I&#x27;m the type I like to experiment to make sure things work so I put it on my puffierleft eye area and not on my right eye. I noticed that they now matched so it definitely removed puffiness. I don&#x27;t have dark circles so I can&#x27;t comment on that and it&#x27;s hard to say about wrinkles yet cuz I think that takes a while but I don&#x27;t really have have too many but I&#x27;m thrilled because I bought it just for the puffiness factor and its already working!</li>
    <li> Thank you! No more dark circles:)</li>
    <li> You can feel this working as soon as you apply it! It feels amazing - a refreshing cool tingling - its the perfect product to apply in the morning to help wake up and de-puff those tired eyes! I have two little ones who don&#x27;t allow for much sleep so I often wake up with super tired and puffy eyes which take a good hour to start looking normal but this has made such a difference - even my co-workers have noticed! Now that is something to brag about!! I received this in return for my honest review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about a week now and have noticeable reduction in the bags under my eyes.  I&#x27;m impressed!!!</li>
    <li> Great cream. Very smooth. Will take some time to see results but I like the ingredients as usual as I have tried many of Foxbrim&#x27;s products</li>
    <li> Love how it diffidently help my puffiness put it on in the morning and let it dry no more puffiness and the dark circles are getting lighter..will buy again..</li>
    <li> Nice eye cream...a little goes a long way so this bottle should last quite awhile. I really didn&#x27;t detect much fragrance which is nice...doesn&#x27;t compete with other products. I&#x27;ve used it at night for about a week now and maybe it&#x27;s wishful thinking but I swear the dark shadows are a bit lighter and the crow&#x27;s feet are a tad less noticeable. I have actually just started using it on the turkey neck that appears to be taking over my neck...horror of all horrors! Fingers crossed this cream will help that little &amp;#34;situation&amp;#34; like it has helped my eye area!</li>
    <li> Love , love, love this eye cream! It has to be the most moisturizing eye cream I have ever tried! I have oily skin but dry under eyes. This is a fantastic company and highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This cream is great for puffy eyes and dark circles. I used it in the morning and at night. In the morning I would let it dry completely before applying makeup. Makeup went on as if I had no products on and I saw a noticeable difference in less than a week.</li>
    <li> I love this eye cream!  I goes on smoothly and, in just a few days of use, has noticeably reduced the tiny fine lines around my eyes.  It has no fragrance, which is a plus for me.  The pump bottle is great- I don&#x27;t feel like I am wasting any by having to scoop cream out of a jar.  The price point is great for the quality of the product.  I was loyal to another brand, which is half the size and triple the cost of this cream; I am switching to this product since it outperforms the expensive brand!!  I am 36 years old and try to be proactive about the aging of my skin and am happy to be adding this to my regimen.  I received this product at a discount for my unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Great product, very gentle. I love how my skin feels after applying. Love it</li>
    <li> Eye Cream for Dark Circles - I have been plagued with under eye circles my whole life and tried one product after another. This one actually did seem to make my under eye area less puffy and lighter - a few people commented on it even. I tried this on a promo for reviews and so glad I had an opportunity to discover it - I will be replacing the product when I run out. Very Nice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 35 year old female and have taken care of my self extremely well, making sure I eat clean food, exercise daily, take any anti aging supplement and use the best anti aging creams since I was 12. Recently over the last year, I&#x27;ve been so stressed and have gotten what i think are gigantic puffy dark circles under my eyes and feel like my skin on my cheeks right underneath is starting to look droopy. I came across this product offer at a promotional price in exchange for my honest review and thought I would try it out!&lt;br /&gt;After the first application, I thought, &amp;#34;This is an amazing eye cream! &amp;#34; This is only one of the very few that I&#x27;ve found that I noticed almost instant results from. I&#x27;ve been using this cream for almost a week now, but noticed after I applied it under my eyes the first day, about a half hour later I looked back in the mirror and my puffiness was almost completely gone! That made my day! The dark circles didn&#x27;t have too much of a change right away, but I did notice they were lessened a little on the first application. After the 5th day I really began to notice the dark circles were significantly reduced and my whole under eye area and cheek appeared much more firmer and lifted!

    <li> This is a good product if you have an eyebag like me.It makes your eyes look brighter and looks livelier. I will totally recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have a hard time with dark circles under my eyes. I have tried all types of creams and nothing was working. I received this cream to review and I love it. I can see a difference under my eyes and the dark circles are lighter after using this for a week.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know where they came from, but suddenly they were there....dark, aged circles under my eyes...puffiness too. This has helped alot...I keep it in the refrigerator and use almost daily...makes a big difference!</li>
    <li> Once again Foxbrim impresses me! I have many of their skincare products, and I honestly love them all. I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review, and I have used it everyday since I&#x27;ve gotten it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A nice eye cream is key to your skincare routine. It is especially important to use an eye cream to prevent fine lines, and wrinkles as they seem to appear sooner on the face than most other wrinkles. It&#x27;s just so good to keep your eye area healthy, and moisturized!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Vitamin C, E, Green tea, and many more fantastic ingredients - this eye cream can&#x27;t be beat in my book.</li>
