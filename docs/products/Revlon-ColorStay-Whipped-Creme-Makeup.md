      <li>This product is amazing.</li>
      <li>and it has amazing coverage.</li>
      <li>However, it stays amazingly well on my skin, even in this summer heat.</li>
      <li>It goes on so smoothly and gives great coverage.</li>
      <li>I can honestly say, I will not turn to another powder for my face after this.</li>
      <li>It does fill/hide fine lines and does a remarkable job camouflaging deeper lines (not that I am admitting I have any).</li>
      <li>It does not break me out and covers up any redness very easy.</li>
      <li>Also very smooth and creamy.</li>
      <li>I apply it with a stippling brush and it is build able without looking cakey.  </li>

      <li>love the texture</li>
      <li>I love this foundation</li>
      <li>Most of the time I dont even have to use concealer with it.</li>
      <li>I love this foundation.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>The two biggest benefits of using the brush I have found is a) a more flawless overall look, and b)</li>
      <li>I love the finish and feel of this foundation.  </li>
      <li>I have used to many foundations and powder on my face.</li>
      <li>I was working in my beauty department and looking over all that we carried, I have tried majority of our products, but as soon as I tried the revlon colorstay pressed powder, I fell completely in love with it.</li>
      <li>and I was so happy I didn&#x27;t have to spend a fortune to get great coverage that really does last all day!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
      <li>This may sound like an ad for the brush</li>
      <li>I had previously been using Revlon Colorstay Combination/Oily Skin Makeup, [[ASIN:B000YDMGDC Revlon ColorStay Makeup, with SoftFlex, Combination/Oily Skin, Natural Tan 330, 1 oz.]] and had been happy with it for many years.</li>
      <li>If I don&#x27;t have time to re-do before going out after work, I just apply a light pressed powder on my T-zone and I am ready to go.</li>
      <li>I too often go to the bathroom over lunch and find that my makeup is no longer fresh.  </li>
      <li>and I rarely have to use concealer.  </li>
      <li>After applied, my skin looks quite fresh and dewy.</li>
      <li>I matched the right color and makeup is creamy.  </li>
      <li>is natural (match the color more to your neck, not so much to your face, so you won&#x27;t have any makeup</li>
      <li>is natural (match the color more to your neck, not so much to your face, so you won&#x27;t have any makeup</li>
      <li>I saw a commercial for the color stay whipped creme makeup, and bought it in Natural Beige… the color is perfect for my skin tone and you use so little</li>
      <li>I let it dry for 5 minutes and applied my powder and blush and turns out I love this.  </li>
      <li>I still have more than half a jar left, and would have more</li>
      <li>I apply with a Real Techniques foundation brush....</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s really for both products combined.  </li>
      <li>So, I was about ready to buy some higher-end foundation elsewhere when I decided to give this a try, (and, it was on sale).</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t even have to use that much, just a dab here and a dab there</li>
      <li>I highly recommend!</li>
      <li>very luxurious on the skin;&lt;br /&gt;*great coverage;</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m from Germany,so it took a long time to get the product,but it was worth it!</li>

      <li>I have shopped high and low from brands like revlon, maybelline, and cover girl, to high end department store foundations looking for one that really lasts.  </li>
      <li>Make sure your face is dry before applying, but moisturize well because it loves pointing out where your skin is dry.</li>
      <li>, I apply the Revlon Colorstay Pressed Powder [[ASIN:B000YDJGVC Revlon ColorStay Pressed Powder with SoftFlex, Fair 810, 0.3 Ounce]] after about a minute of applying this foundation, (when it is thoroughly dry) and the two together really work well for my normally fussy skin to keep it fresh-looking all day.&lt;br /&gt;Also, there is hardly any scent to this, it is extremely faint and mild, in case you are sensitive to strong smells as I am.</li>
      <li>I am happy to say that it not only seems to make my skin look way better than it actually is (skin discolorations, uneven skin tone and the beginnings of wrinkles), but it hasn&#x27;t broken me out in the 3 weeks I have been using it.</li>
      <li>I have ridiculously sensitive skin and have zero problems with this product.  </li>
      <li>The texture is creamy and soft and feels lightweight on my skin.</li>
      <li>This product leaves skin soft and well-covered.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 21 years old, and have scars from acne and discolorations.</li>
      <li>My oldest teen actually complimented me, telling me that my face looked pretty and fresh.&lt;br</li>
      <li>but the first few times of using it I got out too much.</li>
      <li>The next day, I open the jar and see this very creamy foundation, and I&#x27;m wondering if this is going to slide right off my face, as it looks too creamy/moisturizing for my skin type (sensitive, adult, naturally oily and prone to breakouts if I&#x27;m not consistent with my skin care regimine).</li>
      <li>worth all the money spent!!</li>
      <li>no more makeup caked in my smile lines!  </li>
      <li>I use a small plastic utensil to get this out with, which I clean after every use to help prevent bacteria from entering into the jar/not using my fingers to get it out).</li>
      <li>The cost wasn&#x27;t that much, seeing how long it will last.  </li>

    <li> I love this foundation. It does not break me out and covers up any redness very easy. Most of the time I dont even have to use concealer with it. I apply it with a stippling brush and it is build able without looking cakey.  Unfortunately its a little on the expensive side for a drugstore foundation but its well worth it.</li>

    <li> This foundation is very nice to use, easy to apply, invisible on the skin, skin breathe! This tone is very natural on my skin and is very resistant!</li>
    <li> I matched the right color and makeup is creamy.  I use this under mineral powder. it works well for me.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and is the perfect color.  Also very smooth and creamy.</li>
    <li> I have shopped high and low from brands like revlon, maybelline, and cover girl, to high end department store foundations looking for one that really lasts.  I too often go to the bathroom over lunch and find that my makeup is no longer fresh.  This is the answer and I was so happy I didn&#x27;t have to spend a fortune to get great coverage that really does last all day!  I am in my 40&#x27;s and was concerned about foundation that settles in my wrinkles but this seems to &amp;#34;float&amp;#34; over them and diminish their appearance! I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have ridiculously sensitive skin and have zero problems with this product.  Also a little goes a long, long way.  I love the finish and feel of this foundation.  Doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing anything at all!  Coverage is great and I rarely have to use concealer.  I apply with a Real Techniques foundation brush....in fact I think another review I read on this product talked about the brush which is how I discovered it.  I had never used (nor heard of) using a brush to apply foundation but find it works perfectly with this product!!!  Real Techniques also has a website that shows you how to use the brush to apply foundation.  This may sound like an ad for the brush but it&#x27;s really for both products combined.  The two biggest benefits of using the brush I have found is a) a more flawless overall look, and b) no more makeup caked in my smile lines!  I&#x27;m 46-years-old and am starting to learn how to do my makeup all over again - you kinda have to once your skin turns that 40-something corner.</li>
    <li> I have used to many foundations and powder on my face. I&#x27;m 21 years old, and have scars from acne and discolorations. I was working in my beauty department and looking over all that we carried, I have tried majority of our products, but as soon as I tried the revlon colorstay pressed powder, I fell completely in love with it. I can honestly say, I will not turn to another powder for my face after this. I get so many compliments and people keep staring at my face because it looks so flawless. My next stop? colorstay whipped.</li>
    <li> goes on beautifully and smoothly....love the texture</li>
    <li> I usually use a pressed powder, but decided it wasn&#x27;t working for me anymore.  I saw a commercial for the color stay whipped creme makeup, and bought it in Natural Beige… the color is perfect for my skin tone and you use so little and it covers so well.  You do not have that overdone makeup look.  The cost wasn&#x27;t that much, seeing how long it will last.  I am very happy I decided to try it out!</li>
    <li> At first I did not really like this product I felt it went on thick and looked unnatural.  However I tried it again and this time I used a cotton make up applicator and removed excess after I applied then I let it dry for 5 minutes and applied my powder and blush and turns out I love this.  It lasts all day and it does look extremely creamy and natural without being too thick or unnatural looking. Will repurchase.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I didn&#x27;t even have to use that much, just a dab here and a dab there and it has amazing coverage. Staying power is good too. Lasts such a long time. I love it. It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
    <li> stays on for the day and has great coverage...&lt;br /&gt;will definatly buy again.&lt;br /&gt;one bad thing is the packaging i hate dipping my fingers into the jar would prefer a tube maybe, but otherwise can&#x27;t fault.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m from Germany,so it took a long time to get the product,but it was worth it! I love this foundation and I would order it again!:)</li>
    <li> This product leaves skin soft and well-covered. It doesn&#x27;t last long; after applying it in the morning, I need to reapply it in the afternoon so my face won&#x27;t be naked for the evening. Make sure your face is dry before applying, but moisturize well because it loves pointing out where your skin is dry. Blend well if the color is a little darker than your face.</li>
    <li> too heavy and caky one me</li>
    <li> I had previously been using Revlon Colorstay Combination/Oily Skin Makeup, [[ASIN:B000YDMGDC Revlon ColorStay Makeup, with SoftFlex, Combination/Oily Skin, Natural Tan 330, 1 oz.]] and had been happy with it for many years. However, recently, it seems to be lacking in some of the coverage I was used to, or it could just be that my skin&#x27;s aging process isn&#x27;t compatible with it any longer. So, I was about ready to buy some higher-end foundation elsewhere when I decided to give this a try, (and, it was on sale). The next day, I open the jar and see this very creamy foundation, and I&#x27;m wondering if this is going to slide right off my face, as it looks too creamy/moisturizing for my skin type (sensitive, adult, naturally oily and prone to breakouts if I&#x27;m not consistent with my skin care regimine). Curious, I tried it anyway. I am happy to say that it not only seems to make my skin look way better than it actually is (skin discolorations, uneven skin tone and the beginnings of wrinkles), but it hasn&#x27;t broken me out in the 3 weeks I have been using it. A little goes a long way, I use about a fat pea size to cover my face and still have just a bit left over to touch up any area that I missed or that needs extra attention. I still have more than half a jar left, and would have more but the first few times of using it I got out too much. I use a small plastic utensil to get this out with, which I clean after every use to help prevent bacteria from entering into the jar/not using my fingers to get it out). When I first applied it, I thought that it was going to seriously be too oily for my skin, because the consistency was much less liquidy that what I was accustomed to, rather a creamy (luxurious-feeling) consistency. However, it stays amazingly well on my skin, even in this summer heat. My oldest teen actually complimented me, telling me that my face looked pretty and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;FYI, I apply the Revlon Colorstay Pressed Powder [[ASIN:B000YDJGVC Revlon ColorStay Pressed Powder with SoftFlex, Fair 810, 0.3 Ounce]] after about a minute of applying this foundation, (when it is thoroughly dry) and the two together really work well for my normally fussy skin to keep it fresh-looking all day.&lt;br /&gt;Also, there is hardly any scent to this, it is extremely faint and mild, in case you are sensitive to strong smells as I am. There is no odor when it is on your face, which is an added plus for me.&lt;br /&gt;RECAP:&lt;br /&gt;*seems to \\&quot;float\\&quot; over tiny wrinkles, leaving skin looking close to flawless;&lt;br /&gt;*stays on well, even on oily skin;&lt;br /&gt;*hasn&#x27;t irritated or broken out my skin, which is very \\&quot;fussy\\&quot;;&lt;br /&gt;*color is natural (match the color more to your neck, not so much to your face, so you won&#x27;t have any makeup line);&lt;br /&gt;*lasts a long time, only takes a little bit;&lt;br /&gt;*very, very faint, light scent;&lt;br /&gt;*feels very luxurious on the skin;&lt;br /&gt;*great coverage;der with SoftFlex, Fair 810, 0.3 Ounce]] after about a minute of applying this foundation, (when it is thoroughly dry) and the two together really work well for my normally fussy skin to keep it fresh-looking all day.&lt;br /&gt;Also, there is hardly any scent to this, it is extremely faint and mild, in case you are sensitive to strong smells as I am.

    <li> I tried this product and used it for about 2 weeks. I gave up on it because it was making my face break out. I am 48 but still have somewhat oily  skin and get clogged pores if I use products containing dimethicone. I thought I could get away with it because my skin is somewhat drier than it used to be, but it seems not so. After 2 weeks I have a lot of clogged pores that were not there before. I have given up on this product and will either return it or throw it out if I can&#x27;t take it back. I just can&#x27;t use it. This morning I realized I had three actual cysts on my face from using this product. I reviewed the ingredient list and it&#x27;s full of dimethicone and other silicone-like ingredients that make the foundation very smooth, but are too heavy for skin like mine. I&#x27;m going back to Bare Minerals mineral powder foundation, a much better alternative for skin like mine.</li>
    <li> I like this makeup a lot. I have reordered two or three times now. It goes on so smoothly and gives great coverage. It does fill/hide fine lines and does a remarkable job camouflaging deeper lines (not that I am admitting I have any). After applied, my skin looks quite fresh and dewy. This makeup tends to hold all day. If I don&#x27;t have time to re-do before going out after work, I just apply a light pressed powder on my T-zone and I am ready to go. Even though I tend toward oily skin, this makeup doesn&#x27;t slide off by the end of the day. It washes off easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to keep in mind: I do wear glasses daily and this makeup (like all others I have tried) does gunk up a little under my glasses frames. I just take a tissue and wipe the area where my glasses will sit on my nose before I put them on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this product again &amp; again.</li>
    <li> its an excellent product for a flawless even look!! i usually apply it over a moisturizer, it stays for long without smudging.. i don&#x27;t find it necessary to use anything else. worth all the money spent!!</li>
