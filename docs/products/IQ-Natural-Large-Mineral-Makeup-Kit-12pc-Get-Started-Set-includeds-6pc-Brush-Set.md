<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> love great price and will last quite a while</li>
    <li> Great mineral makeup. Natural look!</li>
    <li> GREAT MAKE UP FOR SKIN THAT CLEAR BUT NOT GOOD FOR PEOPLE WITH ACNE</li>
    <li> I have used Bare Minerals, Tart, and other very expensive products.  I was very impressed with IQ products.  I thought I would get sample sizes for the price I paid and was very excited that I got full size and brushes! The quality is excellent and I love the eye shadow and the cover up powder. You can&#x27;t go wrong for this price and excellent quality.</li>
    <li> nice kit for the money</li>
    <li> I really like this product. So much that I also bought the Starter Kit. The finish is great. It is hard to believe this price! Why does the other brands charge so much for the same thing? I mostly use the bisque as concealer, the foundation and very little of bronzer. The eye shadows are OK, a little bit too sparkly for me. I do not like eye shadows anyways. I aim for a natural and fresh make up that looks like no make up. The brushes are good, soft and nice. the bag not that good. The snap is a little rusty and can hold only the brushes not the make up. I will keep the 5 starts because the bag is not important for me. I will keep all in my own bag.</li>
    <li> crap, not at all like bare minerals and upset that I wasted the money.</li>
    <li> I thought it was bare minerals that it was getting its okay but i definitely won&#x27;t be buying it again but great deal im just not a big On makeup but it does look good and makes my skin look flawless also the eyeshadow it comes with is great i woulve giving it 5 stars but the finshing powder wasnt as great as i hoped but still a great product i recommend it</li>
    <li> Gives instructions on what order to put makeup on but not all that you&#x27;re supposed to put on isn&#x27;t in there.</li>
    <li> Burns my skin and doesn&#x27;t ork</li>
    <li> This is a decent product. I bought this for my girlfriend and she stated that this product does not give the smooth even appearance quite as well as purity or bare minerals but since she doesn&#x27;t want to pay the premium price for bare minerals and since we can no longer find purity, she said this is a decent medium and definitely better than those walmart and CVS brands price wise but she will continue looking for one comparable in price and quality as the purity we recently bought from amazon and can no longer seem to find.</li>
    <li> I will definitely order this again!</li>
    <li> A little sparkly. Not great for a 55 year old.</li>
    <li> I love it especially when it looks completely natural. That&#x27;s the way I like it!!!</li>
    <li> im use to bare minerals but the price  difference is a good buy if your looking for something cheaper</li>
    <li> Was unable to use product as the shipping for this product is terrible.  However, the company did give me back my money since I was unable to use the product.  However, I would be very aware...the brushes are terrible quality and considering the packaging and the care of product.  I am sure the product is a cheap as the brushes.  Just be careful with purchasing this item.  You are getting what you are paying so little for.</li>
    <li> Have been a I.Q. convert after looking for loreal minerals makeup and stumbling across this sample kit.  Although the product is smaller than used to a little goes a looong way!  As an older woman my skin tends to be on the dry side I appreciate that the foundation and setting veil don&#x27;t dry out my skin but hydrates it.  I am a I.Q. fan and will reorder when running low.</li>
    <li> The product if very cheap, the containers the makeup is in are terrible you cannot use them without spilling the makeup all over the place.</li>
    <li> This is the best mineral makeup ever! I&#x27;ve used bare min, pur min, Lancôme, E Lauder, Mary K and a few more. I work outside and I sweat! This makeup stays put better than ANY other. Great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> I got medium but was nervous tyhat it was going to be to dark for my skin as my skin tone is a light/medium but this was actually to light for my skin, bu I was able to use it on others when doing their make up and it was a great product, I would just recommend getting one shade darker than what you normally use.</li>
    <li> love this im getting more! blends great with my skin. my boyfriend has never said anything about my makeup the last 3 years, i got this and he asked what i was doing cause my skin looked great.fyi i have alot of pimples and scars and he said he cant even see them</li>
    <li> This is now my choice of powder makeup I use to buy the high priced makeup because I had tried some of the off brands in the past with no luck at all so when I saw this brand I thought I would try but did not have my hopes very high.  Well guess I was wrong because the coverage of this makeup was as good if not better than the other name brand I have always used now I have a new brand in my bag and will never look back.</li>
    <li> I have always been interested in trying mineral make up. I have tried a popular brand before and I ended up having an allergic reaction to it. Because of my curiosity of wanting to try it, I decided to give this brand a try. To my surprise I didn&#x27;t have any allergic reactions. This make up is awesome! And it only takes a little to get the look I desire. It really gives you a natural look, which is the only look I love to have when applying make up. The color of the shadows are perfect for my skin complexion. This make up doesn&#x27;t have any weird smells. The brushes that come in the kit are soft and work great! I received this product for my honest opinion and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Shade is a little light . But I&#x27;ve blended colors to make it work</li>
    <li> As always!  On Point!!</li>
    <li> Great, just as good as Sheer. Great coverage. Gave me the results I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Love this make-up! It covers well and stays in place, and the shimmer eye shadows are beautiful! I definitely recommend trying it for yourself!</li>
    <li> Great coverage. After I use it I look photoshopped! I Will be recommending this make up. Thank you for the great products at an amazing price</li>
    <li> I like so many others who purchased this product, am a bare minerals fan. The light feel, the flawless coverage, and the subtle glow! I just love Bare minerals. I decided to try this product after reading so many of the bare mineral offerings were apparently fakes. The price was right and it seemed like a lot for the money. Well for my $19.99 I got a messy bathroom, some crappy brushes that leave little plastic fibers all over your face, and a heaping dose of disappointment.  If you are wanting to dress up as a cold pale pasty faced corpse this might work for you. It&#x27;s like very heavy talc and feels heavy and uncomfortable on your face. If it is coverage you&#x27;re after, you&#x27;re in luck because the coverage provided  looks like a Michael Myers mask. There is no glow. No amount of tap and buff will get this stuff to blend. So unless you are looking for Halloween makeup, or attending a clown convention spring for the extra money and get bare minerals.</li>
    <li> Gentle on sensitive skin. Decent coverage, and when I asked my husband how it looked he said it looked nice, not caked on like my other make-up.  Being a powder, this make-up does get a touch messy when applying. Dont wear black while applying!  Easily matched my skin tone without looking like a mask. Tends to settle into wrinkles on forehead and around nose (a light rub with fingers evens it out) after about an hou.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Stays on all day. The color didn&#x27;t fit my complexion but I contacted the company and they sent me the right color.</li>
    <li> Brushes were very stiff so didn&#x27;t end up having any use for them... Powders did the job for the time I needed them, probably personally wouldn&#x27;t use for everyday use, but I&#x27;m not a mineral makeup kinda gal. Needed it to use on multiple people for a photoshoot, and they did their job for that though!</li>
    <li> I got it for my granddaughter. It&#x27;s a great introduction to the world of makeup.  inexpensive and amply equipped to usher in a tasteful introduction to enhancing beauty rather than \\&quot;painting\\&quot; it on!</li>
    <li> I really like it. My skin feels good,looks good.  Brushes a lil stiff.. Spillt some on my leg rubbed in and u could see big difference in side witout powder in -covered Redness and smoothed skin. Ill buy agai from this company, Good price</li>
    <li> I am still learning how to use it, not because it is difficult, but I am a older lady who has always used liquid make-up. It does seem to look better on me, and once I get it down I think I will really like it.</li>
    <li> This item came before i thought it would, and that gives me reason to buy again!! I was very happy with this and i would like more!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a cheaper alternative to Bare Minerals for a very long time now and I must say, this make up exceeded my expectations!  The price is right, the product provides AWESOME coverage, and this is coming from someone who is not only acne prone, but has a very uneven skin tone.  I have definitely made the switch from Bare Minerals to IQ&#x27;s mineral makeup! :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never tried mineral makeup before so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to. I&#x27;m in my mid 20s and my skin is still pretty good but I wanted something to smooth and even out my skin. I was looking at bare minerals when I came across IQ. The reviews were really good as was the price. Plus they&#x27;re full sized not tiny samples. It took a couple tries to get it to look right (as does any new makeup really). Once I got the right brush it was awesome. Just the right amount of coverage for me. Didn&#x27;t look or feel caky which is really nice. Doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or like it&#x27;s suffocating my face. I forgot to take my makeup off one night and the next morning it did look a little cracked on my forehead but that was my fault. I will definitely be buying IQ makeup again!</li>
    <li> I really like the makeup. It matches my skin perfectly! It feels like I&#x27;m not wearing any makeup. Arrived on time and was just like described! Thanks.</li>
    <li> I received my order so quick, it was quite amazing how soon. It was a WONDERFUL package of amazing brushes, all sorts of different makeup and a fantastic bisque miracle powder. In love with it, will definitely order this again!</li>
    <li> It was everything I expected. The colors were as shown and the brushes were great. I am really enjoying the mineral makeup.</li>
    <li> Ordered the Medium Color Kit&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to like this product. I rarely wear a lot of make-up but had a job interview coming up so I thought I would try this product. I have a fair to medium complex and my skin is clear so I do not need a lot of coverage. I thought a nice foundation with a medium base would be good to try. When I first received the make-up I thought they made a mistake. The foundation was very light in color. I tried it and was so disappointed. There was no coverage what-so-ever. It was like putting on a translucent face powder. I tried putting more on but all that did was made my skin a pasty white. My skin tone is on the lighter side so I do not know how they can consider this a medium colored foundation. The quality of the make-up is also extremely cheap. I have bought inexpensive make-up at the store that is much a better quality than this. I think it is a waste of money for a product that does not work, at least for me. I am sending it back.</li>
    <li> Longtime user of all the various mineral products dating back to 2004.  The brushes are cheap but who cares - the product is more natural and lasts longer than Sheer Cover (be very careful of this company NOW big scam very cheap product) - Bare Minerals and Bare Essentials.  I&#x27;ve bought 3 sets now and will continue to do so.  Make sure to turn brush upside down and tap so it evenly distributes on the brush and then on your face.  If you don&#x27;t it (like all mineral powders) will spread clumpy and you will waste allot.  Only complaint was one small contained out of 3 shipments was missing the hole filter and it came flying out.  I didn&#x27;t care because I don&#x27;t use that one anyways.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and very ,very good finish</li>
    <li> I bought this for my niece and this stuff cleared her face up and she loves it.</li>
    <li> Consistancy-&lt;br /&gt;IQ- Thicker powder&lt;br /&gt;BM- Thinner powder&lt;br /&gt;Winner&#x3D; IQ. I get more use for using less.

I feel a lightness to my makeup with both but as far as quality and price there is no competition IQ mineral makeup may be the underdog, but I think word is quickly going to spread about this miracle makeup! I also just got one of their 88 eyeshadow pallettes to pair with this... stya turned for that review!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the brushes, I&#x27;ve used better, but they are great for an over night/ quick in the car travel backup!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to recieve this kit at a promotional price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> The brushes are average.  Not as good as I have gotten in the past from bare minerals.  Price much better.  The product is good and I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I tried this thinking I could save a few bucks off of the usual product I use (bareminerals) and boy was I wrong! It isn&#x27;t near as fine as my usual brand and doesn&#x27;t settle on my skin either, I didn&#x27;t even  care for the eye product. Brushes were pretty nice but that&#x27;s about as much as I can compliment this product on!</li>
    <li> Not good.  Very cakie and not natural looking</li>
    <li> Everything  was perfect and delivery was right on time</li>
    <li> Always looking for something less expensive to take the place of my Bare Minerals, unfortunately, this is not that product. The foundations and other products are rather &amp;#34;bright&amp;#34; in color (not natural looking) and the consistency was very coarse or large flakes that don&#x27;t go onto your face in a natural looking way. It looked like I had used either baby powder or Halloween makeup one I had it applied. It was splotchy and did not blend smoothly into my face as I had hoped. Since I have opened it, I suppose I am stuck with it, and maybe with A LOT of practice I could make it look natural on my face, but I&#x27;m not holding my breath. I did enjoy some of the brushes though, especially the eyelash/eyebrow comb and the flat eye shadow brush. Overall though, I was sincerely disappointed as I was completely out of makeup and basically still am until I can figure out how to make this kind work for me. The price was right, so it&#x27;s a double shame.</li>
    <li> The makeup itself is ok, but the brushes are not good at all.  Very cheap &amp; thin.  Explanation of items was not good either. Still not sure what a couple of them are</li>
    <li> Great product I recommend it to people who don&#x27;t want to look like they are wearing tons of make up.</li>
    <li> Great with covering up pimple spots and red marks, a lil tough to blend, but once you get it blended in it works amazing and doesn&#x27;t rub off on your clothes like other powders.</li>
    <li> Love the natural coverage it gives. The brushes, although in a cheap bag, are of decent quality.  I would purchase this make up again. I love it !</li>
    <li> This makeup is awesome ! I have no complaints</li>
    <li> Ok this mineral makeup is fantastic! Covers super great (btw I have acne, acne scars, redness, blotchy &amp; very pale) easy to use doesn&#x27;t make my very sensitive skin breakout , lasts for a really long time....but there is a key to making this stuff work. The trio reduce, prime,&amp;set...which is a toner, primer, and setting mist all made for mineral makeup. Which just go to the original iq naturals site &amp; order the set and the set is truly amazing my face has cleared up and I barely use makeup now just a little to look flawless and natural. I&#x27;m very pleased with this cosmetic line and all there organic amazing products. Because if you put this mineral makeup on without the trio to tone, prime and set it won&#x27;t be everything you hope for, but with it best make up I&#x27;ve ever put on my acne prone sensitive pale skin! Definitely worth getting as long as you get the other stuff with it also really great high quality organic vegan stuff!</li>
    <li> IQ Natural is for starters. Those that love makeup... possibly move on to different brands but I admit this one is okay. I had to add other foundation products with it to enhance the look of fabulous.  When I purchased this makeup I had date nights and photo shoots in mind. The date nights were ruled out with this product because it just doesn&#x27;t feel so natural if you have to apply other makeup brands you&#x27;ve got in your duffle bag. IQ 12pc Medium didn&#x27;t serve the full purpose I was expecting but it can be worked with. I rated I love it because although I don&#x27;t wear makeup everyday..who doesn&#x27;t love makeup...</li>
    <li> Great product!  I will not use any other product!!!!!</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t purchase again. Not very good coverage.</li>
    <li> Normally I use Bare Minerals, but I was looking for a new brand of mineral makeup that was a little less expensive. When I received my order (12 pc. Lg medium and 12 pc. XL golden tan), I thought my golden tan was the wrong color, because it says dark tan. After being informed of name change, I mixed my two foundations together. This morning I finally got to use my new IQ makeup and so far, I love it. The colors ended up working perfect together. My 2 kits were less than $40 (together), I&#x27;m quite sure I will be using IQ over Bare Minerals. Thank you for pricing a GREAT PRODUCT so reasonably affordable.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not Ulta. I ordered medium but it is too light and the bronzer is very dark, I can&#x27;t use that.  I did like the tools and the eyeshadow as well as the translucent</li>
    <li> The color is not medium so I cannot use 2 of the items, and the mineral veil doesn&#x27;t last.  But I do like the eyeshadows and the warmth colors.  I use all 3 on my eyes.  I also like the brushes.  They arent the best quality, but do fit in with the pricetage of this item.</li>
    <li> I like the case but I guess I assumed that the makeup would fit in the case as well but it doesn&#x27;t</li>
    <li> I had been searching for a good and affordable mineral makeup since the company I used to purchase from disappeared.  I found it!</li>
    <li> Honestly, I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect but I was not expecting it to work this well. I do have blemishes and dark circles under my eyes (courtesy of my late night partying 2 year old daughter) and this made them almost non existent. I did have to use my liquid concealer under it before applying the powder which did help cover up pimples or dark circles but other than that it looks very natural. And its quick to do too! I would totally recommend this to someone!</li>
    <li> Overall great for the price.  One brush broke the day I got it but that is to be expected for the price!</li>
    <li> This was perfect.  Easier to buy online.</li>
    <li> This make up is so natural looking and provides great coverage</li>
    <li> A great makeup kit for the price!  The brushes aren&#x27;t the best quality, but the make-up alone is worth the money.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE it. The cover up powder is amazing much better than the Bare Minerals I use. Love all the brushes and case.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way. Very affordable!</li>
    <li> IQ cosmetics never let me down I always recomend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> I wanted this product to beat Bare Essentials, isn&#x27;t going to happen. I could not wear this makeup in public, if I had daughters I wouldn&#x27;t even let them use it for play. It&#x27;s not good enough to be costume play makeup. I tried using the dark shade for eye shadow but the rest of it no use, colors are light, no coverage, it&#x27;s so bad I can&#x27;t find the words to explain it. It&#x27;s not worth trying it is a complete waste of money. If you say it works for your skin fine, but I would not believe it ..I think it&#x27;s awful in every way.</li>
    <li> Poor quality!! The brushes fall apart. Used mine for the first time and 1/4 of the bristles fell out.. I looked like I was covered in cat hair!!&lt;br /&gt;No instructions came with the set on how to apply...very disappointed in this especially after reading the description... Won&#x27;t buy again or recommend. Sorry,</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to purchase IQ, and actually had bareMinerals by Bare Escentuals in my cart when I landed on the IQ sample page. I have been a Bare Escentuals wearer for a long time. I&#x27;ve also tried some other knock-off mineral powders such as Maybellene. What a joke those turned out to be. Today my IQ makeup came and I will break down the differences between bareMinerals and IQ for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the final look achieved with both are equally stunning. IQ stays put much longer because it is not as fine as bareMinerals. It is only a tad bit heavier; however, it absolutely leaves no creasing, and is not noticeable at all as long as it is applied correctly. The bareMinerals foundation jars have smaller filter holes to strain the powders better. IQ tends to pile on top of the jar due to filter holes that are larger. Since the IQ foundation is already a tad bit heavier, having a mound of it to work with can be challenging. To avoid this problem place a cotton ball in the top of the jar when you are not using it so the powder doesn&#x27;t seep from the bottom to the top. When it&#x27;s applied, tap the jar gently and apply a small portion to the brush at a time. I&#x27;ve found these results to leave a natural, healthy overall look. Nobody will be able to guess if the final result is bareMinerals or IQ!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only dissapointment to me is the mineral veil. bareMinerals kicks the pants off of IQ&#x27;s veil. When the IQ veil is applied it just stays where you set the brush instead of floating down your face like the bareMinerals veil. It does leave a nice finished look however, so it&#x27;s not a complete disappointment. It does a good job at &amp;#34;finishing&amp;#34; the look, but it just isn&#x27;t the same as bareMinerals. I will miss this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve struggled to find a good concealer to hide my dark eye circles. The IQ concealer is one of the best I have ever used. It hides my dark circles, and blends naturally with my face. I wish I could purchase a larger jar of it! I was not as impressed with the bareMinerals concealer since it did not seem to blend naturally with my skin tone, and did not completely cover my dark circles. I strongly prefer the IQ concealer to the bareMinerals concealer. IQ wins this round.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The IQ eyeshadow is stunning. It is mucho perfecto! The neutral color is light and sparkly, yet vibrant. It does not crease, and lasts all day. It reminds me of fairy dust, and is great to use on top of pigmented shadows to leave a sparkling effect. This is my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; shadow for both casual and formal wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read in the comments to order a shade darker as IQ runs light. I&#x27;m sure glad I did! I have a light-med skin tone, and ordered the medium, which is the perfect shade for me. It even came with an extra concealer that is one shade darker, and is the ideal shade for my summer tan! The IQ is hands down the best I&#x27;ve tried of any mineral makeup next to bareMinerals, and ranks a very close 2nd. I will be using this from now on. Goodbye expensive bareMinerals!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;06/19/2016&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m back for yet another purchase of IQ. I&#x27;ve updated my review to reflect some additional pointers and thoughts that I&#x27;ve acquired since my initial purchase over four years ago!

    <li> Brushes are not too flexible. Makeup is not of quality</li>
    <li> So, so disappointed in this purchase!  I am not a huge makeup person, but with freckles and getting **cough** a little older, I thought I&#x27;d give mineral makeup a go.  I read a ton of reviews and decided this was a good entry-level product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions and looked like a whitefaced mime.  I figured it was me - all those years as a tomboy had left me unable to apply makeup.  I watched youtube videos of others who know what they&#x27;re doing, then tried again - and I looked like I should be headlining in the stage production of \\&quot;Powder.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I could get my money back, I would - but I don&#x27;t think I can.  Guess I&#x27;ll pass this along to my nieces for playtime makeup or save this for Halloween.  What a bummer.</li>
    <li> I received these items and was really excited about using them! the make-up is good quality but the brushes are very flimsly, the brush is really long and it doesn&#x27;y apply smoothly.  I would purchase again just for the eye shadow and the powder (which is something i will keep in my purse for touch-ups but wont use originally)</li>
    <li> I was excited to get this product after reading the reviews AND after seeing the price. As a Bare Minerals user I was psyched to think I could get basically the same thing for a fraction of the cost. Well, I opened my package, took out the make-up and looked at it curiously since it wasn&#x27;t in a pretty box like my Bare Minerals. The make-up cups were enclosed in a Zip lock baggy (no, I&#x27;m not kidding.) Oh well, I thought, no big deal, I&#x27;m not the type to care about fancy boxes, especially since it was a great price! I lined up my cups excitedly and opened the brush set. I should have known just by the brushes that this was not going to be anything like Bare Minerals. First of all, the BM brushes have hair like bristles that are soft, fluffy, and pleasant on the skin. IQ&#x27;s brushes have plastic synthetic bristles. Huh? That was surprising. Oh well, I moved on and opened the lid to my new mineral make up, began application and noticed immediately it was like baby powder being puffed in my face making me look ghostly. It didn&#x27;t have a nice texture like BM, instead it was a dusty mess.&lt;br /&gt;Moving along, I tried the blush...well, let me warn you...just because the foundation cups come with a sifter type top under the lid (that pops off so easily I almost lost it all - not that it would matter aside from the clean-up) doesn&#x27;t mean the smaller cups do. Well, now you have little cups of fine dust that gets everywhere. Why? Um, probably because THERE IS NO COVER on them. Yet, I still wanted to be a believer, so I dipped my plastic bristly brush in and applied. The result? I looked like a dusty mime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, if you enjoy plastic bristles as your make-up brushes then you will love the applicators which, as a bonus, are glamorously encased in a flashy, glossy, cheap plastic lipstick red pouch.  If you want to apply make-up that is much like talc or similar to the layer of dust that accumulates on dressers if not cleaned, then this set will be your jackpot. If you are planning on a career as a fairy and need the convenient containers for your pixie dust, then you will no doubt be pleased. As for me, I am going to crawl back to my Bare Minerals and beg it&#x27;s forgiveness.are planning on a career as a fairy and need the convenient containers for your pixie dust, then you will no doubt be pleased.

    <li> Now this product is good but they do not s</li>
    <li> Perfect in every way.</li>
    <li> this product is awful. It doesn&#x27;t stay true to color and gets clumpy. I&#x27;ll neve order again</li>
    <li> Excellent , previously a bare minerals user. This is a wonderful product, especially for the price ! I will definitely  purchase again</li>
    <li> This mineral makeup feels good on my skin and is helping with breakouts. My only problem is that the shades are too light. I ordered medium and it is very fair. Especially the bisque concealer. It is what I&#x27;d consider ivory rather than a medium beige. So order a shade or two darker than what you&#x27;d normally wear and it should work.</li>
    <li> Other than poor packaging and one of my containers were cracked and spilled everywhere,  I was pleasantly surprised! Great coverage for the price.  I highly recommend using a primer though!</li>
    <li> Awesome product!  I love the coverage it gives me-I&#x27;ve tried Bare Minerals and IQ is very similar, but with a better price!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping lovin the makeup</li>
    <li> I purchased this thinking I was purchasing a special deal on the more expensive brand of Bare Minerals.&lt;br /&gt;Although there was a little initial dissapointment, I decided to try it out. I had read the reviews on the brushes and decided to not even open them.&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised that I thought the poor reviews had really exaggerated, I felt that it was pretty good makeup with pretty good coverage. I wasn&#x27;t going to re-order my Bare Minerals right away, I felt that this make up was fine, and there is a good chance I might switch due to the price difference.&lt;br /&gt; My 14 yr. old daughter likes it better than Bare Minerals ( smirk), so that gives it 5 stars in my book, she will now leave my makeup alone!&lt;br /&gt;Turns out, she liked the brushes, they really weren&#x27;t that terrible, what I expect from these cheaper package deals.&lt;br /&gt;When it comes time to re-order, I will re-order this brand, it is a big cost savings and the only difference I see is the packaging.</li>
    <li> I am allergic to everything but not this. :)))) Great coverage, the brushes are awesome. So worth the buy.</li>
    <li> Much lighter then expected.  Said it was a medium beige but looks more like a light beige.  I had to buy a darker mineral makeup and combine them for the right color.</li>
    <li> Love it !!! Just as good as bare minerals!</li>
    <li> I love the eyeshadow the best think the foundation brush should be tighter /not so flimsy ,so better brushes and foundation could cover a lil better  so about a 6/10 rating</li>
    <li> Good product.  Comparable to Bare Minerals, but much less expensive.  Brushes need to be upgraded, so I recommend using your own brushes, or getting some good brushes.  Good brushes makes the process so much easier.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s only ok.  I don&#x27;t hate it but I certainly don&#x27;t love it either.</li>
    <li> Love love love it!!!! I have never used a product with such great coverage as this one. Others leave you looking like cake batter on your face. This product is light and a little goes a long way and some of the best concealer I have ever used!</li>
    <li> I plan to purchase this line of products in the future, that&#x27;s how much I like it.</li>
    <li> This is great.. Love it doesnt leave face feeling icky... Looks amazing when wearing.. I recommend! Thank you</li>
    <li> Christmas gift for granddaughter.  Sizes are bigger then I expected.  I was please about that.</li>
    <li> I have been buying Bare Minerals for many years, but lately I had noticed that the coverage wasn&#x27;t as good as it used to be.  I was having to use a lot more of the product to get the amount of coverage that I wanted. Since it is pretty expensive, this was beginning to bother me and I started looking for an alternative.  I came across IQ Mineral Makeup and decided to give it a try.  I loved it!  The coverage was great (the way Bare Minerals used to be).  The price was much better too.  I am now using the IQ brand every day and my makeup looks great!  I would definitely recommend this makeup.</li>
    <li> I do love this makeup, though I have to say the one powder is way too light. I use the darker one in the kit and it is perfect for me with no mixing in of the lighter color. The bronzer is perfect and I use very little to get the color I want. The setting veil is excellent and gives that no makeup look. The brushes are cheap but I had never planed on using them anyway, but in a pinch they do work. I like the concealer as well though I have not had to use it much it has worked super well when I needed it too. A little goes a long way with all the products and I will order again.</li>
    <li> When I received this product it only had the brushes which were inferior and the actual makeup was completely missing.  I would definitely not buy this again.</li>
    <li> This makeup is really good! I love it! Very natural...great coverage....just wish I could buy individually. ...on certain things..it is a little messy....overall I have found my new go to makeup:)</li>
    <li> This would be a good option for a teenager or a child, but you&#x27;re better off just buying bare minerals. This barely gave any coverage, made me look pale and colorless (and not due to an incorrect shade), and overall felt cheap.</li>
    <li> very good product but otherwise i would recommend packaging it better because one of the containers was opened a little and threw the makeup</li>
    <li> I like this product.  Packaging and shipping was good.  No complaints.</li>
    <li> Great product! Very glad to have found this because it gives great coverage and great pricing</li>
    <li> This product arrived on time and packaged well for shipment. I have been looking for mineral makeup and have used this product, IQ Natural...Pur Minerals...and Bare Minerals. I have found that Bare Minerals are the best if you want to spend the money for it. Their product has the best coverage and best brushes. Pur Minerals is a nice product also and slightly less expensive. This kit that I ordered was good for the price. The foundation provided less coverage, so if you have clear skin it will be fine to use. I found the medium kit to be a little light for my skin, where medium in other brands matches. The product containers are a little messy. There is no way to close the holes in the containers of foundation or veil, so I find putting cotton balls in them helps (especially if putting in your makeup bag). The warmth and eye shadow containers are full to the top, which is nice for the value, yet messy when opening (may transfer them to my own larger containers). I did find that I prefer the color of the warmth from this brand to be better than other brands. As for the foundation and blush brushes, I find them stiff and prickly. Did not like them for application of product, so I used my Bare Minerals natural hair brushes and the product applied nicely. The brushes for the eye shadows are fine but I prefer softer brushes for blending.  Overall, for the price, it is a nice product. For the value, I would choose it over Pur Minerals, as long as you already have quality brushes, and can accept that the product packaging is a little messy.</li>
    <li> This makeup doesnt blend into the skin as bare minerals does. It looks good once it is blended once all the makeup is on. A person has to brush the access makeup off as it is very powder like and seems to stay on the surface.</li>
    <li> I received everything like the description stated, but it should have been a beige color and came in as an ivory.</li>
    <li> Drawbacks:&lt;br /&gt;-The little containers they&#x27;re in kinda suck compared to the Bare Escentuals ones.  Low sides, things get kinda messy, and it&#x27;s hard to control the amount to sift out.&lt;br /&gt;-The brushes and the shiny red bag are garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, the coverage is solid and the colors are really lovely.  Great product for refilling your Bare Escentuals containers to save your wallet.  ;)</li>
    <li> The mineral powders are okay. Let&#x27;s not compare to Bare Minerals. The brushes could be of higher quality and then the powder would go on great!</li>
    <li> I saw the IQ starter kit when I went to reorder my Bare Minerals foundation and thought, for $20, you get a lot of stuff to try, so why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was sweet and the brushes came in a nice case. The makeup itself is definitely not the same quality as Bare Minerals, but in a pinch it will do just fine. The concealer, to start, is a bit chalky and doesn&#x27;t blend as well as the Summer Bisque by BM, and the Medium foundation is much lighter than BM Medium Tan, which is what I normally use. However, they supply you with an ample sampling of &#x27;Warm&#x27;, which, when blended on top of the foundation, gives a nice healthy glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say, overall, good product for what it costs. If you&#x27;re looking for the flawless coverage of BM, you may be disappointed, but it&#x27;s definitely worth a try!</li>
    <li> I really love the powder make up.  It&#x27;s light and comfortable. It does not dry out or make your skin oily.  Easy to use!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other mineral makeups in the past and this one by far is wonderful!  I&#x27;ve even given some to my daughter who has troubled skin....looks great!</li>
    <li> This set has awesome coverage. It takes a small amount to do my whole face!</li>
    <li> I am allergic to most make up and thought this would be better but it still made me break out.</li>
    <li> You really have to choose right color and apply very small portions. More on your brush leaves patches on the face. The quantity is a lot more than Bare Escentuals.  The quality of the brushes is not good, they are very rough on your face. Bare Escentuals brushes are very soft, but they don&#x27;t last long</li>
    <li> It was given as a stocking gift.  I will need to ask if they liked it.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> this make-up is the best make-up i have ever used in my life..it makes my skin feel clean, and my face look flawless!!..thank-you &#x27;IQ&#x27; Natural..sincerely, carla g.</li>
    <li> This product went above and beyond my expectations. It does last quite a while throughout the day, but as I have oily skin, I sometimes feel the need to re-apply in the afternoon.I give it 4 stars because the multi-tasking powder and bronzer are small containers which makes it hard to get out without being a mess. I was not a fan of the brushes that came with the set, but I have my own brushes that I like a lot better.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t care for this makeup at all. Not near as good as other mineral makeup. Don&#x27;t bother or be tempted by the price.</li>
    <li> This is a nice product. Not as good as bare minerals product I use, but does its job. The brushes are nice but a little stiff. The bronzer should be in a larger container for easier use. I do believe that if someone has never used a mineral makeup product, this would be a great start for anyone.</li>
    <li> Disappointed.  I have tried it twice, i will be going back to my bare minerals foundation. The IQ makeup looks blotchy after setting. Coverage isnt that great. The l&#x27;oreal mineral foundation seems similar. I do however like the eyeshadow and the eyeshadow brush, but that was it out of the kit. Pretty disappointed.  Back to my almost $30 foundation I go! Lesson learned.</li>
    <li> The brushes aren&#x27;t good quality, but the mineral make up&lt;br /&gt;Is good</li>
    <li> Love these products.  Low price for a huge amount of products plus brush set.Love the look snd feel of this make up.  No need to spend much more for high end Bare Minerals. This set is perfect !</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping that I would like it. I have some bare mineral products but I hate spending the money on it as it can get quite pricey. This set is WONDERFUL! I haven&#x27;t tried the brushes as I have a huge set but I definitely will buy more of their products again!</li>
    <li> Overall the kit is a good one.  The foundation colors are a bit off, have to mix them together to get a more natural color.  The bisque is really good though - does a great job covering darkness around the eyes and also red spots.  The best piece in the kit is the eye shadow - it&#x27;s fabulous!  The brushes are harsh, can&#x27;t use them at all which is disappointing as I really needed some new brushes.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely AMAZING. The makeup is lightweight and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts. Although I would suggest using a minimal amount because with this makeup a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> After reading a few of these reviews (the bad ones, mainly) I thought for sure I&#x27;d made a huge mistake, but it all worked out for the best. Despite having no real clue what my true skin color is (medium with warm undertones? olive with cool undertones? I&#x27;d like to make a phone call?), and despite being really pale in winter and nearly Hawaiian during the summer, the medium works for me. Considering how many pink-based foundations are out there, it&#x27;s always a leap of faith ordering something new without being able to test it, first. Sure, there is a slight orange tint in the foundation powder (the medium beige less so than the medium), but the edge of that is toned down by the veiling powder. The bronzer has enough clay color in it to make a decent blush for me, and the set comes with fine, glittery eyeshadow (if you&#x27;re into fine, glittery eyeshadow). Just know: if you&#x27;re getting the medium, it is very warm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foundation doesn&#x27;t have the greatest coverage for blemishes, but honestly, I haven&#x27;t really come across a liquid/mousse/airspray/BB cream foundation that covered them up completely. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s out there, but I&#x27;m not willing to spend more than drugstore prices for makeup these days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only took a star off for the brushes. I&#x27;m no brush snob, but these strike me as worse quality than I usually find in paint brushes. They should have just kept the whole brush set.</li>
    <li> Cheap product, I personally do not like it. No coverage, looks like I am not even wearing makeup. Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Came really fast and I love my product 😄</li>
    <li> I am in love with this product! It&#x27;s got here a day before scheduled and it is flawless! It goes on so nicely and evenly I don&#x27;t even feel like I&#x27;m wearing makeup! The brushes are soft to the touch. I&#x27;ll never buy any other make up again. I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better product.</li>
    <li> Mom loved her gift. She wishes it had more :) just too time consuming. But other than that, shipped quick. I would of preferred them in a more attractive bagging instead of a ziplock though.</li>
    <li> not what i was looking for</li>
