      <li>The clips and color are excellent as well high quality product at a price you can afford!!!</li>
      <li>The quality of the hair is great, I love that.</li>
      <li>Love the hair!</li>
      <li>great quality, worth the money for sure!</li>
      <li>These are so soft and very good quality.</li>
      <li>Still love and planing on buy another set</li>
      <li>I just wish there was more hair on each clip.</li>
      <li>My daughter likes them and we would purchase again if they had more pieces that came with it.</li>
      <li>So I have never bought hair before and I am very excited about it.</li>
      <li>- the original was shinier than my own.</li>
      <li>This hair was excellent quality, clean, absolutely NO dirt or evidence nits, even before I washed it.</li>
      <li>So much fun!</li>
      <li>I am definitely pleased with my purchase and how fast I got them!</li>
      <li>The clips broke really quick also...</li>
      <li>Nice for about a week - it IS human hair</li>
      <li>I bought these strictly for fun</li>
      <li>I think I need practice putting them in :) and the color is a little more red than my nature color, but it kind of gives an hombre look</li>
      <li>They are thin so if you plan to use them as a full set as opposed to filler pieces as I did, get two sets and you&#x27;re good to go!</li>
      <li>The snaps are super strong so there is no slipping or falling out.</li>
      <li>They came perfectly packaged, not tangled at all and only smelled a little like plastic.</li>
      <li>I was completely satisfied with my purchase that extensions were soft and wear really well.</li>
      <li>They wash easy and they&#x27;re extremely soft.</li>
      <li>There is no way I will be able to get the length I want without making it obvious that I have extensions it.</li>
      <li>but it has been through so many processes it is dry as all hell after that -</li>
      <li>And the length is just right, just wish there was more hair, less clips.</li>
      <li>I washed them and dried them and a little dye came out but that just made it look even more like my own hair</li>
      <li>Hair curled and otherwise styled like normal hair,</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different brands and different types and these are by far one of my favorites.</li>
      <li>They are just as good as the super expensive remy ones from Sally just way cheaper!</li>
      <li>so far I like it!</li>
      <li>and they look natural and sleek</li>
      <li>wherever you&#x27;d like, but for me at least, after i&#x27;ve placed all of the clips in, my head feels heavier and just touching the back of my head you can feel the clips there.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t have hardly any expectations for these considering how cheap the were.</li>
      <li>I ordered these as filler pieces for my current set of extensions and all I can say is wow.</li>

<li> They do have a little bit of a red tint but after a couple washes I noticed it faded away to just brown</li>
<li> Not worth the cost.</li>
<li> This one didn&#x27;t have many reviews but other, similar extensions had some awful reviews</li>
<li> but this ever again however the reason i give 2 stars is because they worked for a little while</li>
<li> If you have thick hair you may have to get two packs but that&#x27;s inevitable no matter who or where you purchase them, but you would have to spend 200$ at least anywhere else.</li>
<li> They are very thin and does not have enough pieces to them.</li>
<li> I bought 2 7 packs based on other reviews that it was thin.</li>
<li> Too thin, I suggest buyers to either go to Sally&#x27;s or buy two packs off here</li>
<li> Way too thin.</li>
<li> I mean come on its fake hair</li>
<li> When in recieved the hair it was in a plastic package with a bit of a weird smell.  </li>
<li> /&gt;However, this hair was very thin.</li>
<li> The color was a bit lighter than it appeared and the pieces were thin but not as bad as they could have been.</li>
<li> they were awful.</li>

    <li> Even though my hair is super thin, it&#x27;s not enough. Still love and planing on buy another set</li>
    <li> Love the hair,matched my hair perfectly which I was scared it wouldn&#x27;t .its so soft and silky and its not poofy like other ones that my hair so big! I ordered two and they look natural and sleek</li>
    <li> Loved tgem best ive ever bought</li>
    <li> I just wish there was more hair on each clip. There&#x27;s a lot of clips, so you can place them however and wherever you&#x27;d like, but for me at least, after i&#x27;ve placed all of the clips in, my head feels heavier and just touching the back of my head you can feel the clips there. The quality of the hair is great, I love that. And the length is just right, just wish there was more hair, less clips.</li>
    <li> Nice for about a week - it IS human hair but it has been through so many processes it is dry as all hell after that - i would NOT but this ever again however the reason i give 2 stars is because they worked for a little while</li>
    <li> I bought these strictly for fun so I felt like this was a good price to pay in case they were awful. This one didn&#x27;t have many reviews but other, similar extensions had some awful reviews so I was nervous about buying online.  They came perfectly packaged, not tangled at all and only smelled a little like plastic. The color match to my hair was perfect! I washed them and dried them and a little dye came out but that just made it look even more like my own hair - the original was shinier than my own. Once I put them in, you could not tell where my hair ended and the extensions began. So much fun! If you are looking to buy online - pick these!</li>
    <li> They are very thin and does not have enough pieces to them. My daughter likes them and we would purchase again if they had more pieces that came with it.</li>
    <li> great quality, worth the money for sure! it matched my hair perfect, shipped and received the item promptly! will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> This hair was excellent quality, clean, absolutely NO dirt or evidence nits, even before I washed it. Clips were well made and the color was as described. Hair curled and otherwise styled like normal hair, no damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this hair was very thin. There is no way I will be able to get the length I want without making it obvious that I have extensions it. But it will do well to add dimension to my hair.</li>
    <li> I have worn extensions for a very long time. I&#x27;ve tried many different brands and different types and these are by far one of my favorites. They are just as good as the super expensive remy ones from Sally just way cheaper!

    <li> Love the hair! I got it for my daughter and she loves the way it looks, beautiful color and perfect length!  The snaps are super strong so there is no slipping or falling out.</li>
    <li> So I have never bought hair before and I am very excited about it. I bought 2 7 packs based on other reviews that it was thin. so far I like it! I mean come on its fake hair you cant expect it to be amazing, but I am happy with it. I think I need practice putting them in :) and the color is a little more red than my nature color, but it kind of gives an hombre look so I like it. Over all I would recommend these extensions, I think they are great and a good price over all</li>
    <li> L O V E these hair extensions! They are 100% human hair and they curl, crimp, straighten anything you want to do with them ! They wash easy and they&#x27;re extremely soft. They do have a little bit of a red tint but after a couple washes I noticed it faded away to just brown :) hope I helped some people make a decision on purchasing them or not !!</li>
    <li> I was completely satisfied with my purchase that extensions were soft and wear really well. The clips and color are excellent as well high quality product at a price you can afford!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered these as filler pieces for my current set of extensions and all I can say is wow. These are so soft and very good quality. I didn&#x27;t have hardly any expectations for these considering how cheap the were. They are thin so if you plan to use them as a full set as opposed to filler pieces as I did, get two sets and you&#x27;re good to go! I wish I had just ordered two sets of these to begin with before spending $150 on one set and then still having to buy these as filler pieces. Great product!</li>
    <li> Too thin, I suggest buyers to either go to Sally&#x27;s or buy two packs off here</li>
    <li> Good price, but i have alot of hair so i had to buy 2.</li>
    <li> The color was a bit lighter than it appeared and the pieces were thin but not as bad as they could have been.</li>
    <li> Not the best. You can&#x27;t straighten them or curl them... The hair will start to fall out and look gross!! The clips broke really quick also... Not the best.</li>
    <li> Best clip-und I have bought ! When in recieved the hair it was in a plastic package with a bit of a weird smell.  I co washed it to get the smell out of the hair. Which I recommend you do. And when I applied the clip ins to my hair they were perfect. I reccommend this product to anyone!</li>
