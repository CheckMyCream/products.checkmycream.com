<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am loving the body scub because it makes a big difference when I wash my skin. I do feel a difference using these gloves as oppose to using wash clothes. My skin is more flawless and glowing.</li>
    <li> Great product! Would definetly buy again, I was going to buy loofas but I saw the gloves and it&#x27;s so much better, they look small but they strech and don&#x27;t slip.</li>
    <li> So I was looking to exfoliate a little more than I have in the past. I went to the local big box store and picked up a loofah washcloth thingy with the thinking that a loofah washcloth is much better than a cloth one. Not so...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next I got one of those big ball loofah things. Eh... NO!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I saw this. My first thought was that there is no way that the quality of these loofah gloves could be very good. Then I read the reviews and saw that maybe these are good afterall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I bought them. I&#x27;m glad I did. I don&#x27;t often do things to change up my shower routine. I&#x27;m a guy and I just don&#x27;t care that much. As long as I&#x27;m clean, it&#x27;s all good. I am very impressed with the sturdiness of these gloves. I expect that a pair of gloves will easily last a month with daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I could change anything, I would ask the manufacturer to make packages in one color. White for instance. Sure, I&#x27;ll use the pink pair when it comes around to needing them. But I won&#x27;t like it... &#x3D;/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product. Give it a try!</li>
    <li> AMAZING exfoliating gloves! After the first use, my skin feels super soft and smooth! I also love that the gloves are reusable. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> These have actually changed my life. Seems silly, but I was having a hard time finding a scrubby that I could keep sanitized. These ones are easy to clean, very reasonably priced, and boy do they get the job done. My body is sooooooo much softer now. I use them on my face, and I think I look younger. All my little skin cells are waking up from these. I love them, and I love being able to give my skin the attention it deserves easy peasey in the shower. Thank you, family owned business :)) xo</li>
    <li> Did not really exfoliate as the description promised.</li>
    <li> Will continue to use and repurchase these gloves. After only one use I was able to notice an incredible difference in the texture of my skin. I used these on my legs prior to shaving and WOW what a difference. Easy to use and clean. And since they were so affordable I won&#x27;t mind throwing these out after a number of uses.</li>
    <li> Poor quality. Barely removes any skin</li>
    <li> These exfoliating gloves aren&#x27;t the best but not bad for the price. I had quite a few areas unravel quickly so long-lasting they are not. Could be thicker and need a loop to hang them up to dry.</li>
    <li> These work well. I use them often and like how my skin feels after using them.</li>
    <li> I use these gloves on my feet to exfoliate. I am a diabetic and can&#x27;t use anything real harsh. These do a real good job.</li>
    <li> Friends kept asking me how I got my (56 year-old) skin so soft - when they touched my arm or my hand, for example. So, I bought them all these gloves. They are thrilled. They really work well. I only use them about once a week or so. Never have my legs and arms been so soft.</li>
    <li> So far so good. My skin is smoother. This product has changed the way that I groom myself. I no longer use washcloths. I use this as an allover body exfoliator. I have ordered this product for my entire family.</li>
    <li> Loving it. I had to replace my last pair and I&#x27;m so glad this was available in bulk. Typically, you should change out your face and body scrubbers at least every 3 month. With four pairs, I know I won&#x27;t have to buy any for some time. The size is perfect for small and medium hands. However, I&#x27;m sure they may stretch out for larger hands. They lather up very well and provide thorough exfoliation without any scratching. The material is consistent throughout and I haven&#x27;t had any accidental skin abrasions from using it.</li>
    <li> I recently got into the world of waxing, I didn&#x27;t think I was going to get ingrown hairs but I did. I also did not believe I needed exfo gloves but most of my red bumps were ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought these gloves and boy did they deliver, majority of my red bumps went away and I was able to tackle my ingrowns. Well def buy again.</li>
    <li> I needed some more exfoliating gloves and this pack was a great deal. They are soft and don&#x27;t break down or wear out right away.</li>
    <li> I just love these gloves! I wish I&#x27;d known about them years ago.  It&#x27;s a self massage.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great deal and very good pack. The only thing is it is not manufactured to last for more than a month. It comes in 4 pairs though so fair enough for the price.</li>
    <li> Perfect for beginner underwater hockey gloves. Use GE silicone I and windex to smooth the silicone. Can&#x27;t comment on it&#x27;s intended use, sorry!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for, these exfoliating gloves are a great tight fit around my petite hands and do not shift around or become loose while using.  My broad handed husband cannot get these on his hand but praises the texture. Wish the gloves came in a larger size for men.</li>
    <li> Very good service and great product - thanks</li>
    <li> Works satisfactorily for the cost... though not the most masculine of colors for the male half of humanity.</li>
    <li> These gloves are great, . They really do exfoliate your skin very well.</li>
    <li> Not as abrasive as I was expecting</li>
    <li> Great item, great price, fast service, will order again</li>
    <li> A little tight on the hands but they do the job..</li>
    <li> Great experience. Fast shipping. Item just as described.</li>
    <li> Great gloves at a great price!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these before &amp; I wanted to replace my old ones, but I kept forgetting!  Then one day I saw them here at Amazon &amp; ordered the 4-pack; much cheaper, they last a long time, and my skin feels nicer!  I&#x27;ve got a pair in the shower &amp; another in the tub AND backups!  Great product &amp; I like that they come in different colors!</li>
    <li> These gloves are wonderful and were exactly what I was looking for. My skin felt better after the first use.</li>
    <li> The company is very professional. I received a follow-up courtesy email from them directly letting me know of their desire to satisfy me, their customer. Well, I am greatly satisfied!  Love the feel of the gloves, they do exfoliate.  I&#x27;ve had mine for two weeks, use daily, and still feel brand new.  Nothing scrubs my body better than these gloves.  After a shower, I truly feel clean.</li>
    <li> Just perfect. Exactly as described, actually fit my hands and didn&#x27;t give me that webbed finger look. Felt great. Everything was just great!</li>
    <li> I love the gloves!! But I gave it 3 stars because I&#x27;ve only had them 2 days and there is a hole in them in the corner of the thumb. What will you do about it? I bought them because the others tore up un-mercilessly. They get your skin super clean [be careful - they may take off skin if you scrub your face too hard. My face was red everywhere I scrubbed.] But otherwise, they work great. I love them. I also received just the right colors. They are beautiful! They are just the ones I would&#x27;ve chosen. The blue is beautiful. But I won&#x27;t have any gloves soon. They are the first pair. Help!!!!</li>
    <li> I received these items in 1 day!!!  Great product too.</li>
    <li> Nice quality scrub gloves. Prompt shipping. Love having multiple pairs. Very good price, much cheaper than buying in a store.</li>
    <li> It was nice to find a 4-pack, as these shower gloves should be changed out every few months, like a toothbrush :) They don&#x27;t snag often or fall apart with daily use. They&#x27;re the right thickness and well-made.</li>
    <li> Love these gloves for gentle exfoliation especially important in the summer time when we love to use self tanners.  The gloves are easily washed in the gentle cycle and then I lay it out to air dry in between uses so that I always have a clean pair for the next pampering experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use these gloves to bath my horse.  I dilute the shampoo into a bucket of warm water and dunk an oversize sea sponge into the soapy water and then gently splash the water onto the horse with one hand and use the glove on the other hand to massage the soapy water over her coat.  Spa day for my beautiful mare could not be more enjoyable for either my horse or myself with the use of these gloves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another use is to use this glove while running vegetables thru the mandoline.  I have never sliced my finger on the extremely sharp blades of my mandoline with one of these gloves on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another advantage of the 4-pack is that you can keep certain colors specific for certain uses.  For example, even though I send the mits thru the wash after each use I would not use the same mit color for slicing the vegetables after using it on my horse.</li>
    <li> Both my husband and I like the gloves for bathing. The quality seems good and they definitely exfoliate your skin and leave it much smoother. Overall very pleased, and we feel good about the value received.</li>
    <li> A pair in each Christmas stocking! Oh, how I love these things!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these gloves. The work the best with my apricot scrub. The pack contains 4 different colored scrubbing gloves. These gloves can be used for the entire body not just the face. Loofahs should be changed often so that is great because there are 4 of these. You can handwash them or throw them in the washing machine to be washed. I definitely feel my skin to be smoother once I used these. Now they are part my normal routine.&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided without any obligations.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product.  It leaves your skin so nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> My skin is noticeably softer and smoother after using these gloves for only a week or two.</li>
    <li> These are perfect for what I wanted, four pair!!!!  Good quality!!!  Great fit ( I have big hands)!!!!  As my mother would say, &amp;#34;you can&#x27;t beat that with a stick&amp;#34;.  Exfoliates with out being abrasive to your skin, the rough places are feeling soft and smooth to the touch. I ordered late Tuesday, received them early Thursday, rinsed them and used them right away. Thank you.</li>
    <li> These gloves are probably okay for occasional use. I can&#x27;t imagine them being good for daily use as they can be a little harsh on your skin with a little pressure. But they are reasonable and of disposable nature, so they serve the purpose.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 pkgs of 4 pair each for gifts and decided to keep a pair for myself to try.  I used once and decided I should keep two pair for myself! I found them to be just awesome! And they made my skin feel wonderful! The fabric is stretchy and fit my large size hands with no problem.  I use my favorite body wash with them and I can actually feel the difference in how the gloves move over my skin before and after. It was truly amazing to feel such a drastic difference and my skin just feels renewed and fresh after using these wonderful gloves.  I like the gloves better than the mesh pom-poms - you have more control and the gloves just work better for me.  I used all over my body but did not use on my face as I read somewhere the gloves were not recommended for your face. They dry quickly and do up nicely. I really enjoyed using this product - made me feel wonderful all under! I highly recommend and would be perfect before applying the self tanning lotions. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully for exfoliating.  Makes your skin all over feel super smooth.  I love them.</li>
    <li> I LOVE using these Body Scrub Exfoliating Gloves Both In and Out of the shower!&lt;br /&gt;They are well made and fit my hands extremely well.&lt;br /&gt;They hold their shape when wet and really do a great job of gently exfoliating dead skin cells without scratching my delicate skin.&lt;br /&gt;When using in the shower, I find I need less shower scrub than I did with my nylon shower buff and unlike the buff, the soap rinses out quickly when I remove them, so I am also conserving water.&lt;br /&gt;I love that SmitCo LLC  has designed these Exfoliating Gloves with Multiple Rows of Thin Elastic Bands in the 2 1/2&amp;#34; wide wrist bands! Their usage of thinner but strong elastic helps to hold these Exfoliating Gloves in place without leaving red lines on my wrists. I also appreciate that the edges of the wrist portion are well hemmed, but not bulky.&lt;br /&gt;Since receiving these Exfoliating Gloves, I have started using a pair on my dry skin in the evening before I go to bed. Especially on my legs, as I sit most of the day and they work well to stimulate the blood flow.  I have an issue with leg cramps when I sleep and I am finding that if I rub my legs with these Exfoliating Gloves before sleeping, the cramps are less severe.&lt;br /&gt;For the under $15 asking price you are getting FOUR pair of these awesome Exfoliating Gloves and they arrive in a reusable storage pouch with a snap closure. The colors I received are very attractive pastels in Pink. Purple, Green and Blue.&lt;br /&gt;They are machine washable and dry able, however as I have commercial machines where I live that tend to be hard on our clothes, I prefer to wash them by hand with detergent in hot water and hang them to dry.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a promotional discount in exchange for testing and review, and am giving them a well deserved 5 Star rating.&lt;br /&gt;I will be telling my friends and family just how wonderful these Body Scrub-Exfoliating Gloves are and encouraging them to purchase a set of their own!</li>
    <li> These are exactly WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR WHEN I ORDERED THEM. They work well. I use thwm several times a weel</li>
    <li> I wish these didn&#x27;t come in such girly colors, but I love these gloves. Its nice to have clean and smooth skin, and these gloves are responsible for it. I think its crazy how exfoliating gloves are viewed as a feminine product. Anyone who is looking to have clean smooth skin needs to buy these. I love how you get 4 pairs. I usually use a pair for about a month before I throw them out. I strongly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> They get the dirt of, I see it when i rinse them....it&#x27;s just my hands are so tight in the glove, I wish they were a little bigger</li>
    <li> Great set of exfoliating gloves. Use them weekly and they work like expected. Washer/dryer safe from my experience.</li>
    <li> Works better than a loofah....The first time I used this it felt almost like sandpaper, but I got use to it. These will make your skin incredibly soft.</li>
    <li> I love exfoliating gloves but hate coughing up the $8 they cost at the store by my apt.  These are such a great deal.  They are 4 pairs of gloves (8 gloves total).  They are definately for someone with small hands which is perfect for me.</li>
    <li> Awesome for the price. 4 sets of gloves, you kidding me? I gave one to different people in my family and kept a set. At first it felt as if the gloves didn&#x27;t make enough soap foam, but I got used to it eventually and now they do and one squirt of soap will do to cover my whole body. Also at first it feels weird to not grab something to scrub, but you get over it. It hurts at first if you scrub hard, but it&#x27;s good because you&#x27;re really cleaning yourself. Would recommend. Have owned for a month or so and they haven&#x27;t ripped or seem like they will. I also have huge hands and they fit, albeit tight.</li>
    <li> These gloves are exactly what I was looking for to help create a nice lather with my homemade soap bars. I find that the best way to use them is to first create a lather on my hands with the soap and then slip them on so that they do not tear on my dry hands.</li>
    <li> I received my pack of glove about a week ago and they are terrific.  The quality is great.</li>
    <li> Great fit, great value!</li>
    <li> good product, but the nylon snags some times</li>
    <li> I wish it didn&#x27;t have the pink gloves..... I can live with all the others...... I am a manly man who loves to exfoliate.... These gloves seem high quality.  I started with the pink pair.  They fit my hands well and seem to be made with quality.</li>
    <li> Works just as advertised -- great price for multiple pairs!</li>
    <li> terrible product. very synthetic. feels awful on the skin.</li>
    <li> I am enjoying the gloves and love the colors.  Very happy customer.</li>
    <li> awesome, makes you feel really clean with so little effort</li>
    <li> Love the colors of the 4 pairs I got - exactly like the photo. Texture and size are perfect for me but I have small hands.</li>
    <li> My skin feels so clean after my shower using these gloves.  Best part?  They are washable.</li>
    <li> they came fast, seem like good quality and they worked well</li>
    <li> They were to soft and tore easily i throw them away after first use</li>
    <li> I ordered these gloves because the ones in the stores have gotten progressively cheaper (and by that I mean junky) over the years.  The elastic on them only lasts through one wash, they are so loose and big you would almost have to be a linebacker for them to fit, and there is no texture to them at all.  So I thought I would give these a try, and I&#x27;m glad I did. The fit snugly and they actually feel like they will exfoliate, as they are supposed to.  I just got them, so I can&#x27;t comment on how well they wear, but so far, so good......</li>
    <li> I will not use anything else to remove dead skin cells. These leave my skin soft and smooth. And given that I am 55 years old, that&#x27;s saying something. I highly recommend these gloves.</li>
    <li> I bought these glove because my best brand of gloves were not in stock at the stor where they&#x27;re usually available. When I tried these, my skin was cleaner than before. These gloves removes all the dead skin making my skin much healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These gloves will last me a very long time and I will reorder them and will recommend.</li>
    <li> “I paid $20 at a spa for a rubdown with these gloves (dry body brushing) and decided to see if I could do better myself. What a steal to get 3 pairs of gloves for less than the price of the spa treatment! Definitely recommend.”</li>
    <li> So easy to use in the shower as these gloves hold the soap suds really well so there is no need for frequent re-soaping.  I kept two pairs and used the extras for gifts to include with organic homemade soaps.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed !</li>
    <li> Great gloves - not too rough but not too soft either.  Great value for the money - would recommend and will be buying again.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these gloves.  After usage makes my skin feel so soft and glowing</li>
    <li> The gloves appear to be small but once wet will stretch over large hands. Work great for mild scrubbing.</li>
    <li> Love these.  Makes me feel extra clean</li>
    <li> Great gloves! Do exactly what you&#x27;d expect and I love that you get multiples in the package!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for at a good price. Quality product.</li>
    <li> This is a great value for the price.  There are 4 pair of exfoliating gloves.  They are great.  If you have any rough skin on your body you can use these to remove it and make your skin as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
    <li> ~GREAT PRODUCT~LOVE IT~</li>
    <li> Very thick and don&#x27;t stretch out like most gloves. Very textured to really get off the dead skin.</li>
    <li> Received my order quickly and very satisfied with these gloves. Like the soft smooth texture of my skin now.</li>
    <li> Good quality product. Good price! Would order again.</li>
    <li> Great delivery and quality, but I didn&#x27;t get other colors like shown</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t come with a hanger thingie to hook them up to dry, but they&#x27;re effective. Please note that men might find these especially challenging. My boyfriend had a Hand Hulk moment with his first pair, ripping them to sudsy shreds.</li>
    <li> Wow - I have never exfoliated &amp; I was tingling all over after using these gloves which I&#x27;m doing several times a week now.  My skin is softer, the color more consistent &amp; I actually feel cleaner all over.  Buy &amp; you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I thought this is a great deal but unfortunately they fall apart after first use. bummer</li>
    <li> Cute colors and work great with my body scrub!</li>
    <li> I bought these for exfoliating before applying self-tanner.  I have yet to use the self-tanner but use these regularly anyways.  Great deal for three pairs!  I really like that they fit snug on my hands.  I previously had a pair that was too big which was cumbersome.  I&#x27;d buy these again but not sure when I&#x27;ll have to because I have three and they are a good quality, holding up.  Would be good in a homemade beauty gift bag!</li>
    <li> This was a GREAT deal!  I originally bought these at the end of the summer to prep for self-tanning at home (im pasty white had an event where my chicken legs would be on display).  I only tanned a few times, but I continue to use these gloves.  You know those long showers you take that make you feel renewed?  These add to that feeling 100x over.  You&#x27;ll get the hang of the pressure you want for level of exfoliation after you try them a few times. I just rub bar soap in my hands with them on or blob shower gel on them and wash my whole body.  very easy.  I gave away a pair to my sister who also liked them.  I have a feeling they will last quite a while but when I&#x27;m ready to re-order I will be back here.  Thanks for a great affordable product.</li>
    <li> Product is wonderful! Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Just what i was looking for at a great price thanks!</li>
    <li> I am loving my gloves! I have not had any issues with them and they arrived on time.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these gloves..... and the price can&#x27;t be beat!! Will be ordering again</li>
    <li> “Yes, I was in need of a pair as my old one are showing some wear and tear. I ordered these as an item for a gift basket and got one for myself. These are great exfoliators for your body. If we pamper our hands and feet why not the body. Skin becomes very soft after rinsing. My son asked me &amp;#34;why is your arm so soft? I said &amp;#34; I exfoliate&amp;#34;. Great gift idea.”</li>
    <li> As good in quality as the ones I get from Rite Aid or CVS - when I can find them. Rough, but not too rough for my face when wet with hot water.</li>
    <li> “I received the 4-pack of gloves promptly from this vendor and would order from them again. The gloves are of very nice quality and have elastic at the wrists which help them to stay on in the shower.”</li>
