<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I ordered a braun toothbrush last year along with spare brush heads. They were for sensitive teeth. I reordered these flossing heads. They&#x27;re Not for sensitive teeth or gums. But your gums get used to them in about a week. Both the heads for sensitive teeth and these flossing heads do a good job of getting at the bits of food which get lodged between your teeth. These flossing heads just do that job a bit more aggressively.  And I might add, while these do the more thorough flossing, the others do a slightly better job of cleaning the tooth surfaces, polishing. I will say this. This electric tooth brush is well worth the price, and is every bit as good as the much pricier versions, which take up more space on the counter. The one I ordered last year replaced one like it, which lasted seven years. The expensive model that one replaced lasted four. Do the math.</li>
    <li> Works.  New type of head for me.  Like it.</li>
    <li> This flosses teeth with the best of em :) It does it&#x27;s job and is well made. Nothing extravagant or special about it, and am satisfied with the purchase and the price.</li>
    <li> Like the smaller head.</li>
    <li> Packaged as advertised. Quality product</li>
    <li> Great price and timely delivery!</li>
    <li> Just what I needed.  Does a great job!</li>
    <li> They seem genuine, which anyone who has purchased others knows is very important.</li>
    <li> great price (with the free shipping... i bought 2 packs and shared them with my 2 sisters)</li>
    <li> Best brush on the market.</li>
    <li> Was added as extra brushes, which they loved</li>
    <li> These heads work well.  They don&#x27;t seem to last all that long.  The coloring that indicates when to replace them seems to think I should replace every month or so.  With how expensive these are I&#x27;m inclined to wait quite a bit longer.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping but don&#x27;t know why item use not last long. 2 month spent 5 of them...</li>
    <li> Great price and it came on time, thank you!</li>
    <li> Excellent! Just like the ones from a real store, but cheaper!</li>
    <li> DO NOT USE THIS AS A TOOTHBRUSH REPLACEMENT!  Your teeth will yellow and build up with so much plaque.</li>
    <li> good value and product</li>
    <li> Got to have them and like this type. Would order again.</li>
    <li> I hate flossing so this brush head does the trick for me.</li>
    <li> Nice product. Worked as expected.</li>
    <li> For the amount of heads you get for the money , this is a great buy. Now I don&#x27;t have to worry about running out of brushes</li>
    <li> They brush my teeth exactly as expected, my dentist approves of the outcomes of using these.  Electric toothbrushes rock and good heads are where the magic happens.  These are good heads.</li>
    <li> not bad. It is comfortable for my poor teeth .</li>
    <li> Replaced my 11 year old Oral B. I liked the first one, the next generation is even better.</li>
    <li> The Floss Action was a little harsh on the gums the first few uses - after that it seems to work very well.</li>
    <li> fit my oral b 3d excel 10 year old wireless brush</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s simply perfect. I&#x27;ve Allways wanted to have this but I had to pay a lot cause nobody in my country sells these product. But it&#x27;s worth it!!</li>
    <li> As good as what I pay more for at Walmart!  They fit perfectly and had no problems with the functionality.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality. So much superior to generic, drug-store brand replacement heads I tried once.</li>
    <li> WELL THIS PRODUCT U CANT SAY THAT MUCH ABOUT.... IT DOES WHAT IT&#x27;S SUPPOSED TO DO...LOL&lt;br /&gt;THE PRICE WAS GREAT ITS DEFINTELY A BARGAIN!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these heads with my Oral-B Pro 5000 for years and love them! I&#x27;m absolutely terrible about flossing. I used to use a water flosser and kind of gave up on that too. But every checkup with my dentist and hygienist, they see little to no plaque!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Up&amp;Up version Target has doesn&#x27;t do as good a job IMO, being too soft, wear out faster, and with ill-fitting connection to my toothbrush. But the Oral-B replacements I get at Target perform solidly.</li>
    <li> I know there are other brands and have asked my dentist if I need to change?</li>
    <li> Not as good of a brushing experience as the regular brush.</li>
    <li> I felt the product lived up to the description and my expectations.  I am happy with the product and with the service.</li>
    <li> - High quality product&lt;br /&gt;- Leave your teeth thoroughly clean and shiny&lt;br /&gt;- To all those who require deep cleaning and have healthy teeth</li>
    <li> Very good price for a great product.  The price was much better than the local discount store.  Five heads will last for a while.</li>
    <li> I prefer it over the original brush head</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t have a Vitality toothbrush, get one. Your teeth feel so much better. My dentist recommended it and now I&#x27;m actually dreading camping since I won&#x27;t be able to take it with me! LOL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My boyfriend was also recently complimented on his teeth by his dentist (different one from mine) and complimented him for using a Vitality. It&#x27;s certainly a pricey toothbrush, but honestly 100% worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We use the floss action as a standard head in our house, but the polishing cup for whitening your teeth is also amazing. A++ for Oral B&#x27;s products!!!</li>
    <li> Good brush heads. I prefer these and the power clean heads.</li>
    <li> Still no idea why these are so damn expensive but these get the job done</li>
    <li> great replacement heads versus the standard ones. The &amp;#34;floss action&amp;#34; really helps make my teeth feel cleaner.</li>
    <li> Granted I have sensitive gums, but these things felt like jack hammers pounding away at my gums. There is almost no give whatsoever on the bristles so they don&#x27;t wrap around the teeth. The brush would just bounce off my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad I bought the 5 pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive gums, try these instead: [[ASIN:B00006ANDK B00006ANDK]]</li>
    <li> They are toothbrush heads, not much to say. I do wish they weren&#x27;t so expensive but what are you gonna do?</li>
    <li> Keeps my teeth from falling out and the plague demons at bay, great product!</li>
    <li> Good replacement heads.</li>
    <li> I have used these brushes for a long time and love them. I think they clean my teeth better than any other brush.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried the round soft ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried the full manual toothbrush head-sized ones with the dual action movement (up-down on the rectangular bottom/and oscillating motion at the top).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those both work...and yes, you&#x27;ll get about 6 months of service from them, too. Just remember to run the head (minus the battery base, of course !!!) through the dishwasher on sani-hot-mode once a month or so to keep the head sanitized and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just keep coming back to this style head, though. The little plastic flossing probes on this head nearly eliminate the need to do &amp;#34;string-flossing&amp;#34;. Instead of daily string-flossing, you can go down to once every one or two weeks for that unless you feel pressure from stuck food between your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your gums remain pink, tight, and healthy with this head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy them; you won&#x27;t regret it!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great deal for these brush heads. The ability to utilize my Amazon Prime saved me a trip to the store.</li>
    <li> The brush action is irregular, causing the brush to bounce off my teeth.  Also the bristles are much harder than the original Oral-B.  I&#x27;m not too happy.</li>
    <li> My sister is a dental Hygenist and recommended that I start flossing more. I also use chewing tobacco. After using the electric toothbrush and these brush heads for 6+ months, the difference is outstanding when compared to standard toothbrushes. It keeps the plaque from chewing away, and my mouth feels much cleaner from using these as opossed to the standard brush.</li>
    <li> Works.  Oral-B replacements are pricey but it&#x27;s worth it when I get my check ups.</li>
    <li> Very happy with item!</li>
    <li> Great product, just like described, very good seller . Thank you</li>
    <li> I always use this product and I can just offer to everybody</li>
    <li> Best brand money can buy.</li>
    <li> This is a well-made, durable Oral-B product made in Germany.  I have used this product several times over the last couple of years trying to get accustomed to it.  I find the brushing experience of this product to be a little harsh.  However, using this brush head is NOT an unpleasant experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the Oral-B Sensitive brush heads (with the same Amazon 4-star plus customer ratings) that I have been using for at least 10 years over this product as it provides a smoother brushing experience that encourages me to spend the time required to properly brush my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manufacturer utilizes minimal packaging with little waste ... even though each brush head is individually packaged.  Responsible packaging is important to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave this product a 4-star rating is the cost.  In my opinion, $6.66 a brush head is more expensive than it needs to be.</li>
    <li> Good quality soft brushes for everyday use.</li>
    <li> They are less expensive this way than in any store. But you probably do not need me to tell you this.</li>
    <li> The toothbrush head for Oral-B 5000, good quality, cost-effective in general</li>
    <li> great product and service</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve got a compatible Oral-B brush handle at home, these work perfectly.  My gums can sometimes be sensitive, and these brushes stimulate my gums without irritating them.</li>
    <li> Love them. Keep my teeth very clean.</li>
    <li> I like these heads, they work and are easy to use and easy on my teeth. I am happy will get again.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product.</li>
    <li> But these were quality-made and well priced.  I&#x27;ve had so many problems with shoddily made standard heads, that I decided to try the floss action ones.  Although that aspect is not all that important to me, the reliability of the heads makes it worth buying.</li>
    <li> One more practical and well done product of this brand. Small and simple to be managed and carried to everywhere.</li>
    <li> My teeth are clean.  What else can I say?  The toothbrush heads were received when they were expected and worked as expected.</li>
    <li> These replacement heads are terrific, do a wonderful job, never scratch your gums.  Cannot find a better toothbrush head&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;mom mom</li>
    <li> It works great, top quality toothbrush replacement heads</li>
    <li> This is a great deal for the price. I like this particular type of brush with the floss action paddles.</li>
    <li> Love my oral B....good price. Only brush I will ever use. Well made.</li>
    <li> I have been using these types of brush heads for many years.  I think they clean my teeth thoroughly.  I know they are on the bit expensive side but you have more than a years worth if you change your head every 3 months.  I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> A must for our toothbrushes, however, a pricy solution..</li>
    <li> Perfect fit for my toothbrush and enough replacement heads to last more than a year in our house.  Great purchase.</li>
    <li> LOVE this brand.  Do NOT by knock-offs -- they come apart in your mouth!  Worth the few $ extra for name brand in this case!</li>
    <li> Good package. Worth of money.</li>
    <li> We love our Oral-B and the replacement brushes with floss action are the same great quality as the ones that come with the brush.</li>
    <li> We ordered this along with the toothbrush base, so that we&#x27;d have spares when we needed to change them out (always good to change your toothbrush heads at least quarterly).  They look exactly like the one that came with the toothbrush base.</li>
    <li> good quality - there is not much more to say - it is a brand name and lives up to its name - i will definitely purchase again</li>
    <li> I love using the power brushes, because I like do things efficiently. I get a much better cleaning with much less effort than with a &amp;#34;manual&amp;#34; brush. I use these heads because they are supposed to be Oral-B&#x27;s best. Well, they work well for me and my family. No complaints and will continue purchasing them. I don&#x27;t follow the blue indicator when it means to replace the brush head, I just replace at about 6 months (about the time the bristles look a bit flimsy).</li>
    <li> I believe it is very good for teeth.</li>
    <li> Same as you get at the store, really wish amazon was cheaper, but the price of these replacement brushes is outrageous. If my wife didn&#x27;t love this damn thing so much I&#x27;d pass. This is the best price I&#x27;ve found for true Oral-B and the knock offs don&#x27;t seem to be the kind of thing I want in my mouth.</li>
    <li> good product, but like printer toner cartridges, over priced</li>
    <li> we used all the time and amazon give us the best price</li>
    <li> Perfect and a great price</li>
    <li> I was a little worried since some reviews said they were knockoffs.  They must have resolved that issue because these seemed as genuine as any I ever bought (including ones that came with the toothbrush originally).  I tried to scratch the logo off just to be sure and it was fine. I thought I was getting a GREAT deal and then I went to Costco and their price per brush head was comparable.  So if you are worried, you can try costco, but I was very happy with these.</li>
    <li> Hard to find but worth the search.</li>
    <li> Very good product&lt;br /&gt;I like it so much&lt;br /&gt;The teeth used cleanliness high&lt;br /&gt;Let my mouth cleaner</li>
    <li> Normally, I buy the Target&#x27;s knockoff Up-and-Up brand. These out-perform the Target brand dramatically.</li>
    <li> Arrived as expected. They work well and fit my professional series brush.</li>
    <li> Have been using for years. Great price.</li>
    <li> Works well and really cleans teeth. Good value.</li>
    <li> My teeth don&#x27;t feel clean unless I use these heads - they massage and clean my gums while they clean my teeth.  Worth the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> As far as I can tell, a brush is a brush. These heads works just as well as other heads they sell.  I get the cheaper ones at the moment and stock up so I don&#x27;t need to worry about it for a long time.</li>
    <li> I love my Oral-b. it&#x27;s like going to a dentist every time I brush. The five pack was the better deal. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> Hard to find in the store but easy to order here.... fit my toothbrush just fine and now I&#x27;m stocked up for a while.</li>
    <li> Good price and good quality products. We love it!</li>
    <li> I had bought the less expensive, off brand a few times, and they seemed to not last at all. These are great and have lasted for awhile. Will def spend a little bit more so that I can have a better quality product.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really like the brush at all.</li>
    <li> they work like they say they should</li>
    <li> Necesary and best pack!</li>
    <li> Great brush, my hygienist said to keep up the good work.  It is a Breat Grush!  Opps, got so excited about it!  Really, I like it lots.</li>
    <li> I have ordered these in the past and as usual I got what I expected and arrival was timely.  Have not used yet as I always purchase before running out of the last one in use.  No problem whatsoever.</li>
    <li> Best price on the market no doubt. Great brushes for a great toothbrush! Quick service also, totally recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let the size fool you, it does a great job! Actually its small size makes it lighter hence more spin power.</li>
    <li> Oral- B is the best!!!</li>
    <li> very good,I buy it from amazonUS. to China</li>
    <li> Big family so more than one or two brush heads in a package is a great find.  The price was good.  Best part was not having to leave my home to go and buy them.</li>
    <li> A little bit expensive</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and as expected.  I like this product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t listen to my dental hygienist before now.  I love this thing - feel like I just left the dentist and had my teeth cleaned after every brushing.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the quality of the brushes; functions well.  There are similar replacement brushes made by other companies that are less expensive, but they can&#x27;t compare with the quality of these Oral-B brushes.</li>
    <li> Sorry, these did not fit my toothbrush handle.</li>
    <li> These are the cheapest replacements I have found that are actualy decent.  I have ordered these twice now with no problems.</li>
    <li> Replacement brush heads for an Oral-B bought several years ago - also at Amazon.  Routine resupply purchase for a product line that I like.</li>
    <li> I love these brush heads the most out of the oral-b line! I currently have braces and the floss action heads are perfect for getting in between the brackets.</li>
    <li> Great but always pricey</li>
    <li> I prefer the standard brush heads for daily use. The floss action heads would seem to be best used for gum massage.</li>
    <li> These appear to be authentic Oral-B/Braun replacement heads. Love them, and price is much better than in stores.  Love this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> super fast , like it very much</li>
    <li> I love these.  I think they really clean my teeth and make them look much whiter.  My husband and I both use these and I think they are far superior to the plain Oral-B brush heads without the floss action.  Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Great replacement brush head ,,, highly recommended</li>
    <li> my teeth have never felt cleaner!</li>
    <li> The best replacement for your oral-B floss brush, It is very efficient with the plaque.</li>
    <li> Good price for replacement brushes.</li>
    <li> Fits with my toothbrush as expected. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Purchased these at my local pharmacy. I guess some people like them but personally I think they&#x27;re awful. They are way too rough on my teeth and gums. Very disappointed in oral-B because the design seems more gimmick-based than an actual effort to make something that works. Apparently toothbrush designers think toothbrushes are supposed to look like sneakers these days.  The yellow &amp;#34;paddles&amp;#34; are completely inappropriate for the purpose intended. Anything that&#x27;s supposed to slip below the gum line or in between teeth needs to be thin and flexible not thick and stiff. It&#x27;s just poor design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest problem with oral-B electric heads has always been that the bristles don&#x27;t easily separate to get under the gum line. I always prefer when my brushes get slightly worn out because I can then use the edges for that purpose. What oral-B needs to do is make a toothbrush head with fewer or shorter bristles on the inside/ longer or more flexible bristles on the outside. And all their toothbrushes should be adjustable speed - when you&#x27;re trying to reach under the gum line, you don&#x27;t need your toothbrush grinding away at the flat of your tooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, can&#x27;t recommend these. I just purchased some of the sensitive brush heads so I will try those.</li>
    <li> Got exactly what I wanted within a reasonable amount of time.</li>
    <li> Product as listed.  Prompt shipping</li>
    <li> The Oral-B Professional Floss Action Replacement Brush Heads came in a timely matter and were what I thought I was ordering.</li>
    <li> I use this with my Oral-B Precision Black 7000. And all I can say is... OUCH!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think i&#x27;m the type of person who aggressively brushes my teeth. But during my first use, it left me with a huge cut on my gums. It was around an inch long cut that i&#x27;m guessing was caused by the huge rubber-like dangling thing. Took a few days and a lot of salt gargles to fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never again am I gonna use this nor would I recommend it to anyone. It&#x27;s just really harsh. Some people are saying that it cleans  better than all the other brush heads, but i&#x27;d rather not try again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the sensitive replacement brush and i&#x27;ll be sticking to that.</li>
    <li> as good as in BJs but for 35 % cheaper</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. They (along with the water pic) have helped me turn around my mouth health and fight periodontal issues which popped up after pregnancy.</li>
    <li> This is good value as a 5-pack and works very well for me.  The brushes enable me to reach my back teeth although the floss action effect isn&#x27;t that very evident to me but otherwise this is now my brand of choice for replacement brushes.  I replace the brush every 3 months but do they last longer if necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
    <li> These hold up better than the cheaper Chinese knock offs.</li>
    <li> Your teeth need to be really clean food particle cause a lot of damage and this works really well. 75 and still have all my teeth!</li>
    <li> These brush are just the right size to clean the teeth while gently touching the gumlines.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend them especially to folks with diabetes.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush, works well and they last long</li>
    <li> these are great at cleaning your gum lines and between your teeth, you may think that because the head is so small and it cant hold much toothpaste that your teeth wont be clean, you have to try this, your mouth will feel cleaner after the first use. the 5 pack was the best price and cheaper than at my local stores so, why not? its not like you arent going to need to buy more some day. This will last you a year.</li>
    <li> Item exactly as described and delivered quicker than expected.</li>
    <li> What can I say, these clean great with the floss action.</li>
    <li> I live in Texas where brushing the teeth is not so popular.  It is wonderful to be able to obtain a top shelf product at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> it is very good.i like it and will buy angai.</li>
    <li> I like the way it does a little better getting between teeth, but the brush head really is just a little large.  It is difficult to navigate around corners or around the back teeth.  It&#x27;s so wide that it ends up irritating my guns and adding sensitivity to my teeth.  Great idea, but Oral B needs to reduce the size of the head.  Going back to the original for now.</li>
    <li> Glad we always use oral b replacement brush and not some other generic ones. It&#x27;s a good deal for this 6pc and shipping is very fast.</li>
    <li> I resent how expensive the brushes are (ie, dont get this system thinking you&#x27;ll somehow have it net out over time compared to regular brushing) but dang this works well. It takes any guessing out of brushing. My dental appoints the last several years of owning this have consisted of &amp;#34;well, your teeth are perfect.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Wal-Mart stopped carrying these. I tried the Chinese version. 6 of the latter did not last as long as one of the former.</li>
    <li> great price and quick delivery</li>
    <li> Terrific hope no more cavities !</li>
    <li> Good pricing for Oral B replacement brushes.</li>
    <li> The real thing, came promptly.</li>
    <li> I got these instead of the regular heads and these work really well, although I would still recommend flossing lol. They shipped to me fast.</li>
    <li> Bought these to go with our new power brush set.  On my last visit (about 2 months after starting using them), my dental hygienist commented that she noticed less plaque build than normal.  She asked if I had switched brushes and I told her we were now using the Oral-B Floss Action.</li>
    <li> I love this product for two reasons.  One, it really works excellent; and two, the price on amazon is better than any other place I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
    <li> these are good brush heads...they should be for the price.  they are cheaper than buying at walmart though.  i am happy.</li>
    <li> These brushes are excellent.&lt;br /&gt;Great efficiency in cleaning, long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason why I rate them 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because, as occurs with other models, they tend to get dirty in the inside quite fast and they need an extra cleaning with any liquid soap or something. It&#x27;s a design problem that should be taken in account by ORAL B for future models. Otherwise they do their job very well.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what the problem is but I&#x27;m not buying Braun products again if they don&#x27;t address this - this is the second time I&#x27;ve bought brush heads in volume that fall off when they&#x27;re supposed to match the model.  It&#x27;s either&lt;br /&gt;1. poor quality control&lt;br /&gt;2. poor communication by Braun in saying what models they fit&lt;br /&gt;3. another fake - I tried the scratch test people have described and it doesn&#x27;t appear to be a fake&lt;br /&gt;Bar code is 0 69055 12439 0&lt;br /&gt;I reported the problem on braun&#x27;s web site but they&#x27;re not responsive</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with purchase. It fits motor end and brush provides good tooth cleaning action. Have owned Braun power&lt;br /&gt;power tooth brush 12 years, and did want to purchase a new own.</li>
    <li> My periodontist recommended these brushes many years ago when my gums were in bad shape.  Swollen as well as some bleeding while brushing.  After treatment from him and use of these brushes I had healthy gums in just a few months!  Don&#x27;t want to be without these brushes.</li>
    <li> These are the best. When I need to order again it will be these. The brushes do a wonderful job on your gums and teeth and can get to places other bristles can&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Since using these brush heads, I&#x27;ve been receiving an &amp;#34;EXCELLENT&amp;#34; rating on my oral health from my hygienist. Cleanings at the dentist&#x27;s are now a breeze as these brush heads leave my teeth nearly plaque free and my gums in great condition. I will continue to use these brush heads and have recommended them to friends and family.</li>
    <li> Oral-B has managed to increase the quality on an already great product. I&#x27;m glad they offer a 5 count package.</li>
    <li> Nice refills, fit properly, real deal.</li>
    <li> everything was as posted</li>
    <li> They fit and work as expected, I have not received any knock offs during any of my purchases of this product.</li>
    <li> I like Precision Clean better</li>
    <li> Are happy to buy at the best price.</li>
    <li> This one of the best Oral B Brush heads available. Tried some and this one does really a good job.</li>
    <li> Cannot use this kind of brush every day. Brush is too hard.</li>
    <li> been very happy with how these work and my dentist is happy with how my teeth and gums look at cleaning time.  makes the little expense very much worthwhile.</li>
    <li> Satisfied with my tooth brush heads. It gives me the clean feeling that i get after a cleaning at the dentist. Another effect is that it helps keep my teeth white without using whitening toothpaste. I have purchase these brushes many times. Still happy with them.</li>
    <li> I had used them before. They are the best</li>
    <li> Decent price and good brand name product.  I just couldn&#x27;t bring myself to buy the non-brand name replacements at half the cost due to worries about chemicals.</li>
    <li> I have been using these for 7 years and have been to many different dentists, and each one is always amazed that I don&#x27;t have any plaque.  One dentist even told me that I only need to come in once a year.  I even had 3 years between dentist appointments at one point, and my new dentist could not find any plaque or cavities.  If you brush for 2 minutes every day with these toothbrushes (follow the timer), you&#x27;re set.  I&#x27;d still recommend going to the dentist every six months though.  I was just moving a lot over that time period.</li>
    <li> This brush head cleans my teeth and mouth thoroughly.  I&#x27;ve never had a cavity ever since I started using an electric toothbrush, on the advice of my dentist, ten years ago, and this brush head, more than the others, cleans the best.  And the price on amazon is very reasonable.</li>
    <li> Great for flossing. Let this brush do Its &#x27;thing&#x27; by letting it do the work.</li>
    <li> Excellent product as described</li>
    <li> As described replacements</li>
    <li> Tried all the variations, these offer the best clean... the others may last a bit longer, but these are the best.</li>
    <li> Loved these for years, large size package nice!!</li>
    <li> oral-B products are always the best!!!</li>
    <li> Fits the appliance well and does a great job cleaning my teeth.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s good，i  hope more products can ship China</li>
    <li> These really seem to do a great job cleaning.  The floss action seems to work well and makes your teeth feel like you&#x27;ve just left the dentist.</li>
    <li> good for healthy teeth &amp; oral</li>
    <li> Removes exposed particles but regular flossing is required to remove particles between closely positioned teeth.</li>
    <li> Love these feel like I just went to the dentist every time I brush my teeth</li>
    <li> Nothing much to be said except the replacement heads were less expensive than the local WalMart who had none in stock.  I&#x27;m so tired of driving around looking for stuff that isn&#x27;t on the shelves.  The product itself is very high quality and works as advertised.</li>
    <li> I could not find these for less at any other store. Not even when they were on sale  at the major retail stores.</li>
