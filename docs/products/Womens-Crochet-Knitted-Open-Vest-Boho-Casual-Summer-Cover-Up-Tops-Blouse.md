      <li>My daughter loves this lace top.  </li>
      <li>but i still really love it.</li>
      <li>Really cute, fits well.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Such a great buy for lovely quality.  </li>
      <li>I first ordered one for myself and loved it so much I ordered two more for my friends.  </li>
      <li>I love it, my friends love it, my new favorite piece.</li>
      <li>SO hopefully that helps you get an idea of whether or not this will fit you.  </li>
      <li>I hope to find someone who will wear and enjoy this item.</li>
      <li>but I can fit into smalls too just don’t like them.  </li>
      <li>Good fit, nice color, has a little stretch.  </li>
      <li>I really want to like it, because the lace pattern is truly lovely.</li>
      <li>super value</li>
      <li>This is a very flimsy and cheap item.</li>
      <li>right way&amp;#34</li>
      <li>Love this little thing, very cute to throw over a tank or tshirt to make your outfit ten times cuter, true to size, would purchase from them again!</li>
      <li>The side should have been cute a little more evenly though.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not expensive--</li>
      <li>This is just what I wanted, an Ivory color and pretty lace.</li>
      <li>For those with a more voluptuous figure it&#x27;s just going to cover your back and arms.</li>
      <li>For more petite ladies, this might actually close in front.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really pretty for the price.</li>
      <li>First: this was ordered by accident.</li>
      <li>all, I do love the cardigan--I just wish I&#x27;d ordered my regular size.</li>
      <li>(it is sold as &amp;#34;one size fits all&amp;#34;).  </li>
      <li>I really recommend!</li>
      <li>I thought it was going to be too small because of some other reviews, but it fits perfectly, is lovely, and i have gotten so many compliments on it! :)</li>
      <li>We bought several other styles in this beautiful lace.</li>
      <li>there was a hole in the seam under the arm that was more than an inch long.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t wear it on a really hot day because it will probably itch, but I was comfortable in it outside on a day that was about 86-89F.</li>
      <li>The lace pattern is totally different and the material is cheap.</li>
      <li>Also, there&#x27;s a really pervasive chemical smell--I&#x27;ve washed this vest three times, and it still smells like a plastic factory.</li>
      <li>so if your complaing to much what do you expect ...</li>
      <li>I paid next to nothing for this piece, so I really didn&#x27;t expect much; I was pleasantly surprised by the quality--everything is sewn straight, and while it is definitely synthetic lace, it has a pretty nice feel to it.</li>
      <li>The fabric isn&#x27;t so good but for the prince that I got it&#x27;s fine!&lt;br /&gt;You can use with dresses, shirt, shorts and cropped, I mean, you can have a lot of combinations to use with this one.</li>
      <li>A lot of the reviews said this fit very small, but I found it pretty true to size.</li>
      <li>Under one of the armpits mine ripped, but its most likely due to wear and tear since I wear it so much!</li>
      <li>DID NOT LIKE ORDERED A EXTRA LARGE</li>
      <li>I was expecting a weird smell like a few people mentioned, but mine did not have it, which I was very happy about.</li>
      <li>It might work for a 10 year old.</li>
      <li>It fits well, slightly tight arms, so be aware!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cute but very delicate.</li>
      <li>But a lack of communication and ignorance about basic business practices made my attempts at a refund even more frustrating.</li>
      <li>As pretty as it is, but does not fit well on the shoulders...</li>
      <li>Some extra threads hanging loose, but easily fixed.</li>
      <li>Very well made, a little oversized</li>
</ol>

<li> Far worse, when I requested a refund I got a slew of emails telling me it wouldn&#x27;t be worth returning the item and threatening not to refund my money</li>
<li> Not super high quality, but</li>
<li> This garment is not only feminine style, it is lovely over a casual sleeveless dress, or other spring/summer apparel.</li>
<li> The arm holes hang about 4 inches below my armpits, and the back is so wide that it slips off my shoulders regularly.</li>
<li> I wanted it to be loose, but it is WAY too big.</li>
<li> The length is decent and goes just past my butt.</li>
<li> I love this knitted crochet open vest for its boho casual style!</li>
<li> Be careful with this since it seems like fragile material</li>
<li> The size is bigger than expected.</li>
<li> To give you an idea of my size im 5&amp;#34;5 (with long arms) 34C and</li>
<li> cause it keeps slipping off.</li>
<li> Has a patch where they used pink thread.</li>
<li> I usually wear a small (sometimes and extra small), but ordered the large based on the reviews.</li>
<li> It is designed to be loose, but very slightly fitted--the waist goes in just a bit to give it a feminine form--so you don&#x27;t need to order up a size or two to get the loose &amp;#34;flowy&amp;#34;</li>
<li> ..wish they had multiple collars...runs small.</li>
<li> I havent&#x27; in a very long time smelled something so foul!!!.  </li>
<li> Also needed to tack down some of the lace along the shoulders</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Fits weird, cant find anything to wear with it...but it&#x27;s so cute</li>
    <li> Very well made, a little oversized but I like that, and it&#x27;s beautiful. I got many compliments on it :)</li>
    <li> Nice cover up.  Runs small</li>
    <li> The size is bigger than expected. It is just like the pic, but since it is too big it fits awkward and the sleeves keeps falling off.</li>
    <li> This is just what I wanted, an Ivory color and pretty lace. It fits well, slightly tight arms, so be aware! I plan on wearing it with sleeveless tanks and dresses so it works perfectly for that. Some extra threads hanging loose, but easily fixed. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> too small gave to my daughter..she loved it.</li>
    <li> good quality, shipped within a week. It&#x27;s really pretty for the price.</li>
    <li> I love it, my friends love it, my new favorite piece.</li>
    <li> As shown. Correct size. Very nice</li>
    <li> poor quality- poor fit. there was a hole in the seam under the arm that was more than an inch long.</li>
    <li> In love for this one! The fabric isn&#x27;t so good but for the prince that I got it&#x27;s fine!&lt;br /&gt;You can use with dresses, shirt, shorts and cropped, I mean, you can have a lot of combinations to use with this one. I really recommend!</li>
    <li> Just beautiful I love it</li>
    <li> Too small. Front was way too skimpy and didn&#x27;t close in the front. It might work for a 10 year old.</li>
    <li> Really cute, fits well. The side should have been cute a little more evenly though. Delicate material so only hand wash.</li>
    <li> For more petite ladies, this might actually close in front. For those with a more voluptuous figure it&#x27;s just going to cover your back and arms. Also, there&#x27;s a really pervasive chemical smell--I&#x27;ve washed this vest three times, and it still smells like a plastic factory. I really want to like it, because the lace pattern is truly lovely. Good thing it&#x27;s not expensive--I&#x27;ll see how many times it takes to wash out the smell.</li>
    <li> First: this was ordered by accident. When clicking to see an enlarged picture, the item was ordered and cancelling was not successful. When trying to return it the cost was prohibitive. I am taking a lesson from this and I am not going to look at merchandise or order from my Kindle ever again. I hope to find someone who will wear and enjoy this item. Good luck with your business.</li>
    <li> Shipping took 1 1/2 weeks to get to me, this is def not crochet.. but you can tell in the picture its lace, but I like the lace, not your everyday pattern lace that you see around ...... the only issue was it had pieces of thread flying out but a simple cut will fix and it was only $8 so if your complaing to much what do you expect ...</li>
    <li> Happy with it for the price</li>
    <li> Very beautiful and comfy it fit perfect and I would definitely buy again. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;4 157 lbs and got in in U.S. size</li>
    <li> I love it. Very comfortable. But took forever to receive.</li>
    <li> very pretty, but very small.</li>
    <li> DID NOT LIKE ORDERED A EXTRA LARGE iTS WAY TOO SMALL</li>
    <li> This is beautiful...everybody asks where I got it..wish they had multiple collars...runs small.</li>
    <li> As pretty as it is, but does not fit well on the shoulders...may be they are narrow...cause it keeps slipping off.</li>
    <li> A lot of the reviews said this fit very small, but I found it pretty true to size. I am 5 feet 2 inches tall and weigh about 105 pounds. I usually wear a small (sometimes and extra small), but ordered the large based on the reviews. I wanted it to be loose, but it is WAY too big. The arm holes hang about 4 inches below my armpits, and the back is so wide that it slips off my shoulders regularly. The bottom falls about mid hip, which is about where I wanted it. It is designed to be loose, but very slightly fitted--the waist goes in just a bit to give it a feminine form--so you don&#x27;t need to order up a size or two to get the loose &amp;#34;flowy&amp;#34; look.&lt;br /&gt;Over all, I do love the cardigan--I just wish I&#x27;d ordered my regular size. The quality is great for the price. I paid next to nothing for this piece, so I really didn&#x27;t expect much; I was pleasantly surprised by the quality--everything is sewn straight, and while it is definitely synthetic lace, it has a pretty nice feel to it. I wouldn&#x27;t wear it on a really hot day because it will probably itch, but I was comfortable in it outside on a day that was about 86-89F.</li>
    <li> Adorable! Love this little thing, very cute to throw over a tank or tshirt to make your outfit ten times cuter, true to size, would purchase from them again!</li>
    <li> Beautiful but one size fits all doesn&#x60;t fit all.  Small for someone who wears size  10-12.  Also needed to tack down some of the lace along the shoulders</li>
    <li> great all around.  super value</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS. DO NOT DEAL WITH THIS COMPANY. The item shipped to me bears does not match the photo. The vest is quite short, way above the hips. The lace pattern is totally different and the material is cheap. Far worse, when I requested a refund I got a slew of emails telling me it wouldn&#x27;t be worth returning the item and threatening not to refund my money so I might as well keep it. Then no emails at all and no possibility of return or refund. The person writing the emails does not seem to understand English. Nothing wrong with that; we all can&#x27;t be born in English speaking countries. But a lack of communication and ignorance about basic business practices made my attempts at a refund even more frustrating.</li>
    <li> item received and looked very nice.  did not even put it close to my body as it STUNK.  I mean STUNK.  I havent&#x27; in a very long time smelled something so foul!!!.  I immediately went to the trash can in the garage and threw it away.  it was horrible!!</li>
    <li> It is not crochet, it is longer on one side and besides it is very small  (it is sold as &amp;#34;one size fits all&amp;#34;).  Completelly disappointed.</li>
    <li> Has a patch where they used pink thread. It looks like a stain.</li>
    <li> I got this jacket to go with the lace floral sleeveless crochet knit vintage womens vest tank top and it is a perfect match in color and lace patter.  Looks list a really expensive set.  Good fit, nice color, has a little stretch.  There were several hanging strings but not a problem to clip off.  Just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Very small. Not what I thought it would be. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this lace top.  She is experimenting with wearing it backwards with a belt or ribbon at the waist and crossing it in the back.  It looks lovely &amp;#34;the right way&amp;#34; too. Such a great buy for lovely quality.  We bought several other styles in this beautiful lace.</li>
    <li> Not super high quality, but every time I wear it, people ask where I got it. I love it.</li>
    <li> i bought this product with great expectation. it was not as good as the picture shows even though it would serve the purpose for which it was bought&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like the quality, the colour is ok .</li>
    <li> I first ordered one for myself and loved it so much I ordered two more for my friends.  The quality and value were awesome!</li>
    <li> Not very good quality workmanship.</li>
    <li> I looooooovveee it!!! It fits perfectly! To give you an idea of my size im 5&amp;#34;5 (with long arms) 34C and usually a size medium ( i don&#x27;t like tight clothing) but I can fit into smalls too just don’t like them.  SO hopefully that helps you get an idea of whether or not this will fit you.  Im in love! Shipping was about two weeks FYI</li>
    <li> I love this knitted crochet open vest for its boho casual style! This garment is not only feminine style, it is lovely over a casual sleeveless dress, or other spring/summer apparel. This vest is flattering to all types of feminine figures.</li>
    <li> I thought it was going to be too small because of some other reviews, but it fits perfectly, is lovely, and i have gotten so many compliments on it! :)</li>
    <li> This is a very flimsy and cheap item. I am requesting to send it back. It reminds me of a polyester doilie from the 70&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!!!! It is perfect.</li>
    <li> Its beautiful! I&#x27;m happy with my purchase. I was expecting a weird smell like a few people mentioned, but mine did not have it, which I was very happy about. It&#x27;s cute but very delicate. The length is decent and goes just past my butt. Be careful with this since it seems like fragile material but i still really love it.</li>
    <li> I have had this since April of last year and I still wear it often! It is flowy, comfortable, not itchy, and a beautiful color. Under one of the armpits mine ripped, but its most likely due to wear and tear since I wear it so much! Other than that, it is not easily rippable and I am considering buying it in black as well because of all the compliments I receive when wearing this shirt!</li>
