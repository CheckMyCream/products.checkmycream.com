<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product was a commission for a friend so I do not have much to add.</li>
    <li> Fake fake fake fake!!!! Do not buy this Cologne for a gift because dad, husband, brother, uncle , boyfriend will be disappointed.  Scent is like every other imitation fragrances. Save your money guys and gals.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s fake since it&#x27;s my first bottle, but the fragrance doesn&#x27;t last! Definitely would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Love this cologne and seems to be the real stuff :)</li>
    <li> I know it&#x27;s mostly dependent on a person&#x27;s body chemistry, and while this EDT smells great, it doesn&#x27;t seem to last more than 2-3 hours on my skin.  That&#x27;s made worse by the fact that this scent is light in nature to begin with.  Again, it smells good, a light, breezy, slightly sweet smell, but with so many to choose from, I&#x27;ll definitely go for one that lasts longer for me.</li>
    <li> D &amp; G Light Blue for men has excellent quality as expected. I like to wear it going out either during the day or at night. I would have liked it better if it lasted longer - the fragrance would become very faint to nearly gone in 5-6 hours.</li>
    <li> Gift for my husband.  He loved it and uses it frequently.</li>
    <li> This cologne smells really nice. I bought a 2.5 oz at a tax-free shop for $44. I really don&#x27;t know why other reviewers think the smell doesn&#x27;t stay on for very long - I haven&#x27;t noticed this. The scent from this cologne lingers intermittently for hours after use and it&#x27;s very light and not overbearing like some other brands.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my special guy and he loved it. It has a very clean fragrance and it is not overpowering. This was a great buy.</li>
    <li> came in an excellent condition.</li>
    <li> Very nice, clean, sexy scent. This scent is very light and not overpowering at all, my husband loves it and so I. Good buy</li>
    <li> Dolce and Gabanna Light Blue smells really great if you&#x27;re looking for a clean scent that is not overbearing. The scent is a light, fresh and cooling smell that instantly becomes a favorite. I would give this 5 stars if not for the longevity and projection Lasts about 3-4 hours on my body, but depends on certain factors such as individuals. The smell is not too strong so i&#x27;d recommend at least 2 spritz. Lastly, i found that this  does not have such a strong projection as compared to other floral scents such as aqua de gio. Still a great cologne for men, I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> One of my husbands favorite smells.</li>
    <li> This is a shame! I hope Amazon will take care of this issue ASP. I have been using D&amp;C Light Blue for several years now and this is the first time that I buy it online. I didn&#x27;t open this product until last night, when I opened it, I immediately notice that the fragrance was not the same. I spray it and then confirmed it. You can only imagine how angry I was!!! I have I ready email Amazon. I expect for them to give me my money back!</li>
    <li> Nice, clean scent. You can use it for an evening out or every day use. Light in smell so its not overbearing</li>
    <li> What a fabulous scent...I fall in love all over again when my husband&#x27;s wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was fantastic, product was delivered in excellent condition, and the price was the best ever!  Thank you.</li>
    <li> This was a very good purchase for the price. it is not only has a lasting fragrance but its also subtle and sophisticated. i would recommend it to anyone as a gift purchase.</li>
    <li> this is my favorite scent for my husband.  amazon is about as inexpensive as you will find.  department stores are often more expensive.  the scent is very manly &amp; he always gets complimented when he wears it.</li>
    <li> Product is great.  Always get favorable comments when I wear.  Price was great due to black monday discounts.  Very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> I love the way this cologne smells!! I totally recommend it. I bought it for my fiance for christmas and he loves it too.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my last bottle of \\&quot;Light Blue\\&quot; which was running out. When I received the bottle I immediately noticed that the bottle top seemed cheaper than the original and the smell was weaker. I had a friend do a blind smell test by spraying both the new and old bottles on a pieces of cloth. The friend easily identified the original, old bottle as it 1) smelled better and 2) lasted much longer. The smell from the bottle I received from Amazon wore off after 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, since this product is a \\&quot;hazardous material\\&quot; it cannot be returned, so I feel like I just threw $50 away</li>
    <li> Dolce and Gabbana light blue is great for the spring and summer days.  I find it to work well in temperatures 80-88 degrees. I primarily use it when I am going to the store, hanging around the house or coming from the gym.  Good juice and something to look at if you are into the light spring/summer colognes.  Good for college students and up.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas present for my husband and we really like this cologne.  When I placed my order with Amazon, I requested this be sent as a gift and Amazon put the price on the invoice and they did not include my message to my husband.  I did not want him to see how much I spent on his gift and I was not very happy that the invoice with the price on it was in there and that the message I wrote to him was not included.  I logged onto Amazon.com just to make sure that I did send this as a gift and I did.&lt;br /&gt;******If you are sending this as a gift, Amazon may still include the price with the gift!!******</li>
    <li> Got this scent for a friend and it was a wonderful choice. Very fragrant. It&#x27;s light, but it&#x27;s very noticeable. A great D&amp;G scent and best for those under 30. (My friend is 21.)</li>
    <li> Great deal, husband loved it!!</li>
    <li> Dolce &amp; Gabbana Light Blue smells WONDERFUL!  I told my husband that I don&#x27;t think he should leave the house wearing it because he smells too good! Definitely worth trying!</li>
    <li> Shipment was fast. No problems with product. Suggest to others. I had used this product twice and liked it. This time bought for my brother as a gift, and it came pretty fast. Like it! thanks</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 16 yo. son. He is just starting to wear cologne and I wanted to get him something nice but not to over the top. This fit the bill. He enjoys the compliments he gets all the time wearing this.&lt;br /&gt;Now my husband wants it too, so I am back for another.</li>
    <li> This smells awesome. I loved how my husband smells in this. Very sexy. I got for him for Christmas and he liked it as much as I did.</li>
    <li> I remember smelling Light Blue somewhere before, and I liked it.  Finally a couple years later I decided to order some for myself.  When it arrived, it smells even better than I remember.  Definitely one of my favorite colognes that I have now.  My friend likes D&amp;G The One but personally I think Light Blue is better!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite colognes. It lasts for a good while. Its very light, doesn&#x27;t overwhelm you or others at all. It smells fantastic, I love it, the ladies love it. No complaints!</li>
    <li> Hi There Blog Fans!&lt;br /&gt;My first encounter with Dolce &amp; Gabbana Light Blue was not promising, since it sat on the store shelf with little or on spotlight. A buddy of mine recommended it with high regards, therefore I resolved to take a closer look at Light Blue and decode its command for attention from the ladies.&lt;br /&gt;Day one of light blue and my wife is feeling it hum... who knows how far this would go. \\&quot;Like a moth to a flame lol. Light blue already seems to be a morning and smooth evening ware, it is easy to wear, yet it has a sophisticated character, note that it is not strong and long lasting live Curves or Cool Water. This new addition is classed in my AQUA LIGHT Category and may make it to my Absolute Favorite list. I will update this blog next week.&lt;br /&gt;ENJOY!&lt;br /&gt;Rambo Rapu&lt;br /&gt;Rapu Family and Friends Network</li>
    <li> Excellent aroma. Good price for the size of the bottle. Made a wonderful Christmas present. Loved giving this as a gift.</li>
    <li> This will always be a classic cologne for all ages and characters. Short and sweet: You can never go wrong, the only cologne that is a guaranteed excellent gift.</li>
    <li> I love this cologne, great smelling stuff, always getting compliments from the ladies who tell me how good I smell all the time.&lt;br /&gt;As long as this scent stays how it is, and D &amp; G don&#x27;t try and \\&quot;improve\\&quot; the smell. I will continue to get this stuff every time my&lt;br /&gt;bottle hits empty. Love it.</li>
    <li> This was a present for my son, his request. Really liked the scent. light and clean. would recommend this product</li>
    <li> I gave this to my son for Christmas he loved it ! He drives around with it in his car</li>
    <li> Love the smell. Very refreshing and clean. The bottle was very well designed. I will recommend to my friends.  THANKS.</li>
    <li> Its fake! Bought this for hubby. The bottle looks totally different than the one sold at Macys! Also the scent is nice, but he has to spray 5 or 6 times for it to stay a little while. I wish I wouldn&#x27;t have been so cheap and just got the original. Good thing is, he doesn&#x27;t know the difference and he sprays a lot anyways.</li>
    <li> This is not legitimate! After I purchased it, I examined the box closely and can see where security features have been removed and phony barcode stickers have been added. I knew it was a good price, but after checking I found it&#x27;s about half the cost of the same cologne from legitimate online retailers like Macy&#x27;s and Nordstrom&#x27;s. The smell is close to original but not as strong or long lasting. Just know you are buying knockoff D&amp;G and not the real deal!!!</li>
    <li> i love this cologne, i like to spray it mostly during the summer because i can smell it better. fresh as water</li>
    <li> My boyfriend and son only wear this cologne...they LOVE the smell and so do I.....I give it more than five  stars :-)</li>
    <li> This is the only men&#x27;s cologne i can tolerate wearing, the smell is not over powerful  definately a good buy</li>
    <li> I love it. It&#x27;s was very nice and feels nice, it was fast and I would recommend it to everyone</li>
    <li> My husband really enjoyed this bottle.  I gave it to him for valentines day.  He really did enjoy the smell.  I enjoyed the price</li>
    <li> I really like this scent. My boyfriend uses it quite often. It is strong but subtle! This is a great value for the quantity you get as well.</li>
    <li> Smell great  for a great price!!!  Wonderful buy!!!  Love  Amazon Also!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased his cologne for my older brother he seems to like it very much he wears it everyday very good price ..its last about 8 hr</li>
    <li> I use this during the day at work and it is mild and not over powering. It doesn&#x27;t last the entire day, so it is good for work. I don&#x27;t want to be that guy that reeks of cologne all day long in the office if you know what I mean.</li>
    <li> I have nothing but complements on theis cologne.  I have quite a few different colonges and this is one of my favorite right now. nice subtile smell not tooo strong. i recommend D and G light blue</li>
    <li> I have been trying out different scents lately and this one is for keeps. Great scent, always makes me feel younger. Plus, the compliments I got from wearing this have been good as well.</li>
    <li> Great summer fragrance.</li>
    <li> great cologne! got to my house fairly quick. I highly reccomend this fragrance, very smooth. females always saying how nice I smell. haha</li>
    <li> This product is fake.  Contacting Amazon to have removed.</li>
    <li> My favorite cologne love it.</li>
    <li> I purchased Light Blue por Homme for myself after buying Light Blue for women for my wife.  She loved the scent on me.  Personally I find the scent to be pleasant, light - understated if you will.  So far I&#x27;ve received several compliments at work on it as well.  It has been a nice change from my typical Burberry scents that I normally wear.</li>
    <li> My nephew saw this in a magazine, opened the page sample, smelled it and was very impressed.  Told me, &amp;#34;Aunt Jay I want this for my early birthday present&amp;#34;.  It was April &amp; his birthday was in Feb. so that was a VERY EARLY birthday gift).  He wears it everyday &amp; tells me he gets so many compliments; I think he is going to be wearing D &amp; G Light Blue for a long time.  BTW, I came to Amazon to make my purchase because it was half the price of what it cost at a brick &amp; mortor store.  My nephew has since opened an account with Amazon Prime, so he can find great bargins like this.  This is why I am his &amp;#34;Favorite Aunt&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> This is a great cologne.</li>
    <li> Great gift for my husband, price was competitive and smells great</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what other people received when they ordered this,but mine was the real one,and I have no complaints. Would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t with this one, i just cant. The smell reminds me of my wifes make up case...Its a musky, citrus, flowery scent. It disturbs me, &amp; reminds me of an old lady. I wouldnt recommend anyone wear this.</li>
    <li> Great fragrance,my son loves it,and wants another one,i myself would recommend anyone to purchase,when you want to smell like a man should.</li>
    <li> Love it...It is certainly the real deal. The scent is so clean and fresh. Would recommend for sure! wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to order product again.</li>
    <li> This is the second bottle of this that I&#x27;ve bought for my husband. He loves the smell, and I do as well. Would highly recommend this cologne!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for his birthday, it&#x27;s his favorite cologne. It came early and in perfect condition. He loved it. :)</li>
    <li> Purchased  for my son, smells great.</li>
    <li> GRACIAS POR EL PRODUCTO ES EXACTAMENTE LO QUE COMPRE BUEN DIA EXCELENTE</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my  son, because I love how this smells.  He liked it very much. It has a very nice, light, fresh scent.</li>
    <li> More compliments, non requested. A very noticably awesome smell, which illicates comments by itself. The ladies love this guys!!! My wife has even asked I put it on occasion!!! Wife has never done that for any other cologne I  use, or have used. I use three different types of cologne. hanae Mori I use if I&#x27;m going to business meetings or meeting new people. Hugo Boss if I&#x27;m going to hang out with Friends. Nautica if I need to freshen up away from home (cover smell).</li>
    <li> Great, light smell.  Great deal versus the department store.</li>
    <li> Just had my bottle arrive, and I am so upset! I seen earlier comments people posted about being a fake ! it&#x27;s true, the bottle and everything is the same on outside. The smell is way off, I just had a test with a couple people and 100% of the tests were against this terrible product. What a waste of cash, this is a no good product!!!!</li>
    <li> i really like the sample i smelled in a magazine ad. but this didnt live up to my expectations.  the packaging is very nice and makes an impressive gift.. just try to find a sample at a store before you buy it.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve like the fragrance, and have received compliments on it, too.</li>
    <li> Great price for the size we purchased. My husband likes this cologne and I was able to get a good size bottle for a better price than I could find anywhere else by several dollars.</li>
    <li> I have a hard time with perfumy items.  My wife is always sniffing the samples in her magazines.  Where she might find something that smells good to her - most of the time it makes me want to sneeze.  That is until she shared this sample with me.  Its pleasant without being over powering.  Bonus - she really likes it</li>
    <li> Great scent, I use Dolce lt blue every day!&lt;br /&gt;This is a manly scent, for the working man!&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> Service was great product received on time will use this provider again actually got my order sooner than I expected would gladly recommend this to friends and family</li>
    <li> Its fake. If you have money to waste and like good smell that&#x27;s gone after one hour - go ahead and buy it.</li>
    <li> I like it alot. it is smooth. the smell doesnt stay on to long tho. I would recomend this product</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend.  It is not an overpowering scent.  It is fresh and clean smelling.  I really like it.</li>
    <li> Arrived in great time and in good condition.  To tell the truth, I thought it was for women when I ordered it, but still smells&lt;br /&gt;great, I just use very little.  Nice item</li>
    <li> The item is pricy, but other than that it was good.  Arrived in good condition.  This item was purchased as a gift.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not an expert on these things but it seems original. came in perfect condition, sealed, nice suede(ish) box. Really nice mild, fresh, crisp scent. fully satisfied.</li>
    <li> This is a great price on a wonderful smelling cologne. I bought it as a gift for my husband who was looking for a new cologne. Not knowing if he would like it as much as I did when I saw it in a store. He really loves it and he keeps getting compliments on it. I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> I have bought this cologne several times from Amazon and I love it.. my husband wears it and I bought it this time for my daughters boyfriend fir Christmas..</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband and love it on him!! We both like how it&#x27;s not overpowering, and light but still a clean, masculine scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll be honest- I won&#x27;t pretend to know what individual scents are part of Light Blue for Men.  But I purchased a bottle and really like the scent.  I&#x27;ve gotten compliments from various females as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I don&#x27;t like is that the scent is not strong, so you need to spray a few times if you want it to last.  Of course, people who don&#x27;t like a strong cologne may consider that a positive.</li>
    <li> My son&#x27;s favorite. One of his Christmas gifts.</li>
    <li> A Christmas gift that arrived on time and the recipient seemed quite pleased.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my boyfriend and we both really like the scent.  It was a great deal, too!  This size bottle sells for around $65 at department stores, so I was quite pleased to find such a good price.</li>
    <li> fast and great smell...</li>
    <li> Its a perfect eau de toilette for daily use.</li>
    <li> It does not smell that good to me.&lt;br /&gt;I had read reviews that recommended it, but I was very disappointed by smell.</li>
    <li> I was weary about it since some reviews stating &amp;#34;its not the same as the ones on the stores&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;it doesn&#x27;t last as long&amp;#34;....must agree first couple sprays (3 to 5) smelled a bit different but after that product smelled exactly like the one I bought at my local store, I still had a couple sprays of the other one and compared and I must say I am very satisfied and I got to save money.  Will buy again...Great smell, I get compliments from both females and males...</li>
    <li> I, like an earlier reviewer, received the spray in a fake box.  The original bar code was cut out and covered with a fake bar code.  Also, the glue on the box failed when I took out the spray, but the scent is very strong and lasts all day, so not sure what product I received, I would have to compare it to the spray at the mall. Very skeptical of this.  This was shipped from and sold by Amazon.com. and not a 3rd party seller.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this cologne, it is a little similar to Versace for me, they both have a nice clean scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is an older version or what, but I got this for my girlfriend and it doesn&#x27;t smell like what is being sold in Sephora. I will say that the smell is still good, but not what I was expecting. This has a more spicy and woody smell, while still being a women&#x27;s perfume.</li>
    <li> Great price and a great cologne.  I had lost my old bottle.  I then ordered this.  Two days after it arived I found the other bottle.  Oh well, I like it so much Im keeping it.</li>
    <li> This Is an Excellent smelling fragrance!&lt;br /&gt;I have many different Colognes, but this one is in my top 3!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my man and he loves it!!!!! Great gift!!! Will be looing for some more D&amp;G to purchase!!! Thanks</li>
    <li> I pride myself more on how I smell than what I wear.  Yes, the two should go hand in hand, but I&#x27;m a 42+  year old man trying to remember that I am not 25 anymore so I have to dress accordingly.  So while I figure that whole thing out, with my changing body type and all, you can&#x27;t EVER go wrong by smelling nice. And this stuff is the ticket.  You can skimp on SOME things, but you cant skimp on cologne.  Get some of this - definitely in my top 5.....a great addition to my &amp;#34;smell good&amp;#34; arsenal!</li>
    <li> This is the real deal, smells great and get compliments on it all the time. It REALLY last a long time. I can spray some on at 6 amand still smell it on me the next day before I shower. You do get what you pay for and  Dolce &amp; Gabbana is so worth the extra money</li>
    <li> I love this cologne too... I am not really a colgne freak, reallly....  I just like a light citrix/fruity/spicy hint.... This has it too!  I have enough colognes now that I won&#x27;t have to buy any for years!  LOL</li>
    <li> D&amp;G Light Blue is my favorite scent any time of the year, not too strong or musky, very light and simple - great price</li>
    <li> Smells amazing. I love for my hubby to wear it.</li>
    <li> this product is very good, reliable and fast seller always use and has given me good result ...... ........ recommend you can use it without problems ........ i like thanks a lot ..........</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my boyfriend for Christmas. It came on time and was a perfect gift for him</li>
    <li> Describing a fragrance is very difficult so I will not try. I will say this cologne is fresh and clean but not overbearing. I smelled several kinds at a local store and chose this as my favorite. My wife recently purchased this for me as a birthday gift. I really like the smell, the size of the bottle, and how long it lasts! I spray directly on my skin and it lasts for hours!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Clean and Fresh Masculine Scent&lt;br /&gt;+ Subtle Yet Bold&lt;br /&gt;+ Lasts Several Hours&lt;br /&gt;+ Nice Size Bottle is Great For Travel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;_Bottom Line_ Yes, I would recommend this to a friend. Many colognes smell great but do not last. Two small sprays from this bottle and you&#x27;ll be smelling great for a couple hours. Highly Recommend it!</li>
    <li> Love this cologne .I wear it all the time and my wife Likes when I wear it to.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery! Great Item! Item just as described!</li>
    <li> Smells great on my boyfriend and he loves it!!</li>
    <li> The ladies love this cologne no matter where I go I get complements</li>
    <li> The best perfume I&#x27;ve ever purchased. Perfect one for my husband to wear it any time of the day!</li>
    <li> I love this cologne. I love the smell.</li>
    <li> He absouletly loved the D&amp;G light blue.. by far the best suprise for my special someone!! It came very quickly!</li>
    <li> This is a gift for my son, it smells wonderful. Something he asked for, had bought the same cologne last year.</li>
