      <li>I&#x27;ve heard of people making their own spray</li>

      <li>I was complimented on the smell and asked what kind of &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34; I was wearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It was too watery and it didn&#x27;t smell as nice.</li>
      <li>I think it provides nice body without getting crunchy</li>

      <li>The smell was nice and easy to use, but it didn&#x27;t add any additional texture to my hair.  </li>
      <li>or I can spray it in and use my blow dryer&#x27;s diffuser to give me a more voluminous, sexy look.</li>
      <li>More Inside.</li>
      <li>The spray also has a nice light fragrance.  </li>
      <li>My wife love this for her hair.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I think I love the scent more than anything.</li>
      <li>I am glad I bought it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product (purchased from a reputable online retailer) for about 6 months.</li>
      <li>It really is magic for my hair.</li>
      <li>and I love the smell.</li>
      <li>I am able to get the curl definition I am looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Gives my wavy hair a bit more of a defined curls look.</li>
      <li>I used to love another brand of sea salt texturizing spray but they haven&#x27;t made that in years.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>It does make my hair look better</li>
      <li>By the way absolutely love birch box.</li>
      <li>My favorite sea salt spray is Davines</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I love this spray.  </li>
      <li>I love the texture it gives my hair.</li>
      <li>it is okay.</li>
      <li>for my wavy, semi-thick, medium length tresses, I have only achieved the perfect beach wave look once since owning this product.</li>
      <li>I love the smell as well</li>
      <li>It is definitely an interesting concept, and on my hair, it seem to work</li>
      <li>okay.  </li>
      <li>:) people notice you&#x27;re around</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many sea salt sprays since I discovered it, including Aquage and Not Your Mother&#x27;s, but nothing beats this one.</li>
      <li>Very nice texture and reasonable price.</li>
      <li>Wonderful fragrance and easy application makes this a must have for the days when you just need that different do.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to control my curls, but this this stuff makes it easy</li>
      <li>This acts more like a light hair spray than a texturizing spray.</li>
      <li>When it is dry, I spray my hair lightly again, and it is perfect!  </li>
      <li>I love that my hair smells good, is wavy, and still very soft and not at all sticky.</li>
      <li>This allows me to get easy waves with lots of texture.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so easy</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used a few sea salt sprays and this one has worked the best, even better than one that was 2x</li>
      <li>Terribly strong and overly perfumed.  </li>
      <li>I use a strong hair spray.</li>
      <li>The product I recieved immediately made my hair feel like straw upon applying it, and smelled like I&#x27;d sprayed strong perfume all over the place.</li>
      <li>My hair is wavy and fine</li>
      <li>I also suspect that it&#x27;s lighter and more successful for buyers with short hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good: The smell, the bottle (dispenses it in a fine mist)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad: It leaves a weird residue on my hair and I have much better results with other products that are less expensive and just as good.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It doesn&#x27;t quite &amp;#34;beach it up&amp;#34; but it makes my curly hair super curly with a bounce that nothing else I&#x27;ve found can mimic. Doesn&#x27;t feel crunch or salty like other sprays I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> does nothing, I have fine thin hair that&#x27;s wavy. I have used other sea sprays that have worked, I thought I would try this. It lessened the waves,  made it frizzy (which never happens) and left it flat.  waste of money. Wish I could return it.</li>
    <li> smells amazing and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it</li>
    <li> Gives Lift to the hair and not too sticky. I can&#x27;t find it at Walgreens anymore so I shopped at Amazon.</li>
    <li> This spray is nice if you don&#x27;t use more than about 5 sprays for medium to long hair. Use between 2 to 4 for short to medium. I have found on dry hair , it can make your hair sticky and straw like if you use too much. If you put it on dry, mist layers underneath and scrunch in. Then hold a foot or so away and finish hair. In damp hair mist a few sprays and comb through with a little leave in spray conditoner and then scrunch. Scrunch more as hair dries or use a blow dryer on low while scrunching. You can also use this as a root booster or spray in damp as a setting lotion. I personally like the bumble and bumble sea salt spray better; less sticky and more natural. I have double processes blond, dry hair. It is naturally straight and thick. This works well for making waves in my stick straight hair. I would buy again because the price is good for the quality and performance of the product.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this spray, it is perfect for casual hair days.</li>
    <li> Ahhh, I use Toni and Guy shampoo and conditioner and I REALLY wanted to like this...TBH, I think there are a few better Sea Salt Sprays and Texturizers...</li>
    <li> I got this product as a sample size in my Target Beauty box and it was the first salt spray that I&#x27;ve tried. It helps to create texture and keep my waves looking nice throughout the day, without causing my  hair to be stiff. It also has a great scent.</li>
    <li> Great product will be buying again.  Actually does what it says!</li>
    <li> Nice, light hold and smells absolutely amazing!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I love the smell; it makes me think of Gulf Shores and the other beaches along the Alabama/Florida coast. I love the texture it gives my hair. It&#x27;s way too expensive for what it is and it is totally a useless indulgence, but everytime I spray my hair I am glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> What a wonderful product! I received this Sea Salt Texturising Spray a few weeks ago, and I&#x27;ve been using it every day since. I have long, naturally curly hair and this product is perfect for me! On days that I don&#x27;t feel like scrunching and blow drying my hair with a diffuser, this sea salt spray really comes in handy. I just sprintz it on my damp hair, shake my head and I&#x27;m out the door. My hair dries naturally, but it don&#x27;t get frizzy. The result is a nice, loose, wavy curl... beachy hair, as I like to call it. I&#x27;m almost out of this bottle, but I&#x27;ll be buying a few bottles at a time from now on!</li>
    <li> Did not do anything to my fine hair. Had to return for refund :/</li>
    <li> My teenage granddaughter LOVES this product.  It does what it promises.</li>
    <li> After a few tries with this I was able to find a way to make some nice waves in my hair. I have thick hair and when it&#x27;s damp, I spray this evenly throughout and then run my fingers through it to make sure it&#x27;s pulled down from top to tips. Then I twist my hair around and tie it up with a few rubber bands.  Then I let it dry on it&#x27;s own, or use a blow dryer if I need it done a little faster. After this I undo the twists and my hair has soft waves and large curls in it without the need for a curling iron. I finish it off with a spritz of a flexible hold hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This spray helps my hair hold the curl and the style, where as without it, the weight and length of my thick hair usually pulls the waves right out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have fine hair or are styling your hair in a way where you plan to tease it for volume, this would work well for that. The spray gives fine hair a texture to it so that it can be teased and held into place. It can make hair have a slightly sticky texture, so teased hair holds together and doesn&#x27;t flatten out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It washes out easily with regular shampoo, without building up over time.</li>
    <li> I really have thick heavy hair, and it tends to pull the waves straight out.  I like that casual tousled look, but need help pulling it off.  The product works great, it smells good, leaves my hair looking tousled and shiny, no friz or crinkliness, or that greasy look that can follow.  Unfortunately, this stuff is full to the brim with parabens, 5 I think, known to be cancer causing.  While I want the look, I can&#x27;t justify using something so potentially dangerous.  Hopefully, Toni &amp; Guy will change the formula a bit.  I am forwarding this review to them, and hope others will do the same.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells GREAT, and does exactly what it should - which is give you that beach blown, salty look that a lot of people try to avoid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a little practice and patience to find the exact amount to get that tossed look but once you master that it is clear sailing (like what I did there?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful to avoid spraying your eyes since this does in fact contain heavy amounts of salt which you&#x27;ll regret if you accidentally spray your face!</li>
    <li> This Texturising Spray is absolutely perfect for making curls look and stay looking natural.  I spray it on when wet, and my curls dry soft, not crunchy or sticky.  The curl just bounces to life, and I don&#x27;t have to fight with my hair to accentuate the curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash my hair as usual, use conditioner and let it towel dry while I do my makeup.  Then, I use my normal styling product, spray my hair all over with this spray, and blow dry with a diffuser.  When it is dry, I spray my hair lightly again, and it is perfect!  I have soft, natural looking curls, without the crunchy, wet look.  I am able to get the curl definition I am looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With most styling products, my curls are left crunchy and wet looking.  I have very fine hair, so this makes my hair look terrible.  I have been looking for something that would stop this from happening.  I have found it!!!  I seriously won&#x27;t be buying anything else from now on.  I love this stuff!  You have to give this a try!</li>
    <li> Somedays i use this product just for the smell. Seriously, it should be a perfume. I have extremely thin, fine hair. I love this product. Spray on wet hair, tossle and let air dry and it looks fabulous.</li>
    <li> I tried this Toni &amp; Guy casual sea salt texturizing spray and it works too good! The smell is nice and it made my hair soft. Unfortunately I have thick wavy hair so when I used it my hair got puffier! A friend thought I just got a perm! This product is perfect for people with thin fine hair.</li>
    <li> I had never heard of sea salt spray before try this product.  It is definitely an interesting concept, and on my hair, it seem to work okay.  Not great, but okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TONI&amp;GUY CASUAL SEA SALT TEXTURISING SPRAY is supposed to give you a tousled, beachy look that you create with your fingers.  It also is supposed to give you a light hold.  Now, I have a lot of heavy hair, so there in no hold for me.  Also, I must warn you, do not brush or comb your hair after spraying it with TONI&amp;GUY CASUAL SEA SALT TEXTURISING SPRAY.  You end up with a kind of heavy, damp mess&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I do like smell quite a lot.  I reminds me (duh) of a warm, sunny day the beach.  Kind of soothing.  AND IF you spray TONI&amp;GUY CASUAL SEA SALT TEXTURISING SPRAY on your hair, AND IF you remember to style with fingers only, it does give you a nice, fresh, toussled look.  At least for a little while...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good for texturizing, specially if you have long hair,this is a product I hadn&#x27;t used but Toni and Guy make good products.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly thick Irish hair - I had fun with the product. When I don&#x27;t want to do much after I wash with shampoo, conditioner, add oil to protect and soften, I will add this and let my hair dry naturally. It keeps my curls in place and if I want to go out I use a strong hair spray. For me I used this in lieu of a creme to hold my style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I searched for the Toni &amp; Guy home page and they have how to video for all their products. This product is a\\&quot;TROPICAL TEXTURES\\&quot; and even though the model had long hair I got the general idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Casual Sea Salt Texturising Spray is used on your towel dry damp hair in conjunction with their \\&quot;heat protection mist\\&quot;. You then spray the Casual Sea Salt Texturising Spray liberally through your hair. Blow dry. Then use a curling iron \\&quot;to sections of your hair to add movement\\&quot; and finish with \\&quot;Flexible Hold Hairspray\\&quot;, the combination adds texture and body for a lived-in beach look helps create tousled, relaxed waves to hair that doesn&#x27;t already have them.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything.  It is just an extra step in the morning.  When I brush my hair out after it has dried, this product leaves a buildup and makes my hair seem heavy and dull.</li>
    <li> I have the most boring limp hair ever. I always wanted a sea salt spray to give my hair some texture but the products were way to expensive for me. I stumbled upon toni&amp;guy in a sample box and instantly fell in love. It really is magic for my hair. It allows me to have that tussled look and i adore it. It smells amazing and can be used on wet or dry hair. The best thing is that this product is affordable! I can finally have the hair i want without having to spend a fortune! Toni&amp;guy sea salt spray is now a daily routine in my house. Try it. You wont be sorry.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ll definitely need some natural curl to get the texture/beachy hair. But this does indeed create some nice tousles.  The smell is nice and it lasts for several hours before I have to reapply.</li>
    <li> I have naturally wavy hair so in theory it shouldn&#x27;t take much for to scrunch it up and hold it. In the past I&#x27;ve only used the Bumble and Bumble in the past which has a lot of stickiness. This doesn&#x27;t really enhance/ or texturize  my waves. It just holds them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I can&#x27;t give it anything lower than a two star review because it is says it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;Casual&amp;#34; spray, which I could interpret as having less hold, but I can&#x27;t give it higher than a two because I still think it should do more for my hair, considering I have a lot of fine wavy hair.</li>
    <li> I got a small free sample of this spray once and I&#x27;ve loved it ever since. I have extremely long and thick hair that is so bluntly straight. My hair never waves unless I leave it up while it&#x27;s wet but then my hair ends up being so flat in the morning. You can use this spray when your hair is dry and it actually makes my hair wave. Since my hair is so thick, I find that I have to spray a generous amount but it actually works and keeps in my hair all day. The  only spray I&#x27;ve found that works and smells really good, I probably will never use a different sea salt spray!</li>
    <li> I spritz it from mid-length to the ends once i&#x27;ve combed through my hair fresh out of the shower, then again once it&#x27;s a little more dry just to style it a little.  The smell reminds me of a Nautica cologne, and it can get a little overpowering when you&#x27;re layering, but on the plus-side you can tell it lasts all day!</li>
    <li> I have long, wavy hair and tend to let it air dry.  I have been using this spray after washing and towel drying my hair.  I spray a good amount all over my hair, scrunch and let air dry.  The result is nice, loose casual waves that hold up through out the day.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair crunchy or sticky like some other sprays.  The spray also has a nice light fragrance.  While I rated the spray 4 stars it&#x27;s not quite a 5.  A 5 for me would be if it completely eliminated the frizz which this spray does not.  It helps, just doesn&#x27;t do the job 100% and all my friends with wavy hair who let it air dry know what &amp;#34;frizz&amp;#34; I&#x27;m talking about.  Overall, this is a good option if you are looking for some texture and control for your naturally wavy hair that you want to wash and wear.</li>
    <li> We LOVE this spray!  It has been great for my daughters hair this summer.  She has just enough curl to be pretty, but not usually the whole day.  This keeps the wave nice and can be sprayed on dry hair when it starts looking too bed head!</li>
    <li> I have thin, -mostly- straight hair which has always been kind of a pita - have to alternate between several shampoos in a certain way, or it gets wayward, etc. It -can- look nice, but it makes you really work for it. Also, since I wash it every morning, curlers stopped being an option after a while. And then a friend of mine showed me this. Oh, how grateful I am to her!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product saved my hair and my nervous system from any further damage. I&#x27;ve tried many sea salt sprays since I discovered it, including Aquage and Not Your Mother&#x27;s, but nothing beats this one. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel heavy and unkempt like the others, and you don&#x27;t need a lot to make it work.&lt;br /&gt;I usually blow-dry my hair a little after shower (leaving it damp) while twisting locks around my finger, then spray this stuff lightly and let it dry naturally the rest of the way. This allows me to get easy waves with lots of texture. Just use it sparingly!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I never tried Salt Texturizing Spray before. My hair is wavy and fine but I have a lot of it. When I go to the shore, the wind and sea spray turns my hair into natural beach waves. Spraying this on dry hair has, at least for me with my hair&#x27;s properties, the same effect as a day at the shore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I&#x27;d recommend, though, is not to spray it too close to the roots. No one needs that much &#x27;texturing&amp;#34; that high up on their hair!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t stand the scent.  Terribly strong and overly perfumed.  Gave me an instant headache.</li>
    <li> Works great and smells amazing!</li>
    <li> for my wavy, semi-thick, medium length tresses, I have only achieved the perfect beach wave look once since owning this product. it acts as a lighter hair spray that will not be sticky nor leave white residue when you run your fingers through your hair. i currently use it to give my hair a bit more rough texture and tame frizziness. it is okay.</li>
    <li> This stuff is a hair miracle. Between a little dry shampoo and this stuff, I can end up with perfect beachy waves without washing my hair. I don&#x27;t use this with my hair down, it makes it too big. BUT in a high pony a bit of this makes it look like I just came back from riding in the waves. And it smells great.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair.  Sometimes my hair looks limp and lackluster.  After using this product I wonder why I didn&#x27;t use a texturizer before!!  It gave a nice feel and look to my hair.  My hair looked thicker.  I received a lot of compliments.  So I am hooked on this product.  Will especially use in spring/summer.  Loved it!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know, maybe my hair just has enough texture on its own.  The scent is ok, kind of outdoorsy, but I was hoping for a little more hold than it gives.  I use it after styling wax/blow dry, and it does give a bit more definition to the styling.  Probably good for thinner hair to give extra volume, but I don&#x27;t need it.</li>
    <li> Gives texture so curling iron will hold my fine slippery hair. Perfect for my needs.</li>
    <li> What a waste of money! I used to love another brand of sea salt texturizing spray but they haven&#x27;t made that in years. I always liked how my hair looked, it gave it body but it also gave my wavy hair some great curl.&lt;br /&gt;This spray on the other hand doesn&#x27;t give my hair any body and just makes it oily. And it smells like perfume. It really is just like spraying a water and scented oil mix on my hair. I actually use jojoba oil on my hair sometimes and that doesn&#x27;t make it look greasy or oily. Save your money, this is a terrible product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product (purchased from a reputable online retailer) for about 6 months. I love it for the soft smell, and the way it gives my hair nice, voluminous waves without drying it or making it crunchy. The product I recieved immediately made my hair feel like straw upon applying it, and smelled like I&#x27;d sprayed strong perfume all over the place. The scent is similar, but not the same and much stronger than what I was using. This is either old or fake. I noticed some of the printing was missing from the bottle- not like it was rubbed off, but like it was never fully printed to begin with. Buyer beware. I bought directly from Amazon so I&#x27;m a little surprised, but this isn&#x27;t the first time this has happened to me. If you want this product, purchase elsewhere. It really is excellent if you get the real thing.</li>
    <li> My hair is fairly long so I give volumizers and texturizers a work-out. I liked being able to spray this on but it doesn&#x27;t hold as well as other products I&#x27;ve tried. I also don&#x27;t care for the way this one dries. It can create some itchy patches if you get it on your roots. The odor is pleasant and not overpowering. Dries pretty quickly. I get better results when used a little more sparingly.</li>
    <li> I often buy hair products to try to give my fine, flat hair some body. Usually the work in an okay way...but nothing special. Either they don&#x27;t smell good, are too sticky, or get my hands all sticky, or stiff. So I usually just buy something else next time to see if I like it better. This stuff however, is different from anything I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You just spritz it on when your hair is wet, and dry (I use a blow dryer when I use &amp;#34;products&amp;#34;...didn&#x27;t try this with an air-dry.) As soon as your done you will notice your hair looks...bigger. Not Motley Crue big...but fluffy. And it has a texture which is VERY much like how your hair feels after being on the beach--like there is something in your hair...almost dirty, but in a pleasant way. Not crunch, not sticky, just bigger. I often use those [[ASIN:B0002JKPB8 Caruso steam rollers]] to give my hair curls or waves (depending on the size of the roller. And with this, my curls last DAYS...seriously. They are there until I wash them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance of the product is light. I sometimes like the perfume-y, pretty smelling things, but they never last anyway, so minimal fragrance is fine. And it isn&#x27;t a bad smell (sometimes they smell cheap or medicinal or something.) It doesn&#x27;t seem to add any shine, which most texturizers don&#x27;t, and I suppose they are different products. Shine with slippery stuff, no extra shine with thickening stuff...maybe shine makes your hair strands too smooth...so you lose texture. You can always add a shine-type spray at the end if you really like that. I have some argan holding spray that I use anyway, so it does add a little shine that this hides.&lt;br /&gt;This is something I will definitely replace when it is gone!</li>
    <li> I have tried several salt sprays and this one ranks in the middle. I have long thick wavy brunette hair, and I use this in two ways.  1- Spray it on wet hair and dry naturally for a tousled natural look.  2- Spray it on dry slept-on hair in the mornings when I don&#x27;t have time to shower - I have all these short wispy hairs around my face that stick out when I sleep on them - so this products helps them scrunch up and lay down a bit.  Very nice texture and reasonable price. I am docking one star because the scent is way too strong for my personal tastes.</li>
    <li> I have fine, straight hair.  It doesn&#x27;t really have any texture or waves in it naturally.  It also has absolutely no body.  I always try to do something to give it body, but at the same time, not take more time for me to get ready in the morning.  For this, I sprayed it on my hair right after some brief towel drying.  Then I got ready and blow dried my hair the rest of the way.  There was no change.  The next day I left my hair in the towel for a little while longer while getting dressed, then sprayed it on my hair and attempted to let it air dry the rest of the way.  I still didn&#x27;t see any results.  Other than it making my hair smell good, I&#x27;m not seeing any difference.</li>
    <li> I have tried many &#x27;sea salt&#x27; spray products, Bumble+Bumble, Charlotte Ronson the most expensive. So far the best results I&#x27;ve had (including the Toni&amp;Guy product) has been from L&#x27;Oreal. The L&#x27;Oreal product did dry my hair out a bit though, that&#x27;s why I was excited to try this spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lots of people have complained about the smell, but I love it!! Can&#x27;t get enough of it. And yes you can smell it for hours, so if that&#x27;s not your thing then you won&#x27;t like it. My husband loves the smell of my hair when I use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good product for other uses for me but NOT as a &#x27;sea salt texture&#x27; spray. Try as I might, dry/wet/damp, this spray will not give me the beachy, piecey look I can get with L&#x27;oreal&#x27;s product. This acts more like a light hair spray than a texturizing spray. When I&#x27;m on 2nd or 3rd day flatironed hair and it&#x27;s getting a little lank looking, I like to spray this lightly on the lower half of my hair and it gives me a little bit of texture but with some stiffness that I don&#x27;t like. It does make my hair look better so that&#x27;s why it isn&#x27;t getting three stars. I also don&#x27;t like that I MUST wash my hair the next day if I use this product, there is simply no dealing with my hair once this stuff is in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a pinch I used it to spray the underside of my hair this morning (2nd day flatironed) and it did give some lift, but again there is that residual stiffness. After some time out in the high blowing wind though my hair looked amazing, and still had the lift. I do like the product overall and will keep using it but not to get that tousled beach effect I want, for that I&#x27;ll stick to the L&#x27;Oreal (bot not often as it dries my hair out)  The Toni&amp;Guy product does NOT dry out my hair, ironically---but it also doesn&#x27;t give me the look I want on the ends like other products. I&#x27;d still try other Toni&amp;Guy products based on how nice this particular one is.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing. Gives my wavy hair a bit more of a defined curls look. Just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> The smell is amazing! !! Works great for texture.</li>
    <li> This stuff is yummy. I think it smells like cinnamon. I use it when my hair is damp and then just scrunch my hair. It works well and also doesn&#x27;t feel crunchy all ALL. I usually use a cheapy spray gel (daily) and scrunch...but might switch to this for daily use. It is a little spendy, but the texture of the hair looks better and less.....ghetto?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had thick, wavy hair, and I was very excited when the &amp;#34;beach waves&amp;#34; look became so trendy. It&#x27;s the only look that is remotely natural for me. The only problem is that my hair won&#x27;t hold the wave for very long. This sea salt has been the solution! I spray some in when my hair is almost dry, throw it into a loose bun, and when I let it out I have perfect beach waves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus: This sea salt spray smells fantastic. I was complimented on the smell and asked what kind of &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34; I was wearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can also be used as a texturizing spray for buns, braids and other updos. Recommended!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a few sea salt sprays and this one has worked the best, even better than one that was 2x the price.&lt;br /&gt;Of all the Toni&amp; Guy products, so far I like this one the best.&lt;br /&gt;It does seem a bit strongly fragrant right out of the bottle, but that calms down.  It leaves my hair looking very wind swept- nice and wave.  All I have to do is spray it and scrunch it and let it dry.  It still feels as soft as when it was first washed with conditioner- very nice, and soft, not at all unnatural like some mouse or other products do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a generous size container, and the sprayer is good to distribute the product well.  I&#x27;ve heard of people making their own spray but I&#x27;ve not tried that yet, so I can&#x27;t compare it to that.  I love that my hair smells good, is wavy, and still very soft and not at all sticky.</li>
    <li> I have to admit that as a girl with long hair, I got this out of at least a partial idle curiosity about how much a product like this actually does. Despite the fact that Toni &amp; Guy is a pretty prestige brand, the descriptors on this are pretty vague -- it adds texture. It adds a &#x27;beachy&#x27; feel, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The funny part is, I grew up on and off on a sailboat (even crossing the Atlantic at 14 with my Dad), so I&#x27;m kind of a tough customer here. I&#x27;m not gonna romanticize salt water getting in your hair as some unsung wonder treatment everyone should try -- in reality, salt-water hair feels oily and grainy at the same time and is no fun at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But with all that said, this isn&#x27;t a bad product.  The spray is light and does provide some hold. It&#x27;s an odd product because it provided a nice casual &amp;#34;run your fingers through your hair&amp;#34; effect and hold, although it also tended to make my clean hair instantly feel just a little gritty and dirty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just not a sensation I actively seek out and enjoy. I enjoyed trying out the product but wouldn&#x27;t necessarily tell you to run out and get your own immediately.  I also suspect that it&#x27;s lighter and more successful for buyers with short hair.</li>
    <li> I use this spray almost every day.  It gives my hair nice separation in a beachy look but does not make it heavy or feel greasy by the end of the day.  I am one of those people that have to wash their hair daily or it gets greasy and some products like straighteners are too heavy and feel gross by the end of the day.  It has a pleasant smell to it also.</li>
    <li> It smells good, but I don&#x27;t find it does anything for my hair.  My hair is fine and wavy and a product like this should work perfectly.</li>
    <li> My wife love this for her hair.  Many positive comments and friends are now using it as well.</li>
    <li> Gives hair a tousled, textured look without the crunchiness of other hair products.  I love how natural my hair looks when I use this, like I just came from the beach.  And another plus is that it smells great!  I don&#x27;t even put on perfume the days I use it.</li>
    <li> I got this product through a birch box. By the way absolutely love birch box. I now get it through Amazon subscribe and save. I am a life time customer now! I even bought a couple bottles for Christmas presents for friends. Every time my best friend comes over  she loves to use it.</li>
    <li> Great product for fine hair!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to control my curls, but this this stuff makes it easy and it smells divine! I think I love the scent more than anything.</li>
    <li> Life is beachy sweet, and after reading the description of creating \\&quot;a beachy, lived-in look with TONI&amp;GUY Casual Sea Salt Texturising Spray,\\&quot; I couldn&#x27;t wait to try the product and \\&quot;create tousled waves with natural movement.\\&quot; To me a full life has to have full-textured hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A durable, attractive light-lime colored bottle arrived at my house, and I tried it instantly. First, on dry hair. I squirted the lightly sweet, appealing spray on my hair with high expectations. The end result was a stringy, wet-look of semi-tousled hair. The next morning, I followed the directions and applied the product evenly to the roots of my just-shampooed hair with the tip of the bottle. Sorry folks, after blow drying and styling my hair, the texture and \\&quot;pumped-up red carpet volume\\&quot; was flat-out flat. Nada. Perhaps the top models that use this TONI&amp;GUY product are just born with great hair. Being fair, I tried the spray numerous times afterwards with the same lackluster results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a beachy look, I wouldn&#x27;t look to this bottle; the \\&quot;shore\\&quot; thing is the shore itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stacy Lytwyn, Marketing Guru/Motivational Speaker/Journalist&lt;br /&gt;Author: CONSUMMATE CONNECTICUT: DAY TRIPS WITH PANACHE&lt;br /&gt;Ace Blogger: WTF: Where&#x27;s the Faith, wtfwheresthefaith.wordpress.com/</li>
    <li> I love the way this product smells and it does a decent job of creating natural waves, though my hair has a natural wave so don&#x27;t know how it would work on straight or curly hair.</li>
    <li> Like what it does to my hair, but not the over powering perfume smell.  I get a headache every time.  Unfortunately I&#x27;ll have to find another brand to try out.</li>
    <li> The Toni and Guy Sea Salt spray provides a basic hairspray that allows your hair to be textured when styling. There is a slight ocean smell to it, likely from the sea salt name. Overall though by the middle of the day though it feels like no product was used. For the price, I would not purchase this product again. There are several great styling products out there and this is not one of them.</li>
    <li> Perfect for summer wavy hair! It is slightly sticky so I prefer to use it on wet hair, but it can be used on wet or dry. Perfect if you have curly hair, helpful if you have wavy hair and super key if you have straight hair that you want to curl. I fall in the middle and I like that it boosts my existing waves. I don&#x27;t find myself using it outside of the summer time months, but I definitely like it and pull it out each May to use!</li>
    <li> Less effective than the original product (in the UK).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a sucker for trying things to get my fine straight hair, do something other than hang there.  Well this is another try and didn&#x27;t work very good.  The smell was nice and easy to use, but it didn&#x27;t add any additional texture to my hair.  Still on the hunt for that perfect product.</li>
    <li> This product worked moderately well once I got the hang of using it, but once I read what was in it, I decided I&#x27;m never using it again.  It&#x27;s full of parabens.  So do your research and determine if this is something you&#x27;re willing to use.  I have relatively long, thick, naturally wavy (and frizzy) hair, but I never really put any products in it besides shampoo and conditioner.  If I wear my  hair curly, I will put some moose and/or hair spray in.  I&#x27;ve never been willing to do any type of keratin treatment, etc. - so this product isn&#x27;t going to stay in my house.  Just wanted to point that out.  Upon first glance, I saw that it was &amp;#34;sea salt&amp;#34; spray and didn&#x27;t think to check the lengthy list of ingredients before agreeing to give it a go.</li>
    <li> I have a shoulder length deconstructed bob and I use sea salt texturizing sprays to style my hair. I&#x27;ve tried many, many different brands and Beach Chic from Garnier was my favorite, until I tried this one. This Toni &amp; Guy product gives my hair the perfect texture for the messy look I aim for. It also adds lots of volume and there is no crunchy, tangled feel to my hair like I would get from the other brands. I wait until my hair is almost dry (it won&#x27;t work on wet hair) then I spray it all over while lifting sections up, then I scrunch my hair with my hands (twisting the front pieces) and then let it air dry (using a blow dryer only makes my hair frizzy). It&#x27;s so easy and my hair looks great. I love this product and I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> My hair is normal, average... It has a little bit of a wave when I let it air dry- but not much. This spray is amazing. It really looks like I just stepped off a day of laying out at the beach. The Casual Sea Salt Spray is the best one I&#x27;ve tried yet, it is probably the third or fourth and so far nothing else compares. It is light and doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel gross. Doesn&#x27;t feel heavy at all- but make sure not to spray too much, or you won&#x27;t get the look you&#x27;re going for. You&#x27;ll get the best results when using it if you blow dry until your hair is only damp, spray, then let it air dry. Looks good too if you want to apply when it is dry or wet, but I don&#x27;t get the &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; waves that way.</li>
    <li> We loved the scent, and the way soft effect it did on our hair. Would be nice if your local hair treatment salon has it, you can have it try on sample, and see if it works for you.</li>
    <li> This spray is fantastic year round for that light casual look with silky soft hair and just enough hold to not make your hair feel like a batch of straw being held together with glue.  Wonderful fragrance and easy application makes this a must have for the days when you just need that different do.  Wonderful product from a company that really cares.</li>
    <li> My favorite sea salt spray is Davines More Inside. I think it provides nice body without getting crunchy and I love the smell. Toni &amp; Guy gives a decent lift during the first few hours of the day but I never felt like it lasted long. It was too watery and it didn&#x27;t smell as nice. Further the smell lingers forever. If you are sensitive to this sort of thing, I&#x27;d definitely try to find a bottle in the store and gift it a sniff. I used it for about a week and kept reaching for the product that I paid for rather than this one that I got for free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick, black hair that is very straight.</li>
    <li> Love it! I love the smell as well :) people notice you&#x27;re around</li>
    <li> I got this stuff because sometimes get my hair styled with sea salt spray when I get it cut. I have not used it. It was not until I took the cap off that I realized that the horrible overbearing chemical perfume smell I am asphyxiated with on the train every morning is actually this stuff. Tone it down! Why does anyone need to smell like a chemical spill? Not everyone has a dull sense of smell. While I can see that this would smell nice if it was heavily diluted, to someone like myself who hasn&#x27;t destroyed my sense of smell huffing acetone, nail polish and other harsh &amp;#34;beauty products&amp;#34; on a regular basis, this stuff is overkill.</li>
    <li> I love this spray.  Doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down and gives a nice wavy curl.  It doesn&#x27;t last to the next day, but I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to.  Great smell too.</li>
    <li> This makes my hair have just the look I go for!</li>
    <li> I bought this product a week or so ago and have been using it on my wavy hair. I don&#x27;t have a lot of time to style my hair anymore, so I love that this product gives me gorgeous waves with so little effort. I can spray it in and let my hair air dry for a natural, beachy look or I can spray it in and use my blow dryer&#x27;s diffuser to give me a more voluminous, sexy look. This spray smells amazing and definitely gives my hair the texture and hold I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
