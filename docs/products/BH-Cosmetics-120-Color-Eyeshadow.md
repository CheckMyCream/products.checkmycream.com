      <li>but I won&#x27;t be using many colors from it.</li>
      <li>The new design is great.</li>

      <li>They are very soft which makes them easy to apply a lot of pigment for good color</li>
      <li>The colors are bright and beautiful, and they so many different colors that its hard to choose the ones I liked the most.</li>
      <li>but the BH box is came in read &#x27;5th edition&#x27; and was even bubble wrapped lightly with a sticker that read &#x27;5th edition&#x27;.</li>
      <li>I enjoy BH cosmetics eyeshadow palettes.</li>

      <li>This are awesome endless combinations for any ocassion, they stay on, gentle on my skin, i would buy another palette!</li>
      <li>and I got the 3rd edition instead which consists of bright colors, not the somewhat neutral colors I had wanted in the 5th.</li>

      <li>I have yet to actually use the makeup yet, but I&#x27;m already in love!</li>
      <li>I own the 3rd edition and use that one practically every day that I wear makeup.</li>
      <li>so it is totally worth it.</li>
      <li>A good product, but when I received was Crushed</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This was the first shadow palette I&#x27;ve ever purchased. To me, it&#x27;s great! I have all the colors I would eve need! There&#x27;s a lot of browns, a few blacks and grays, and there are bright colors (corals, purples, greens, etc) in matte and shimmer.</li>
    <li> The eyeshadows were amazing. The only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars and not 5 is because it wasn&#x27;t handled well, I had to do a decent amount of shadow repairs</li>
    <li> Lots of different color choices..very blendable...my only complaint is that I wish there was a better way to ship eyeshadow. When I recieved the palatte 4 of the shadows were cracked which was a huge pain to clean up.</li>
    <li> Such a good deal, so many colors, and lasts all day when I apply the NYX eyeshadow base. The eyeshadows could blend a little bit better, but overall I couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
    <li> I received the palette quickly.  The colors are pigmented and I love the variety.  The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was one of the colors had broke during shipping and was all over the case and inside.  But other than that, I am VERY satisfied.</li>
    <li> The color doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as I would like it to. I usually use Smashbox and Laura Geller and those shadows last all day.</li>
    <li> So, I ordered this one and I got the 3rd edition instead which consists of bright colors, not the somewhat neutral colors I had wanted in the 5th. It was really disappointing. And there were a few broken pieces too! Overall, I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great starter kit. I enjoy BH cosmetics eyeshadow palettes. It arrived without any broken shadows. I used it for around 6 months before giving it to my sister. The quality more than exceeds the price. The colors are true, especially if used wet or with a primer. I only gave it to my sister because all of the choices were alittle overwhelming for me, but she enjoys lots of colors. Love it. I will probably order something more neutral or smaller next.</li>
    <li> A good product, but when I received was Crushed</li>
    <li> I usually wear Mac and don&#x27;t ever want to wear anything else but a friend of mine was wearing these and I loved how her blending and vibrancy in color looked so I decided to give them a try. They are very soft which makes them easy to apply a lot of pigment for good color and they are very blend able. They wore well all day but I wear an eyeshadow base (by MAC) so that may have helped as well. You get plenty of beautiful colors so the eyeshadows themselves I would give a4-5 stars. the reason I give fewer stars is because of the companies shipping method. They shipped the eyeshadows in a bubble envelope and so half of them came broken and mixed in other colors making the most of the palette useless. I have read multiple other reviews that say the same thing as well. I decided to try getting another palette and returning the original palette. When the second palette arrived it was in perfect condition since it was bubble wrapped and shipped in a box instead of an envelope but in the end I had to pay the price for 2 palettes when they should have made it right the first time.</li>
    <li> Great colors and lovely for the price.</li>
    <li> I love this palette! Beautiful colors and the tones are perfect for my hazel eyes. The new design is great. I love the mirror and how sturdy the case feels. BH cosmetics is the best makeup for such a great price. I ♡ BH COSMETICS!</li>
    <li> I have yet to actually use the makeup yet, but I&#x27;m already in love! Shipping was super fast and after immediately inspecting the palet as soon as it came to my door, I was happy to see no colors were broken or leaking in any way. I did some swatches and the colors are great, very pigmented and blend well. It makes a huge difference using a primer (I use Urban Decay primer potion, the best out there!) the colors appear so much better using it. I bought 2 palets at once and will probably be ordering the others in the 120 collection. I literally have any color I would ever need! For myself and my clients. Pretty good quality for the price! Needless to say I was pleasantly suprised!</li>
    <li> Better than we thought--much more compact and fairly priced.  Packaging and delivery were also great, and the advertisement is accurate.</li>
    <li> Good product. Shades are highly pigmented</li>
    <li> all the BH palattes i have are great, very pigmented and last me forever! i would highly rec these to anyone.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my sister and she loved it. I own the 3rd edition and use that one practically every day that I wear makeup.</li>
    <li> loving this pallet i use it everyday needs a set of blue shades though i cant complain great price and great pigment</li>
    <li> I was so exited to get this palette because I love BH Cosmetics but this palette was disappointing. When the package arrived at least 6 of the eye shadow pans were loose and fell out, none of them were broken some had little chips in them but I had to super glue the pans back in. I ordered this palette because it looked like it had a lot of neutral colors in it as well as some other colors but they weren&#x27;t as pigmented as I had hoped and some of the shimmer colors seemed to be just glitter with hardly any color. You defiantly have to use a primer with these eye shadows. I had to dip my brush quite a few times to get the color I wanted, even so i don&#x27;t think the color payoff was even close to as good as BH&#x27;s other palette&#x27;s. I&#x27;ve seen a lot better quality from BH&#x27;s other palette&#x27;s. This makes me quite sad. Sorry. I think the price should have been a lot lower for the quality. It is still use-able but it is NOT the best by any means, you do get a lot of product though pans are a little smaller than a quarter or about the same size. Could have been better. I do love the 88 shimmer palette but this 5th edition disappointed me a lot.</li>
    <li> LOVE BH Cosmetics but unfortunately i didn&#x27;t receive the right edition i got the 3rd instead of the 5th... also two of the eyeshadows broke during shipping... but all in all good product!</li>
    <li> I was excited to order this because everyone on youtube uses bh cosmetics. When I received it I had gotten the 3rd edition. No big deal I&#x27;ll return it and get a new one. I made sure to ask them how they could be sure that I would get the right one and they told me that they would put a note on my order. Didn&#x27;t work because I received the 3rd edition again. I got a refund and could keep the palette but I won&#x27;t be using many colors from it. Customer service told me to go elsewhere to buy the palette until they fix this problem.</li>
    <li> So I just got this and me being excited about new makeup I wanted to check it out so I opened the package and my eye shadows were all over....broken apart and mixed falling out....I&#x27;m so disappointed I had herd good things about bh cosmetics but now I&#x27;m just horribly disappointed..</li>
    <li> loved the colors and thanks to GOOD PACKAGE ARRIVED IN PERFECT CONDITION, NO EYE SHADOWS DIGICEL. They are not boronosas and the product is compact.</li>
    <li> Great colors. I had a couple in mine come broken though.&lt;br /&gt;Not any colors of use. But yea some came broken.</li>
    <li> Bad pallte I do not recommend at all</li>
    <li> Love the different colors for a decent price. Long lasting pigment.</li>
    <li> Love this. Color lasts</li>
    <li> I love the eyeshadows amd they are very pigmented however when i received my palette a few eyeshadows were broken</li>
    <li> The colors were not as pigmented as I expected but they were very easy to blend.</li>
    <li> Product as described, great price, great seller!</li>
    <li> two of the eyeshadows where broken but other then that i have 1 &amp; 3 and has colors that they do not have and great high light colors so did not expect them at all and great bronze colors very pigmented</li>
    <li> I havent tried this item yet, but the first thing I noticed when I opened it was that one of the brown eyeshadows on the bottom palette was broken. I was very sad about it. I chatted online with an Amazon rep who said they could not just send a new one because it was sold by BH Cosmetics. I informed the agent that I would keep the item if they could do something for me and they gave me back a partial refund of it. I am about to go put on some of this eyeshadow. The colors in it are very pretty though. True to the picture. Very nice mixture of matte and sparkly colors.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase. I like all the colors. The eye shadow applies well and lasta all day.</li>
    <li> I love this ! Colors are very pigmented and a lot of colors to choos from !</li>
    <li> Os produtos chegaram completamente quebrados, hate!</li>
    <li> It was the exact product I wanted but it arrived with a few chipped eyeshadows. The broken powder made a giant mess when I removed the palette from the box. It made me sad because it was meant as a birthday present. :(</li>
    <li> This are awesome endless combinations for any ocassion, they stay on, gentle on my skin, i would buy another palette!</li>
    <li> The palette arrived in great shape however the variety of colors is extremely lacking. I must have at least 30-45 shades of brown eye shadows!!!  Who needs that? Especially. because Im African American. This palette lacks color, only a few to choose from. I wldnt recommend this product.</li>
    <li> In love with it.. have No complaints ..it&#x27;s a must buy.. nice colors n doesn&#x27;t wear off all day long..</li>
    <li> I love BH but I got this and there was a couple of them shattered.</li>
    <li> This is the best in terms of basic colors that you will use and blend everyday. If you are a beginner or simply amplifying your collection. I personally did not have any problems with broken shadows and I&#x27;m really impressed with the pigmentation and quality of this product. I cant wait to finish it so I can purchase another one.</li>
    <li> Although I like the quality of the powder a few of the pods were broken when I received them. I would have complained so much had it have not been some of my favorite colors.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to receive this item as one of my friends had bought it off of the company website. When I received it, there was eye shadow all over the inside of the package. Then when I removed the bubble wrap, the palette box was completely broken!! There was eye shadow all over the place. I opened the palette and every single pod inside was destroyed, eye shadow mixing together in every piece. Some of the pods were missing all together. I was very unhappy and won&#x27;t even dare try to order another one once I return this one.</li>
    <li> Makeup was broken when i received it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. Not worth all the hype in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I love the colors. A great palette that can be used to create many neutral looks as well as some brighter looks.</li>
    <li> This is a really good pallette for neutral lovers. The quality is amazing , I have  used nothing but BH eyeshadows since I discovered them two years ago : )</li>
    <li> The colors didnt show up as expected. its probably because i am not doing it right. One of my colours broke during shipping but other than that i love it. :)</li>
    <li> This package came way sooner than expected and I am in LOVE!!! So many beautiful colors and none of them were broken. It was packaged really well. My sister is an esthetician and I bought this palette because she recommended this product. I have worn them to work for about a week now and my makeup lasted all day. The price is great. I have purchased single eyeshadows for the price of this palette so it is totally worth it.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t the colors shown in the picture... But nonetheless, the palette I received has more color options and I am pleased. I believe the one I received is the 1st or 2nd edition.</li>
    <li> some of the eye shadows are broken, possibly during shipment.  I love this brand but these are matte I was looking for more shimmer too</li>
    <li> Love all the colors except it was pretty messy and the black eyeshadow in front a good chunk of it came off so now it&#x27;s missing a piece.  Could&#x27;ve been shipped better but other than that no complaints</li>
    <li> This is the second time I order this palette because i love the colors. So I got this one for my mom. She loved it! Sadly one of the colors came in crushed but nothing we can&#x27;t fix :) It is for any skin type and the colors are amazing. I really do recommend this product. Also if you do get one try not to toss it or lift them upwards because they will fall out. I don&#x27;t know if mine would but i rather keep them the way i received them, in tact.</li>
    <li> Received this product on time, but broken AND THE WRONG EDITION. I ordered the 5th edition which, if you&#x27;ve researched this, is DIFFERENT from the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th... WELL, I was given the 3rd edition. There must be an issue with quality control, since the palette was the 3rd edition but the BH box is came in read &#x27;5th edition&#x27; and was even bubble wrapped lightly with a sticker that read &#x27;5th edition&#x27;. Also arrived to me very damaged, as several pots were shattered. There was an orange/gold mess all inside the box, despite the bubble wrapping. I opened the palette and the pots&#x27; colors were everywhere, made a huge mess. Could be the bubble wrap couldn&#x27;t protect a product that&#x27;s not well made to begin with. Maybe the shadows aren&#x27;t packed in as tightly as they should be, because my Coastal Scents palette came with much less bubble wrap than this did and it arrived in mint condition. Anyway, I wanted a simple replacement, but was told by the Amazon representative, who was very helpful, that the seller does not do replacements and that I would have to return and get a refund, then order the product all over again. Forget it, I just returned it and ordered something else from a different company.&lt;br /&gt;The product itself was OKAY. The CS palette I ordered in lieu of this disappointment was way better than this mess. The BH palette has some nicely pigmented colors, mostly the shimmer/pearl ones. But the matte, which I was most interested in, had very poor pigmentation. I tried swatching on my arm over some eyeshadow primer, they didn&#x27;t last more than an hour without falling off.&lt;br /&gt;Save your money, look into higher-end shadows or try Coastal Scents (I got the Warm palette with comes with many good matte neutral colors, but they also have beautiful colorful palettes) like I did and receive better service and product.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for Christmas as a gift and had to return it as it was just a mess of shattered shadows. It was very disappointing. I thought I would try again after the holidays so that the shipping handlers might be a bit more delicate in their handling of the product due to the insanity of the holidays and the next pallet  came intact with the exception of one shade that was slightly damaged. the colors are highly pigmented and easily applied. It is a beautiful set if only it could arrive in one piece.</li>
    <li> I love this palette. Even though I ordered the 5th edition and they sent me the 4th, its a very good quality without spending too much! Totally worth it!</li>
    <li> This is my first BH cosmetics product, but I had heard great things about it. It did get delivered with a few cracks in one or two of the colors, but I think thats understandable considering the delivery. It was nothing I couldn&#x27;t fix or live with. ANYWAY, about the shadows. I really do like this palette. Some of the shadows have better payoff than others, but overall I really like the diversity of the colors and the quality. This is a great palette to have and I definitely suggest it!</li>
    <li> The colors are bright and beautiful, and they so many different colors that its hard to choose the ones I liked the most.</li>
    <li> A couple of the eyeshadows were broken and are almost unusable. I was a little disappointed but everything else was okay.</li>
    <li> After we opened the box on this item, there were several eyeshadows that were broken. I have tried unsuccessfully, several times to contact the seller. Very dissappointed.</li>
    <li> As always an excellent brand, only this time I get one broken and no one took responsibility</li>
    <li> Lovely set. Absolutely worth it</li>
    <li> So much variety and the palette contained matte and shimmer eye shadows...looooovvved it!!!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical on buying makeup online but I bit the bullet and got bh cosmetics 5th editon. I thought it would be more matte colors but it seems there&#x27;s shimmer in 75% of the palette. Next time I&#x27;ll get the 88 matte palette. On a brighter note, the delivery was quick.</li>
    <li> The first look at this product, I had no broken piece when it came. The colours are really nice. i haven&#x27;t use it as yet, but i have previous BH eyeshadows and i know the quality of the product</li>
    <li> Love the colors. Good quantity and qulIty for the price. Applies nice and blends well.  3 colors were broken when I got it but otherwise happy with the purchase</li>
    <li> I bought it online on the wesite of bh cosmetics. I got in 1 week with a good condition. The bh cosmetics eyeshadow is chalky texture that you got dig in to it. You HAVE TO WET YOUR Brush To Apply makeup. I hate its that is very few eyeshadow is soft and pigment while other is hard to get on the brush to apply on your lid. If I had known this I wouldn&#x27;t buy again. I rather save $20-$50 for high-end makeup. Holiday high-end makeup is better to buy than Bh. Holiday makeup is very pigment get neutral and fun colors. Sigma, Smashbox, and Lora have makeup on sell on thier website. I&#x27;m tired of buying cheap makeup on drugstore dont work or online makeup like Bh doesnt work, too JUST SAVE YOUR MONEY ON HIGH-MAKEUP On Sell!! Or Buy Coastal Scent hot pot $1.99 or on sell for .99 Or Makeupgeek eyeshadow pot for $5</li>
