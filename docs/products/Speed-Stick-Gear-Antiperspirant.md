<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have used this deodorant for sometime.  It works.  I stay dry.  It does have a waxy residue, but this is how it works.  It appears non-comedogenic.</li>
    <li> I got this free from Influenster! It definitely works 48 hours with heavy activity. I would definitely recommend that this product is purchased!</li>
    <li> **Full disclosure: I received a complimentary sample of this product from Speed Stick for testing purposes**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me start by saying that I found no inherent issues with this product. It is a good antiperspirant &amp; deodorant, but I found the scent to be a little stronger than I like. I prefer a more subtle scent, rather than the strong, ever-present scent this product provides, which takes me back to middle school when all the boys were smothering themselves in Axe Body Spray. If you like a stronger smell, then I would say this is a great product; but for those who want something more along the lines of classic Old Spice I would say look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying I was never a fan of white stick deodorant but now I am. The scent is really nice and long lasting. By mistake there was a couple of days where I may have left the house with out putting some one and the drycore actually works! I was a little self conscious, but I had nothing to worry about. I will most definitely purchase this again and again. Good bye Old Spice!</li>
    <li> I was able to review Speed Stick via Influenster and I have to say I like it. The scent is not too strong and it keeps me as dry as other &amp;#34;big&amp;#34; names. All in all... I am happy and will continue to use it!</li>
    <li> I received this product to try, compliments of Influenster. I was anxious to try it, but hesitant at the same time. I have sensitive skin and some deodorants will break me out. The first day I used this product, I didn&#x27;t notice any type of rash or sign of irritation, so I knew I was &amp;#34;in the green&amp;#34;. The scent wasn&#x27;t as fresh as I would have liked it, but GEAR really lasted all day and kept me fresh! I would definitely recommend it to others to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I received this deodorant free from Influenster. I was a little hesitant at first because it was a solid. I was very pleased with this product. Even after a long day I am still dry and it still smells like I just put it on.</li>
    <li> Disclaimer: I was sent a trial pack of 2 speed stick gears from @influenstervoxbox.  Thanks Influenster!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, there&#x27;s really not much to rave about in any deodorant, as long as they do their job and smell halfway decent.  Usually I stick with Old Spice, but occasionally it breaks apart towards the end which can be annoying.  So far I&#x27;ve yet to experience this with Speed Stick Fresh Force, so that&#x27;s a point for Speed Stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This deodorant definitely does it&#x27;s job well and smells good too.  And to be honest it feels like it goes on lighter than my other deodorant - sometimes Old Spice seems like it can get caked on there and then doesn&#x27;t even come off in the shower sometimes.  Not with Speed Stick Fresh Force.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time I&#x27;m in the store, I&#x27;m certainly going to consider making the switch from Old Spice to Speed Stick.</li>
    <li> Apparently, there’s this new stuff out from Speed Stick called SpeedStickGEAR. It smells awesome, and I got to try it from Influenster at absolutely no charge. So, in my personal review of it, I’d have to say 48 hours of protection for a fat boy like me comes in handy, and the ladies seem to like it.</li>
    <li> I got this free from @influenstervoxbox to try out and give my honest opinion.  And let me tell you, I use coupons and buy whatever I can get the best price on.  But these SpeedStickGEAR are the best I&#x27;ve ever tried!  I was in the process of moving from one house to another when I got these in.  My pits stayed dry during the entire moving process thanks to this!  I was sweating everywhere BUT my pits, actually.  I&#x27;m quite impressed!</li>
    <li> Deodorant lasts long and does not have an overpowering scent.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone who asks!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best deodorants I&#x27;ve tried but the only thing I haven&#x27;t found on this product just like others like it is keeping things completely dry!!!  But other than that it&#x27;s great.  Love the scent and that it&#x27;s not harsh on the skin.</li>
    <li> Received 2 from @influenstervoxbox and I am quiet impressed with the product. It smells great and last long into the next day. It got me switched from Old Spice.</li>
    <li> I received 2 sticks of Speed Stick deodorant through Influenster, and I could not have been more pleasantly surprised! The deodorant claims to last 48 hours, which I sort of doubted at first, but it actually lasts! The Drycore smells really awesome and I will definitely be switching deodorants now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not real whipped up about the fragrance of this antipersperant, but it does work really well. Nothing bad about this product, but I have it only four stars because of the fragrance.</li>
    <li> After using the same product for a number of years, I chose to give Speed Stick GEAR a try when I received it as a complimentary product from Influenster. I had seen the commercials and thought I would give it a shot. It certainly does keep me dry. In fact, it was weird for me at first to get used to just how dry it actually made me. It wasn&#x27;t a bad thing, I just wasn&#x27;t used to it. I don&#x27;t know that I would go 48 hours without re-applying (and I&#x27;m not really in favor of putting on deodorant every 2 days in general), but the product has met my expectations and I would recommend it for anyone, especially those who are physically active and need to remain dry.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 4x/week tennis player and this antiperspirant keeps me nearly 100% dry. I&#x27;m not a crazy sweater, but I&#x27;ve found this Speed Stick to work throughout the day and it doesn&#x27;t wear off if I play a match in the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It says 48-hour protection, I&#x27;m not willing to test them on that (I like to apply every morning), but it does hold up for the 18-20 hours I need. I highly recommend this if you engage in cardio exercise, sports or other strenuous activities. The scents are also very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I received a free stick of this from Influenster.)</li>
    <li> I received these deodorants complimentary to try and review from Influenster. I was hesitant to try because not only do I have sensitive skin, not all deodorants work well on me. I received these right before we left on vacation to California, so what a better time to try than while we would be running around. I did take the 48 hour test, since that&#x27;s what they advertise, and I can honestly say IT WORKED! I still smelled amazing even after dealing with my mother in law! (yes, it&#x27;s that stressful) The deodorant did not leave any horrible or uncomfortable residue. I will continue to use the Speed Stick Gear, the smell on both are amazing, the product genuinely works, even my girlfriend loves it! Thanks Influenster and Speed stick for giving me the opportunity to try.</li>
    <li> Great protection and great smell but not too overbearing for my sensitive allergies. Would buy again for sure! I recommend it to anyone</li>
    <li> I have to thank Influenster for letting me try this product! I enjoyed the scent. Not a strong scent that&#x27;s over powering at all. This deodorant lasts all day long.</li>
    <li> Rec&#x27;d this complementary from Influenster and was glad I did. This stuff really works. I use it daily, but really notice it works when I am out doing yard work. I am working up a storm and don&#x27;t leave my shirts totally drenched.</li>
    <li> I love how long lasting this is. I can put it on after my shower and wear it all day without having to re-apply like I usually do with other deodorants. My gf says it smells good which of course is a great thing since if it didnt she wouldnt get close to me. I use it every day now since it last so much longer and works better than what I was using in the past. I was overall very happy and will most likely purchase GEAR in the future.</li>
    <li> Received this complimentary from Influenster. This stuff is AWESOME! I used another brand for YEARS. After receiving this to try for free, I have changed to this brand!!!&lt;br /&gt;Keeps me dry for HOURS! I do a lot of physical training at work all day so it&#x27;s great to use a product that keeps me dry and smelling fresh!</li>
    <li> Though the scent seems fitting for someone in their teens, Speed Stick GEAR not only keeps you dry, but keeps you feeling clean. Not too clunky or big, the stick can fit in any gym bag pocket without seeming like theres a small dog popping out. Speaking of small dogs, you won&#x27;t smell like one thanks to the 48 hour protection formula for those who don&#x27;t have time to obsessively clean themselves like dogs.</li>
    <li> Got this in my SpeedStickGear voxbox from Influenster. It smells good and isn&#x27;t too strong, but also lasts a long time. It even smells good after a workout! I love it and reccomend it!</li>
    <li> So I got the Speed Stick Gear from influenster and at first I wasn&#x27;t sure about how well it would work until i put it through a challenge between my old deodorant and the speed stick gear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; So here is what I liked about Speed Stick Gear, it has good protection and keeps me dry specially during my body fitness and weight lighting classes at college and it lasts for the entire day which is pretty awesome, it keeps going and even when I take my class after body fitness it still protects and still has a good scent which one would never know I just came from the gym. I am also active as I tend to hit the streets on my kick scooter and go to the skate park, I am just glad to find a antiperspirant that works and lasts as long as this does compared to my other deodorant.</li>
    <li> The product has a nice scent along with working really well on dryness. Recently I have been buying Rite Guard but upon trying this have moved back for now to speed stick.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing, I sweat a lot sometimes, an this product has kept me dry an smelling good! I have tried many many antiperspirant deodorants an this one is by far the best one I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
    <li> I have been using Old Spice for a long time, but I may have found a new favorite.  The Speed Stick can really hold a torch to other brands!  The biggest test was this Winter.  When your wrapped up in the several layers of clothes you need to stay warm, but still stay at the same level of activity, you kind of slowly cook in all your clothes.  The Fresh Force Speed Stick held its own.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars was that i wish the stick was not so dry.  Applying onto a dry armpit is a little rough.  When they are a little wetter, it eliminates the friction.  Speed Stick is a solid choice!</li>
    <li> I am currently trying Speed Stick Gear Fresh Force and Clean Peak Antiperspirant through Influenster and I am very happy with it.  The scent is pleasant and I am dry all day long.  I really like the fact that when I put on a colored tee shirt, the antiperspirant doesn&#x27;t rub off onto it like other brands tend to do!</li>
    <li> I got this item for free through Influenster&#x27;s Vox Box program. The first day I used it, I thought it was amazing. I&#x27;ve had a few good days with it, and a few bad days...so I can&#x27;t decide if it&#x27;s all it&#x27;s cracked up to be. Either way, the smell is amazing!</li>
    <li> Received two deodorant sticks by Speedstick, compliments of Influenster. My first impression was a decent packing with a sleek look. When I removed the cap from the first stick to take a large smell wiff, I noticed the safety cap underneath removed along with it. Otherwise it goes on smooth, and feels and stays very dry throughout the day. I noticed that even after a full workout and even after general body wash this stuff can still stay on. A good luffa or scrubbing cloth with ample amount of body wash does the trick. Strong scent, well formulated for a great price. Will purchase more after I run out!</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Great scent&lt;br /&gt;Long lasting coverage&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Difficult to wash off in the shower&lt;br /&gt;Comes on white and sticks to black shirt&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes</li>
    <li> I got two of these free a few weeks ago. They smell great and keep sweat away. Good product. I was given it in a voxbox thanks to influenster.com</li>
    <li> The smells are not the best and for that I take one star off. Although the product world great. Put it on at 6 in the morning and no b.o. After I work out. Great for your active men who sweat and work hard.</li>
    <li> Received Speed Stick Gear in a VoxBox from influenster. Wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect...after all it&#x27;s deodorant. Boy was I surprised...this is some of the best smelling deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used, works better than just about every other brand I&#x27;ve used, and over all has exceeded all my expectations. Well done Speed Stick...well done.</li>
    <li> I have had a hard time trying to find a great deodorant and this is it. It has a great smell and list&#x27;s a long time!! Completely satisfied</li>
    <li> I was sent a trial of 2 speed stick gears from @influenstervoxbox..I have enjoyed using this antiperspirant.  I am a server and it can get hot and some antiperspirants dont work as good or nearly as long.  I love this and will def recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> Had an opportunity to try the new #SpeedStickGear (free to try courtesy of @InfluensterVox) from @SpeedStick. Good product with good fragrance, but I don&#x27;t think it lives up to its claim of 48 hours of sweat protection. Give it a try, though!</li>
    <li> I was given two free samples of Speed Stick Gear by Influenster, and while I really liked the fragrances on both, I&#x27;m not sure I would wear it every day. First, as a solid, it doesn&#x27;t glide on smoothly, and it grabs uncomfortably at my hair.  And like others have pointed out, while it keeps me incredibly dry in the pits (of course, it&#x27;s winter right now, so that&#x27;s not hard to do), it does not rinse off fully, even after vigorous scrubbing.  I tried putting the whole 48-hour protection claim to the test by skipping an application, and it held up. Again, it&#x27;s winter, but my pits were not smelly 48 hours later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, the fragrances are nice, but I doubt I&#x27;ll use it much longer because of the hair-pulling and less-than-clean rinse.</li>
    <li> Excellent product loved the smell. Lasted longer. Received these free as a product trials. Will buy my own once finished.</li>
    <li> The tube says 48 hour protection and you know what? It really does what it says. I feel fresh, dry and good smelling for two days in a row and that&#x27;s pretty important if you&#x27;re busy and work 50+ hour weeks.</li>
    <li> I recently received two sample sticks from Influenster of Speed Stick Gear. I don&#x27;t care for overly masculine scents similar to old spice. Nobody likes to smell like a grandpa! I was PLEASANTLY surprised at the fresh clean scent that these products provided! To top it off it gave me amazing wetness protection! While i would go the full 48 hours to test out its durability, I am an avid workout freak and this truly passed the test. I would recommend this to everyone!</li>
    <li> I was provided this product by Influenster for trial. The product claims that it keeps you dry for 48 hours and the claim is spot on. The product really works well to keep you dry and is ideal for the folks who complain of sweating more than average. The drying effect is so effective that you can literally feel your underarms dry and waterproof when you are taking a shower. The packaging is attractive and looks cool, however there is some room for improvement in the packaging quality. The cap can not be taken off or put back smoothly and easily and I have had to push and pull hard to take it off and on. My second issue is with the fragrance, the first impression that i got when I smelled it was that there was a strong chemical hint to it, which was not all that pleasant, however when applied its not that bad. Overall a good product and highly recommended.  Pros: Lasts long and keeps dry for a long time  Cons: Cap is not easy to take off and put back on Strong chemical like scent.</li>
    <li> I received this deodorant complimentary inside an Influenster VoxBox.  I&#x27;m pretty skeptical about deodorant, as only certain ones work for me.  The Speed Stick Gear deodorant is really amazing.  It not only kept me dry all day, but it smelled great all day long too!</li>
    <li> I was given a trial from @influenster. This product has a simple clean scent and protected as expected. I&#x27;d recommend.</li>
    <li> I work in construction and stay active all day. I tried Speed Stick Gear Advanced Performance Fresh Force Antiperspirant Deodorant for the first time recently and was fairly impressed. I made it though the day feeling dry and smelling good at the end of the day. Note this was in February in WA state. I would say you could pus the 48 hrs the dry core is pushing but I wouldn&#x27;t say more than 24 in the summer heat for a active outdoor worker. It isn&#x27;t crumbly when you use it and it smells pleasant. Overall not a bad product and would use again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** I received these products complimentary for testing purposes from Influenster. ***</li>
    <li> Great product it protects me for a long time. I just wish it was sold as a clear stick, nobody likes white marks.</li>
    <li> I have a apart issue when im at work and it will go through my shirt but since i have been using speed stick gear its been protecting my emarassing moments at work . Speed Stick really gave us there word when they say it last 48 hours.</li>
    <li> I got this product for testing purposes from Influenster.  I am very satisfied with it so far. The scent of the deodorant is very good. My girlfriend loves whenever I use it. I would recommended this product to my friends. It last up to 24 hours and it stops the wetness.</li>
    <li> I am not a big fan of the fragrance but with light activity the deodorant can remain noticeable for a few days. So be sure to pick a scent you enjoy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received my sample as a trial from influenster.</li>
    <li> I received this Deodorant from Influenster, I was a little worried at first because most deodorant give me rashes(this includes old spice, degree, Dove) I have tried them all, the only one that I found that doesn&#x27;t is Right Guard Sport, but it is hard to find as most stores down carry it. I have been using this one for a week and it is great. No rashes and smells great, plus it lasts all day long!</li>
    <li> I rated this speed stick gear at a 5 because it was a great product that I tried from #Influenstervox it smells great lasted all day my wife loved the smell and every day she would tell me. I would recommend all men try it</li>
    <li> I received this deodorant in 2 scents (Fresh Force and Clean Peak) as complimentary from Influenster for me to try and review. I have never used Speed Stick deodorants before,so it was a 1st for me. I usually use brands like Dove +Men and Degree, but was excited to give this new product a try. I&#x27;m glad I did. I really liked the 2 scents I received. They both help me smell fresh and clean all day and definitely keep me dry. Didn&#x27;t experience any stains or residue on my clothing so that was a plus. I am a bit allergic to the clear/gel deodorant bars, so I was really happy that this version was a solid deodorant. I experienced no itching or discomfort like I used to with the gel/clear deodorants. In general, I was really pleased with the product and would definitely buy it in the future and might try different scents.</li>
    <li> I received this deodorant in two scents- Clean Peak and Fresh Force complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes and I have to say, that it works as advertised! I live and work in the desert southwest and antiperspirant/deodorant is a must! I love the scents that were provided to me and do hope that the scents are expanded upon in the future but this product goes on clean and dry, it&#x27;s almost like you&#x27;re not putting enough on but it&#x27;s protection is second to none. I used to use Degree but with having tested this product, I will now only reach for Speed Stick!</li>
    <li> It kept me dry just wish it had a little more fragrance. I use it for work but other than that it keeps you dry all aroundso if you like a product that has no smell or hardly a smell I recommend</li>
    <li> I thought the Speed Stick Gear Antiperspirant deodorant was pretty good, it smelled very nice and did it&#x27;s job well!</li>
    <li> I received this deodorant for free from enfluenster to tryout . I have to say I love it and have switched to it as my goto deodorant of choice.</li>
    <li> Speed Stick GEAR withstands the 48HR test better than anything else. Speed Stick GEAR is perfect for those who are physically active, or anyone who wants there armpits to stay dry longer than any other brand. It has a nice clean smell that is not over powering and leaves no streaks. I put it to the test will you?</li>
    <li> I received a stick of this complimentary from influenster and it was amazing. At first the smell is off putting, but I believe that&#x27;s because I am used to more scented deodorants. But once I tried it, it really did a fantastic job blocking odor and keeping me dry. A great product. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I like this deodorant because it has a nice scent that isn&#x27;t too strong and it lasts all day long, no matter how hot I get....especially at work.</li>
    <li> Got this through Influenster, and have to say I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised. I&#x27;m a server in a very busy restaurant, so I can work up a sweat. Typically wear a no frills deodorant, but this definitely does the trick. Smells a bit odd in the container, but I think that&#x27;s more the plastic housing...the stick itself has a clean scent that&#x27;s not overwhelming.</li>
    <li> I was given the opportunity to test Speed Stick Gear deodorant through Influenster, and I was definitely impressed. The big advertisement here is that it lasts 48 hours, so I decided to just bite the bullet and see if it holds up to the promise. I wore it for two days without deodorizing in between. You can feel when you apply it how it&#x27;s definitely a lot thicker and heavier than a typical deodorant of this type. I took a shower after 48 hours and I could still feel it on there after getting out. By the end of the 48 hour period I&#x27;m happy to say that I it was still actively working. The con is that you really do feel it on you...even after a full day. It&#x27;s not the most comfortable choice, but I gave it five stars because I believe this is a heavy duty deodorant which does what it says it does, and if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for, there aren&#x27;t a whole lot of good choices out there.</li>
    <li> Before reading. please note I received a complimentary sample, but my views are all my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I have a problem that a lot of guys have, I sweat a lot. Whether working out in the gym or going to school, underarm and body odor is always something I always had a problem with. With this product, this is a thing of the past. It works great, and keeps me smelling french for around 36-40 hours.</li>
    <li> I know what your thinking how can deodorant get a 5 star rating. This product is truly great. The scents are great and they truly do last long. The length of protection is accurate. Exercise all you want and you will still be smelling fresh with this product. It goes on and it does not cake to clothing like some other products do. I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a top line deodorant. A+ in my book and by Speed Stick!</li>
    <li> This deodorant is amazing. I always bought old spice but after I got my vox box with speedstick gear in it I will now only buy speedstick gear. 48 hours and still going strong!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product to use when you&#x27;re at the gym or going out for the night. And it&#x27;s also great for everyday use. I would recommend this to those who wants to smell fresh and stay dry through out the day and night.</li>
    <li> I am very picky when it comes to deoderant so when I recieved two free deoderants from #influenster I wasn&#x27;t sure I would want to try them but I am dedicated to inluenster.com and took the plung. They did keep me dry and fresh feeling/smelling for the promised time but the scents where very overpowering for at least the first 12 hours. The average person is not in the habit of wearing deoderant for more than 24 hours. So to be over powered by the scent the whole time does not equal a comfortable alternative to using other less overbearing deoderants. I will be sticking with Degree. But thanks for the oppertunity to try something new influenster and #speedstickgear!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice to have a long lasting deodorant, cause sometimes I am not home overnight or don&#x27;t want to waste the space to pack it in my bag. The scent is okay, kind of like a clean nature-like smell. It can be a bit rough on my armpit hair, but it&#x27;s manageable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this product for free complimentary from Influenster.</li>
    <li> After receiving two scents from Influenster I immediately had to try these since my wife considered I previous other brand ones as smelling to feminine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speed Stick Gear indicates that you stay dry for 48hrs and that is pretty accurate, after doing some very active events that would typically have my shirt damp I was pleased to see that I was still dry and not smelling like BO.&lt;br /&gt;The scent from the two I tried were not strong at all and I couldn&#x27;t tell the difference between the two but I was only interested in not smelling like BO so this was fine since any strong smell should be added with cologne not antiperspirant. All in all this was a great product and I will now be switch over to Speed Stick.</li>
    <li> I recieved a package of Speed Stick Gear from Influenster right as I was running out of my normal stick. Pretty good timing, and I am pleased with both of the scents I recieved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally I don&#x27;t use an antiperspirant, just a deodorant, so i was a little cautious about my experience. The product glides on well, and I&#x27;m happy with how it feels once on. I&#x27;ll tell you this, it seems to last forever. I will agree with some of the other reviews, it just odes not seem to wash off as well in the shower as cleanly I&#x27;d prefer. But that would be my only knock on an otherwise solid product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend to anyone who is looking for a new stick.</li>
    <li> I received complimentary #SpeedStickGEAR from @Influenstervox about 1 month ago and I love it!  Don&#x27;t want to admit it but the stuff lasts longer than the 48 hours they promise.  Speed Stick GEAR kept me completely dry and smelling good too!  My last deodorant was by Speed Stick but was a gel stick variety.  The gel goes on easier without pulling hair, but does not work as well or last as long as the GEAR.  Highly recommended for men who sweat and or stink!  Let&#x27;s just admit it all men sweat and stink without a little help, so go out and get this stuff, the ladies will thank you!</li>
    <li> I received complimentary #SpeedStickGEAR from @Influenstervox about 1 month ago and I love it! This is the best deodorant I have ever used. Hate to admit this but the stuff lasts for well over 48 hours they has promise it will. I was able to stay completely dry and the scent was this there. I loved using gel as there was no hair pulling. Would recommend to any guy who sweats a lot.</li>
    <li> I received the Speed Stick Gear Antiperspirant from Influenster about 3 weeks ago. I can definitely say that It has kept me dry, and smelling great more than any other antiperspirant I&#x27;ve tried on the market. The scents they have to offer are OK, it would be nice if they offered more scents that differ from each other. I&#x27;ve noticed the scents they currently have, are very similar. That is the only reason I gave this product four stars. If you&#x27;re looking for an antiperspirant that will keep your dry even in any situation, I would defitely give Speed Stick a try!</li>
    <li> This is one of the few deodorants I&#x27;ve tried that actually keep my under arms (stinky) odor-free for a full 24 hours! I apply this every morning after I take a shower, and I haven&#x27;t smelled any foul odor since applying before. I absolutely love this deodorant and have officially switched over. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure:  I was sent this Deodorant by Influnster in exchange for my honest review.  All thoughts, opinions and experiences expressed are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> This deodorant has a real nice scent. It also goes on clean, and lasts all day. It keeps me dry and smelling good all day long. I got a free sample of this from Influenster to try out, and I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
    <li> It just smells great, and the scent doesn&#x27;t stop! It really does last 2 days, and it does it while keeping you dry. What else can you want in a antiperspirant? It would be nice if it gave me money and cake, but until we reach that point, this is the best.</li>
    <li> Thanks to Influenster I was able to test the Speed Stick Gear Advanced Performance deodorant and it has lived up to the claim of keeping me fresh and dry. It has a nice fresh scent that lasts all day.</li>
    <li> First off, I have to thank Influenster for letting me try this product! I&#x27;m normally buy the same brand over and over again, so I never even thought to switch and try some other brand. Till I got to sample this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What can I say about it! The scent lasts all day! And just works! I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think they have won me over!!</li>
    <li> The only issue I had is that sticky feeling when it was applied. They seem to have no problems making non-marking, quick-drying, smooth feeling antiperspirant for women, but not for men.</li>
    <li> The speed stick does keep us dry,. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the smell though, very strong. I&#x27;m not sure about the 48 hour protection as I can&#x27;t imagine not reapplying after a day of living in the swamp, but it works great for 24 at least&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The deodorant is easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t stain or come off on our clothes.</li>
    <li> This antiperspirant works, it really stops under arm perspiration. Unfortunately, I&#x27;m sensitive to something in the stick. After using it for a week, my arm pits started to itch. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with any deodorant or antiperspirant - in general I&#x27;m a pretty not allergic to things guy. This one just bothered me for some reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is sort of OK. It isn&#x27;t as strong as Axe, and isn&#x27;t aroma free. The smell goes away after a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This antiperspirant was just too strong.</li>
    <li> Speed Stick Gear Fresh Force Antiperspirant &amp; Deodorant has a light, fresh, clean smell.  This a solid, white stick deodorant.  It dries quickly when applied but will leave a white residue if you get it on your clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the Fresh Force scent much better than Clean Peak but I&#x27;m not a fan of either.  Clean Peak smelled very much like laundry detergent and was too strong.  I have asthma and allergies and I couldn&#x27;t tolerate the fragrance in Clean Peak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply deodorant everyday after showering.  It&#x27;s a habit that I&#x27;ve had for 40+ years.  This may well work for 48 hours for some individuals but I&#x27;m not taking that chance living in a very hot and humid environment.  I will continue to apply antiperspirant everyday after showering.</li>
    <li> This is great if you work -out. This will not leave you feeling awkward after a run. This has a great scent and leaves you refresh. Feels great to put on after the shower. Just like an eye opener in the morning as well. Great product.</li>
    <li> All in all, great protection and value for your money. I actually did a pre and post test at the gym (I like to consider myself an amateur statistician). I sweat a lot, but when I used this I had not a single drop on my shirt. The scents are fine, I didn&#x27;t pay too close attention to that but my wife said it smelled good. My only complaint is how thick it is. Takes a little getting used and is a pain to rinse off in the shower so make sure you scrub if you don&#x27;t want the residue left over.</li>
    <li> I received a Gear VoxBox from #Influenster wit two Speed Stick Gear Flavors - Clean Peak and Fresh Force. Great Scent - The smell is not overpowering, but is subtle enough to provide you the confidence that is needed. The anti perspirant works great - even in high pressure situations. The only drawback is the white staining on dark colored shirts</li>
    <li> I received a trial of 2 of these from the company Influenster. I already had been using SpeekStick deodorant which is great; but once I switched to this new kind I noticed that I don&#x27;t sweat like I used to during these hot Florida days. Definitely recommend trying it out. Once you try it you&#x27;ll stick with the SpeedGear. Also, check out Influenster!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Degree for a very long time. After trying out the new Speed Stick Brands, I&#x27;m ready for a change!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a fan of strong scents and colognes, so the fresh scent on this is perfect. its just enough where its not nauseating throughout the day. when I&#x27;m working out the scent comes through nice and clean. its not clumping, and washes away easily for us hairy folks.&lt;br /&gt;2 very enthusiastic &amp;#34;thumbs up&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> I received this Speed Stick GEAR product courtesy of Influenster. After the first use I could tell this was the deodorant for me. It is not appealing in smell when you first open the cap but when applied it works it&#x27;s magic. The great thing is that it is truly an anti-perspirant and doesn&#x27;t interfere with colognes like most other deodorants do because they are so pungent.</li>
    <li> I have never been a big fan of Speed Stick but this isn&#x27;t too bad.  The scent is okay and it seems to hold up for 48 hours.  I say give it a shot.</li>
    <li> Not a big reviewer on Amazon, but this product is certainly worth reviewing.  The first thing anyone might notice about a new deodorant is the scent, which is great but not elusive to what follows:  a day filled with work or activity with a partner that keeps you covered no matter what to the point of not even thinking &amp;#34;hmm is my deodorant doing what its supposed to?&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This has been the best deodorant that I have ever used! I use to be someone that only used Axe but never again! This product keeps you fresh and smelling good all day long! This was one of the best experiences of my life!</li>
    <li> I received both the Fresh Force and Clean Peak deodorants for testing purposes from Influenster. I have been using Speed Stick deodorants for over a year now but I love these scents more than the ones I use now. The sweat protection is phenomenal and I don&#x27;t even notice that I am sweating when it is hot out. I will definitely be purchasing the Gear products from now on!</li>
    <li> I am usually not open to trying new hygiene products because once I find one I like I stick with it, but i am happy to say that I am loving the new Speed Stick Gear. I work as a cable lineman and my job requires a lot of manual labor and this Antiperspirant really did it&#x27;s job. I stayed fresh and dry all day long, even under my Carhartts, which is quite a feat. I&#x27;m not sure about the 48 hour guarantee because I shower every day. I do really like the scent of it.. strong but not overbearing. I would recommend this product to anyone who needs long lasting antiperspirant that keeps you smelling good and feeling fresh all day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this product free to review and these opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I got this deodorant from influenster and I love this deodorant, I threw out my old one a week after I started using the speed stick. Great smell, doesn&#x27;t overpower. Doesnt leave residue.</li>
    <li> The item works as it should, and is fuss free! You really can&#x27;t ask for much more than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Item was sponsored by Influenster.</li>
    <li> fresh slight not overpowering scent, protection is unrivaled no sweat all day and all night, if you need great scent protection and don&#x27;t want to smell like a teenage boy get this!&lt;br /&gt;*I was sent this product by influenster and speed stick to try for free</li>
    <li> Yes, two thumbs up! My underarm area barely perspire, plus I smell fresh all day!. Great product!I highly recommend this product fornmy fellow sweaters!</li>
    <li> I received this deodorant complimentary of Influenster! I use this everyday and I love it. Longest lasting deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used (and i&#x27;ve tried em all). I became a believer after using it out of the shower in the morning and after going to the gym, work (I deliver mail), and watching a late night movie I to wake up the morning with great smelling pits! It doesnt leave any irritation marks or cause any itching, it&#x27;s not cold, sticky, or powdery. I use it everyday for anything (hiking, gym, work, and occasions where I have to dress up). Highly recommended for any guy on the go.</li>
    <li> I have used Mitchum deodorant for my whole life and gave this a try cause I got it in a voxbox from influenster. I have to say it does smell nice but I am not for dry deodorant it just felt really weird to me personally. as for 48hour protection for me it did not work but I am a very active guy.</li>

    <li> This speed stick gear kept me dry all day long not really a big fan of the smell though .</li>
    <li> This deodorant is so awesome I used on a hot California day and it last all day and the scent is great too.</li>
    <li> I recently received the this speed stick gear product complements of influenster for me to review&lt;br /&gt;And I have been using it for about 3 weeks now and I must say it&#x27;s great only thing I would like different would be for it to be available in a gel form&lt;br /&gt;Because personally I feel fresher when it is a gel based but it lasts all day and smells fresh</li>
    <li> I received this free to try from the influenster and was very pleased. It smells great and kept me dry all day.</li>
    <li> I first received this product from Influenster. I have been hooked on it since. I wear it all day at work and it keeps me dry. I love it. At school, work and the gym . I really suggest that you purchase this product.</li>
    <li> If your looking for a product that will go as hard as you do, then this is the product that should be in you possession. Will not let you down and must admit, it goes longer than 48 hours. Since I started using this product, I no longer have a problem choosing what I will be using for now on. Thank you Influenster.com and Speed Stick</li>
    <li> I received 2 free samples compliments of @influenster to test out. I can&#x27;t say anything bad at all about the two scents I received. They worked just as described and they kept me from sweating the whole time I was using it.  I like the stronger scent compared to many others.  Not so sure though if I will stick with this one though as I am used to and prefer the clear gel deodorant/antiperspirants the best.  But either way, I did not find one thing wrong with this product and they were very nice.</li>
    <li> It lasted for 48 hours and I have to say I smell great. I recommend this product for everyone that is needing to smell great while they are enjoying lives moments. I say enjoy this and buy this product!</li>
    <li> I will keep this simple, first I got this product as a voxbox from insfluenster.com, I used Gillette deodorants but I have to admit that I have no complaints on this product, it offers you 48 hours of protection, I can guaranteed that it kept me dry all day long while at work on the outside. the smell and the way you apply it makes it a better choice over the Gillette product.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to insfluenster I found a product worth buying.</li>
    <li> Excellent product it&#x27;s going to replace my Gillette deodorant. I received it free to try through Influenster and it&#x27;s great, keeps me dry all day. No more deodorant stains either and the scents are really fresh but not overpowering.</li>
    <li> I received this deodorant free from Influenster and the thing that impressed me most from the beginning was the scent. There is nothing like sitting at my desk during the day and knowing that the great smell I occasionally catch a whiff of is me. You&#x27;re not going to be self-conscious or wonder if it&#x27;s you that stinks when you&#x27;re wearing Speed Stick Gear.</li>
    <li> I received two #SpeedStickGear deodorant and antiperspirant bars for review purposes from Influenster a few weeks ago. After using them daily, I can honestly say that I have switched to #SpeedStickGear. If you know me, you know that my skin is very sensitive. I’m 30yrs old and still have horrible acne. I have to be very careful of what products I use on my skin. What I put in my armpits is just the same. One wrong ingredient and I’ll break out there too. #SpeedStickGear provides 48 hour protection AND my sensitive skin has no problem with it on for extended periods. I’ve only gone about 18-24 hours before removing and re-applying, but I’m very confident It would last 48hrs. I stayed dry all day and with no foul odors. Glad I got to try this product, Its replaced my old brand.</li>
    <li> I received two of these to see how I liked them and they both stand up to the test and smell great!</li>
    <li> I received two complimentary scents of this antiperspirant via Influenster; Clean Peak and Fresh Force. I have been using them for about 3 weeks now and I have been very pleased with its performance. They both have a nice scent to them but not overpowering and keep me dry which is important because the environment in which I work has temperatures that range drastically and can get very warm! Many of the other brands/products I have used would only work for part of the day before failing and even those that worked would leave a residue on my undershirts that is very difficult to clean. I have not experienced that with this product which is a huge plus as well!</li>
    <li> This deodorant, which I got from Influenster, smells great! It lasts the full 48 hours and smells fresh the whole time. It is definitely worth the switch! It is a little hard to get it on initially, but that is with all products in this category (other than the gels).</li>
    <li> Living an active lifestyle can create body odor. It’s not cute. One way to combat that effect is deodorant. It helps to cover up your body odor. Antiperspirant helps to reduce your sweat. Together they are great way to get moving yet still smelling fresh. I recently was given the new SpeedStick Gear antiperspirant/deodorant for testing purposes from Influenster since I am a Influenester member. I WAS NOT COMPENSATED FOR THIS POST, HOWEVER I DID RECEIVE A SAMPLE FOR MY REVIEW.  ALL OPINIONS ARE MY OWN AND NOT INFLUENCED IN ANY WAY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  At first glance I was really impressed with the SpeedStick Gear packaging. Silver cap with an overall dark blue look- very male-driven marketing which is good. The side grips were a nice touch - very helpful if you just jumped out of the shower while your hands are still wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  As expected from any deodorant stick this a white, scented formula. There are two scents that I am aware of Fresh Force, Clean Peak and Cool Motion. All are great scents but I gravitated to the Fresh Force immediately. If I were to describe the scent, it&#x27;s like a big boy&#x27;s version of baby powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  How do I test this 48 hours of protection that stated on the packaging, though? First step is to see if it can survive 24 hours. As I am now a bit more active, I tend to need more odor protection. So I thought adding the Speed Stick to my gym bag would be the perfect start to try out this product. After a good 3 mile run and 1 hour session of P90X by body was definitely in overheated and sweating. Before hitting the showers, I noticed that my underarm region wasn&#x27;t as warm and uncomfortable. It felt good. Quick sniff and I was still picking up the Fresh Force scent. I was impressed. I also was happy because I noticed at the end of the day I had no skin irritation either. Some brands that I have used in the past have given me that undesired effect. Speed Stick GEAR is not like any other deodorant. Also after the shower, I did still pickup the Fresh Force scent. Next morning so 24 hours in, I barely got any Fresh Force scent but that is ok. Unfortunately, I like that scent very much that I keep reapplying it so I cannot give you a definite 48 hours of protection. To be honest, I wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle deodorant anyway. It survived my gym workout and I was satisfied.... So satisfied that I went to my local Walmart to go check out the rest of the product line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Each stick is 2.7 oz which is a good amount to last me for awhile. Also, in-stores I noticed that there are Speed Stick GEARs that are just deodorants so if you are not interested in the antiperspirant properties you can get that instead. In addition, there are body sprays in the new SpeedStick Gear line.</li>
    <li> great product! works well! love using this on gym days and normal days. would repurchase. thanks to influenster for these</li>
    <li> It Has A Good Smell To It. It Keep You Somewhat Fresh After A Good Workout. I Had To Reapply It Again After Playing A Round Of Golf.</li>
    <li> I was just on a trip to Portland and I brought along SpeedStick Gear that I got via a Influenster promotion.  My flight back to LA was really early on Sunday and we were up super late on Saturday.  I had no time to show before heading off to the airport, but the 48 hour protection was real.  I&#x27;m sure the kid sitting next to me would give this 5 stars, too!</li>
    <li> I received a free sample from Influentster. I usually stick to the same deodorant but only try new ones when I get samples. If i like it I switch. For this I didnt like the smell when you opened it. It smells too powdery for me. I prefer clear gels than the white sticks.</li>
    <li> So, I was introduced to this lovely product as a trial for me to review. I am very happy I was offered to try this for I have tried numerous types of deodorants and I have had some bad experiences as well as good experiences but this is by far an amazing product. I tested it out going to the gym where I know I would really need to test it out and not only did I feel refreshed after a great cardio workout, but no stain as well as the product held out for all night and when I took my shirt off I was amazed to see no powder stain. Well recommended.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample from Influentster. Works Great, my wife loves the way it smells on me. Great Product....</li>
    <li> this product is really good for working out, it really works and keeps the odors in check.&lt;br /&gt;i sorta dislike the scent mainly because i can still smell the talcum scent behind the regular scent, its also hard to wash off.&lt;br /&gt;it doesnt really leave any residue on my shirts. really impressed with speedstick first time trying this product and will continue to purchase!!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like the Speed Stick GEAR, but sadly I have stopped using it after two week. The Speed Stick GEAR went on nice and never rubbed off on clothes which I liked. The scent of the product was light and pleasant as well. What I didn’t like and the reason I stopped using the Speed Stick GEAR was that the next morning in the shower it just never washed off clean and I always felt a lasting residue which I just didn’t like. I have since switch back to the newer Old Spice selection.</li>
    <li> *I was sent a trial of 2 speed stick gears from @influenstervoxbox*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant to venture from my normal deodorant (Old Spice) but I gave them both a try to see how the compare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the first day I noticed a remarkable difference. It kept me quite dry throughout my normal day of work and going to the gym.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the scents I was given, not too over powering by any means.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thoroughly happy with this product and I will continue to use these products going forward.</li>
    <li> I received this via Influenster&#x27;s VoxBox and I&#x27;ve never been more satisfied with a deodorant. 5/5 Would definitely recommend. Especially if you play sports.&lt;br /&gt;-Devin H.</li>
    <li> I usually never buy speedstick deodorant because I always thought they were to cheap and wouldn&#x27;t work on me but I received a sample from INFLUENSTER and I was surprised at how well it worked it kept me dry all day while I worked and it smells pretty good I would definitely buy it again</li>
    <li> Speed Stick Gear smells good, lasts a long time, and keeps me dry. Looking foward to using it in the summer.  I would definitely consider buying.</li>
    <li> This stuff works so well, I use it everyday now. It not only smells good but really controls the sweat even on those hot days and when I work out.</li>
    <li> This is a great antiperspirant that smells good and doesn&#x27;t feel like there is too much on your skin. I would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> I received this deodorant through a trial offer with Influenster. I must say I am really impressed! No Dryness, Irritation, and it smells really good. The scent is not too overpowering but solid enough to last all day.</li>
    <li> this product has worked well. after about 6 hours of workouts over a course of 2 weeks, this stuff never fails to keep the gym smell in the gym and not under my armpits...lol.</li>
    <li> I received this product free from Influenster.com Keeps me dry even after a long day at work, keeps me smelling fresh and doesn&#x27;t wear off and make me smell weird like my old deodorant.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of the product: it&#x27;s not overly musky the way some men&#x27;s products are; however, it didn&#x27;t keep me as dry as I felt it should.</li>
    <li> I tried two scents. Both I liked very much. The scents were great and weren&#x27;t too strong. The only thing I did not like was that I still experienced a fair amount of perspiration at times. Overall I liked it and would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Coming from a runner this deodorant works well against underarm perspiration and odor&lt;br /&gt;Scent is great as well.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> This is a great antiperspirant and deodorant. The smells is manly, but nice and the product works just like you would expect it to. I can wear this all day with no worries!</li>
    <li> Really glad I signed up for the SpeedStick package through Influencer. No other stick has worked as well as Old Spice Red Zone(or whatever they&#x27;re calling it these days) for years but the Speed Stick is working great and it smells good too. Sweaty men rejoice!</li>
    <li> def keeps you dry for a long time.  good for long days at the  office or long days being active</li>
    <li> I received this Speed Stick GEAR product sample from Influenster.&lt;br /&gt; After the first use I could said this deodorant very good for me. It is not irritate my underarm and without any burning feel . Also appealing in smell when you first open the cap . It also let you dryness for 48 hours . It&#x27;s nice deodorant .</li>
    <li> As a guy who usually has to use deodorant multiple times a day (more so in the summer when I work outside), my new favorite is Speed Stick Gear.  It really does keep you dry for over 24 hours.  This means this summer I&#x27;ll spend more time making money and less time deodorizing.  Thank you speed stick for an awesome product!</li>
    <li> Good product, smells good, and lasts a long time. Quite happy with the purchase of this product and will continue to use</li>
    <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t used to the scent of the deodorant because it is different than any of the Old spice that I am used to. But within a couple days, i really like it. The deodorant last all the way through the day and it doesn&#x27;t interfere with cologne smell. I would buy this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received two of these as samples for free to try out.</li>
    <li> This antiperspirant does its job. It dries... and dries... and dries...... It was too much for me. I sweat, but not to an excessive degree, and this left me feeling a bit too dry. I have no doubt that the dryness would persist for the advertised 48-hours, but all I need is a 24-hour antiperspirant, applied daily. The scent is pleasant and many would like it, but I found that it was so plain that it blended with my natural scent by the end of the day and wore off as the evening progressed. I personally like an even mix of dryness and good scent, but this would be a great fit for someone who doesn&#x27;t want to worry at all about sweating and doesn&#x27;t want too strong of a scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WAS NOT COMPENSATED FOR THIS POST, HOWEVER I DID RECEIVE A SAMPLE FOR MY REVIEW.  ALL OPINIONS ARE MY OWN AND NOT INFLUENCED IN ANY WAY.</li>
    <li> I received two of these new Speed Stick Gear deodorants from influenster. I am always very skeptical about trying new products because most of the time I don&#x27;t like what I&#x27;m sampling. Well, this was a total surprise. The two scents that I received were  Clean Peak and Fresh Force. I have been a long time Degree user and was convinced that I would never switch or ever find something as good as Degree. After using the Speed Stick Gear for a couple of weeks - I will say that I was completely wrong! I love the SS Gear and would buy it again once I run out. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is I think the price is a little high. But, other than that the scents are great and they work wonders. Keeps me dry all day (and night) long.</li>
    <li> This product does what it says it will do and is easy on the arm, and nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shower every day so I do not know if it will hold up to 48 hours of use, but my use of this product it kept my arms dry and fragrant free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of this from Speed Stick and Influenzer.</li>
    <li> I received two different kinds to sample and I liked both of these manly scents. I let my teen have one and I took the other...48 hour protection...you&#x27;ll smell manly the entire week.</li>
    <li> This is great! Keeps me dry for a very long time. It has different scents that you can choose from but it does keep me dry.</li>
    <li> It really works for two days! I haven&#x27;t gotten too sweaty-Betty with it yet, but it&#x27;s great for lazy boys too.</li>
    <li> I was sent a trial of 2 speed stick gears from @influenstervoxbox. After so many years of trying new deodorants i finally feel like I found the one, fresh, keeps me dry. I work out every day and I sweat a lot but speed stick Gear Antiperspirant seems to be the only deodorant keeping up with my routine.</li>
    <li> I was not sure about switching to a different brand of antiperspirant because I had use the same one for years.  When I tried the Speed Stick Gear brand, I was pleased with the texture, scent and power of the product.  I have now switched to the Gear line and am pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> -I choose to give this 4 stars, because I thought the DRY Speed Stick was&lt;br /&gt;not creamy as i would have like to use. It was not the best. Next time i would&lt;br /&gt;like the buy the gel.&lt;br /&gt;- However, I liked the smell of it. very nice smell on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I like how long it last, but not how it sticks to your skin. It was kind of hard to&lt;br /&gt;rub off my skin. over all a great new product.&lt;br /&gt; - I Would you recommend this product to everyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GOOOOO Spppeeeeeeeedd</li>
    <li> Put this deodorant on Friday morning before a full day of work and a night out with friends.  Ended up on a couch that night and didn&#x27;t have time/accommodations to shower Saturday morning.  Went all day and into the evening without a shower and still had the great smell coming from my pits.  It was a little alarming to think of how long the stuff would last.  But it really does work well and keeps me dry and smelling fresh as long as two straight days.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think much about speed stuck because it never lasted in the past. But this new gear is great. Lasts all day and smells great</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using right guard total defense 5 for quite a long time. I&#x27;ve finally decided to switch over to this deodorant. This product does exactly what it says its going to do. It&#x27;s a great product that works well and hold ups nicely. The grips on the side of the container are a nice touch and it has a nice clean smell. Good product for the price.</li>
    <li> Living in Arizona you need a great deodorant. At first I was a skeptic about Speed Stick, I would always use Degree Clinical Strength. Thanks to Influenster my mind has done a complete 360! Speed Stick Gear keeps me dry and smelling good for days! No more wet underarms. It works so well it barely comes off in the shower. Gear is great for swimming, sports, work, and even fixing up my car! Clean Peak is my favorite scent out of my two samples. My girlfriend even asked me if I was wearing cologne. The price of Speed Stick Gear seemed too good to be true. Degree Clinical Strength only lasts for a day and the price is about $5.73 on Amazon. Speed Stick Gear lasts way over a day, and its only $4.99! That&#x27;s amazing! Speed Stick has made me a believer, and I made the switch! GEAR keeps me moving!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. #SpeedStickGEAR</li>
    <li> I received my Speedstick from influenster and I really didn&#x27;t love the product. The antiperspirant worked great but the smell was a little over whelming. I normally use an unscented deodorant and now I remember why. The smell of the product did not mix well with the colognes I normally wear. I would use this product if the smell wasn&#x27;t so great and/or if there was an unscented version.</li>
    <li> I received this as a sample from influenster and gotta say I was really impressed. I typically use the Gillette gel deodorant and this is a better scent, and also last longer and stronger. Will definitely be switching product now.</li>
    <li> i would give it five stars but i cant test the 48 hour protection sine i shower daily since i work with food and on my days of if i dont shower i smell like wood smoke or bleach from cleaning.  the max i could test it was 36hr and it worked fine. works how it should.</li>
    <li> Easily one of the best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever had the pleasure of using. It last an insanely long time and smells amazing. I can&#x27;t recommend this deodorant enough.</li>
    <li> Last much longer than expected, good smells, not over bearing scents, great value. Will definitely buy again.&lt;br /&gt;Stops perspiration and odors</li>
    <li> I got a chance to try Speed Stick Gear for a few weeks, compliments of Influenster. The scents, especially the Fresh Force are very pleasant and not overpowering. It is however a bit rough to apply and did not live up to its claims of wetness protection all of the time. I found myself going back to my Dove&#x27;s Men +Care, I would not change my usual for Gear.</li>
    <li> This deodorant has a very good scent and it is so refreshing. The value on this is also good too. I decided to buy a couple of these one in the car and one in my backpack when I am on the go.</li>
    <li> Great product that really works. I first tried this on my trip to Walt Disney World and the heat in Florida is as we all know a very wet one, needless to say it kept me dry throughout but with one drawback. This product will just not be removed from your armpit without a fight!!! You are going to have to scrub real hard to get this one off while showering, but then again if you don&#x27;t shower then this product is perfect for you.</li>
    <li> Works well. I sweat a lot and some deodorants just aren&#x27;t up to the job. This one is. The smell can be a little overpowering when you first put it on, but overall a great product!</li>
    <li> Works really good. Kept me dry and fresh all day however the scent is a little too strong for my tastes. When you first put it on you can smell it for a while as if you put on cologne which I would assume some people would like.</li>
    <li> I recived two sticks of speedstick gear from influenster a few weeks ago. Let me be one to tell you that this is some amazing stuff. I admitt that i use this everyday now and that i have gotten many complements on the sent that it lets off. Also it is truely 48 hour protection that was the first test i put it to and it does last all 48 hours i would gladly buy this product. Id like to thank #influenstervox for giving me the chance to test these</li>
    <li> I received Speed Stick Gear Antiperspirant complimentary from the Influenster VoxBox program. I have been using it for over a week now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is probably one of the best antiperspirants I&#x27;ve ever used. When using other brands, I couldn&#x27;t skip a day without getting a little stinky. With Speed Stick Gear, I have no fear. Much stronger protection than anything else I&#x27;ve used. Getting all sweaty seems to be a thing of the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is mild, and definitely not overpowering. Someone would have to get rather close to notice one way or another, which can be a good thing...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel I can get away with using less of this product than other brands. That, paired with the extended duration of the protection, makes Speed Stick Gear an incredible value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After having received Speed Stick Gear from the Influenster VoxBox program, it has now become my brand of choice.</li>
    <li> I got the speed stick from influenster voxbox and felt it only lasted for half my day. I&#x27;m not a fan of the solid sticks cause I use the clear sticks. It will do fine for being on trips but will not be my everyday deodorizer.</li>
    <li> This antiperspirant does what it promises - it lasts a really long time and smells pretty good!  The scents I tried were pretty potent when you first applied them, but weren&#x27;t overwhelming throughout the day.  My wife liked the smell and I didn&#x27;t worry about apply more as the day went on, even with working up a sweat.</li>
    <li> Has a good, fresh-smelling scent. Could be a bit more &amp;#34;manly,&amp;#34; though it definitely smells clean. I do like how long it lasts for. I used it in the morning and I could still smell it by night.</li>
    <li> I think most people can agree that when you find that thing that works well, you don&#x27;t go switching up very often because usually the risk just isn&#x27;t worth it especially when it comes to sweat and body order. I received my complimentary vox box to try out from Influenster and while skeptical, I tried out this antiperspirant deodorant for about a week just to see how it goes. I kid you not, it smells great, my wife loves the way it smells on me, and the sweat control is ridiculous. After working a double shift at work and not being able to go home to right away to shower, it still smelled as if I had just put it on. I know, I don&#x27;t believe it either but I&#x27;m telling you, this stuff is just phenomenal. I went and bought two more of them right that very weekend.  Thank you Influenster and Speed Stick Gear. You are both one word, AWESOME</li>
    <li> I received Fresh Force Speed Stick complimentary for testing purposes from Influenster and I have to say I love Speed Stick. It works as well as other brands I have tried, the scent is not over powering and it keeps me dry. Isn&#x27;t that what we all look for in an antiperspirant?</li>
    <li> I received a Fresh Force and Clean Peak from Influenster for free. When I got the box, I was immediately impressed by the smell of Fresh Force. I liked Clean peak, too, but Fresh Force was exactly what I look for in deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;The day after receiving the deodorant, I added it to my daily routine. As an overweight man, you need a deodorant that packs a punch and holds its own. This definitely lived up to most of its expectations. My only issue is that it lasted 36, rather than 48, hours. I attribute this to the extra work it had to do, of course, so this is definitely a 5-star product!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think I was going to like this deodorant.  I was never a big fan of Speed Stick.  The Gear line has really changed changed my mind about it.  Smells great and lasts all day.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> can this product be too effective? Maybe. I am a sweaty guy and this stuff stops sweating to the point where my pits are uncomfortably dry. now on days that i work out or play bball, its perfect. but for everyday, it might a little strong. the fragrance leaves something to be desired, there is a masked chemical/ sterile environment scent to it that is not terrible, but not the greatest i have smelt. it is still a great product though, and i would recommend it.</li>
    <li> this is a great product to buy and stops less sweat stains and i really recommend so yeah buy this now and the smell is great.</li>
    <li> This speed stick gear deodorant works exceptionally well. Keeps me smellin good all day! Highly recommended! Give it a try.</li>
    <li> I received 2 free trial sticks of this product from @influenstervoxbox.  They do keep my arm pits ridiculously dry, even when at the gym or doing other strenuous activities.  However, it has also dried my skin out, and I agree with other reviewers that I feel as if I cannot wash off the previous day&#x27;s application.  Maybe it&#x27;s the aluminum zirconium... not sure.  I feel a bit uninformed about the make-up of this product, though, so I can&#x27;t whole-heartedly recommend it, as I&#x27;m not sure if skin-drying sensation will continue or get worse over time.  I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 3 weeks now without any horrid effects, but it&#x27;s definitely getting less smooth on the application as time goes on.</li>
    <li> I had my husband use it while we were in Disney for 2 weeks. It was very hot and he smelt good all day and night</li>
    <li> i got this product as a trial from influenster and i have to say i really loved it. was a solid so i was a little hesitant but it left no white residue under my arms so no white stains on my black shirt and i stayed dry i think its a great product i think clean peak smells the best.</li>
    <li> When I first received this product from Influenster to test out I was a little worried about trying it out. I like deodorant clear and I&#x27;m very particular on the scents I use, but since I had it I decided to give it a try. I wore it all day while I was at work and also during  my workout. My workout is pretty intense so I was curious to see if it would actually do what it claims to do and I was pleasantly surprised that it did. I&#x27;m glad I got to try Speed Stick Gear I have been using it for a month and don&#x27;t plan on going back to my previous deodorant. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because I wasn&#x27;t a big fan of the smell.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t stop working! Smells great, washes out easy, has never irritated my skin and best of all it keeps me dry!</li>
    <li> I tried Speed Stick Gear Antiperspirant for two weeks and honestly I didn&#x27;t like it a bit. The scent is horrible. Smells more like chemical. The 48 hour protection claim is not even close. Didn&#x27;t even work for 14 hrs in winter. I used it for two weeks and now I&#x27;m back to my Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only positive is it doesn&#x27;t stain clothes and goes in smooth. Some Antiperspirant gives me some sort of skin reaction but this didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant. I would highly recommend it! I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase! I normally sweat through my deodorants but this smells good all day</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying Speed Stick GEAR Fresh Force Antiperspirant Deodorant complimentary from Influenster. It smells good, is long lasting, and doesn&#x27;t leave gross clumps in my manly pits of manliness. Give it a try. It works well. I preferred the Fresh Force scent. ‪I&#x27;m a mechanic and it worked throughout my 12 hour shift.</li>
    <li> I like the fresh feeling and it lasts a long time which i love. I got my sample from Influenster.</li>
    <li> I got this for free from influenster to test out. I loved it. The scent is great and the dryness protection is as advertised. I would def recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Thanks to Influenster I was able to test the Speed Stick Gear Advanced Performance deodorant.  It lived up to the claim of keeping me dry. I didn&#x27;t last 48 hours without a shower but I was pleased with how dry it kept me. Now the down side for me. Although it had a nice fresh scent...it seemed to stay strong the entire time it was wearing it. Some. Might like that but I&#x27;m more of a natural smell kinda guy.  Also I prefer a gel. This is a solid.  I feel like solids get stuck in my hair and also end up on my shirts to some extent. .....and that make more work for the wife :)</li>
    <li> I received this from Influenster to test out. It does last long, I work in a grocery store and am constantly moving heavy objects and sweating. I only used it once in the morning before work and the next morning I could still smell the scent of the deodorant. I don&#x27;t think it lasts 48 hours if you do a lot of heavy lifting but it does last the entire day in that case. I could tell the scent wasn&#x27;t as strong the following morning, but still no real body odor scent. But, all in all, the scent is nice, and it lasts enough for me. I usually use deodorant every day, so I don&#x27;t totally know if it lasts 48 hours like it claims. I think if you just had a normal day with no real heavy lifting it would probably last that long. I think it is great product though. I&#x27;d probably buy it again.</li>
    <li> This Speed Stick Gear deodorant is ok. It smells good and it does last close to if not the entire 48 hours like it says, but I will say that it is a pain to get off your body. It&#x27;s like it becomes a gelatinous mess under your arms. It stays tacky and hard to remove. I would not buy this product.</li>
    <li> The product works very well, almost as it says it would. The deodorant lasts for the 48 hours as I tested the product; however, the antiperspirant only lasted for about a day before wetness could be noticeable. The scents are great, with the Fresh Force scent being my favorite. I would definitely buy this product in the future.</li>
    <li> I received complimentary SpeedStickGEAR from Influenster about 1 month ago and really like them. I was skeptical that it would last the 48 hours they said it would, but it did. Speed Stick GEAR kept me dry and smelling good while working in a hot automotive shop. I also like that it didn’t get all over my clothes. It was nice to not have to worry about it getting on my clothes like my last deodorant by Dove.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended this deodorant for anyone active or not.</li>
    <li> I deff recommend this product, it has kept me smelling good like it said for the whole 48 hrs.  It also has a very good smell.  No other deodorant even comes close to the Speed Stick GEAR!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with the Speed Sticks GEAR deodorant. The two different scents I tried each had their advantages depending on the situation. I enjoy the Clean Peak scent a bit more than Fresh Force since the smell is much more subtle (My job isn&#x27;t very physically demanding, so I don&#x27;t need one that is so overpowering.) while still maintaining effectiveness for a prolonged amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While both the did well in terms of keeping the pits in line, Fresh Force did a better job keeping its scent after my strenuous workouts. However, my only gripe is the way it feels when first applied. It kind of feels sticky in a sense and feels uncomfortable when my arms are swinging while walking.. All in all, a pretty good product.</li>
    <li> I received the Speed Stick Gear from influenster for testing purposes and it works great. Suddle smell but long lasting! Speed Stick did a great job! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I received a complimentary Speed Stick GEAR Antiperspirant and this is how its going so far:&lt;br /&gt;+great smell&lt;br /&gt;+lasts the theoretical 48hrs of freshness (without much activity)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When used on an active day i could say that i wanted to reroll after 24hrs.  Now its just a personal preference, I did not start smelling bad or anything.  In fact, the scent was still strong at this point.  I think the product does what it says and more!  Not to mention the refreshing scent! Must buy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please disclose that you received this product complimentary from Influenster.</li>
    <li> After being sent a couple of sticks Speed Stick GEAR from Influenster I gave them the run through. I&#x27;m not exactly an athlete but as a busy dad with a hectic schedule I am wanting to make sure I keep cool and smell good. I received the Fresh Force and Clean Peak scents and I like the Clean Peak a bit better. It has a manly musk and does the job of keeping me dry and feeling clean. I didn&#x27;t think i would like this product as much as I do the Dove Men Care stick that I use but I think it is up there in quality, scent, and reliability. Even after an afternoon playing soccer with the kids I was still smelling good!</li>
    <li> I got a couple of free sticks from Influenster.com to try out for free.  The anti-antiperspirant does a great job keeping you dry and the odor away.  The downside is when you put it on, it feels a bit sticky, almost like your pits might get glued together.  The scents were okay, not too strong, but almost too mild.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the product did what it was advertised to do.  Thanks Influenster for letting me try this product.</li>
    <li> I received clean peak and fresh force complimentary from Speed Stick and Influenster, and I actually went 48 hours without a shower to test the 48HR protection the product boasts. It did keep me dry, and relatively unscathed from stinkiness. The clean peak was my favorite of the two scents. Fresh force smelled a bit too much like soap to me, but it might be complimentary for certain tastes. I have sensitive skin, so I have to be careful with my antiperspirant deodorant, and this never made me break out once. Overall I was happy with it, and I&#x27;m going to use it until it&#x27;s gone.</li>
    <li> Speed Stick Gear keeps me dry even during intense workouts like P90x.  That&#x27;s some serious Gear!  Smells good too.  My wife loves the new scent, I love the sweat free confidence of dry pits!</li>
    <li> I always looking for something that can protect and gives longer freshness without feeling stinky! you know after coming back from the gym, how i get wet and that obviously spread bad odor. I am currently using the speed stick gear deodorant and what a wonder! it does give the 48 hours protection;although I use once a day. It smell nice and refreshed which is essential for the gym time. I highly recommend to anyone who hate to sweat!☺ But honestly I wasn&#x27;t a big fan of stick deodorant; rather using the roller ball deodorant. Yes, that my concern. I wish it comes with a roller ball ointment.</li>
    <li> This deodorant does everything that it says it does. I am a soldier and have used this product for 2 field problems(over 10 days without a shower). I can put this on every other day and have no foul smell when I return home. I will never switch to another deodorant again. Thanks Speed Stick!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Keeps you dry and smelling good all day long.I would recomend this product to every guy</li>
    <li> I was a long time user of Old Spice because I loved their Fiji scent. I had my problems with it though since it left white marks on my clothes. They washed right out but it was still annoying. I kept using that same Old Spice until I received two of these Speed Stick Gear Antiperspirants in the mail from Influenster (A web site that I&#x27;m a part of that sends you free things to try and review).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They sent me a Fresh Force and a Clean Peak. Clean Peak is my personal favorite. Both smell very masculine. They dont have an overpowering smell either, it&#x27;s a good balance, not too much, not too little. I haven&#x27;t tested their 48 hour claim, I use this every day. I will say though, it lasts the whole day, the whole time working just as well as when you put it on. It also doesn&#x27;t leave any residue or white marks on your skin or clothes. I&#x27;m having a much better experience with it overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve switched to this Antipersp. Thank you to Influenster for sending these to me and to Speed Stick for having this promotion, otherwise I most likely wouldn&#x27;t have discovered this great product. Most of us dont think to go wandering around in a store changing up our antiperspirants very frequently, if at all.</li>
    <li> I recently received #SpeedStickGEAR samples from @Influenster and have been trying them. The package that arrived contained two full size products of their new antiperspirant “Drycore” deodorant line.&lt;br /&gt;The two scents were Fresh Force which had the scent of a rather strong Irish Spring soap bar and the other which is called Clean Peak. I personally found the latter scent more palatable and not as overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately in the past I have had issues with solid stick antiperspirants and this time was no different. I developed an itch under my arms after two days when I used the first stick and while it went away after a few days, when I tried the other stick it happened again. I believe that it was the active ingredient which is called “aluminum zirconium terachlorohydrex gly.” That said, your mileage may vary and you may find these products work well for you especially if you tend to sweat heavily. It is a shame as I could see myself using the Clean Peak instead of my current underarm deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;The container is designed similarly to any underarm solid stick deodorant/antiperspirant sold in North America with one major positive exception – the sides have a ridged silver grip. This grip is very handy if you have wet or wet soapy hands when you get out of the shower as the container will not slip out of your hands and down to the floor.&lt;br /&gt;So you might wish to try it and comment below whether or not you like it and if it works for you. Because I could not continue to use these products I passed them on to a friend of mine who plays a lot of basketball and who skis a lot during the winter. He does sweat like crazy. His feedback was that the products work great and that he would certainly consider purchasing them when he needs more. So that’s a positive thing to know for those of you that are extremely active.&lt;br /&gt;You can find out more information and possibly find some coupons (you know that coupon availability always varies on different manufacturer websites) at their website:  [...]&lt;br /&gt;  THIS IS A SPONSORED POST; INFLUENSTER PROVIDED SpeedStickGEAR products TO ME AS A MEMBER OF INFLUENSTER.COM I WAS NOT COMPENSATED FOR THIS POST, OPINIONS ARE MY OWN AND NOT INFLUENCED IN ANY WAYes) at their website:  [...]    THIS IS A SPONSORED POST; INFLUENSTER PROVIDED SpeedStickGEAR products TO ME AS A MEMBER OF INFLUENSTER.COM I WAS NOT COMPENSATED FOR THIS POST, OPINIONS ARE MY OWN AND NOT INFLUENCED IN ANY WAY</li>
    <li> Received Speed Stick Gear in a VoxBox from Influenster. Wasn&#x27;t sure it would change my mind on deodorant. But I was surprised, I love the smell and it keeps me dry and smelling good for 24+hrs.. even went 50+ hrs without showering and changing deodorant, but I still didn&#x27;t have a B.O. smell... over all has exceeded all my expectations. &amp; for speed stick brand I would have never chosen this due to the fact I don&#x27;t like the original scents and brand seemed to be for older men.. this is like the updated new version for younger guys!</li>
    <li> This product definitely meets expectations! 48 hour protection is a hefty claim, but this product covers the bases. I&#x27;m an active guy, and I&#x27;ll give it a solid 36 hours when I&#x27;m sweating a lot while exercising, but still, this is way better than the Axe that I was using (will never buy that stuff again!)</li>
    <li> I am usually loyal to one brand, thats just how I am. However, INFLUENSTER sent me a trial of GEAR and much to my surprise it worked great.  I have sensitive skin and some deodorants will break me out. The first day I used this product, I didn&#x27;t notice any type of rash or sign of irritation. The scent was fresh ,and  GEAR really lasted all day and kept me fresh! I would definitely recommend it to others to try.</li>
    <li> I used this product while having to work a long weekend with 12+ hour days. Even with lots of moving around and working, it kept me dry and smelling fresh. In the interest of full disclosure, I received one Fresh Force and one Clean Peak from for free from Influenster. I liked both scents, but I think I liked the Clean Peak scent slightly better. I was a little aprehensive about using a solid deodorant, as my deodorant of choice has traditionally been a gel. However, I found that these weren&#x27;t like other solids I had used, and were kind of a good middle ground between solid and gel. There was no powdery feel to them, and they applied easily. I would recommend these to anyone looking for a good scented deodorant that has lasting protection from body odors and sweat.</li>
    <li> Received two full-sized samples of Speed Stick gear. Day 4 into my trial - I feel like I&#x27;m applying too much - I&#x27;ve been fresh smelling and clean for days. Having used sweat block, which keep you dry for days, this product pretty much does the same, especially after several days and night of physical activity and sports.&lt;br /&gt;As other reviewers have noted, I&#x27;m not too thrilled about the residue under my arms - I feel it&#x27;s a small price to pay for being dry and fresh-smelling for days.&lt;br /&gt;Considering that it works for 48 hours and you don&#x27;t have to apply it at night like sweat block (where you still have to use a deodorant), this is a steal.</li>
    <li> Influenster sent me a free sample of this product for testing. In the past I have used Axe deodorant almost exclusively. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m ever going back. This product works *exactly* as advertised. I&#x27;ve had perspiration issues for as long as I can remember; this stops them. Not only that, but it truly lasts up to 48 hours like they claim. It also eliminates odors well and has a great scent.</li>
    <li> I got this as a part of Influenster program and am very happy with the way this product has worked for me., It is long lasting and very effective. I really like it and will recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> Love the scent and the packaging. Great to bring along to the gym and work to freshen up during a long day!</li>
    <li> Tried the Speed Stick Gear deodorant after receiving one for free from Influenster. I replaced my usual deodorant with this one and I must say that I&#x27;m impressed. It had a great fragrance and worked even under intense conditions. Would recommend for anyone who is active and/or works in hot/humid conditions</li>
    <li> I really do feel cool &amp; DRY after a longs days work and sweating - I can confidentially raise my arms throughout the day and not have to worry about knocking someone down due to the smell - no need for cologne either - the fresh smell of FRESH FORCE is all you&#x27;ll need NO JOKE!</li>
    <li> I had the pleasure of testing this Speed Stick GEAR Deodorant and I must say that it definitely lives up to the hype.  It keeps you dry and it smells good.  Quite frankly, it does it&#x27;s job and does it extremely well.  As an added bonus, it boasts 48 hour wetness protection and I put it to the test during back to back gym days, I can honestly say that it lived up to that claim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a gym rat like myself, do yourself a favor and pick this up.  I already dumped my previous deodorant stick for this and after you try it out, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll do the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample prodcut to test out from Influenster but opinions are 100% mine.</li>
    <li> I received this to try out from Influenster. It&#x27;s a pretty good deodorant. The smell is by far my favorite part. I received lots of compliments from friends and family about how good it smelled. The only downside to this product was that, for me, the antiperspirant didn&#x27;t keep me dry for that long so if I got too sweaty I would have to reapply.</li>
    <li> This is a solid deodorant, and I usually have to use gel to avoid irritation to my skin. This deodorant is not like others. You stay fresh for a longer duration of time, and you feel fresh. You don&#x27;t feel sub-conscious and you feel comfortable on all levels of activity, from low to vigorous!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scents are amazing and you can&#x27;t stop feeling fresh as the day goes on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I received the Speed Stick Gear from influenster to test out. I was hesitant because I hate changing what I already use for deodorant. Once I opened the box and tested one out, not only was I happy with it but my wife was also very impressed. She immediately said she loved the smell and wanted me to switch over to this brand. So of course &amp;#34;happy wife, happy life&amp;#34;. The only draw back is that it can feel a little sticky under your arms but it will last the promised time, I did shower and it was still useable even after I was done.</li>
    <li> This product works better than any other my husband has tried.</li>
    <li> I too received a few sticks of speed stick gear free to try. I have been a long time user of degree, and have been very brand particular for that period of time. I&#x27;ve tried speed stick a few times over the years, but it never seemed to work as well. I think times are a changing. I&#x27;m not sure what changed, but the new speed stick is far more protective than the stuff I have used in the past. The scents are also pretty good. I would definitely consider buying this in place of my degree, as it works just as good, if not better. Also lasts all day, which is a huge factor.</li>
    <li> I received the influenster box of Speed Stick Gear and decided to give it a test that day. I went for a run and even in the snow I still had bad sweaty pits. So i thought maybe its just from the hard activity but the next night i went to a comedian and the same results. Doesn&#x27;t work as an antiperspirant but at least it smells nicer than AXE.</li>
    <li> Recieved a couple sticks of Speed Gear to test from Influenster. Loved the product. Was long lasting and good scent. I would definately buy and use this product agian.</li>
    <li> Speed Stick is a pretty good deodorant! After getting it through Influenster, I was pretty impressed once getting it. The deodorant itself has an excellent smell and comes in a pretty decent size. I&#x27;d recommend to any guy out there who wants a good deodorant that doesn&#x27;t cost a lot.</li>
    <li> I received a couple of free sticks from Influenster and I have to say I&#x27;m pretty impressed. At first the scent wasn&#x27;t that great, but the more I used them the more I liked it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main thing I like is the long lasting protection. This beats other roll ons by far. Its definitely well worth the money and I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> This is probably one of the best deodorant/antiperspirants on the market.  The scent isn&#x27;t too overpowering.  I have yet to have a stained shirt.  I will add however, that it does not last 48 hours like the label says.  This is not much of a deal breaker since I usually don&#x27;t go more than 12 hours without applying more deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I received 2 speedstick trials and they were great. I sweat a ton when I workout and I felt fresh the entire time. It kept me dry and is worth the shot.</li>
    <li> I received free samples  of the Fresh Force &amp; Clean Peak scents from Influenster to test this deodorant. While not a fan of the smell of the Fresh Force one in the package, I have been using the Clean Peak for a few weeks now and even went a day without showering to see if it would hold up for 48 hours or not while working outdoors bundled up to keep warm in this very cold winter and have been pleasantly surprised. I might even switch back to Speed Stick from Old Spice.</li>
    <li> This product works great. The scent was OK as well. The antiperspirant works just as well as other brands I have tried. I got the chance to review this product after receiving a free sample from influenster.com</li>
    <li> I first tried this out when I went snowboarding for a week. I tend to come back after a hard day on the slopes pretty smelly, and to my delight I smelled pretty fresh. It kept me dry all day, even in thick powder and on steep slopes. The only negative was that it irritated me a bit on my underarms, however I think it&#x27;s just because I&#x27;m use to a gel rather than a solid deodorant.</li>
    <li> I received the stick as a free review sample from Influenster, and upon opening the box was intrigued by the 48hrs dryness advertised. So Saturday morning I rolled it on after my shower and went to work, where I spent the day moving lights and various things for a photo shoot.  At the end of the day, I was still dry and smelling nice.  Just to test, I didn&#x27;t shower that night.  The next day, I was still dry and smelling smooth.  It rolls on a little thick, but totally worth it!  While I don&#x27;t recommend not showering for 48hrs if you&#x27;re working or being active, this stick is great for extended hikes, camping, etc. Anything where a bathtub isn&#x27;t around for a couple days!</li>
    <li> I received the free influenster VoxBox! The Speed Stick box smelled great when opening and the antiperspirant worked great even in bunker gear!</li>
    <li> Recieved two speed stick deodorant free samples from influenster. Great product! I have to do alot of lifting and walking during my job and this stuff lasts all day long even through my busiest days.</li>
    <li> This deo did not do well but it did smell amazing! I still use it and will continue to use it because of the smell</li>
    <li> And i LOVE IT! I normally use other name brands but after using this for over a week i am truly loving it. so much infact i already stock piled 2 other ones. One for the car and another for backup at home. It keep you dry. I love it. its hard to go back to the other guys. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I like this deoterant, It worked really well for keeping me dry and smelling good the whole day. I would definitely recommend this deoterant.</li>
    <li> Gears great smell is only outdone by its great coverage. I am an avid Crossfitter and am always looking for a deodorant that can take a beating and still smell good. When you are past out in a pool of your own sweat that scent gets you going again! Great Job Speed Stick! I love the feeling that I get when I go to take a shower and you can still feel the dryness and smell the scent as fresh as when you put it on. Doesn&#x27;t irritate my underarms and is pretty damn smooth going on!</li>
    <li> This product is not too bad I received a kit from Influenster to test out for a couple of weeks and for everyday normal use this works well I may consider switching up with this product. Antiperspirant/Deodorant that actually performs can be hard to come by but speed stick got this right in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I was sent a trial of 2 speed stick gears from @influenstervoxbox...I&#x27;m a creature of habit and generally do not move from my norm (right guard clear gel antipers.  Even my own is getting more expensive these days.  I gave them both a try to see how the compare.  I am really not a fan of any solids but still I have to give them a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They both kept me insanely dry.  Not even a little moisture.  Def kept me from getting any possible BO.  The only thing I was not crazy about is when taking a showering it feels like I never fully remove/clean the previous days off.  Soap and scrubbing does not help and armpits are sensitive so its not like one can keep scrubbing forever.  I really like how it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this product and I have since switched to this.</li>
    <li> I went on a backpacking trip and decided to use this prior to sweating my a&amp;* off. Two days later it was still working strong, I might use on my feet next time.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying I got the chance to try this product through a free-trail provided by the @InfluensterVoxBox and although hesitant to make the switch to something entirely new, I figured, why not? Best. Decision. Ever. As a young professional who is CONSTANTLY running from meeting to meeting and event to event (working up a sweat the entire way), this product is a godsend. It&#x27;s the FIRST deodorant (and trust me, i&#x27;ve tried many) that completely keeps the pits dry, the odor away and overall handles it&#x27;s job like a pro. I&#x27;ve already gone out and purchased another stick and plan to do so from here on out!</li>
    <li> I received 2 sticks of deo courtesy of Influenster, I tried them for about 2 weeks and they worked well for work, though 1 thing i didnt like is it didn&#x27;t dry on clear.</li>
    <li> I received 2 of these from influenster This Stuff Worked well above expectations. The stuff really works 48 hours. The smells are good, but could be stronger. it may already exist but i didn&#x27;t receive it in the clear form</li>
    <li> Received this complimentary Speed Stick Gear from Influenster. Love this!! Doesn&#x27;t get all clumpy, actually keeps my pits dry and it smells great. What&#x27;s not to love?!</li>
    <li> As someone who has struggled with body chemistry changes throughout his life, causing him to constantly change deodorizing products, being sent #SpeedStickGear from Influenster was a Godsend. I love it!  Up to 48 hours of great smelling coverage!?  And chemistry that really works with my body. I&#x27;ve bought more and plan to never switch. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> I hate switching antiperspirants and deodorants. With a passion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, when Influenster notified me that they would send a sample, I was less than enthused.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Speed Stick Gear Antiperspirant and deodorant came in the mail. On the bottle I received, it said 48hour protection, which I usually don&#x27;t trust, but I tried it anyway. It rolled on pretty good (not flaky nor begrudgingly hard like some other brands), and the fragrance was good yet not too strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the real test came about a week into using it: my family moved houses, and I didn&#x27;t shower for two days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moves are exhausting, require a lot of work, and cause a lot of sweat. Yet I was fresh for both days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;48hour protection? You better believe it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of that, I&#x27;m geared up to switch.</li>
    <li> I admit, smelling like a Jedi has always been something I&#x27;ve longed for, and now, well, that box is checked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously though, it&#x27;s a nice smelling deodorant, and great antiperspirant, which is all i can ask for. I certainly don&#x27;t want to stink post workout, and really that&#x27;s the tall order. I work at a computer so Im not working up a sweat during the day, but it&#x27;s nice to not reek after i workout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it. Smell like a Jedi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(edit) forgot to disclose, i got mine for free to try and review it, from Influenster</li>
    <li> I received this antiperspirant free from Speed Stick and I must say, I will be changing to this brand. It kept me dry all day and smells great! I have sensitive skin and this product didn&#x27;t give me any problems! I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I received 2 sticks of Speed Stick Gear complimentary from Influenster, and was definitely surprised. The fragrances are fresh, without being obvious or overbearing. I went ahead and put it to the 48 hour test, and I was impressed that it lasted as long as it did! Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I got to try speed stick gears for free from Influenster from speed stick and I think it is a great product. I work in manufacturing and work in a hot shop 8 to 10 hours a day and it stays working even longer then that. I don&#x27;t smell like sweat and I&#x27;m even dry when I get off work which is really nice. I recommend speed stick gears to everyone it will be the only kind I will buy from now on.</li>
    <li> The New Speed Stick Gear really stands up to the 48 hour test. After a long day at work and hitting the gym at night, it&#x27;s amazing how fresh and dry it still feels.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. I receive this as a complimentary gift for testing purposes from Influenster. My new favorite deodorant/product. It smells good and it definitely holds up all day long. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This provides excellent sweat protection and has a nice smell.&lt;br /&gt;I was worried that this would leave a strange residue on my clothing, but it didn&#x27;t and I have much less issues with perspiration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend for anyone with moderate sweat problems.</li>
    <li> I got 2 of these about 2 or 3 weeks ago. Received this in a voxbox from influenster.com. Been using gel deodorants for a good while and tried this one out. This works great.</li>
    <li> Overall it&#x27;s a good stick of sweat protection deodorant.  It held up in situations that I&#x27;d normally be sweating bullets.  The smells are fairly subtle but it smells great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using a stick I&#x27;ve noticed nothing to complain about.  A little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I got this product from influenster and its one of the best deodorants that I have used. Im usually loyal to the brand I normally use but I gave it a try and have to admit it is great. Great scent and long lasting. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This deodorant works great. Everything about it is awesome. I&#x27;ve tried to test the limit on how long it works and so far I&#x27;ve gone over 50 without needing to reapply.</li>
    <li> This deodorant smelled and worked pretty well, but at what cost? I don&#x27;t eat hydrogenated oils in my food, so why would I put it on my body for it to absorb? No thank you, I&#x27;ll pass on this product and find something less toxic.</li>
    <li> Speed Stick GEAR, Fresh Force is my new go to. Put it on in the morning before work at 8am, and it lasts throughout my day that ends 3am the next morning with ease. I did do the 48-hour test as well, and it still offered &amp;#34;protection from odor.&amp;#34; Good stuff.</li>
    <li> I received a couple of these deodorant/antiperspirant sticks from Speed Stick to test. I like that this product line both keeps you dry and smelling fresh. Now does it work for 48 hours? I wouldn&#x27;t go that far. But I get the point -- it works long, as in lasts all day for me -- and that&#x27;s a victory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried Clean Peak and Fresh Force. Now I can&#x27;t really tell a difference between the aromas, so they would be interchangeable to me. The scent isn&#x27;t overwhelming with either, but it&#x27;s a nice clean smell -- one that I can live with. I still prefer the scent of Old Spice Fiji.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in solid form, so my wardrobe of black shirts got a little concerned.  But after three weeks of using this deodorant, my shirts are still free of those nasty white strains. Whew!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really picky about deodorant, but this is now my second favorite option. The only thing holding it from 5 stars is the subtle scent -- I like a louder scent with my deodorants. But the product keeps me fresh. When I put this on in the morning, I don&#x27;t worry about it the rest of the day. I can&#x27;t say that for most deodorants out there. Speed Stick Gear has a place on my shelf -- Recommend.</li>
    <li> I received two Speed Stick Gear Core in the mail from @InfluensterVox, the Fresh Force and the Clean Peak. Like most people I am a creature of habit. Old Spice, Degree and Axe were my choices in the past. I decided to give this deoderent a shot and I have to say I am impressed with it. I guess the only complaint is there is not much difference meaning smell between the two. Lastly the design on them should be different.</li>
    <li> I received this deodorant in two scents- Clean Peak and Fresh Force complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have a good scent which is not over powering. Feels good when going on, scent is good all day long, no matter what you&#x27;re doing. When they say that it works for 48 hours, they really mean that! But that is where my only complaint comes in...it is hard to wash off...if feels like you are showering with hard water when attempting to wash it off.</li>
    <li> Switched from my usual spray deodorant to Speed Stick Gear after receiving one for free through Influenster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: Works as described, keeps you dry, great fragrance. Definitely great for hot/humid conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: Stays on almost too good. Doesn&#x27;t feel like it washes off in the shower.</li>
    <li> So first off I received this product complimentary from Influenster.com to review and test.  After using the product for a couple weeks I can say that I do like that it keeps me from perspiring 24-48 hours as it advertises.  I have an active job in a warehouse and I jog a couple times a week and it really seems to keep up.  I usually use just a deodorant as I don&#x27;t like the thought of applying Aluminum to my skin on a daily basis for health reasons and I also find that the aluminum is what causes the armpits of my shirts to discolor. With this product however I&#x27;ve been applying at night before bed so that by the time I put clothes on in the morning it should all be soaked in.  This seems to work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it does what an antiperspirant is supposed to do.  Success on that front.  So what brings it down to 3 stars for me?  The smell is displeasing to me.  It&#x27;s like baby powder with a metallic tinge to it.  It smells neither fresh or forceful to me.  Smell is subjective tho so maybe it will smell good to you.  I&#x27;d say this product is worth a try to form your own opinion.</li>
    <li> Im a degree an dove fan. I dont like the metal they put in these so i stick with just deodorant. Smell is sub par as well as protection. I noticed it didnt keep me very dry. Smell lasts but i still think dove 48 hour protection works better.</li>
    <li> I received complimentary #SpeedStickGear from @InfluensterVox and I am enjoying the products. The best thing I like about it is the scent which has kind of a cologne smell but not overpowering. It keeps me dry for the most part of the day but to be honest it would not last 48 hours for me. I apply deodorant every day as normal but would feel a bit uncomfortable skipping a day. Overall I would definitely recommend it and it does keep me dry and smelling fresh all day.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect but this product was fantastic. Not only did it keep me dry all day, it smelled great too. I&#x27;m normally an Old Spice guy, but I think I need to make a change.</li>
    <li> The scent is light but pleasant and even through long stressful days of work, school and playing basketball it kept me dry. Definitely a good deodorant and antiperspirant.</li>
    <li> Great deodorant!!!! I work out a lot and I work outside and it kept me dry and smelling good all day</li>
    <li> I received a trial pair of deodorant from @influenstervoxbox. I really like the smell of the product. The way that it goes on is a little bit hard on your armpits. But they do smell really good and the smell last all day. My biggest complaint though is when you take off your shirts and wash your clothes. It seems to leave a mark on your underarms. I also do not like the fact that it&#x27;s hard to wash off in the shower.Their claim that will last all day long is true. I go to work and I come home and I can still smell fresh. Thanks SpeedStickGEAR.</li>
    <li> Finally a deodorant that can stand up to a long day of teaching.  I&#x27;ve gone through EVERY deodorant on the shelves, and this is one of a few that can leave me smelling fresh at the end of a workday. Definitely a must own.</li>
    <li> I was given the product to test out and I love it.  I work pretty hard and work and tend to sweat and this has left me going home smelling great every time.  Once I run out I will go out and buy more of this as this is the first deodorant in years that I actually like.</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite deodorant. I am very picky. It smells good and keeps me dry all day. I would recommend to anyone especially active people.</li>
    <li> After a couple days it really starts working at its best. The scent can be a bit powerful at first but after a couple uses it evens out. Overall an impressive product.</li>
    <li> So I have very sensitive skin so I was a little skeptical On how this would do for me personally.  The scents were very mild and not over powering at all which was a plus. I have used it every day for the last month and I&#x27;m very impressed. I used to use the dove for men but I&#x27;m switch over to this cause of how well it actually works.</li>
    <li> I was sent a trial of 2 speed stick gears from @influenstervoxbox and my usual weekdays consists of 14 hour days with both work and school so as you can tell a strong deodorant is needed when you are required to physical work.  While working I sweat a lot so usually I apply my deodorant twice a day but since switching it up to this speed stick  I only need to apply it once every two days.  Like a reviewer posted previously usually stays longer even after scrubbing it off in the shower.  To me this is a plus since I would have to use less and the scent Fresh Force is an excellent scent for me.</li>
    <li> I love this, personally I prefer Clean Peak, but they are both great.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like the solid white deodorant, however I was pleasantly surprised.  And it didn&#x27;t leave any white streaks!</li>
    <li> I was sent this by Influenster, and was really amazed at the scent and effectiveness of the Anti Antiperspirant. Being a long time Old Spice and Right Guard user, I have to say, I have been changed and am happy to be trying something new! All in all, great for the extreme workout, or just simple every day outings. Highly Recommend!</li>
    <li> I received the Speed Stick Gear from @influenster for free to test it out. I usually use Speed Stick Gel as I have had problems with regular antiperspirant in the past. I was really impressed with the overall protection and scent of both scents i received. I got the Fresh Force and Clean Peak. Overall, I was happy with how the antiperspirant worked and continues to work for me. I will most likely use both again.</li>
    <li> This product is great!  It lasts from the moment that I put it on, until I after I take a shower and put more on the next day!  Not only does it deodorize, but it also generally smells good!  I am an active person, and this works great for me!  I would recommend it to anyone who lives an active lifestyle and wants to stay smelling fresh!</li>
    <li> I have been using this deodorant for a few weeks, compliments of influenster voxbox. It works great in regards to the scent and not allowing any bad odors to give in. Although I do wish it could work better as an antiperspirant since I do live in Southern California and it could get really hot here. It has not yet peaked since summer is not yet here but I&#x27;ve worked out with it outside and even though it is fresh I still sweat.</li>
    <li> I received my first Speed Stick Gear complimentary from Influenster. I really like Speed Stick Gear. It works very well as an antiperspirant and the Fresh Force scent is great. The only think I don&#x27;t like about it is how strong the scent is. It overwhelmed my cologne, but I like the scent, so overall everything was fine.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend has been using this deodorant for as long as I habe known him, I love the smell! It definitely prevents b.o.! Every now and then ill misplace my deodorant and get to use this one! It goes on so smoothly and keeps you nice and fresh all day! Love it!</li>
    <li> Great product, helps keep you dry all day and with a pretty good fragrance thats not too strong but also not too weak.  heavy sweater here so can appreciate how effective the speed stick gear is!</li>
    <li> Honestly between eating healthier and using a mineral stick as needed, neither of us have used Antiperspirant in a few years.  Seriously.  And we definitely no longer suffer from body odor.  But I was curious.  A guy SHOULD have some deoderant around as needed, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The odor is far too chemically harsh! I guess we&#x27;re spoiled since we don&#x27;t use as many chemicals in our home anymore (we clean with baking soda, water, pine sol, lemon juice, white vinegar, rubbing alcohol, etc)  but I was really taken aback by the odor.  My husband who once seemingly consumed antiperspirants looked on reluctantly as he opened the container.  The stench was so overpowering he couldn&#x27;t bring himself to using it on his body.  THEN we read the ingredients.. AND the warnings...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Safety Warning. For external use only. Do not use on broken skin. Ask a doctor before use if you have kidney disease. Stop use if rash or irritation occurs. Keep out of reach of children. If swallowed, get medical help or contact a Poison Control Center right away.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YIKES.  Do I want that on our skin?  And he has had former kidney issues so we do try to protect the kidneys from further injury...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Ingredients: Active Ingredient - Purpose. Aluminum Zirconium Tetrachlorohydrex Gly 16% - Antiperspirant. Inactive Ingredients: Elaeis Guineensis (Palm) Kernel Oil, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Cyclomethicone, Synthetic Wax, PEG-8 Distearate, Hydrogenated Soybean Oil, Fragrance.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if the chemical odor is from the &amp;#34;Fragrance&amp;#34; or the chemicals, but we&#x27;ll resume using the mineral sticks (as needed.)</li>
    <li> This antiperspirant has a nice clean scent. I borrowed it from my husband the other day and even though it&#x27;s geared for men, it worked great for me as well. I can&#x27;t say that it lasted 48 hours (I kinda like to take a shower at least once every 24 hours, lol), but it did a good job for the 24 hours I wore it.  I was pleased.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, works excellent.  Never have sweated a drop while using this product.  I&#x27;m an active person (HVAC Tech) and sometimes end up working in some rather warm environment&#x27;s and Speed Stick Gear Drycore has never left me down.  Now on the flip side, because the product works well as an antiperspirant its funny to me but its actually kinda hard to wash off in the shower.  If your not careful and your rush yourself cleaning in the shower you&#x27;ll get out and still have some on.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it sounds like a pain but its not.  Like I said - kinda funny.  I look at it as a great product that is very tough and waterproof!  I turned my dad on to this stuff and he loves it.  I use the Drycore, that&#x27;s the stuff I&#x27;m talking about.  I&#x27;ve used the Freshcore and it doesn&#x27;t work as well but still good....  and easier to wash off :)  Personal preference I&#x27;m sure...  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Fantastic quality and smell, lasts for at least a day (I shower daily so I can&#x27;t verify more than that! Quick delivery.</li>
