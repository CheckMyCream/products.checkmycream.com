      <li>This stuff is awesome!</li>
      <li>This stuff is awesome.</li>
      <li>i knew it was going to be great.</li>
      <li>it feels amazing!</li>
      <li>It smells like mint and feels so good on your hair.</li>
      <li>but it still works as good as it did.</li>
      <li>Not as good as I remember the line from years ago.</li>
      <li>I used and loved this product years ago &amp; was beyond bummed when they discontinued it.</li>
      <li>Its light weight but does a great good at detangling your hair.</li>
      <li>The smell is great, it keeps my hair clean, and it detangles too!</li>
      <li>Love using this shampoo and conditioner during the summer!  </li>
      <li>The best conditioner for all of my beautiful blonde friends.</li>
      <li>Nice smelling.</li>
      <li>It has a wonderful scent and works very well.</li>
      <li>While I would prefer to use natural products, I  have to say, this is one of the best detangling conditioners that I&#x27;ve ever used and, the smell is nice.</li>
      <li>so it gets knotty VERY easily.</li>
      <li>when i take it out, i love the amazing shine and softness my hair gets.</li>
      <li>I feel like it&#x27;s not quite as good as the original though.</li>
      <li>It used to make my hair smooth &amp; fly away free even in the toughest humidity.</li>
      <li>It does still have the same awesome scent &amp; cooling sensation which is welcome in the hot weather!</li>
      <li>It goes tend to make my hair more wavy, which is not a plus for me.</li>
      <li>This is the best product line I have ever used for my blonde hair.</li>
      <li>Love this</li>
      <li>Love this conditioner.  </li>
      <li>it had a great minty fresh scent that made my hair feel so alive and happy.</li>
      <li>smells fantastic and absolutley love</li>
      <li>I found that the detangler conditioner did not make combing my fine hair easy.</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair soft and clean and smells great.</li>
      <li>Fantastic product for the price.  </li>
      <li>I love this product and have already reordered it twice since my first order 2 months ago, so that I always have it available.</li>
      <li>I decided to try the conditioner, and I was not disappointed.</li>
      <li>The mint is so refreshing and further more, my hair is brushable right out of the shower!</li>
      <li>Finally, after 10 years,  John Freida brought back this wonderful product!</li>
      <li>This conditioner (and its companion shampoo Beach Blonde Cool Dip) are light, cleansing and have the most refreshing scent - really like a day at the beach.</li>
      <li>but it is worth the try</li>
      <li>I never tried this stuff back in the day, but I did have the original Beach Blonde shampoo, which I absolutely loved.</li>
      <li>my hair is very light brown, not quite blonde.</li>
      <li>The scent is very refreshing, and if you leave the conditioner on your hair for a few minutes, it provides an icy cool tingling sensation to your scalp, which feels really nice.</li>
      <li>First time using this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad they brought this product back!</li>
      <li>Also, no matter how many hair products I use after I get out of the shower (and I use SEVERAL), the scent of this conditioner stays in my hair for days!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll follow up with this after  Beach blonde shampoo ..put in my hair for a few minutes  and Great  mint smell people will notice</li>
      <li>Very lightweight &amp; leaves my hair shiny.</li>
      <li>So I was super stoked to see that they brought back this line!</li>
      <li>I first discovered it about 10 years ago at 6.99 a bottle and bought regularly until it was discontinued.</li>
      <li>it is also very think, coarse, and naturally curly.</li>
      <li>and I noticed my hair was really shinny when used regularly.</li>
      <li>I think I&#x27;ll stick to my redken soft touch</li>
      <li>My hair isn&#x27;t naturally blonde, but I really think this can be used by any hair type.</li>
      <li>I highly recomend this for people with color treated blonde hair.</li>
      <li>I think the bottle is a little bigger and couple of dollars more and slightly different in the smell</li>
      <li>My hair is thick, porous, and coarse, and this stuff just sinks right into my strands, which I love.</li>
      <li>I barely leave it on my hair before I rinse</li>
      <li>once i rinsed my hair out, unlike any other conditioner i used, i didnt have one single knot in my hair, and it felt so fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have really long, wavy, thick hair that tangles easily and is a nightmare to comb out after a shower.</li>
      <li>/&gt;i let my hair air dry while its in a loose, high bun.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Love this and it is hard to find!  Love using this shampoo and conditioner during the summer!  thank you</li>
    <li> i am a conditioner junky. i looked in the store, and i found this product. on my way home i was not sure about purchasing it. it turns out&lt;br /&gt;i was 100% WRONG! once i rubbed this stuff in my hands i knew it was going to be great. it had a great minty fresh scent that made my hair feel so alive and happy. my hair is very light brown, not quite blonde. it is also very think, coarse, and naturally curly. so it gets knotty VERY easily. but all i needed was the tinest glob to get through my hair. it feels amazing! once i rinsed my hair out, unlike any other conditioner i used, i didnt have one single knot in my hair, and it felt so fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i let my hair air dry while its in a loose, high bun. when i take it out, i love the amazing shine and softness my hair gets. Im going to be using this for a long time!</li>
    <li> Do not buy this if your hair is oily.</li>
    <li> I used and loved this product years ago &amp; was beyond bummed when they discontinued it. I was stoked to see it at the local beauty supply store. I feel like it&#x27;s not quite as good as the original though. It used to make my hair smooth &amp; fly away free even in the toughest humidity. I&#x27;ve found it slightly drying to my hair now. It does still have the same awesome scent &amp; cooling sensation which is welcome in the hot weather!</li>
    <li> Not as good as I remember the line from years ago. It goes tend to make my hair more wavy, which is not a plus for me. Very lightweight &amp; leaves my hair shiny. Just wish it was a little thicker &amp; didn&#x27;t make my hair wavy.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m so glad they brought this product back! I used it over a decade ago and have always been on the lookout for its return. The smell is great, it keeps my hair clean, and it detangles too!</li>
    <li> I have really long, wavy, thick hair that tangles easily and is a nightmare to comb out after a shower. While I would prefer to use natural products, I  have to say, this is one of the best detangling conditioners that I&#x27;ve ever used and, the smell is nice.

The scent is very refreshing, and if you leave the conditioner on your hair for a few minutes, it provides an icy cool tingling sensation to your scalp, which feels really nice. My hair isn&#x27;t naturally blonde, but I really think this can be used by any hair type. My hair is thick, porous, and coarse, and this stuff just sinks right into my strands, which I love. I didn&#x27;t buy this for the detangling properties, but the detangling aspect works well. No tangles when I&#x27;m blowdrying my chest-length hair. Also, no matter how many hair products I use after I get out of the shower (and I use SEVERAL), the scent of this conditioner stays in my hair for days!</li>
    <li> Finally, after 10 years,  John Freida brought back this wonderful product! This conditioner (and its companion shampoo Beach Blonde Cool Dip) are light, cleansing and have the most refreshing scent - really like a day at the beach. Fantastic product for the price.  I can only say thank you, thank you, thank you for putting this back on the shelves!</li>
    <li> This is the best product line I have ever used for my blonde hair. I first discovered it about 10 years ago at 6.99 a bottle and bought regularly until it was discontinued. Now its back again!!. I think the bottle is a little bigger and couple of dollars more and slightly different in the smell but it still works as good as it did. I highly recomend this for people with color treated blonde hair. It leaves your hair very soft and silky and it has a slight minty smell and a slight tingle when used. It also helps quite a bit with detangeling long hair and I noticed my hair was really shinny when used regularly. I realized not everyones hair is the same but it is worth the try and you can find coupons for this product currently.</li>
    <li> The best conditioner for all of my beautiful blonde friends. The mint is so refreshing and further more, my hair is brushable right out of the shower!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! I barely leave it on my hair before I rinse and it keeps hair from tangling!</li>
    <li> I used this product years ago and then they stopped making it. Found it today at a drug store. This stuff is awesome. It smells like mint and feels so good on your hair. Its light weight but does a great good at detangling your hair. Its for any hair color not  just blondes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll follow up with this after  Beach blonde shampoo ..put in my hair for a few minutes  and Great  mint smell people will notice hey  a mom must have ðŸ˜„</li>
    <li> smells fantastic and absolutley love he way it makes my hair feel - hard to find in stores !!!!</li>
