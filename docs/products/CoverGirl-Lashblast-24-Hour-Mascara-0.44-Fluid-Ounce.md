<ol>
      <li>Awesome!</li>
      <li>Cover girl Lasblast mascaras, the best.</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>lol.</li>
      <li>Great mascara.</li>
      <li>Good Quality / Prompt Shipment</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Love this product!</li>
      <li>But my problem with it is that it does kind of clump up on me and</li>
      <li>So happy the price was right</li>
      <li>This is my favorite mascara that I don&#x27;t have to go to a department store to buy.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really pleased with it.</li>
      <li>It also is easy on my eyes, does not cause any itching of the eyes, and does not come off in pieces like some of the other water proof stuff does, an all around perfect product.</li>
      <li>Goes on easy and stays on all day.</li>
      <li>But that is fine with me.</li>
      <li>Great mascara makes your lashes look very long when it states 24 hours</li>
      <li>It goes on very nice and makes your lashes look very long and full.</li>
      <li>had found it in a gorgeous midnight blue mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The color is nice; it doesn&#x27;t have a strong blue color</li>
      <li>Just exactly what I wanted!</li>
      <li>Even when I deviate to another kind I end up coming back to this.</li>
      <li>If you just want a nice blue mascara you might like this one.</li>
      <li>Great buy and not easy to find!</li>
      <li>very very dark!&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
      <li>This is what stays at home always as i never need it during the day to reapply ;)</li>
      <li>Soften it first</li>
      <li>It really irritated my eyes...</li>
      <li>I really like this mascara; there is almost always a tube of it in my make up bag.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to like this mascara as I had previously used one by L&#x27;Oreal which was a true super inky blue/black, however, L&#x27;Oreal has discontinued that product.  </li>
      <li>so it is more black than anything.</li>
      <li>This mascara is simply a nice navy blue and not a very dark navy blue either.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s rare to find navy/midnight blue mascara.  </li>
      <li>Better than so many of the expensive mascaras I&#x27;ve tied!</li>
      <li>I rarely use it and should have sent it back for a refund as I can barely see any color at all on my lashes.  </li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t really notice the blue hue like I was hoping for....</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a super dark (blue/black) mascara</li>
      <li>The lasting power is as good as they claim,  and is even difficult to remove with non-oily eye makeup remover (I had to use baby oil to remove it completely).  </li>
      <li>Love this cover girl product and it&#x27;s hard to find especially that color</li>
      <li>It really lasts, be careful removing.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Anyway, since none of these are current production, be aware that if you&#x27;re buying this in 2015 or later you&#x27;re buying an old dried up mascara that WILL FLAKE.  </li>
      <li>So I guess that is a good and a bad thing.</li>

<li> I have grey eyes and since all other eye colors seem to get personalized color recommendations, and mine has NOTHING</li>
<li> I have white eye lashes very odd looking with out mascara</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure I even find much blue in it at all-</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t agree with the other review.  </li>
<li> Too dark and waterproof for me.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
<li> this mascara does not run, it does not leave black marks under my eyes, and I work around water, in the sun with sun screan lotion on, yet it still does not run.</li>
<li> This blue/black is VERY BLACK..</li>
<li> This one is black with a very faint trace of blue.  </li>
<li> so you don&#x27;t tug too hard.  </li>
<li> I bought this mascara on-line as I was looking for navy and it was hard to find.</li>
<li> BUT when they say 24 hours, they mean it.</li>
<li> The mascara was opened when I received it and when I tried to use it it was mostly dried out!!!</li>
<li> Poor quality.</li>
<li> I was so sad when this started to flake.  </li>

    <li> Just exactly what I wanted!</li>
    <li> Good Quality / Prompt Shipment</li>
    <li> Great mascara. Last throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Great product. No clumping. Goes on easy and stays on all day. I&#x27;m really pleased with it.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this mascara as I had previously used one by L&#x27;Oreal which was a true super inky blue/black, however, L&#x27;Oreal has discontinued that product.  I was hoping that the Cover Girl 24 hour blue/black mascara would be a similar color.  But, no!  This mascara is simply a nice navy blue and not a very dark navy blue either.  The lasting power is as good as they claim,  and is even difficult to remove with non-oily eye makeup remover (I had to use baby oil to remove it completely).  If you are looking for a super dark (blue/black) mascara this is not it. If you just want a nice blue mascara you might like this one. I would not buy this again.</li>
    <li> This is what stays at home always as i never need it during the day to reapply ;)</li>
    <li> I really like this mascara; there is almost always a tube of it in my make up bag. Even when I deviate to another kind I end up coming back to this.</li>
    <li> Cover girl Lasblast mascaras, the best.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Love this cover girl product and it&#x27;s hard to find especially that color</li>
    <li> I was so sad when this started to flake.  I have grey eyes and since all other eye colors seem to get personalized color recommendations, and mine has NOTHING, I wanted a signature color to make my eyes pop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had found it in a gorgeous midnight blue mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was promptly discontinued because I guess someone at HQ heared I had found it.  I don&#x27;t even know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, since none of these are current production, be aware that if you&#x27;re buying this in 2015 or later you&#x27;re buying an old dried up mascara that WILL FLAKE.  All over.  All over your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was the bomb when they were still newer back in Jan 2014.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t really notice the blue hue like I was hoping for....</li>
    <li> I like it. The color is nice; it doesn&#x27;t have a strong blue color so it is more black than anything. But that is fine with me. But my problem with it is that it does kind of clump up on me and it is a wetter formula so it takes a while to dry. I also dislike the brush. BUT when they say 24 hours, they mean it. After I put it on and it dries fully, I can rub my eyes and none comes off. Sometimes at the end of the day it will take a while for me to get it off. So I guess that is a good and a bad thing. So if you are looking for longevity then this is the one for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR You need patience to use it but if you need a mascara to stay on for a while, then use this one.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used yet but the color is what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I bought this mascara on-line as I was looking for navy and it was hard to find. Lancome stopped making it in blue.  I rarely use it and should have sent it back for a refund as I can barely see any color at all on my lashes.  Won&#x27;t make the mistake of buying this product again!  Poor quality.</li>
    <li> this mascara does not run, it does not leave black marks under my eyes, and I work around water, in the sun with sun screan lotion on, yet it still does not run. I have white eye lashes very odd looking with out mascara so this product is just what I have been looking for for ever. It also is easy on my eyes, does not cause any itching of the eyes, and does not come off in pieces like some of the other water proof stuff does, an all around perfect product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s rare to find navy/midnight blue mascara.  This one is black with a very faint trace of blue.  If you want blue, this is not for you.  I don&#x27;t want dayglow blue lashes, so this is perfectnfor me.  Also, the formula doesn&#x27;t harden my lashes.</li>
    <li> Wear it all the time.  It really lasts, be careful removing.  Soften it first so you don&#x27;t tug too hard.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Better than so many of the expensive mascaras I&#x27;ve tied!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t agree with the other review.  This blue/black is VERY BLACK.. I&#x27;m not sure I even find much blue in it at all- very very dark!&lt;br /&gt;Also it stays on alright, I can&#x27;t get it off!!  This mascara is a waterproof in disguise, they just don&#x27;t label it as such.  I will not be buying it again.  Too dark and waterproof for me.&lt;br /&gt;On a lighter note.. It goes on very nice and makes your lashes look very long and full.</li>
    <li> Awesome! Great buy and not easy to find! So happy the price was right and so was the product! yay!!!!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite mascara that I don&#x27;t have to go to a department store to buy. It sometimes irritates my contact lenses (gas permeable) but not always. Love this product!</li>
    <li> It really irritated my eyes...</li>
    <li> The mascara was opened when I received it and when I tried to use it it was mostly dried out!!!</li>
    <li> Great mascara makes your lashes look very long when it states 24 hours it means it lol. Will buy again</li>
