<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I really like the Nivea Men&#x27;s line of products - I use the face wash, face scrub, and face protector - so I has high hopes for this product, but I have mixed feelings on it. The bottom line is It works as promised, it moisturizes well, dries relatively quickly, and lasts a long time, however the fragrance  is more pungent than I expected, to the point where it bothers me. The smell is not necessarily unpleasant - it smells kind of like a unisex Calvin Klein perfume (not particularly masculine or feminine). In fact when I complained of the smell to my girlfriend, she tried it and said she would be happy to use it if I didn&#x27;t want to. I would continue to use the lotion if the fragrance was weaker, but as is, I find it too unpleasant to wear. And the scent doesn&#x27;t fade much over time - the stuff works so well you will smell it for hours. I hope they reconsider the formula!</li>
    <li> Bought for Dad for xmas and the bottle is almost empty so he likes it for his very dry skin. I used it once myself while visiting and I enjoy the scent.</li>
    <li> Great lotion for daily use.  Not to greasy and dries quick.  Really effective on face and neck.</li>
    <li> Product description was right on. Great product, works as advertsed. God bless you. Thanks</li>
    <li> My husband has a dry skin problem and this is the only product that did him any good. I have spent a pretty penny on other products and dry skin solutions that failed. Excellent formula</li>
    <li> Makes you skin feel soft, hydrated and silky. I use this daily. I expose my skin to heat and sun a lot and this helps counteract the effects of this. I would buy this product again. The product does what it says it does.</li>
    <li> Excellent for dry skin. Use it daily after I shower. Not too thick - spreads easily. Minimal odor.</li>
    <li> Bought as add on item. Great Price.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Very light and does not leave a residue. Claims that it last 24 hours and it&#x27;s close to meeting that claim.</li>
    <li> Excellent very good product I loved thanks :)</li>
    <li> This was great nice smell to it too</li>
    <li> My grandson loves this lotion. Actually, it was to have been for me, but I am glad I made someone very happy with this. Very moisturizing and a nice, light masculine scent. He likes it a lot.</li>
    <li> Outstanding lotion.  Soothes and moisturizes.  Long lasting.</li>
    <li> It puts the lotion on it&#x27;s skin or else it gets the hose again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, this is a fine quality product and hopefully is not used for serial killing purposes.</li>
    <li> Wow. Just wow. works better than stuff that costs 5 times as much. I only wish I could find it in travel size.</li>
    <li> This works ok. I Have tried other Nivea Men products and liked them immensely so I figured I&#x27;d try this hydration lotion. It is fairly &amp;#34;thin&amp;#34; as a lotion. Kind of greasy, but absorbs quickly, so you shouldn&#x27;t have an issue with that. I have EXTREMELY dry skin. I find myself putting lotion on multiple times a day and it still seems to lack compared to other lotions.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is different than the Nivea Men Protective lotion. I was hoping it was the same, but it isn&#x27;t. I prefer the smell of the protective lotion and it works better, and has sunscreen to boot!</li>
    <li> Great lotion, I use it daily.  It is great universally including the face and hands.  Everything now it smooth and not dry, fantastic product.  I will definitely buy more when I need a refill.</li>
    <li> The lotion is pretty good. I&#x27;m not used to getting men-specific moisturizer, so have no clue whether they&#x27;re thicker or lighter than most other/unisex moisturizers. However, this one seemed pretty light, and is easy to apply. I have no complaints so far!</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this product. I hate feeling greasy and I hate smelling flowery. I thought this would be do the trick, how it didn&#x27;t. I have to constantly remoisturize during the winter...this doesn&#x27;t do a good enough job keeping my skin from drying out. I had to turn to Aveeno to take care of my dry skin this winter. However, during any other season, this seems to do fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say the smell is a plus-- it is a nice clean, cologne-ish scent. I will also say that it absorbs quickly which is great if you hate the greasy feel like me.</li>
    <li> Works well without feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion to keep in the office during these cold Chicago winters.  I find that, with the weather and dealing with paper throughout the day, my hands get very dry - sometimes, even painfully so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion smells great (a very light scent), it goes on and sinks in easily, and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hands with a sticky or oily residue.  After a few minutes, my hands feel nothing but soft - and they seem to stay that way for quite a long time.</li>
    <li> Works well, just like pretty much any Nivea product. The problem is that while it is labeled &amp;#34;for men&amp;#34; it smells as strongly of sweet girly crap as many other lotions.</li>
    <li> non-greasy, good fragrance - the only lotion I use now</li>
    <li> This product offers great hydration without being greasy, or breaking my sensitive skin out. However, it is a little thin. I like my lotions to be of a thicker consistency. Would I buy this product again? Only if I could not find something different, that would suit my needs.</li>
    <li> Husband says it&#x27;s &amp;#34;too dry&amp;#34;...went back to back to men&#x27;s lotion.</li>
    <li> Bigger than I thought, but it is perfact</li>
    <li> The most unique feeling moisturizer I have ever used. I use it in my face daily. I used to struggle with looking shiny at the end of the day with other brands. It is slightly matifying and still adds moisture.</li>
    <li> Has a light pleasant smell, takes some time to absorb but once it does isn&#x27;t too greasy. Leaves skin smooth and comfortable. Not sure what the sea minerals (read: sea salt) are supposed to benefit but a very nice lotion for daily use. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Great lotion! Feels light and silky, not thick and oily like avino</li>
    <li> Great product. I get dry skin and this is perfect.</li>
    <li> Does the job well in a Minnesota winter - when it is super dry at -40c</li>
    <li> Slight masculine scent, moisturizes really well!</li>
    <li> Good moisturizer for men. Not greasy, very lightweight, doesn&#x27;t feel like you are wearing anything. Definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Awful smell!! Can&#x27;t use it!  It smells like the cheapest perfume! They need to wake up at Nivea...this stuff is just bad!!</li>
    <li> This lotion is effective and is one of the best smelling lotions I have ever used. The effects last most of the day to keep my hands very well moisturized. There is also a scent that one relative of mine mentioned is competitive with one of my colognes! I would say that this cheap product is well worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> Works really well. I suggest putting it on after washing then pat-drying the affected area. Once in the morning and once at night.</li>
    <li> Works well on my skin!</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this lotion! Very hydrating, lasts a long time, and drys quickly. Good value. What more can I say?</li>
    <li> there is an odor, but not overly strong&lt;br /&gt;goes on well, not too greasy&lt;br /&gt;arms noticeably less dry</li>
    <li> great price, smells great and delivered right to your doorstep.</li>
    <li> SMELLS GREAT&lt;br /&gt;Leaves skin soft and not oily</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t smell like it normally does, I have another bottle of this, I think it&#x27;s a knock off</li>
    <li> Used to buy it in drug stores, but it seems they&#x27;re not carrying it anymore. Excellent quality lotion, the best I&#x27;ve tried. Dries quickly, not greasy at all, and leaves a very gentle non-intrusive scent.</li>
    <li> NIVEA always puts out great men&#x27;s products.  I liked this a lot since i&#x27;m lazy and don&#x27;t want to pick out different lotions for all areas of my body.  I can smear this on my face, arms, legs, and go!</li>
    <li> I have dry hands and wanted something thick and really liked the Nivea hand cream so decided to use their lotion since it was a great price. In my opinion it isn&#x27;t as great as the hand cream but it is defiantly better than other lotions.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m moist. What more can I say.</li>
    <li> Great price and it works wonders on dry skin :-)</li>
    <li> Moisturizes well, non greasy, fast absorbing. I like the scent, too. It usually goes always after a few hours. I use it after bath, after swimming, or in the winter -- really makes a difference for dry skin.</li>
    <li> Smells good and works even better. The perfect pump</li>
    <li> For several months, I&#x27;ve been using [[ASIN:B009YSSLBY Dove Men+Care Face Lotion, Revitalize]] and really like it.  Amazon stopped carrying that on Subscribe and Size, and the price went up a decent amount...so I started looking around.  You know, because I&#x27;m cheap.  :)  I happen to like most of the NIVEA products that I&#x27;ve bought, so this caught my attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d never seen it around before, but I&#x27;m really glad that I gave it a try.  REALLY glad.  It&#x27;s _significantly_ cheaper that the Dove lotion - less than 1/10th the price, actually - and so far, I like it just as much.  Better, actually.  The reason that I like the Dove Revitalize version is because it isn&#x27;t a sunscreen lotion, isn&#x27;t watery, goes on smooth, hydrates my face, and isn&#x27;t greasy.  Well, guess what?  This lotion is the same way.  I really, really like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only is it good on my face, but it&#x27;s also easily cheap enough to use for its other stated purposes - hands and body.  I rarely ever thought about using the Dove on my hands because it&#x27;s too expensive, but this is even cheaper than the hand lotion that I buy at Target (this cost me about $4.50 for the 16.9-ounce bottle as an Add-on Item).  The scent wouldn&#x27;t be my first choice, but it certainly isn&#x27;t bad, and it&#x27;s better than the regular hand lotion that I&#x27;ve used for years.  I&#x27;d try to describe the scent for you, but I&#x27;d fail miserably...so badly that I&#x27;d deserve my own internet poster.  So, I&#x27;ll move on...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a nutshell, I highly (HIGHLY) recommend this lotion.  I think it works great on my face, as well as my hands and body.  I just added it to my subscriptions to start getting it regularly.  It&#x27;s easily worth the $4.50-ish price tag to try out.</li>
    <li> As a guy its nice to use a lotion that doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering smell. NIVEA hit the ball out of the park with this lotion for men.  It goes on easy, doesn&#x27;t have a overpowering smell, and can be used on your entire body and face. I&#x27;m happy to note that it doesn&#x27;t, for me at least, block the pores on my face and contribute to acne. WARNING: It says NIVEA MEN on the front but that won&#x27;t deter your gf/sister from using it if they run out of their own lotion.</li>
    <li> What else can one say when it comes to quality, you get what you pay for.  Nivea is a great company with great products.  9th purchase this yr.</li>
    <li> Very effective for dry skin. Fragance is a touch too strong but nothing overwhelming. Recommended for winter months especially for people with dry skin</li>
    <li> I purchased this lotion last year (2013), and I am glad I did. My hands get very dry because I work a lot with paper; but every lotion I&#x27;ve used leaves my hands so greasy and icky feeling. This lotion is much better than your average regular lotion. It also smells great, even after it has dried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it could be a little quicker in drying. It takes maybe 2 minutes in this hot and humid weather.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried alot of lotions, but this one is my favorite. It&#x27;s light enough to go on your face without feeling greasy, and it also works well for all other body parts.</li>
    <li> Who needs a girlfriend?</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t expecting such a perfumed scent in a men&#x27;s lotion.  My husband hates the smell and it is too strong for me as well, so I guess I&#x27;ll see if a family member will take it.  I can&#x27;t vouch for how well the lotion works, because after putting a small amount on my arm to try, we know we&#x27;ll never use it again.</li>
    <li> Nivea Maximum Hydration, where have you been all my life? Seriously.    For as long as I can remember, I have had issues with dry, flaky skin on my face; and no lotion was ever able to adequately hydrate my skin enough to eliminate the issues. The best solution I had found was my wife&#x27;s Mary Kay lotion, but she quit selling the stuff, so the cost was too high -- and it was only moderately effective.    I am completely sold on the Nivea for Men lotion. The scent is not necessarily my first choice, but it fades quickly, and the resulting hydration is totally worth any momentary olfactory offenses. I can apply one generous helping in the morning, and my skin will stay smooth and hydrated throughout the day, even during cold, dry, winter weather. I really can&#x27;t say enough about how elated I am to have this lotion in my life now.    On the cost side of things, I was shocked when I saw how large of a container you get for the price. I was fully expecting a tiny bottle that would need to be replaced in short order, but this thing is quite large. That fact alone should put it at six stars!</li>
    <li> Most of NIVEA&#x27;s stuff is high quality and I trust the brand. I guess each skin type is different and different skin products work well for each type. For me, this is the only body lotion I use and it works well for me for a couple of reasons,&lt;br /&gt;1. This is the only lotion I need to use.&lt;br /&gt;2. This keeps my skin hydrated for the whole day.</li>
    <li> Very good product. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have always preferred Nivea products for all my face cleanser, shaving cream, and face and body lotions needs; of all the Nivea lotions I&#x27;ve tried this is by far the best. It&#x27;s not a sticky lotion like some and has a nice clean scent.</li>
    <li> Works great, I&#x27;m gonna buy it again and again.</li>
    <li> I have been using Nivea body lotions for over 5 years and keep buying it. I usually don&#x27;t think of buying any other brands when it comes to body lotions. Nivea makes great product for men and Nivea Men Maximum Hydration Nourishing Lotion is one of such products. It is light on skin, has pleasant, light, manly smell and skin feels very smooth and lightly shiny after applying it. Nourishing effect stays throughout the day.</li>
    <li> When I combine this with the benefits of having a Culligan shower filter I have not had to use any Hydro-cortisone for almost a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is long lasting and very economical. GF enjoys the smell.</li>
    <li> I love this. It is not greasy, is easy to apply (it is easily absorbed by my skin), and my skin feels soft and moisturised for the whole day. Previous lotions I have used have either been too oily, or my skin feels dry after a few hours. This meets all of my needs, and is priced very well for such a high quality body lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife used to use much more expensive lotions for her and our children, but now they all use this as they agree with me on how easy it is to apply, how well it makes their skin feel, and how long it lasts.</li>
    <li> Have tried many lotions and found this one to work the best even on my head seeing that I save it bald keeps my head from getting any flakes :)</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t particulary care for the frangrance. Prefer no frangrance. Cannot use product. Wish i had refund. Not worth trouble to return.</li>
    <li> Can you really write a good review for lotion? I give it four stars. My skin was very dry. Now it is not. However I don&#x27;t think about this product and if it was not right next to my deodorant I would forget to use it so it can&#x27;t be five stars.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this lotion! Super fast absorption! Clean! Non-greasy! Perfect for my Face and Body!</li>
    <li> When working with soil in my garden, my hands get very dry and my skin becomes cracked.  I tried this product and found it to be perfect for dry hands.  I also apply it to dry spots on my face and it works well there too.  This lotion is very gentle and it does not irritate my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion has a very light, masculine scent.  If you&#x27;ve ever smelled a candle or soap that has an &amp;#34;ocean&amp;#34; scent, this pretty much smells the same.  I am very fond of that particular scent, so I really like this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE BACK OF THE BOTTLE SAYS THE FOLLOWING:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;NIVEA FOR MEN Maximum Hydration Body Lotion boosts the moisture level in the skin and intensively moisturizes.  Specifically formulated for men with dry skin, this lotion with Hydra-IQ technology absorbs in seconds with no greasy after feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With:&lt;br /&gt;Non-stop Hydra IQ Technology&lt;br /&gt;Sea Minerals&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Benefit:&lt;br /&gt;All day moisturization&lt;br /&gt;Revitalizes skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NIVEA&#x27;S exclusive Hydra IQ technology supports skin&#x27;s own hydration network to unleash deep, non-stop moisture that lasts more than 24 hours&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:  Water, Glycerin, Isopropyl Palmitate, Alcohol Denat., Glyceryl Stearate SE, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Tapioca Starch, Dimethicone, Glyceryl Glucoside, Sea Salt, Carbomer, Fragance, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Ethylparaben&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Absorbs quickly into dry skin, and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling.  This is the best lotion I have ever used.</li>
    <li> The bottle is much bigger than I expected, for a nice, cheap price. I instantly put some on my face and it felt great and the creamy feel was gone in seconds. Does what it advertises with quality and quantity.</li>
    <li> Its a light hydrating lotion formula. The smell isn&#x27;t that bad but there is fragrance if your skin is allergic to it. If you&#x27;re used to stuff like gold bond then this may feel &amp;#34;thin/light&amp;#34;. Its designed to absorb fast.</li>
    <li> Goes on a little thicker than I thought it would. It does have a scent that is not too manly but not too feminine. I like the smell my GF thinks it dosnet smell too manly.</li>
    <li> This works really well. Not greasy, non-irritating and a nice scent. Everything I&#x27;ve gotten from Nivea for Men is top rate.</li>
    <li> The lotion itself maybe is fine, but the extreme fragrance is overwhelming. If you are going to have a product specifically for men there should be no fragrance whatsoever.</li>
    <li> Good lotion for the winter.  Has a touch more greasy feel and staying power then the regular nivea lotion that i use in the summer.  Good product.</li>
    <li> Nice smell, not thick or greasy.</li>
    <li> I agree with some of the other reviewers about the smell - absolutely horrible. Had to throw product away. Can&#x27;t believe that so many others like this product.</li>
    <li> Product met my expectations. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE BEST LOTION it REALLY WORKS!!!!!  It is a little more expensive than the others, but once rub on your skin it is absorbed very QUICKLY!!&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t lay on the skin like the others, it is absorbed onto the skin. I love ALL the NIEVA Men&#x27;s products.</li>
    <li> Very good moisturizer! I have very dry, sensitive skin and this stuff works great. I would definitely recommend trying it.</li>
    <li> Effective product but a bit sticky.</li>
    <li> This lotion is one of my favorites available. There is a very light scent and no greasiness. It absorbs into the skin quickly and does a great job helping re-hydrate.</li>
    <li> My crackling dry skin are now absolutely hydrated</li>
    <li> It just moisturizes my dry knees and elbows and it lightens them too!</li>
    <li> This lotion has a very heavy scent to it,  I use scent free or mildly sensitive products but this is over powering that it&#x27;s been banished to the guest bathroom. I&#x27;ll pay closer attention to the description next time.</li>
    <li> Does have a scent and I normally like no scent but it isn&#x27;t bad or strong at all. Coats well and keeps my hands feet moist for longer than cheaper lotions. Thanks amazon with the S&amp;S Mom its a great price. Watch for coupons to make it a even better deal.</li>
    <li> James Gumb approves of this lotion.</li>
    <li> Ordered it because my existing lotion was not working. Overall Very impressed with limited usage. Will update more as I use it.</li>
    <li> Comes with a large size but I don&#x27;t like the smell... It doesn&#x27;t smell the same after applying to your skin.</li>
    <li> I get very dry skin on my hands, shins and feet once the colder weather sets in. The feet bottoms get real bad and being a Type II Diabetic, that&#x27;s not a good thing to have. I&#x27;ve tried a few other brands like Lubriderm, etc to no avail. Even that &#x27;foot crack healer&#x27; lotion didn&#x27;t work for me. This stuff is great. I don&#x27;t have to use it but a couple of times a week and I&#x27;m good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the aroma... it&#x27;s a bit strong and not too pleasant but not too unpleasant if you get the drift of that. I would prefer no aroma but I use it when I&#x27;m not out and about and plan on staying home for the night or just watching football all day. It definitely works better for me than anything I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
    <li> I have a dry and irritated skin, and if I use this my skin heals over night!&lt;br /&gt;It gives you a cool/burning sensation, but do not worry; it is just hydrating your skin!</li>
    <li> This is quickly becoming a favorite lotion in my home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along with the superb hydration it provides your skin, the smell is absolutely wonderful. It provides a great lemony citrus aroma which never gets old, though be careful applying it after a shave or with open pores because it could sting a bit. The viscosity of this lotion is also perfect as it isn&#x27;t thick and paste-like as some lotions are, but it&#x27;s not really watery either, it&#x27;s somewhere between and it allows you to get a good amount of spread without having to load up your hand constantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great daily use lotion that will leave you feeling fresh and soft-skinned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con I can report is that the top of this bottle can easily turn in transit and allow it to be pressed when being tossed around, causing lotion to pump out onto other items in your box.</li>
    <li> Even smells nice....not to strong, but Manley</li>
    <li> I tried this one a whim and have been pleasantly surprised by it.  It goes on almost wet/greasy feeling that&#x27;s at first alarming, but it absorbs and dries quickly onto the skin, and lasts for a long time.  It has a nice cologne-like fragrance.</li>
    <li> Great price, goes on smoothe</li>
    <li> Too bad.  Seems like a good lotion.  But why such a strong scent?  This might have garnered 4...even 5 stars but for the overwhelming scent.  It actually bothered my eyes.  This is presented as a body, hand and facial lotion.  I have trouble even just using it on my hands as it still bothers me.  Now it might just be me...but even my wife agreed.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great texture, scent and quality. No complaints</li>
    <li> I guess my son likes it.</li>
    <li> Smells and feels great!</li>
    <li> Great lotion, really works good.</li>
    <li> this is the best lotion I have ever used! A must have</li>
    <li> Good lotion -- although it feels a bit watery, it&#x27;s really not and gets absorbed fairly quickly into your skin.  Would probably use something a bit thicker for really dry skin, but for daily use this really hits the spot.  It&#x27;s quite affordable and has a masculine (but not too overpowering) scent.</li>
    <li> good at moisturizing but I don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
    <li> Smell is a little different, but not strong enough to worry about.  Absorbs in as it should.</li>
    <li> Nice lotion as per my grandsons.</li>
    <li> Moisture but cheap fragance made me allergy with.</li>
    <li> Cheap and good product. Great for body may be not so good for face because doesn&#x27;t dry as quick and makes me sweat.</li>
    <li> My son tells me this is one of the best lotion he has ever try. I buy it every year for my three co-workers...they really like it!</li>
    <li> Smells great, perfect for us men that like to smell fresh and not flowery. It does a great job of hydrating and nourishing my skin, especially in the cold dry winter days.</li>
    <li> Love the price-- I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell. Wish it smelled like most Nivea products</li>
    <li> Keeps skin from cracking and drying out with regular use, which is impressive for someone with dry skin and past eczema problems.</li>
    <li> Love the texture (isn&#x27;t greasy) and love the scent (masculine but not overpowering).  I wish they made an entire &amp;#34;line&amp;#34; of products in the same scent cause I would start using them.</li>
    <li> This lotion has a light, creamy texture that spreads and absorbs into the skin fairly quickly. The scent is also pleasant and clean, but still masculine (for those of you that worry). I&#x27;ve been using this for just a week on my hands and feet, and I can already see and feel the difference.</li>
    <li> What a deal! At first, I thought this was a bit too thick, but it rubbed in really nice and wasn&#x27;t greasy at all</li>
    <li> Very great hydrated all day long</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. My arms and hands have become very dry this winter. I used my wife&#x27;s lotion a couple times, but the smell was too strong for me. This stuff absorbs easily, leaves hands feeling silky instead of greasy, and smells amazing. A masculine smell that is present, but in no way overpowering. I&#x27;ve never used lotion daily until I bought this. Nivea for men products continue to impress.</li>
    <li> i use it everyday, after shower</li>
    <li> A little to greasy for me so I don&#x27;t like</li>
    <li> Most lotions marketed as men&#x27;s lotion really have no evident difference compared with the ones for women. This is why I&#x27;m very surprised wit this.</li>
    <li> Lotion is very moisturizing. Also the smell is very similar to Davidoff Cool Water cologne which I use.</li>
    <li> Has a nice smell but it is almost overbearing.</li>
    <li> Lasts a long time. Helps give my skin a nice glow. Smells nice.</li>
    <li> Im a huge fan of the soap.  But this lotion falls short  Has a funky smell and leaves a greasy film.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy this agian.</li>
