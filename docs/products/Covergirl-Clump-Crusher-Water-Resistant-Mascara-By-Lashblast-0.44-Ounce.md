<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This mascara is OK.  It doesn&#x27;t give me clumps, but it also tends to uncurl my lashes ... an unforgivable sin for a mascara in my opinion.  I use a very light coat to try to keep my lashes from getting too &#x27;wet&#x27; and uncurling and that is sufficient for a daytime look.  It doesn&#x27;t do anything dramatic, but gives me some color and definition.  I won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
    <li> I tried this based on the fabulous reviews, and was not disappointed. Other mascaras I&#x27;ve used tended to be either clumpy and volumizing, or smooth, and adding nothing but color (no volume). This mascara is both smooth and somewhat volumizing. It also keeps lashes fairly separated, and the black/brown color is perfect for my light complexion and casual style (it&#x27;s dark but in a more natural-looking sort of way). It&#x27;s not perfect, there are occasional clumps, but it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found so far. I am a shameless product junking who is always looking for an excuse to buy something new and different,  but I will be sticking to this mascara. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> So far, so good. No clumps and no smudges or flakes. Will test water resistance and update.</li>
    <li> I was expecting a little bit more but it&#x27;s okay</li>
    <li> It has an odd smell and seems thin in application.  Have to apply more often than expected</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t clump, as promised, but no amazing lengthening, darkening, or volumizing properties (I do have short lashes, though).  Seems pretty water-resistant, and I like the packaging and shape of the wand.</li>
    <li> Got it for a great price and it works very well. I touch my face a lot and need waterproof just so it stays without smearing, this works well for that.</li>
    <li> I had low expectations, because most mascara sucks and is clumpy, regardless of what the company wants us to believe. This stuff is outstanding. They had better not change it, because this is my new lifetime mascara. It truly does not clump. It looks natural, but you can build the layers for more drama. It&#x27;s water resistant, so it doesn&#x27;t run in humid weather, but will run if you cry or swim with it on. It&#x27;s the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> The name must mean that you have to crush the clumps on your lashes after you apply this mascara.  Then you get to try to brush away the flakes all over your checks after you&#x27;ve tried to get the clumps out.  And what&#x27;s with the size of the tube?? It&#x27;s huge.  I personally would not buy this mascara ever again.  For years my favorite mascara was Covergirl Marathon -  I was hoping to find a substitute since they took it off the market - this one doesn&#x27;t come close.</li>
    <li> My favorite mascara. I look beautimus! ;)</li>
    <li> Very good.  Like the color and coverage.</li>
    <li> Good mascara. I&#x27;ve noticed all mascaras start to dry out after about 1.5 months of usage though. Haven&#x27;t found the exception yet.</li>
    <li> This is probably my favorite of the mascaras I&#x27;ve tried, even compared to some much more expensive brands. It doesn&#x27;t clump, it defines lashes well and it has good staying power.</li>
    <li> I wear contacts and usually I don&#x27;t have a problem with mascara but for some reason I did with this brand so I was kind of disappointed.  It&#x27;s not the product - It&#x27;s my eyes...</li>
    <li> Always come back to this brand.  Easy to remove, can be apples multiple times for longer, thicker lashes.  Non-irritating, and most of all, comes off easily, even with warm water.  Gentle face wash completely removes it.</li>
    <li> Happy with this mascara. Does just what it says..no clumps. Brush is comblike with a nice shape.</li>
    <li> Water-proof mascaras are always tough because oftentimes they flake or clump up pretty badly. This one was okay...similar to most other waterproof ones in the same price range. The color is a dark, dark brown, which is nice. Harder to remove than non-waterproof mascaras, but I just used lots of eye makeup remover. Revlon Colorstay Mascaras stay FOREVER (which is great), but are the hardest to remove (I swear, I lost like, 15 eyelashes, lol). If you are in the market for something that is very long-lasting (even soap and water hardly takes it off), try to Revlon Colorstay one. Anyway, if you&#x27;re wearing this mascara casually and not planning on swimming in a pool or anything, it does the job :)</li>
    <li> I like these mascaras, they just don&#x27;t last as long as I expect. I use it nearly daily and often have to replace a tube because it gets too clumpy. So during the day it lasts, but the product doesn&#x27;t last more than a month or so after I open it. But, I can&#x27;t argue too much with a fairly good price.</li>
    <li> works good and I like it will continue to use</li>
    <li> Gets dry and flaky after a few hours.</li>
    <li> This is great mascara &#x3D;&#x3D; this one truly doesn&#x27;t clump and I need the brownish black which is hard to find.</li>
    <li> Perfection. It looks natural and truly doesn&#x27;t clump. Plus it adds some curl to my straight lashes.</li>
    <li> possibly the best mascara ever. didn&#x27;t cause raccoon eyes even in the swimming pool! can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> I have been surprised at how much I like this mascara. The wand works really well at separating my lashes. This does not clump my lashes together at all. For the price I am really happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Lately I&#x27;ve been on a search for a mascara that is both excellent at lengthening and/or filling out my lashes, AND does not go on clumpy or goopy.  I haven&#x27;t found it.  So I went back to this mascara, which I&#x27;ve used before.  This mascara does an OK job of lengthening my lashes a little, it goes on easily, and it is not clumpy or goopy - it requires very little or even no use of a lash separator, and less &amp;#34;clean-up&amp;#34; of stray marks after application than other mascaras.  It also does not flake off during the day as much as some other mascaras, or accumulate under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, this mascara is not amazing, but it is my go-to for everyday easy low-maintenance wear.  I&#x27;ve tried other more expensive mascaras and been disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great prodcut, not too heavy or too light, pretty much water proof. just the right amount of accentuation--not obnoxious lashes.</li>
    <li> For me this didn&#x27;t work out. I have very thin, fine, short lashes, &amp; the brush didn&#x27;t carry enough mascara on  it to grab my lashes.  I would poke my eyelid, my eyes would water, &amp; itch for hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, the reason I tried this mascara was because of the people who stood by it!</li>
    <li> The best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used in 40 years - and I&#x27;ve paid top dollar to drug store prices for all kinds of products. I like the length and the ease of application avoiding clumps. Wonderful. I have regular lashes, not full, not thin, and decent natural length. This looks great.</li>
    <li> I am absolutely in love with this product! Best one out there. If yiu don&#x27;t believe me, try it! Each of my lashes is delicately separated. The brush is super flexible and it is great for an every day look. I have tried several covergirl mascaras and this one is the best one so far. The best part of this is that it comes of very easily with your make-up remover. I&#x27;ve been using this product since it first came out and people keep asking me if I wear fake eyelashes.  It satisfied me.</li>
    <li> Finally, a reasonably priced mascara that doesn&#x27;t clump even with multiple coats! And stays on even after a good cry!</li>
    <li> This is the best drugstore brand mascara I&#x27;ve ever had. No clumps, with 2 or 3 coats you will look like you have fake lashes. HIGHLY recommend, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> This mascara does not clump and makes your lashes seem longer and thicker. It is very pleasing to me.</li>
    <li> LOVE this mascara.  covers well, thick without clumping.  Great coverage, lasts long and through tears, sweat and rubbing.  Only kind of mascara I buy! WORTH IT!</li>
    <li> Sometimes this can be a little clumpy when applied, but generally it seems to work well and doesn&#x27;t come off during the day. It&#x27;s a nice affordable mascara, makes my lashes long, and looks great. A little goes a long way and it seems to last for a long time.</li>
    <li> Perfect for daytime--separates without clumping.  Imagine that?  It is a soft, black color that sits lightly upon the eye.  Almost like a feather.</li>
    <li> Made my skin on face break out in rash while no other product ever has</li>
    <li> Just as the name states... no clumps!  I thought I would try something new and I really like this mascara.  It makes my eyelashes look long and there is no clumping.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Covergirl mascaras for many years, always with great satisfaction.  When I worked outside for years, I wore their waterproof formula.  Now, I&#x27;ve started to use this water resistant version.  I like its easy application, good wear, and easy removal.  It is not waterproof, so look for that if you want to wear your mascara outside in high humidity or rain.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara, it really is clump free and I am a fan of this wand style.</li>
    <li> Really like this mascara.  It goes on really well.  Truly does not clump!  lengthens lashes and last all day.  Does not rub off and washes off very easily.</li>
    <li> This mascara is my favorite mascara because it leaves no clumps on my eye lashes. The mascara is water resistant and do not smudge. It makes my eye lashes look much fuller and longer. I always buy the black brown color because I love the way it looks on my lashes. The brush is so soft and nice with a curve design to it that will separate your lashes while evenly distributing your mascara on your eye lashes . This mascara is suited for all ages, so don&#x27;t hesitate and give it a try.</li>
    <li> Okay, so the ads for this stuff are insane. It&#x27;s mascara, for goodness&#x27; sake. But it is clump free. I really, really hate clumpy mascara and had resorted to only using travel/sample sized ones, since even the nice stuff gets spidery and clumpy and horrible so fast. I&#x27;ve had this stuff for a month or two, and it&#x27;s great! Doesn&#x27;t clump at all. It also doesn&#x27;t lengthen or thicken or whatever. I had always considered those promises to mostly be hooey -- it&#x27;s paint you put on your lashes, maybe gooey paint that makes things look thicker, or maybe with some fibers in there, it&#x27;s not a magic wand -- but, yeah, this stuff isn&#x27;t very thick. My not-super-impressive lashes look the same, just darker. If I had the choice between goopy, clumped together lashes that look slightly thicker or pretty, natural-but-better-looking lashes, I&#x27;d take the latter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So -- recommended! I can&#x27;t promise that you&#x27;ll turn into some intense punk rock goddess as the commercials suggest, but you&#x27;ll look nice with un-clumpy lashes.</li>
    <li> I liked this mascara, but it did make my eyelids a bit sensitive.</li>
    <li> The mascara works fine and seems to be water resistant as advertised. The brush is sort of clunky and hard to use though, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying again.</li>
    <li> I actually liked this mascara and it doesn&#x27;t clump up.  Makes my lashes longer and more defined without looking clumpy.</li>
    <li> It is okay, but I do not have good enough eyelashes to judge. I put a lot on and it does not clump, so I guess it is what is says it is.</li>
    <li> I had no intentions of loving this I bought it because it was on sale and I needed a quick mascara fix. I am so glad I ran out of my go to mascara because now I have a new everyday make up staple. My lashses look phenomenal. It dries quickly for excellent layering which is what I need for my lashes to pop. I don&#x27;t wear false lashes but this mascara elongated and separated my lashes to make them more defined and dramatic but not the oo much for a professional office setting. I have the water resistant very black shade and I love it on my black lashes. I&#x27;ll be ordering a stockpile this is the first department store brand mascara I love!</li>
    <li> I think that these may have been sitting on a shelf for awhile, because they flake like crazy.</li>
    <li> After seeing this mascara well-reviewed on several sites I decided to give it a try.  I was disappointed from the first day I tried it.  It was actually very clumpy so I bought a lash comb to separate the clumps.  It was very difficult to break up the clumps and once I did I was left with a very \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; look to my lashes after a single application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second reason I have decided to leave such a low rated review is the amount of &#x27;debris&#x27; that fell from the mascara thru-out the day.  Several times I had to use a wet tissue to clean up fibers that had fallen on my cheeks.  Worst of all....my glasses actually made it look more prominent that it actually was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*sigh*&lt;br /&gt;The search continues.  Anyone know of a good &#x27;color only&#x27; mascara without all the fibers needed to make lashes longer/fuller/etc?</li>
    <li> I always love Covergirl mascara. It stays on for a long time and it always goes on easily and manages to be the perfect thickness. Really happy with the lighter brown color, too!</li>
    <li> I really like this mascara. It adds fullness and length to my lashes to such an extent that it almost looks like I have false eyelashes ! For me, though, it does flake by the end of the day, and I have little black \\&quot;dandruff \\&quot; under my eyes every evening.</li>
    <li> Does not smudge under lower lash line, which is important for me</li>
    <li> Works great! Happy with purchase!</li>
    <li> This is as good as the hype says it is!  I have it in brown.  I prefer a natural look from mascara and this does the job! It makes my lashes look darker and a bit thicker, but they still look like my lashes, not like a weird spider or a set of falsies. It also washes off easily, and the price is great. Unless something magical comes along, I will rebuy this mascara over and over!</li>
    <li> I have really long lashes that need more color on the ends. This mascara is just right for me. The consistency was a bit watery like I prefer and the applicator worked well. I applied this after curling my lashes and there was no clumping or smearing. It lasted all day without irritating my sensitive eyes and never flaked off onto my glasses like many mascaras do. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Doesn&#x27;t clump up like the others do.  Goes on easy. I have been using it for a few years now.  I like light mascara and not heavy and this one does the trick perfectly.  You can put more coats on and make it thicker for evening. Comes off easy at night, but doesn&#x27;t leave dark circles under my eyes during the day.</li>
