<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This electric toothbrush is amazingly good for the price. I had one of the expensive electric toothbrushes years ago and I don&#x27;t think it was any more effective then this very economical toothbrush. Do you really need a toothbrush to have a timer to tell you to switch to a different part of your mouth. That seems like the only difference between this one and the expensive (over $100) brush. Oh yea, the other one had a built in rechargeable battery and it&#x27;s own docking station. I just use two AA rechargeable batteries in this toothbrush and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes, I use this brush with a little baking soda and wow, my teeth are sooooo clean. They feel the way they feel after a dentist visit. I&#x27;m a person who takes time to take care of my teeth. I highly recommend this brush.</li>
    <li> I like the feel of the brush head it is not to big for my month. thought I would need to change the battery often but not so.  I brush twice a daily.  My teeth feel great and it also travels well.  Well worth the price I paid.</li>
    <li> An excellent toothbrush value, high quality results at a very good price.  You and your teeth and gums will be happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Loud and really too big for someone&#x27;s mouth</li>
    <li> Ordered it for my daughter, a teal tooth brush was pictured, received a blue colored one, she was bummed.</li>
    <li> I keep buying these because they work great, and now my other family members want one too!  Very nice</li>
    <li> I prefer this design to the normal bulky and weak tooth brushes.</li>
    <li> I have been using this toothbrush for years, but every few years I do buy a new one because like ANY toothbrush, they get a little crusty here and there. Who wants that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was shocked to read on Oral B&#x27;s site (which won&#x27;t let me register to leave a good review) all the bad reviews. First, I have no idea if it whitens or not, I just like the brush and the complete action and cross action heads both fit either model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will address complains on Oral B&#x27;s site, in case someone has these questions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The head is hard to remove and you are not given a tool: It&#x27;s confusing at first, but read the picture directions and it&#x27;s easy. There is at tool provided and you get a new tool every time you buy new heads. The tool has a little knob on it that fits into a tiny hole at the base of the brush head/top of the neck. You press that in there and it pops the head up, then you pull the head off and simply snap the new one one. EASY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Someone said they took the head off their sons brush and it had mold. I&#x27;ve used this for years, I change my head about every 2 - 3 months because I brush hard, my folks change less often because they don&#x27;t wear out heads like I do, and I have never seen mold, mildew, or anything. Once in a while a little toothpaste build up, I do run it under hot water though before putting on a new head. I also rinse it before and after I brush really well. I also had my brush in a sanitize unit for years that gets warm and dries your brush, but it has died, they no longer sell it, so I plan to to use the snap on ones and hang it up right on the wall so it can dry properly. However, on vacations, I&#x27;ve left it laying all over the place for up to 2 weeks and never found mold!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. I read batteries fail quickly. Nope. Nobody in my family has had battery problems, the probably last a good 6 + months before it starts to slow down to the point where you need to pop in 2 more. I&#x27;d say, I change my batteries max, 3 times a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a great toothbrush. It keeps my teach very clean, nothing ever left over in there! I also currently have braces on (yes, I&#x27;m an adult) and my dentist always remarks on I am the only person who comes in with clean braces. Granted, most people that she sees with braces are well under my age and probably don&#x27;t brush like they should, but still, I think a manual brush would not do nearly as well in the all the little crevices that come with braces and wires and bands that the electric one can do. I used the brush before I had braces also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this for price and quality.a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a great toothbrush. It keeps my teach very clean, nothing ever left over in there! I also currently have braces on (yes, I&#x27;m an adult) and my dentist always remarks on I am the only person who comes in with clean braces. Granted, most people that she sees with braces are well under my age and probably don&#x27;t brush like they should, but still, I think a manual brush would not do nearly as well in the all the little crevices that come with braces and wires and bands that the electric one can do. I used the brush before I had braces also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this for price and quality.</li>
    <li> This is my first powered toothbrush and I&#x27;m pleased that I bought it.  It has good action and is comfortable to hold.  I&#x27;ve used it for quite some time now and the battery still seems strong.  It&#x27;s light and well balanced.  My only complaint is that I thought the round area of the head bristles rotated and it does not; it only articulates up and down.</li>
    <li> Great value and I&#x27;m working on over a month with excellent wear on head and the battery is still strong. The trick as well is use light pressure against your teeth and let the paste and brush vibrations do the work. I have bad gums and this is actually bring them back some as I think with my manual I was brushing too hard !</li>
    <li> great product. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Its like having a vibrator in your mouth with bristles!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see NO benefit in this product! Its like having a vibrating razor! WHY? Or a vibrating spoon or fork! WHY?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It detracts from your normal brushing pressure  and method because of its size the bristles (on this model) and the vibrating (again why?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bristles dont move they just....vibrate.....WHY?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah its only 5 bucks,but WHY WOULD YOU SPEND even $2 on this? WHY?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMO a regular brush is MUCH MORE efficient and effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why would anyone buy additional brush heads and batteries to keep this running? WHY?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love tech (this is old &amp;#34;tech&amp;#34;) and it has no place on the market. Its like bacon toothpaste its a NOVELTY!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT ME (and I will) a good charcoal toothbrush instead of this piece of un-usefulness&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUY IT BUT YOULL JUST BE THROWING AWAY $5!!</li>
    <li> Nice / good quality.......... better than a hand brush......</li>
    <li> the brush head wears out faster than i expect</li>
    <li> Inexpensive and works great.</li>
    <li> So pefect for travelling</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite things!  I do not go without it.  It lasts a long time, cleans stains off and is gentle at the same time.  I don&#x27;t care for the more expensive electric toothbrushes, this is my go to.</li>
    <li> Good product as described.</li>
    <li> One of the best in the market.</li>
    <li> GREAT LOVE IT DELIVERED AS PROMISED.  BEEN USING THEM FOR YEARS I AND MY DENTIST LOVE THEM</li>
    <li> its okay for the price. Battery ran out very fast. Actually you need to replace the battery soon because its speed gets slowed down after 1-2 weeks.  I ll prefer chargeable ones over battery operated ones. But again what else could you expect for  $5 ;)</li>
    <li> Nice one! My teeth can&#x27;t be cleaner.</li>
    <li> Works good. A convenient item when travelling.</li>
    <li> Insanely loud. Like crazy loud!! But teeth feel polished so that good. I think I&#x27;ll have to brush my teeth outside with it so I don&#x27;t wake up the whole house.</li>
    <li> Teeth feel so clean after use, smooth and shiny.  Is a good product that does the job.</li>
    <li> The brush is too big for the mouth. It works but not vry strong. Buy it if you have a BIG MOUTH</li>
    <li> Oddly, there is no information on the packaging regarding the bristle strength.  I only use extra soft or soft so I&#x27;ll keep this around for an overnight guest.</li>
    <li> Solid value and lasts a long time. Last one I had for 3-4 years (changing the toothbrush tip periodically of course). Dentist has not complaints.</li>
    <li> This tooth brush is great and gives you a very nice brushing.  I like everything about it and I got it for under 3 dollars from amazon with a coupon.  I just wish the replacement heads were cheap.</li>
    <li> I was never fan of spending money on things I dont really need until I realized how much benefit this can do to your oral hygiene. Saved me lots of money by going to dentist once a year instead of twice to get check up.My first electrical toothbrush. This product inspired me to get a Sonicare rechargeable/replaceable heads one which was the next step. It lasted over 8 months with the battery it came with. Good for starter and great for messy kids. If you dont want to buy expensive toothbrush. This is the one you  want trust me. its works very well compare to manual brush.</li>
    <li> Great, works like a champ.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement for older brush of same model that I have used for years. teeth feel cleaner and gums measure tighter. A winner for me.</li>
    <li> Comfortable and easy to use. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
    <li> These are great toothbrushes really...</li>
    <li> Been using this toothbrush for a while and I keep buying more.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing power toothbrush that is very affordable. I love it. My wife and I as well as our son are using this toothbrush now. Powerful and it seems the batteries never wear out. (They will, we just haven&#x27;t experienced it yet.)</li>
    <li> LOVE this toothbrush.  I am actually surprised how much I liked this toothbrush.  Some toothbrushes that cost just as much only vibrate.  This toothbrush has all the motions and I really felt that my teeth were clean.  I was wanting an expensive rechargeable toothbrush, but I have such a small bathroom and only 1 outlet.  This toothbrush was perfect.  I accidentally dropped this in the toilet, so I had to replace it but bought the wrong kind.  I need to order another one of these!</li>
    <li> Great portable and useful to have</li>
    <li> Love these!!!!  We buy these about every 3 months and throw the old ones out. When they only cost about $5 a piece, feels like a good deal.  Haven&#x27;t had any problems with cavities since using these for the past 5 years.</li>
    <li> A great toothbrush. It&#x27;s powerful and your teeth are going to thank you</li>
    <li> Excellent brush for travel. The battery chamber screws into place so that you never have a leak no matter how many times you change batteries. The other battery powered one Oral B has cracks quickly allowing water to enter the battery chamber. After about the third time you change batteries on the press on base, the base cracks. Then the whole unit is useless. The screw on closure for the battery is much more secure and easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;The only part of this unit that I would change is the design of the brush head. I would much prefer a brush with just one section.&lt;br /&gt;It would also be nice if the replacement head just slipped onto the unit.&lt;br /&gt;However, what has won me over is the security of the battery chamber. It is far superior to the press on closure.</li>
    <li> excellent product,received in excellent conditions higly recommended if u want to give it for a gift its perfect ,i  love this brush.Higly recommended</li>
    <li> Excellent product that help keep your teeth clean and avoid infection.  Brushes have to be change often though if you like hard brushing.  However, I alternate brushes and reused them two or three times after.</li>
    <li> I bought one at a local dollar store. It seems to be nice and powerful. I think it must be disposable. I am not sure the head is replaceable.</li>
    <li> Wonderful toothbrush-very comfortable to use. Really feel my teeth are at their cleanest after every use.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Oral-B 3d White Action Power toothbrush because the electronic toothbrushes at CVS/ Walgreens are too expensive.  I found them to be a lot cheaper on amazon.  This toothbrush is okay, it was a lot larger than expectedtherefore it&#x27;s harder to get into those hard to reach places.  The head is a bit on the smaller side.  The toothbrush almost feels like it should be for a kid.  Overall it gets the job done, but when I need a replacement I will most likely try another brand/style.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Oral-B prowhite rechargeable toothbrush for years, but after buying 3 of the newer version of the toothbrush, I&#x27;ve given up on it since they all burned out so quickly.  Now I&#x27;ve started using this toothbrush.  While it doesn&#x27;t have a timer, I&#x27;m willing to &amp;#34;put up&amp;#34; with it since it has lasted longer than the other Oral-Bs.</li>
    <li> Took this with me on a trip and it was great. Not as sophisticated as my home unit but I wouldn&#x27;t be upset if I lost this one.</li>
    <li> This is a great battery powered toothbrush.  I use it while traveling because it&#x27;s just a tad bit larger than a regular toothbrush, and packs nicely.</li>
    <li> This, is, ahhh mazing! It feels great, it lasts months, and if you want to replace it earlier then you could probably buy a new one for the change in the couch. I would recommend buying the rechargeable one with extra heads if it&#x27;s available.</li>
    <li> great，my friends love them. that make teeth so clean.</li>
    <li> i get this on subscribe and save... it is a decent product&lt;br /&gt;i feel it does a better job than a manual toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;and one CAN purchase replacement heads&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i like it-- feels good to massage the gums as well</li>
    <li> heavy because of the battery but very forceful brush, which i like</li>
    <li> Great for my teenagers.</li>
    <li> Excellent!  I was worried it might not be powerful enough with the batteries,  but it is very powerful.  My teeth feel just out of the dentist clean every day!  Plus, easy to take with you on trip!  Highly recommend it!  Hubby loves his too!</li>
    <li> I believe this toothbrush used to be labeled a Cross Action Battery Operated Toothbrush. Well, I found it again under another name and I continue to love it. I change the head and battery regularly. I get good reviews from my dental hygenist. I do recommend this product. It is worthwhile to shop online for price, however.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! Works great and I do think it has whitened my teeth. Really quick and easy to use. I like how compact it is!</li>
    <li> This is the second Oral-B 3d toothbrush I buy and that it stops working within 1-2months. I would expect better quality from Oral B, products.</li>
    <li> I finally decided that I would switch to a battery powered toothbrush. I don&#x27;t think I will ever go back to manually brushing my teeth anymore. I love that it comes with a toothbrush protector - cap thing.</li>
    <li> Well its a toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used one of these for years and it works great, but I&#x27;m going to switch to something else because the last several replacement brushes I&#x27;ve gotten have a problem: The bristles come off while I&#x27;m brushing. i don&#x27;t like having loose bristles in my mouth. This didn&#x27;t happen when I first got the brush a few years ago, but it&#x27;s happening with every replacement brush now.</li>
    <li> Got it right on time. The battery literally last for 3 weeks. I hardly ever have to charge it and it&#x27;s easy to find here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I like this brush very much. I use rechargeable batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;It is having enough power&lt;br /&gt;Sleek design&lt;br /&gt;best for travel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Nothing major&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would appreciate if 2 min timer was included in this. It&#x27;s in the next model though</li>
    <li> Pretty nice for the price, but the back of the brush has a strange taste when i am using it. Kind of metallic even though it is plastic</li>
    <li> My wife love it, she brushes more now because she likes the feel and the results.</li>
    <li> Got this on sale for a great price.  I don&#x27;t know how long it will last but it&#x27;s been good so far.  I wanted a cheap electric toot brush and that&#x27;s exactly what I got (in a good way).</li>
    <li> I would definitely recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Does a great job of cleaning the teeth!&lt;br /&gt;2.  Easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;3.  Better than other brands of power brushes I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
    <li> I am so glad I purchased this toothbrush. It cleans good, feels good in your mouth. A very good buy! dj</li>
    <li> This is a replacement toothbrush. I have been using it for the past 5 plus years, and its a great brush.  never have problems with it, just change the brush and the battery and they just keep going.</li>
    <li> I have used a competitor&#x27;s battery-powered toothbrush (one that spins) for over 10 years - thought it was great, UNTIL NOW!!  I was feeling spontaneous the other day and bought this one (what a rebel, huh?!? - lol).  Anyhow, when I first went to use it I was leery because it doesn&#x27;t spin like the other one that I used forever.  But I am so incredibly impressed - my teeth don&#x27;t even feel this clean and smooth when I leave the dentist!!  They were even porcelain smooth the next morning!  I am NEVER going back to the other brand.  The other great thing is that this one is less expensive than the other one.</li>
    <li> I thought this was rechargeable, but found out it takes a AA battery.  I almost returned it; however, the battery seems to last a long long time, so I&#x27;m very happy about it.  Plus, no charger cord on my counter!  The toothbrush works very good.  Not quite a &amp;#34;Sonicare&amp;#34;, but I got so tired of buying those expensive replacement heads, that I&#x27;m satisfied reducing the quality a bit to save a lot more money!  For the money, its a five star purchase for sure!  You really can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
    <li> The price is so cheap, and the brush works great.  Wanted it for trips, I have been absolutely pleased with the product.&lt;br /&gt;Good buy, not disappointed.</li>
    <li> replacing the heads is easy and the pulsing is powerful. I recommend popping in a lithium battery, as that will boost the power substantially.</li>
    <li> Grabbed this when it went on sale (with a coupon) and I can almost solemnly swear not to go back to regular brushing. This is my first battery powered brush and it has exceeded expectations. Leaves your mouth feeling cleaner and fresher if you brush for the recommended time. The head rotates, which is great, but now I have to buy replacement heads, which I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll find somewhere!</li>
    <li> great powerful toothbrush--uses one AA battery-- a little noisy--but fine</li>
    <li> product as described--</li>
    <li> a bargain! and it feels like it&#x27;s doing a world of good. i have one for am, one for pm.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is still working and hasn&#x27;t needed new batteries yet.  It&#x27;s waterproof.  I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> The head is not curved at all, it is straight, and does not bend. It makes it harder to use than a normal tooth brush.</li>
    <li> I paid less than $2 for this one and it&#x27;s obviously wayyyyyyyyyy more value than what I paid for it.Nothing to complain for a power brush on short trip.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is so powerful and my&lt;br /&gt;mouth feels so clean after brushing with it!&lt;br /&gt;This is a great choice for an &amp;#34;electric&amp;#34; toothbrush!</li>
    <li> I use only this toothbrush, it&#x27;s just great. I don&#x27; usually change battery, just buy the new one when they get old</li>
    <li> A true value for money product that does not rip you off. No more plague problems now in the hard to reach nooks and crannies.</li>
    <li> I switched over to electric in the early 90&#x27;s, defected to sonic for the life of the product, went back to basics of the oral-b lineup, converted to battery last year, and this one is truly different since the sonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oral-b&#x27;s lineup is always confusing since the constant battle with the sonic camp.  And they can&#x27;t promote this little guy as the next break through, and that it cleans as good as it&#x27;s top of the range.  I don&#x27;t blame them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read some typical medical research of opposing camps on a .gov website.  Their purpose is to make sure that you can&#x27;t pick anyone base on their trial results.  But what didn&#x27;t say is that you will get there at the end no matter what.  And somewhere else mention that flossing will be the equalizer.  I had a cheap oral-b flossier easier to use than a toothpick.  You don&#x27;t need very powerful and expensive gadgets to get there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The basic design of the oral-b never changed in 25 years, other than it&#x27;s own sonic branch.  It&#x27;s rotating back and forth or so called oscillating.  That&#x27;s why I went back to basics because they are not that different. I tried the battery version last year based on the good reviews.  I can&#x27;t believe that the price is about half than the \\&quot;rechargeable\\&quot; version but it&#x27;s better in many ways.  You can have a fresh pair of rechargeable battery when you want for cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The advance in magnets, hence small motors, and battery technology made expensive toothbrush obsolete.  That&#x27;s why last time I looked, there were a lot of similar battery toothbrush and compatible brush heads all for a few dollars. I picked up one that is good, but the hard plastic slide switch is a dog.  Sometimes I have a hard time to turn on the brush when my hands are wet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t pick up this one because it looked like the older disposable electric toothbrush for kids, which were bad in too many ways.  Based on the reviews, I tried this to replace my can&#x27;t-turn-on-with-wet-fingers power toothbrush.  This is not sonic, not oscillating, but vibrates side to side.  I think it benefits from the mobile phone technology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it vibrates faster than oscillating, share some characteristics with sonic but at a fraction of the price.  I think the seal that separates the head from the electric part is at a near stationary point.  And that there&#x27;s no turning part might make the brush longer lasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vibration is quite powerful, at least the sound of it.  Somebody complained that it&#x27;s loud.  I would say the user switches from manual.  If you are currently an electric user, it&#x27;s not bad, just that the pitch may be higher.  It is far from the noise of the 1st sonic model from Philips.  On power I felt that it is as good as the oral-b one using two batteries.  I will be surprised if I didn&#x27;t read the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The use of a single battery creates many design opportunities.  It looks nice. It&#x27;s easy to change the battery.  Also the sealed rocker switch typical of oral-b is best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would think the vibration will be better for small kids, if they can make it quieter.  There is no timer for kids.rush.  This is not sonic, not oscillating, but vibrates side to side.

    <li> Seems better than my manual toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;Also managed to buy the replacement heads for 2 for $1 through amazon coupons</li>
    <li> quick and as described</li>
    <li> Great power toothbrush for travel..</li>
    <li> On time delivery and good cleaning of the teeth</li>
    <li> This is the first electric toothbrush I have ever owned. The brushing seems powerful enough, no problems yet. Changing the battery was easy but I haven&#x27;t tried replacing the head. Honestly though, at this price, I&#x27;d probably just buy a whole new one than replacable heads.</li>
    <li> My teeth feel extra clean after using.</li>
    <li> Mixed feelings on this one. I&#x27;ve been using it for quite a few years now. I like how it works, when it works. It&#x27;s just that the brush heads and the brush itself wears out a lot quicker than I like. I generally have to change the heads once a month or so. What happens is while that the bristles themselves aren&#x27;t really worn down at that point, the head itself loses its back and forth rotation. It might \\&quot;appear\\&quot; to be still be turning, but check it in the mirror when there is pressure on it, i.e. against your teeth and gums, or test it against your fingernail, and you&#x27;ll see when it&#x27;s no longer effective. At that point, it&#x27;s just basically vibrating in your mouth without cleaning anything. Folks who use this regularly should check for this. It took me a while to realize that after a month or so, I was merely pretending to brush my teeth but not really cleaning anything. Also, once the head wears, the seam/gap between the main piece and the rotating brush part loosens and widens quite a bit and pinches the insides of your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush itself tends to wear out after about 4 to 5 months, where once again it still \\&quot;appears\\&quot; to be working, but if you check carefully, you&#x27;ll find that even if you put a new head in there, the rotating properties diminish greatly. I think the inner mechanism simply wears out by then, and no longer connects and moves the brush head as well. Yes, once again, let&#x27;s all thank corporate America for \\&quot;Planned Obsolescence\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use Sonic Care. The $125 model I bought was good, but no longer held a charge after 2 years. How convenient for Sonic Care. Then I tried their battery operated $40 model, which worked OK but had a really stupidly designed battery cap which allowed water to flow into the compartment. Wow, that&#x27;s TITANICALLY STUPID!!! Anyway, found this and works OK ... and have been using it since. However, not without the stated reservations. If one were to change the brush and brush heads as often as necessary (which I do), it&#x27;s not really all that cheap to use. It&#x27;s actually pretty expensive to use. About 10 to 12 heads and 2 or 3 brushes a year. Do the math. If I find a better alternative, I&#x27;ll switch without too much nostalgia, ha ha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I do want to state that my brushing routine is probably a lot more thorough and longer than most (about 5 minutes per session), so others may get a longer \\&quot;effective life\\&quot; than I get. But still, can&#x27;t imagine their recommendation of changing the heads every 3 months being adequate. Folks who use this really should monitor the \\&quot;TRUE effective life\\&quot; of their brushes and heads, otherwise you might \\&quot;think\\&quot; you&#x27;re brushing your teeth, but might actually be doing nothing to effectively \\&quot;clean\\&quot; them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this is helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheersit&#x27;s not really all that cheap to use.

    <li> Love these babies. The head is small enough for a 5&#x27;9\\&quot; man to access his back teeth, The single AA battery has plenty of power and minimizes the electrical contacts. I bought the Oral-B Pro-Health CrossAction 7 Toothbrush Soft Bristles, (Colors May Vary) (Pack of 4) for $14, although it looks like this may get posted on another offering for the same brush individually. At my price, this was a no-brainer!</li>
    <li> My entire family uses this and they work just fine.  Pretty durable too, easily last you a couple of years.  The replacement is also easy to find here on amazon.  Cheap enough to replace every other year.  Overall, we like it.</li>
    <li> Love these things, and about the price of replacement heads for one with a nice new strong motor again.  My last one lasted about 15 months before water started getting into the battery compartment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downside, I wish you could choose a color.  I got purple (which is fine) but other people in my family have the same color.</li>
    <li> The Oral-B 3D White Action Power Toothbrush cleans a whole lot better than the old plugin Oral-B Sonic Complete toothbrush that I had for over 5 years. The replacements for this toothbrush isn&#x27;t too pricey. As for batteries, you can save some money if you get batteries that recharge. The batteries actually last for a long time since I&#x27;ve gotten it.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I received around July 30th, and the batteries haven&#x27;t been replaced since.</li>
    <li> Very good for the price.  My daughter likes it and her dentist praised her teeth cleaning.  Will recommend to parents.</li>
    <li> It is TOOOOOOOOO noisy!!! Everytime when I am using it, my roomate thinks I am shaving.</li>
    <li> Cheap but good. I like it so far</li>
    <li> My GF says it is too bulky and too big for her mouth. She also says she can&#x27;t stick it in her mouth and do something else w/ her hands.</li>
    <li> Amazon ... please don&#x27;t ever stop selling this toothbrush and the refills that go with it.  Had tried so many others by Oral B and other makers and this one stands out as the best.</li>
    <li> Great price and product.</li>
    <li> I bought this as the price was cheaper. This is a good toothbrush for a cheaper price. I recommend this to use.</li>
    <li> Perfectly cleans my pearly whites!</li>
    <li> good .but noisy.haha. battery can used for 2 months.</li>
    <li> I am amazed by this inexpensive electric toothbrush.  It works well, cleans thoroughly, and is a good deal money-wise.</li>
    <li> A+++++ excellent product, excellent program for cleaning teeth.</li>
    <li> Saw several of these single battery power tooth brushes over the years. All proved to be useless gimmick devices. Not this one! This Oral B model is better than the Water Pik model. What can I say? The Oral-B is clearly superior to manual bushing. A con for me is I am surprised by how loud it is!</li>
    <li> Best motorized toothbrush under 20 bucks.  I use this toothbrush with my Arm and Hammer complete care toothbrush for cavity free check ups.</li>
    <li> Good Product, Fast Delivery. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> For the price, acceptable quality.  Wish the head was little smaller to get into smaller spaces.</li>
    <li> I just started using it today. Found that even after changing batteries and switching on power toothbrush part does not work.&lt;br /&gt;Need to call Amazon and requested them to take it back now..</li>
    <li> I love this because it&#x27;s slimmer than other battery operated brushes.</li>
    <li> I still have the base unit and ordered the toothbrushes as a replacement...just in case they become unavailable. II have been using this type of Oral B rechargeable toothbrush for about 5 years now. Great toothbrush...will hold charge for about 7 to 10 days while on vacation so you don&#x27;t have to take the entire unit. Handy replacement brushes are available on Amazon. Great product!</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my previous same exact product, and so far, so good. The previous product&#x27;s motor stopped working in less than a year. Otherwise I like this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Omg hate this toothbrush. Makes me drool everywhere because there is a hole where the replaceable brush heads get attached and I can not get a good drool-preventing seal around the shaft of this stupid brush (unless I tip my head back 45 degrees while brushing, lol, ugh) Poor design. Could maybe function as a vibrator because it does have a good strong vibration action, but it&#x27;s actually heading straight for the garbage can. I&#x27;ll be trading up for a quality Philips brush next time Costco has them on special.</li>
    <li> Use a regular traditional toothbrush or spend the money for a sonicare. This was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Brushes stop spinning with the slightest pressure. It&#x27;s just a loud manual toothbrush. Going to spend the extra money and  purchase a Sonicare since I&#x27;ve heard so much about them.</li>
    <li> I bought these years ago for my kids after a recommendation from the dentist. I decided to buy one for myself. The replacement heads can be bought here or at your local Walmart. I recommend these highly as they get the job done.</li>
    <li> Great brush, works well, batteries seem to last for a while in them.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think for the price that it would be a good toothbrush but it is. I love it and works great. Not sure why there is bad reviews but mine works great</li>
    <li> I chose this because it was cheap,  I like it because one battery last a very long time. there are no cons in opinion.</li>
    <li> One of the best toothbrushes with a large head. It also takes an AA battery so you do not have to charge it constantly (the charger also takes much space)</li>
    <li> This was not what I was expecting to get, although that was my mistake.  I gave it to my mom to replace her&#x27;s identical to this, but hers was not battery operated.  She absolutely loves it.</li>
    <li> This is a very good purchase if you think of it as a quasidispossible. The cost of replacement heads is high in relationship to the initial cost. I have seen generic heads for less and if you go that route it is a super deal. I think it is especially good for trips.</li>
    <li> These are difficult to find in the store and I have been using these battery operated toothbrushes for years. They are a great product and I cannot do without them so I need to stock up a few of them even though they do not go bad at all. I have been using the same one for years and so has my family. Only one of them recently stopped working.</li>
    <li> Cheap, can be used abroad, brush speed too hight and a little bit noisy. Overall pleased with quality. Simple great toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Out of all the cross action Oral B brushes that I have bought they have all come with plastic covers for the brush this toothbrush did not.</li>
    <li> look good. have not used yet</li>
    <li> The vibrating sound is so loud....</li>
    <li> I like this toothbrush because it is lightweight, slender and easy to reach and brush all my teeth with&lt;br /&gt;little effort.  The charging holder is small and doesn&#x27;t take up much room on my countertop and the&lt;br /&gt;cost is reasonable</li>
    <li> Third one and they work great</li>
    <li> Good product at good price</li>
    <li> Very good , have been using one for last 6 years :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my Oral-B battery-operated toothbrush for more than three years now and I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied. I brush my teeth four times a day and take a lot of time doing it. The toothbrush itself seems almost indestructible and I only have to replace the battery every month or so at most. (It takes a single double-A battery.) Because it&#x27;s cordless I don&#x27;t have to worry about recharging it or taking along the charger when I go on a trip. I find that a head lasts about three months before the bristles begin to wear out. (Changing the head is extremely easy and takes a fraction of a minute.) The convenience and reliability is amazing.</li>
    <li> The White Power Toothbrush, brought to you by Donald Trump 2016. Most aryan toothbrush on the market.</li>
    <li> Piece of junk.  Worked for 3 months.  Then the top portion of the brush stopped spinning.  I replaced the battery and the brush head.  Still the top portion of the brush doesn&#x27;t spin.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the first time I try an electric toothbrush. It didn&#x27;t let me down!</li>
    <li> Works perfectly and really helps with the plaque</li>
    <li> Before buying the Oral-B battery toothbrush I used manual toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I started using this brush I fell in love with it. The design of the brush makes it very easy to have a grip around it. It is very powerful and it requires only one battery. The replacement heads are not very costly and are easily available in stores. After using the brush my teeth is cleaner and feels like I have cleaned them professionally. The brush has two buttons for turning it ON and OFF, which is sometimes difficult to keep in mind. The off button is very small and many times I have pressed the ON button to turn the brush off they I remember the lower button is the one that turns the brush OFF.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product for the people who do not want to spend a lot of money for cleaning their teeth regularly and want a better cleaning than a manual brush can do.</li>
    <li> excellent toothbrush!!</li>
    <li> Bristles are not too soft and not too firm, just right. Easy to hold handle, not too bulky. Cover cap is efficient.</li>
    <li> Have been very pleased with this product. The battery lasts a very long time. Comfortable to use and convenient for travel.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t know anything about the technology that goes into these toothbrushes, but of the three or four that I&#x27;ve previously owned, this one is the best! It leaves your teeth feeling clean all day long, even after you&#x27;ve eaten, and can&#x27;t brush your teeth until later. Really good buy!</li>
    <li> A vert simple a&amp; easy to use tooth electric brush. Good when thinking of trying for electric tooth brushes. Cleans very good.&lt;br /&gt;Very convenient.</li>
    <li> I thought that the wheel in the head of the brush rotated 360 degrees, but it just oscillates 1 or 2 degrees. The oscillations stop when you put some pressure on the brush against the teeth, but you do not realize because the \\&quot;vibrations\\&quot; are still there and make you think that the brush is still rubbing the teeth. I do not think that using this brush can be better than a manual brush, unless you use it in the same way as you would use the manual one.</li>
    <li> It works well for the price.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Runs on a single replaceable AA battery.  Very inexpensive compared to some electric toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> What more can I say? It works and it was pretty cheap price.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s little noisy but I can live with that.&lt;br /&gt;I can also replace battery w/ rechargerble.&lt;br /&gt;Only downside is that refills are expensive. (but that&#x27;s same for alomost all motorized toothbrush)</li>
    <li> Great product and my daughter loves it!</li>
    <li> The things I do not like about this toothbrush greatly outweigh the positives. The one thing I do like about it is the design; it is slim and compact, and you can replace the battery and heads, reducing waste. The quality of the clean is decent, but nothing I would rave about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problems I have with the brush are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The motor is way too loud. I had to get another brush because it drove me nuts. I have used the Pulsar which is also by Oral-B, and it is much more quiet. I assumed they would have the same, or similar motors, but that is clearly not the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The circular head is a little deceiving. Though it doesn&#x27;t say it does, the head does not spin 360 degrees. In fact, it barely spins 5 degrees. If you look at it while vibrating, it looks as if the only movement is caused by the vibration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It would have been nice to have a flat bottom on the brush so it could stand on its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankly, I&#x27;m baffled as to how this product has such a high rating. Yes, it isn&#x27;t expensive, but it also isn&#x27;t that great of a product.</li>
    <li> Amazing brush. My dentist said I needed an electronic tooth brush and this one works perfectly. It&#x27;s a little big for the back teeth but works amazingly well cleaning my teeth and gums.</li>
    <li> It works good. Lots of power for a good price.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice electric toothbrush. Not as powerful as the cordless/rechargeables from Oral-B (like the Vitality), but for the price it&#x27;s a winner. It&#x27;s a bit noisier than its pricey counterpart and doesn&#x27;t oscillate as fast as its big brother, not a knock  just an observation. The brushing head is bigger, I kinda like the smaller size but it&#x27;s not a deal breaker. The plastic cap to cover the head is very useful, fits snugly and great the for on-the-go user. I haven&#x27;t tried changing the head yet but I guess you get a tool to remove it. It&#x27;s a system !!! I would definitely recommend this as an inexpensive alternative to the cordless Oral-Bs.</li>
    <li> very good, I love it.</li>
    <li> Best toothbrush ever. It&#x27;s almost as small as a non-powered toothbrush and outperforms your average, cumbersome electric toothbrush. Having to make space and use a power outlet for a power toothbrush sux, battery all the way!</li>
    <li> it is great that make my teeth so  clean and white</li>
    <li> Works well.... battery doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> I purchased one of these brushes only because it had a coupon offered through Amazon.  When I got it I was very impressed.  It has tons of power and runs circles around any other brush of this type I have ever purchased.  This is well worth the minor investment.</li>
    <li> The Oral B 3d White Action is a good quality toothbrush. It is reseasonably priced, fast and efficient with a good sized brush unit that is easily changed.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is not my first Oral-B electric toothbrush. And it certainly won&#x27;t be my last either. My first one was given to me by my aunt, who is a (retired) dentist. For $5 or $6, it&#x27;s a great deal. I don&#x27;t quite understand why people spend $50 or even $100 on an electric toothbrush. And this one is compact enough to carry in your toilet kit when you travel. It only requires 1 AA battery (which can last a few months), while the more expensive ones have a recharging base and what not, that needs to be plugged in, rendering them not practical for travel, particularly outside of North America, where the voltage is likely to be 220V, and the plug different. No such problem with this toothbrush. A winner.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for.  This thing is noisy and causes toothpaste to drip out of my mouth.  Gross, I know, but that&#x27;s what happens.</li>
    <li> Going from a Sonicare to a replacement while I waited for new brush heads to arrive, this looked like a good get-me-by.  The performance of this brush is so bad you think your battery is DOA, but it&#x27;s not the battery, it&#x27;s the toothbrush.  The head is very soft and with poor mechanical quality, you&#x27;re basically forced to bear down on your teeth, which slows the automation even more.  Threw it away in 4 days.</li>
    <li> The package looks a bit old.On the back of the package had a little arched, leading to the opening  has been a little open.Maybe it&#x27;s the way of transportation.But I don&#x27;t want to see this.</li>
    <li> best electric tooth brush and a great price.  love this thing my teeth love it too.</li>
    <li> was not sure what to expect but I am very happy with the results. way better than normal brushes.</li>
    <li> Great stuff worth the money. Good alternatives.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush, it was very affordable and it cleans my mouth great. Leaves my mouth feeling cleaner than ever. I ordered my wife one and she loves hers too,.</li>
    <li> My dentist used to give these away with every cleaning. I loved it because I got a new toothbrush every six months. Sadly, his supplier stopped carrying them and now he&#x27;s back to the old fashioned ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband and I were thrilled to find them on here for so cheap. Bonus is I added it to our Subscribe and Save so two fresh ones arrive every six months. We just toss our old ones and no need to worry about the batteries or remembering to replace our brushes often enough.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an ok for startup.</li>
    <li> Does not stand up.&lt;br /&gt;I never expected to buy a powered toothbrush that would not stand up. This was my first Oral-B, and oribably the last.</li>
    <li> My teeth never looked better. An excellent buy.  Good price, so even better</li>
    <li> I cannot believe how clean my teeth are now and how much more fun and easy it is to brush. I cant believe it took me this long to try an electric toothbrush. I bought it as an ADD-ON and paid half of what it sells for at CVS.</li>
    <li> does great job cleaning my grandson&#x27;s teeth</li>
    <li> Item arrived quickly, exactly as advertised, works great - Thanks !  (Dogs got to the package first and chewed it up - I rescued the toothbrush - the battery had run down - works great and does a fine job...</li>
    <li> So I got this in a deal for $2.5 so was not a bad deal for me but for the regular price I don&#x27;t think its worth it for an adult ... the head has a weird structure seems the bristles occupy very less area of the head and becomes difficult with the sides rubbing against the gums</li>
    <li> the funtion is good, the design is nice, and the quality excelent</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just ok, there is no bottom stand on it, so it doesn&#x27;t stand up like other spin brushes.</li>
    <li> The product was exactly what I expected!</li>
    <li> What a slick toothbrush!</li>
    <li> Reviewed from my 6 year old daughter - I like it was really powerful, it&#x27;s really fun to put it in my mouth.</li>
    <li> Really, really noisy but works fine.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t care for this toothbrush. I find in noisy and the &amp;#34;rotating&amp;#34; head doesn&#x27;t really rotate but jiggles back and forth. I don&#x27;t like how the handle feel as well.</li>
    <li> Best value battery toothbrush. We did have the other version of this toothbrush that was rechargeable, but battery only lasted 2 years. We figure this one would last longer and be cheaper in the long run even if we bought and replaced new batteries or used rechargeable. Cleans very good and is faster and easier to clean teeth than some brands with a small circle brush.&lt;br /&gt;Only complaint is that there is a small gap around where the battery goes. We bought two and both have it, no amount of pushing will keep it completly closed.&lt;br /&gt;Overall very nice.</li>
    <li> This budget electric toothbrush is fantastic. I don&#x27;t feel any need to spend $100 or  $150. It uses AA batteries. The battery is well protected from water with the compartment. The rechargeable battery that I put in one month ago still have plenty of charge. I believe the head replacements are quite reasonably priced as well.</li>
    <li> I did not like my first Oral-B electric tooth brush because it is way too big and vibrates too much. Thought the smaller one may be better, but what am I thinking...</li>
    <li> Helps keep the dentist away! My last cleaning was painless thanks to this brush.</li>
    <li> For me, the pros is that the Oral-B toothbrush has an easy grip and the top circular brush spins quickly for a polished feel. Unfortunately the little motor in this thing could rival a full fledged drill. Not.even.kidding. It is so loud! Also, an issue for me (and may not be for others) is that the electric toothbrush seems to irritate past dental work if I linger more than a second on that tooth. I didn&#x27;t have this problem with my electric Crest brush or standard toothbrush so I can assume it&#x27;s the aggressive nature of the Oral-B brush. If you like it rough, then you&#x27;re in for a treat.</li>
    <li> #1 nuff said&lt;br /&gt;and they don&#x27;t mold up as peeps say.</li>
    <li> This one is the only lower-priced units that has lasted any length of time and I will buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;Advice: With any electronic toothbrush I would recommend storing upside down or horizontal so the water can drain from the brush head rather than run down inside where it can grow some nasty stuff.  Putting them in a toothbrush holder allows the water to run down inside the head unit. Once in a while I turn mine upside-down in a short glass with some either vinegar or hydrogen peroxide and let it soak, then leave it to dry.</li>
    <li> nothing I need to say special about it..&lt;br /&gt;Everybody use it for many years.&lt;br /&gt;Primarily no minus</li>
    <li> Good product as described.</li>
    <li> For anyone who loves an electric toothbrush this is my favorite.  It leaves your teeth and gums feeling sparkling white and clean, and it is by far the most comfortable to hold. I even appreciate how easy they made it to change out the battery, as I&#x27;ve had a few that it was a serious challenge.</li>
    <li> When I first bought one of these, I didn&#x27;t really expect much... that was maybe 7 years ago.  They really do a job cleaning the teeth.  When my last one gave out, it was a few weeks before I could get a new one shipped to me (out of country) and did I ever miss it.  I replaced it with not just one, but after being without for so long, I bought a couple back-ups.  They last me about a year.</li>
    <li> I wish it stood up on its own.</li>
    <li> Very fast ship. Good product. Thanks! Just what I needed! Hope to come back to the store the next time I need something like this.</li>
    <li> This is the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used.  It literally feels like I walked out of the dentist chair every time I use it.  The first one lasted about 6 months before the bristles started to wear.  I tossed it not knowing the head was replaceable.  You don&#x27;t need to apply much pressure to your teeth, just let the head work it&#x27;s magic.  The latest one I&#x27;ve had since August and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
    <li> Toothbrush stem is little too thick and that&#x27;s why things start dripping out while brushing the teeth. Now I understand, why expensive power toothbrushes have slick head and stem. But for $3.50 this brush is a steal.</li>
    <li> My first electric toothbrush. I love it. The difference from brushing with regular brush to this was amazing. My teeth feels extra clean!</li>
    <li> Excellent. Much better to buy another every three months or so. This way you don&#x27;t have to replace batteries and brushes and start out new.</li>
    <li> Only have had our toothbrushes for about 3 days and so far so good.....</li>
    <li> great toothbrush.. purchased a few and still using.</li>
    <li> I use these for both of my children.  My dentist is thrilled with their teeth, even my daughter&#x27;s who has had a long medical history and should have horrible teeth.  \\&quot;Electric\\&quot; tooth brushes are reported to clean better and these seem to.  We used the first set for over 3.5 years (just changed the heads every 5-6 months).  One of the brushes just stopped working and I&#x27;m replacing it.  The other is still going strong.  For under $7 you really can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> fast shipping, good product. would buy again.</li>
    <li> I liked this brush it&#x27;s really good in making the teeth whiter&lt;br /&gt;but it does not clean well between the teeth</li>
