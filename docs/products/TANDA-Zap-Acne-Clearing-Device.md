      <li>This one is great for people who like me just break out right around that time.</li>
      <li>Its a great product because its a good size, the amount of heat is perect, the vibration is just enough to notice and the light is nice and bright.</li>
      <li>Just before trying the Zap, I decided to try a more holistic approach to clearing up my outbreaks</li>
      <li>I notice it never lasts more than a day.</li>
      <li>Love love love.</li>
      <li>I was getting, more cystic.</li>
      <li>and It has cleared up my face by 90% or more.  </li>
      <li>, I had many blemishes to use it on.</li>
      <li>I would love to have it replaced, but guess what...</li>
      <li>my face has looked better..</li>
      <li>save your money or invest in something better.</li>
      <li>but its better then them all coming out..</li>
      <li>I have hormonal acne and although it&#x27;s not a cure, it does help make it more manageable.</li>
      <li>And like magic, they disappear before they even start</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t afford a dermatologist and tried many OTC products.</li>
      <li>I bought that one for my niece since she has more acne and love it.</li>
      <li>prety sure.</li>
      <li>okay I will keep at it&amp;#34;  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve done everything, seen the dermatologies many times, tons of creams etc.  </li>
      <li>I have been suffering for acne for more years than I&#x27;d like to admit and am always looking for things to help.</li>
      <li>I work out and the bacteria from sweat makes me more prone to acne.</li>
      <li>I get better overnight results with &amp;#34;Acnomel&amp;#34; acne cream.</li>
      <li>I am more confident and now have a great job with professional coworkers.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Works pretty good.  </li>
      <li>It works quickly to heal open blemishes, but works best before the blemish has even made it through the skin.  </li>
      <li>you can easily pop...</li>
      <li>so it travels easily.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty amazing.</li>
      <li>Its in fine print in the instructions.</li>
      <li>I give it a 4 because I wish there was something to show how many you have used it and the battery dies so quick</li>
      <li>It was also a huge time-drain.</li>
      <li>I have noticed a huge difference since I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall this was more than worth the money for me.</li>
      <li>I feel as though it should continue until the light dies, and even then, the light should be replaceable.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how they expect to have a risk free trial if they don&#x27;t want you to use it.</li>
      <li>They also don&#x27;t tell you they are good for only so many uses</li>
      <li>Overall I am happy with the purchase and would recommend to people with mild acne.</li>
      <li>I bought another one after the original died, after 1000+ uses.</li>
      <li>True story.</li>
      <li>BUT the one thing that is not advertised is it only works for so many 2 min zap sessions!</li>
      <li>I think probably when it first came out!</li>
      <li>But it is worth it.</li>
      <li>Not as good as I expected.</li>
      <li>They are so deep, take forever to surface, and then when they do they scar because I never leave them alone and let them go away on their own.  </li>
      <li>The blue light technology is very bright and it vibrates and heats up a little bit.</li>
      <li>but apparently if you use it you can&#x27;t even though the box says Risk Free Trail Guarantee!  </li>
      <li>and it turned on in my face and made my eyes funny for a while.</li>
      <li>I started using the zap the first day I got it</li>
      <li>I will most likely purchase another one when it&#x27;s done.</li>
      <li>I actullay do love this, as it definitely does work.  </li>
      <li>I noticed a difference in the first day of use.</li>
      <li>Did not see amazing results like other people.</li>
      <li>As other reviewers have commented, the batteries may drain quickly, just invest in rechargables and you will be fine.</li>
      <li>I have to be honest when it came in the mail I felt like a fool because it looks like a little flashlight.  </li>
      <li>In a few short uses, I&#x27;ve seen great results.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t work as fast as they say it does.</li>
      <li>nothing really worked.  </li>
      <li>haha</li>
      <li>When it did it was like my whole face was getting attacked this time….</li>
      <li>This product did absolutely nothing.</li>
      <li>I really like this.  </li>
      <li>As described and shipped fast.  </li>
      <li>Ok so I was sceptical especially since I am an esthetician and have worked with professional equipment and products for a decade.</li>
      <li>my other acne products are working, but my acne is doing better, so I&#x27;ll give it 3 stars.</li>
      <li>After using it for about a week, I was amazed to have clear skin for the first time since I hit puberty.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t use it consistently so was nowhere near to 1000 uses and it has died already.</li>
      <li>For me personally, going back to just popping them was better than the results I got on here.</li>
      <li>I decided to use this smaller version as a trial but I will be upgrading to the larger one so that I can cover more of my face for preventive maintenance verses after a pimple is spotted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
      <li>I thought it was the batteries, but after googling why I was getting a steady red light and it wasn&#x27;t turning on, I found out that clearly wasn&#x27;t the case.</li>
      <li>I decided to try the tanda zap when my acne started to go from mild to moderate.</li>
      <li>I had high hopes for this, and it did not touch even the superficial acne.  </li>
      <li>Ugh not since high school has it come back….</li>
      <li>Other topical solutions weren&#x27;t as effective either.</li>
      <li>I used the Zeno device in the past, and certainly have had better results with this product.  </li>
      <li>It does seem to keep the pimples or outbreak under control or heal them quicker than normal.</li>
      <li>(my normal face routine)</li>
      <li>It said if you start a zap and shut it off, if its less than 30 seconds it won&#x27;t count against the so many complete sessions.</li>
      <li>I has a new spot coming up</li>
      <li>It stopped vibrating, and only the blue light remained functioning.</li>
      <li>I still get a few pimples but nowhere near as many.</li>
      <li>The bump didn&#x27;t grow at all and went away in 2-3 days, when usually it stays for a couple weeks :)</li>
      <li>I have used the Zeno in the past but this gives you more treatments for the price you pay.</li>
      <li>And last time when I first started to feel one coming on, I immediately used this that night.</li>
      <li>I am not sure if this product actually works or if there&#x27;s a placebo effect at work, but I think that it actually does quicken the healing process for pimples, making them decrease in size and go away much more quickly.  </li>
      <li>Unfortunately, I haven&#x27;t been able to find one of those in the store, and I am wondering if it has been taking off the market because I could theoretically how  a person with sensitive skin could burn easily with that method.</li>
      <li>but I managed to clear my face within 2 weeks.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is one of those products that I think to myself, &amp;#34;what was I thinking.&amp;#34; I wanted to try something that I could get OTC for acne but honestly just go to the Dr and get a script if it&#x27;s that bad. It seemed like it was maybe working a little when I 1st started using it but no dramatic results. At least I know better now.</li>
    <li> I have always struggled with acne. I was hoping that by the time I hit my late twenties, I&#x27;d grow out of it. But I still get clusters on my chin and nose. Even worse, my skin is really sensitive, so every acne treatment I tried either dried it out or caused a red rash.&lt;br /&gt;I was super skeptical of this product when I first came across it, but I figured I&#x27;d tried everything else, so I gave it a go. After using it for about a week, I was amazed to have clear skin for the first time since I hit puberty. Now, I don&#x27;t even have to use it everyday, just whenever I feel one or two about to flare up. And like magic, they disappear before they even start showing.&lt;br /&gt;The battery use hasn&#x27;t been so bad for me, but I only use it periodically now.</li>
    <li> It has helped..I even use it before I notice zits As daily maintenence..try to do it along my jaw and chin everyday or every other day a few times..my face has looked better..there are a few that didnt go away but its better then them all coming out..plus yes this uses alot of batteries..it says it does in the directions booklet..best to get rechargable ones..I would recomend trying this.</li>
    <li> Speeds up the life cycle of a pimple.  It&#x27;s not going to make your pimples disappear overnight but it brings them out a lot faster and prevents cystic acne from coming to a head.  When I apply to cystic acne, the swelling is reduced following day and eventually it disappears.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I will purchase again when this one runs out.  I like it and only use under my chin and jawline.</li>
    <li> I purchased this b/c my skin was so bad. I thought this would be an alternate to heat treatments.Some reviewers said there was warmth, but I didn&#x27;t feel any. And the item&#x27;s packaging says it&#x27;s not intended for cysts. I tried it anyway, but no good.</li>
    <li> So far, I haven&#x27;t had any problems with this device. It seems to help shorten the length of time it takes for a pimple to go away. When you are desperate to get rid of a problem area on your face, this investment is definitely worth it. I gave it 4 stars instead of five because I wish it worked even faster. Still, a great value for the money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using for about a month now. I think it works as suggested. I use once in the morning and evening and target any outbreak. It does seem to keep the pimples or outbreak under control or heal them quicker than normal. I used to use tazorac and wanted to try a non-prescription alternative. I think it&#x27;s worth trying if you are tired of using prescriptions that seem to work for a short period and then fail. As other reviewers have commented, the batteries may drain quickly, just invest in rechargables and you will be fine. I decided to use this smaller version as a trial but I will be upgrading to the larger one so that I can cover more of my face for preventive maintenance verses after a pimple is spotted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as an FYI - I am mid-thirties and have had to battle with adult acne. The tazorac was working for a while, but then it stopped being as effective. Other topical solutions weren&#x27;t as effective either. Just before trying the Zap, I decided to try a more holistic approach to clearing up my outbreaks so I started taking vitamins - particularly zinc, D, B complex; and I started using burt&#x27;s bees products. My face was starting to clear up as a result. The Zap is a helpful compliment (I think). I hope it continues to work for a while.</li>
    <li> I have had this item for about 2 weeks. I have not used it daily and it is already malfunctioning. The lights blink off and on. They are dim. And I&#x27;ve already changed the batteries. Dont waste your money.</li>
    <li> Its hard to tell if it helps. Yes my breakout started to improve but no sooner then it would have by its self. I has a new spot coming up and it did kill it. In my experience it is more effective on emerging bumps not ones already there. It did not improve white heads or black heads at all.</li>
    <li> I got this product from a groupon about 1 or 2 years ago…. I think probably when it first came out! I used it a little in the beginning, and seemed to work great…. Lost it for about 1 year haha…… started getting flair ups of my PSORIASIS on my face again…. Ugh not since high school has it come back…. When it did it was like my whole face was getting attacked this time…. When i was younger i went tanning to get rid of it, but now i&#x27;m almost 30 and tanning no more! So i went searching for my TANDA! It was like a miracle! i have never even changed the batteries in this thing. (Maybe i should) My PSORIASIS is completely gone, and i didn&#x27;t have to fake and bake to get rid of it this time!</li>
    <li> Bought this product for the occasional pimple that I have, but for whatever reason it has the tendency of turning my pimples into embedded pimples, which are by far the worst. For me personally, going back to just popping them was better than the results I got on here. I will note, if could just be my skin just doesn&#x27;t like this process. I just use to have one those devices that would heat up and kill the bacterial that way. I never had problems with that and it always worked. Unfortunately, I haven&#x27;t been able to find one of those in the store, and I am wondering if it has been taking off the market because I could theoretically how  a person with sensitive skin could burn easily with that method. In either way, the tanda zap did not work for me.</li>
    <li> Its small but not too small, its easy to hold in your hand it takes 3 AAA batteries. The blue light technology is very bright and it vibrates and heats up a little bit. Its a great product because its a good size, the amount of heat is perect, the vibration is just enough to notice and the light is nice and bright. It didnt irritate, did not make my skin red and didnt hurt not one bit! my skin looks great!</li>
    <li> Did not see amazing results like other people. I get better overnight results with &amp;#34;Acnomel&amp;#34; acne cream. Time consuming if there is a lot of breakout.</li>
    <li> I decided to try the tanda zap when my acne started to go from mild to moderate. I was getting the type of pimples that you can feel under your skin before they come up. They would come up, take a couple of days to recede and then scar. I started using the zap the first day I got it, I had many blemishes to use it on. I used it twice a day on each pimple and not 2 weeks later I had no use for the thing anymore. I wasn&#x27;t getting any of those blemishes anymore. Now when I feel the occasional pimple coming up I stop it before it can appear on my skin. Also, I have had it 4 months at this point and changed the batteries once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this was more than worth the money for me. I think the zap is best used on the type of pimples I was getting, more cystic. I cant speak for it&#x27;s use against white heads or other acne.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s working or my other acne products are working, but my acne is doing better, so I&#x27;ll give it 3 stars. However, the thing stops working after 1000 uses. I thought it was the batteries, but after googling why I was getting a steady red light and it wasn&#x27;t turning on, I found out that clearly wasn&#x27;t the case. The fact that this is $40 for 1000 uses seems ridiculous. I feel as though it should continue until the light dies, and even then, the light should be replaceable. Also note that it&#x27;s 1000 uses including the times when you hit the button accidentally and hit it again to turn it off (yeah that counted).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice: save your money or invest in something better.</li>
    <li> first off im only writting this on amazon cuz the tanda website wont put a bad review on it so it didnt post my review. this product didnt help one bit in fact it may have made it worse. i started using this product in the middle of april for my teen acne and hoped my face would be clear by june which was my brothers wedding, but it wasnt. it did get warm but that was about it.and also when i got it out of the box and it turned on in my face and made my eyes funny for a while. i used it faithhfully for over 2 months and saw no improvement. the place is a scam im prety sure. they had terrible customer srvice and took 3 weeks to get here. please do not order this it is terrible and doesnt work one bit. again this is a review for the tanda website that they wouldnt post.</li>
    <li> This tool is a must have for me. I&#x27;m 27 and I suffer from acne and cystic acne to the point where I wont go to social gatherings when i break out. Lately I&#x27;ve been breaking out around my cheeks. They say it doesn&#x27;t work on cystic acne but it does for me. Usually when I get cystic acne it can last up to a month before it completely heals and what i mean by completely healed is where I can put on makeup and not see a bump or not feel the mini lump inside my skin. With the tandem it cuts the time in half. So lets say like 2 weeks and a whitehead shows up. Topical treatments don&#x27;t work on cystic fast enough but this tool does. I won&#x27;t know what i will do if they discontinued it. I&#x27;m going to invest in buying the bigger one because it can take forever if I break out all over my face. I give it a 4 because I wish there was something to show how many you have used it and the battery dies so quick (Thank God rechargeable batteries now exist)</li>
    <li> I was using this  product regularly as directed, but my acne didn&#x27;t go away any faster.  I didn&#x27;t notice any results.</li>
    <li> just one month later, it can not work any longer.&lt;br /&gt;i tried to change the batteries, but still the same.</li>
    <li> I really like this.  I do wish they has larger ones for the same price.  Honestly only reason I don&#x27;t give it a 5 is because it is small and would take forever if you had a face full of acne.  If so get the Tandra clear + is bigger and you can get it for about $100 on amazon.  I bought that one for my niece since she has more acne and love it. This one is great for people who like me just break out right around that time.</li>
    <li> Works surprisingly well!</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd Tanda Zap. I never knew how much I relied on it until my other one ran out of treatments. I use it frequently and still lasted me over a year. Like others have suggested,  definitely use rechargeable batteries as they go fast. I have used the Zeno in the past but this gives you more treatments for the price you pay. It doesn&#x27;t work on all blemishes but works well with cystic acne if you catch them early on. I use it the moment I feel one brewing under the skin (I instantly do 2 treatments back to back) and multiple times daily if needed. I have hormonal acne and although it&#x27;s not a cure, it does help make it more manageable. Does not work on blackheads. If it doesn&#x27;t eliminate the pimple for me, it stops it from growing and brings it to a head sooner. I still use other topical medications as a spot treatment along with the Tanda.</li>
    <li> The product has worked.  Takes a couple extra zaps sometimes. BUT the one thing that is not advertised is it only works for so many 2 min zap sessions! It was in the hundreds, but certainly no where to be found on the ad. Its in fine print in the instructions. Had I not read the entire thing I would have missed it. It said if you start a zap and shut it off, if its less than 30 seconds it won&#x27;t count against the so many complete sessions.</li>
    <li> I actullay do love this, as it definitely does work.  I had one before that ran its course of 1,000 or so zaps.  BUT, something happened with this one, it just stopped working and I see what looks like a melted plastic peice at the bottom.  I&#x27;ve always stored the Tanda zap undone, batteries out.  So, no reason for this.  It&#x27;s like it overheated or something.  I would love to have it replaced, but guess what...I&#x27;m 2 days past the return policy.  I really want another but don&#x27;t want to throw down another $45 for one since this one broke in under a month and under 20 uses!!  Any help with this amazon?</li>
    <li> This product did absolutely nothing.</li>
    <li> I have been using this in conjunction with antibacterial face wash and occasional acne cream (my normal face routine) and It has cleared up my face by 90% or more.  It works quickly to heal open blemishes, but works best before the blemish has even made it through the skin.  Love love love.</li>
    <li> Seriously, I&#x27;m a 38 year old women with acne, what?  I&#x27;ve done everything, seen the dermatologies many times, tons of creams etc.  nothing really worked.  So I bought this thing out of desperation.  I have to be honest when it came in the mail I felt like a fool because it looks like a little flashlight.  But I used it that evening on clean skin and in the morning all my red acne flare ups were smaller and no longer red!  So I thought &amp;#34; wow okay I will keep at it&amp;#34;  It says to use two or three times per day until your acne is under control.  I did and by the third day I had no acne at all!!! No Joke!  So I still get flare ups every once in awhile but I just use this and within 24 hours its almost gone and by day three it is gone!  It works!!</li>
    <li> I am not sure if this product actually works or if there&#x27;s a placebo effect at work, but I think that it actually does quicken the healing process for pimples, making them decrease in size and go away much more quickly.  My husband has used the device a few times and agrees.  So whether it&#x27;s just in our heads, or this thing actually works, I like it.  I used the Zeno device in the past, and certainly have had better results with this product.  Also, prior to purchasing the device, I read some negative reviews regarding the battery life.  I would like to comment on this by saying I have not had a problem with the battery life.  I can&#x27;t say that I use the product every day, but I do use it multiple times in a day sometimes if I have a really bad blemish I want to get rid of, and I have not had to replace the batteries yet (going on probably 5 months of use now).  Overall, I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Do NOT buy this! Arrived broken.</li>
    <li> It works, but not a fast as I would like!  I will most likely purchase another one when it&#x27;s done.</li>
    <li> I bought three of these and they are useless. They don&#x27;t stop the pimple from forming and don&#x27;t help remove the zit or decrease the size at all. They also don&#x27;t tell you they are good for only so many uses and then you just have to throw them out.</li>
    <li> In a few short uses, I&#x27;ve seen great results. I have had small, blocked under skin sebaceous glands that keep coming back.  After using the Tanda, I&#x27;ve gotten rid of all and have seen great results on leasing the time to heal for acne.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this, and it did not touch even the superficial acne.  Tanda said this device was not for cystic acne, but other people had said it works for this anyway.... no, not at all</li>
    <li> Ok so I was sceptical especially since I am an esthetician and have worked with professional equipment and products for a decade. But I have been travelling a lot and my skin is the worse for it so I decided to try it. I only get the odd pimple so it was perfect for me and it is small so it travels easily. I noticed a difference in the first day of use. And if I catch the pimple as it is just comin up I notice it never lasts more than a day. I give it a big thumbs up!!!</li>
    <li> This device is great! I had severe cystic acne and it was so bad I didn&#x27;t want to leave the house or apply for other jobs white obtaining my degree. Even my coworkers noticed and bullied me, and I was in my 30s. I couldn&#x27;t afford a dermatologist and tried many OTC products. My father saw this on a health TV program and he offered to buy this. I was reluctant but figured why not. I noticed a difference the next day. What a relief! I still have scarring and redness but I managed to clear my face within 2 weeks. Whenever a cyst starts I take care of it immediately. I am more confident and now have a great job with professional coworkers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does use a lot of batteries but I use rechargeable batteries so that eliminates extra cost. I bought another one after the original died, after 1000+ uses. Best investment for my career!</li>
    <li> I have noticed a huge difference since I&#x27;ve been using it. I still get a few pimples but nowhere near as many.</li>
    <li> I purchased it the end of April and it stop working in July.  I thought the batteries died because in the few short months I owned it, I replaced the batteries 3x.  Now it does not work at all.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I work out and the bacteria from sweat makes me more prone to acne. So after workouts I use and at bedtime. It stops them before they start. I like it. Even caught my boyfriend using it.</li>
    <li> This is a miracle.  I was skeptical at first but seriously this thing works!  I don&#x27;t have acne but I do get those deep, oil head things under the skin that happen maybe a couple times a month.  They are so deep, take forever to surface, and then when they do they scar because I never leave them alone and let them go away on their own.  This thing, I already had one that was surfacing and I treated it with this Tanda Zap and one day later (so two treatments) it was visibly smaller!  It was shrinking and then I kept treating it and less than a week later it is way small.  Now it won&#x27;t scar and it isn&#x27;t noticeable.  I would definitely recommend this!  It&#x27;s pretty amazing.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as great as I would have hoped. Still ended up going to a dermatologist.</li>
    <li> It will work if you do it several times a day and have patience.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work as fast as they say it does. I also don&#x27;t think mine heats up either. I tried returning it but apparently if you use it you can&#x27;t even though the box says Risk Free Trail Guarantee!  I don&#x27;t know how they expect to have a risk free trial if they don&#x27;t want you to use it. Just kind of frustrating since its expensive. I wish I had glowing reviews like some of the other people on here but who knows it could of been writen by the makers of the device.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 weeks now and I&#x27;m liking it so far. I usually get really deep pimples that just turn into a big bump, instead of ones you can easily pop...I think it&#x27;s cystic acne. So I got this to use it on those tough ones. It&#x27;s definitely been helping!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed that they&#x27;ve gotten smaller quicker. And last time when I first started to feel one coming on, I immediately used this that night. The bump didn&#x27;t grow at all and went away in 2-3 days, when usually it stays for a couple weeks :)</li>
    <li> Everyone seems to claim it will get rid of a zit in 24 hours. I noticed a difference after one day, but the \\&quot;WOW WHAT A DIFFERENCE\\&quot; was after 3 days. STILL its an amazing tool. I&#x27;m definitely going to buy this again after mine dies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad parts: needs 3 new AAA batteries every week (but I buy at the dollar store), and its time consuming. You have to hold it on a zit/spot for 2 minutes each time. Using 2x/day, on 6 different spots, thats a whole half hour a day just sitting there with this thing. But it is worth it. I&#x27;ve never gotten rid of a zit without it popping until this tool. True story.</li>
    <li> Not as good as I expected. It helps bring them to a head but they do not disappear.</li>
    <li> I have been suffering for acne for more years than I&#x27;d like to admit and am always looking for things to help. I get regular facials and use products daily but still have pimples that pop up out of nowhere. I have to say, I think this product actually works. I&#x27;ve used it on 3 pimples this week that could have erupted into large, painful cysts, and they have stayed small or have gone away. I&#x27;m afraid to jinx myself, but I think this works!</li>
    <li> This product did not work, so I returned it. It only seemed to stay on 1:3 times. I never heard back and it&#x27;s been over a 11 days.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after severely breaking out in several places on my face (forehead, nose, cheeks, and upper lip). I was very hopeful about this product because it seemed to be to less of a risk than anything topical which might cause further break outs. Unfortunately, it did not have any effect on most of the larger, cystic pimples that I already had. It did clear away smaller pimples as long as I used it immediately, but, as these smaller ones were not my main concern, the performance was pretty disappointing. It was also a huge time-drain. Each spot treatment cycle takes three minutes. With the amount of pimples in different locations that I had, this took about 1.5 hours to do at a time, and trying to do this 2-3 times a day was out of the question. But the nail in the coffin was that the unit stopped working correctly after about a month. It stopped vibrating, and only the blue light remained functioning. I was probably close to the thousand use limit, so it was not too much of a loss, but it is definitely an indication of the quality of this product that it did not even work correctly for the indicated life.</li>
    <li> I bought this through MyHabit and have had it for about 3 weeks. I didn&#x27;t use it consistently so was nowhere near to 1000 uses and it has died already. It did seem to work for its short time span so it got the second star. Too expensive for a unit that can&#x27;t be returned and is defective.</li>
    <li> Waste of money. Doesn&#x27;t work in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Works pretty good.  As described and shipped fast.  Overall I am happy with the purchase and would recommend to people with mild acne.</li>
