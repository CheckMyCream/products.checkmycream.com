      <li>I&#x27;m a therapist with neck pain and truly gives me a pain free slep.  </li>
      <li>Cheap foam doesn&#x27;t hold form.</li>
      <li>and it isn&#x27;t always easy to find that sweet spot.  </li>
      <li>Neck pain is significantly reduced.</li>
      <li>This is the original pillow that is in the book.  </li>

      <li>This has really helped with my neck and shoulder pain.  </li>
      <li>Plus, it makes a really fun toy for my two young grandchildren.</li>
      <li>Since I wasn&#x27;t worried about support, I didn&#x27;t really care about the firmness as much as some customers.</li>
      <li>The only issue is there is no cover that will fit this</li>
      <li>and I wondered how it would do much, but I put it in my pillow and voila.  </li>
      <li>But I just put my neck roll in a regular pillow case to keep it clean.  </li>
      <li>It definitely though was a good enough deal to try and i would recommend others try it as well since everyone is different.</li>
      <li>I highly recomend it.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t care for it so much, but that&#x27;s a personal preference.</li>
      <li>it fit a little crooked on the pillow.</li>
      <li>Got this for my wife, she loves it, just firm enough to do the job, but soft enough to be comfortable.</li>
      <li>I have spent lots of money buying pillows to find a comfortable one with no success.</li>
      <li>Small enough to fit the curve of my neck.  </li>

<li> All were variations of too hard or soft; or diameter too large or small.</li>
<li> Sold sparsely by some chiropractors and McKenzie (physical) therapists, this little guy is the way to go.</li>
<li> It is just a bit too wide as it moves my head forward a bit and the material of the tube or roll is not that comfy.</li>
<li> The nights I fall asleep reading before arranging my pillows with it or &amp;#34;migrate&amp;#34; to other pillows while sleeping are all the proof I need.</li>
<li> &amp; I&#x27;ve tried three or four other tube pillows.</li>
<li> This is working well under my neck when I lay down.</li>
<li> If you have a small or delicate neck, your traditional neck pillow is probably not cradling your cervical spine, but pushing it forward and slightly out of alignment.</li>
<li> But, I think it may be just a little narrow for him.</li>
<li> I tried using it for a few weeks when i slept to see if i could break it in</li>
<li> When it came it seemed limp</li>
<li> Not too firm, and not too fat.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
<li> There&#x27;s a gap between my headboard and my mattress, and my pillows slip down if I&#x27;m sitting in bed with pillows behind me, so I thought this might fix that problem.</li>
<li> solved my neck problems - no more headaches!  </li>
<li> I was waking up with horrific headaches all the time.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have had major neck damage, have had a shot for the pain which was temperary relief, but this cervical roll is great. No pain what so ever. I highly recomend it.</li>
    <li> This is a good deal but for me, this was too stiff. I tried using it for a few weeks when i slept to see if i could break it in but it never got softer. It definitely though was a good enough deal to try and i would recommend others try it as well since everyone is different.</li>
    <li> Excellent!  Does the job as advertised and arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> solved my neck problems - no more headaches!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> A superb buy! I&#x27;m a therapist with neck pain and truly gives me a pain free slep.  Thank you!!</li>
    <li> I have tried a ton of products for neck pain. This pillow is awesome. Works great and helped with some of the pain.</li>
    <li> The idea is great for this product, but it didn&#x27;t work for me. It is just a bit too wide as it moves my head forward a bit and the material of the tube or roll is not that comfy. I tried it for awhile but it is sitting in my closet unused. The cover can be removed for washing. U may want to wash it in a mesh bag because after I washed it (no dryer) it fit a little crooked on the pillow.</li>
    <li> The belt arrived in perfect order. Glad to get it and use it for my neck.</li>
    <li> Biggest rip off ever. Cheap foam doesn&#x27;t hold form. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> Very nice product.  It supports the neck for side sleeping, back sleeping and I&#x27;ve even slept on my tummy. I would recommend this pillow to anyone who has cervical issues. Plus, it makes a really fun toy for my two young grandchildren.</li>
    <li> The ONLY neck roll for tiny folks. Not too firm, and not too fat. If you have a small or delicate neck, your traditional neck pillow is probably not cradling your cervical spine, but pushing it forward and slightly out of alignment. Sold sparsely by some chiropractors and McKenzie (physical) therapists, this little guy is the way to go.</li>
    <li> I love this pillow.  It is easy to take with me when I go out of town and works perfectly at home.  I feel good in the morning.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t care for it so much, but that&#x27;s a personal preference. It&#x27;s smaller than I expected/desired, so make sure you read the specs ahead of time. It&#x27;s also softer than I wanted.</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife, she loves it, just firm enough to do the job, but soft enough to be comfortable.</li>
    <li> Small enough to fit the curve of my neck.  I place it beneath a pillow with similar thickness.  In the morning, I no longer get neck stiffness.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.  The only issue is there is no cover that will fit this so I put it inside the pillow case with the pillow.</li>
    <li> This is the original pillow that is in the book.  Made in USA too.  The cover has a zipper so you can remove it to wash.  But I just put my neck roll in a regular pillow case to keep it clean.  This has really helped with my neck and shoulder pain.  I sleep on my side, but this pillow works if you sleep on your back also.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s a gap between my headboard and my mattress, and my pillows slip down if I&#x27;m sitting in bed with pillows behind me, so I thought this might fix that problem. I was expecting this to be larger (maybe I should have pulled out a tape measurer) but it does work for what I need. Since I wasn&#x27;t worried about support, I didn&#x27;t really care about the firmness as much as some customers. It doesn&#x27;t get flattened or pushed down, so it&#x27;s good for what I needed..</li>
    <li> I am thoroughly pleased with my purchase. I have spent lots of money buying pillows to find a comfortable one with no success. This pillow is my answer.</li>
    <li> Has helped me so much already. My physical therapist suggested it since I nurse my baby in bed, and the angle caused me to get a lot of pulls on my neck and shoulders. This has taken all that away.</li>
    <li> This is working well under my neck when I lay down.</li>
    <li> Excellent!  Now having a good sleep.</li>
    <li> This cervical roll has helped, and continues to help, me so much! I was waking up with horrific headaches all the time. I went through a 30 day period of them and was even to the point of specialists and injections. Using this faithfully makes all the difference, for me. The nights I fall asleep reading before arranging my pillows with it or &amp;#34;migrate&amp;#34; to other pillows while sleeping are all the proof I need. This keeps the headaches from starting!</li>
    <li> Useful, sturdy and serves perfetly as a strong lumbar support.</li>
    <li> This works great.  When it came it seemed limp and I wondered how it would do much, but I put it in my pillow and voila.  I could tell a difference right away.  I am a side sleeper and it isn&#x27;t always easy to find that sweet spot.  This roll did it for me. Thanks also for quick delivery.</li>
    <li> My husband is using it for a chronic neck ache.  But, I think it may be just a little narrow for him.</li>
    <li> I have cervical spinal stenosis &amp; I&#x27;ve tried three or four other tube pillows. All were variations of too hard or soft; or diameter too large or small. This is perfect. Neck pain is significantly reduced.</li>
    <li> Perfect! Arrived quickly. Good quality.</li>
