<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was amazed at how good it worked</li>
    <li> In a world with so many &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; products it&#x27;s hard to choose what is right for your face. This stuff just works. At 40 years old, I noticed results in a few weeks of using it. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Good price.product ok.maybe I expected too much.</li>
    <li> Fantastic for old farts like me!!</li>
    <li> I have purchased this brand previously as a 4oz with dropper. I decided to buy the 8oz instead however I received the product but the packaging wasn&#x27;t good.  When I opened it the pump was clearly faulty and open which spilled through the box.</li>
    <li> Waste of my money!  I just break out every time I use this....cheap product.</li>
    <li> I do love it!!  It is smooth, not greasy and works for the fine wrinkles.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue is that it did &amp;#34;leak&amp;#34; a little when it arrived and the packaging was soggy.  Since it is pricey, I was tempted to send it back but in the &amp;#34;clean up&amp;#34;, I did try it and I wasn&#x27;t willing to part.</li>
    <li> I have been using this morning and night for a couple of weeks  with the Derma e DMAE and love the way my skin looks and feels.</li>
    <li> Product is amazing but have to return this one.  It arrived soaking wet,  opened,  and some of the product leaked out.  :(</li>
    <li> I like it but it is to early to give accurate coment</li>
    <li> So far, this product does exactly what the person who recommended it, said it would do.  Very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> It was leaking when I received it. I didn&#x27;t go to the trouble to return it because not much of it was gone. When I use it, the top leaks every time, so I plan to go buy another container to pour it in. The product may be okay, but it should have been packaged better.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product. It really has diminished my wrinkles and my skin is so smooth. I highly recommend this products and I will definitely continue to re-order this.</li>
    <li> Smooth, clean and thick, this is the product for the future. I appreciate the affordability of this product.!</li>
    <li> this is the second time i buy it. excellent product!! my skin are getting bright and smooth</li>
    <li> Great Product... so good in fact my neighbor &amp;#34;stole it&amp;#34; having noticed the difference in my skin</li>
    <li> Apparently my 60 year old g. friend says it is a very effective wrinkle product. i see the difference on her face. It was also mentioned in the TV news ( not as advertisement but as a special) that this formula is effective so I bought it for her and she is happy.</li>
    <li> I love the texture, thick and supple. Then it dries immediately, so I can get a moisturizer on over it and not waste any time! I like the dark glass, to keep light from damaging it. I love the pump, to keep the contents from getting contaminated!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for three days now and I already see a difference.  I am excited to see what things will look like in 14 days.  I have always focused on good skin-care products since I was a teenager.  Now in my mid thirties, I definitely see a change in my skin.  Larger pores, dark/light spots and a tougher exterior.  While I often still get confused for being in my late twenties, I didn&#x27;t want that to end and I searched high and low for a product that would bring back the plump glow to my skin.  So far, I can tell this product is doing the trick and I would certainly recommend it to anyone trying to slow down the aging process.</li>
    <li> Not sure, I bought it for someone else.</li>
    <li> Seems to work, still in the testing stages but feels and looks to be working</li>
    <li> Moistiouses well and not as runny as others.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I have tried quite a few other brands and so glad I tried this one.  Goes on like silk and a little goes a long way.  I actually thought I saw a difference the first time I used it on my decolette and see other areas looking good.  People are saying how wonderful I look.  Two of my friends have started using it.</li>
    <li> I simply adored working with this company.  Even though the product did not work as well for me as maybe for others.the customer service I received was absolutely outstanding and will forever serve as the barometer for how I want to be dealt with by other companies. Stephanie called me several times to see how I was doing, how it was going with the product.  I relayed I was not very happy and she assured me that would be no problem, no hassle return nothing just try it for a few more days. I did and still didnt see any improvement. Sure enough she called me and we had the most pleasant conversation, she guaranteed a full refund and told me not to bother with returning the products. In fact give to a friend to try she said and maybe they will like it more. So, indeed this is exactly what I will do.  I look forward to working with this company again and again and again in the future. Thank You so Very Much Katie H Henderson</li>
    <li> I have very oily complexion.  This keeps my makeup on all day and the oil AWAY!  Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> I like this product allot.</li>
    <li> This is the third time I have ordered this wonderful Hyaluronic Acid Serum....it works very well for me!  I ordered the larger size most recently, because I do not run to have the smaller bottle &#x27;run dry&#x27; on me before I order again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m used to a thicker serum so I tend to use too much. So much so that it starts to peel. I had someone ask me if I was peeling from a sunburn.</li>
    <li> i like it.work for me.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product and use it for my micro needling that I do.  It&#x27;s thick and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I have noticed a huge difference in the quality of my skin.  So much more hydrated since using this product, fewer lines!!!</li>
    <li> It seems watery compared to other similar products I&#x27;ve purchased through my Dr.&#x27;s office.  The jury is still out on how it will compare.  The cost is less.  Sometimes you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I love this outstanding product and I&#x27;m already noticing excellent results on my skin. Thank you for your efficient delivering and packing.</li>
    <li> I am not bothered by the fact that the product dries quickly on the skin.  You have to just stop trying to rub it in once it dries, and then apply your moisturizer.  Seems to work well, however the packaging was flimsy and about 1/2 ounce of my product had leaked out before it arrived.  This is quite a bit to pay for a product to not receive it all.  Maybe the smaller packages will travel better, but you don&#x27;t save that way.  Maybe I will recommend once the packers put a regular top on the product, and pack the pump separately.</li>
    <li> I have only used the product once, but it feels nice on the skin and I am hopeful that it will do what is advertised.</li>
    <li> Great hyaluronic Acid Serum.  Economical and high quality.</li>
    <li> This is pure Hyaluronic acid and something every person would benefit from by adding to their morning and evening skincare routine.</li>
    <li> I mix this with my olay face moisturizer and use everyday after i wash my face, you will notice your skin looking and feeling much softer, it also helps with my acne which I&#x27;ve been struggling with for years, finally i found a regimen that works and this has to be apart of it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good and useful product for my skin both my body and face especially for people who have dry skin</li>
    <li> love it!  It has made a difference with my skin.</li>
    <li> I use this to make vitamin c serum. Excellent product. You get a ton too for the price.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  There is great improvement in my complexion and around my eyes.I have used Hyaluronic Acid Serum on other areas of my body and I&#x27;m seeing great improvement also.&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend that you try this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great addition to my skincare regime</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a week and can already see a marked improvement in my fine lines around my eyes and mouth. My neck and décolleté are smoother. I can hardly wait for the long run appearances, but if they didn&#x27;t get better than this I would still be happy</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for a bit.  I first bought a smaller expensive version.  Since I like it, I bought this larger bottle for greater cost benefit</li>
    <li> I bought pure hyaluronic gel before from England.  The brand is Gengigel, very thick and moist.  I know how it should feel.  When I saw Amazon sells it too, I trusted Amazon, and after reading the description, decided to buy from Amazon.  The front of the bottle claims to be \\&quot;Pure Hyaluronic Serum\\&quot;.  But when I received the bottle, the back has ingredients: distilled water (no % mentioned), hyaluronic acid (no % mentioned), benzyl alcohol (0.5%)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I am buying this gel to smooth my face, why should I want alcohol in it to dry my face?  I could have splashed my face with water for moisture and not spend a dime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bottle is so liquidity that it feels mostly like water.  I usually use pure hyaluronic gel or Aloa Vera,both of which are much more gel like and smoothing to my skin.  I would never buy this product again and will never recommend it to anybody.  Janet Tien</li>
    <li> Good product. Not as effective as other serums.</li>
    <li> Skin feels right but moist.</li>
    <li> It is a good product so far. My skin has changed for  good. But to be realistic, I would hace to use it long enough to really make a Good comment about it.&lt;br /&gt;I do have a review about the bottle. It Should come closed better. When i received it it had spilled quite some amount of it.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t get the results as expected.  Maybe I was expecting too much...  Can&#x27;t see much diiference after use.</li>
    <li> This was my second order of this and I ordered the large bottle this time. I first mix vitamin C w a little rose water in my hand, then I add about 4-5 drops of this and smooth on my face, neck and the back of my hands. I do this every morning. I also use it on the 3 nights I&#x27;m not using Retin A. I then finish w/ a special oil mixture, and finish w/ my moisturizer and eye cream.</li>
    <li> sWas Skeptical as am in upper 60&#x27;s but darn if I wasn&#x27;t surprised after several weeks of daily use at night.  Did find that I had to use a moisturizer over this product so apply a light smudge of virgin coconut oil several nights each week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this for the &amp;#34;repair&amp;#34; of the mantra &amp;#34;clean/exfoliate, repair, moisturize, protect&amp;#34; and it is a good choice for me.  Sometimes, on weekend mornings, I just add sunscreen and eye care and am off and running.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The improvement: don&#x27;t have anything to measure the change but my skin looks brighter and firmer... in fact, folks at work have said I look &amp;#34;fresher&amp;#34;!  How great is that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the first few uses, my rosacea flared a bit after a 48 hour break from using the produce, disappeared and continued use has been fine.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this brand of HA. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Every day I look forward to use this serum! My face feels smooth and looks nourished after each use. I also use on my neck area while I&#x27;m applying on skin.</li>
    <li> Using this with the derma roller. Seems to be working well, I&#x27;m pretty happy with this purchase. Highly recommend. Five stars.</li>
    <li> I really like this! I like to use exfoliating products to keep my skin clear and healthy, and this makes my skin very soft! It doesn&#x27;t seem to have helped my acne too much, but I did notice a positive difference! Although it is extremely watery, so beware. Also, the pump is a bit hard to control; it tends to pump more than I&#x27;d like. Other than that, I would definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell you why I love this, but I do-- The price is amazing. I use it with Vitamin C gel and a moisturizer and people tell me I look 10 years younger than my 53 years, so I guess its worth it!</li>
    <li> I have only just starting using this product so I cannot say very much about it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve given it four stars as I like the feel on my skin and is perfect for me to put&lt;br /&gt;my makeup on, you do not need much as a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This H.A.  serum has made a great improvement in the quality of my facial skin. I have been using it for about 8-10  months.  I use it every evening after a good cleansing-- and often follow with a light coat of Squalane oil. I am 80 years old, have very few wrinkles and am told I look like sixty!  Product is worth every penny-- thank you for the purity of this product and  please do not change anything about it! .</li>
    <li> Very good I couldn&#x27;t been happier</li>
    <li> Great serum that sleeps deep into your skin. I have been using this product for a month and have seen instant improvement on my skin. Very good serum for people with acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it does help making your skin firmer. Sometimes I use this together with jojoba oil, I&#x27;m not really sure if this stuff alone hydrates your skin, firms yes.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin so I needed something to help me with that. Not even the best moisturizers would work. I tried this and it did absolutely nothing. It feels like putting water on your face. Plus it has alcohol in it so that will dry your skin as well.</li>
    <li> I have used other brands in the past, but this hyaluronic acid serum from Cosmedica Skincare surpassed my expectations. I’m seeing great results overall, but more so on my neck.</li>
    <li> I use this in my retinol cream. Not sure if the results are visible but one must do what one can.</li>
    <li> Great basic fragrance free serum for moisturizing and great for the price!!  Would recommend this for beauty junkies like myself!</li>
    <li> This is the real deal, pure honest skin serum. I have used a different far more expensive &amp;#34;brand&amp;#34; for a few years, this product blows the others out of the water. I LOVE it. The vendor ships the product quickly and it is well protected in the packaging. I will be buying This Hyaluronic Acid Serum from now on.</li>
    <li> The pump did not work.</li>
    <li> I love the product it does what it says my only complaint is the bottle, I purchased the large pump bottle and it leaked in transit around the pump.  I lost about a third of the bottle if the pump had not leaked I would have given 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I love how my skin is moisturized and soft&lt;br /&gt;After using this product. I not only use it on my face but my hands and arms. I have used it on my legs and feet.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
    <li> Have purchased this product multiple times, love it!!</li>
    <li> Love this serum.....a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I received hyaluronic serum not packed with filling. There is no guarantee that someone did not open the bottle. There is no guarantee that there hyaluronic serum</li>
    <li> Great product--I will buy again.</li>
    <li> wonderful product.  use on clean face first then mix a drop or two with your moisturizer really works well.</li>
    <li> I used it on my sunburn and it took sting away immediately. Love how it hydrated my face too.  Can&#x27;t wait to infuse it with my micro needling.</li>
    <li> I am not sure why people give this product a high rating, but I read something about the company giving a discount to customers that rate their product high.  It is barely thicker than water and doesn&#x27;t appear to be doing anything for my skin.  It is not moisturizing at all nor does it have any sort of tingling sensation when applied.  Although the product is fairly priced, everything about it is cheap from the packaging to the product itself.  You get what you pay for and I would suggest saving your money for a quality product that will actually DO something. I wanted to love this product, but sadly I feel like it was a complete waste of my money.</li>
    <li> This hyaluronic acid serum is wonderful--it really does what it promises.  It takes such a tiny amount--not even half a pump--for my face, neck, and décolletage, and it really enables my skin to retain moisture.  I use it morning and night, and even occasionally on my arms, hands, and legs.  Regardless of what kind of moisturizer I used at night, I would awaken with parched skin.  Not anymore. I really appreciate a company like Cosmedica.  They make excellent products, tell the truth about them, and make them affordable.  I started using this product in conjunction with their Vitamin C serum around 7 months ago and started seeing improvements within 2 weeks.  Regardless of what kind of hyped-up advertising you see from other companies, this is lightening fast as far as I am concerned. I will be a lifelong purchaser as long as they maintain their (incredibly rare) high standards.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way. Just started using, but can see a difference in the clarity of my skin.</li>
    <li> Always as expected and more - great product!</li>
    <li> Great, awesome serum!! Youth in a bottle!!! I started using this after a rosecea flare up...my dermatologist told me about this and I shopped around and found out this is more bang for the buck!!</li>
    <li> smooth, and soothing.</li>
    <li> ...the pump on the bottle is defective and had to go locally to purchase one, it is a lot of product for the price and hopefully helps my condition.</li>
    <li> good item intersted to buy again</li>
    <li> Looking younger everyday. My skin feels silky smooth and friends notice a fullness where deep lines once were.</li>
    <li> NO. #1 &amp;#62; I never write reviews! NO. #2 I recently received this product and its been truly amazing from day one. Dr. Oz was sooo right!! OMG my skin is amazing!! Really incredible!! With just a small amount needed for each day this bottle will last for a while so don&#x27;t let the price scare you because it works out to pennies a day. NO. #3 &amp;#62; When I received this product there was a very minor shipping issue. The same day I received it I sent an e-mail to the seller, within 20 minutes of the e-mail I received a call from the seller&#x27;s customer service department, WOW. I have never in my entire life experienced anything like this, The lady was so amazing, kind, and so helpful. She took care of the minor problem on the spot. I&#x27;ve been in the restaurant business for 30 years so I know customer service. Wish everyone did business like this company. Ten stars for customer service!! Patrick</li>
    <li> This serum has really helped keep my chronically dry skin stay moisturized.  The consistency is very smooth and a little drop goes a long way.  By way of comparison, I have purchased one other brand , Watts Beauty 100% Hyaluronic Acid Solution, and this serum is more viscous and seems to provide higher quality hydration.</li>
    <li> Recently I have enrolled in the esthetics program.  I always took care of my skin and body and do not find esthetics services to be just pampering.  Taking care of body and skin means reducing daily stress by relaxation and maintaning one&#x27;s physiological and psychological well being. It certainly helps when treatments are performed by using high quality products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic acid is common ingredient in most high quality skin care.  I ordered product to use it when I make customized serum for my at home skin care regimen.  I typically mix in a jar skin softening gel, 2 pumps of hyaluronic acid and 2 pumps of pure vitamic C.  This product is very convenient because of the pump.  I do not have to guess how much product to use.  I just count pumps.  My skin is calm, smooth and soft after the treatment.  Nice size of the jar will insure it lasts for a long time.  I will be definitely back buying more of this product.  I only wish the same company is also selling the equivalent of Bioelements&#x27; Softening Gel I can mix with hyaluronic acid.</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff.........use sparingly</li>
    <li> The first one I received was good, but the second one was like a water  I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> Really great product. The larger  quantity and the pump make this much easier to use. Excellent to use prior to moisturizer. I have eczema and a beard and this product moisturizes my skin while still penetrating my facial hair. I really feel this is an excellent product that most people simply don&#x27;t know about.....and i&#x27;m fine with that.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this.  Same consistency and properties of smaller, more expensive quantity I have used previously.  I have been applying a layer, letting dry, then a layer of rose hips or jojoba oil...let sink in, then my sunscreen.  Nice moisturizing regimen.</li>
    <li> Very good for the price.</li>
    <li> Have been using Hyaluronic Acid serum for a while ordered from different sources. I  think it does have a good general effect. Apart from the product the seller is great.When my package arrived some of the product had leaked out. They sent me another one right away and when  I offered to send back the first bottle the seller told me that it was not necessary. I can use the serum from the first bottle knowing it is ok and that i am not using something that is not mine. I very much appreciate the way they handled the case and enjoy using the serum very much.&lt;br /&gt;Already told my sister in San Diego to order from them and I will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Timeless Skincare&#x27;s Hyaluronic Acid which I love and which doesn&#x27;t include all of the added ingredients as this one does. As for this product, not only does it contain many added ingredients, but it also caused me to have a severe breakout. I did not get the opportunity to return the item in time and lost my ability to get refunded for it. It is an expensive product at an extensive cost, and I will not be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> Want to look younger, use it!!!!  I am a 53 year old mom and my husband has been telling me I am aging backward.  Use in morning and at night.  You can actually see the difference after one use!  And no, I don&#x27;t work for this company or advertise the product.  I am serious about it.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without it  - the bigger size works better for me, I bought the small one for my daughter and she loves it.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 oz and really like it. So I ordered this one. When I got it, the paper box was wet. There are about 1 oz content missing. When I tried to use it this morning. There were liquid came out from outside the pump.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say I notice a difference using this. I&#x27;ve been trying for months now.</li>
    <li> This product seems to make my other skin care moisturizers absorb better. My skin feels softer and texture has improved.</li>
    <li> I was hoping that this product would be a nice hydrator for my skin as the lotion I currently use breaks my face out in a rash. Unfortunately, this isn&#x27;t the case. While the ingredients list is short (purified water, HA, alcohol) the addition of alcohol must be what&#x27;s drying my face out TERRIBLY! I actually look older when using this stuff...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surely something else could have been used besides alcohol, but I&#x27;m guessing that was the cheapest route to take. I live in the Midwest USA, so the cold, dry weather isn&#x27;t helping and I would guess that if it were still Summer the dryness wouldn&#x27;t be so harsh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I&#x27;d love to give this product a 5 Star rating, I simply can&#x27;t as it&#x27;s actually doing the opposite of what I purchased it for (drying my skin out).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I&#x27;ll be trying a different HA product.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it.  My face breaks out easy so it&#x27;s hard to find products to use.  I&#x27;ve always been told my skin is dehydrated because of it.  This really works and it&#x27;s a gel which is best for me.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this serum!  I&#x27;ve had large pores my entire life and I was always self conscious of it... after using this serum for only a few days, my pores are tight and virtually invisible!  I highly recommend this product, I will use this forever.</li>
    <li> Product arrived one day late. I have ony been using for 2 days. Too soon to tell if it is working. You can immediately feel skin tighten, but still apply mosturizer over serum.</li>
    <li> If you want to increase the effectiveness of your daily mositurize, just add a few drops of this amazing product.  I have used Hyaluronc Acid for many years and this one is as pure as it gets.  The price is outstanding and the company used packaging which will keep the ingredients effective.</li>
    <li> I am 58 years old and have deep wrinkles and skin is sagging (yuk). Have an olive complexion and have never used sunscreen. I am out in the sun regularly, yes middle of the day as well. Dumb I know. It is just that when I am working/running when I sweat it goes into my eyes and I cannot see for the rest of the day. I was quite distressed when I seen a photo of myself. It was a moment let me tell you. I thought Botox, but then no I don&#x27;t want to inject anything into my body. I started to check out skin care products I heard Dr. Oz speak of how good that Hyaluronic Acid Serum is excellent for the skin, plumps it up and moisturizes.  I am using the Hyaluronic Acid Serum after cleansing my face. My skin actually feels tighter and wrinkles a bit less noticeable. I use a retinol creme afterwards.I have not had any stinging.  I have only been using for a few weeks and I am hoping to have even better results as time goes by. I am very pleased thus far.</li>
    <li> tis stuff really works i used it every night like it said and it get rid of the wrinkles</li>
    <li> I love this product. It makes your skin feel smooth and very hydrated. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This product is so watery it&#x27;s almost useless. Other similar products I&#x27;ve recently tried are clearly not diluted likes this. This isn&#x27;t serum, it&#x27;s water with some chemicals in it (possibly).</li>
    <li> Works OK but going back to product from Austrailia.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the product. I use it with Vitamin C and my skin looks clear &amp; Brite! Good value.</li>
    <li> This product is quickly absorbed and has greatly improved my skin. I use is on my face and hands prior to applying moisturizer, which seems to seal in the moisture.</li>
    <li> I have used this every day and have to say, I do see a difference in my face. It has smoothed out small wrinkles, and lessened the deeper ones. It makes my skin so soft, also. Love the size of bottle, and it doesn&#x27;t take much, so feel the bottle will last longer.</li>
    <li> I like the product. The dispenser doesn´t work. And maybe I would like the liquid to be a little thicker with vitamin C or E added.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> This is really a very good product without an expensive price.  It seems to help the lines in your face look softer and less noticeable after using.  It last a long time and is very inexpensive.</li>
    <li> First time, it came in a glass bottle with thicker serum but second order came with plastic bottle with serum so diluted, it was practically like water.  I think the seller diluted the product to make bigger profit.  Not really a good way to maintain repeat customers.</li>
    <li> I have just used this product for several days but I must say that it give great hydration to the face. I have sensitive skin and I have no issues with this product.  It is light and nonsticky!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  I don&#x27;t know if it is actually getting rid of my fine lines around my eye area, but my face as a whole looks radiant and healthy.  I also take hyaluronic acid internally, as a supplement, so that might give it a boost as well.  I use this over a freshly cleaned and toned face and then add one of my many moisturizers (I switch mine up every few days...Sothy&#x27;s, Estee Lauder, etc.).  I will definitely continue purchasing this item.</li>
    <li> I thought it was very good stuff.</li>
    <li> It was all I expected</li>
    <li> After only one day of using this product, I have had serious breakouts, red rashes all over my face and neck. My skin is not sensitive at all. I wonder if the company does lab test before putting it on market. I have never seen my face so red and swollen in my life. Do not buy.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1N18L8XF6DUZC]]Reason for Purchase:&lt;br /&gt;-Amount of hyaluronic acid serum for the price is a steal (was paying ~$29 for 1oz)&lt;br /&gt;-It had a pump, for those who&#x27;ve used hyaluronic acid serums before a dropper is ridiculous to use since when you remove the cap your letting the serum oxidize (loosing your money) and droppers aren&#x27;t the easiest to use when trying to put on other products on your face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Impression:&lt;br /&gt;-really usable, mixes nicely with all my moisturizers to give me a non-greasy moisture I like (I only use oil-free products)&lt;br /&gt;-can be used without a moisturizer if at home, keeps face moist without making me oil up&lt;br /&gt;-pump could be designed better for better control over the amount of serum pumped but overall I like the pump, makes my daily routines a lot easier :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendation:&lt;br /&gt;Anyone who wants a multi-functional serum that keeps your face moist without oiling up your face &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Really like this product. It absorbs right into your skin and has left my skin feeling very hydrated. Used it after using my Dermapen treatment. Too soon to see if the collagen in my face will be enhanced.</li>
    <li> Hyaluronic Acid is part of my routine.  Having a huge bottle is awesome - just don&#x27;t spill it!  Quick shipper - GREAT product!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product, Hyaluronic Acid Serum, to use with my derma roller.  I was amazed to find that using it without the derma roller was very effective in managing my dry skin.  In just one week, my skin looked moist and supple.  The biggest surprise was my family complimenting me on my skin!  I will definitely buy this product again from Cosmedico.  It was reasonably priced and even arrived earlier than expected.  Good product; Good company.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I did a lot of research on the benefits of this product and I love it. I can feel it absorbed in my skin and the skin feels so much softer after using it. The shipping was also super fast which I appreciate.</li>
    <li> I really like this serum. It is not greasy and doesnt sit &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; on my face like other creams. I continue to order it and have now started ordering it for friends. Especially ones with rosacea bc it does not irritate skin. My skin looks hydrated and healthy but not greasy. The spas use a pure serum like this one when I go to get a facial but want to charge over $200 for the same ingredient but only half an ounce of it. I am seeing the same results with less expense. No brainer. Great product.</li>
    <li> Too soon to give an honest response, however, I do feel something happening when I put it on.</li>
    <li> Very good quality for the price. I am professional makeup artist and have tried everything out there. This will be what I,m sticking too!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s hyaluronic acid serum and works well to keep skin young - as a part of the skin it creates moisture - don&#x27;t use under the eye for bags as it may make them more puffy - very good product and a great price.</li>
    <li> Good product. Will reorder when needed.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and believed them. I spent $50 on this serum and used it for over 3 months. I went back to my store bought products and my skin is much better. AGING is all I got from this.  VERY disappointed!!!!!! NOT A 1 STAR. I would give it a negative 5 if I could.</li>
    <li> I&#x27; been using this product for about 5 weeks. My skin feel softer and bright. I see big changes and my face and neck.</li>
    <li> I M really not sure if this is doing anything for me. I use in the morning and at night. Just don&#x27;t see results yet. I will wait to use it all before final rating</li>
    <li> I was so surprised that this works! Its the first ever product that I have used that actually eliminates most of my wrinkles! I have small wrinkles around my mouth and some on my forehead. I mix a bit of this with my moisturizer and I use it in the morning and at night. It feels lite, cool and absorbs nicely. Non greasy. I will definitely be using this product for as long as I can get it! Try it!</li>
    <li> Great item! Second time I have bought it.</li>
    <li> Fantastic serum, great price, large size.</li>
    <li> My skin&#x27;s texture and condition has improved considerably since adding this Hyaluronic Acid Serum to my regimen.  I will definitely continue to use it!  By the way,I had to call their customer service about an issue and was more than satisfied with the resolution.</li>
    <li> I THINK THIS PRODUCT IS OKAY.  I DON&#x27;T SEE MUCH DIFFERENCE BUT OTHERS SEE GREAT DIFFERENCE IN MY APPEARANCE.</li>
    <li> I use this serum both morning and night... You can see the difference instantly....&lt;br /&gt;I love it!!  Please don&#x27;t stop selling it!!!!</li>
    <li> very  good,  everything and  more as to expectations.</li>
    <li> I little goes a long way...Love the way it looks and feels on my skin!</li>
    <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchase hyaluronic acid and I really like it. My skin absorbs it quickly and it&#x27;s lightweight. This time I purchased the 8oz bottle as i also use it on other parts of the body. I&#x27;ll be ordering again soon.</li>
    <li> Great size and the price was right.</li>
    <li> Hyaluronic acid has become household must have for me for my skin care regimen.  I purchased 8 oz bottle and I love the fact that bottle has a pump so I can control how much product I use.  I am esthetician and I know how precious hyaluronic acid is for production of collagen and elastic in the skin.  Instead of buying expensive creams I love to make my own mixes of serums with this HA.  I apply it on my skin after toner as a serum and then, especially at night, I keep adding goodies on top of it.  Good vitamins, antioxidants, moisturizers rich with peptides,  I came up with one formula that plumps up my skin overnight.  With daily use, ladies of certain age woudl not need fillers at all.  This serum alone fills up fine lines and stimulateds the skin.  It will definitely provide any skin type with hydration and anti aging benefits.  I am not so dure about brightening.  It may not brighten all skin types.  If you are looking for skin brightener, then look for products with kojic acid.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery.  Great seller. Love this product.  Makes your skin smooth and instantly hydrated.  I use it daily.</li>
    <li> I love using the Cosmedica Hyaluronic acid serum...I think it&#x27;s helped the texture of my skin quite a bit. I ordered my first 8oz. bottle months ago, I use it daily and still have a little left! I do like the way they changed the packaging from glass to a heavy duty plastic too so it won&#x27;t break.</li>
    <li> Wonderful stuff and much more cost effective in the larger bottle</li>
    <li> True to product description. Good price for the amount. Packed and received nicely on time!</li>
    <li> Great product at a FAB price!  I would recommend it to everyone who cares about their skin and a youthful appearance!</li>
    <li> this is a very good product. our whole family uses this.</li>
    <li> I love how this makes my skin look &amp; feel!!! I will continue to buy it!</li>
    <li> it was leaking, when i got it</li>
    <li> Pumps too much at a time</li>
    <li> a little goes a long way, excellent moisturizer skin feels smooth and soft.ffriends comment on how good my skin looks and feels.</li>
    <li> This is the best hyaluronic acid serum I&#x27;ve tried, by far the best quality and value. I&#x27;ve been using a very generous pump of this all over my face and neck (and hands) up to twice a day for five months now and still have lots of the bottle left, and my skin looks and feels better than ever. This is an amazing value without all the additives and fillers you find in other brands.</li>
    <li> This product helped my skin heal after a TCA peel... Awesome results! My skin feels silky and smooth. This serum is perfect for skin hydration.</li>
    <li> Love it, so far. Had a facial about 1 month after starting hyaluronic acid and was able to have a stronger peel.</li>
    <li> my skin is better than before lots.... love it</li>
    <li> I love it. Great Product. Excellent service,,Thanks !!! A++++</li>
    <li> It dried my face out somewhat even with moisturizer. Be careful how much you use.</li>
    <li> Great product for a good price</li>
    <li> Serum is absorbed so quickly and plumps up my skin.  Quality is good and worth price to buy for such a large size.  Poor is that serums leaks out from the cap of the bottle makes the printed box go wet despite there has an outer thin polybag. Obviously, the cap is not closed tight enough and the box sways in the polybag. If the packing is wrapped with bubble paper, it can resist crash from transportation. I wanna buy it again but am afraid of leaking loss again.</li>
    <li> Good. I really haven&#x27;t found one Hyaluronic acid to be better then the next.</li>
    <li> Made a noticeable improvement in my skin. Used with Cellex-C for sensitive skin</li>
    <li> I am loving this product.  my skin looks so much better since I began using this product.  I have been using it for about a week and can tell the difference in skin tone and texture.</li>
    <li> Dosage doesn&#x27;t appear to be strong enough to gradually achieve acid peel ,otherwise it does seem to smooth skin !</li>
</ol>
