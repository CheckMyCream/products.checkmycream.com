### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Excellent product.</li>
      <li>Awesome product, I have curly hair and this is fairly effective when I straighten it</li>
      <li>Works great and helps control the frizz when there is humidity.  </li>
      <li>Spray helps hold your hair style in humid weather very nicely.  </li>
      <li>While I don&#x27;t think this product is specifically better for humidity, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
      <li>My hairdresser recommended this product and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.  </li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>Holds the set nicely.</li>
      <li>Added shine, pleasant scent, and light hold.</li>
      <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE!</li>
      <li>Just a quick spray and forget about the &amp;#34;chance of showers&amp;#34; or tropical humidity!</li>
      <li>I was caught in a light rain and my hair looked just fine.</li>
      <li>It will add some weight and has a really light oily feeling</li>
      <li>It is a light hold</li>
      <li>This works great for my fine, straight hair.. give it instant volume and hold!</li>
      <li>The short wispy hairs around the crown of the head and ends are more calm with the Humidity blocker.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t get hard or sticky, great</li>
      <li>at first I thought it would be like all the others that claim to protect your hair from frizz attacks.  </li>
      <li>This stuff really works!</li>
      <li>its okay, may help if it&#x27;s low humidity but high humidity, not so much.</li>
      <li>Not a heavy, lacquer spray, just a soft veil that keeps the humidity at gay.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t do much as a hair spray either.</li>
      <li>It really does help keep the frizzies at bay.</li>
      <li>Does absolutely nothing for the frizziness.</li>
      <li>Recommend it highly.  </li>
      <li>Works ok made hair stiff</li>
      <li>The broad mist spray covers a large area so a few taps on the nozzle covers all your hair.  </li>

<li> I don&#x27;t use it everyday but definitely on raining or humid days.</li>
<li> I typically like a firm hold hairspray, but since getting a pixie, I wanted something a little lighter.</li>
<li> Not sticky, smelly or stiff.</li>
<li> My hairdresser gave me a small sample of this product to try and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since.  </li>
<li> My hair is impossible to maintain in humidity, and this kept it as needed on vacation in Jamaica, where it&#x27;s extremely humid!</li>

    <li> Awesome product, I have curly hair and this is fairly effective when I straighten it and It&#x27;s humid out.</li>
    <li> Definitely works. My hair is impossible to maintain in humidity, and this kept it as needed on vacation in Jamaica, where it&#x27;s extremely humid! Definitely ordering again!</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended this product and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.  The broad mist spray covers a large area so a few taps on the nozzle covers all your hair.  It is a light hold so it doesn&#x27;t look like the traditional helmet head hair spray look.  The short wispy hairs around the crown of the head and ends are more calm with the Humidity blocker.</li>
    <li> If this stuff can withstand the Texas Coast humidity, it gets a A+ for me! I have thick, wavy hair and cannot normally straighten it if I plan on going to an outdoors event. The Joico Humidity Blocker allows me to do so! Added shine, pleasant scent, and light hold. LOVE LOVE LOVE!</li>
    <li> I typically like a firm hold hairspray, but since getting a pixie, I wanted something a little lighter. While I don&#x27;t think this product is specifically better for humidity, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> This is one product I won&#x27;t ever be without again (unless they stop making it!).  It&#x27;s lightweight, so at first I thought it would be like all the others that claim to protect your hair from frizz attacks.  But no, it works.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Just a quick spray and forget about the &amp;#34;chance of showers&amp;#34; or tropical humidity! Not a heavy, lacquer spray, just a soft veil that keeps the humidity at gay. I have ordered it twice and will continue to order and use</li>
    <li> Seems to work for a while but as the day goes on the humidity does too and the frizz and curls reappear. Not sticky, smelly or stiff.</li>
    <li> Spray helps hold your hair style in humid weather very nicely.  I was caught in a light rain and my hair looked just fine.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. If I don&#x27;t use it on humid days my hair looks like a bush. Holds the set nicely.</li>
    <li> Does absolutely nothing for the frizziness. Doesn&#x27;t do much as a hair spray either.</li>
    <li> its okay, may help if it&#x27;s low humidity but high humidity, not so much.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works! It will add some weight and has a really light oily feeling but it does not flatten curls and style and truly protects from humidity. I don&#x27;t use it everyday but definitely on raining or humid days.</li>
    <li> Works great and helps control the frizz when there is humidity.  Recommend it highly.  Doesn&#x27;t get hard or sticky, great</li>
    <li> This works great for my fine, straight hair.. give it instant volume and hold!</li>
    <li> Works ok made hair stiff</li>
