      <li>I have used John Freida for a couple years, but since I switched to Redken, I&#x27;ve been super happy and will never go back to cheap brands.</li>

      <li>I have super fine hair, so hairspray without water is necessary.</li>
      <li>You really need to try it!</li>
      <li>I have very fine hair that needs a strong product to keep it in place and last the entire day.  </li>
      <li>This hairspray is 20 dollars a can in stores, but I can get two for just a little more than the price of one on Amazon!</li>
      <li>And, it smells great, so you don&#x27;t walk around smelling like a bad 80s hair salon. :)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> after Redken discounted their Spray Starch # 15 i tried a few different hair sprays and finally came across control addict # 28.&lt;br /&gt;I have very thin hair and need that extra hold for hair. works great.....</li>
    <li> It holds amazingly well</li>
    <li> Prefer the Redken 23 as it smells good than Redken 28. Not a bad deal too~</li>
    <li> Was a gift to my girlfriend , she loves it</li>
    <li> Stronger than 18 and no smell. Redken is the only hairspray that I can find that doesn&#x27;t smell awful.</li>
    <li> Older version of the new product.</li>
    <li> I love this hairspray!  I have very fine hair that needs a strong product to keep it in place and last the entire day.  This is the spray for me!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite stronger holding hairspray and Redken is an excellent brand recommended by hair stylists</li>
    <li> a couple of cans were broken and won&#x27;t spray correctly. This is the first time this has happened. i am usually happy with this purchase. not this time!</li>
    <li> Anyone with fine, fly-a-way hair will be very pleased with this product. Hair style stays put and the hairspray brushes out easy. You really need to try it!</li>
    <li> Great product..Holds and its manageable throughout the day!....&lt;br /&gt;Recommend for anyone who wants a good hairspray.. better than anything I tried before</li>
    <li> Love the product love the price.</li>
    <li> Excellent hairspray. Has a very pleasant smell and works perfectly. The price is very good from this seller as well. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This is great if you have fine hair in a humid climate.</li>
    <li> This hair spray is just ok. It&#x27;s nothing special. Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love the product but the packaging was terrible.  The product arrived with the lids both broken.  I waited for them to warm up to room temp and then tried them both and they do spray.  But packaging could be better.</li>
    <li> The spray noddle was broken, I tried to fix it but it&#x27;s really hard to spray.  Other as the damaged top, the spray is very good.</li>
    <li> Great product.  No stiff look but get hold.</li>
    <li> Best hairspray for really think hair. Only hairspray  that will hold my curls. My go to now.</li>
    <li> Love this hairspray! Not heavy on hair but holds well. Redken is a great product and this was a great value.</li>
    <li> Love love love...a little goes a long way and actually does WHAT its supposed to do....finally found a  hairspray strong enough to hold thick fine hair.....LOVE LOVE LOVE!</li>
    <li> Fast shipper, item as described. Thanks</li>
    <li> it good, it very good its just so damn good yo like damn son what u got!? okay i see</li>
    <li> Based on other reviews expected Redken Control Addict to make my hair unmovable after spraying. Not quite as firm as Spike Away, but usable for short spikey hair like mine. Size of can is huge, so figure it will last a long time. Don&#x27;t think I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I believe in professional products and have tried many hairsprays to hold my hair. By far, this product has become my favorite. My hair is fine, and seems soft, so I need something that holds the style. This works!!! Love it</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hairspray.  I&#x27;ve tried many of the Redken line of hairsprays and 28 is the best.  I didn&#x27;t like 23 at all. Their 18, 12, and 16 are the only other ones I will use if 28 isn&#x27;t available.</li>
    <li> awesome! Holds hair in place. I am an RN and work 12 hour shifts. My hair stays in place when I use this!!!</li>
    <li> I use it as a shaping spray then once I aquire my style I use it as a finishing spray the hold is excellent</li>
    <li> Holds my hair style very well. Looks natural and is not sticky.</li>
    <li> Love the hairspray.  It holds the shape of my hair for a long time and doesn&#x27;t become weighted down</li>
    <li> I really love this hairspray.  THE ONLY ISSUE with it is that the head gets clogged quite a bit which means I never know where the hairspray will go when I go to spray it.  As long as people around you shield their eyes, it isn&#x27;t that big of a deal, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have gone to using this hairspray as my main hairstyling product on my shorter hair.</li>
    <li> Amazing deal, amazing hold. Buy it.</li>
    <li> awesome-nothing moves!</li>
    <li> This is the BEST in holding curl in south GA weather...loved it! Trying to get this to submit by typing some more</li>
    <li> I have thin hair that gets oily fast and falls flat when the 7 day look-ahead forecast even dares to mention humidity. I had my girls use this in my hair for my wedding day, and it HELD. Sweat, humidity, hugs, tugs -- you name it, my hair endured it. I think the secret is that it gives body without being a thick spray; hence, nothing weighty to pull your hair down and make you lose all that gorgeous body. Bonus: It costs about $20 in stores, and Amazon sells it for less than $10.</li>
    <li> Was great but the smell can knock you out!</li>
    <li> Lids were broken and taped but product good</li>
    <li> Love this hair spray. No build up and easy to wash out. My hair spray for life.</li>
    <li> Love love love my redken</li>
    <li> Great replacement to Kenra 25. Better control and sprayer doesn&#x27;t get clogged. And the price is better too.</li>
    <li> This is the best hairspray I&#x27;ve ever used.  I have very thin wavy hair and have a long pixie cut.  This has been the only hairspray that keeps my hair from going flat.  I need a little height on top.  I will buy again.  It does make your hair a little hard but if you have fine hair, you need that.</li>
    <li> Awesome and then some.&lt;br /&gt;Less expensive to buy through Amazon than to go to a local salon to purchase this incredible product.&lt;br /&gt;I have rarely raved about a hairspray, so let me just say it works so much better than anything else every used.&lt;br /&gt;Fine spray, holds hair all day long and beyond.</li>
    <li> My favorite  spray for an unbeatable price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll order it again.  It works really well!!</li>
    <li> My beautician tries out different products and she used hairspray  on me and I liked it.  It is called &amp;#34;high control&amp;#34;.  It might have more control then some but I have been using Paul Mitchell which I would say is &amp;#34;high control&amp;#34;.  This does not have the stiffness of Paul Mitchell.  I use a lot of Redken products and like them all.</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised</li>
    <li> Love these products but the hair spray is da bomb. Holds down all the fly aways and is not terribly hard.</li>
    <li> I have super fine hair, so hairspray without water is necessary. I have used John Freida for a couple years, but since I switched to Redken, I&#x27;ve been super happy and will never go back to cheap brands. This hairspray is 20 dollars a can in stores, but I can get two for just a little more than the price of one on Amazon! Shipping is fast; cans are in good condition. The hairspray holds well and doesn&#x27;t get sticky. It doesn&#x27;t cause white flakes, it washes out well, and it&#x27;s even easy to wet hair from the day before and style it without any residue or problems. And, it smells great, so you don&#x27;t walk around smelling like a bad 80s hair salon. :)</li>
    <li> Actually had my stylist use this one me a few times.  I eventually ended up asking her how she gave my hair such good hold, and this product was it.  Very worth it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care for product</li>
    <li> This works nice for me and my baby fine, long hair...with bangs!  I pretty much style bangs with fingers and use a little hair spray and they stay in the general area where they belong!</li>
    <li> I have used cheap hairspray for years, more out of habit than anything.  I  was given a sample of this hairspray and tried it.  I instantly loved it.  My hair typically goes flat within a few hours, but with this hairspray not only can I use it to style my hair, it holds all day.  At bedtime it still looks the same.  Worth spending the extra money, sorry White Rain!</li>
    <li> Firm hold, but the scent is not so wonderful.</li>
    <li> only workedacouple of days</li>
    <li> Smells terrific, awesome hold,  and no residue to weigh your hair down.  Best hairspray I have ever used!  Try it!</li>
    <li> I love this hair spray.  It give great hold without feeling like you have helmet head. Good for humid weather too!</li>
    <li> a++++ Prompt delivery</li>
    <li> Great hold. Great price</li>
    <li> Works well without making hair super stiff and sticky.</li>
    <li> Redken Control Addict is awesome. Not for the faint of heart, this is a serious hairspray that creates serious hold and volume. It&#x27;s a staple in my routine, nothing else I&#x27;ve tried even comes close to the hold this spray provides. Love it.</li>
    <li> This hair spray will hold through wind and rain without looking sticky.  When you need something for an up-do or just to keep hair in place, this is a perfect product.  I have tried many other brands but now stick with this one exclusively.</li>
    <li> Love this hair spray!</li>
    <li> Have used several hairsprays over the years and this is the very best!  It holds without making hair dry and coarse.  It is also easy to brush out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since it came out and can highly recommend if you are looking for a firm hold with a little bit of play in it for styling. Doesn&#x27;t build up or flake which is a plus. Wouldn&#x27;t use any other product, and believe me, I&#x27;ve tried them! Absolutely worth the cost.</li>
    <li> Love this hairspray, super good hold. Highly recommend this!</li>
</ol>
