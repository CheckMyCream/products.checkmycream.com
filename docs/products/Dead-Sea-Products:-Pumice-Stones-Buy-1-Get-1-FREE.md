      <li>Everything I thought and more.</li>
      <li>Love these stones to clean my feet!</li>
      <li>I am not disappointed!</li>
      <li>Love that these were BOGO free..</li>
      <li>It is true!</li>
      <li>These stones are HUGE.</li>
      <li>It is smooth when you use it,though it might &#x27;look&#x27; as if it might scrape you.</li>
      <li>so I jumped on Amazon and decided to give the BOGO free pumice stones a shot.</li>
      <li>I give this 5 stars because instead of getting one free.</li>
      <li>The deal of buy 1 get 1 free</li>
      <li>Works great, lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>They are actual lava rock and so far they work great!</li>
      <li>You should be able to use the stone, (gently), on elbows and knees.</li>
      <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
      <li>After many many store bought failurez, something finally works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It works super well.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I expected, these pumice stones do a great job and look</li>
      <li>Works great to scrub off the rough spots after a nice long bath!</li>
      <li>Large holes do a great job removing skin rough on feet.</li>
      <li>These are very nice, they really help your feet if you have a problem with dry skin</li>
      <li>Great at scraping dead skin off in the shower, can even be used on the face if you&#x27;re GENTL.</li>
      <li>Good and rough.</li>
      <li>They fit nicely in her hand and are not too rough, but just right.</li>
      <li>Other products sometimes peels off more than is safe, but this stone doesn&#x27;t do that.</li>
      <li>I noticed the difference right away.</li>
      <li>It is exactly as it is described, you get 2 stones which is very useful as the naturally occurring differences will help you to find the right roughness for your skin type.  </li>
      <li>Noticed an improvement in my feet after the first use.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s as advertised, gets the job done yet its gentle on skin!</li>
      <li>Works exactly as advertised and it does come with 2 rocks.</li>
      <li>Works much better than a regular pumice</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never had such smooth feet!</li>
      <li>&amp;#34;It&#x27;s shaped FLAT, and therefore more efective than oyjer rounf stone!&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Thank&#x27;s!&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t work very well and has a funny smell.  </li>
      <li>It fits well in the palm of the hand and when used regularly has been able to slowly wear away at the calluses on my palms so that while my grip is strong, the skin is smooth as silk.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve used it only 3 times and found a huge difference.</li>
      <li>Appears to be real and not synthetic.</li>
      <li>It works well and is very inexpensive but beware it will come in wrapped plastic and need to be cleaned off to use.</li>
      <li>Works very well.  </li>
      <li>So really it&#x27;s 1 1/2 not 2 pumice stones for the price.  </li>
      <li>and it really works well.</li>
      <li>the real deal; unlike anything you will find in a store.</li>
      <li>I hope that someone will be more careful packaging this product again.</li>
      <li>My wife ordered these and absolute loves them.</li>
      <li>I use this daily, and feet feel smooth.</li>
      <li>Decent enough, which is had more of a &amp;#34;rough&amp;#34; texture, it is too soft for really callused areas.</li>
      <li>Kind of a waste!</li>
      <li>And this one in particular was so affordable.</li>
      <li>I found this particular stone</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>Sometimes the salons use inexpensive ones and if it&#x27;s busy they don&#x27;t care to get all the dead skin off but with continuous use your feet will be nice and soft!</li>
      <li>I bought this just to smooth off the rough edges, not make my feet baby soft, and it has already really helped the cracking I get in the summer from wearing sandals all the time.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Picture shows foot on the right NOT treated, foot on the left, treated with Pumice.</li>
      <li>Only negatives is that they crumble and have a funny smell, but it&#x27;s nothing you could do to stop that from happening.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pumice, it&#x27;s coarse, it scrapes off calluses pretty well.  </li>
      <li>4 stars instead of 5 because the second pumice is 1/2 the size of the first stone.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s easy to hold onto in the shower and it does what it&#x27;s supposed to without undue elbow grease which is really saying something given that I have callouses which are up to a centimeter thick in some places.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use this with my business helps get rid of those tough rough areas.</li>
    <li> Excellent Amazon seller/. Great product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a pumice stone, what else is there to say? Works as expected, seems like a solid, natural product.</li>
    <li> These are very nice, they really help your feet if you have a problem with dry skin</li>
    <li> Works great! Much better than the dozens of those I have bought from the store.</li>
    <li> Easy to hold even with small hands and it pretty uniform in shape overall. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with the rock flaking a lot and causing a mess in the tub. Works exactly as advertised and it does come with 2 rocks. It definitely needs to be soaked in vinegar water every now and then though to prevent it from smelling or growing anything inside the holes.</li>
    <li> Comes as a set of two.  Nice size.  Work great.</li>
    <li> It is exactly as it is described, you get 2 stones which is very useful as the naturally occurring differences will help you to find the right roughness for your skin type.  I use it daily in the shower and can feel the difference on my feet and elbows immediately.  You do need to be careful as going too hard can cause scratches on your skin, it is a rock after all, and to use lotion since the skin is fresh right after you are done exfoliating.</li>
    <li> the real deal; unlike anything you will find in a store.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected, these pumice stones do a great job and look good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t know it was buy-one-get-one until they arrived, so that was s nice surprise.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a pumice stone and does its job. Fits well in palm of my hand. Yes there is some brown dust, it&#x27;s a rock. Two for the price of one is awesome.</li>
    <li> I wish I would have known the benefits of using a pumice rock sooner. I&#x27;ve never had such smooth feet! And this one in particular was so affordable.</li>
    <li> How long of a review should a pumice stone really have? The picture makes this look like it would be rough and jagged but nothing could be farther from the truth. It fits well in the palm of the hand and when used regularly has been able to slowly wear away at the calluses on my palms so that while my grip is strong, the skin is smooth as silk. Great price, great product.</li>
    <li> I think I went through every one of the so called &#x27;pumice&#x27; stones Walmart carries and now they don&#x27;t even carry they crappy ones. They never have anything of quality so I jumped on Amazon and decided to give the BOGO free pumice stones a shot. I am not disappointed! These stones are HUGE. I was expecting a small stone but these are about 4 inches long, 3 inches wide and a little over 1 inch thick. They are actual lava rock and so far they work great!</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;It&#x27;s shaped FLAT, and therefore more efective than oyjer rounf stone!&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Thank&#x27;s!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Love this!  Its perfect for removing callouses gently but effectively.  The holes are perfect.  It works super well.</li>
    <li> Works very well.  I noticed the difference right away.</li>
    <li> I have bad calluses on my big toes due to the pressure I put on it when I walk or play sports or wear sandals too much. I had a 4 in 1 pedicure tool,but it fell apart or rusted and I needed a replacement. So I thought I&#x27;d just go with a pumice stone since those are the bad boys of pedicure!  I found this particular stone and I must say that it is a natural pumice stone that doesn&#x27;t disintegrate or rub off sandy particles.It is smooth when you use it,though it might &#x27;look&#x27; as if it might scrape you. I only use it every other 4th day and I&#x27;ve used it only 3 times and found a huge difference.I would definitely recommend it to anyone who has tough hard soles.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pumice, it&#x27;s coarse, it scrapes off calluses pretty well.  I develop calluses on sides of my big toes.  I need to soak them for quite a while to get them soft enough to rub off.  Even with these stones it still takes soaking/softening to remove some of my calluses.  BUT this is more controllable and therefore safer than using a a razor type tool.&lt;br /&gt;Only 4 stars instead of 5 because the second pumice is 1/2 the size of the first stone.  So really it&#x27;s 1 1/2 not 2 pumice stones for the price.  Nit picky? Maybe, but I feel the description is inaccurate.</li>
    <li> Leaves grit all over. And did not smooth my feet. Kind of a waste!</li>
    <li> It works well and is very inexpensive but beware it will come in wrapped plastic and need to be cleaned off to use.</li>
    <li> Only negatives is that they crumble and have a funny smell, but it&#x27;s nothing you could do to stop that from happening. Great at scraping dead skin off in the shower, can even be used on the face if you&#x27;re GENTL.</li>
    <li> Love that these were BOGO free.. I kept one and put the other one in my husband&#x27;s shower for him to use.  These are great! They really help slough off dead skin and callouses.  My problem area is my heels.  After using this, I slather on body butter, socks and sleep overnight... feet are transformed in the morning!</li>
    <li> Got two for the price of one, though they come from China</li>
    <li> I mean since they&#x27;re rocks you cant really expect them to all be the same, the price is great but its just up to luck. Mine has holes a lot smaller than the picture</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say I love it - it&#x27;s a pumice stone, not a chocolate cake - but it&#x27;s easy to hold onto in the shower and it does what it&#x27;s supposed to without undue elbow grease which is really saying something given that I have callouses which are up to a centimeter thick in some places. I bought this just to smooth off the rough edges, not make my feet baby soft, and it has already really helped the cracking I get in the summer from wearing sandals all the time.</li>
    <li> Still searching for something that will make a noticeable difference in foot softness. But this any any stone are good for cleaning.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work very well and has a funny smell.  I threw them into my neighbor&#x27;s lava rock garden bed.</li>
    <li> Works great to scrub off the rough spots after a nice long bath!</li>
    <li> Awesome! We love it. Noticed an improvement in my feet after the first use. Good and rough. Appears to be real and not synthetic.</li>
    <li> For those over 30 years of age and who know what a real pumice stone is, this &amp;#34;Dead Sea Product&amp;#34; is a farce!  It&#x27;s not worth two cents!</li>
    <li> I was really disappointed in this as it was not as effective as the pumice product I was using.  Definitely didn&#x27;t help to remove dead skin and was not a good shape to fit in the hand.</li>
    <li> I like that it&#x27;s rough enough to smooth off my heels, but it doesn&#x27;t do damage. Other products sometimes peels off more than is safe, but this stone doesn&#x27;t do that. The deal of buy 1 get 1 free is good too.</li>
    <li> This thing is a lifesaver! Definitely exfoliates the feet and does the job it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    <li> This works great love it</li>
    <li> My mom had one and I loved it so much I had to buy my own.</li>
    <li> Works much better than a regular pumice</li>
    <li> These things look like moon rocks.  Or dinosaur fossils. But they work great.</li>
    <li> Used this twice, no more ugly dry skin on the soles of my feet!</li>
    <li> Wow totally saved our feet !!!!!!! Miracle worker</li>
    <li> Love these stones to clean my feet! Sometimes the salons use inexpensive ones and if it&#x27;s busy they don&#x27;t care to get all the dead skin off but with continuous use your feet will be nice and soft!</li>
    <li> Everything I thought and more.</li>
    <li> Great value &amp; I love the size of the stones. They&#x27;re about as big as a large bar of soap. They&#x27;re pretty rough, but I don&#x27;t mind at all. Great for exfoliation!</li>
    <li> Last long!! Love this!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s as advertised, gets the job done yet its gentle on skin! You get two big rocks for a few bucks. Can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> My wife ordered these and absolute loves them. She did get two for the price of one, as advertised. They fit nicely in her hand and are not too rough, but just right. She has been using it for just over a week now and has already had improvement. Would order again, but won&#x27;t need to for a while. I think this thing will last a LONG time, and then we have a second one to start using. Great product for the price!</li>
    <li> That piece of miracle rock is the best to smooth out the skin of my feet. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t beat the price or the quality of the product. No-nonsense packaging yet arrived in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> They really weren&#x27;t in any packaging or labeled, which creeped me out a little bit.</li>
    <li> The stone is sturdy and fit great in the palm of my hand. Since the one I wanted was sold out this was my second choice, but I would purchase this stone again. I use it in the shower on my feet a couple times a week and it really works well. It arrived quickly, however the packaging was ridiculous. Who ever packed this at the warehouse put it in a flat box and it did not close all the way. It was packed with several other smaller products that could have come loose and fallen out. I hope that someone will be more careful packaging this product again.</li>
    <li> The product works good but leaves a brown mess behind. I have been keeping it over a plastic barrier to keep it staining my bathtub.</li>
    <li> Not great. Pores are way to big and it&#x27;s not gritty enough to shave off small layers of skin (vs tearing chunks off). Can be somewhat helpful if rubbed lightly between hands but definitely not good for managing calluses (weightlifter, climber).</li>
    <li> Works great, lasts a long time. Shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> Decent enough, which is had more of a &amp;#34;rough&amp;#34; texture, it is too soft for really callused areas.</li>
    <li> The rock does provide the promised exfoliation except it leaves a lot of particles in the tub after usage. I realize it&#x27;s a natural stone and this is inevitable however it&#x27;s still annoying to rinse out the tub after</li>
    <li> This is the best pumice stone I have used too. I use this daily, and feet feel smooth. Large holes do a great job removing skin rough on feet. I use it at the end of my shower when skin has softened. You should be able to use the stone, (gently), on elbows and knees. Great price. Great product. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> seem to work ok  but one was broken</li>
    <li> Just do what it do! And Omg I didn&#x27;t read the reviews before buying so I didn&#x27;t know you buy 1 get 1 free! It is true! Very nice stones and ir came in 2 so I would say it&#x27;s a great price!</li>
    <li> Amazing I have horribly cracked feet and this was just what I needed. After many many store bought failurez, something finally works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Picture shows foot on the right NOT treated, foot on the left, treated with Pumice.</li>
    <li> Worked great for scrubbing the toilets.</li>
    <li> Works better than any pumice that I have ever owned and at a great price!</li>
    <li> I give this 5 stars because instead of getting one free. I got 3 free!</li>
    <li> a little rough but does the job</li>
    <li> These were great! A real stone and not the fake stuff you buy in kits.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for the perfect pumice stone- this is it!!!! The crappy too smooth stones from Walmart are just a waste of effort. This stone is great and what makes it even better is that it was a bogo!!!!! My feet feel so soft and amazing and look pro pedi perfect all of the time which is a necessity in sandal wearing Florida! Love this pumice stone</li>
    <li> A big hunk of scrubby goodness.</li>
    <li> Only used it once so far, but I could tell the difference the next morning. It did not leave the tender, sore spots the foot-shaped emery was leaving.</li>
