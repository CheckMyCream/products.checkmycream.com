      <li>but it&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>it is a bit more shinny than the picture which looks matte.</li>
      <li>Looks like really healthy hair.</li>
      <li>I love the wig.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I will be purchasing more wigs from this seller.</li>
      <li>But it still came in perfect condition so it wont stop me from buying my next...</li>
      <li>Still love it.</li>
      <li>So if you like to cut yourself, it is a ok wig for you, but if you just want the hair style as the photos, it might not work for you.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s usable straight out of the box, but for the price and with some youtube tutorials, it&#x27;s a great deal.</li>
      <li>I have received many compliments on this wig.</li>
      <li>but otherwise I couldn&#x27;t have asked for better.</li>
      <li>the cap.&lt;br /&gt;The fibers are very soft and the curls are beautiful.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s true to the color pictured, it photographs amazingly</li>
      <li>This wig came exactly the way it showed me it is so gorgeous</li>
      <li>but you can easily hide them with bobby pins)</li>
      <li>Loved it, highly recommend</li>
      <li>Perfect color, isn&#x27;t quite as dark as pictured.</li>
      <li>dressed up as the black widow and this wig was perfect.</li>
      <li>I ordered the wig alone so it did not come in a box and did not have any type of packing to protect the wig, however when I opened it, the wig was fine.</li>
      <li>a little more of a bright red than i hoped for, but still the hair is beautiful and manageable!</li>
      <li>but it was nice and felt real..</li>
      <li>This is my first wig and I love it~</li>
      <li>The curls are pretty cute as well.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It does have a smaller cap than most but has hooks and is a skin top, the color is a bit more brown than in the picture and looks to be almost a burgundy/brown color rather than</li>
      <li>This is a beautiful wig that has held up extremely well for me.</li>
      <li>The wig looks way too plasticy to wear in public, but it is good for pictures or cosplay.</li>
      <li>This is my absolute favorite wig.</li>
      <li>I love this wig, it matches my hair color very well.</li>
      <li>I wore it 3 times for a full day event, even slept in it once</li>
      <li>Its soft, gorgeous, and matches the color exactly to the picture.</li>
      <li>A great wig, no shedding, I had lost my hair in September and bought this wig, it lasted for about 3 months of me wearing it everyday.</li>
      <li>It fit and looks real.</li>
      <li>Apparently it only SOMETIMES comes with a wig cap, but the sellers are nice people</li>
      <li>It comes in a fairly sturdy plastic bag and has a cardboard frame to protect the wig from being overly crushed as well as having netting, it did not have paper inside</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s definitely worth the purchase for either a cosplay wig or for just wearing around.</li>
      <li>Other than that, the bangs are great and it&#x27;s definitely one of my favorite wigs.</li>
      <li>Some people even thought that it was my natural hair and told me I should die my hair the color--which is a very nice and &amp;#34;expensive&amp;#34; looking color--It is not orange or too bright like some other red wigs can be.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Seems like it would hold a lot of hair under it, but I&#x27;m not worried at all about it falling off despite my own hair being pretty short.</li>
      <li>It is very soft and does not get tangled easily.</li>
      <li>Very realistic!</li>
      <li>Nice quality, but definitely not trying to look real.  </li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s the perfect amount of wavy and is not frizzy or fake looking at all.</li>
      <li>Pretty much ready to wear!</li>
      <li>I absolutely recommend this piece!</li>
      <li>I most definitely recommend this to everyone</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>And more red than the violet</li>
      <li>the dark red wig is beautiful and I love everything about it, especially the color.</li>
      <li>Bangs are really long, was a lot more curly then in the picture</li>
      <li>The bangs are long, but I think that I&#x27;ll just put them to the side so that they&#x27;re more side swept.</li>
      <li>The bangs definitely need trimmed, but the curl is lovely and (fortunately) it doesn&#x27;t even need to be brushed.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve worn it to school for months and everyone thinks it&#x27;s my real hair.</li>
      <li>I wore it straight out of the packaging after just brushing it, and parting the bangs which way</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> There are some pros and cons to this product as there is with any other but it was well over a decent wig, especially for the price. Its soft, gorgeous, and matches the color exactly to the picture. Although it says it is heat resistant, its best not to use any heat tools since it really messed up the wig (I used 100F) I am going to purchase a second one and I won&#x27;t make that mistake again</li>
    <li> Nice quality, but definitely not trying to look real.  I bought this for cosplay, and it was exactly what I needed, and the extra long bangs gave me flexibility to cut them the way I liked. If you are looking for something that looks likes your hair, this is not it however. This is for a good quality costume.</li>
    <li> So very unhappy with this wig. My third one buying off of Amazon and I&#x27;ve gotten a piece of crap twice now. I got the wine red one and still it is very red. I was not aware that this wig was also a middle part- maybe because the pictures don&#x27;t show that and I&#x27;m not surprised.  The bangs are way too long, and usually I would cut them BUT since it&#x27;s a middle part the bangs go two different directions which is unflattering anyways and cutting it would make it worse. Not to mention the picture shows it has little shine but it&#x27;s still quite shiny. Also, it&#x27;s quite thin. Pull hair to front and you see the netting in the back. I wouldn&#x27;t even wear this for cosplay. I&#x27;m just going to stick to MelodySusie. 25$ for a MS wig and it&#x27;s super thick, very long, and the bangs stay in place without clips, also heat resistant. I&#x27;ve worn it to school for months and everyone thinks it&#x27;s my real hair. Don&#x27;t buy from Liz Wig. These wigs are crap.</li>
    <li> Amazing wig its perfect. It fit and looks real. I was even able to cut it into a pixie when i was bored with long hair .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a cosplayer and I bought this for my Poison Ivy costume, and let me tell you, I could not have made a better choice! This is perfect and it feels nice, it&#x27;s true to the color pictured, it photographs amazingly, it&#x27;s the perfect amount of wavy and is not frizzy or fake looking at all. Great for cosplayers and anyone who just wants a really nice wig. A+ quality.</li>
    <li> Hair is very soft and doesn&#x27;t tangle much. it is a bit more shinny than the picture which looks matte. overall it is very pretty and i will get it ago.</li>
    <li> Good quality for the price</li>
    <li> The color is not as burgundy as in the picture. It&#x27;s more of bright red, but still wonderful. I used it for a Vampire costume I did this past Halloween. Afterwards, inspiration struck and I ended up cutting it short, adding layers, straightening it and creating bangs. Still love it. The quality is amazing. And any time it tangles, it&#x27;s not that difficult to comb out.</li>
    <li> my favorite wig of all the ones i&#x27;ve ordered online! a little more of a bright red than i hoped for, but still the hair is beautiful and manageable! had no problems with tangling or shedding like my other curly wigs, and the wig cap actually fits my head over my hair (i have a lot of it) so the wig stays on nicely! would buy again.</li>
    <li> Alright! well, my wig just came in and it was surprisingly early. I ordered the wig alone so it did not come in a box and did not have any type of packing to protect the wig, however when I opened it, the wig was fine. It comes in a fairly sturdy plastic bag and has a cardboard frame to protect the wig from being overly crushed as well as having netting, it did not have paper inside the cap.&lt;br /&gt;The fibers are very soft and the curls are beautiful. I was quite surprised to see that there was a fringe cut into the wig already so it does look like the wig in the photo (it does have bangs that come to your cheeks to frame your face but you can easily hide them with bobby pins) The wig is not shiny and looks quite nice.&lt;br /&gt;It does have a smaller cap than most but has hooks and is a skin top, the color is a bit more brown than in the picture and looks to be almost a burgundy/brown color rather than what you see here, but all in all it is a very nice wig and I would definitely recommend</li>
    <li> Apparently it only SOMETIMES comes with a wig cap, but the sellers are nice people so they offered to give me two caps next time i get a wig from them. I love this wig, the color is great. however, i think it&#x27;s a little too small, though it&#x27;s hard to tell when i cant fit my hair in properly because i am lacking a wig cap. i will probably go with the old stocking trick.</li>
    <li> I love the wig. It is a great quality and looks very real and like healthy hair.</li>
    <li> I wear wigs everyday and I&#x27;ve wanted a red one for a while and I&#x27;m usually kinda iffy about ordering my wigs &amp; cosplay wigs from this site however, I was very pleased with this order! So far it hasn&#x27;t tangled hardly at all and my biggest fear was it being too thin and it&#x27;s not the thickest wig but it&#x27;s decent especially for the price! I&#x27;ve noticed some of the hair falling out but not a concerning amount. Long story short though, I will and have recommend this wig.</li>
    <li> The wig is ok, not very impressed. It is a little bit shiny. However, the color is lighter than photos, also, there is no bang like the photo. So if you like to cut yourself, it is a ok wig for you, but if you just want the hair style as the photos, it might not work for you.</li>
    <li> Not the item I bought. Total different color, not the right length. It looks like a costume wig. It&#x27;s just absolutely terrible. Never buying from them again. Doesn&#x27;t even look like the picture AT ALL. The only good thing about it is I got it before the expected delivery.</li>
    <li> I love this wig, it matches my hair color very well. The hair is good quality and it is soft and feels real, it is not cheap. I feel like&lt;br /&gt; I made a good decision buying this wig.</li>
    <li> The wig gets tangled very easily and looks better in the picture but I gave it a haircut and liked it a lot more after.</li>
    <li> The wig looks way too plasticy to wear in public, but it is good for pictures or cosplay. It&#x27;s stitching is obvious so it should be worn with a hat. You get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I absolutely recommend this piece! Great quality, the colour is as shown and I found it was just as the picture shows eg: semi wavy/curly, if not even better.  There clips to hold it in place too. I&#x27;m very happy with it. My only complaint is the not so fantastic packaging, mine came in a ziplock type bag with a little peice of cardboard to hold the package a little less that flat.  But it still came in perfect condition so it wont stop me from buying my next...I think I&#x27;ll try the purple.</li>
    <li> I was in a really tight bind when a wig I ordered from overseas came in late and wrong so I rushed to order this model and couldn&#x27;t have been happier.&lt;br /&gt;I dressed up as the black widow and this wig was perfect. It&#x27;s very thick and a very lovely red colour that wasn&#x27;t too fire engine. Also, the curls are extremely durable and lasted even when I had to stuff it in my costume bin.&lt;br /&gt;I did however end up having to put some powder on it to tone down some of the shine (a personal preference) but otherwise I couldn&#x27;t have asked for better.</li>
    <li> So cute! This is my first wig and I love it~ The color was a bit lighter than I&#x27;d though it would be, but I think that it&#x27;ll work for my cosplay. It&#x27;s very soft and shiny~. The curls are pretty cute as well. The bangs are long, but I think that I&#x27;ll just put them to the side so that they&#x27;re more side swept. It also came two days earlier than expected (on a Sunday of all days. I didn&#x27;t even know that deliveries were made on Sundays), so I was really happy ^^ .</li>
    <li> This is my absolute favorite wig. I got the dark red one, and I think it looks a little less purple in person then in the picture, but the color change isn&#x27;t too terribly different. The bangs definitely needed to be trimmed a lot, and at first it was too shiny but after bathing it in water with a tiny bit of apple cider vinegar and air drying it - I think it could pass for my actual hair if nobody looked close enough! I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s usable straight out of the box, but for the price and with some youtube tutorials, it&#x27;s a great deal.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful wig that has held up extremely well for me. I love it!</li>
    <li> My husband loves the way the wig looks on me except when it rides. the wig cap isn&#x27;t tight enough. It rides back very noticeably so I have to adjust it often.</li>
    <li> Perfect color, isn&#x27;t quite as dark as pictured. Prefect for Little Mermaid or Jessica Rabit costume/cosplay. Very soft, a little shiny but not syntheic shiny. Looks like really healthy hair. Holds up well with heat styling, I&#x27;ve used my flat iron at 400 degrees and it didn&#x27;t singe it or melt it. Good quality for the price paid. I would repurchase for sure.</li>
    <li> The model in the picture is a ball jointed doll so the wig is actually small, at least the one in the picture is. The one you get will be human sized but nothing like the photo. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
    <li> the dark red wig is beautiful and I love everything about it, especially the color. the sellers are really nice too so I will buy again from them. 10/10 would recommend.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not like the pic&#x27;s !!!! The color n the waves are deffrent !!!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like it , bt the quality is gd</li>
    <li> I love this wig, it is awesome for cosplay. I wore it 3 times for a full day event, even slept in it once and it still looks amazing. Just make sure that you take care of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be purchasing more wigs from this seller.</li>
    <li> I wore this wig to a Halloween party and got so many compliments.  Some people even thought that it was my natural hair and told me I should die my hair the color--which is a very nice and &amp;#34;expensive&amp;#34; looking color--It is not orange or too bright like some other red wigs can be.</li>
    <li> Nothing outstanding but it&#x27;s okay. Bangs are really long, was a lot more curly then in the picture</li>
    <li> The wig itself arrived about two weeks earlier than had been advertised, which I was ecstatic about, only to realize the color is more of a plum brown than a red, but the color itself was still really pretty. The bangs also go straight down when received, but you can brush them to either side or style them fairly easily. The wig needed a bit of brushing and a few strands came out, but not many; strands also being on my clothes when taking it off, but again, there wasn&#x27;t very many as to cause worry.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think this is a great wig and it&#x27;s definitely worth the purchase for either a cosplay wig or for just wearing around.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift for a friend,  she loves it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the highest quality of wig, but it&#x27;s surprisingly good for the price. The bangs definitely need trimmed, but the curl is lovely and (fortunately) it doesn&#x27;t even need to be brushed. It&#x27;s also a little thicker than I had expected, which is phenomenal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems like it would hold a lot of hair under it, but I&#x27;m not worried at all about it falling off despite my own hair being pretty short.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s kind of thicker than the picture? And more red than the violet it looks in the picture. It&#x27;s not a bad wig though, good material etc etc. It&#x27;s just too thick for me. I guess you could gel it down though.</li>
    <li> Honestly I thought this was gonna be horrible because I ordered a wig from them before and it was horrible. This wig came exactly the way it showed me it is so gorgeous I most definitely recommend this to everyone</li>
    <li> I really really loved this wig.  Lasted a very very long time.  Definitely will purchase again.</li>
    <li> This wig is amazing!!! I was worried about ordering a wig online, but this one came packaged wonderfully, to keep the wig in good shape. The color (Dark Red) was just what I had wanted and pretty much what the picture shows, except the curls are not as tight, more loose. but rich color and deep, not too shiny, but for pictures with flash may still need a bit of powdering. Soft and manageable! Very realistic! Didn&#x27;t tangle too much, when it did, there was little brushing needed, without shedding too much, about 15 hairs or so when brushing the entire wig. Pretty much ready to wear! I wore it straight out of the packaging after just brushing it, and parting the bangs which way I wanted them to go. I&#x27;m 5 &#x27;2&#x27;&#x27; and the wig reached my middle back, which made it a bit heavy, but not intolerable. I LOVE this wig and would order more!</li>
    <li> A great wig, no shedding, I had lost my hair in September and bought this wig, it lasted for about 3 months of me wearing it everyday. Loved it, highly recommend</li>
    <li> Wig wasn&#x27;t the same color as shown and it didn&#x27;t fit my head at all but it was nice and felt real.. Either way I will be mailing back or selling</li>
    <li> The wig looks nice, but the ends are getting slightly frayed and I&#x27;ve only worn it a few times. Other than that it&#x27;s really pretty</li>
    <li> I hate this wig not the same color , really really thin ... Fringe is horrible . To short from one side long from another . Not even . I really would like to return it but I doubt I can .</li>
    <li> Amazing wig!! Good quality! Seller works with you when you have problems. By far I&#x27;m very happy with my 3 wigs. Defiantly recommended !!</li>
    <li> My daughter enjoyed it a few times and haven&#x27;t worn it since but it gives her a good indication of what her hair will look like if she decides to die it; which is what she wanted. Served its&#x27; purpose... Thanks!</li>
    <li> It is very soft and does not get tangled easily. I have received many compliments on this wig. It is very good for cosplaying and Halloween costumes, as well.</li>
    <li> This Wig looks just like the picture! It has fantastic curling and just lovely color! 10/10 I would buy it again if I ever had too!!</li>
    <li> Not as curly as the pictures depict. I can see pieces of the wig cap through the hair in the back, but that might be because I pinned my hair back quickly and not as well as I could have. It&#x27;s not very noticeable, but the fact I know it&#x27;s there bugs me. I gently ran my fingers through the hair and got more loose strands than I expected. Other than that, the bangs are great and it&#x27;s definitely one of my favorite wigs.</li>
    <li> One of the prettiest wigs I&#x27;ve ever bought, love it!</li>
