<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> So much better than my cheaper brand of sonic cleaning system. Clarisonic is the best! My skin looks and feels so smooth.</li>
    <li> I had been wanting the clairsonic for some time now and finally received it as a gift this past Christmas. I am thrilled by it. I didn&#x27;t used to break out, but as I got older acne soon became a problem and the clairsonic became a great solution. It helps clear up break outs in a matter of days. The only thing is that I would not recommend using it daily if you have fairly sensitive skin, as it really dries it out. I have also had friends tell me that if used on a daily basis for weeks at a time, it opens pores so much that it lets in dirt easily. So use with moderation- But overall it is a great purchase!</li>
    <li> I LOVE my clarisonic Mia! I had itchy, red, rashy skin with dry patches - sebhorrheic dermatitis on my face! Using the Clarisonic along with a mild face wash has helped immensely. I was afraid it would be too rough for my sensitive skin but it is very gentle and non-irritating. I go in to great detail on my blog about sebhorrheic dermatitis.http://theseborrheicdermatitisblog.wordpress.com/2013/03/24/clarisonic-for-seborrheic-dermatitis/</li>
    <li> I have had the Clarisonic for a few weeks now and my skin has greatly improved. I recommend it highly!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my Clarisonic Mia Sonic Skin Cleanser! It&#x27;s pricy but it is definitely worth it. It definitely helps remove all my makeup, oil and dirt. My skin is so soft because of this product. You won&#x27;t regret buying this product! BUY IT!! :D</li>
    <li> I bought this with high hopes, used it as instructed by the included instructions, with the blessing of my aesthetician.  I bought it in January, but within four months it stopped working completely.  ARGH!  Too late for a refund or replacement through amazon,  I should have bought it somewhere with a better return policy, but I had amazon bucks to spend.  It cleaned well, nothing spectacular for my skin though.  I would NOT buy it again!</li>
    <li> i cannot believe i paid one hundred dollars for this clarisonic. completely stopped working after three months. very disappointed to say the least.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to purchase a Mia because I had done online research prior and found more than a few horror stories. However, I have really painful, cystic acne that is extremely persistent and after trying almost everything else, I was willing to try just one more thing in hopes of clearing my face. I started off using this only once every other day and then worked up to using it once a night and finally twice a day. What began as really hopeful progress soon bloomed into a full on nightmare; the cystic acne that used to be only on my jawline and cheeks soon spread to my forehead and nose. I realize that people who have sensitive skin that is acne prone have to be more careful in their skin care routines, but even trying to break into this slowly didn&#x27;t help. I will say that I noticed that my skin did feel a lot cleaner compared to using just face wash alone, but it also dried out my skin something awful which probably led to that really bad breakout. Also, I was using Retin-A so that probably didn&#x27;t help matters either. Anyway, I&#x27;m sure this is an excellent product for people with normal/oily skin types but I would caution anyone with sensitive/reactive skin to think twice about spending so much on a product that will most likely make matters worse before they get better.</li>
    <li> Since I turned 30 I have experienced an explosion of hormonal acne, especially cystic acne around my jaw line. I tend to frequent my local Sephora store and was told by worker there the Clarisonic changed her face and helped to clear up her mom&#x27;s adult acne. At this point I had tried multiple skin creams, serums. washes and they worked to an extent but seemed to do nothing for the deep,painful acne around my jaw line.&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I received this product I started using it twice a day ( or it suggests once a day if you have sensitive skin) which I consider myself to have, but my skin was fine and did not experience any irritation from it. Almost immediately I experienced a change in my skin texture! My skin felt soft and seemed to produce less oil. I noticed my pores have shrunk completely and the acne around my jaw line completely disappeared after 2 weeks or so of daily use. I like the fact it gives your face such a deep cleaning with the brush alone that you are flexible with whatever cleanser you can use along with it...I&#x27;ve tried the trial size cleanser that came with the brush and it feels great..but the majority of the time I just use Cetaphil cleanser with my brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product so much I have recommended it to several friends and also bought my mom one for mother&#x27;s day. She loves how soft her skin feels!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It has made my skin noticeably softer, firmer looking and with fewer blemishes (in my late 20s). My pores are smaller, but not invisible or completely gone. This isn&#x27;t a miracle worker, but it is the only skin &amp;#34;cleansing&amp;#34; item that has made my skin feel and look better than before. I purchased it after my mom began talking about hers. She &amp; I could see a big difference in her skin, so I knew it would be a good investment. I&#x27;m going on a long trip, won&#x27;t be able to take it &amp; the thought is driving me crazy! If you&#x27;re willing to invest in a skin cleansing system, it is definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had acne for 7 years and tried it all.... Drug store stuff, proactive, and the stuff online. I even tried laser with no luck... Now I don&#x27;t really review stuff but I rather help people out who are in my position... Here is how I use it.&lt;br /&gt;Morning&lt;br /&gt;Use the acne brush with cetaphil sensitive skin cleanser&lt;br /&gt;After mix a dot of clindamycin 1% with neutrogena on the spot acne treatment and rub face&lt;br /&gt;Last use cetaphil 50spf dail moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;Night&lt;br /&gt;Deep cleansing brush with cetaphil&lt;br /&gt;Let face dry for 10 mins then&lt;br /&gt;Tazorac gel .1% from doctor&lt;br /&gt;Then cetaphil SPF 50 again&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 3 weeks i went from sever acne to no acne and I literally mean NO acne.... Even my dermatologist was surprised with how quick it worked and how effective it was. We determined it was the clarisonic Mia that made the difference and he now recommends it to is other patience.. Now I&#x27;m no doctor just telling you my system and experience but this product has changed my life. Well worth the money</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a month now and no change in the clarity of my face. I still&lt;br /&gt;Break out and it hasn&#x27;t cleaned my face any better than my hands.&lt;br /&gt;I bought the deep cleanse head and tried the sensitive head. It just vibrates whiling&lt;br /&gt;Supposedly cleaning my face. Don&#x27;t understand . Thought it would be alot better&lt;br /&gt;Especially since its expensive.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been having some skin issues since I became pregnant and this is really helping to keep it under control, I use it with Burt&#x27;s Bees Acne gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update on my original review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have repeatedly thanked my brother in law for recomending this thing to me, my skin looked FABULOUS while I was pregnant and now its helping to keep the acne under control while my hormones readjust. I don&#x27;t use it for the whole amount of time though, it dries out my skin too much even with the sensitive skin brush head. I also now use Avalon Organics for sensitive skin...once I started with that, everything was awesome. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I really love the Clarisonic, and the Mia size is nice and compact. I even take it on longer holidays. It would be great if it came with an extra brush head instead of the cleanser. Mine got stained pretty quickly, before I decided to use make-up remover all over my face and then cleanse with the brush and my own gel cleanser.</li>
    <li> My daughter requested this for Christmas because she has been having some problems with her skin lately. She says that it works great.</li>
    <li> The Clarisonic device was recommended to me by my facialist, who I have begun seeing recently and regularly to get my acne-prone skin ready for my upcoming wedding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hemmed and hawed about purchasing it, because it is pricey, but the amount of money I&#x27;ve virtually thrown away on various beauty products to try is ridiculous, so I eventually broke down &amp; got it. Plus, I&#x27;m a dedicated Sonicare user, and so knowing this was made by the same developer cinched the deal for me. My pre- and post- Sonicare dental records speak for themselves, so I was hopeful that Clarisonic would be the same thing, but for my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it, I was disappointed -- reading all of these reviews, I expected nothing less than a magazine photoshoot-ready face by the time I was done, and was sad to see just my average, normal face in the mirror. Although it was clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I got over my unrealistic expectations, I was able to appreciate the Mia for what it is, and accept it for what it isn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It ISN&#x27;T a magic bullet -- just buying the Mia and expecting it to suddenly change your (face&#x27;s) life is silly -- it can&#x27;t do all of the work on its own. You still have to find a cleanser that works for you, a moisturizer that works for you, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It IS a great enhancer to your skin care routine, though -- I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin does absorb my moisturizer much more easily after using the Mia (I apply moisturizer every time I wash my face, Mia or no Mia), and I&#x27;m having to use less of my fancy-schmancy face wash (read: expensive face wash, so I&#x27;m saving $$). Using the Mia takes my already good skin care routine and takes it to the next level, so to speak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I can say for sure:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It&#x27;s a great size - solid &amp; easy to hold, but not bulky. The waterproof-ness of it is a great feature&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) It feels excellent on the face. If you&#x27;ve used Sonicare, it&#x27;s very similar -- that sonic  vibrate-y goodness makes you feel like you&#x27;re getting a facial massage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) It leaves your face feeling silky-smooth. That much I noticed after the first use. I never would have said that my skin was \\&quot;dry\\&quot; or \\&quot;flaky\\&quot; before, but that&#x27;s because I didn&#x27;t realize how smooth it could be!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Your face gets clean. Is this because the \\&quot;sonic technology\\&quot; is vibrating the dirt right out of your pores, or because you&#x27;re just washing your face for longer than usual? I don&#x27;t know, and I don&#x27;t really care. Just like the Sonicare forced me to be a better tooth-brusher, the Mia makes me a better face-washer, which has its own benefits, including cleaner skin which leads to more rejuvenated cells, less breakouts, etc. Perhaps I could achieve the same result with a washcloth and a full 60 to 90 seconds of scrubbing, but I won&#x27;t, because I just am too lazy for that. Did I just admit I&#x27;d rather spend $120 on a gadget to wash my face for me because I&#x27;m too lazy to do it myself? Yes, yes I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) The Mia has, as of yet, failed to give me the airbrushed look I was hoping to get (based on other reviews). So that&#x27;s a bummer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just a really good cleansing wand, and I have no doubt that it is doing lots of good things for my skin, because it&#x27;s part of an entire good-skin regiment. I don&#x27;t regret the purchase at all, and really love using my Mia.silky-smooth. That much I noticed after the first use. I never would have said that my skin was \\&quot;dry\\&quot; or \\&quot;flaky\\&quot; before, but that&#x27;s because I didn&#x27;t realize how smooth it could be!  4) Your face gets clean. Is this because the \\&quot;sonic technology\\&quot; is vibrating the dirt right out of your pores, or because you&#x27;re just washing your face for longer than usual? I don&#x27;t know, and I don&#x27;t really care. Just like the Sonicare forced me to be a better tooth-brusher, the Mia makes me a better face-washer, which has its own benefits, including cleaner skin which leads to more rejuvenated cells, less breakouts, etc. Perhaps I could achieve the same result with a washcloth and a full 60 to 90 seconds of scrubbing, but I won&#x27;t, because I just am too lazy for that. Did I just admit I&#x27;d rather spend $120 on a gadget to wash my face for me because I&#x27;m too lazy to do it myself? Yes, yes I did.  5) The Mia has, as of yet, failed to give me the airbrushed look I was hoping to get (based on other reviews). So that&#x27;s a bummer.  It&#x27;s just a really good cleansing wand, and I have no doubt that it is doing lots of good things for my skin, because it&#x27;s part of an entire good-skin regiment. I don&#x27;t regret the purchase at all, and really love using my Mia.</li>
    <li> This may be a good product...not sure.  My charger didn&#x27;t work when I got it and when I called Clarisonic to ask for a replacement, I was told the warranty isn&#x27;t valid unless purchased through an authorized seller, which Amazon is not.  I was able to return the item through Amazon and they paid for the shipping.  I ordered using Amazon Prime so I&#x27;m not sure if the free return was a perk or standard.</li>
    <li> I bought this item on the recommendation of my dermatologist.  After using it daily for a couple of weeks my skin is much softer and has a clearer and younger appearance.  It feels really good during use except on the nose, which tickles and makes you sneeze.  However, as time passes this lessens.  It takes a full 24 hours to re-charge, so be forewarned.  I do heartily recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on friends recommendations and I am so glad I did! It makes my face so smooth and it has never been clearer! It charges quickly and the charge lasts a long time so I always take it with me when I travel! I have recommended this to other friends and my mom and they all love it too!!   Make sure you change the head as recommended for best results too!</li>
    <li> I got this product for my birthday and I really love it.  It makes my skin feel very smooth and clean.  The pores of my skin have noticeably decreased in size and my skin looks healthy with my wrinkles not as noticeable.  I would recommend this product to everyone.  The small size of the Mia is great for travel because I would definitely not want to be without it.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this product, but my dermatologist recommends it so I thought I would give it a try. At age 61 I was afraid it might be too harsh for my fair skin, but it isn&#x27;t at all. I&#x27;ve only used it for about three weeks, but I&#x27;m convinced by skin is smoother and a bit brighter. I&#x27;m definitely glad I purchased it.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my daughter and she really likes it, she says it makes her face tingle.</li>
    <li> I like the Mia for it&#x27;s smaller size and portability.  My sister has the Clarisonic Plus, but I am much more frugal than she is so I bought the Mia for the better price tag.  There are some considerable differences between the 2 products, here are a few:    1) One cycle runs for 1 minute then turns off on the Mia.  You are able to set the cycle for the Plus for 1 or 2 minutes.  Additionally, the Plus beeps when you are supposed to move to a different area of your face.  You can always just run the cycle again on the Mia if it&#x27;s not long enough though.    2) The Mia is smaller, though the brushhead is the same diameter.  The Mia is also much lighter than the Plus.    3) The Mia has a powercord (attaches magnetically to the unit and is waterproof where it attaches), the Plus has a cradle.    4) You cannot use the body brush with the Mia (biggest disadvantage for me, as I didn&#x27;t realize this when I purchased it).    All in all, if you are just planning to use the brush to cleanse your face and don&#x27;t need the body brush, then I think the difference between the two doesn&#x27;t warrant the large hike in price.</li>
    <li> This item only lasted one year for me. It kept randomly turning on and was driving me crazy. No matter what I did, I couldn&#x27;t get it to turn off. Finally I slammed it on the ground to make it stop and it broke. I normally don&#x27;t get this frustrated with technology, but plugging it in, hitting the buttons, and waiting for it to run it&#x27;s cycle didn&#x27;t work, so I gave up.  Not worth it to me since the warranty didn&#x27;t cover the item for that long.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after going through my second Olay version and a drug store version too.  I should&#x27;ve spent the money and just ordered this first.  I saw a difference in my skin after the first use and huge improvements in just 3 days.  This sonic cleaner got rid all the makeup and grime in my pores without any effort.  My skin has never felt so clean!  I&#x27;d recommend this product to any of friends looking to improve their skin!  What a fantastic product!!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! Even my husband has been hooked on using this. Your skin will feel so amazing after the very first time you use it. If you care about your skin and want the best for it, then invest in this little tool. You will be very happy you did. I have only used it with the sensitive brush thus far, and it really cleans much better than just using your hands. I was using cleansing cloths prior to, which are more thorough than just a cleanser and I notice a big difference from using the Mia. It is the best investment I&#x27;ve made for my skin. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I love it! Been using for over two weeks now, and I can see such a difference in the texture and look of my skin.  I&#x27;m definitely experiencing some of the breakouts others have mentioned, but am confident that will end as my skin is finally purged.    Make up goes on so much easier, and I have to use way less foundation.  I have sensitive skin and this hasn&#x27;t been too rough for it at all!  Also VERY happy I went with the Mia over the more expensive models...a timer would be neat, but you get into your own pattern very quickly and soon know when the minute will be up.  Also, I can&#x27;t really imagine the utility of more speed settings.  The Mia gets the job done for a lot less!  You do have to charge it for long periods of time, but this really doesn&#x27;t bother me so it hasn&#x27;t affected my rating.    Just a note on the price; I&#x27;m living abroad in Australia right now, and this was by far the cheapest place to get the Mia (including shipping).    Bottom line - money extremely well spent!</li>
    <li> Received this as a gift from my make up artist friend who raved about this product. I have acne prone skin so I use the Clarisonic with the products of my choice (Philosophy on a clear day system) It definitely helps with the tone and texture of skin and my make up goes on flawlessly since Ive been using this. Also removes makeup effortlessly which I love.</li>
    <li> After using this almost every night for about a month-and-a-half, the last remnants of any acne have disappeared (finally!). I am on prescription topical acne medication, too, but I had been for years previous to using the Mia. My dermatologist recommended the Mia because it helps my topical medications absorb more, therefore they work better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before using this, I would still have outbreaks across my forehead and my jawline. Now, the bumps and breakouts are almost all gone. Also, a lot of my scarring has faded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it hurts my face slightly. I didn&#x27;t take off any stars for this, though, because my face is extremely sensitive, so it might be just me. And it doesn&#x27;t hurt too much for me to not use it. I just can&#x27;t use it for the whole minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did NOT like the cleanser it came with. It did not properly remove my makeup, even with the Mia brush scrubbing at my face. I use [[ASIN:B004DK57M4 Neutrogena Naturals Facial Cleanser, Purifying, 6 oz.]] with the Mia and it works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck! I fully recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****UPDATE - March 20, 2012*****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After many months of using the clarisonic, I can, without reservation, say that it does so much for my skin. I went without using it for about a month because I lost my charger, and all the little bumps and acne on my face came back. Once I started using the clarisonic again, my face cleared up! I also replaced my brush head with the one for ultra-delicate skin ([[ASIN:B000UPRSKA Clarisonic Replacement Brush Head (Delicate)]]) and it hurts my sensitive skin less.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by a friend and I am thrilled to own it.  My skin looks and feels great and at 51 I am getting compliments on how great my skin looks all the time.  I am now recommending it to all my friends...love it</li>
    <li> I was on the fence about purchasing the Clarisonic Mia for about a month because of the price. However, I am so glad I did! I had a lot of small bumps and whiteheads on my chin and forehead area that acne medication, perscriptions, and trips to the dermatologist couldn&#x27;t solve completely. I bought the Mia and have been using it for a month now and it has been amazing. I haven&#x27;t had a breakout since. Although I do have the occasional pimple, all of my bumps are almost completely gone or no longer noticable. I also had really oily skin and the Mia has taken care of that. Instead of reapplying powder three or four times a day I only have to do it once now after about 8 hours of work. I also really like the fact that it removes my makeup completely. I used to only use my hands to wash my face and didn&#x27;t even realize how much dirt and makeup I was missing. This is a really great product and I highly recommend it for anyone still on the fence about purchasing it.</li>
    <li> Got here in record time. I love the clarsonic, leaves my face so soft and feeling clean, and also love that I can take it in the shower and don&#x27;t have to worry about it getting wet!</li>
    <li> This is the greatest thing since sliced bread! For the first time, I feel like the blackheads are getting under control. It gets into those pores quite nicely.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s OK, will keep using it but there are other products out there that do as well but are less expensive</li>
    <li> I called Clarisonic to get a replacement and was told that Pro Tonic, third party dealer I purchased this from, is not an authorized dealer o Clarisonic products and what I had purchased was most likely not a Clarisonic.  So, I am out big bucks for a product that is not really what I thought I was buying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line - purchase a REAL Clarisonic Mia from Clarisonic or QVC...</li>
    <li> I liked it, the price is very favorable, will come back, would recommend to a friend，I liked it，I liked it</li>
    <li> I received the Mia as a Christmas gift and I love to use it in the shower. I do have one concern though and you who are reading this and thinking about buying one should know: when you charge it (and you&#x27;re supposed to for 24hrs upon first use)it MAKES NOISE.  It makes a small, pulsing, chirping noise like a cricket.  This may not be a problem for those of you with big houses where you can plug it in to charge somewhere far away from where you are, say, trying to sleep.  But if you have an apartment and don&#x27;t have that option, argh! Annoying. Otherwise, it is a good product (I just don&#x27;t know why they thought it would be a good idea to have it chirp annoyingly while it is charging).</li>
    <li> This product seemed to work great at first. I only used it once every few days, but after about 6 months, it just stopped working. The brush wouldn&#x27;t move anymore although the device seemed to be on. It seemed jammed and the return window expired after 2 months. So, it worked fine while it lasted, but be careful because for over $100 you would think this thing would last a while.</li>
    <li> This is not a real Clairisonic! It looks exactly like the real thing but it isn&#x27;t. Unfortunately I found this out the hard way. I bought this for my daughter for a Christmas present, and she used it for the better part of a year. When it broke, she called up Clairisonic, gave a serial number, and was told it was a fake. I see that this happened to others here on amazon. I am in the process of trying to get my money refunded from Amazon, but so far no luck, although I have heard other reviewers were able to get refunds. I gave it 2 stars because before it broke, it worked for her, but it didn&#x27;t last. I would purchase Clairisonic products from an authorized dealer only in the future!</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift and was skeptical it would be worth its price. I saw significant change in the tone and clarity of my skin in less than a month. The clincher was when others complimented my skin, unprompted. I was also hesitant to add yet another step to my skin care routine but it&#x27;s very quick and easy. I would recommend it to anyone thinking about purchasing this.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I have sensitive but combination skin, and most soap products are too harsh for me. I was able to use this with a gentle face cleanser and it has really cleared up my skin. I&#x27;d highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Bought this Clarisonic skin cleaning system for my wife, and she loves it. Works great and she would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Okay, I was skeptical and resisted buying one until I realized my skin needed &amp;#34;something.&amp;#34;  A week later and my skin looks great and I am amazed.  Yes, it does what it says - all the hype is true.  Don&#x27;t wait like I did - buy it already!</li>
    <li> My husband bought this for my birthday in February.  I have used it daily ever since, and just had someone ask me how I got such beautiful skin.  Big news for someone with a history of cystic acne and lots of hyper/hypo pigmentation-both of which have always made me self-conscious.  I&#x27;m not saying the scars or discoloration are gone, and I do use prescription-strength skin products.  But I think it might help make the products more effective (as advertised), and my skin is so much softer than it was before.</li>
    <li> My face feels like a babies bottom. I have sensitive skin and breakout easily so I also had to by the delicate brush heads. I used the sensitive one which comes with it for the first week and broke out badly but now skin is back to normal using the delicate brush heads and the pores on and around my nose seem smaller. I was using it twice a day but scaled down to once which also help, for me twice is too much. I definitely feel my skin is a lot cleaner and softer. I look forward to using it every day.  It doesn&#x27;t drastically change your skins appearance but it makes if feel so much better and I think in the long run it will help to keep it clearer and smooth.</li>
    <li> I have really seen a difference in the texture and quality of my skin after using the Clarisonic Mia Sonic Skin Cleansing system.  I have fair, somewhat sensitive skin and am over 50 years old.  I was looking for a way to get a glowing skin texture with even skin tone.  Moisturizers were not enough, even using the most expensive brands.  I have used retin A products which are good but make my skin peel too much, leaving a snake skin molting appearance.  Within two weeks of using this product I was able to get the effect I was striving to achieve.  Small wrinkles are gone and my skin looks silky and luminous.  My pores are cleaner, clearer and smaller in appearance. I am a big advocate of this product!!</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife, and it seems that she loves it.  She wanted it after reading Lauren Conrads facial regimen.  So far so good. Cannot comment on the longevity yet, but hope that wont be an issue.  Amazon was the cheapest by about $10 or $15.</li>
    <li> I got this for my sensitive face and my wife enjoys it even more!  (We have two heads and one device).  My face does not need any additional chafing or irritation.  This product does not irritate it at all.  The Mia somehow promotes oils to be produced through the pores so they don&#x27;t accumulate or cause blackheads or pimples.  I have seborreic dermatitis and I look forward to using this 2-3 times a day to keep that at bay.  This product also relies on a face soap that works for you.</li>
    <li> While the clarisonic does remove alot of dead skin, it also leaves my skin more oily. It did not clear out blackheads nor shrink my pores as promised..... In short, don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> Works great! Face feels really clean. Please be sure to fully charge when using. Charge ran out early the first time.</li>
    <li> WOW!! After months of a particularly bad flare-up of my seborrheic dermatitis, I was ready to try anything. For years I&#x27;ve used an array of foams, lotions, cleansers, gels and soaps to treat my irritated, red, flaky nose.   I&#x27;d read such rave reviews about the Clarisonic, I figured I&#x27;d add it to my Amazon Wishlist. Santa delivered and I received the Mia this Christmas--right in the middle of a massive flareup. Though my dermatologist recommended I avoid my \\&quot;problem\\&quot; nose, I was desperate and used the Mia all over my face...including my NOSE. After a day of sensitivity, I started to notice a difference.   I know better than to get too excited when it comes to seborrheic dermatitis, but I kept using my medicated sulphur cleanser AND the Mia. Within a few days, my nose was flake-free!    All the cleansers and lotions and potions in the world...and it took the Mia to see actual results. I&#x27;m not 100% cured (that&#x27;s impossible with seborrheic dermatitis) but my nose (and the rest of my face) is baby-soft. Something I haven&#x27;t seen in ages!!    I don&#x27;t go a morning or evening without it--one night I was too \\&quot;tired\\&quot; for the Mia and left a sad imprint of my makeup-ed face on my towel. I&#x27;ll NEVER do that again. I&#x27;m hooked!    I love my Mia--compact and great for travel.</li>
    <li> I have been struggling with adult acne for the last four years. I have really sensitive skin so exfoliating and using medications have been an uphill battle for me. The Mia (with the sensitive skin brush) is gentle enough that it does not make my face red or break out yet it exfoliates all the dead flaky skin from using BP and Retinol. I have only been using it for about 4 weeks, so I still have a few break outs and who knows if this thing will \\&quot;cure\\&quot; my acne, but it has made my cleansing process much more effective and my lotions and serums go on like a dream!! I will definetly be keeping this product and have already made it a staple in my skin care regimen.     I use  Dr. Schwaubs Herbal Foaming Cleanser to remove my makeup (great stuff btw) and then follow that with my M2 Exfoliating Cleanser (The whole M2 line is AMAZING!) applied with the Mia for 1 minute on my face and then an additional 1 minute on my neck. I switch between Dr. Scwaubs AM/PM Moistuizer, M2 Recovery Lotion, Dr. Grandel&#x27;s Phyto Care depending on how much hydration I need that day. I have seen the best results in years with this routine and am hoping that I am on my way to facial recovery. I wll come back and update this in 3 months to let you guys know how its going! Wish me luck and most importantly beautiful skin!!!</li>
    <li> I finally decided to invest in this product to see if it reduced the visibility of my pores. I was skeptical but am amazed at the improvement in my skin!  Not only are the pores less visible, but my skin is softer than ever.  It&#x27;s also really convenient that it can be used in the shower…no mess on the bathroom mirror.  The smallest amount of face product lathers up and cleans my whole face.  No need to wonder if I&#x27;m using it too long or not long enough…it has an interior timer that automatically shuts the device off after 1 minute.  This was worth the investment. I highly recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> The warranty is for just one year, and coincidentally, mine died completely right around that time.  It&#x27;s a nice product but for $100 I&#x27;d like to see it last longer.</li>
    <li> Wow! This is the best skin care product ever purchased! It feels so nice, leaves skin noticeably cleaner and softer every use. The claims of products being more effective with regular use of the Clarisonic is true, The improvement was visible within the first week!&lt;br /&gt;The sensitive brush heads are gentle and leave the skin feeling refreshed without being harsh. Wish I had tried it sooner! Will definitely upgrade to a multi- speed model soon, keeping this one for travel.&lt;br /&gt;Pores are appearing smaller, lines are reduced, and my skin looks younger than prior to using this!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I would recommed his product to anyone. Your skin is silky smooth and very clean after use. I like that fact that is shuts itself off after 1 minute so you don&#x27;t have to guess when you are done using it.</li>
    <li> **Summary**Great purchase, great product, no issues with delivery/packaging!**&lt;br /&gt;Purchased this after watching many YouTube videos on the use of it, with glaring reviews. It comes with one sensitive brush head, a facial cleaner (which I still have not used) and a cool magnetized ac adapter. It cleans my face, neck and decolletage well. I concentrate it around my mouth were I have excess sebum production. It only has an on/off button, one speed and stays on for 60 seconds before turning off automatically; I just turn it on again. I use this as needed, I started out using it twice a day, now I only use it after wearing a full face of makeup or when sebum clogged pores are an issue (2-3 times a week). I did not see in the instructions on how to clean the brush head so I run it under hot water, using my hands and a drop of soap to clean it, then i spritz 99% alcohol on it to sterilize it.</li>
    <li> Got it for my wife and she loves it. I think it would be a good gift or just a nice surprise for someone with skin issues.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used mine off and on for a year now and I haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference either way. It won&#x27;t do anything for cystic acne and It doesn&#x27;t exfoliate, but that should be obvious. I don&#x27;t understand the hype with this thing.</li>
    <li> This product is a must have for aging skin that may also be prone to acne.  After one use I was hooked!!!  I will try to continue updates on this product but for the most part I am extremely happy!!!!</li>
    <li> I, like many of you, have constantly only heard great things about the Clarisonic Skin Cleansing System.  The fact is, it&#x27;s very pricey - which always has stopped me from purchasing. I recently changed career paths, where now I am constantly traveling all over the country...which means constant airplane rides and drastic climate change...which you guessed it - leads me to CRAZY, DRY AND UNPREDICATBLE skin.  So, I finally gave in and bought the Clarisonic just a couple days ago to try to regulate my skin. I have only been using it 3 days and I am already noticing a huge change in my complexion.  My skin GLOWS...and my makeup goes on beautifully. My skin is absorbing my face lotion in a way I have never experienced before because the Clarisonic gets deep down into my pores and picks up all the icky grime traditional makeup removers just can&#x27;t remove by hand.  I seriously cannot believe I waited so long to buy this product.  It is a beauty MUST-HAVE.  My skin routine will never be the same again!!  Love, love, love it!</li>
    <li> Like many others reported, mine stopped re-charging after 3-4 months.  Clarisonic was difficult to reach...the complaint department seems to be VERY busy!  I never did get through.</li>
    <li> I would not buy this prodcut. I would not buy this product from Amazon. I would DEFINITELY not buy this product from thomasholt. I spent $100 for the Clarisonic Mimi. After about 62 days it broke. I could not turn it on or on, but it would turn on by itself (kinda creepy when you suddenly start hearing this thing vibrating across a table out of the blue). Because it was purchased from Amazon, Clarisonic does not honor a warranty. Becuase it was after 60 days, I could not return it to Amazon. Becuase I purchased it thru ThomasHolt I was completely out of luck - the guy didn&#x27;t even respond to my email. If you are going to buy this product, spend the extra $20 and buy it though a different channel.</li>
    <li> I bought mine in October  2011. It stopped working in January 2012. Little light goes on showing it charging but does nothing when i try to turn it on. It just quit working one day. Now i have to figure out what to do with it. Try to return it which i think time has expired for return (just like when your car breaks down after warrantly expires) Has anyone else had this problem with it just stop working one day?  When it was working I think it helped some but not the rave reviews others gave it. My pores did not appear smaller. Maybe I needed more time to use it before that happened. Would I get another, maybe it it were cheaper</li>
    <li> I have used this for more than six months and have mixed feelings about the purchase. On the one hand, I like the feeling that it gives of really cleaning deeply. But, on the other, there are two problems. The first is that my skin is not very much better than it was before. The best I can say is that there were some small patches of persistent flakiness that the clarisonic did clear up. And, secondly, it is difficult to thoroughly clean the clarisonic. It is wet when you use it (of course) and it stays wet. You&#x27;re supposed to change the brush regularly, but that doesn&#x27;t address the mechanism that moves the brush. I&#x27;ve cleaned the mechanism a couple of times, but it is still growing mildew/mold which is pretty disgusting. A washcloth costs less than a dollar, and you can throw it in the laundry every couple days, so you know it&#x27;s really clean.</li>
    <li> I have read a lot good reviews about this product and wanted to try for myself because I am always taking care my skin so I can look younger longer, anyway I&#x27;m 33 and I have use this brush twice so far and already see the difference. My face looks clean, fresh and absorb my cream very well after. I&#x27;m very happy with!</li>
    <li> I bought a Clarisonic Mia that broke within 2 months of use from the seller listed above (wachegenas) and it appears to be a real Clarisonic. Today it stopped turning on and will not charge. Sometimes it will turn itself on and and I can&#x27;t get it to turn off. All this is just after the return window has closed for Amazon. I&#x27;m not sure what is wrong with the device but I&#x27;ve learned my lesson: DO NOT BUY HIGH-END PRODUCTS FROM AMAZON SELLERS. PERIOD. I beleive this is a real Clarisonic that may have already been returned for being faulty. Or may have always had a defect and they sold it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My next Clarisonic (and I will buy another because while it worked, it worked VERY WELL) will be purchased from Sephora or Ulta.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that provides a deep cleaning you used to only be able to get at a spa.  I can see the make-up coming off as I cleanse with the clarisonic mia.  I have acne prone skin and have noticed a reduction in my break outs and have only been using this product for a few weeks.  That was my motivation for purchasing it and I&#x27;m glad that I don&#x27;t regret my decision.</li>
    <li> You probably are all wondering about that clarisonic brush that has gotten great reviews from dermatologists, people, and the media. Well I am here today to tell you it&#x27;s not all what it&#x27;s cracked up to be. Listening to all these great reviews I was super eager to buy one, though a little bit discouraged by the price. When I finally got one it was from my grandparents in May before prom. You could say it was an early graduation gift! I was super stoked I had finally received the 200$ cleaning system that was supposed to work wonders. I couldn&#x27;t wait to run home and try it. When I finally got home I ripped open the box discovering that my brand new clarisonic had to be charged. I was already somewhat baffled that my new supposed to be \\&quot;fantastic\\&quot; brush was only half way charged. Thinking nothing about it, I plug it in to charge. Not knowing how long it would be, I kept going on my daily routine. When it is in charging mode it blinks on and off when it is finally fully charged it turns solid. A couple hours later I returned to see if it was fully charged, I noticed it was still blinking. I didn&#x27;t realize how long the clarisonic brush took to charge until a few days later when was finally fully charged. I started using the clarisonic brush and it felt great against my skin. I could definitely say my face felt cleaner compared to when I simply just washed my face with my bare hands. Hearing so much about how great this brush was, I was expecting more. They said things like it could get rid of wrinkles, fine lines, zits, and so on. Ive had it a total of five months now and I still get zits. It also did not minimize my pores the way it said it would. Disappointed by the results, I am still using the brush hoping to see a change in the results. With my experience to back it up, I personally really don&#x27;t think it works as great as people say it does. It wasn&#x27;t a total waste of money, I&#x27;ll give it the benefit of the doubt. I just wish I could see the results they were ragingabout sooner. So learn from my mistakes folks before you get caught up in all the great reviews of the clarisonic brush decide for yourself, do I really want to spend all that money on this right now? For something that results don&#x27;t even show up right away. Or should I spend it on something more useful. As a consumer of this product I would give it two stars and a half.&lt;br /&gt;  With 200 and something dollars, I believe you could invest in a way better skin care system, get a new phone, or simply save it. I personally only charge it when I really want to use it. I find the more I use it I actually get zits and my pores open up more. The warranty offers you a 90 day trial better make sure you get your dollars back in those 90 days. Most likely you will not end up getting your dollars back though because of how long it takes for it to charge. After two to three uses, clarisonic will take forever to recharge and its only 20 seconds and 10 seconds twice. 10 seconds on your checks and 20 seconds on your nose and chin. It also states it will remove all the dirt and oil off your face. I was even more emotionally bruised. I took it personal thinking my face had extra dirt and oil. They give you this false image of how beautiful you&#x27;ll look when you use it. They also make it seem like you&#x27;ll have tons of friends and be super popular because of your new perfect skin. When in reality your pores stick out more, you still get zits, and your self-esteem remains the same. Everyone wants to look like that pretty faced girl on the box overnight. In reality it&#x27;s not going to happen. Five months from now your skin will still be looking like how it was before except 200 dollars less in your pocket. I believe the pictures were two totally different people or either photoshoped because like I said I definitely did not receive the same results other people did. With this being said think twice before you pull out your credit card.</li>
    <li> I cannot believe the difference in my skin after using the Mia for 1 1/2 months. This winter I experienced extremely dry skin that could not be helped no matter how much moisturizer I used. I experienced occasional blackheads and unsightly pores. My major problem with most cleansers is that I have a mild case of rosacea that does not necessitate special treatment but can result in irritation with strong cleansers.    My routine is as follows. Every morning, I use Clinique dramatically different moisturizer followed by my Smashbox makeup. In the evening, I remove my eye makeup using neutrogena eye makeup remover.Then I use my Mia with Neutrogena gentle cleanser. I use the delicate brush for my MIa because the sensitive one that it came with was just a little too much for me. After washing my face, I pat it with a towel so that it is just slightly damp and apply my Clinique moisturizer in a heavy coat.    To say that my skin has improved is a gross understatement. My hair stylist actually commented on how great my skin looks. This is a huge compliment from someone who is up close and personal with faces all day long. My pores are practically invisible, and I have absolutely no acne. The problem with flaky skin has disappeared, and my skin looks younger than it has in years.    The only wish I have for my Mia is that it would have a timer to indicate when to move from one part of the face to another. My sister&#x27;s Plus has that, and she loves it.</li>
    <li> I have had the same skin care routine my entire life because I have the world&#x27;s most sensitive skin. I&#x27;m allergic to balsam of peru which is found in a lot of &amp;#34;hypo&amp;#34; products and fancy products alike. My routine since childhood has been Dove soap, and nothing but Clinique for foundation and blushers. A few years ago I started adding USANA Sense products (after going thru the Murad, Dermalogica rounds). The USANA products (perfecting essence and serum intensive) did wonders to diminish laugh lines and eye wrinkles. All in all I thought my skin was in pretty good shape for being incredibly fair and prone to blemishes and rashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hubby gave me this for Christmas and at first I tilted my head, like &amp;#34;why did you spend money on something I&#x27;ll use once and toss in the bath tote of lost electronics?&amp;#34; But he said the older lady at the Macy&#x27;s &amp;#34;with great skin&amp;#34; swore by it and said I would love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it once and was jumping up and down. The pesky little fine lines were gone. My pores were tiny and when I applied makeup it look like my face had been photoshopped to perfection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it in the shower in the morning with simply Dove soap and it&#x27;s like a facial. I&#x27;m completely elated with this product and my skin is as soft as my 2 year old&#x27;s bum. I highly recommend this to any woman, it&#x27;s a home-spa treat!</li>
    <li> It feels great after each use. It leaves smooth and softer faces.&lt;br /&gt;I brought another one for my daughter to use.</li>
    <li> This product is really amazing.  I went out of town and forgot to take it and in two days my skin was not as smooth as when I was using.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> this is a great product that makes my skin feel so great and smooth and clean i use it twice a day.</li>
    <li> I have been wanting a Clarisonic for years but couldn&#x27;t justify the price. I&#x27;m an endurance swimmer and I have to put tons of sunblock on my face to keep myself from getting hyperpigmentation/age spots/wrinkles/cancer, so when I get out of the pool I really like to have something that gets all the sunblock and chemicals off my skin and out of my pores. I&#x27;m the kind of person that likes squeaky clean skin on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Olay introduced their own \\&quot;version\\&quot; of the skin brush system, I eagerly jumped on board. I have been using the Olay brush daily for a few years now, and I definitely noticed an improvement in my skin. But I always wondered if the Clarisonic was better, and this year, I finally got one for Christmas (thanks, Mom!) ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;... and the Clarisonic is better. MUCH better. The major difference is that the Clarisonic doesn&#x27;t spin- it vibrates. When I first turned on the Clarisonic, I was actually put off by this. Surely it couldn&#x27;t do as good of a job cleaning my skin as a brush that spun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after using the Clarisonic, I *get* it. It&#x27;s a completely different clean. It&#x27;s still very vigorous, but instead of just sort of going *over* the skin like the Olay brush, I could feel it getting *into* my pores. And it really feels wonderful- it&#x27;s like a massage. It&#x27;s just a whole different experience. It&#x27;s relaxing and soothing as well as cleansing. You can feel the blood rushing to your skin in response to the Clarisonic. The key is to let it dance over your face- if you push it into your skin, like I was tempted to do, it won&#x27;t clean as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is also much larger, which makes it easier to cover your entire face and neck in a smaller amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got out of the shower, my skin was glowing. I put my regular skin cream on and I could literally feel it going *into* my skin as opposed to just sliding it over my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not one to go on and on about skin care or products related to skin care, but... WOW. I&#x27;m totally a convert. I went ahead and ordered a few different brushes (mine came with the sensitive brush and I wanted to test out the deep pore cleaning brush, as well) I feel like this is more of a treatment or an experience than just another product you use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as ease of use- the Clarisonic is a VERY simple setup. It comes with a simple magnetic charger that will charge the brush for 15-20 uses, so if you are using the Clarisonic once a day, you&#x27;ll only have to charge the brush twice a month. When you first get the Clarisonic, you charge it for 24 hours. The charger is simple- it&#x27;s a magnetic clip that attaches to the bottom of the brush. The brush handle sort of \\&quot;pulls\\&quot; it into place.  No bricks or weird cables or anything. It literally just sticks, magnetically, to the bottom of the brush in the right spot. After the first full charge, you unclip the charger and bring the brush into the shower with you (or wherever you do you your cleansing routine)- the brush is fully waterproof and is charged for about 15-20 uses. You don&#x27;t have to keep charging this brush every time you use it. When the battery starts to lose charge, you bring it back out to the charger and clip it on and let it charge again. No batteries to change, like the Olay. Just keep the charger out of moisture and you&#x27;re set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are supposed to last for about three months if kept clean (rinse well after using). They are a MUCH higher quality than the Olay brushes. Just make sure you get them from Clarisonic, because there are a lot of knock offs on the market in Clarisonic packaging, and I&#x27;ve come to learn that they are NOT the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty excited about it, if you can&#x27;t tell. It feels like such an indulgence. I&#x27;m completely bummed that I didn&#x27;t get one before now, but I&#x27;m so happy that I finally have one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are considering an upgrade from a drugstore system or just considering purchasing a Clarisonic as a startersystem, go for it! If you know you&#x27;ll use the brush, it&#x27;s a good investment. It really does make a difference, and it feels wonderful on your skin.system, go for it! If you know you&#x27;ll use the brush, it&#x27;s a good investment. It really does make a difference, and it feels wonderful on your skin.</li>
    <li> Unbelievable and amazing difference in my skin after only one use. I immediately bought three more for friends. Skin feels like velvet and complexion glows!  And I saved thirty dollars on each Clarisonic by ordering through Amazon.</li>
    <li> I always wanted the Clarisonic but it was over 200 and I jus couldnt afford it. A freind told me about the Mia and let me tell you it works just a s great as the 200 dollar clarisonic. It does wonders for my face and my childrens face.</li>
    <li> i didnt see what all the hype was on these expensive this until i got one, i use it every night and i cant get enough. my face has cleared up and my skin is super soft and it feels great</li>
    <li> Simply amazing one of THE BEST beauty products I have ever bought!  My skin is absolutely glowing after using this for only two weeks!!!  It will never leave my side!!</li>
    <li> I always heard good things about this face device but it really blew my expectations out of the water. My skin looks great only after a week, feels amazing and is very simple!!</li>
    <li> works beautifully. Great price</li>
    <li> I have my MIA in yellow but that&#x27;s ok, I would&#x27;ve gone with white too. :p&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said the Clarisonic is the best thing to happen to my skin. I&#x27;m not acne prone to begin with but my skin is prone to being oily and lots of visible pores. Before buying the Clarisonic I stuck with cheap alternatives (that rotate more than actually deep clean) or I exfoliated with a manual brush or certain creams/washes, etc. With those methods I felt like I wasn&#x27;t getting the skin I desired and the clean feeling I wanted. After hearing about the hype I figured I should get the Clarisonic and I am so glad I did! Every time I use it I feel so clean! My skin glows too! I use once it every day with Philosophy purity cleanser in the shower, I feel like it&#x27;s not taking a toll on my skin at all. In addition if I am wearing lots of makeup or any facial makeup that day I will use it before I go to bed and go on with my moisturiser/toner/serum routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone compliments my skin and how radiant it looks. I barely even have to wear foundation because of it! I really adore my clarisonic and I have no problem going off to buy another one should it break. I like that it&#x27;s rechargeable, too.</li>
    <li> Died after only one year. It no longer charges and apparently this is an issue everyone complains about. Ridiculous especially since its not exactly cheap for what it is.</li>
    <li> Ordered this even though the cost was high.  Love it.  Bought another for my daughter for graduation.  My skin never looked better.</li>
    <li> I use this daily and love it! Gentle, thorough cleaning. Seems way overpriced for what it is, though.</li>
    <li> The unit that was shipped to me was defective. The LED wouldn&#x27;t go on when it was charging but it did charge up so I thought I would try and use it. It did work, but then when I went to recharge it the LED light came on, but intermittently, then the whole unit went dead. Worse, the company that sent it to me--Office Local--was closed down for over two weeks for &amp;#34;religious holidays.&amp;#34; The two weeks is now past, and I&#x27;ve yet to hear from them about how to get my money back or get another unit that works.</li>
    <li> I never had too many problems with my skin until I started tampering with it. First with Proactive (NEVER AGAIN) and then with the Clairsonic. My face swelled with new blemishes everywhere and it took a lot of time an patience to calm it down. It was not until I saw a dermatologist who prescribed a topical treatment that my face healed. The worst part about it was that these were not merely whiteheads but large angry cysts. However, it works quite well on thick skin (like on your back). But my face had a very hard time adjusting back to facial cleanser and water. Now I deal with lightening serums to fade to dark spots.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 37 male with poor skin, I checked online all over, and this was the best price. The company shipped it in a new box and I use it everyday. the battery is great, I charge it once every couple of months. Best purchase yet</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for four months, every day except when it needs charging.  I honestly do not see a difference in my 61-year old skin and feel a little foolish for having been talked into this.  The charging is ridiculous.  It takes nearly 24 hours to charge and lasts a couple of weeks (using once a day) on one charge.  I would recommend buying a gentle facial brush and gently massaging your face daily rather than spending the money for this.</li>
    <li> This product has been my saving grace. I was *hugely* struggling with keeping my face clear, and now I know why. After I get home I was my face with Cetophil -- as normal -- and then I use the Clarisonic with Cetophil for my second face wash. When I&#x27;m done, the Clarisonic is covered in foundation that wasn&#x27;t coming off previously. No wonder my face was so unhappy!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product and it only worked for a few months.  When I called Clarisonic, who has a 12 month warranty, I was told that this product was fraudulent and not made by them so that they would not cover the warranty.  It looks just like the real Clarisonic and is even printed with the logo and had the pamphlet and warranty info.  Luckily Amazon refunded my order, but do not order from this vendor as they are a FRAUD.</li>
    <li> Product seemed OK, my daughter, whom I bought it for used it for about 50 days, then it wouldn&#x27;t take a charge. Amazon won&#x27;t do anything about it, says it is between us and the manufacturer. If you decide to spend the money on this, buy it someplace that will help you if you have a problem.</li>
    <li> I have been using my Clarisonic from March-July.  I loved it until it wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge any longer.  When I tried to charge it,  it would buzz.  After calling Clarisonic Customer Service, I was informed this is not manufactured or supported by Clarisonic.  Amazon is not a supported vendor.  I do not recommend this!</li>
    <li> I am totally happy with purchase of clarisonic mia sonic sking cleansing system. I will be using it every day.</li>
    <li> We read tons of reviews, most of which were positive, so my husband got this for my birthday. We both use it every night, and we like it very much! It leaves your skin feeling very clean and smooth! Works with any face wash you have (I use my Neutrogena Complete Acne Therapy System, and together these two work wonders!)&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> My face is so much cleaner after using this with my usual facial scrubs.  I don&#x27;t even use it daily like I should!</li>
    <li> Easy to use in the shower and by the sink. Charger is super easy and the waterproof device makes clean up easy and use easy.</li>
    <li> My aesthetician first recommend this product.  I was having a problem with  acne--the name of which I&#x27;m not quite sure-- perhaps cystic? It is the type that appears deep under the skin &amp;  forms Large unattractive bumps on the surface Of the skin which take forever to get rid of bc the blockage doesn&#x27;t seem to come to the surface of the skin.  I started getting this type acne every month around the time of my period. This has been going on for a few years. I bought the clarisonic four months ago and this problem has almost completely disappeared. I use the clarisonic in the morning &amp; in the evening. It seemed to take approximately a month to get my skin clean enough, I guess, until the deep acne stopped appearin But right away I did notice that I stopped getting lots of little breakouts.</li>
    <li> Since using this my skin looks more alive than ever.  Its claims are justified - removing dead cells and making your face look fresh.  You get what you pay for and this is more expensive than most but remember the revolutions per minute that this offers is the best in the business.  Slower revolutions will not offer you the same results.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Product is good, got to me quickly!  Used it and works and seems very good!  Makes your face look bright and heels good.</li>
    <li> this s*** broke me out like crazy.... never using it again. I heard good reviews but damn i look like s*** now</li>
    <li> I love my Clarisonic Mia cleansing system.  My skin feels soft and provides a natural glow which works for me cause I am not a foundation person.  I use a moisturizer with sunscreen.  Don&#x27;t mind that after a minute it shuts off, if I feel I need more cleansing just push the button to restart.  Love the charger.  Easy to use..great product!</li>
    <li> Be forewarned...buying this on Amazon this product is not covered under the standard Clarisonic warranty. Being an avid Amazon customer I usually am very trusting of Amazon reviews, seller ratings, etc, however I&#x27;m really disappointed with this. I just tried to charge my Clarisonic, but instead of charging it just started pulsing and won&#x27;t hold a charge. I contacted Clarisonic directly, who told me to contact the seller, who then told me that the product was past the possible return-date, so there&#x27;s nothing they can do about it; very disappointed in their service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend getting this directly from Clarisonic instead of through Amazon (I originally bought through Amazon for the free shipping--but because of this experience I would not do that again). Also, since the product stopped working properly on me, I may consider getting a different product all together next time--someone recently suggested Foreo&#x27;s Luna to me, so I might go that route instead, even though I was happy with the Clarisonic and the Luna is a bit more pricey.</li>
    <li> Mrs. Boyer here.  Ordered this product based on a friend&#x27;s recommendation and am really glad I did.  I was looking for an alternative to harsh abrasive facial scrubs, and the soft bristles of the Clarisonic give me the same clean feeling without the scratchy effect.  I use in combination with the glycolic acid face wash from my dermatologist and the combination leaves me with clean, glowing skin.  The charge seems to last a good long while and I haven&#x27;t had any issues storing or maintaining it.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> It makes my skin feel wonderfully clean, but the thing I really like is that it is so relaxing.  At the end of a stressful day, it&#x27;s like a mini-massage for my face.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I did not see other customer&#x27;s feedback prior to purchase, only now when my &amp;#34;Clarisonic&amp;#34; stopped working, did I see the other claims of counterfeit product. I advise purchase elsewhere for real Clarisonic product which will come with warranty from Clarisonic in case of issues instead of this shoddy product.</li>
    <li> Really does make my pores look smaller and skin seem smoother- which I noticed the very next day after using it. It also reduced my acne somewhat,  but it didn&#x27;t make my skin perfect. Which I kind of expected for a $100 high-tech item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really, the most effective thing I&#x27;ve used on my skin (besides antibiotics or accutane) is anything with sulfur in it- either a prescription face wash (like &amp;#34;praxcion) or a mask (like pro-activ&#x27;s &amp;#34;refining mask&amp;#34;). Better than anything at walmart, better than topical creams from the dermatology, better than benzoyl peroxide, and better than clarisonic.</li>
    <li> Love my Clarisonic Mia. So worth the money. I bring this everywhere I travel, and have noticed a HUGE change in my hyper-pigmentation, it&#x27;s gone. My skin feels so clean after using this. I use my own facial cleanser and it works so well at detoxing the skin of daily oils and sunscreen. Great life-long buy.</li>
    <li> I was resistant to researching into this thing because I was on skeptical-clutter-gadget-alert, but after repeatedly seeing it in my dermatologist&#x27;s office and eventually even some competing version of it at Costco I finally got to reading the reviews.  Thanks to those of you who wrote reviews I finally clicked, I scored.  Simply put, it gives my skin a new and better quality that glycolic and the acid gang have not managed, and it does this without damage.  Wish I&#x27;d bothered to consider it long ago.  I imagine I&#x27;ll drag it on every trip I take given the smooth magic it creates.  The magnetic attachment to restore the battery charge is nifty.  Bravo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things to consider.  1) I got the smaller one because I didn&#x27;t want to spend the bucks on the larger one in case I found it to be a silly unnecessary gadget o&#x27; clutter, but awwwww, now I want the big one for the whole body. Could be better than a Korean salt scrub.  2) I&#x27;ve only had it for about a month.</li>
    <li> I have owned a Clarisonic Mia for a year and it works perfectly; therefore, I ordered another for a relative. Upon opening the box for the initial charge, it vibrated continuously and wouldn&#x27;t charge. I knew it must be a lemon and immediately requested a replacement. Three weeks later I just received an email telling me to contact another seller - what?!? Why should I do that? I used the replacement/return system in place by Amazon (which I normally love) and the seller contacted me. Now what??? Planning to return product to Amazon and buy at a local store.</li>
    <li> This product is easy to use and feels great when you&#x27;re applying it. The only problem for me has been that the cleansing gel gave me a rash and I had to switch to hypoallergenic facial soap.</li>
    <li> I use my Mia on a weekly basis--makes my skin feel great. Not a huge fan of the cleanser that come with it, but you can use any cleanser you want to on it.</li>
    <li> My facial tone and complexion has greatly improved since I began&lt;br /&gt;using the clarisonic twice a day. It&#x27;s water tight so you can take it in the shower&lt;br /&gt;with you. I bought one for both of my daughters, they love it. It truly is worth every penny,&lt;br /&gt;my face creams work better since the clarisonic gently brushes away dead skin and improves&lt;br /&gt;circulation.</li>
    <li> I had great skin as an adolescent and then got adult onset acne in my mid-20s. I have tried just about every brand of skin care from proactiv to dermalogica to dr hauschka, etc., but none have really solved the problem. After getting a facial that used the clarisonic, I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft and clean my skin was, so I decided to spend the money and get one to use at home. I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with my purchase. Within the first week my skin was clearer and smoother. After using the clarisonic I realized that my skin was not really getting cleansed before using my hands, special washcloths, and all the other things I tried. My skins looks fresh and glows after using the clarisonic, and their claim that products will be absorbed better has been true for me. I wish I had known about this a long time ago! I would highly recommend this product. It is easy to use, can go in the shower, and produces great results! I&#x27;m also glad I got the travel size, I wouldn&#x27;t want anything bigger.</li>
    <li> Summary:     My skin problems probably aren&#x27;t going to be resolved by anything short of prescription medication, so all I expected from the Mia was thorough cleaning and maybe some help with blackheads.  The Mia&#x27;s more than met those expectations.  I&#x27;ll be replacing it if/when it stops working and I definitely recommend it if you have the money - but don&#x27;t expect miracles for severe acne.    Details:    I&#x27;m Asian (Filipino/Chinese) with a medium-olive skin tone.  I consider my skin to be fairly strong - toners and AHA products tingle slightly but don&#x27;t hurt, and I don&#x27;t have any fine lines or wrinkles at age 38.  My skin&#x27;s very oily and there&#x27;s a lot of hyperpigmentation.  I have severe adult-onset acne due to hormone imbalance - milia on my chin, blackheads on my nose, cystic acne frequently on my cheeks and jawline and infrequently on my forehead (gets worse based on my monthly cycle), and infrequent whiteheads anywhere.      My current skin care regimen is Murad at night and a mild bead-type exfoliator during my morning shower, but I&#x27;m not very good at sticking to it - usually I use the Mia in the shower and just remove my makeup at night.      I&#x27;ve been using the Mia since mid-July more or less once a day, every time I wash my face.  Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve noticed:    - My skin is still oily - in fact, it almost seems like it&#x27;s *more* oily because the pores are clearer.  Not an issue for me since I discovered Urban Decay&#x27;s Deslick in a Tube (highly recommended if you have very oily skin!)    - My pores are much less apparent, especially when I&#x27;m wearing makeup.  Without makeup they still look pretty big to me, but I&#x27;m in the habit of studying my face in the mirror from two inches away.  I&#x27;m comfortable that they&#x27;re clear and not visible to others, especially if I blot or otherwise manage the oil.    - No or slight effect on hyperpigmentation - some darkening has faded, but it tends to fade for me over a few months anyway.    - No effect on the cystic acne.    - No effect on whitehead frequency or severity.    - The milia, which had persisted for months regardless of treatments, creams, and scrubs, are much reduced, both in appearance and amount.  I can still see some bumps, but they&#x27;re not white, and my chin is smoother.  I don&#x27;t feel like a casual observer would notice anything.  This was unexpected and AWESOME - all of my reading about milia led me to believe that they couldn&#x27;t be removed by anything short of a visit to a professional, so I&#x27;d pretty much resigned myself to just dealing with it for a while.    - The blackheads are gone.  In the past I had cleared and prevented blackheads with a weekly Biore strip, an overnight mask applied to my nose every other night (every night was too drying), and scrubbing with an exfoliator in the morning.  Using the Mia has pretty much eliminated the blackhead issue entirely.     I like the Mia a lot - my skin feels cleaner and smoother in the areas I&#x27;m not prone to blemishes.  It feels sturdy &amp; comfortable to use.  Like other reviewers, I&#x27;d be happier if it paused every ten or twenty seconds to help with timing the cleaning.  That feature&#x27;s available with the larger Clarisonic, but frankly I don&#x27;t really want anything larger than the Mia.  I&#x27;ve had no problems with recharging the Mia only weekly.    If you decide to purchase, I&#x27;d recommend picking up some makeup remover wipes as well; it&#x27;s alarming how dirty the brush looks when it&#x27;s covered with foundation, and I got paranoid that all the makeup on the brush wasn&#x27;t letting the Mia get my face really clean and ended up washing my face a second time.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading all the rave reviews and have been using it for over 2 months. I do not see a huge improvement in my skin, nor do I see smaller pores and other claims it makes. My skin is pretty good to begin with, but I don&#x27;t feel this item really makes much of a difference to keeping it smooth and clean. I might as well just return it and use a washcloth. I&#x27;d love to say I felt differently - I had really high hopes for this product!</li>
    <li> The brush makes my skin feel good, and perhaps as time goes by I&#x27;ll notice a difference in how my skin looks, but as yet there has been no noticeable difference.  I still like the brush because it is invigorating, and I feel that it must be doing something good for me.  I&#x27;ll keep using it!</li>
    <li> I bought this Clarisonic less than a year ago and it broke.  I went to register it on the clarisonic website because they have a warranty and it is an invalid number.  DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY PURCHASING FROM AMAZON. You may save a few bucks but its not worth it for the poor quality you get.  Only by from authorized retailers on clarisonic&#x27;s site. AMAZON ETC are not authorized.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product. I have been contemplating for a couples years about getting a product such as this and I am so glad I finally did. My skin is very clean and smooth after using. I noticed that after using it a couple times I developed some pimples. According to the skin care specialist at Macy&#x27;s, this is because the Clairisonic cleans your pores by bringing everything to the surface. After using it for a week my pimples were gone and haven&#x27;t returned. So in case you develop pimples, don&#x27;t be too quick to blame the Clarisonic for clogging your pores, it does the exact opposite. After cleaning my face I use the Origin&#x27;s antiaging toner, serum and day time facial cream with spf24. The best time to use the Clairsonic is in the evening before bedtime when your pores are clogged by skin cells, sweat, and whatever else that gets clogged into your pores throughout the day. I am going to purchase another for my boyfriend but plan on getting the larger one which cleans your body as well with the larger brush head. Make sure to replace your brush heads every 3 months. I hope this is helpful.</li>
    <li> I had this product die within 3 weeks of purchase, I called the manufacturer to confirm that this was a fake product---DO NOT BUY FROM KOK&#x27;S beauty store.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone who would like their skin to be clean and look brighter.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item in May and by July it had stopped working. It buzzes and hums but the head doesn&#x27;t spin around. Upon closer inspection I discovered that the painted brand logo on the item has smeared paint, certainly not something that Clarisonic would have let out of the factory. I went to Ulta and purchased a new one and discovered that the logo paint on the real one is different than this one. I have to conclude that this is a knockoff and it&#x27;s very poor quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS ITEM BROKE SOON AFTER PURCHASE. IT SEEMS TO BE A KNOCKOFF. DO NOT BUY IT!!</li>
    <li> I have always had breakouts....when I was a teen, thought, &#x27;this will stop when I&#x27;m not a teenager&#x27;....in my 20&#x27;s I thought &#x27;this will stop in my 30&#x27;s&#x27;...then I thought, &#x27;this will stop when I hit menopause&#x27;.  WRONG!  I&#x27;ve been on Accutane, Retin A, Doxycycline....you name it, I&#x27;ve tried it.  At 60, I continued to get whiteheads;  the sebum just doesn&#x27;t seem to drain properly from my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT, this gizmo has helped!  Apparently, getting my skin REALLY clean a couple times a day and exfoliating like this helps!  Far fewer white heads!  Yay!</li>
    <li> Have been wanting a Clarisonic for ages + my expectations were high. It&#x27;s truly an amazing product.&lt;br /&gt;After about a month of use, I can see + feel the difference in my skin. It looks  smoother, pores appear&lt;br /&gt;smaller + even my friends can see the improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another plus: Because your skin feels so clean, it seems that serums + moisturizers absorb better, which allows them to do a better job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend Clarisonic.</li>
    <li> This must have product is a necessity for all, not just women.  It helps your face get rid of old skin and dirt.  It allows it to rejuvenate and new skin to replace old.  It allows the full impact of moisturizing creams on your face, which I firmly believe helps diminish aging of your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keri, RN</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my sister in law.  It has stopped charging, so she called the manufacturer.  They asked for the number off the device and told her it was a KNOCK OFF.  THEY ARE SELLING A DEVICE THAT IS NOT MANUFACTURED BY CLARISONIC.  This is so deceptive, and I can&#x27;t believe Amazon would allow them to continue selling on their site.</li>
    <li> So far the best brush I ever use. My skin is so soft after every use?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had use it before</li>
    <li> Buyer beware - This product stops working after a year. I called the manufacturer and they told me since it has an internal battery it doesn&#x27;t last much longer than the warranty period. They won&#x27;t replace the product or offer you any discounts to buy a replacement. I enjoyed this product, but it&#x27;s too much money to spend on something that breaks after a year.</li>
    <li> I have owned a clarisonic for a number of years and my granddaughter, who is now wanting to care for her skin, wanted one.  She was very pleased with the gift.</li>
    <li> Your skin will feel so fresh and smooth after just one use.  Really.  I don&#x27;t use every day but a couple of times a week now.  Keeps my skin looking moist &amp; feeling soft.  I bought the delicate brush.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t buy this product. It worked fine for a few months and then the battery died and I can&#x27;t recharge it anymore. Customer service at clarisonic neglect to replace it because I bought it on amazon and not directly from them.</li>
    <li> I like the Clarisonic Mia Sonic Skin Cleansing System because it is pretty good quality.  I like how it operates and firms your skin after using the brush.  Your skin feels smoother and firmer. I have tried other brushes, but I would recommend Clarisonic over many of the other brushes I have tried and I have tried 2-3 others.  I would order another one.</li>
    <li> This is a great tool. It really cleans the face deeply and gets your skin ready to receive products. Good price on Amazon</li>
    <li> Unlike many of the other reviewers here, I received the correct, described product by Clarisonic. I first received it several months ago- close to a year ago, even. I was moving, so I didn&#x27;t charge it right away. Finally I started getting my bathroom organized, so I plugged it in. I let it charge for over 24 hours, per the instruction manual (which I read thoroughly). It didn&#x27;t turn on, but the plug was warm, so I knew the socket worked. So I tried a different socket, just in case. I let it sit and charge for another 24 hours. Still, not even a pulse. No light signal. Nothing. Thank goodness it was still under warranty (I had really let it sit until the last minute), so I returned it and ordered another one. The next one came a few weeks later. I was irritated at the length of time it took to replace it, but was anxious to give it another go. Nope. Still won&#x27;t work. I followed all of the instructions accurately, and still nothing. Waiting to be reimbursed.</li>
    <li> This product is easy to use, easy to charge and easy to clean.  I use it approximately 3 times a week and it keeps my skin feeling smooth and soft.  I don&#x27;t know if it reduces pore size, since my pores are small anyway, and no product can remove wrinkles, but it does help your face to look brighter.</li>
    <li> I just received this  a few days ago and i was excited that I could use it right away. ! I really like that the battery is rechargeable although I haven&#x27;t needed to do that yet. I know it&#x27;s only been a few days  I love how it makes my skin feel. My skin felt softer and smoother from the first use.  I haven&#x27;t tried the cleanser that it came with, I&#x27;m just using the one that I already have. It works great with it!</li>
    <li> This product help keep my skin clean. I have seen a tremendous improvement. But it does not work anymore. Can. Ot get it to charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PleAse help me.</li>
    <li> I purchase this item in June and it has already stopped working. I contacted Clarisonic and they told me it was not replaceable under their 1 year warranty because it is not one of their items. Apparently it is a rip off the product. I have tried to contact the seller and they have not responded. I am very disappointed and saddened that I have been ripped off by thinking I was buying an actual clarisonic but come to find out it is a fake. Now I am seeing more people who have purchased fromthis vendor who&#x27;s items have stopped working as well.</li>
    <li> My Clarisonic stopped working less than a year after i bought it. When I contacted Clarisonic to get a replacement, they informed me that because of the serial number my unit was not ellegible for a warranty. I tried to contact Livewater several times, unsuccesfully, no replies. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> It seems expensive, and it is, but if you care about your face then there is nothing better you can buy. It holds a charge forever, is extremely durable, and dramatically helps your complexion.</li>
    <li> I called Clarisonic customer support because I was having problems with it. They informed me that the lot number is invalid, and it is not a Clarisonic product.</li>
    <li> Plus it makes your skin feel super smooth! I am not sure how I went so long without this device. Love it.</li>
    <li> excellent, product I have much fewer ingrown hairs now and smoother skin</li>
    <li> I use every high end cream and serum that comes out.  Hope springs eternal....  But this is the best investment in skincare.  It makes every product go on better.  It invigorates but is still gentle!  Love this product.</li>
    <li> I chose the Mia because of the price (Still not cheap); I will say that the brush does what it says and is okay for sensitive skin. However, I am not blown away by the product. For re-charging, there is a tiny green light that I never noticed until I re-read the directions. There is no indicator of how much charge the product has remaining. The cleanser that comes with the packaging smells good, but I am doubtful of its efficacy. So, overall 3 stars for a sonic face cleaner that is not as best engineered as it could be.</li>
    <li> I love the way my skin feels after usage of this product.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves a wonderful glow to my skin.</li>
    <li> Bought this product for my sister, and she loves it. I gave her this along with the acne cleansing replacement brush head, and as a pair it does wonders for clearing up persistent acne.</li>
    <li> This product is not authentic! Mine broke and I called Clarisonic so get a replacement. Based on the serial # they said that I got a counterfeit product. Do not buy from this seller!!! Check the reviews- I am not the only one!</li>
    <li> This is a well-designed, easy to use and effective product. I particularly like the design of water-proof charging, which makes this chargeable device 100% safe in the bathroom. The vibration of the brushes works somehow like motor toothbrush, with much softer brushes.</li>
    <li> The Clarisonic Mia was just what I needed to make sure my face is really clean after washing.  I used to use my toner after washing, and end up with makeup on the cotton ball:O(  Now there is no makeup left on my face, my skin looks better, feels softer, and all that makes me more confident in how I look each day.  It&#x27;s an investment, but who better to reap the rewards than me!</li>
    <li> Got it for my wife as a Christmas gift. She loves it. I have to say too that I absolutely noticed a difference in how her skin looked after even one use.</li>
    <li> The clarsonic works well, but is too big and a bit clunky to fit comfortably in my hand. Also, if you are going to get one, get the one that has the stand.  This one just lies on the counter-- not good when its wet.</li>
    <li> I have been using my clarisonic everyday for a month and my skin is so much clearer!  I used to have issues with dry skin, flakiness, and the occasional breakout.  With the exfoliating benefit of the clarisonic, my skin is much smoother and I no longer have issues with dry skin.  My face feels much cleaner and I have not had any breakouts since introducing it to my daily routine.  I love that it is waterproof and can be used in the shower.  The battery lasts a long time; I have only had to charge it once since pulling it out of the box.  Totally recommend it!</li>
    <li> After a few months of purchasing my own, Clarisonic has been my way of keeping my facial care in check.  This gentle brush is great for my skin cells and keeps the skin levels activated and healthy.  I even feel the vibrations in the sinuses which are great for me.  I gave this to my daughter and also daughter-in-law as a gifts. My daughter-in-law is more than 30 years younger and love, love, loves this too.  A great healthy gift!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned my Clarisonic Mia for several years now and absolutely love it.  The reason for this purchase was, after letting my daughter try it, she had to have one of her own.  Yes, there are copycat brands out there today, but the Clarisonic gives the most excellent cleansing results on the face . . . AND CAN BE SAFELY TAKEN INTO THE SHOWER AND BATHTUB.  Scrubbing necks and backs has never been so easy!  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> When I became convinced I wanted to go for the Clarisonic I decided to go BIG -- and I bought the Clarisonic Pro, because the variable speeds and the body brush appealed to me. I did love the Clarisonic and used it regularly. However, I soon grew tired of the timing feature and didn&#x27;t really see the need for a special body brush. I ended up selling it on ebay and buying this model of the Clarisonic. It does everything I need it to do and is lighter, takes up less room and is just as effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m posting this review in case others are on the fence about the different models. For me, bigger was not better and I could have saved myself some serious cash by going with the mia, which, by the way, I love!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Clarisonic Mia for almost a month with the sensitive brush head.  It is easy to use, press the button, it runs for 1 minute and then shuts off.  You can just press the button again if you want an extra minute.  I use it 1-2 times a day, the charge lasts for about a week and a half.  The charge duration is 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my face feeling very clean although I find it very hard to navigate it around my nose.  I have noticed a decrease in breakouts though not completely eliminated.  I had really hoped it would help with clogged pores in the nose and chin area but I have not seen much improvement.  Also, it seems to make my already redness prone skin slightly more red than normal.  If you wear make-up: take it off before using the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it requires much more face wash to be used then what I typically use.  I use about 2-3x as much when using the Mia, otherwise it just feels like pushing water around on your face.  You can put face wash on your face first then use the Mia or you can put it directly on the brush.  I&#x27;ve found more product is required when only putting it on the brush but if you just put product on your face you dont get a very good lather; so i do a little of both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish it came with some sort of protective case it could fit into, or at least have one offered separately.  I also wish the brush head was smaller.  I am glad I did not opt for any of the larger more expensive models, the Mia itself is certainly not tiny and the only difference is your are not able to use the body brush on the Mia and the button options get a little fancier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the product, I would recommend it if you have the extra cash but it is not a life changer.</li>
    <li> I never would have thought I would be praising a beauty item so much that I&#x27;ve been telling all my friends, my family, my kids school teachers...heck, I even bought a few for family because I believe in this thing so much!  The Clarisonic is nothing short of amazing.  With the one minute of cleaning time, my skin has gone from dry in some spots and acne prone in others to bright, clear, and smooth.  I&#x27;m simply amazed - my skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good since high school!  I ended up buying one for my sister who has highly acne prone skin.  After about a month of use, her skin is looking much clearer, and smooth in some places - something that she has been trying to achieve for years!  She has tried everything, from Retin-A, to dermatologist visits, and a bevy of products - Clarisonic was the only one who gave results like this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usage is easy - magnetic plug to charge once a week, lather up your face a little, then use the Clarisonic for a minute in the shower every night (or morning, if you choose).  The big trick - DO NOT OVERUSE!  I&#x27;ve read that some people who go overboard and use it twice a day end up with the opposite result...your skin going nuts trying to overcompensate (aka breakouts!).  I&#x27;ve been using the Clarisonic as directed and my skin looks great!  It&#x27;s always wonderful having people comment how great my skin looks!  All in all, highly HIGHLY recommended!</li>
    <li> This product is a fake and a complete waste of money.  Looks like the real thing with &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; packaging and Clarisonic 2 yr. warranty.  However, it never worked properly and died within 7 months.  I called Clarisonic&#x27;s warranty hotline and they informed me that it was a counterfeit product commonly sold through online retailers!  So, no warranty, no cleansing system!! Not what I would expect from Amazon!</li>
    <li> I bought a Mia recently (about a month ago) because I am pregnant and my skin has been out of control. I have always had oily, acne prone skin, even now into my 30&#x27;s (I&#x27;m Mediterranean), and several people had suggested getting a Clarisonic in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it for a month once a day in the morning, I can say it is definitely helpful. My pores are better, I get fewer blackheads and the ones I do get are easier to remove. So I get fewer full out pimples/whiteheads overall, though I find the brush can be a little harsh on a pimple already on the way and make it redder. I definitely still need to use other products to fully minimize acne though - toner and the occasional clay mask) but I feel like the good cleansing helps these be more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not had any problems with charging or operating it - I usually leave it charging when not in use. If it lasts at least a few years, I&#x27;d say that it was definitely worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will also throw in that I suspect that most of the efficacy is just gently scrubbing your face for a full minute - I doubt the vibrating does much! Oh well; it still helpful overall.</li>
    <li> I plugged it in for the first time and it started to operate??? It was very odd especially since the manual shut off didn&#x27;t work to turn it off. I let it charge like that for a couple of minutes to see if it would eventually shut off manually or by itself and it didn&#x27;t. Thanks Amazon for returning this waste of time purchase. Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> BUYER BEWARE. If you buy this production from an unauthorized institution (and AMAZON is unauthorized), Clarisonic will not take any responsibility for the purchaser&#x27;s dissatisfaction. The warranty will not be honored. PERIOD! This is verbatim off Clarisonic&#x27;s website. Wish I had known this before purchasing. It does not matter if the product is counterfeit or not. Mine was real. They still will not honor any defects if purchased from Amazon. Mine was working perfectly until I put it on the charger the other day and it continuously beeped and didn&#x27;t take the charge. Clarisonic would not help me as my proof of purchase was from Amazon.</li>
    <li> When I first heard about this, I kept telling myself &amp;#34;no one NEEDS an electric face washer.&amp;#34;  This is the ultimate in self-indulgence.  Man, I love it though!  It feels like a facial and is such a fast and easy way to relax.  It certainly has made a difference on my skin - both preventing break outs and dealing with those horrible really deep pimples that can be painful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the Clarisonic for a couple of months now and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;I am a lazy, easily forgetful guy - if I don&#x27;t have to go out, I&#x27;ll forget to brush my teeth until the evening - but the Clarisonic is a good incentive to keep my grooming routine on point. It&#x27;s quick, it&#x27;s less messy than actually massaging cleanser into my face, and I enjoy it enough to remember to do it everyday. It&#x27;s also a lot gentler on my skin than all the poking and prodding I used to do. When I break out now, it heals much faster, and the &amp;#34;texture&amp;#34; of my skin looks better overall. Mostly, though, I get to spend less time in front of the mirror because a machine is responsible for something I used to have to do myself.&lt;br /&gt;I had to switch cleansers (to Whole Foods&#x27; hippie version of Cetaphil), but I now have much better skin without any real effort. I don&#x27;t think the Clarisonic works miracles (I had occasional breakouts, but not acne beforehand), but it improves everything.</li>
    <li> It cleared up my skin in just a couple of uses and gets better with continued use. I highly recommend it for people with oliy skin and large pores.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter and she loves it, says it does a great job of cleaning her face plus the price was good.</li>
    <li> I love how quickly and efficiently the processes, I feel like I am seeing a fresher look to my skin. I did not give it a perfect score as I still have hope that I will see more toning and lightening of age spots</li>
    <li> The product itself is great. I had a facial and my facialist recommended this but was selling for $50 more. The only hassel was receiving it but amazons customer service was great. They called the seller and it was on my doorstep 3days later. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> My skin feels totally exfoliated and buffed after using this product.  I would highly recommend it to anyone who has acne prone/peely/flaky skin!  My makeup goes on much easier and I feel like my face is getting much cleaner when I use this product!</li>
    <li> I purchased Clarisonic Mia On December 2010. I used  once everyday since. Little by little the battery did not last as long as it used to. Now it is not charging at all. More than reading all the reviews, it is worth to try it! You will love how your skin looks and feels! I am just so disappointed about the batterry life.I have contacted the Customer service and still no one has called me back! I just wrote them an email and I hope my product can be replaced since it is still under guaranty. For Clarisonic Mia the guaranty lasts one year. Does any one have battery issues with Clarisonic?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on my skin since I started using my Clarisonic. Very happy with my purchase, highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I love having a clean face. Nothing worse than waking up with a hangover and a face that feels like last night&#x27;s party. This product swishes and swirls on your face, taking dead cells with it, but it&#x27;s really gentle. I have a tendency to get red, so sensitive am I, and this system really wipes that smile onto my face. Go for it. What are you waiting for!?</li>
    <li> Clarisonic is an awesome product and is worth every penny of your investment. It has made a tremendous difference for my skin and I would recommend it 100%.</li>
    <li> As someone who needs to wear spf 70 every day, there is not a sunscreen or cleaner that helps get your face feeling CLEAN.  This little thing does it well.....2 minutes with any mild cleanser and your face feels clean without harsh scrubbing or additional STUFF on your face. I use the sensitive brushes.</li>
    <li> after just a few days my skin showed a great improvement - smaller pores, finer eye lines, brighter tone and my neck looked less like crepe paper.  my husband said i looked about 10 years younger!  he has even started to use the Mia and his skin is looking better as well.  we both have very sensitive skin and have had no irritation problems.  i also like being able to use various cleansers with the Mia.  i do recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my wife&#x27;s birthday present. She was really satisfied and told me that it was good product!!</li>
    <li> used to having acne trouble. tried different cleansers and ways to cleansing. still doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;ever since i use cleansing brush (those inexpensive ones) it clears up all acne and  face becomes cleaner and no  more acne seen on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paid more then to get a clarisonic. It is more expensive but again as long as it works it eventually saves up money on buying more cleansing products&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use just once a night,  with my own cleansing foam. It works.</li>
    <li> I broke out the first three weeks like everyone said. I love how soft my skin is now and I see a huge difference with the black heads on my nose. The black heads are not completely gone but I am hoping in a few more weeks I will see a bigger difference.</li>
    <li> Had another major brand before and bought this when the other gave out.  This is better quality.  Holds a charge. Has even survived being dropped in the shower - though I would not want to test it again.  Best of all: I don&#x27;t feel the need for a facial as often.</li>
    <li> I received this and followed directions to fully charge. It said there would be a light indicating when fully charged and it would also pulse twice after unplugging when fully charged, neither of which happened. Could not find a light and after two days of charging, it would only pulse once. I called Clarisonic customer service from the user&#x27;s guide included in the pkg. After listening to my concerns, the service rep. was going to set me up with a warranty so I would be covered if it was defective. After reading the serial number to her at the base of the handle, she said it was a knock-off, not authentic, they don&#x27;t use numbers like that.  She said to be assured it is the real product, you need to buy directly from them. Do not buy from this supplier!!  -- shame on you.</li>
    <li> I decided to splurge and buy the Mia because I had heard great things. Mine however would never charge and was pulsing the entire time I tried to charge it (which, if you google it, is apparently a very common problem with this product). Amazon was great about my return though, so that is good.</li>
    <li> love the rotating brush. love the way it feels on skin. love the fact that its rechargeable. i did not use the lotion that came with it because i have acne prone skin and i&#x27;m already on a skin care regimen.</li>
    <li> Works great! Skin is so soft and smooth. I use my own cleanser and it works just as well as what comes with it.</li>
    <li> I am in my early 20&#x27;s and have suffered with acne for over 10 years. I have oily skin and wear make-up daily. I have tried every acne product known to man even high end brands and prescription medication. After seeing an advertisement for this product I was intrigued and after reading some reviews decided to purchase it. I&#x27;ve been using it morning and night and my skin is nearly 100% clear for this first time in 10 years. This product is life changing and I would absolutely recommended it!!</li>
    <li> Soft, Glowing skin after first use. Very pleased with this device and have already recommended it to all my friends.</li>
    <li> Exfoliation is so important for your skin health, to remove dead cells and prevent pore blockage. I try to use all natural products and a lot of scrubs contain harsh chemicals. I use the Clarisonic with my favorite all natural cleanser. When you turn it on, it stays on for one minute which makes it easy to get the right amount of exfoliation every time.</li>
    <li> Great product, helps clear skin, and definitely leaves your skin feeling clean and refreshed. I love this product and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Does a good job cleaning.</li>
    <li> Despite this being a travel item, it did not withstand 2 weeks of travel. It broke after about 1 week of use. Also the charger is awkward and the item has to be perfectly balanced to hold the charger in place as it is magnetic. I have used similar products to this before but not this brand, All stood the test of time. I cannot return this as the packaging, etc as all been thrown away :-(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Nutrasonic was a much better product.</li>
    <li> This machine is addicting! It really makes my skin clean and smooth. Can&#x27;t live without it. No regrets. Goes a long time between charging.</li>
    <li> Love this!  Wish I had got it sooner!  I just use it at night before bed to remove make-up.  Can&#x27;t believe how clean my skin feels!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been USing this for over a month and I haven&#x27;t seen any results. Instead it&#x27;s making my skin red puffy and dry. I have such sensitive skin. When I first started using it my skin would burn so now I only use every other day. I bought a gentle cleanser to use with it but I&#x27;m still not seeing results. Will give t another month I guess.</li>
    <li> Look, there are already a bunch of reviews here that will tell you everything you need to know about this.  But for my two cents... It works great and it makes washing your face a lot more fun.  I used to have a problem with dry flakiness due to the freaking cold weather (!!!) and the Mia has taken care of that.  Its pretty much a gentle exfoliation every night.  I never had a huge acne problem, just some here and there.  I still get the occasional black head here and there, but the Mia has made quite a drastic difference. I use it with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Lavender soap.  You definitely use less with the mia because the motion makes a nice lather with just the smallest amount of soap.  In the long run, it might actually save you money - a fact that hadn&#x27;t occurred to me when I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summation:  For my skin combination skin this works great and its super fun to use.  Buy with confidence and make washing your face a fun experience!</li>
    <li> This is the worst product I have ever used. I have bought this a year ago, used it for 2 months, it broke. When it was working, I actually liked it a lot. It wouldnt charge nor react when I press the button. Then they sent me a new one. I thought it was really nice of them to send me a replacement promptly. Then it broke again after 3 weeks this time. Then I got another replacement. Now I am on the fifth broken one. I called them, they wouldnt give me a refund, nor a different product that might work better. This is the worst piece of junk ever.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how completely and quickly this little pal removes makeup along with a long day&#x27;s accumulation!  The Mia is 100% fabulous. I have owned the original Sonicare for years and saw no need to spend $$$ for the Mia.  I now keep the original  in the shower and use it more than ever before on my body.  The Mia is wonderful!</li>
    <li> I have had issues with acne for several years now; I bought this product because a friend recommended it after I went through about 6 months of a really hard time with my skin.  I love it!  Previously I thought that a Clarisonic would be too irritating to acne-prone skin, but it feels wonderful and my skin has cleared up almost completely.  I look forward to using it every night and morning.  Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve already fallen in love! First let me say I have rosacea and have cystic acne and very fair skin. The products I was using were working but this just intensifies them. With cleaner skin, your skincare products absorb so much better. The Clarasonic Mia is so easy and fast to use. I don&#x27;t know why people said it makes your skin more oily, I have THE MOST OILIEST skin known to man and its so much better now. My acne marks are fading and I wake up in the morning so relieved that I don&#x27;t have 10 new breakouts. I moisturize after with DERMAdoctor&#x27;s Calm, Cool, &amp; Corrected and it is heaven for my acne/rosacea skin. Sometimes the brush irritates me if I brush too hard but this machine cleans your skin so well. My skin care products absorb deeper into my skin. You really have to try it to see what I mean. Forget the bad reviews, they made me hesitant to buy this; this machine has restored my self-confidence and it can do the same for you. After all, they do offer a 60 day money back guarantee. DO IT, NOW!!</li>
    <li> I never thought one product could affect and improve my skin so much. My dry skin has improved dramatically, and my patches of acne have cleared up. I&#x27;ve been gushing to everyone about how amazing this product is!!!</li>
    <li> My dermatologist doctor giggled about the promises, but I found the cleanse very deep,  worth it ! keep using it for almost one year in a weekly  basis.</li>
    <li> It was something my daughter requested for her birthday gift and she reports to me she loves it.  What more can you ask?</li>
    <li> I saw my mother admiring this in Ulta and decided to check online where it was much cheaper and could be purchased with other accessories.  She absolutely loved it for Mother&#x27;s Day!</li>
    <li> This has been a great lesson in making sure I read all of the negative comments before making a purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like many other posters, I purchased this thinking I was getting an authentic Clairsonic product.  However, unfortunately for me, I didn&#x27;t even bother to look into the negative reviews or the validity of my purchase until after it stopped working a few months after I got it, which was past the time that Amazon honors returns.  (The unit just completely stopped working, the charger still seemed to be charging the unit and vibrated upon connecting, but the unit was a complete brick).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a Prime Member and a frequent purchaser from Amazon, I&#x27;m shocked and disappointed that they haven&#x27;t done anything to pull this vendor off of the marketplace, or at very least honor returns for products that turn out to not be what they were advertised as.  This experience definitely has me second guessing any purchases I make from Amazon.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A FAKE!!! I was leery to order this product. So, right when I received it, I called Clarisonic to make sure it was the real deal. Sure enough, when I read the serial number (at the bottom of handle of the product) to a representative of Clarisonic, she told me that it was not a Clarisonic serial number. I gave her the name of this seller. She said she has never heard of them and that they were not an authorized seller.  I returned the unused fake product to Amazon immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  Immediately after I wrote this review, the name of the seller changed.</li>
    <li> I love how my skin feels.  The one speed is very smooth and has forced me to cleanse my face until the Mia stops.  My skin has a glow just in the few days I have used it.  Can&#x27;t give it a 5 star because I was ask to rate this and have had it only a short period of time.</li>
    <li> The product came on time and in great condition.  The box looked a little old, like it had been sitting in a warehouse for awhile, but the product itself was in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> Buyer beware.  Not a real Clarisonic.  Found out after I tried to register the product on the clarisonic website and the ID# did not work.  Called the company and they confirmed it was not a real Clarisonic.  Also, the metal prongs were covered in rust after 1 month of use.</li>
    <li> My skin is fairly sensitive; and I have eczema. (It&#x27;s also combination.) It&#x27;s not a cure all, I still have to be vigilant with the toner(witch hazel) and moisturizer (vitamin e cream). But, I find my pores look a lot smaller and my skin looks smoother and younger.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried the mini cleanser that came with it yet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my clarisonic mia sonic skin cleansing system! I use it every night before I go to bed.</li>
    <li> First of all, I don&#x27;t believe in miracle beauty products. Second of all, I rarely go to the trouble of writing product reviews. That said, this IS a miracle product and lives up to all the other favorable reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it daily or every other day in the shower with Cetaphil cleanser. My skin is baby soft, the pores look smaller, and my Rosacea is not as noticeable. I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed if you buy a Clairsonic product.</li>
    <li> Previously owned the Olay spin brush.  Enjoyed it.  But I like the Claisonic Mia even better.  Would probably spend the extra money for the timer that tells you when to change areas on your face.  My face seems to have less blemishes and is soft and smooth.  Definitely recommend this product and think it is worth the money.</li>
    <li> This is a Christmas gift, so I haven&#x27;t actually used it yet.  I am looking forward to incorporating this into my skin care routine.  It came quickly, and in great condition.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product when it&#x27;s working. I&#x27;m not sure why it stopped but it does spin and now then as if it knows the battery is charged but cannot use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not clear what i should about this. It&#x27;s taken me a while to get around to filing this because of travel but it actually stopped working in the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it was working - awesome product....</li>
    <li> I have somewhat oily skin, and needed to wash my face several times a day.  I use the Mia morning and night and my skin no longer gets oily during the day.  I really feel like it gets my makeup completely off of my face, leaving it feeling so clean, fresh, and free of dirt.  Best purchase ever!</li>
    <li> This little machine is amazing.  Makes your skin feel unbelievable soft and gives you the feeling of being very clean!</li>
    <li> My Clarisonic stopped working after 11 months - I called Clarisonic because they have 1 year warranty, and they informed me that this product is a fake based on the serial number on the bottom of the Clarisonic. They said they have had many complaints from purchases on Amazon.... do yourself a favor and buy at a store or credible retailer.</li>
    <li> Made me broke out in rashes all over. It&#x27;s like boil (pimple like) rashes that wouldn&#x27;t go away. It took me over a week to recover from it.</li>
    <li> Died after approximately 18 months.. that&#x27;s about it&#x27;s lifespan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to buy one every year and a half, then go for it, I expected it to last at least 2-3 years under normal use.</li>
    <li> I fell in love quickly with the Mia but the love wasn&#x27;t returned.  Within 2 weeks I had broken out in acne like I was a teenager. So bad was the breakout I went to get a facial.  It turns out if you have oily skin, the exfoliation stimulates the oil glands!  I was using it twice a day and it is way too much. They recommended I stop using it and sure enough the acne stopped.  The most is maybe every other day but ideally once a week.</li>
    <li> The item is very cheaply made and the inside has rust from the screws.  It seems like it should cost no more than $30.  I think it is overpriced and not worth the price.</li>
    <li> A friend told me about the Mia facial cleanser after she received one for a Christmas gift.She raved about it. I purchased one, on her recommendation, and am so glad I did. I love it. My pores are cleaner, my skin smoother, and my face glows. I&#x27;ve noticed a difference after using it every day for only one week.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the Mia for a month now, and I also bought the Clarisonic acne clarifying cleanser set (which I&#x27;ve been using instead of the cleanser that came with this system). I was using it twice a day, but cut it down to once a day, sometimes even just every other day because of it was leaving my skin dry and flaky (just like Proactiv always did- the reason for me no longer using that product). Anyways, I really can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s cleared up my skin, because it hasn&#x27;t. A friend of mine that works for Sephora used to have terrible acne and recommended this to me because it worked for her (she has great friggin&#x27; skin now by the way).&lt;br /&gt;I never used to have acne, maybe a pimple here and there growing up, and here I am at 28, with a forehead full of zits, and they&#x27;re mutating down the right side of my face and neck :(&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;m giving it a go. So far, nothing. Kinda bummed because this is a lot of money to spend on something that just isn&#x27;t going to work. Then again, it&#x27;s only been a month, and I will continue to use this for a few more months and update again then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE***&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give this product some time to work its magic. I suppose there&#x27;s some improvement, but I&#x27;ve also started showering in the morning instead of at night, so I assume that has something to do with it. Anyways, since it had been two months and I wanted better results (and it had been long enough that the brush head needed to be changed anyway), I decided to switch out the brush head for the one specifically for acne that I bought shortly after buying the mia. Sadly, when I took the brush head off, I noticed the inside of the mia head was completely covered in rust. This thing is meant to handle some water. How else am I suppose to rinse off the brush head after using it, you know? So why is something I wash my face with now rusty? Kinda gross. But I still tried out the acne brush head. Not gonna lie! But it doesn&#x27;t even spin anymore. It just vibrates. I probably oculd have spent $20 for some drug store brand that would do the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;WHAT THE HELL.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so bummed that I spent all this money for something that would just crap out on me about two months later. It&#x27;s past 30 days, so there goes my refund. I&#x27;m hoping that in contacting the company they&#x27;ll at least exchange it for a new one.&lt;br /&gt;Bummin.obably oculd have spent $20 for some drug store brand that would do the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;WHAT THE HELL.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so bummed that I spent all this money for something that would just crap out on me about two months later.

    <li> I like the machine.  First my skin became very flaky, but when the skin was fully exfoliated, after about a week, my skin feels better, more refined without the flakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems like it took forever to get to my home (over a month).  Paperwork said it was assembled in the US, but it came from China.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item and after the 2nd charge only, it stopped working.  I tried contacting the seller several times to complain but no reply.  I then filed a complaint with Clarisonic on their website and after asking me some questions to verify the device, they said that they could not authenticate the lot code printed on the unit I had purchased.  I&#x27;m very upset by this and I hope Amazon can help me.  Don&#x27;t you guys verify your sellers?????</li>
    <li> I purchased this item on 1/27/13, and less than two months later the product stopped holding a charge and will no longer work.  I called Clarisonic and they said I had been sold a fake!  Clarisonic themselves offer a 1 year warranty on the product, but (obviously) since this one was a fake they would not replace it. I purchased this through this product page on Amazon, processed through ProTronics.  The Amazon page says they will only honor refunds if sent back within a month. I am contacting ProTronics as this is false advertising.</li>
    <li> I have only been using the Clarisonic Mia for about a week and already see improvements in my skin.  I am still using my regular face products, the only change is the addition of the Clarisonic.  My teenage son is using it too and is starting to see his acne clear up!  Awesome product, great price!  I would definitely recommend this item.</li>
    <li> i had really bad acne scars, cystic acne and combination skin before i tried this and within 1-2 weeks the pimples were gone. i havent had any pimples since then and the acne scars and starting to vanish. i use it with origins checks and balances and it really works well. my skin is so soft now and clearing up after 6 years! its a little expensive but its worth it! the only downside is how long it takes to fully charge.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 76 and don&#x27;t have the best of complexions. I&#x27;ve used the Clariisonic for about a month and can hardly believe the difference. Skin is so smooth, fresh looking and the blemishes are disappearing. Will continue using.  So glad I purchased the Clarisonic Mia.</li>
    <li> I bought the Mia because I am 25 and still suffering from acne. I had a tendency to get those painful, red bumps on my cheeks that don&#x27;t have a head on them. The Mia has completely done away with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, when I get a zit now, it&#x27;s always a small whitehead that is easily dealt with. Gone are the cystic nightmares of the past! Nothing I have ever used has worked as well as the Mia. I have to be sure to change the head every two 1/2 months or I start breaking out again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people have reported that it minimizes wrinkles, but I have not noticed any such effect, and I have been using it for nine months now. It has improved the overall texture of my skin, and I know that my skin is cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s ridiculous how much better it cleans my skin than anything else. I like to use a wet wipe to take off my makeup at night. After I have completely scrubbed my face with the wipe to the point where it appears that it is not accumulating any more residue, I use my Mia. Every time I am slightly disturbed by how much makeup I see on my Mia before I rinse it. It just gets your face so clean!</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my mom, i had bought one for myself earlier, and she loves it.  Says her face feels so smooth.</li>
    <li> I purchased my Clarasonic Mia through Amazon seller ProTronics on March of this year. Everything was fine until my unit stopped functioning. I called Clarasonic to get another unit as mine seemed to be defective. I was FLOORED when the customer service representative told me that the product was COUNTERFEIT!!!!! The serial number on the bottom was not used by the Clarisonic company. I called Amazon right away to alert them of the problem- they were wonderful and refunded my money within 12 hours. My family uses Amazon for pretty much everything in our house except groceries. It&#x27;s frightening to think there are sellers like this on my &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; shopping site. AGAIN, BUYER BEWARE- PROTRONICS SELLS COUNTERFEIT PRODUCTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE IT IS NOT AUTHENTIC.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this and used it for a few months before it just stopped working entirely. I called Clarisonic and gave them the serial number on the bottom of my unit. They informed me that this was NOT an authentic Clarisonic and that it is FAKE.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon is giving me a refund, which is great. Again, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE IT IS NOT AUTHENTIC.</li>
    <li> Can you say clean skin? Really clean skin? My teen loves hers &amp; my next one will be for me. We don&#x27;t use the Clarisonic facial cleansers, just our typical with great results. A bit over priced tho. Not a casual purchase.</li>
    <li> This broke in a year and when contacted, Clarisonic verified that it is not an authentic Clarisonic. I want my money refunded immediately.</li>
    <li> I truly love the Clarisonic. My skin looks so differently than it used to, before I started using it. It has gotten rid of the skin congestion. I look younger. I also let it skim over the bottom of my under-eye circles. (just onto the bottom rim) It has gotten rid of my dark circles totally.</li>
    <li> Tried it at a drs office which is why I ordered it. Have been using it twice a day and my skin definitely feels softer. I actually look forward to cleansing my face.</li>
    <li> One of the best ways to get your skin perfectly clean. Plus, it feels like a massage while you are cleaning your face.</li>
    <li> Stop working after a year.</li>
    <li> This product leaves my skin smooth, soft, &amp; glowing. I&#x27;m a happy customer! I&#x27;m glad I purchased this product for me!</li>
    <li> I bought this product and after about two month the brush stopped working. It turns off as if it had low battery even though it shows a lit light as if fully charged when connected. The few time that I used it I really liked it and felt like it was making a difference on my skin but that didn&#x27;t last long. Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll invest on it again after that experience. I hear wonderful things about this product, but mine sadly didn&#x27;t work far too soon.</li>
    <li> I purchased Clarisonic Mia on March 30.  I think it is a great product and my skin felt great.  After 3 months, the unit stopped working and will not charge.  Thank god I had read the Amazon reviews and because Amazon is not an authorized seller, purchased it directly from the Clarisonic website for warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I called Clarisonic and they will be sending me a replacement unit.  According to the customer service rep, the unit needs to be plugged in at ALL times except while it is being used.  If you treat this like a normal electronic device that needs to be charged once the charge has depleted, the unit will eventually die.  They have a really high rate of return on the units because of this reason as most people will charge it when necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clarisonic needs to update the instructions to make this clear on such an expensive purchase.  Also I guess you cannot travel with it since it needs to always be plugged in.</li>
    <li> I love this thing. I have the MIA and the full size clarisonic. I use the MIA for travel because the charger is easier to tote and the device itself is smaller. I noticed a difference in the way my skin felt and looked almost immediately! It is important to moisturize after using this though because it really cleans off all the oil and excess face gunk. I think that this device really helps because it allows for any post products to absorb better and therefore work more efficiently. I would recommend this product to anyone! However, if you are a serious face and body product person and use this mostly at home, I would buy the full size model so that you can get the extra brush heads (for sensitive skin, body, etc).</li>
    <li> If indeed you have skin, you NEED this.  I keep mine in the shower and I can&#x27;t got even a day without washing my face with it.  I can FEEL the difference when I&#x27;ve gone without it (I have forgotten it on the occasional weekend getaway)...my face feels dirtier.  Even my husband has started to wash his face with this (and trust me, he is the furthest thing from a metrosexual man).  He loves how clean his skin feels after he&#x27;s used it and his shave is cleaner afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used the Clarisonic, the color of my skin changed.  Literally.  I looked in the mirror and thought, \\&quot;whose SKIN is this?!\\&quot;  I had never seen it look so fresh (and apparently, clean).  I plunked down my credit card right then and there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in my mid-thirties and consider tho Clarisonic face brush the front liner in my trove of age defiance and denial tools.  I can swap brands on lots of my cosmetics but NOT here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Get the body brush attachment, too!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved this product until after 5 1/2 months it just stopped working.  Purchased from Health and Beauty Online Store who would not respond to my email even though product has a 1 year warranty.  Amazon (who are always great with impeccable customer service) returned it for me, but Health and Beauty Online Store deducted a restocking fee.  Did they really have to restock a defective product.  Loved the Mia while it was working.</li>
    <li> So glad that I bought this it goes so well with my Veritas Cleanser and Pore perfecting polish!! Makes my skin feel like I just had a facial in the shower when I use these!!</li>
    <li> Really help cleaning your face better. You can use with any cleanser you want. Not too harsh for the skin.</li>
    <li> This product seemed like it had been opened and used before. The brush head was new, but I wonder if the product had been refurbished. This was not specified in the listing. I got a good price though and it works great. Because this is a personal care item, I would have paid more for new if I had known.</li>
    <li> I liked the Clarisonic BUT really for what the item cost and since I was told it was new it should have lasted, at the very least, a full year.  When I am able to purchase  another Clarisonic  or similar I will go to a department store where I have a least a year warranty.</li>
    <li> After 3 weeks of use, I believe this product is well worth the money.  My skin is clearer and softer.  The Mia retains its charge for a week when used twice daily and requires 12hrs to recharge.</li>
    <li> Very happy with my Clarisonic purchase.  It was recommended to me by a esthetician after she used it for my facial.  I feel like me skin gets really, really clean with it, much cleaner than before, removing any trace of makeup, moisturizers or the like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was feeling that the brush was a little stiff for my face and maybe a bit abrasive after using it for 2 of the 3 recommended months&#x27; of life for the brush head before replacement.  Online I found a \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; brush head that is really improving my experience with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative comment I have about the system is that the rechargers takes almost 24 hours, and the way it needs to sit to have the charger connect prevents you from seeing the green light on the other side to see when the charging is complete.  I have to keep picking the set up to see when it&#x27;s done. Sort of a weird design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~Ms. Ali</li>
    <li> Read a bunch of reviews and ordered it.  Then I received it... plugged it in and it pulses and beeps to charge,  I swear as much energy as it expends while charging no wonder it takes 24 hours to charge according to the manual.  Well.... mine didn&#x27;t keep a charge at all.. not to mention annoying sound while charging that didn&#x27;t bode well with my GF.  Then I read the manual... 10 second treatment..and then it hit me.  The real active ingredient is the cleanser not the tool.  I can apply the cleanser myself with my fingers and get the same or better results.  I returned this product for a refund and instead did some research... got some white tea cleanser and lotion... some witch hazel and three weeks later my facial razor bumps are resolving.</li>
    <li> I ordered my Clarisonic May of 2010.  It is still working properly and charging properly.  It does not make noise while charging and I don&#x27;t keep it charged all the time.  It sits in my shower until it pulses and the light goes on, and then I charge it over night.  I only need to charge it once a month at the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is so soft and silky after using.  There is a a difference of the days I don&#x27;t use it.  I have sensitive, dry, flaky skin, so this gently exfoliates and really cleanses the pores with its vibrations.  My skin is smother, softer, and brighter when I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a great investment.  Can&#x27;t do without it now.  I have the soft bristle brush for sensitive skin and its perfect for me. If you  have sensitive skin, this may be the way to go as the other brushes may be too hard.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about 4 months and then it stopped turning on. At first, I had to push the \\&quot;on\\&quot; button really hard to get it to start, and then it stopped turning on at all. The metal prongs that hold the brush started rusting almost immediately after I started using it, even though I cleaned the brush and prongs once every two weeks. I started doing some research and found that most of these products sold online are knock-offs. To test it, I tried registering the unit on the Clarisonic website and it would not accept the lot code on the handle, saying it was not a valid number. It is not worth saving $20 on this product online when you may just have to bite the bullet and spend the full $119 at an approved Clarisonic retailer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did see a huge improvement in my acne-prone skin during the 4 months of use and I will be purchasing an authentic Clarisonic from one of their approved retailers.</li>
    <li> My grandson loves all of the Thomas characters.  These are beautiful, gentle and educational stories for toddlers. He is two and knows all of these trains and other machines by name.</li>
    <li> She requested this Clarisonic skin system and seemed really happy when she opened it. I am sure that she will get lots of use out of it.</li>
    <li> I rated this a five for it&#x27;s performance. This is one of the best products I have ever used on my face.</li>
    <li> The shipping was quick and the box was brand new (unopened) and in excellent condition. I&#x27;m always a little worried about the condition of the box when I order these, but it was perfect! Keep up the good work!</li>
    <li> Great and completely worth the money. I don&#x27;t use soap on my skin and it works with-out soap fine. Highly suggest it, don&#x27;t need to buy the bigger more expensive one, the travel size is perfect.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used one of these before, but I have used scrubs to exfoliate, but at times went a little crazy and scorched my poor sensitive skin not thinking as I rubbed it on my face in the shower :(. Ships with the gentle brush head and can be used with many different products. Works like a charm.</li>
    <li> I love my sonicare toothbrush, I&#x27;m on my third one, I could not live without it.  So I thought I&#x27;d give the Clarasonic Mia a try. I have minor issues with my skin, small amount of adult acne, oily sheen. I admit I don&#x27;t spend too much time on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the Mia for a couple of months, it does leave your skin feeling clean but I didn&#x27;t notice any amazing difference or change. I believe I would have really benefitted from this when I was younger and worked in pretty dirty environments. My skin was definitely not getting clean enough back then, lots of clogged pores, but for someone in their 40&#x27;s I didn&#x27;t see much of a benefit for such an expensive purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The staff &amp; customer service at Derma Shoppe were amazing.</li>
    <li> Followed all directions re charging the Mia but after 2 days it failed to charge properly.  Loved the cleaning action so asked for return and replacement through Amazon. Got a mailing label back from Amazon BUT I HAVE PAY THE RETURN POSTAGE. Brandnameskincare obviously does not stand behind this product. I will get refund and go to a store and buy my next unit -- I would rather pay the tax and know I can bring it back if it, too, is a dud.</li>
    <li> This product works as it&#x27;s supposed to.  I was under the impression that the brush head would spin, but it just vibrates back and forth.  It leaves your skin feeling great.  I have been using it for about 2 weeks now, 2x a day.  The only suggestion I have it to use your own cleanser.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!!! I got compliments on my skin looking brighter the very next day after i used it. I can feel how much cleanier my skin feels and serums/lotions totally absorb better now.  Definitely a must have for any skin care enthusiast!</li>
    <li> I like this product--it works well.  I definitely have smoother skin with regular use--my moisturizer feels like it absorbs better.  I like the smaller size and reduced price over the bigger model.  The battery charge is reasonable.  I like the timer function.  My only complaint would be the cost of replacement brushes.  I am sure I don&#x27;t replace them at the recommended intervals because of the cost.  As a result, there is a little bit of the ice factor...  So if you purchase--just be prepared for the maintenance cost.  On other tip--I just use my regular cleaner--I don&#x27;t buy the clarsonic cleaner.  Don&#x27;t use scrubs with this--it is too much scrubbing.  I have roseacea--I use the brushes made for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I use this every night it gets my pores positively clean of makeup. When I put moisturizer on now I feel it actually gets absorbed.</li>
    <li> I only owned this 3 months and it is already broken.  I tried contacting the manufacturer who stated the serial number was not valid thus the warranty was invalid.  If you want this device, you should order directly from the manufacturer so you get the warranty.</li>
    <li> I waited until I used this product for at least 4 weeks before writing something about it and I can honestly say that my face feels clean and I think that my face products work better after cleaning my face with the Mia. I tried using some other cleansers with the Mia and found that I like the way the Clarisonic  works with the Gentle Hydro Cleanser best. I really love the product.</li>
    <li> I received it yesterday I already did my legs and thighs!! It does not hurt at all (to me at least) and the product is great! I have to say that I am bit nervous about the underarms but I&#x27;m sure it will work fine! Worth my money! And easy to clean as well.</li>
    <li> The product worked fine but it stopped working. The battery no longer accepts a charge. Amazon and the Mfg. and the vendor all point to each other. The Mfg. says they know about this problem but because I bought it from Amazon instead of an approved vendor they won&#x27;t consider any sort of rebate, etc. I was under the impression that when you buy through Amazon that Amazon stands behind the product. If you are considering this product, be aware that the Mfg. will not help you with any problems because they don&#x27;t consider Amazon to be an approved vendor.</li>
    <li> This item stopped working after 7 months.  I called Clarisonic customer service and was told this was NOT a real Clarisonic and therefore not covered by warranty.  I spoke with Amazon customer service and they will only return 1/2 of price.  They told me to contact Luna Limited if I wanted full refund or replacement. I emailed Luna Limited customer service and have received no response!!</li>
    <li> I love this product. Up till now, any type of scrubbing gels that I have used have left my skin irritated  but this product is very gentle yet does the job well. You can see the difference right after the first use; my skin looks fresh and feels soft. I have dry skin so I only use it once or twice a week with the sensitive brush, people with oily skin or acne could probably use it more.  I would definitely recommend it to both men and women.</li>
    <li> I do my Christmas shopping early and I bought this in September for my wife&#x27;s Christmas gift.  I got this through Amazon sold by Beauty Shop Depot.  December 25th she opened it and it wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge or otherwise work at all.  I contacted Amazon and they said the time for returns had run out but they would make an exception.  On January 3rd they contacted me to tell me they would only refund $80 because they were going to charge a $20.21 restocking fee.  HOW CAN YOU CHARGE A RESTOCKING FEE ON A NON-WORKING PRODUCT?  IS THIS THE ONE YOU WILL BE GETTING IN THE MAIL WHEN YOU ORDER?  HOW MANY TIMES HAS THIS JUNK BEEN SOLD AND CHARGED A \\&quot;RESTOCKING FEE\\&quot;?  It I were you, I would go to a brick and mortar store for this item and test them.  DON&#x27;T GET RIPPED OFF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I did go to my local department store beginning with an \\&quot;N\\&quot; and bought one of these, only with two speeds.  It works like a charm and she loves it.  It is the Beauty Shop Depot I am giving one star too and not the product.</li>
    <li> I like it because it makes me feel comfortable and the skin condition is improved after using that.&lt;br /&gt;It is worth to considering to buy it.</li>
    <li> The Mia makes your face feel so smooth and clean.  It gets down into the pours.  It came exactly when they said it would and it was everything we hoped for.</li>
    <li> I purchased a Mia in March and used it a couple of times a week.  I loved the way my skin felt after using it.  However, after 6 months, it just stopped working.  Of course, it&#x27;s past the return window.  I&#x27;ve read other reviews who have had the same issue.  It is an unreliable product so don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Perfect gift for my daughter. The MIA is smaller so it is easier to handle</li>
    <li> I had purchased the Clarisonic Mia in Pink a little while ago and loved it soooo much, that I had to get one for my Mom for her birthday. When I bought this one, I didn&#x27;t realize it was a &amp;#34;special edition&amp;#34; or anything, but when it came in the mail and I took out of the box, it was very nicely packaged and it came in a cute little travel bag rather than the normal Clarisonic box. Very cute, very useful, works like a charm!!</li>
    <li> This product completely lives up to all the hype!  My skin feels completely different!  Obviously doesn&#x27;t plump up any fine lines, but what I love is that I really feel my product sinking into my skin after the clarisonic removes the dead layer of skin.  Would definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had and used this device since 2 years now, and I now feel compelled to write that it has become USELESS for me almost overnight. I went to Dr Hauschka&#x27;s website, a holistic and organic skincare (an awards winning company and one of the only 6 in the world for a specific award) and one of the 7 \\&quot;rules\\&quot; that jump up at you is: \\&quot;stop scrubbing, your skin is not the bathroom floor\\&quot;!! it actually destroys the natural/protective \\&quot;acidic mantle\\&quot; of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Now the practical details: Since I started using the Clarisonic, my face kind of felt smoother at the very beginning, but my pores never got tighter! Dr Hauscka&#x27;s deep cleansing method is the classical steam bath followed by a clay mask, to purify and tighten pores. I used a clay mask last night for the first time, (have not used a clay mask since 2 years), without a steam bath nor shower before it. My skin glows like never before this morning(!!) and my pores were tighter right after and today, tighter than I have never seen them since years.&lt;br /&gt;So these microscopic images in the Clarisonic ad campaigns, even if they show the truth, it is NOT what the skin wants. I&#x27;ll never use this brush on my face again. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This cleansing brush has been a lifesaver. I have oily skin, used to breakout much more, before I used this product. It&#x27;s very gentle and easy to use- Love that it&#x27;s waterproof, so I can use it in the shower. I&#x27;ve been using it with a clinique cleanser and it works perfectly well......remember to change your brush every 3 months to ensure it stays clean.</li>
    <li> My skin has definitely improved, love this product! Any gel cleanser will work and your cleanser will last longer, you won&#x27;t need nearly as much to get the job done.</li>
    <li> The charger does not work. It just buzzes but doesn&#x27;t charge. I suppose I just received a bad one. I enjoyed it until it died.</li>
    <li> I love this product! The first few weeks your skin seems to get worse because it&#x27;s getting rid of all the bad skin and making all those little white heads come out. Don&#x27;t worry your skin will then go to a better version of your normal skin. It gets super soft. I use it every day if not every other day. I use my own face wash which is Anew from Avon since my skin can get sensitive with other products. I don&#x27;t have an acne problem but did start noticing a lot of little white heads around my nose area... they&#x27;ve been cleared. :-)</li>
    <li> Best purchase ever!  The texture of my skin has changed in just the week that I&#x27;ve used it.  Well worth the price!</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd try with the Clarisonic and once again it just aggravated my already sensitive skin. I purchased my first Clarisonic about a year ago and was thrilled to finally have something that would get deep down and do a thorough cleaning. But to my disappointment, after a week of once a day use my skin began to break out like crazy in places it never had before. I stopped using it and my skin cleared up. I gave it to my mom who used it daily for about 3 months and loved it. Then she started noticing that she was getting broken capillaries along her cheek bones and nose. So a year later I decided to try it again and bought this vibrating brush system. And once again I broke out horribly, even with the sensitive skin brush. I got 2 cystic acne on the sides of my face where I never get any kind of breakouts what so ever. I know they talk about the &#x27;purging&#x27; stage, but for me, I know this wasn&#x27;t purging. It was my skin telling me this wasn&#x27;t good. So now I use the Clarisonic to give my feet a good cleanse. It does a great job at that, but I&#x27;m keeping this thing away from my face!! Overall, I&#x27;d say that this tool does a good job cleaning, but it&#x27;s important to keep an eye on your skin. If you&#x27;re noticing changes out of the ordinary I think it would be wise to cut back your usage or stop it all together. Cystic acne and broken capillaries are not signs of improving skin!</li>
    <li> It is amazing! I just now had to charge it for the first time, and it truly lasted 20+ minutes. I really do think it has helped clear my skin too. I am so glad I got it.</li>
    <li> I WAS TOLD BY CLARISONIC THAT ITEM IS A FAKE.THEY CAN NOT WARANTY PRODUCT..I WILL BE RETURNING IT AND BUYING A REAL DIRECT FROM COMPANY..</li>
    <li> I bought this product after a recommendation from a friend. It started to not work consistently after 4 months. I did not use it daily, so it was not over use! Buyer Beware.</li>
    <li> Love it, great skin cleaner, no problems!</li>
    <li> My husband has his own cleaning head too.&lt;br /&gt;We both love this.&lt;br /&gt;Not rough on skin. Gives a great clean. Battery lasts a long time in between charges.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and use this product with Clarisonic Gentle Hydro Cleanser for Sensitive Skin.  It has dramatically improved the overall appearance of my skin.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  However, it initially made me break out, and so I asked my aestitician about this and she said at first it does because you are drudging up all the impurities and use it every other day at first.  Came quickly.</li>
    <li> After doing extensive research on the Clarisonic website and reading reviews here, I dediced to take a chance and order this brush. Right after ordering my brother&#x27;s girlfriend said she has been using a Mia since November and loves it. This is like a magic wand. I find myself running my finger over my forhead and cheeks several times a day and marvelling at how smooth they are. I also didnt&#x27;t have to charge it for a full month after receving and I used it twice a day. I believe that even if I used Dial hand soap this brush would do an amazing job. My skin is so smooth and clean feeling- I call it warm glass because it&#x27;s just so smooth! I had a few rough patches by my temples that always bothered me-GONE. Buy this Clarisonic immediately if not sooner. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Mia after an aethetician recommended it. I love that it&#x27;s cordless and can go anywhere, including the shower. I wish it can with extra brushes</li>
    <li> product works fine, like that I can take in shower and fully waterproof. Have not used the cleanser but use Kiels and is fantastic together.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this product.  It works great in the shower or before bed and makes my skin feel very clean and soft.  I don&#x27;t think it has done much for reducing lines around my eyes / forehead, but I didn&#x27;t really expect it to anyhow.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for a gift.  When it quit working the recipient contacted the mfg.  she was told that it was counterfeit and all warranties were void.  Very disappointed in Amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the Mio for about a month now. I&#x27;ve noticed my moisterizer sinks in much faster. My skin looks more radiant. I&#x27;m 51 and I feel the Mio has taken at least 5 years off my face. I would definately recommend this prodoct to my freinds.</li>
    <li> I am in my mid thirties and have always tried to do right by my skin, even with living at the beach and not being so good to my skin growing up.  I try products, expensive ones I might add, and never feel like I see the chianges they promise.  My dermatologist recommended this when I went for a facial.  I cant afford to have a facial as often ias i would like so I asked if there was something i could do differently at home.  When I first went to buy this product I couldn&#x27;t decide if I wanted the larger one.  I had a hard time deciding if I wanted to spend the money for the Mia, much less the larger one.  Well, I am so glad I went with the Mia.  I love, love, love this product and it is much bigger than I thought.  I am normally one who starts a routine then gets bored or just get busy and forget, but I use this every night and after just a couple of weeks I can tell a difference. The head on the Mia is large enough that I use it on my neck, d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute;, and chest. Definitely worth the price, which compared to most other sites is a steal.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t magically lost all my wrinkles and I won&#x27;t claim that this thing makes me look ravishing, but after a few uses, one of my \\&quot;age spots\\&quot; (I&#x27;m 33 and starting to notice some) disappeared! Yay! I really think this is a nice product. The battery lasts a LONG time which a really like. I use it every day and only charge it once every 3 weeks or so. I like the way it makes my skin feel. The price is pretty hefty though. Not sure it was worth paying $110 for it, but I don&#x27;t regret owning it.</li>
    <li> will make irritations  much more. firstly treat your acne.  more  a product stil not used. but my fight with acne still</li>
    <li> My skin has never looked better.  This was a purchase that was definitely worth every penny. It&#x27;s fast and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. My husband got it for me for Christmas and I&#x27;ve only been using it since then, so I&#x27;m not passed the initial \\&quot;purging\\&quot; skin issues. However, even after the first use my skin felt like velvet!!! I LOVE THIS THING!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Saw this in a magazine. My son is a teenager and needs to be more detailed in facial cleansing.  Neat that you can use this in the shower.</li>
    <li> Even though I lovc the product and have ordered more cleansing gel and new head, my system no long works and needs charging but there is not a charger in my package therefore, I can no longer use any of this product.  Need a charger sent to me asap.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the Mia. Cleanser goes a very long way and my skin is more bright. One tip - do not use with an abrasive cleanser from a different brand. I learned my lesson - dries out and rips up your skin!</li>
    <li> Clarisonic made a huge improvement in my skin the first time I used it, and it has only gotten better.&lt;br /&gt;Where before my skin was dull, with visible pores and minor breakouts, now it is bright, clear and even luminous. The breakouts have disappeared and a few scars I had are fading. I have switched to a cheaper, lighter moisturizer, because product absorb right into my skin now, making it more effective.&lt;br /&gt;I always saw people with incredible skin, and thought that could never be me. Well, now it is.</li>
    <li> The charger just stopped working, had to throw it away and will not buy again. Good while it worked.</li>
    <li> I have always had issues with oily skin and clogged pores (and, believe me, I am WAY past adolescence!!) The Mia has helped tremendously with these problems...and, as a bonus, my chronis sinus infections are MUCH better! The whole ultrasonic thing must jar the bad stuff loose there, too!</li>
    <li> Really gets my skin clean.  I wear makeup everyday and this really helps cleanse my face.  A true life saver.</li>
    <li> It definitely cleaned the face as my face felt smoother after using it. However, after about a week of use on a daily basis, my skin became dry, flaky and tight and I started having a pimple outbreak. I had normal-combination skin type prior to the use of the Mia, no pimples but with whiteheads on my nose. The Mia solved my whitehead issue but created another problem (dry but pimply face).</li>
    <li> Good cleaner.  Love how my skin feels after.  Charge lasts a long time.  Expensive but if it lasts it will be worth it.</li>
    <li> My product stopped working a couple of months after I bought it.  I contacted Clarisonic to report the issue and when I read the serial number they told me it is a knock off product and that Amazon is not an approved dealer.  Do not buy one of these from Amazon.  It is a fake.</li>
