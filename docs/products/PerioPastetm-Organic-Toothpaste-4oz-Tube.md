      <li>The taste is surprisingly pleasant, not like a &amp;#34;medicine&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>My biggest worry is that it would not taste good...</li>
      <li>We don&#x27;t use florida, so we&#x27;re always on the search for a good toothpaste alternative.</li>

      <li>It is amazing.</li>
      <li>The taste is unusual, but very pleasant.</li>
      <li>i like it better than the poison tooth paste they sell at the store for sure!</li>
      <li>The taste is nice -- somewhat herbal and refreshing.</li>
      <li>but I did not expect a natural toothpaste to literally be the best one I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>By and far the best &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and fluoride-free toothpaste out there.  </li>
      <li>It has a mild and pleasant flavor.  </li>
      <li>But it is really just the clean and &amp;#34; healthy&amp;#34; feeling that this toothpaste leaves in my mouth that is the best part.  </li>
      <li>Works better than Crest</li>
      <li>I love having an organic toothpaste that cleans and whitens.</li>
      <li>That would probably not be a problem for many adults.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite toothpaste, works better than anything I&#x27;ve used before in terms of whiteness, cleanliness, and breath freshening.</li>
      <li>Love the way it cleans</li>
      <li>I bought two tubes so when these run out I&#x27;ll buy more.</li>
      <li>Love this toothpaste.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>Why this is important to me requires another explanation at another time!</li>
      <li>not too sure it makes a difference on our teeth either.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to get a gold star! :)</li>
      <li>They find it to be more tingly than preferred.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve urged my husband to forgo fluoride since our IAOMT dentist made a convincing argument against fluoridation.</li>
      <li>I bought this toothpaste looking for a better alternative to department store toothpaste.</li>
      <li>Love the mouthwash too.  </li>
      <li>I cannot speak to its effectiveness, however, I like the taste of PerioPaste better.</li>
      <li>I love the way it makes my mouth feel.</li>
      <li>My dental hygienist recommended this one, and I&#x27;m pleased with</li>
      <li>Very clean..</li>
      <li>Ingredients are great as it is natural.</li>
      <li>Other than that, delicious!</li>
      <li>I use it along with a water pick and PerioScript for better result and to clean my mouth of bacteria.</li>
      <li>My hygienist has told me that my gums are healing very quickly because I have been using it.  </li>
      <li>Mouth does feel clean but I wish that it soaped up more</li>
      <li>A huge plus is that it is fluoride free.</li>
      <li>Overall it&#x27;s a great product, and we don&#x27;t plan on using anything else.</li>
      <li>I will have to see how my gums are doing closer to the end of the tube to see if the added cost is justified.</li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve now buying the multipack, a more economical choice.  </li>
      <li>My gums and teeth look good so far after a couple weeks using it.</li>
      <li>Worth the money!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried SO many organic toothpastes and this is by far my favorite.</li>
      <li>My teeth feel so clean</li>
      <li>I have tried a number of similar products, so far this is the best!</li>
      <li>But, after  brush, my teeth are really clean, and my mouth feels clean.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t your normal &amp;#34;toothpaste&amp;#34; - because it&#x27;s all organic, and they&#x27;re using plant based products to make the paste, it&#x27;s a very light brown, and it&#x27;s not going to taste like what you&#x27;re used to a toothpaste tasting like if you&#x27;re used to &amp;#34;minty fresh&amp;#34</li>
      <li>Fresh and clean tasting, this toothpaste has been a God-send.  </li>
      <li>Once squeezed onto the toothbrush, it tends to quickly seep in to the bristles.</li>
      <li>And we like that its mint flavor is mild.</li>
      <li>Quick delivery.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s been over a year of using this and no other toothpaste; my husband says the sensitivity protection is still good &amp; wants me to keep it stocked.</li>
      <li>It has a herbal, minty taste which is a little strong but still good.</li>
      <li>This tastes really good and it makes my mouth feel clean, even without all of those additives and chemicals that are found in other toothpastes.</li>
      <li>The texture took a bit getting used to at first, but I like how it made my breath feel minty and fresh without a chemical aftertaste and also seemed to whiten my teeth!</li>
      <li>I use a slightly large pea sized amount then lightly spread it across my teeth before brushing all out.</li>
      <li>but it is definitely worth it.  </li>
      <li>can for sure tell that this is all natural.</li>
      <li>I picked up three recommended pastes from The Kind Life website, this was in the middle for us.</li>
      <li>This is such a great natural toothpaste with no fluroide.</li>
      <li>Just leaves you pleasantly fresh .</li>
      <li>The price is a little bit high, but the product is very good</li>
      <li>I really like the clean, fresh taste it leaves in my mouth.</li>
      <li>I have used many different toothpastes over the years and this is my favorite so far.  </li>
      <li>I like all the ingredients that are in the paste and the fact that is all natural - no harsh chemicals, but honestly, don&#x27;t care for the flavor.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t spread or give you rabies face but seems to glide around your teeth when you brush which i very much like.</li>
      <li>This toothpaste is expensive (about $4 a tube) but you use a pea size amount, it tastes good, but whether it is any better than Crest or Colgate and worth the cost is up for debate.  </li>
      <li>I also love the spearmint (I&#x27;m not a big fan of peppermint).</li>
      <li>The clean feeling lasts for hours and it&#x27;s very gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure all toothpastes do this, but since this one is such a strange color, it&#x27;s much more noticeable.</li>
      <li>We will use up the tube and then decide if it&#x27;s worth paying the high price for another tube.</li>
      <li>From the white splatters in the sink, it also seems to whiten, although it looks light brown right out of the tube.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not disgusting, but it&#x27;s not particularly inviting either.</li>

    <li> The price is a little bit high, but the product is very good</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed this toothpaste! The texture took a bit getting used to at first, but I like how it made my breath feel minty and fresh without a chemical aftertaste and also seemed to whiten my teeth!</li>
    <li> Some time ago a nutritionist had recommended PerioPaste Organic Toothpaste due to its effectiveness and safe ingredients. A huge plus is that it is fluoride free. Why this is important to me requires another explanation at another time! PerioPaste provides wonderful benefits for one&#x27;s oral care. Only a pea-size amount is required. I have found that whether I use an electric or manual toothbrush the results are absolutely great. As a matter of fact at the time that I had consulted with the nutritionist a dental exam showed that there were some issues of inflammation around three areas re: the gums. I used PerioPaste Toothpaste along with the mouthwash by the same brand. In no time at all the inflammation was gone completely!! I continue to use Periopaste Toothpaste and would not use any other brand. My check ups are always \\&quot;Aces\\&quot; now!! Although I do admit to having tried another brand once~~just out of curiosity~~but I was very disappointed with it. You see, there are some so called \\&quot;organic\\&quot; toothpastes that still contain at least one undesirable ingredient. Although I read all labels and ingredients, I missed the&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;no-no\\&quot; in that other brand. However, Periopaste Toothpaste, when compared to other brands, deserves a rating that gives it a \\&quot;clean bill of health\\&quot; for consumer use. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Feels different than your normal generic toothpaste. Mouth does feel clean but I wish that it soaped up more</li>
    <li> needs to be lower priced</li>
    <li> can for sure tell that this is all natural. i like it better than the poison tooth paste they sell at the store for sure!</li>
    <li> Works better than Crest</li>
    <li> We don&#x27;t use florida, so we&#x27;re always on the search for a good toothpaste alternative. My dental hygienist recommended this one, and I&#x27;m pleased with it&#x27;s taste. It&#x27;s appearance is sort of gray goop, so when you spit it in the sink, it definitely needs to be washed away completely, or family will wonder who has poor bathroom manners.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because it is reputedly good for the gums, and it does contain a number of elements which should help with gum health.  It also says it is concentrated, but I find that I use about the same amount as regular toothpaste because it lacks the foaming, expanding character of other pastes.  It is very runny, compared to other pastes, as well.  I like the taste and it seems to do the job. From the white splatters in the sink, it also seems to whiten, although it looks light brown right out of the tube.  I will have to see how my gums are doing closer to the end of the tube to see if the added cost is justified.</li>
    <li> We like that it&#x27;s organic and that it does not contain nasty chemicals or flouride. And we like that its mint flavor is mild. We find the mint flavor of most common commercial brands to be horribly overpowering. However, this stuff has an odd, almost &amp;#34;slimy&amp;#34; texture, and a strange herbal flavor. It&#x27;s not disgusting, but it&#x27;s not particularly inviting either. We will use up the tube and then decide if it&#x27;s worth paying the high price for another tube.</li>
    <li> Very nice tasting toothpaste. Trying to go as organic as possible. Very good cleansing results leaving refreshed mouth. A bit expensive, but well worth it to know it&#x27;s organic. I&#x27;m so tired of all the chemicals in food, makeup and personal products that the FDA allows.  My bit of rebellion against chemicals. Will buy again</li>
    <li> This is such a great natural toothpaste with no fluroide. The taste is nice -- somewhat herbal and refreshing. I have been using this brand for a few years now and haven&#x27;t had any cavitites during that time. I first found out about this brand at the holistic dentist&#x27;s office, but the cost is a bit less here.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled. This product is NOT organic. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Having periodontal disease, one always looks for ways to help reduce future problems.  This toothpaste is expensive (about $4 a tube) but you use a pea size amount, it tastes good, but whether it is any better than Crest or Colgate and worth the cost is up for debate.  I am still using my tube, but not sure I would order again - and my periodontist never heard of it which is not a ringing endorsement either.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is wonderful.  My hygienist has told me that my gums are healing very quickly because I have been using it.  I also use the PerioClear mouthwash.  These products are great!!</li>
    <li> Quick delivery.  Love this product.</li>
    <li> Fresh and clean tasting, this toothpaste has been a God-send.  I use it daily and the gum disease that was beginning in my mouth, completely disappeared!</li>
    <li> Best toothpaste out there!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t spread or give you rabies face but seems to glide around your teeth when you brush which i very much like. I use a slightly large pea sized amount then lightly spread it across my teeth before brushing all out. I like the taste,  earthy mint and not overbearing. Just leaves you pleasantly fresh . The toothpaste is slightly loose unlike usual toothpastes that are very much a solid paste out of the bottle. This did not bother me though. My gums and teeth look good so far after a couple weeks using it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not overly sweet, a big plus for me. The taste is unusual, but very pleasant.It doesn&#x27;t foam up as everybody has come to expect from toothpaste. I&#x27;ve never understood the value of that foam anyway.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot attest to the long term benefits, as I&#x27;ve been using it for just a month. I&#x27;d been turned off by the artificial minty sweetness of commercial toothpastes. This is a welcome relief.</li>
    <li> Certainly not my favorite and will not be purchasing it again. It doesn&#x27;t work as claimed and it&#x27;s much too expensive</li>
    <li> Love it!! Never going to use anyother brand. I was unsure when buying it, it was my first clean toothpaste and will never go back to to store brands</li>
    <li> Love this toothpaste. Leaves your mouth feeling minty and refreshed.</li>
    <li> I really like the clean, fresh taste it leaves in my mouth. I just had my 6-month dental cleaning and the hygienist said I had&lt;br /&gt;very little plaque....much better than my previous report.&lt;br /&gt;Update (May 2014): I am now using Desert Essence&#x27;s Natural Tea Tree Oil toothpaste. I cannot speak to its effectiveness, however, I like the taste of PerioPaste better.</li>
    <li> By and far the best &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and fluoride-free toothpaste out there.  It comes with a high price tag but it is definitely worth it.  Only a small pea-sized amount is needed because of its potency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At one point, my gums were bleeding due to neglect.  Using periopaste almost healed it completely overnight -- certainly within two days.  It was amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently switched to a cheaper version, PerioBrite, because the ingredient listing is identical.  Unfortunately, this version is very &amp;#34;watered down&amp;#34; and noticeably less thick, if that makes sense.  (We actually had a lot leak out of the tube overnight).  Anyway, I&#x27;m switching back to Periopaste.</li>
    <li> I bought this toothpaste looking for a better alternative to department store toothpaste. This tastes really good and it makes my mouth feel clean, even without all of those additives and chemicals that are found in other toothpastes. I&#x27;ll buy again!</li>
    <li> I purchased this toothpaste because I was having problems with bacteria around one of my molars that has never fully grown in.  A PA and nutritionist recommended this toothpaste saying that it would help reduce the bacteria.  I expected this was going to taste bad, but it doesn&#x27;t.  It has a mild and pleasant flavor.  Also, I have noticed a reduction in bacteria evidenced by the reduced bacteria smell coming from that area of my mouth.  I know that sounds gross, but I don&#x27;t know how else to explain it.  I have also begun using a water pic and suspect that next time I go to the dentist I&#x27;m going to get a gold star! :)</li>
    <li> I have tried a few a natural toothpastes and this one is the best by far, it doesn&#x27;t taste weird or bad, it spreads good, and leaves my mouth feeling clean and fresh.  I have noticed my teeth getting whiter over the months too.  This toothpaste is great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this!</li>
    <li> My new holistic dentist sells this product and as soon as I started using it I no longer had to use my teeth whitening gel and tray. It is amazing.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste!! It has a herbal, minty taste which is a little strong but still good. I&#x27;ve even noticed a difference in the whiteness of my teeth. The clean feeling lasts for hours and it&#x27;s very gentle on my sensitive skin. I have had issues with breakouts and rashes around my mouth from toothpastes I&#x27;ve tried before, but I haven&#x27;t had any problems with this one. It is a weird gray/brown color, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me or my boyfriend. The only problem I have with it, is that it leaves a residue in the sink. You have to rinse the sink out really well after brushing. I&#x27;m sure all toothpastes do this, but since this one is such a strange color, it&#x27;s much more noticeable. Overall it&#x27;s a great product, and we don&#x27;t plan on using anything else.</li>
    <li> organic paste makes for a happy mouth</li>
    <li> After 1 month of use and a recent visit to the hygienist, I was told I had no plaque on my teeth.</li>
    <li> I like using a product I know is beneficial to my body and not worry about the toxins that might be in a toothpaste. My biggest worry is that it would not taste good... Not so, it tastes great!</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is great! Tastes good and cleans well. Will definitely recommend it and buy it again!</li>
    <li> I like all the ingredients that are in the paste and the fact that is all natural - no harsh chemicals, but honestly, don&#x27;t care for the flavor.</li>
    <li> I love having an organic toothpaste that cleans and whitens. I also love the spearmint (I&#x27;m not a big fan of peppermint).</li>
    <li> I picked up three recommended pastes from The Kind Life website, this was in the middle for us. It tastes fine, but still not a great clean and morning mouth. Himalaya Pomegranate was the leader for us.</li>
    <li> The only thing bad about this toothpaste is the price.  Perhaps a bit too spicy for children.  Other than that, delicious!</li>
    <li> Love the way it cleans</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s okay. It doesn&#x27;t really whiten our teeth and not too sure it makes a difference on our teeth either. I may have to give it some time but it&#x27;s been 1 month already.</li>
    <li> UPDATE March 2014:  it&#x27;s been over a year of using this and no other toothpaste; my husband says the sensitivity protection is still good &amp; wants me to keep it stocked. We&#x27;ve now buying the multipack, a more economical choice.  Very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve urged my husband to forgo fluoride since our IAOMT dentist made a convincing argument against fluoridation. Periopaste has bacteria inhibiting herbs and no fluoride, so I bought it.  My husband likes it so much he stopped using the Crest sensitive I&#x27;ve been trying to pry him away from for years.  I would definitely use this too, but have allergy to a listed ingredient.  His last teeth cleaning &amp; exam showed a marked improvement in oral health, obtained in the six months of using periopaste along with d**** h*** tooth and gums tonic (while keeping his run of the mill toothbrush) This turned out to be a very good investment. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Try it and you will be a fan forever. No fluoride and helps dental health. I love the way it makes my mouth feel.</li>
    <li> very good natural all ingredients and organic and contains no flouride, very nice taste, very pleased with my toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Since using it even my dentist noticed a very possitive difference in my overall tooth health!</li>
    <li> I have used almost 1/2 tube and I do believe my gums are slowly healing.  The taste is surprisingly pleasant, not like a &amp;#34;medicine&amp;#34;. I bought two tubes so when these run out I&#x27;ll buy more. I have tried a number of similar products, so far this is the best!</li>
    <li> just what i expected.  excellent service - very fast - even during the holiday season.&lt;br /&gt;look forward to using it</li>
    <li> My mouth feels better already!! Very clean..</li>
    <li> I like the flavor and my tooth sensitivity is a lot less when using this.</li>
    <li> I wanted something to brush my teeth with that was organic, but would be healing to my gums. This product is organic, but I think my gums ... or what ever is going on is too far into the process for this to help, so I can&#x27;t really give a critical analysis of this product for gum health. But, after  brush, my teeth are really clean, and my mouth feels clean. It isn&#x27;t your normal &amp;#34;toothpaste&amp;#34; - because it&#x27;s all organic, and they&#x27;re using plant based products to make the paste, it&#x27;s a very light brown, and it&#x27;s not going to taste like what you&#x27;re used to a toothpaste tasting like if you&#x27;re used to &amp;#34;minty fresh&amp;#34;. I&#x27;ve been using Ayurvedic toothpaste for a long time - it&#x27;s my fav - so I alternate it with this one, and I didn&#x27;t expect this one to taste minty.&lt;br /&gt;Once I get to a holistic dentist and get my teeth fixed, I&#x27;ll have to see what it does for my gums.&lt;br /&gt;Based on the ingredients and their healing properties, I&#x27;d recommend.</li>
    <li> I use it along with a water pick and PerioScript for better result and to clean my mouth of bacteria.</li>
    <li> This is awesome paste.  I have been using this toothpaste for several months now and my mouth feels cleaner and my teeth look even whiter.  Great ingredients.  Love the mouthwash too.  I have used many different toothpastes over the years and this is my favorite so far.  Will continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using PerioPaste I feel like I just had a cleaning at the dental office.</li>
    <li> Love it! My teeth feel so clean and I really like the flavor. I&#x27;ve tried SO many organic toothpastes and this is by far my favorite. Worth the money!</li>
    <li> Very nice, does what it says!</li>
    <li> best toothpaste sofar</li>
    <li> I bought this for my kids. They find it to be more tingly than preferred. That would probably not be a problem for many adults. Ingredients are great as it is natural. The one negative I have it the liquidy consistency compared to other toothpastes. Once squeezed onto the toothbrush, it tends to quickly seep in to the bristles. It is a bit runny and since my kids are using it, it tends to be messy. Even ants come to their bathroom for the taste of the toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I found this toothpaste when I was looking for one without any toxic ingredients but I did not expect a natural toothpaste to literally be the best one I have ever used.  It makes my mouth so tingly and clean feeling and after only one week of using it, my teeth are brighter and whiter than I have been able to get them with other whitening toothpastes.  But it is really just the clean and &amp;#34; healthy&amp;#34; feeling that this toothpaste leaves in my mouth that is the best part.  So glad I found it!</li>
    <li> I used to get stomach aches in the morning after brushing my teeth with conventional tooth paste. After some researching, I decided to try natural tooth paste and came across this product and oh boy, no more stomach aches!!!; teeth feel cleaner and whiter and my dentist complimented me on the health of my teeth. Try it, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> Good Toothpaste Overpriced</li>
    <li> Too expensive for what it is. I have used Natures Gate toothpaste for quite awhile now and in my opinion it is much better and half the price.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite toothpaste, works better than anything I&#x27;ve used before in terms of whiteness, cleanliness, and breath freshening.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s brown, tastes different</li>
