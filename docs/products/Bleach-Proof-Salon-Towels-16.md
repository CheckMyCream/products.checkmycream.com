    <li> I bleach the living daylights out of them every time I wash them and they still look great!</li>
    <li> I have only had the chance to use a few of these but so far they&#x27;re great. They did not fade or bleed in the washer.</li>
    <li> Great towels, great price.</li>
    <li> these towels have been perfect for my husband to bring along to his daily workouts at OrangeTheory!</li>
    <li> Love this product so much we are thinking of ordering another pack to keep spares!</li>
    <li> Love them! They feel thin but they do their job and stain Free. They look good and perfext size dor hair salon. Looks like theyll last long for now. Price is right. Definitely buying more when I need to.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Work great for the gym. Absorbent without being bulky.</li>
    <li> good for my salon,for coloring</li>
    <li> These hand towels are really nice for the price.  At 16 By 27 they&#x27;re big enough for facial use or hand drying.  I would compare them to the towels one finds in spas or other commercial enterprises.  They&#x27;re well stitched and the cotton doesn&#x27;t all come off in the first washing.  I wanted them primarily for home use because I&#x27;m always forgetting and bleaching colors at home now ( I call them Senior Moments and the results from the bleached load of wash Senior Mementos) so I try and buy all my colors in bleach safe materials now.  I&#x27;ve already forgotten and bleached them and they came out fine, just as black as when I put them in.  (Just a note here to let folks know that almost every bleach safe fabric can be thwarted if you put a ton of bleach in, I&#x27;ve got a neighbor who does that and then she complains about the manufacturer&#x27;s poor product...even though I keep telling her that a bottle of bleach should last longer than two or three loads!).  At ten for twenty bucks and a choice of black or brown you can&#x27;t go wrong with these.  After several washes now they have remained black and they have remained soft and thirsty.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> delivered as promised</li>
    <li> I have been using these towels in my salon for about six weeks now. We do a lot of color and they get washed at least once everyday with hot water and are still true to color. I bought similar towels from my local sales rep and they weren&#x27;t as soft so I purchased these a second time from amazon. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have a small Hair Salon and we bought these towels and they are very nice and thick. We have been using them daily for over a month now and a very happy with them. We will definitely order more as we need them</li>
    <li> I use them for my workouts at the gym. Towels are great for the price</li>
    <li> I purchased the towels recently and have been using them at the gym daily. They are perfect for wiping sweat off yourself or wiping the equipment down after you sweated like a beast! These towels are not only great for the gym, but can also hold up in the house as well. Good quality for a great price.</li>
    <li> Awesome! First year salon owner and I am very happy with this product</li>
    <li> I will buy this from this seller again and again, I use them as kitchen towels and they really hold their color.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I can say...&lt;br /&gt;The product arrived promptly, they are traditional salon towels (perfect for mani/pedi use) and haven&#x27;t really faded in the wash. BUT since you get 10 in a pack I&#x27;ve only had to wash them a few times.&lt;br /&gt;So far they have met my expectations.</li>
    <li> nice quality for the price</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed and wanted! Very absorbent and softer than I expected.</li>
