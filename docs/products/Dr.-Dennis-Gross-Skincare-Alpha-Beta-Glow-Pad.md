      <li>I love this product so much.  </li>

      <li>They clear up my skin and give me a nice tan without any streaking.</li>
      <li>Just make sure you cover your whole face in the circular motions, so it is even.</li>
      <li>was worried about using a tanning product because my face can break-out easily and is very dry.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
      <li>The color is more natural.  </li>
      <li>My face looks freshly tanned (not orange) and it glows.</li>

      <li>This stuff really works!</li>
      <li>I love the idea of exfoiliating &amp; tanning at the same time.</li>

      <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how much deeper and darker</li>

      <li>Beware these are not the size of normal tanning towels.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re not streaky or fake looking, however, make sure you cover your neck and ears as well, as this product works the very first time!</li>

      <li>This may work better with back-to-back daily uses, or for those with a little less color than myself.</li>
      <li>but you may think twice before putting on your face esp if you have white (Irish) sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I ended up only using a half of one because the full sheet made me wayyy to dark.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this for my face but after one use, I will only use on my arms. When I used on my face it made all my unknown sunspots very dark and freaky. It was great for my arms, gave me a hint of color and no drying or stinky smell.  A good product but you may think twice before putting on your face esp if you have white (Irish) sensitive skin. May work better for people that tan nicely.</li>
    <li> These glow pads definitely work. They&#x27;re not streaky or fake looking, however, make sure you cover your neck and ears as well, as this product works the very first time! Color was natural though and lasted a couple of days.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and perfect tan after one application!  It dries in minutes and I put my face lotion right on afterwards.</li>
    <li> Beware these are not the size of normal tanning towels. I had to send them back because they are so small that it would barely tan one arm and would start to roll up in my hand. It should be described as sample size.</li>
    <li> I use these wipes throughout the year, especially in the winter when we feel a little pale. They give me a nice glow, without being orange. I am usually sensitive to facial tanning products, but no breakouts with this product. Love love love it!</li>
    <li> Awesome product.  I&#x27;m fair skinned with freckles, and this gave me a fairly natural looking glow to my face that lasted for several days.</li>
    <li> I love this product so much.  I always make sure I have some in stock.  They clear up my skin and give me a nice tan without any streaking.</li>
    <li> For years I&#x27;d been using Comodynes Self-Tanning Towelettes. The Comodynes always gave me a very even, non-orangey colored tan. One day my roommate came home and gave me a sample packet of these that she got from Sephora. I can&#x27;t tell you how much deeper and darker the tan is that these give. It&#x27;s like night and day, compared to what I was using. I love them and have officially switched!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Makes being over 50 tolerable. Never going to go back to old product.&lt;br /&gt;Why would I?</li>
    <li> This is a very good product,particularly for the face. A rich color lasts for 3-4 days. I have ordered this on two different occasions and would find it hard to try something else. Very satisfied</li>
    <li> I love these glow pads.  I cut each pad into thirds and use every 2-3 days.  I don&#x27;t like to wear much makeup and I usually burn instead of tan, so this gives me a little tan all year long.  Looks natural.  Just make sure you cover your whole face in the circular motions, so it is even.</li>
    <li> I haqve used this products for 2 years.  It goes on evenly and is long lasting.  Healthy Glow and tan look requires little makeup.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I&#x27;ll be in a wedding soon, and didn&#x27;t want to look like a ghost.&lt;br /&gt;I was worried about using a tanning product because my face can break-out easily and is very dry.&lt;br /&gt;My skin felt &amp; looked great after using. I would recommend to wait at least 8 hours before a second application unless you want a deep tan. I just wanted a little color, which one application provides. I didn&#x27;t look orange with 2 applications, though. Just more tan than I wanted.</li>
    <li> I love the idea of exfoiliating &amp; tanning at the same time. The next day my face matches the rest of my body. My face looks freshly tanned (not orange) and it glows. Wish the clothes didn&#x27;t leave little particles on my face tho. But other than that, it&#x27;s a wonderful product!</li>
    <li> I bought a small pack of these but am just about to buy more. They make your skin nice and smooth. The pads have some light exofliation to them, and provide a warm soft glow to your skin. I found that you can use the pad to develop different depths of color. You can use the same pad once around your face or a few times if you want to get darker.</li>
    <li> One of the best beauty products I have ever used. It gives your skin a wonderful glow and is anti-aging as well. I have been buying these for the last few years and wouldn&#x27;t go without them.</li>
    <li> This product was okay, but didn&#x27;t provide much &#x27;glow&#x27;.  Gave a subtle color and did exfoliate well. This may work better with back-to-back daily uses, or for those with a little less color than myself.</li>

    <li> This stuff really works! Be careful though. I ended up only using a half of one because the full sheet made me wayyy to dark. Only apply to the area once for nice color. Anymore than that and I think it is just to dark.</li>
    <li> These towlettes work pretty well.  I notice an instant sheen after using and they really do help to exfoliate the skin.  The color does not last very long, but they work well in a pinch if you just want a bit of color added.  One use per towelette only.</li>
