    <li> My daughter is my best critic. She loves it on me and so do I. She said it makes me look wide awake.</li>
    <li> I love this concealer. It has awesome coverage depending on how thick you apply it. More layers more coverage. It also lasts like a foundation which I mostly use it as. I like ordering this in 3 piece sets or more. One tube has already lasted over a month for me useing it daily as a foundation.</li>
    <li> My undereye concealer is NW 40, and under my eyebrow I use NW 35. I am not a huge make up person and I am still learning how to apply everything. I like my minimal makeup to look natural. I&#x27;ve learned less is more (for me) when it comes to the LA Girl Pro Concealer. Also I ended up purchasing this one (cool tan) and warm honey because I wasn&#x27;t sure which color would work for me and I ended up needing to mix these colors to fit my skin. I&#x27;m still perfecting it that&#x27;s why I gave it 3 stars. At the end of the day I kinda like just using my NW 35 studios fix concealer as a highlighter because it doesn&#x27;t crease up on me and my skin likes it. Not that the LA Girl one creases cuz it doesn&#x27;t, I think my issue is perfecting the amount to use and the color. I&#x27;m still learning. SHIPPING WAS VERY FAST AND I WOULD BUY FROM THIS VENDOR!</li>
    <li> I love the LA girls concealers! They are so cheap but they conceal blemishes and it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Great product I bought so that I don&#x27;t waste my Mac studio fix concealer. I&#x27;m an nc45 so the color fawn is perfect but I also got cool tan for highlighting</li>
    <li> Like the way it goes on. Plus, it doesn&#x27;t produce too much creasing. Will be buying more tones; lighter shades for highlighting.</li>
    <li> I bought five of these and ALL the colors looked the same which was really disappointing. Not sure if I am into the hype.</li>
    <li> I use it to shape up my eye brow to define them to make them look natural and it works very well. All you need it a very tiny bit. I think this will last me more than two year. I recommend it to any woman who likes to do makeup. It also works very well as an eye shadow</li>
    <li> Great concealer at a great price! Will be purchasing every cool for my kit &amp; this color for myself! Definitely a go to concealer if your lookin for something just as good thats not to pricey. Love it!</li>
    <li> Recieved it very fast I love it definitely repurchasing !</li>
    <li> Great full coverage; these concealers are amazing! I use this shade to conceal marks on inner face face - forehead and outer perimeter are slightly darker. (for reference: I&#x27;m a mac nc 42-44, depending on product, revlon toast (370), and Iman sand 5/clay 1)</li>
    <li> i use this along with my l.a. colors liquid makeup in the color tan to highlight my face.&lt;br /&gt;they are part of the same company. they work well together too.</li>
    <li> I use it for contouring and it works really good, I don&#x27;t really like the fact that there is very little product in the tube...so even at the first use I had to squeeze it...and it took a while for the product to come out.</li>
    <li> This is my perfect shade! I wear Toast in the Revlon ColorStay liquid foundation and this concealer matches my skin tone perfectly! I go a shade up and use medium beige when I need a highlighter. Blends easily for great full coverage. price is great and this concealer performs just as well as more expensive brands. I love the slim brush applicator, its fairly precise and doesn&#x27;t clog up. I absolutely loved it and will be repurchasing this in the near future!</li>
    <li> It was way to dark for my under eyes but I figured a way out to make it look light but its a good product</li>
    <li> I use this daily,  the applicator is great for creating those sharp, defined eyebrows. I sometimes have a little clogging but it&#x27;s cleared pretty easily.</li>
    <li> Concealer was good - but it&#x27;s not a lot of product. I will have to order more soon. It took 9 days to get to me. will purchase from diff seller next time</li>
    <li> This concealer is very good and it covers very well and not creamy good for people with oily skin</li>
    <li> The Best Ever My Go To</li>
    <li> Really good I wear it every day</li>
    <li> Perfect for use every day with your makeup.  Really smooth</li>
