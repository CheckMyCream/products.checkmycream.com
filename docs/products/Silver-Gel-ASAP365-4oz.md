    <li> I love how it goes on &amp; it has helped the psoriasis on my feet tremendously!</li>
    <li> I love the stuff I put it on every kind of bite scratch boo-boo anything</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my upper arms for eczema and it is a miracle lotion.  Sometimes my arms would itch so badly in the night that I&#x27;d wake up and they would be bleeding from me scratching.  Since I started using this product, I have not had the severe itch and the skin on my arms looks 99% clearer than it did.  I read the reviews on this product before purchasing and purchased as a skeptic but I am now a believer.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. We keep some on  hand at all times.</li>
    <li> Great product, heals wounds quickly.</li>
    <li> Great product for my acne skin!</li>
    <li> Heals everything, slap it on don&#x27;t even wash, and wrap for three days, then remove and wrap again for 3 days, II have had injures where I should have had stitches to reattach, and this did the job, can&#x27;t even tell where it happened. Plus healed my animals, with anything.</li>
    <li> We have been very pleased with the performance of this product. My husband has been diabetic for 35 years, and any little scrape or bump to his lower legs would take forever to heal, and usually would require medical attention with antibiotics for 10 days.&lt;br /&gt;We began using the Silver Biotics topically on any scrapes, and were truly amazed at the results! The wounds didn&#x27;t turn angry red as in the past, and healed in less than half the time, no doctor or antibiotics necessary! Thank the Lord for guiding us to this item, and Amazon has such good prices and service! We purchase so many things through them, and we have since bought a few more tubes to have on hand. (We are still on the first tube which we purchased in May 2014; one tube is 4oz and lasts a really long time.)&lt;br /&gt;We also purchased Natural Path Silver Wings Dietary Mineral Supplement, Colloidal Silver, 500 PPM, 4 fl. oz. / 120 ml here on Amazon, which is a great product that can be diluted with bottled water and taken orally, as well as applied topically.</li>
