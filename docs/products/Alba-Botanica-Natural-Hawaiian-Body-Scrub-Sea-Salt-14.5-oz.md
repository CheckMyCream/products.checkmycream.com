<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This salt scrub smells wonderful. The salt is a bit huge and it is oily but I like it overall</li>
    <li> This scrub is perfect! I&#x27;m allergic to scented scrubs, body washes but this is perfect! It left my skin feeling so soft!!! And it smells so tropical after you use it</li>
    <li> I really like this scrub, but I do have to warn that you need to be REALLY careful in the tub with it!  The oil makes for a slick tub when you&#x27;re rinsing, just FYI.  The smell is wonderful, but use it sparingly because there is such thing as too much of a good thing.  The first time I used it, I used too much so my skin felt oily all day and I ended up taking another shower in the evening.  When you use it right, your skin feels amazing and like other reviewers said, there is no need to use any moisturizer afterward. Highly recommend for people in dry climates.</li>
    <li> The best scrub around....very moisturizing and the granules are large....really does the trick!  You won&#x27;t be sorry especially if you have EXTREMELY DRY SKIN!</li>
    <li> I totally love this scrub.  It is a good value and smells sooooo good.  With no added chemicals, it&#x27;s a product I feel good about using and lasts!</li>
    <li> It does what it says.....great exfoliator but is pretty greasy/oily.  Only for that did I not give it 5 stars</li>
    <li> I love this scrub!  It has the best aroma and is all natural ingredients.  It received a positive rating on cosmetic data website for safety of it&#x27;s ingredients.  I use it most in the summer, but it is also good to keep skin hydrated in the winter.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  Used at the end of a shower, it works great.  I don&#x27;t even have to use lotion and it keeps my skin soft for a couple days.  Smells invigorating too, not perfumey.  Do rinse the shower out though, it could be slippery.  UPDATE:  Can&#x27;t remember when I wrote the above review, been using it for years.  2016 - I am disappointed.  I ordered 3 and something went wrong.  It smells like an old sock - NO citrus at all.  I checked 2.  Possible that I got a bad batch, but when contacting the website on the jar, they just said the formula had not changed and goodbye.  The &amp;#34;skin effect&amp;#34; of good moisturizing still works, but once these are gone, I&#x27;ll be looking for another salt body scrub that doesn&#x27;t smell like the hamper.  IMPORTANT UPDATE again; (sorry)  Contacted Alba about the smell, not only did they give me a very generous coupon, but they also had an explanation for the smell.  This time of year, you never know how long your package will be in a warehouse/truck.  And in MT, or many other places, it will be below freezing, ergo, the change in smell.  Makes total sense to me now.  Thank You Alba.  Great customer service.</li>
    <li> This product smells wonderful and feels great during application but is WAY too greasy/oily for my liking.  Also, the salt crystals are slightly large.  It leaves a heavy oily film which needs to be washed off.  My skin does feel soft and smells great.  But, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I picked up this body scrub on a whim about a month ago to try. I have to say that this is the best body scrub I have ever used. It leaves my skin so soft that I don&#x27;t need to use lotion after I get out of the shower and the aroma of the scrub is very refreshing. When this product sits the oil and crystals do separate (Which happens in most products that contain oil)  but all you have to do is just turn it upside down for a few minutes (Long enough to wash your hair) and when you are ready to use it its fine.</li>
    <li> It leaves a very wonderful ocean sun kissed fragrance! It is a great exfoliate and moisturizes with the added oils leaving skin soft.</li>
    <li> The salt crysrals are way to big and left tiny scratches on my leg, and this stuff is so oily that I had to soap up after using it, which defeats any moisturizing possibility.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Equivalent products sell for 3x as much yet have less potency. It feels great and it SMELLS great. There are like a dozen different oils in it. You essentially rub the salt with the condensed oils on your hands and the end result is extremely soft hands. Awesome ! Finish by rinsing and use lamb cream - and it has given me very good results. Great product. Will be buying it for a long time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pierre Kerbage</li>
    <li> I bought this scrub because someone said if you have chicken skin (keratosis pilaris) that it will get rid of it. I would say that&#x27;s very true! I like this scrub but my only complaint is that it leaves my skin/hands pretty oily/greasy after use but besides that, it smells nice and the crystals aren&#x27;t too big</li>
    <li> This Sea Salt scrub is fantastic. Smells great, easy to apply from the jar, and leaves your skin soft. It leaves a slight amount of oil on your skin to help retain moisture. I love this product. I will continue to buy from this seller.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  It is soooo soothing and makes your skin feel soft and adds a lot of moisture to your skin....also exfoliates.  I&#x27;m totally hooked on it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Alba sugar scrub for about a year now, which is a good product. But I much prefer this one! A reviewer made a comment about the granules being larger than she is used to, I particularly love this! The sugar scrub, although the scent is AMAZING btw, the granules are not that big and the sugar quickly dissolves before too long. This salt scrub lasts me longer because of the larger granules, smells just as delicious, and the oil feels oh so silky. So I bought in bulk! :) This Alba salt scrub is reasonably priced. I had an issue with my bulk shipment and customer service was fast and reliable! Thank you Alba, my skin loves this scrub!</li>
    <li> Just starting using it. The granules are very large compared to other scrubs. Still evaluating that part. The ingredients do separate so be aware that it has to be mixed up before every use and the oils are a little hard to mix in and have spilled a bit while the container was still full. I am sure as the amount goes down, there will be less spillage. If you do not have sensitive skin ie: wool, scratchy fabric, this may be fine for you. I am not yet sure if I will get use to the coarseness. I will use the whole product and evaluate before I re-order. It does seem like a quality product so my critiques are more my issues than with the product itself as I use other Alba Botanical products that I love. I do prefer a squeeze bottle in the shower but at this price I thought I would give it a try. I am not unhappy but may go another way next time and it may be another AB product.</li>
    <li> This is just okay.  The salt pieces are way too big, so instead of being an even scrub, the pieces just fall off very quickly.  It doesn&#x27;t matter if you use your hand, a wash cloth or scrub; it just falls off and you&#x27;re left with a fraction of the salt actually doing the scrubbing.  And there is a big design flaw, the pieces of salt get stuck on the rim, even if you do your best to wipe them off, so you can&#x27;t fully close the top.  If it ends up getting knocked over (say your dog knocks it into the tub and you don&#x27;t find it for another hour), then all the oil leaks out.&lt;br /&gt;So now I&#x27;m left with a jar of salt and a tiny bit of oil.  I&#x27;ve been mixing it with my other body wash because I paid money for it and I&#x27;m going to use it up!&lt;br /&gt;It did have a lovely scent.  I was on the fence with how thick the oils were on my skin, even after rinsing it but I didn&#x27;t have it for long enough to get a good opinion on the oil.  I&#x27;m going to try this brands sugar scrub next, because I feel like that is going to have the smaller kernels that I like.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an amazing scrub! However, I feel their is more oil than the actual sea salt to exfoliate your skin. It exfoliates for a few seconds, but then it just kinds of goes away. But, it leaves your skin so soft and glowy afterwards because of the oil. The smell is just amazing. It smells like lemon and so citrusy! Overall, it&#x27;s a good scrub, I just wish there was more sea salts in it.</li>
    <li> I really love this scrub!  I have used many different salt scrubs and this has to be my favorite so far.  The scent is amazing and the oils are great for my bone dry skin.  I wish they would make a perfume that smelled like this.  I agree that the granules are larger, but I think it works just as well as other finer scrubs I have used.  I would also recommend buying from Amazon, since they seem to sell it at a significantly lower price than I&#x27;ve seen in stores.</li>
    <li> I have used similar more expensive scrub in the past and I like the natural oils in it. The smell is good. I did not like VEY BIG salt chrystals. They scratched me, left decent scratches the first time I used the scrub. It is really good for the lower part of my body becase the upper part is way too gentle for it. Overall it is OK for the price. It would be much better if the salt chrystals were smaller like in Arbonne body scrub.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for someone battling extra dry skin. The product delivers on first use instantly!   Nice Fresh smell in the shower and out!</li>
    <li> This has nice large salt pieces to do a good scrub.  I get ingrown hairs on legs due to waxing and this does a great job of helping with those.  It smells amazing.  It is very &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; not sure how else to describe.  But the oils are very soothing and makes your skin so soft.  I find I have no need for body lotion after using this product, it is great at exfoliating and moisturizing.  Have purchased twice now and will again!  I have used many similar products and this is the one I come back to.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product ofter using some of a friend&#x27;s.  It is amazing!  It leaves my skin so soft and smooth.  The biggest plus factor for me is the smell.  It is more of a citrus smell and not a flowery prefume smell.  I have a very senstive nose and can not handle those smells...they give me a headache.  My husband has allergies and can&#x27;t handle them either.  This has a smell that we both loved.  Honestly my only complaint would be that it runs out quickly.  I will have to find a solution to that!</li>
    <li> I used this product once. It smells great and exfoliates great. However, my skin was extremely dry after using the product. So that is a no in my book! I don&#x27;t want a product that is going to make my skin dryer; That is the last thing I need.</li>
    <li> Does the job but it is a little watery. I need a natural product and I love the scent.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and how smooth my skin is. Very little chemicals in it if any. I came back and bought more.</li>
    <li> I like it. Not the best I have used. Leaves a thick oily film on your skin, which I don&#x27;t like. I ended up  dumping out most of the oil, so it won&#x27;t be so bad. I love the scent. That part is great. My skin felt pretty soft. But everything started sticking to me, from the oil residue. I ended up jumping back in the shower, and putting it super hot, and scrubbing hard to get it off. Once I dumped the oil, it isn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
    <li> More oil than scrub --- you get what you pay for --- pass on this</li>
    <li> Its very greasy!  It works but I had to drain oil out of it to get to the scrub.</li>
    <li> I love Alba products! But when it comes to exfoliating my skin, this is my absolute suggestion:  http://amzn.to/1HuUex6  ...this product (link) is truly heaven sent! I was having a really dull complexion and I tried all these scrubs... yes, both the pharmacy products and the natural ones but the effects are so fleeting. So I did a very good research and that&#x27;s what I found. Finally I tried it for myself and boy, my skin glows like crazy!!! Sometimes, the simplest things in life give us the most pleasure, and this is one of them. Once you try this for yourself, you&#x27;ll know that I&#x27;m not even exaggerating. make sure you watch youtube vids on how to use it  correctly to achieve the maximum result.</li>
    <li> My kids LOVE this scrub as much as I do.  I recently gave one as a present and she loved it too!  So luxurious!  And smells heavenly!</li>
    <li> This stuff makes my skin feel super moisturized, and the smell is Heavenly! If you like the smell of pineapples this is amazing. I will say if you are not used to scrubs go easy as the salt is kind of coarse for a first time user but I really like this product. I was worried the first time I used it because there is some oil in it and I thought I would break out but it did not have that effect at all. The oil absorbed into my skin wonderfully and I smelled like I just stepped into a tropical wonderland.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, it smells so good and leaves my skin fresh.  Great for making your skin feel young again!</li>
    <li> This is a product that will make you feel like you&#x27;ve just come from a spa.  After my shower, my skin seems to glow. I use it for my elbows and knees.  My skin feels so silky and smooth. I probably sound like a commercial, but believe me, anyone who tries it will be happy with the results.</li>
    <li> Just not as good as other products. Small is eh. I would go for Dead Sea products over this any day of the week.</li>
    <li> I loooove this product!! It smells like lime and coconut and makes you feel like you&#x27;re in a tropical paradise. It leaves your skin so smooth and moisturized. Something I will keep on hand.</li>
    <li> Best scrub I&#x27;ve found and smells beyond wonderful : - D Moisturizes and sloughs off dry skin.  and leaves you soft and smelling wonderful</li>
    <li> Love it, leaves your skin feeling wonderful!</li>
    <li> I have tried different body scrubs and this product outshines all! It is oil and salt based, it clearly describes it containing such. With a salt scrub, the oil helps to keep your skin soft. I don&#x27;t find it leaving unwanted residue, you will have a small amount on you, but when you dry off with a towel, all that is left is absorbed. Yes, if you have small cuts or bug bites, the salt will clean them out and it does sting  a little, just a little. I am a photographer and hike and travel a lot, I take this with me on all my trips for many reasons, I don&#x27;t need lotion, removes dry skin and also for the skin softening aspect, so the salt portion also is useful for the minor abrasions and bug bites to keep me from infections.  The smell is wonderful, I also use this in the tub. I have not tried it in the shower, I am sure you would shower first, turn off water, salt scrub then rinse. I don&#x27;t find it leaves a mess in the tub, rinses right out. The salt crystals are large so I think it works better then the small ones I use to use.</li>
    <li> I really like this scrub and it&#x27;s a great price. I recently began a job that involves a lot of paper cuts and pretty sever drying of my skin so I decided I needed to find something that would scrub away the dead skin and callouses, help heal and moisturize to prevent them altogether. I was using De Ja Vu Green Tea Dead Sea Salt body scrub (love it), but it&#x27;s almost twice as much money as the Alba Hawaiian Body Scrub so I figured what the heck maybe I&#x27;ll find a cheaper gem and I believe I did. When you open it there will be a ton of oil at the top so be careful or you will be an oily mess. I tried to mix it in with the salt as much as I could and then put some on my hands and started to scrub. Make sure you rinse well to ensure you get all of the oil off, but after you&#x27;re done you don&#x27;t even feel like you need lotion. The granules of salt are a bit larger then in other salt scrubs, but I have no issue with it. They aren&#x27;t to rough because of the oil and it actually helps heal any cuts.The oils are amazing and I personally don&#x27;t feel greasy at all after I rinse, just really well moisturized. As I&#x27;ve said before I use this only on my hands, but it would wonderful as a full body scrub as well.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Smells lovely with pleasant citrus notes.  Left my skin smooth and soft.  It does leave a layer of oil on you like most similar products.  It&#x27;s nice to use at night then slip into Jammie&#x27;s and bed, wake up with amazingly soft skin.  I prefer the salt scrubs over the sugar scrubs, they seem more effective at smoothing skin.</li>
    <li> Honestly I never really review things - but I was so impressed with this scrub I felt inclined to! I bought it completely on a whim at CVS because my skin had felt quite dry and my color had become a little uneven throughout the sunny summer. It leaves your skin so soft you won&#x27;t need to use lotion after the shower! I love the soft, slightly oily feel that it leaves as well, gives your skin a stunning glow! The smell is so pleasant and stays with you after the shower, light and refreshing - no overpowering essential oily smell! I really love the fact that the salt granules are larger because they do not dissolve so quick like smaller granules or sugar scrubs and you can really exfoliate so much more with so much less of the scrub! The price is incredible given the quality and the fact that you can pick it up at any given drug store around the corner. I would expect something like this to be in a speciality spa store and cost like $40.00! I would absolutely suggest it to anyone that tends to splurge on nice scrubs/products to indulge your skin in- this way you get the quality for a quarter of the price! I&#x27;ll be stocking up and can&#x27;t wait to feel great with this scrub saving my skin over the winter!</li>
    <li> very carefully packaged from abe&#x27;s Market and it is a glass jar. The Product smells heavenly and the scrub is gentle. They have wonderful natural products on their website. check it out. Happy shopping :D</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t love the smell.</li>
    <li> I love the smell but I&#x27;m pretty sure my husband is going to break his neck in the shower. The oil that the scrubbing salt sits in is very slippery. You can&#x27;t help but drip it on the shower floor when you scoop it out and it doesn&#x27;t rinse from the tiles easily. I&#x27;m gonna find something that&#x27;s just straight sugar/salt and less oil.</li>
    <li> I like just about every product I use from Alba. I like this product because it leaves my skin beautiful and soft after each use. I would recommend the use of any of their products.</li>
    <li> No....this is the best of the best! The shower and me smell yummy after use. It has just the right amount of oil for my skin and I almost hate to dry off for fear of losing the scent. Oh yeah, it exfolliates well too!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. It smells FANTASTIC, like orange and lemon and grapefruit. Feels fantastic... I put it on a scrub brush and do my back with it and it keeps my back from itching in dry weather. Love this stuff and will definately buy again.</li>
    <li> I trust Alba products - they keep all of the ugly chemicals out and ethically test their stuff.  Plus, they make amazing stuff.  I was looking for a new, weekly exfoliating scrub and this perfectly fits the bill.  My only minor warning is that it makes the shower floor slick so be careful!</li>
    <li> My hands are often dry during the winter and this product is perfect for keeping my hands moisturized, soft, and supple.</li>
    <li> FYI, this body scrub has plesant smell, but has very large salt grains, is very harsh on skin when scrubbing, I like a fine salt grains scrub not like rock salt, I have tough skin, not dainty sensitive skin either. Plus it was very thick oil. Horrible large salt crystals!!! They need to use finer salt crystals and less oil.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;You get what you pay for&amp;#34;!  The crystals are revitalizing,  However, the product has a lot of baby oil that pools in the center after a couple of uses.  No fragrance</li>
    <li> love this scrub...Nuitribulled it to a finer consistancy.  Use it as a face scrub. Smell is wonderful, oils make my skin so soft.&lt;br /&gt;Prior to this bought Bare Minerals scrub...paid 122.00.  This is just as good and smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> Love this body scrub. It leaves my skin so soft and smells wonderful. Perfect escape for a winter in the northern states!</li>
    <li> One of my faves that I like to keep in stock at home.  I try to never run out.</li>
    <li> Love this product. You really have to be careful when opening this. The oils go on top. But mix and then use. My skin feels wonderful after each use.</li>
    <li> DEF. RECOMMEND&lt;br /&gt;It last a lot longer than you may think, I would only think you&#x27;d need to&lt;br /&gt;use it once or so a week, depending on your type of skin of course.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start with the positives - it smells amazing! And the large salt granules really slough off every bit of dead skin. However.... it&#x27;s SO oily. I mean *extremely oily*. I had trouble getting the oil off of my body/hands afterwards and you could see oil standing on top of the water in the tub afterwards. That was a big turn-off for me. There are definitely better scrubs out there.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great has natural ingredients and feels like it moisturizes your skin.  I&#x27;ve bought it twice and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> Great scent, not overpowering.  Leaves skin soft without being too oily.</li>
    <li> Wife is happy with this sea salt scrub, and I&#x27;m happy, too.&lt;br /&gt;Price was nice too!</li>
    <li> love it. although it is not large so I hesitate to use it on my whole body. I mainly use it for my chest and neck area.</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry skin on my calves, especially during Iowa winters.  This is the only scrub that solves this issue.  I hesitate to give it a good review for fear of it becoming unavailable.</li>
    <li> Should have listened to other reviewers. There was about a 1/4 of an inch of pure oil floating on to of the jar when opened. When I applied it I thought it would wash off, it didn&#x27;t. My face was so full of oil I had to wash it 2 times afterwards too get the oil off. I dumped the excess oil off the top, and might try it again, but I&#x27;m reluctant to do so.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for the past 2-3 months and I honestly would recommend this for dry skin types. It is really oily!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is olive color and I have dry patches of skin as well as bumps on my arms from those ingrown hairs. I figured that I need to exfoliate more and I use this after product after using &amp;#34;Tree Hut Shea Sugar Body Scrub&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;•I really love the large sized salts, they really do feel great on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;•I like the oil in this product as it makes my more hydrated but I don&#x27;t feel oily and greasy afterwards. I use a towel to dry after my shower.&lt;br /&gt;•The amount in this jar should last you at least 1-2 months showering everyday and using this product all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;•I do not really care for the smell of this product. It is a little overwhelming and kind of reminds me of canned pineapple scent. It doesn&#x27;t smell GROSS it just is a little overwhelming is all. (It&#x27;s not so bad that I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this again though).&lt;br /&gt;•As much as I do like the oil in this product, I also dislike it. I wish it was just a tad bit less oily.&lt;br /&gt;•I do not really like the consistency of this product. I feel like I am shoveling rocks out of water when I get some out of the jar. There is not really a gel like consistency to it to hold the sea salt together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I do like this product and would purchase it again. I am still deciding if it is really worth almost $10 though.</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t like how greasy this product makes me feel afterwards. I rarely use it, and it&#x27;s not convenient to use</li>
    <li> I tried this at a friend&#x27;s house and loved the divine citrusy scent.  It such a treat to use.  It is an oil base though so makes the floor of the bathtub slippery.  I poured some oil out so it is mostly the salts now.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great, and works great, too. I used a different brand before that I also liked, but  this one smells nicer. Definitely clean out the tub when you&#x27;re done as it&#x27;s slick.</li>
    <li> kinda oily... wasnt what i expected but it was okay</li>
    <li> It makes my body feel smooth &amp; smells amazing. I follow it with the oil and feel soft &amp; lovely all day.</li>
    <li> My favorite &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; scrub that I always come back to...I have purchased high end and low end items that are similar yet none compare to the quality of this product - highly recommend!  I am a beauty junkie!</li>
    <li> Love smile good and makes my skin nice and smooth</li>
    <li> This stuff is just so greasy.  I used it in the shower and it got the shower floor all slippery.  Too oily for me.</li>
    <li> This scrub smells amazing, very citrusy and makes your skin very soft. The only problem I have is the layer of oil it has on top when you open it. I was unaware of this and it spilled on my shirt and on my bra underneath. I dumped the excess oil in the sink but had to rinse it out because it left a greasy film on it. Other than that, it was great.</li>
    <li> i was excited to try this scrub however when i received it the mixture was all the oil at top and the grains at bottom. needless to say i have to shake it each time and i feel like there is too much oil in it.  it does leave my skin soft and does scrub but is quite hard to get out properly from the jar. the consistency of the product inside needs to be updated.</li>
    <li> This smells SO good and leaves your skin really soft.  It exfoliates, oils, and softens.  I love it and will buy again!</li>
    <li> I do like the product very much but I really wish they had a type of sponge that you could apply it with. I know that there needs to be oils with the salts to be applied, so that so my only problem with the scrub. Using your fingers and hands is a waste I will find the right sponge. But after using the salts scrub you feel fresh&lt;br /&gt;and like a ton of dead skin fell off you. :)</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t find this product very useful. I needed a replacement to my discontinued Sugar Scrub, so i figured I&#x27;d give this scrub a try. It made my skin a bit slimy in the shower, and it didn&#x27;t feel fully clean for about a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But to be fair--It might not be the brand of scrub itself, it may be that i dislike Sea Salt scrubs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, i recommend a grainy Sugar Scrub instead. They get the job done,and they smell great!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product.  I have three teen girls, and I was looking for a cheaper alternative to the \\&quot;twice the cost and half the amount\\&quot; brand.  I purchased this to see if I and my girls would like it. We live in the desert, so we need a product like this one, or we do the daily lotion bath. We love it! At first, I did use too much; thinking it was like the other brand. With this product, a little bit goes a long way. Those who say it is too heavy, may have used too much. Also we like the larger salt grains, and yes the fragrance it fantastic!</li>
    <li> Makes skin soft and supple.  I have used products three times this price and this works better.&lt;br /&gt;Love the smell of citrus and my skin is soft for days.&lt;br /&gt;Will def buy and use again</li>
    <li> This makes my skin feel well hydrated without feeling oily &amp; it smells good too.  I recommend any Alba products.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t care for this at all. It&#x27;s one of those oily type of body scrubs that has to be stirred every time you use it. It&#x27;s pretty scrubby, which I like, but doesn&#x27;t seem to be very moisturizing for as oily as it is. I don&#x27;t like the overly oily non emulsified scrubs like this because they are \\&quot;messy\\&quot;, and although it did seem to exfoliate fairly well, it didn&#x27;t help my dry hands very much at all. Won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after purchasing a similar product from one of the brands that you have \\&quot;parties at homes for\\&quot; that was up near $30. This product works just as great, smells awesome, and I&#x27;m pleasantly pleased. TOTALLY a good BANG FOR YOUR BUCK!</li>
    <li> GREAT SCENT. FEEL OF AN EXFOLIANT. SKIN IS REFRESHED AND SOFT TO THE TOUCH.&lt;br /&gt;OWN SENSE OF SMELL IS DELIGHTED.</li>
    <li> This body scrub smells very tropical and leaves the skin with a thin coating of oil....perfect in the winter because you don&#x27;t need to lotion over after a shower.  Before using, make sure you stir it up well to combine the salt and oils.  I use it at the end of my shower and put a towel down on the shower floor before scrubbing because if you don&#x27;t, you get a very slippery shower/tub floor.  Don&#x27;t use it on any area that might be tender or if you have any scratch or redness as the salt will make it very irritated and burn.  The scrub is OK but not great...I personally like the Body Shop Olive Oil scrub better.  Would not purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> It is very greasy, more than other scrubs that I&#x27;ve used. Scent is ok but it just is too oily feeling for me.</li>
    <li> While I like the smell this one seems to &amp;#34;melt away&amp;#34; very quickly while scrubbing (I turn the shower off while using body scrub), I feel like I have to use too much for one shower.  It does leave a somewhat oily residue on your skin (which I like) but some on the shower floor (which again is fine since I like the feel of of my skin when used) so you will want to wipe it up before the next person gets in so they don&#x27;t fall.</li>
    <li> I stay dehydrated because I inhale coffee and monsters and wash my hands like there&#x27;s a plague going around. My skin cracks and bleeds in the winter and at 32 I normally look like I have the hands of a 50 yr old smoker. Yep, that bad. I&#x27;m nervous even when not consuming caffeine and often bite my nails and have self-inflicted injuries on my fingertips often. Because this has salt, any open wounds will burn, but it does seen to help them heal faster. More importantly, this exfoliates that dead dull outer layer of skin and leaves your skin feeling hydrated. Be sure to not soap after this or you&#x27;ll wash off the great oil/hydration. Oat dry. You may feel a little oily after your shower but it soaks in super fast and my skin looks better than it did in my 20s.</li>
    <li> I love sale scrub and this one is really nice.  Smells great and leaves you feeling like a babies bottom.</li>
    <li> I like it not love it. not sure if its like all sugar scrubs- kind of leaves a little bit of a film when washed off... but the smell is great and it does feel pretty good when you rub it on your legs....</li>
    <li> This product is amazing your skin is incredibly soft and the aroma is fabulous I highly recommend this product it compares to Fresh products which is considerably more expensive a five star in my book.</li>
    <li> Loving this Hawaiian body scrub sea salt by Alba Botanica!  A definite &#x27;must have&#x27; for anyone looking to promote healthier skin.  I&#x27;m looking forward to using this with other therapeutic recipes as well as cellulite...works like a charm and visible results in less than a week!  Love it!</li>
    <li> Smells great! Good stuff. Had found a great price on this order on Amazon. I use before shaving. Beware: It&#x27;s super oily so be careful in the shower regarding slipping and once opened the container doesn&#x27;t travel well. Even put tape around it and the oil leaked out over other stuff. But all the oil is GREAT for dry skin.</li>
    <li> Good product, but nothing too much difference with other similar products. I like the smell through. The skin feels smooth after using it.</li>
    <li> This seems like some excellent body scrub, but after I removed the sealed top, I put the lid back on, and now I can&#x27;t get it off. The scrub is super oily which leaks out of the container and makes it impossible to open. I have tried everything and am now stuck with a jar of good-smelling salts that I can&#x27;t actually use.</li>
    <li> This is the best body scrub ever. It smells so good and leaves my skin feeling soft for days.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. works great on feet! Smells great too. Great body scrub. really exfoliates. Was a gift from a friend but now I buy it</li>
    <li> Ok..after reading other reviews I bought this. 1) it DOES smell amazing.  2) yes be careful opening.  There&#x27;s a lot of oil on top, but I used a plastic fork to GENTLY mix it.  3) it didn&#x27;t leave a huge oil slick in my tub. I scooped a bit onto my fingers. I didn&#x27;t dump oil out.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely made my skin smooth.  I did need to wash my hands with soap or a drop of shampoo before rinsing my hair so as not to redeposit oil into my hair. I am very happy with this purchase!  And no, it&#x27;s not a face scrub. Too harsh. Great for legs&amp; armpits before shaving. And awesome for my dry nasty elbows.</li>
    <li> I like it, but the lid never tightens and the oil leaks out.</li>
    <li> There is a nice scent, a great scrub consistency and if it ended there I would be pleased but it is incredibly greasy. It&#x27;s truly like putting cooking oil on your body. I even use soap afterward but look and feel greasy all day. I can&#x27;t seem to cut through the greasy film. Watch your footing in the shower too. Very slippery. There must be something better.</li>
    <li> smells good too. I use this in conjunction with the kikui nut Hawaiian body oil and it makes me smell good enough to eat lol.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a sea salt scrub before so I can&#x27;t compare it to anything else, but I loved it.  The smell is great and it makes your skin really smooth.  I will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> This scrub has lots of oil.  I&#x27;ve used the salt scrub from Origins for a long time but was looking for something less expensive.  This is close.  The salt is nicer in the Origins product, more abrasive, but this is very nice.  And it smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> I love body scrubs and this is the one I use on a daily basis. Skin feels awesome and lasts all day. The orange scent is extremely strong at first but settles down through out the day. Scent does last all day though!</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff. It smells very good and has a nice thick texture. I like Alba products in general.</li>
    <li> oilier than I expected</li>
    <li> I have spent the night looking for and researching non toxic body scrubs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;using my go to website...  [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;started researching body scrubs and this was the best \\&quot;Alba Botanica\\&quot; body scrub product with a 1 out of 10 score on the toxic health concern scale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I am buying this today.  the reviews for it are good and I know that what i will test on my skin is safe and non toxic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;worth a try if you ask me.  here is what i found&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;j</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a body scrub before but it had a nice fragrance and seemed to work well. My only complaint is the oily residue it left on the floor of the shower. Sounds gross I know but it was definitely slippery afterwards. I would say it is a good scrub overall, the granules were a little big but it felt good and smelled nice.</li>
    <li> I was not too crazy about this.  It is slightly greasy and the sale grains are large which I don&#x27;t like on my skin.</li>
    <li> I loved this stuff. It smelled great. The salt wasn&#x27;t so harsh that it burned if there was a tiny cut from shaving. And, the oil wasn&#x27;t over powering to the point of making me feel like I was a buttered turkey. It was just the right balance. I&#x27;ll probably order another jar since summer is here! :)</li>
    <li> I use this on my entire body, face included. My skin has been dry due to winter and wind and heaters..this hit the spot!</li>
    <li> This was a disappointment to me.  I was excited to receive this body scrub to find that when I opened the jar, 1/4 of the oil sitting on the top just spilled all over me.  I closed the jar, shook up the contents and then proceeded to the shower.  The scent was nice, and the first experience with it was like digging in wet mud.  The salt was coarse and a rather uncomfortable to rub on my skin.  My result was very oily skin out of the shower, and not great moisturized skin later in the day.  My second attempt to use this product...I shook it up and when I opened the jar, I was pretty much left with slightly denser oily salt that was highly uncomfortable  to rub on my skin.  It was like using coarse sea salt and a little oil.  I eventually ended up mixing in my usual moisturizing body wash, which made the experience tolerable.  The third time I opened the jar, it was 80% salt.  Very sorry that I purchased 3 jars!!</li>
    <li> First off: I bought this product from my local health store, not on Amazon. But I feel I have to give my review here so that people are more informed about the kind of product this is. I like Alba Botanica&#x27;s products a lot, especially their body butters (simply the best). However, this body scrub is impossible for normal use. I don&#x27;t know if the consistency of this scrub is supposed to be an extremely harsh and large granules of salt in a terribly greasy oil, or it is perhaps some expired and improperly mixed-up ingredients resulting in this weird \\&quot;concoction\\&quot;. First off, the salt granules are so large and harsh that if you scrub your body too hard, you will scratch your skin. Secondly, the water/oil in which the salt granules are soaked is ... well, so extremely oily and after you rinse your body with water, there is a thick slimy film left all over your body. After rinsing my body with water, I washed my body again - twice - with regular soap to get rid of the oil residue, and it still did not wash off. Thirdly, I had to scrub my shower and bathtub with bleach to clean the terrible oil residue left over the entire bathtub area. I dumped the entire container in the garbage can after first use. I&#x27;m sorry Alba Botanica - I know your products are great and way healthier than most other commercial brands, but this scrub doesn&#x27;t look and feel anything like a body scrub.</li>
    <li> my body loves the smell and the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
    <li> After I used it for the second time I had a very hard time getting the lid off.  I see someone else complained of that as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is very oily which I do enjoy in the winter as my skin gets dry.  8 Hours later I still feel on my arms slight oily moisture which isn&#x27;t a bad thing at all if you enjoy oils on your skin (which I do).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is salt and not a sugar scrub if that makes a difference to anyone and the are larger granules.  The smell is enjoyable but not a yummy I want to eat it up type of a smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do have to stir it as the oil comes to the top so make note if you don&#x27;t enjoy doing that.  I find with all oil based scrubs this is pretty typical.  I will probably purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I really like this body scrub.  Leaves my skin feeling soft.  Especially feels so good on my feet.  Would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Best scrub I have ever tried!</li>
    <li> I am a smell person. If it smells good I will use it just on that principle alone. Not only does it smell fantastic but it leaves my legs, arms, and tummy smooth and very moisturized. A great salt scrub!</li>
    <li> I thought it would have that delicious, nutty smell like the Hawaiian Body Cream but it has a citrus smell - not my thing.</li>
    <li> I am a true fan of body scrubs, but finding the right combination of amount of oil, grit of scrub, and lasting scent.  This combines all... it&#x27;s a great buy.</li>
    <li> I loved the smell but it was so oily. Not as much of a fan as I thought i would be.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize this salt scrub would have so much oil.  Really only useful for legs/feet, etc.  not appropriate for hands b/c of the oily base.&lt;br /&gt;it has a nice fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;overall, it&#x27;s ok - not what I was looking for.</li>
</ol>
