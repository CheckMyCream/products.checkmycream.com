<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have bough two similar Retonal 2.5% products, another one is also a 2.5% by Advanced Skin Care and used each one on half of my face so far for one week and haven&#x27;t seen any changes nor felt any sensation. compare with the different product with 1% Retonal which I used before, within few days I could see it was working and it caused to shed the dry patches from the surface of my face. So comparing these two with the one I used before ( with much lower%) this product hasn&#x27;t done anything after one week of everyday used</li>
    <li> It is such a cute case....holds my phone perfectly tight.........and my credit cards...love it!!! I only had it for a week...so we will c if it doesn&#x27;t fall apart in do time.</li>
    <li> Texture was like water, tried to see a difference but really didn&#x27;t do much</li>
    <li> I had such high hopes for this product because it seems everyone had such a positive experience with it. I waited a month before I wrote a review so I could give a thorough and accurate account of my experience but I just didn&#x27;t have any results to publish. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because I had a bad batch maybe (?) or if this product just didn&#x27;t work for me. I&#x27;m so disappointed.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of Azure Naturals serum at first, but I ordered it with their money-back guarantee in mind, thinking … hey, if I don’t like it, I’ll return it, but at least I’ll have tried it and know whether or not it actually lives up to its claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I ordered the serum on October 10. I have been using it now for about 10 days, and already I have noted a remarkable difference in my skin. It’s no longer flaky in the areas that once were annoyingly dry and flaky, and in addition, it’s smoother, my pores are smaller, my skin is brighter, the darker circles under my eyes are fading in color, and the areas of my face prone to redness from mild rosacea, are lightening and losing some of their redness. This stuff is a miracle! I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is small, but every night before bed I use two pumps and it’s plenty for my face and neck, so I can see a bottle lasting for about a month. It dries quickly without any greasiness or noted dryness. Once it’s dry I follow with my moisturizer, and each time I do, I wake up with more vibrant, younger looking skin. It’s just that good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you’re hesitant about using this product, or choose to believe the negative reviews, that’s unfortunate, as this serum works! If you want more youthful skin, give this a try. I think you’ll be pleasantly surprised. I’ll be a customer for life.</li>
    <li> I only received the large bottle, but I really like it, can tell a difference in less than a week, I thought it would be two bottles with the order.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think there is real retinol in this.</li>
    <li> Cant see that much of a change, not going to send it back though</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really notice any difference after using this. Likely won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> Too soon to know if it&#x27;s working to reduct wrinkles.  However it is ok to use under my eyes and on sensative parts of my skin.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a great product, I will continue using and buying it again.</li>
    <li> I expected to feel a tingle when I used this and to see some results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it for a couple of months now and see nothing changed...never got a tingle, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was wondering if I&#x27;d gotten an old bottle until I saw all of the 1-star reviews saying the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> This serum is pretty good, i recieved this product free, and they gave me the option to review this product. I think it works pretty well, i dont have alot of wrinkles, but i do have some fine lines. It tingles a tiny bit and theres a slight burning sensation when you rub it in, but i have VERY sensitive skin, so that just might be for me. I used it for a week to track the results so i could honestly review this product, and every time i used it for a while afterwards my face would feel just a bit tighter. My face looks a lot less worn after a week of using this product, and my skin is glowing. I like it but it smells weird, thats my only problem with it, and the burning sensation.&lt;br /&gt;For the price, if you are looking to try a new wrinkle serum, go ahead and try this one.</li>
    <li> Lost my mony &amp; not mony back</li>
    <li> Have not noticed a difference in my skin.  I have used rx retinol and you go through the uglies but you get results after a few months.  This may assist w/cell turnover but so does a good vitamin c serum used daily.</li>
    <li> I was SO happy to find a product for nighttime that met all of my needs: safe for acne-prone but mid-30s skin (so showing some signs of age); *cruelty free*; no parabens or other garbage, AND affordable!!  I&#x27;ve definitely seen an improvement in my skin since using this product. I use it every other night, and use Azure&#x27;s Hyaluronic acid serum on off nights. My skin looks less tired, as other reviewers have said, more &amp;#34;radiant&amp;#34;. It also hasn&#x27;t made me break out when many products do, and I don&#x27;t find it too drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the pump, which squirts out too much. However, I love Azure&#x27;s products and will be buying them again and again!</li>
    <li> I did not notice a difference in my skin after 2 months of use. I am 29 years-old and was hoping to improve my skin tone and texture...&lt;br /&gt;This did not help.  I would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Vitamin A and C help boost collagen production and increase elastin in our skin, which makes skin tighter and more firm. Retinal serum penetrates deep into skin, and assists this production. Applying this serum nightly will increase your skin&#x27;s moisture and cellular renewal. I like to use a dead sea salt or sugar and honey facial scrub about 1-2 times a week for a natural microdermabrasion and exfoliation. I like applying Retinal, along with Vitamin C and Hyaluronic acid after my facial buffing. It is advised to apply serums before Retin-A or Retinol, and then apply moisturizer last.</li>
    <li> I use these products every night. I love them! They are convenient to use, and make me feel optimistic about the future of my skin :-). Good price too!</li>
    <li> So far so good, may be to early to tell.</li>
    <li> ****Update 1/31/15****&lt;br /&gt;I still use this frequently and continue to see results. The one thing I forgot to mention is that Retinol should only be used at NIGHT. UV breaks it down, making it ineffective and leaves your skin more susceptible to UV damage. This is also why it comes in a tinted bottle. I&#x27;m wondering if the people who have given this a bad review understand this or not. If you use it during the day you&#x27;re not going to get the results you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still completely stand behind the effectiveness of this product. It also does not need to be used every single night. I use it about 4 nights out of the week and not always consecutively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re using it during the day, stop. Only use it before bed and you should see results.&lt;br /&gt;*********&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 31 and since turning 30 my skin has been noticeably less taught and fine lines are popping up all over the place. I wish I had bought this product a long time ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product. In just a few days of use my skin looks amazing and I can already tell a dramatic difference in the fine lines around my mouth, the expression lines in my forehead, and the fine lines around my my eyes. No joke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this in conjunction with unrefined organic Marajuca Oil (applied 15 mins after this serum) and my skin hasn&#x27;t felt this hydrated and smooth in years. My makeup is even applying better and looking better. I feel like my foundations and concealer are blending into my skin better and not just sitting on top looking cakey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum is really light, almost gel like in consistency, and absorbs into the skin effortlessly. It doesn&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;ve got anything on your skin afterward either leaving no greasiness, and no &#x27;film&#x27; left on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that this bottle has a pump and not a dropper. It&#x27;s less messy and you have more control over the product as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use about three pumps total: two for my face and one for my neck. One full pump does not dispense a ton of the product either, so this bottle is going to last a good while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like that this serum has hyaluronic acid in it as well. I had been using a hyaluronic acid serum before ordering this and I hadn&#x27;t been noticing much an effect except that it seemed to be making my skin DRIER. I honestly wish I had found this serum first because now my skin can still benefit from the effects of hyaluronic acid in conjunction with Retinol. This serum also contains Vitamin E which I have been admittedly depriving my skin of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this serum if you&#x27;re in the market for an effective retinol product that will last awhile and not break the bank! I love it and don&#x27;t plan on being without it from here on out.tal: two for my face and one for my neck.

    <li> My high hopes for this product were not met. I used every drop in the bottle, first every other night, then each night before bed. I am 28 with some early aging signs on my face (sagging cheeks, dark circles under eyes), and sadly this serum gave me no improvement whatsoever. I still gave 2 stars for being a cosmetics company that does not conduct animal testing, but honestly I have my doubt&#x27;s about all those &amp;#34;unbiased&amp;#34; reviews written by people who received free samples (I paid for this).</li>
    <li> Used the whole bottle over the period of about 3 months. Absolutely no improvement on wrinkles. It feels nice. I contacted them for the refund and they told me to give more time, so I did until I finished the whole bottle and let them know there was still no improvement. They refunded me right away. It may work for you or may not, but at least no loss for you to try. This product did nothing for me, but they have great customer service.</li>
    <li> Yes this serum does work. At 62 years of age I would certainly notice a difference. Highly recommend this item.  Patricia</li>
    <li> Since I have sensitive skin I did a patch test with the Ultimate Retinol Serum on small spots on my cheeks.  That way if I did have a reaction it wouldn&#x27;t be too bad.  Per Azure Naturals detailed and thorough instructions: I applied the Ultimate Retinol Serum once a day every other day for 4 days. I saw no adverse affects and was ready to fully use my new skin care product.&lt;br /&gt;When I was ready to get going I applied a thin layer of the Retinol Serum.  I used it every other night for a week and then advanced to every night since I saw no negative affects and loved how it was working.&lt;br /&gt;Right off the bat I loved the feeling on my skin.  It&#x27;s nice and light while at the same time you can feel it there working.  I instantly had really soft and supple skin.  I was completely immersed in hydration.  My sun damaged skin absorbed the serum very nicely.  I didn&#x27;t have a sticky, heavy feeling either.  I am noticing diminishing of fine lines around my mouth and eyes and yes I&#x27;m able to apply by my eyes without any rashes, itching or anything.  I love it.  My skin hasn&#x27;t been this radiant in years.  I love that it&#x27;s actually affordable, works and is still gentle!.  That&#x27;s a triple win in my book!  I can&#x27;t wait to see more changes.  I have noticed a little softening in the small line in my forehead but it is still there.  The company says for dramatic affects it takes about 6-8 weeks.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for a little over 3 weeks but love all how well it&#x27;s working so far.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using it every day. My skin is looking great.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t perform as expected.</li>
    <li> Used it for several months and saw only alittle difference.  Was expecting more from the reviews I read.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I have been using it for almost a year and my skin has been totally transformed. The best!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t honestly think it accomplished anything at all  (?)</li>
    <li> I will just say that I&#x27;ve tried other retinal products that I&#x27;m much more impressed with</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple of weeks. It&#x27;s ok but I have not seen any results yet.</li>
    <li> start working on aging is a joke, but worth a try it seems to be helping</li>
    <li> This is a pump bottle way better than the dropper bottles that you end up wasting more than you need. I just used two small drops and my face is covered. So its worth it and will last along time. Feels great, fresh, and smooth not leaving it greasy. My skin isnt tight under my eyes like i would want it to be. I have used many different things and nothing seems to work and feel like this. It feels amazing. I wish I have seen this product a couple years ago.. I can even have my mom use it. She is gonna love it also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VITAMIN C WORKS! Our serum dramatically boosts the production of collagen, which increases your skin’s rate of cellular renewal. Improved cellular turnover refines your skin’s texture, while visibly plumping and firming your skin. With consistent use this will start to minimize fine lines and wrinkles.

This will fade age spots and dramatically improve discoloration leaving your skin with a youthful glow! All around loveeee this thank you for reading..;)</li>
    <li> This stuff was OK, but left my skin feeling really dry.</li>
    <li> I bought this about 4 weeks ago with Azure Natural&#x27;s Guaranteed Strongest Wrinkle Eraser 2.5% and 22% Vitamin C serums.  I use all three.  I start with Vitamin C, then the Cucumber and finish with the Retinol 2.5%.  My skin as improved so much!!!  I am 61 with dry, sensitive skin.  The dryness is much improved with no more flakes, texture is better, wrinkles are reducing due to improved hydration.  Great results at a fantastic value!</li>
    <li> This stuff works like charm. I&#x27;ve had a prescription retinoid before, but I like this stuff so much better. It doesn&#x27;t help with dark spots as quickly as the prescription, but it makes the skin heal up much faster like one, but with no redness or irritation. It doesn&#x27;t clog my pores, which are very fine and tight, and has a light refreshing scent. I especially love its watery gel texture. It feels cool and soothing and layers under anything beautifully. I use it right after washing my face while it&#x27;s still slightly damp or after toner the same way. It really does make my skin heal up faster from acne or picking. I start seeing results the very next morning - like reductions in redness or swelling. And every single time, within 2 days, everything&#x27;s practically healed up and starting to peel off - just like when I used the prescription. After that everything is smooth and soft. I use it every single night, and sometimes even in the morning if I&#x27;m not going out. That really speeds up things even more! It makes my delicate skin veeeery happy, healthy, and soft. I&#x27;m in love.</li>
    <li> Love this! I use this with a vitamin C serum and my wrinkles (while still there) are majorly reduced! My skin somehow looks plumper and refreshed. Love this!!!</li>
    <li> Good product and send time</li>
    <li> When used with the OZ retinol moisturizing cream, is incredible</li>
    <li> This Product didn&#x27;t do anything for me. I don&#x27;t see any changes.</li>
    <li> makes my skin feel really smooth and soft</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how good it will work. Too soon to say</li>
    <li> This gives my skin a nice smooth texture.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to penetrate into the skin, it&#x27;s working fine on my face.</li>
    <li> The Retinol does help reduce fine lines and wrinkles. However I have very sensitive skin and noticed a little redness after using consistently for a few days. I try to avoid products with synthetic fillers such as carageenen gum, polysorbates and sodium benzoates because they irritate my skin. If you have super sensitive skin I would advise avoiding this product. After applying the serum my skin felt like it had a thin layer of plastic on it. I applied moisturizer afterwards but it didn&#x27;t help much. I felt like I wanted to wash my face again. Since stopping use of this product the redness and flushing has gone away and I have my soft skin back.</li>
    <li> Can see no difference, skin still dry.  Bought a dermatologist&#x27;s formula which is much better--more $</li>
    <li> I was expecting some irritation and peeling but my skin didn&#x27;t seem bothered by this product at all. I am not a newby with these types of products though so if this isn&#x27;t your first rodeo then you&#x27;ll need something with bigger guns for bigger results.</li>
    <li> This will smooth out the skin under your eyes. I had fine lines and when I was using this it made the lines less noticeable.</li>
    <li> Ingredients: Organic Herbal Infusion, Organic Aloe, Botanical Hyaluronic Acid, Pentylene Glycol, Phospholipids, Retinol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Carrageenan Gum, Organic Jojoba Oil, Triticum Vulgare, Vitamin E, Organic Green Tea, Wildcrafted Resina Propoli, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin in an amber glass bottle with a dispensing pump. Made in the USA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Product: The product is a milky gel. Two pumps is enough to cover the face. The gel seems to melt into a liquid form and spreads easily over the face. It also absorbs quickly and fully. I really loved that this serum has basically no scent. It won&#x27;t interfere with perfumes or other scents. The amber bottle and well sealed pump protect the product from oxidation and other environmental contaminants. Upon applying the serum I immediately got a cooling, then firming sensation. It felt very soothing on my skin and immediately loosened the tightness and removed the dryness that had been present. This product can be layered with other serums, liquids and creams to enhance and reinforce the benefits. Or it can be used alone. The retinol penetrates the skin. I like to think of it as a wakeup to the skin. Then the other ingredients, such as the Hyaluronic Acid, hold and retain moisture, which increases the softness and smoothness. This remains until it is cleansed. Even after cleansing the face, the skin feels much smoother and softer. I continued to use this serum and it kept my skin feeling great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product mentioned above for free to test and review. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> I waited until I&#x27;d used up the entire (large) bottle before writing a review, to give it a fair chance. Unfortunately, over the six-ish months I used it almost every night, I noticed absolutely NO difference in my skin in any way. I&#x27;m 44, with a few small wrinkles (not deep), and horribly puffy undereye areas Normal, clear, slightly dry skin. After reading a hundred reviews, I was so hopeful this would make me look at least a tiny bit younger. But nope. Nada. Weirdly, I almost wonder if I got some sort of &#x27;scam&#x27; bottle...at 2.5% retinol, it definitely should have burned a bit or irritated my skin at first, the way other retinol products I&#x27;ve tried have. This was indiscernible from slightly viscous water.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to go back to the Skinceuticals brand retinol I used a couple years ago...it&#x27;s more expensive, and I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference with that, but at least I could tell there was something besides water in it...</li>
    <li> My wrinkles didn&#x27;t go anywhere</li>
    <li> love this stuff.  I have always looked younger than what I am.  But, after using Azure, I could see a difference.</li>
    <li> I’ve been experimenting with different types of Vitamin C and Hyaluronic Acid Serums to try to find out which one I like best. Dr Oz has raved about the anti-aging benefits of of Vitamin C and E on the skin and these Serums have become all the rage. I received a 1oz bottle of Azure Naturals with  2.5% Retinol + 10% Hyaluronic Acid + Vitamin E + Organic Green Tea + Organic Aloe &amp; Jojoba Oil to review. As I have mentioned before while reviewing other anti-aging products, I am not one to jump on the anti-ageing hype but I do want to take care of my skin the best that I can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Organic Herbal Infusion, Organic Aloe, Botanical Hyaluronic Acid, Witch Hazel, Pentylene Glycol, Phospholipids, Retinol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Carrageenan Gum, Organic Jojoba Oil, Triticum Vulgare, Vitamin E (Tocopheryl Acetate), Organic Green Tea, Wildcrafted Resina Propoli, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions: After cleansing, exfoliating, toning, and serum application, apply moisturizer generously to the skin; allow to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Serum has a consistency of a thick aloe and has a pleasant herbal/citrus smell, it goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly into the skin. The product is in dark brown bottle with an airless pump lid (the photos on Amazon showed an eyedropper).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review.&lt;br /&gt;Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> Since I have only used it for a month it is hard to give a complete review.</li>
    <li> Pleased with the product so far ... and the results are as told...I&#x27;ve only been using for a couple of weeks so I look forward to seeing the results after 4 weeks! So far...so good!</li>
    <li> I have been using this since October once a day. I wanted to really use this product to give a honest evaluation, the verdict is that I noticed my pores are significantly smaller. I use this product along with the Azure Naturals  22% Vitamin C Serum that I apply morning &amp; night. My dark spots seems like they have lightened, they still are there. This is from 2 months of doing this regime.</li>
    <li> Key is to not give up. Keep using product and get results. You will be happy with the end results.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with this, I did not notice any difference what so ever . I have found other products by Sublime which work much better.</li>
    <li> I have repurchased this 1oz  product twice now so am happy to have access to 2oz on Prime. Using with the Azure 22% vitamin C on my arms and legs with great results smoothing and retexturing skin. Great products!</li>
    <li> Actually works for fine lines after just a few weeks.  I was very impressed.</li>
    <li> I ordered the full line - for morning I use the Vitamin C toner, Vitamin C serum and Vitamin C moisturizer, plus the cucumber eye. in the evening I use the Vitamin C toner, Retinol serum and Retinol moisturizer plus the cucumber eye. I also purchased the Vitamin C cleanser but I haven&#x27;t been using it yet as I finish up another cleanser. there were a few minor blemishes at first as my skin got used to the new products. I can say after a couple of weeks there is NOTICEABLE difference in sun-related pigmentation/discoloration and a rough patch of skin that formed on my cheek a few months ago (and didn&#x27;t go away with any other skin products is now completely gone. I use a Clarisonic daily. there&#x27;s been no issue with irritation or dryness. My skin feels very soft and makeup goes on beautifully. My forehead lines appear to be smoothing out and my eye crinkles do as well. for the affordable price I am REALLY IMPRESSED. I will keep ordering.</li>
    <li> Very sensitive, oily, acne prone skin. This product irritated my skin and gave me a lot of acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Might not be a reflection of the product, but of my skins reaction to retinal. Just wanted to let others with similar issues be aware.</li>
    <li> I love it!  Use this every night... I can instantly see my skin get smoother.... It feels so soft.</li>
    <li> I have a light skin tone, and sometimes suffer from redness. It is something that runs in my family, and something I am always trying to cover up. Since starting to use this, I have noticed that the redness in my face is starting to become less visible. I am still in the process of using this, and I believe that if I keep up with my routine, the results will keep improving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 2nd change that I have noticed, is the firmness in my skin. My face almost has a plumper feel to in, and I have that youthful look. I am only in my mid-twenties, but I have noticed areas that aren&#x27;t as firm as they once were. I tend to double up use on those areas, and I have noticed the results when applying my makeup. My skin just looks better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t tried a retinol anti wrinkle serum before, then this one by Azure Naturals is one that I recommend giving a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
    <li> Retinol, Hyaluronic Aci, Vitamin E, Organic Green Tea, Organic Aloe and Jojoba Oil - these are but some of the topnotch ingredients that Azure Naturals incorporated in this serum that I have been loving so much lately! I am in my mid thirties and believe that prevention is better than cure - and that goes for my skin too. I have been meticulous about using great anti aging serums to prevent or maybe slow down the formation of deep lines and wrinkles on my skin. So far, my routine has been working and I am quite satisfied. Azure Natural has been one of the brands that I have been loving for quite some time now. Their Anti Aging formulas have worked so well for me and this Wrinkle Eraser is no different! It has delivered the results that it promised to do and it has been working wonderfully on my skin - specially the lines on the sides of my nose!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I refuse to review or endorse products that I have not or will not personally try. Needless to say, I may be a product reviewer but my thoughts are real and none of the things I say on my reviews are made up or fake - they are all based on my experience/s with whatever product I am reviewing. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
    <li> I used this product religiously only to find out it didn&#x27;t work. Item is sold as guaranteed but when you try to go to returns it is no longer eligible.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> *I was given this complimentary to give my honest opinion *&lt;br /&gt;I love how smooth this is ! Better yet it goes great with my other Azul products. I had fine lines around my lips and eyes and with in a week I seen a huge difference!  I love it an recommend it to everyone</li>
    <li> I love this product I received it for my unbiased and honest opinion review I believe that this has made a difference and have only used it for about 2 weeks I have to say the shipping was great and the product packaging was wonderful as well</li>
    <li> First I must disclose that I have been provided this product to test with the understanding that I will write a product review that is accurate and completely honest.&lt;br /&gt;I started using this as directed every other night for two weeks, then after 2 weeks I started applying it every night - that was a week ago.&lt;br /&gt;I never had any unpleasant sensation or reaction. It is cool and refreshing from the moment I put it on and stays that way until long after I fall asleep - a very pleasant experience.&lt;br /&gt;Even though it has only been a short time, my “smile” lines on the outer edges of my eyes and cheek bones seem to be less severe. I think I will need more time to get the results one might expect from this, but I did notice a change so I am encouraged to continue.&lt;br /&gt;A couple of things I can say about the  Serum (and Azure products I’ve tried) so far is that (1) it is an affordable choice in a sea of very expensive competitors and (2) it feels really good and amazingly refreshing on the skin for quite some time after applying it - so good in fact that I look forward to doing it for that reason alone.</li>
    <li> love it, would reccomend it to otheres</li>
    <li> I was not given this product, I actually bought it and will tell you how I feel about it &#x3D;) This is a very nice serum, goes on smooth and absorbs almost instantly. I didn&#x27;t notice any smell either, which was nice. I have noticed that it clears up blemishes faster also which was a pleasant surprise. I am in my late twenties doing the whole preventive thing so I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s helped with existing wrinkles, will hopefully prevent them! Overall I am enjoying this serum and would recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is a product I would rate as okay but I really didn&#x27;t see a change in my skin. It wasn&#x27;t harsh like some retinol products that why I doubt it had 2.5% retinol in it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum nightly for the last 3 months, and it hasn&#x27;t reduced my wrinkles at all. It seemed to lighten my sun spots on my forehead a little, but they are still noticeable. I&#x27;ll be searching for a different brand.</li>
    <li> I bought the wrinkle eraser 2.5% retinol I have fine line wrinkles I&#x27;m 55 years old still young I would say anyway I have some more on my for head I&#x27;ve tried everything from hundreds of dollars they worked somewhat but I was look on Amazon came across this wrinkle eraser and I am so pleased with it iv been useing it now for two week&#x27;s I can all ready see a difference my face is smoother the wrinkles I can&#x27;t see maybe a little bit I just look brighter and it won&#x27;t clog your pors big one I&#x27;m staying with this product I love it it works and they garintee it for a year or more I wanted you lady&#x27;s to no if you were wondering about this it dose work I highly recommend it thank you</li>
    <li> I have noticed less lines and wrinkles around  my eyes.  I recommend  this product.</li>
    <li> I like it well enough to continue to use and order it. I guess it is working. It does seem to tighten my skin. Mimi T.</li>
    <li> As a member of a fabulous website that brings companies, products and reviewers together,  I was provided with a free full size product to use and then honestly review. So I integrated the Azure Naturals Ultimate Retinol Anti Wrinkle Serum into my evening beauty routine. I had not been using an evening retinol or serum of any sort so I was excited to see how well this would work on my face. I was a smoker for 20 years, quit in 2006 and haven&#x27;t had one since! But the fine lines around my lips and mouth constantly remind me of how damaging smoking was to me. I was sure that I would just have to live with the visual evidence of my misspent youth. LOL    So for the fist three evenings, I cleansed my face before going to bed, used my toner then applied this retinol product, moisturizerized and went to bed. The third morning, I woke up to flaky, dry skin and I panicked a little. So I reread the product info and learned that it was probably wiser to ease up on the amount of serum and to do it only every other night until my skin got used to the strength of the serum.    I did just that and now, I no longer wake up with flaky skin. In fact, I see reflected in the mirror, a significant reduction in those fine lines are my mouth! I&#x27;m hoping that with consistent use, the lines on my forehead will diminish as well! I love that this serum is made in the USA, that it is cruelty free and not tested on animals, is 97% natural and 72% organic! Definitely worth using...just remember to ease into itsit and MOISTURIZE!!!</li>
    <li> No difference after using a bottle.</li>
    <li> It didnt do much for me. In the time that i was using it my skin had barley changed at all. My acne was still there, no improvement on wrinkles, pores were the same.  The smell of the product is really bad to, like bad milk. There are much better products out there  I was sent this product to reviwe by www.ilovetoreview.com</li>
    <li> I like the combination  of Retinol + Hyaluronic Acid + Vitamin E + Organic Green Tea + Organic Aloe &amp; Jojoba Oil. Goes on smooth and soaks in quickly</li>
    <li> This serum may be effective but the smell is not appealing at all. I can&#x27;t even use it. I purchased some from a competitor and the smell is so much better.</li>
    <li> i got this product for free and so far so good , like my wife is using it in the day and before she go to the bed at night and this AzureNaturals is an ultimate retinol that is anti-wrinkle serum ,and so far she likes it alot ,like she just new immigrate here in the US and she came from in the Phillipines which is really different temperature that shes experiencing a dryness from her skin,but she said she loves this product for her face which it contains also a 2.5% retinol and hyaluronic acid and specially a Vitamin E that she needed , and it smells good too..</li>
    <li> What I like most about this product is the pump at the top of the bottle. A lot of bottles this size have an eyedropper, but the pump delivers a nice small bit at a time. I have very sensitive skin and I always worry that the product will burn or turn my skin red. This product does not do that, it is pretty mild. It also has a very mild smell, which is important to me. I was lucky enough to receive a sample of this product.</li>
    <li> Very worthy product, especially for mature skin.  Better than a few pricey one I have tried. Will purchase this one again.</li>
    <li> Nice natural product that isn&#x27;t drying or harsh.  I notice a reduction in the forehead lines we all look to diminish.  I love the fact that their products are made in the USA with all natural products.  I use their Ultimate Vitamin C and Cucumber peptide eye gel too.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a non-irritating Retinol serum give this a try.</li>
    <li> I will order this product again. It is as advertised and arrived in good condition on time.</li>
    <li> Great product. Shared with my mother.</li>
    <li> I really love all Azure Naturals products they really work! Highly recommend</li>
    <li> Did not see any results and there was darkening of my skin which should have been the opposite.</li>
    <li> I like that this is all natural and organic This serum doesn&#x27;t have a smell, scent, or tingling sensation when applied which can sometimes irritate my skin. I have seen a reduction in the fine line around my eyes, but it&#x27;s helped most with the &#x27;butt crack&#x27; in the middle of my forehead.  When I scowl or frown, it pops back to flat pretty quickly.  This product was provided to me for review purposes, opinion is my own.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying this every day and it&#x27;s been keeping my face smooth and supple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I got this for a reduced price for a product review and my opinions are 100% my own.)</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift and I am so happy that I did.  It&#x27;s an excellent product and smells good.  It applies smoothly and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.  I&#x27;ll purchase it when I run out!</li>
    <li> i absolutely  love Azure Natural  serum. i have purchased  around 3 different bottles. they all are amazing. this one is even better. its not smelly or sticky. it actually smells like Green tea and Aloe which are in thus serum. the product  does what it say. i have been using it for 2 weeks. mornings  and nights. i have noticed my pores less and less. your face feels beautifully soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received  this product for free or discount  for an honest  review as stated above</li>
    <li> It is recommended that you start using retinol in your late twenties or early thirties to combat fine lines before they become apparent. The company even includes specific directions on how to use it since new users will need to start with a small amount every other day and gradually increase their application as their skin adjusts.  I only used this product as part of my evening beauty ritual since retinol increases your sensitivity to the sun.  Application was really easy - a couple of pumps provided enough product to cover my face and neck, and I would usually distribute a little more to dab around my eyes.  It isn&#x27;t oily at all, and a moisturizer layers easily over it.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this for a couple of weeks so it&#x27;s hard to give a really good review of what it&#x27;s like but so far I really do like it.It comes in a pump bottle which I prefer as it&#x27;s easier to gauge how much you use at a time.I feel that using 2 pumps of it is enough to use on the areas of my face that need it.It&#x27;s not a thick gel so it&#x27;s very easy to apply and it doesn&#x27;t feel sticky in the slightest.I only use it every couple of days and I apply it at night before bed.I can certainly see and feel a difference in my skin,especially the round the eye area,it&#x27;s smoother and the lines aren&#x27;t as predominant as they were before I started .I can&#x27;t wait to see the difference after using this for a couple of months.</li>
    <li> I have been wanting a good anti wrinkle serum for awhile. I am in my 30&#x27;s now and would prefer to prevent them then deal with them later down the road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a coupon code and received the product free in just 2 days. The product was packaged well so it made it to my home without any problems. The bottle was a descent size with a nice little pump on top for easy dispensing. The serum was nice and thick so it coated well. I have been using it 2 times a day for a couple of weeks and I am already noticing a difference in the fine lines that I already do have. It leaves your skin feeling very soft and supple. I am really impressed with this product so far and will continue to use it. It is a must try!!!</li>
    <li> Received a few days ago. Already using the product daily. I love the way it feels so far!</li>
    <li> I gave this to my daughter since she needs because of sun damage.  She really likes this she could  wear it every night and no problems. Her skin has changed.  I love this brand myself I use the vitamin c serum and hyaluronic acid serum.  Always good service and fast delivery.</li>
    <li> This product felt like applying water to my skin. I kept using it anyway to see long term effects. After 2 weeks, my skin turned really bad. My light acne became severe so I stopped using the product and my skin got back to normal.I was hoping this product would erase some acne scars but it made the acne come back!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Ultimate Retinol Serum along with the Ultimate C Skin Repair Serum by Azure Naturals and have noticed a great improvement  in the skin around my eye area and even noticed more hydration in my skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Serum for about a week. Its pretty sticky but it did show improvement within a few days. For the price, I feel it&#x27;s actually a really good night cream.</li>
    <li> Love this it was awesome!! it worked for my mom really well..</li>
    <li> It is really good. I got a high discount code for purchase it. So I want to give it a try. After use it for several days, I feel my skin smoother than before.</li>
    <li> I really like this product, it made my skin look younger. It reduced the wrinkles I had. I have tried other products and have never had such quick results.</li>
    <li> I am a huge believer in Retinol and what it can do for fine lines.  Really helps them disappear from around my lips and eyes.  This product does 2 things for me works to erase the wrinkles and plumps up my skin.  I have been using this at night as directed in conjunction with their vitamin c product and use their ultimate hylauronic at during the day.  My skin has transformed as a result and I look 5 years younger.  Have been using their products for 4 months now.  If you can afford them all buy,buy,buy.  You will LOVE them.</li>
    <li> Product has not caused any reactions to my sensitive skin.  Looking forced to results in a couple of months.  I am hoping this helps my tired old face.  So far I like this product and will continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I have not received any compensation for writing this post.

    <li> I have been using this a few weeks now, and I have to say that of all the serums and creams I have used, this is the only one that gave fast and noticeable results to a few trouble areas on my face. I have a nasty crease in my forehead that I hate, and this really plumped up my skin and made it a lot less noticeable within 3 uses. I have used it day and night though for the time I have had it. I was sampling it to review, and I wanted to really give it a workout. I have had no irritation, no peeling and it has been incredible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have since noticed some lines disappear altogether, and a sun spot that I can&#x27;t even cover with concealer has started to fade. I am loving this product. I will be trying their vitamin c serum that is the day serum next week... love this product though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> My wife had some wrinkles beginning around her eyes. Azure Naturals has not only helped fade these wrinkles, but make my wife&#x27;s face look healthier and younger. You can tell this product gives your skin back the youthful health look. Her skin is smoother and softer. Using this with the vitamin C serum does wonders for the skin. This is an excellent product that actually works. My wife is loving all of these products from Azure. They are doing wonder for her skin.</li>
    <li> This stuff works! I started to notice fine lines around my mouth and I began using this serum at night after I washed my face. It absorbs very smoothly into the skin leaving your skin feeling moisturized without feeling greasy. It took over 2 weeks for me to see a difference but when I did it was pretty noticeable. I also suffer with dry patches around my mouth (where I can see lines starting to form also) and this serum eliminated this within a week. The only downside to this product is that it does have a noticeable smell...it&#x27;s not a bad smell but you can notice it when you apply it to your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLAIMER: I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW. MY OPINIONS OF THIS PRODUCT ARE BASED ON MY OWN HONEST AND UNBIASED EXPERIENCE USING THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> Only been using for a week but starting to see notice changes in my skin already.</li>
    <li> The bottle has a pump top, so you can use just as much as you need. This has almost a gel-like consistency, no strong scent, and my skin absorbs it like butta’. It doesn’t leave your skin shiny at all. It feels fabulous on its own, but obviously, you would want to wear this under moisturizer. I use this at night under my favorite “nighttime cream” at the moment. I’ve tried this on my regular and sensitive skin days and it’s been amazing. No issues whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don’t have any major aging issues with my skin, but experts recommend starting on an anti-aging regimen early on because it can really benefit you later in life. I read somewhere that your skin in your 40s is a reflection of what you did in your 20s and 30s and I like to live that way. My mom also likes this and she is the pickiest person on earth.</li>
    <li> I did not see any difference after using.</li>
    <li> A wonderful wrinkle eraser, my skin looks and feels great after only a month of use. As I head closer and closer to 40, my skin is starting to show the most minute cracks of aging and I am fighting it tooth and nail. Having received a bottle of this amazing Retinol to try, I can honestly say it is a wonderful formula and it works!! I look great.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, I&#x27;m extremely happy with it.</li>
    <li> Like this moisturizer very much. Smooths my ever aging skin..</li>
    <li> It is an excellent product changes in my skin look pretty good.</li>
    <li> I really have not seen an improvement with this product. I will keep using it in hopes of telling a difference. It has no smell &amp; feels like water. Maybe I got a bad bottle?</li>
    <li> WOW! And I mean WOW! Just two days of use and my lines are flat and almost gone! How is this possible? It smells good but not perfumey and just smooths things out? I remember when retinol first came out for acne treatment I am forth now but I was in 4th grade then. Some kid in our class had really bad acne for her age and she was using it. It really dried out her face. This is just smooth and soft and WOW.&lt;br /&gt;I have laughed and I had partied a lot in my life and this last year or two I stopped wearing makeup and turned forty.&lt;br /&gt;Recently I stepped up my game to get healthy and wear makeup again but my face had turned into a wrinkle fest!&lt;br /&gt;I had deep wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;I tried several expensive things and looked at top ten recommended lists and bought all consecutively to try them. Nothing really worked. You had to keep it on to keep things moist or the wrinkles were just horrid and then if you put makeup on them they popped back up!&lt;br /&gt;Not happening with this stuff. I read somewhere that 90% of the price you pay for big names is advertising.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff seems pure and so far its working. I will update you in a bit as to progress.&lt;br /&gt;So far two days WOW! So smooth and soft and levelled wrinkles out. As if my skin is young again?</li>
    <li> this serum it&#x27;s great, i apply at night after i wash my face, my face is nice and smooth and hydrated i like it works for me.</li>
    <li> Before sitting down to write my review of Azure Naturals ULTIMATE RETINOL Anti Wrinkle Serum I was browsing reviews online, like normal, to see what other customers thought. I like to see what other opinions are to see if they match-up with my thoughts. I was also a little worried because I’m lucky and don’t really have fine lines yet so I was trying to decide what type of comparison I could use to see if this product would really help rejuvenate my skin. Apparently the blogging gods were listening to me because the next day I woke up with a blemish and we aren’t talking just a little, barely noticeable blemish we are talking BOOM right there, everyone dose a double take, blemish. The type of blemish that normally takes forever to heal! I’m a lucky girl, I know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In some of the reviews online I saw that some customers recommended using the ULTIMATE RETINOL Anti Wrinkle Serum to repair and heal skin. BINGO! LIGHT BULB! I started using the serum and within a couple of days, the skies opened up, the angels sang, and my blemish healed and faded to the point that one could barely see it. I would say it works ladies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I know what you are thinking, I forgot to touch upon something important … the SMELL of the product! I performed my normal sniff test and shockingly it really didn’t have a smell. Although at first I thought this product would be oily, I found that it absorbs quickly into my skin like it wasn’t even there. Like other Azure Naturals products the serum left my skin feeling softer and smoother then when I started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the time being, I will continue to use this product for problem areas that need relief that is, until the day that I need it for *gasp* fine lines! Fingers crossed that won’t ever happen to me. ;)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for only one week and it is amazing.  I started a couple years ago with ROC multi-correction and then worked my way up to using skinceuticals retinol this past year, which works fairly well.  I&#x27;m in my early 40s and still will breakout.  This Azure Naturals is the best by far!  Overall, my skin is smoother and brighter, in just one week!  My skin is very sensitive and this is not irritating at all.  Highly recommended and I will purchase more so I don&#x27;t run out.  Thank you for a product that is mostly organic and incredibly effective!</li>
    <li> Nice. No fragrance, gentle but strong.  I am very pleased with the results and will continue to purchase this product.  I am also going to purchase some other products in this line. No fancy marketing or packaging or photo shopped ads, just good stuff!</li>
    <li> I have started using this serum and have found that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin. It also leaves it feeling smooth and soft. Although it does take some time and consistent use for products with retinol to achieve huge results, the short term ones are just as great. I used this after the shower when the skin is towel dried, or you can apply it right before bed as part of your nighttime routine.  The ingredients are top notch with retinol, vitamin e and hyaluronic acid. I noticed organic aloe, witch hazel and organic green tea, which are awesome natural ingredients that also contribute to  healthy skin. I also love that their Azure Naturals products are cruelty free, use organic ingredients, and never test on animals. Overall I would recommend this serum and will continue using it daily to help my skin keep its youthfulness. My skin was softer and smoother after using it for just one week. I did receive this to review but all opinions on its performance are my own.</li>
    <li> I received my order from Amazon in a very timely manor. It was packaged well and came in perfect condition. I liked that it came with instructions to start out slow and to start using it only every other day until you see how your skin will react to it.  I have tried it several times this week and never had the slightest issue with any irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do recommend using at night, both because your skins cells repair themselves most at night and it can cause sensitivity to sun if put on in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that it is a lightweight,non oily feeling product. It is a clear, light gel substance which glides over your skin very nicely. It also does not have a strong odor, so the only thing that reminds you that you have it on is your soft smooth skin.</li>
    <li> Works great! My husband &amp; I both like it and see results.</li>
    <li> I could not use long enough to know if it worked die to other facial issues..  But product was as decribed.  And I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a great product.  It did seem to make my skin softer</li>
    <li> Finished product. Not sure that there was a difference.</li>
    <li> The jury is still out; I will continue to use to complete a 30 days trial.The product has a drying effect so i find myself blending with moisturizer and using every other day.  I attended a black tie affair 1 week following use and received compliments on how glowing and beautiful I looked- which is always appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;I will follow-up with review in a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> To me, my skin is bad. I regularly get pimples and blackheads and buildup on my nose which is hard to get rid of. I have dark spots/acne scars all along my cheeks, chin, between my nose and upper lip and forehead.&lt;br /&gt;I was wary about it at first because my skin usually reacts badly to oil but I just tried it anyway. I used it on a little spot at first but then I decided to just go all out and use it all over my face.&lt;br /&gt;And that was the best thing I have ever done in my life. This product turned my skin from dull, dry, flakey and lifeless to soft, dewy, glowy and moisturized. I&#x27;ve had it for seven days and I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference. I know it&#x27;s going to take a while for the scarring to start to disappear but I feel so much more confident without make up now. I use it morning and night - as a moisturizer - and it&#x27;s like magic.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone&#x27;s skin is different but I recommend this product, even just to try. It&#x27;s affordable and easy to use. I am in love with this product. Definitely will buy again when I run out.&lt;br /&gt;i received a free sample in exchange of my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything for the wrinkles after about 10 days of use and my skin was becoming  full of the look of broken veins and red spots.  I might retry it a couple of days a week later.</li>
    <li> Excellent experience!  I highly recommend! Love it!</li>
    <li> I received my bottle of Azure Naturals ULTIMATE RETINOL Anti Wrinkle Serum in excellent condition and padded with bubble wrap. The bottle was sealed in shrink wrap for added protection also. I loved that this serum has a pump activator which is so easy to use. All you have to do is prime it a few times and squirt a little on your finger. It is a clear light gel like substance which glides over your skin very nicely. There is no stickiness to it and I didn&#x27;t have any irritation to it either.&lt;br /&gt;I liked that this serum isn&#x27;t runny and there was no odor to it. Since using this product for a couple of days my facial skin actually feels softer and my skin tone looks better already. Hopefully with continued use it will diminish the appearance of some of my fine lines also.</li>
    <li> One use and my skin looks brighter and tighter!! I am excited to keep using and keep seeing awesome results!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for one month and don&#x27;t see any change.  If there is a change, my skin does not look as good as it did - I don&#x27;t know why, but it doesn&#x27;t feel like it is doing anything.</li>
    <li> I got a chance to try out Azure Naturals ULTIMATE RETINOL Anti Wrinkle Serum. With 2.5% Retinol + 10% Hyaluronic Acid + Vitamin E + Organic Green Tea + Organic Aloe &amp; Jojoba Oil. Retinol, Vitamin A, is an antioxidant, and thus can interrupt the free-radical damage process that causes skin to look and act older. Which helps in preventing wrinkling and increases collagen production. Retinol is effective at managing acne and eczema, as well as improving discolorations and wrinkles from sun damage. Studies have shown that Retinol can help more than 100 skin issues. There are so many benefits to Vitamin E but one of the biggest is it&#x27;s role as a very powerful antioxidant, Vitamin E helps prevent cancer, heart disease, strokes, cataracts, and some of the signs of aging. This is not to mention the benefits of Hyaluronic Acid, Organic Green Tea, Aloe, and Jojoba Oil.&lt;br /&gt;I use this product after cleansing and toning my face. I do have some fine lines that seem to be fading. It makes my face and neck feel really smooth. I also apply mine on my chest because it&#x27;s just as visible as my neck in most clothes. It&#x27;s very cooling and soothing after I exfoliate my skin. It is light and not overly greasy like some products. I&#x27;ve had no problem with any irritation or drying out. I love that it has no alcohol or parabens, especially since I am applying it to my skin every night. Made in the USA With The Highest Quality Natural and Organic Ingredients Available: 97% Natural, 72% Organic. Contains No Alcohol, No Parabens, Plant Based, No GMO&#x27;s, Cruelty Free and Never Tested On Animals! ONE YEAR MONEY BACK GUARANTEE: A 365-day, 100% Hassle-Free, Money Back Guarantee with a full refund including shipping!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you found this review or any of my other reviews interesting or helpful, please rate is as \\&quot;helpful\\&quot; and or leave a comment. I enjoy writing reviews and hearing feedback about what I have written as I feel reviews help those interested make an informed decision before purchasing. I also feel that honest and informative reviews improve a product by providing insight to the company.</li>
    <li> s the old saying goes, better late than never! I started using the Azure Naturals ULTIMATE RETINOL Anti Wrinkle Serum and hoping to see some results. When you are in your 20&#x27;s and 30&#x27;s, you aren&#x27;t thinking about wrinkles even though you should be and taking precautions against them. Now, being in my early 50&#x27;s, I have started thinking about wrinkles...because I have them. Being a lifelong sun worshiper, I have a ton of them. The one&#x27;s that bother me the most are the one&#x27;s on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using Azure Naturals Anti Wrinkle Serum for about a month, I have noticed a difference. The pictures were taken at the same angles in the same lighting and I can say that there is a difference and some of the wrinkles look tighter. Now granted, nothing is going to completely get rid of the wrinkles at my age, but I&#x27;m happier to see lesser of them.</li>
    <li> Disclaimer: I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Review:  I&#x27;m very impressed with this product.  I love that its all natural and organic.  I love that I can use it at night and just fit it nicely into my bed time routine.  This is one of the first serums that doesn&#x27;t have a smell, scent, or tingling, stickiness, and coloration when I use it.  I can see it working around my eyes in the way that I don&#x27;t have purple/ black eye bags when I&#x27;m up all night with sick children, or I just don&#x27;t get good sleep.  I have seen it working on my neck.  I have seen it working miracles on my forehead and between my eyebrows wrinkles the most.  They aren&#x27;t as severe, noticeable, and deep.  Even though the company offers a full money back guarantee which I quoted above, I honestly don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll need it because the product does what it says it will.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for only 2 months maybe, and have seen positive results, so I can attest to it working.  On top of having a great product, I&#x27;m also very impressed with the company, their customer service is very nice, happy, and respectful.  Even when I was having issues ordering and whatnot for the product review, they were willing to bend over backwards for me.</li>
    <li> Will purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I look years younger.</li>
    <li> Has done great things for my skin. So much that I bought two people some as gifts.</li>
    <li> I have tried other Retinol products and there is a definite difference between them and this product.  That is, with other products you can feel and see the effects of the Retinol, with this product I don&#x27;t.  I am also wondering about the 2.5% Retinol.  Most OTC Retinol products have.05% or if they are strong, .1% Retinol.  2.5% seems very high, and at first I was cautious when using this because of that, and then saw no difference after using a full bottle of it.  It sounds like a great product, but I am not so sure about it.</li>
    <li> I have been using for about a month and I have seen no improvements. The C ends up just drying out my face and even with extra moisturizer, my skin actually ends up looking worse.</li>
    <li> I got this as part of a Tomoson review and have been using it. I am 29 so my wrinkles are not that bad yet, and I am always cautious using retinol products because of the sun I frequent in. However I am going to keep using this product because I do have a few wrinkles on my forehead that I would like to see them  gone . This has made my skin feel smoother though and I will update when I notice improvement in the small wrinkles I have. I admit I have sensitive skin and this product has not bothered my skin at all.</li>
    <li> I just received this &amp;#34;serum&amp;#34; several days ago.  Serum is in quotes because, to me, a serum is a bit watery and sticky.  This is a thick GEL.  The dropper does not work because my serum is so thick. I&#x27;m have to take the dropper out and put some of the serum on the outside of the dropper on my hand.  I am 46, just had a hysterectomy, and was told that my skin would become very dry.  It was already very dry, so I got a few different serums with vitamin C, E and Ferulic Acid, and Retinol for wrinkles.  I do use a collagen cream over the top of these products and then my Go To Nivea Cream because it is nice and thick and has no scent.  I notice that when I take a bath or shower and then massage or pat these products into my skin, it does look plumper and more radiant.  However, within an hour, my skin looks exactly the same.  I am hoping this will begin to really work as there is a full year return on this serum.  The good news is that this product does NOT hurt my eyes!  Everything burns my eyes, but this does not.  I will keep you updated once I use a full bottle of this serum/gel.</li>
    <li> This is still under personal review. I am pairing it with BEST ORGANIC Vitamin C Serum For Face. Botanical 20% Vitamin C + E + Hyaluronic Acid Serum. + Skin Care Ebook.</li>
    <li> I love how this made me feel when using it.</li>
    <li> This product really helped erase the fine wrinkles around my eyes. It was easy to apply and use, but the slight plastic like smell is annoying. It doesn&#x27;t take away from the use of the product though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For full reviews, please check out my blog: laceituplove.blogspot.com</li>
    <li> I love trying new items that can help my skin. For me this serum wasn&#x27;t a fit for my skin. I have super sensitive skin and even following up with a moisturizer my skin stayed super dry. I will be trying the serum on some stretch marks I have along with my derma roller&lt;br /&gt;You can read my full review on my blog.&lt;br /&gt;www.acountrygirlcanreviews.blogspot.com</li>
    <li> I have seen no difference in my face at all.I expected to see smaller or less wrinkles.</li>
    <li> So far I am seeing a lot of peeling even though I am using it as directed but after several weeks I don&#x27;t see any noticeable difference in my skin. Will keep using to see if it gets any better, but so far a waste of money. Bummer, I really wanted this to work and thought the reviews looked promising. More and more I am learning to not trust Amazon reviews. Feel like the companies are having their staff write reviews or they are paying for them.</li>
    <li> This anti-wrinkle serum has really worked to fight the wrinkles on my face-especially those on my forehead and around my eyes. I use it with my Azure Naturals Vitamin C Serum and Hyaluronic Serum and I am looking younger as each week passes. I even had one of my kids&#x27; bus drivers tell me I looked like a baby (age wise) and had to be my little sister because I wasn&#x27;t old enough for kids yet.... I love this serum!</li>
    <li> I like this product more than others I&#x27;ve tried with similar claims - it seems to last longer (perhaps partially due to its thicker consistency?) ... I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles, but I feel this is helping keep that consistent</li>
    <li> JUST DID NOT WORK FOR ME.  I&#x27;D LIKE TO RETURN IT . I BELIEVE IT HAS A GUARANTEE.  HOW DO I RETURN THEM BOTH</li>
    <li> After reading so many glowing reviews for this product, I decided to give it a try.  I waited until I finished the entire bottle before writing my review.  I wanted to give this product a fair chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this product for more than a month, my skin did not improve, and the minimal improvement I did see while using the RoC Retinol Correxion Deep Wrinkle Night Cream prior to this product, was gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion, that sticking to major brands it a better option because they spend thousands to dollars researching their products.  These new companies which pop-up claiming phenomenal results such as “STRONGEST WRINKLE ERASER” simply do not work.</li>
    <li> This product is a great anti ageing product to help keep you looking young. I use this product twice a day and is seeing great results.</li>
    <li> It does not work. I&#x27;ve had this about 2 weeks and there is no difference then before I got it. I am returning this and will not order again. It feels more like a hand lotion than what it is.</li>
    <li> This stuff works!  I feel so much better when I look in the mirror and see significantly less wrinkles on my forehead and neck area.  I have had it for over a month, and still have plenty of serum to last at least two more months.</li>
    <li> Only been using for a few days.  Hoping wrinkles are being erased as I type!</li>
    <li> I lost a lot of weight and needed a lift. Can&#x27;t really say I see a lot difference...</li>
    <li> I am waiting to see the results, only been using for about a week.  Leaves the face feeling clean!</li>
    <li> May have cleared some blemishes but not what I expected.</li>
    <li> This really seems to be working on my lines around my mouth. I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> I love how it feels on my skin, but most of all the results, not to mention the price, which makes this product even better.Love it!!!</li>
    <li> Wow this is amazing! The results came so fast. I have oily skin and some moderate adult acne. I don&#x27;t think this really does anything for oil control, and I&#x27;m not sure if it helps with acne. I know that it doesn&#x27;t make it worse and that my acne heals a little faster. The thing that this serum does best though, is that it makes my skin look so smooth! My pores are smaller, and my skin tone looks more even. Looks like my face is glowing. This can make your face a little sticky though, so make sure to follow through with a moisturizer, because this doesn&#x27;t moisturize, it&#x27;s not really it&#x27;s job to do that.</li>
    <li> In another life, I was a soap and water girl. Throughout the last few months, I&#x27;ve been working to balance products that will work together to maintain and even improve the condition of my skin. As I continue to develop my skincare routine, I discovered Azure Naturals&#x27; Ultimate Retinol Anti-Wrinkle Serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is recommended that you start using retinol in your late twenties or early thirties. I&#x27;ve given this product the thirty day test to see if it&#x27;s the real deal. Since *cough cough* I&#x27;m not in the described age-range, it did take me a little longer to see results. BUT I did see results!  As it works with my other skincare products, I notice a smoother texture to my skin. I also started using it on a dreaded age spot on my hand - it&#x27;s fading without a doubt!</li>
    <li> I was satisfied with the product, but I did not find it to have super strong effect on me.</li>
    <li> This product is not close to what I expected. ROC products do better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few retinol products in my battle with the aging process and this one has shown to be very effective in just a few short weeks. Every formula is going to take a little time because cell regeneration isn&#x27;t instantaneous when you apply any product. Anyone who says it does is lying to you. But given a couple weeks (I could see visible results within the first 3 weeks) this product definitely reduces the appearance of fine lines and helps tighten loose skin. I love that this formula is almost 100% natural. I use it in conjunction with Azure Natural&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum and it has been working beautifully. It applies smoothly and doesn&#x27;t leave any film or residue and doesn&#x27;t break me out. Huge plus. With the results I&#x27;ve gotten with this product I would definitely recommend this and the brand as well. They have truly made a quality product line and I am a firm believer in the products I&#x27;ve used from them. I did receive my bottle free for testing and evaluation purposes but my review is solely based on my experience having used it.</li>
    <li> The product reduced eye wrinkles, but it also gave me acne.  I used this product for about a week to prevent lines as I age. The serum is lightweight and easy to apply. About 2 pumps covers my entire face. There may have been a slight difference in the appearance of eye wrinkles, but if any, it was really minimal. I have very sensitive, acne prone skin so it is always a challenge to find products that work well with my skin type. There was no harsh drying or redness after using this product as I have found with some of the competitors. It did, however, cause a moderate break out which ultimately caused me to stop using the product.   I was compensated for my review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to use this every morning. One note of caution, when you press the cap, the liquid tends to &amp;#34;squirt&amp;#34; out, so either press gently, or position your finger properly.  If not, it shoot everywhere.  The actual liquid itself goes on smooth, and feels great.  I need to use it longer to see if I notice any improvements, but initial results are goo.</li>
    <li> Before this serum, I have never used a product that has actually given me noticeable results. I have only been using it for a couple of days yet my skin looks so different. It&#x27;s radiant and smooth, and I haven&#x27;t broken out from this serum unlike other serums I&#x27;ve tried. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I like this stuff so far. I don&#x27;t see huge results but I think it helps my 38 year old face keep a youthful look.</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff and I think it is as good as a product can be especially for the price! I do believe it is removing age spots on my hands.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!  I wish it came in larger bottles.</li>
    <li> due to 20 lbs weight loss,  my face REALLY showed the wrinkles.  After using this product I do see an improvement.</li>
    <li> VERY PLEASED WITH LONG TERM USE</li>
    <li> The first thing I love is that the bottle has a pump. Now this may seem insignificant to some but if you&#x27;ve used other similar products you&#x27;ll know that 9/10 times they have a dropper for application. I hate those! Not only does it make application harder, it also requires being opened up to expose the product to air and bacteria.  The pump bottle is so much better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for how it makes my skin feel. Answer- amazing! I&#x27;m left with the softest touchable smooth  skin ever. I&#x27;m not even kidding. It&#x27;s like silk!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the biggest question is can it do what it claims? Can it plump and erase those pesky lines we all loathe? Yes it can! It works to not only gradually diminish those lines for good, but it also gives you an firmer and more plump appearance immediately upon application. No irritation, no sticky heavy feeling. Just flawless perfect skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for that perfect serum, look no further! It&#x27;s time in a bottle!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything at all for me.</li>
    <li> I mix in one pump with my favorite moisturizer and my skin is even and clear.  I am forty-nine and look a decade younger.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS SERUM! No its not a miracle in a jar. I still have my fine lines under my eyes. This product, however, has given me some pretty radiant skin. It&#x27;s reduced my pores and made my skin extremely soft and smooth. The product does not burn but I do put it on AFTER I apply the vitamin c serum. One thing I do not like is that they advertise this falsely. There&#x27;s no way this is 2.5%. Anyone who has ever used a 1.0% retinol would agree. This stuff would burn like crazy if it were that potent, but it doesn&#x27;t burn at all or make you peel.</li>
    <li> So far I have not seen much of a difference using this product, but I have only been using it for 2 weeks. I am hoping to see a difference after longer use. If you are looking for rapid results, this product may not be for you. I do not have deep wrinkles, but have some expression lines I am hoping this would help with. Still hopeful though...</li>
    <li> Vitamin C and Retinol are the products that are a regular part of my skin care regimen. The Retinol from Oz Natural has a 2.5% concentration and it also contains Hyaluronic Acid and green tea. It is not very harsh on my skin. I use it every night after washing my face and I don&#x27;t get &amp;#34;peelies&amp;#34; like with prescription strength Retinol. It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin. After two weeks use my skin looks fresher and more firm. I use SPF30 in the morning and avoid direct sun as with the use of Retinol the skin becomes more sensitive to sun rays so It is important to use a higher SPF product. I&#x27;ll continue using it. Anyone who is afraid to try Retinol because it dries your skin and skin starts to peel, should give this one a try. You&#x27;ll be happy you did. Get the benefits of Retinol without the nasty peeling. Have a glowing skin.</li>
    <li> Honestly I ordered the product but didn&#x27;t even try it. That was because I had just purchased Azure Naturals  Hyaluronic Acid Moisturizer and was very disappointed. I lost confidence in the product. I ordered Azure Naturals because I was looking for an organic alternative. If you are the same, try Juice Beauty. It&#x27;s a Quality product at a comparable price.</li>
    <li> No difference for me I still use it on my neck. I bought this with the Vitamin C serum. Not good results.</li>
    <li> This is a great anti wrinkle product. I apply it daily. I&#x27;ve noticed a change for the better. A little goes a long way. Awesome product!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why but retinol does not work well for me. it just makes my skin more rough and itchy. I do give it time but I don&#x27;t see any improvements.</li>
    <li> THIS DOES NOT WORK! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!  I only gave 1 star because I had to!</li>
    <li> The Azure Naturals Ultimate Retinol Anti Wrinkle Serum makes a great gift or for personal use. With the holidays sneaking up on us this would make a perfect stocking stuffer. I find it amazing how this serum is able to boost your skins collagen &amp; elastin. Plus with its boost natural &amp; organic ingredients its a high quality product that feels great on your skin.</li>
    <li> I found this serum to be very effective.  I would buy it again!</li>
    <li> Well, seems to be working great. Would of been happier if it had some Vitamin C in it too. Not an amazing difference so far but, skin does look better overall. I use it almost nightly, did get some increase in breakouts but, I think it is more that the Retinol is working and peeling some dead skin off.  Will purchase again. Pump bottle is great and smart use of dark bottle to avoid damage by sunlight to contents.</li>
    <li> I got this serum for free to try and review as part of a promotion. I have used this serum for about four days now and I used a wrinkle cream afterwards. I have mild wrinkles on my forehead and I notice they are smoothing out. Keep in mind not everyone will see results and also my wrinkles are not deep at all. Also my lines on the right side of my mouth are smoothing out and again they are not deep at all. If you have deep wrinkles you might have to use the product for awhile before seeing results. Also keep in mind I use a wrinkle cream after I use this Anti wrinkle serum. This serum absorbs fast into my skin and doesn&#x27;t leave it greasy or oily.</li>
    <li> I tried this product as a product test and I will buy this product because it works. I have been using Azure for just over two weeks and can see a noticeable improvement in my fine lines, ok not so fine. I am a 43 year old smoker and x- sun goddess. I have some really deep lines that started popping out about three years ago. I have tried  everything within my price range which is cheap. When offered to test this product they named my price just right, 5.95 shipping ad handling. I didn&#x27;t expect to much but this product has done amazing things to soften my face. I really do feel 5 years younger. Azure Naturals lasts a long time to, for the two weeks I have been using it I can hardly see any gone and when I say I&#x27;m cheap I&#x27;m cheap. I have been using one squirt and that actually covers my whole face. Until they find a cure for wrinkles I will settle for improvement and continue to be a customer. Thank You.</li>
    <li> this stuff is fanstastic</li>
    <li> I had the wonderful opportunity to try out Azure Naturals Ultimate Retinol Anti Wrinkle Serum. I used this product for a little over 2 weeks and really feel a difference in my skin. This product uses natural and organic ingredients. Retinol is one of the most effective ingredients for reducing fine lines and wrinkles. I have just started getting fine lines and they are barely visible after just 2 short weeks of using this product. It is proven to also improve pigmentation, skin texture, skin tone, and also increases skins hydration levels, which is great for me! I have very dry skin and this long winter did not help. Uses this product helped my skin feel more moisturized and hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As we age, cellular renewal slows down. Retinol is able to penetrate the skin and activate collagen and elastin. If you apply this at night it will increase your skins moisture, help with cellular renewal. This product should be started in your twenties and thirties because Retinol can fight fine lines before they even appear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is great and the company is great as well. This product contains no alcohol, no parabens, no GMO’s and is plant based. It is also cruelty free and NEVER tested on animals. These are important things to know if you ask me! They back their product up with a one-year money back guarantee! I recommend that everyone check out this product and see for yourself how wonderful it is!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this solidly for 4 weeks now and will say it is doing a very good job.  I can see a big change in lines and wrinkles around my mouth and eyes.  I am very pleased and will purchase it again and recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> Date Purchased/Length of Ownership: 3/24/15 Price Paid: $15.95 for 1 oz  Skin Type: Oily + Comedonal Acne-prone  -------- | Pros | -------- + Improved my skin’s texture (made it look smoother &amp; more moisturized) within 1 week of usage + Non-comedogenic (does NOT cause acne) + 1 pump covers full face (2 pumps if you prefer a thicker layer, which I found unnecessary) + Helps fade acne scars + Amber bottle prevents oxidation (UV breakdown of the chemical components) + Good packaging (glass bottle w/pump &amp; clear plastic cap for travel) + Hyaluronic Acid (moisturizer) + 2.5% Retinol (acne treatment) in the same serum + No scent + Gel texture makes it easy to spread + Absorbs quickly + Does not leave a greasy feel/residue + Reasonably priced @ $15.95/oz + No adverse side effects --------- | Cons | --------- - A bit pricey if you use it daily (but one of the less expensive retinol serums available) - (As with any retinol product) You MUST use sunscreen to protect your skin during daytime.  Retinol increases exfoliation which means your skin has one less epidermal layer to protect itself from UV radiation.  Do NOT use this product if you intend to forgo sunscreen.  The damage done by the extra UV exposure will offset (if not completely reverse) the anti-aging effects of the serum. --------------- | Notes/Tips | ---------------  I started out using one pump every 2 days.  It is recommended that you start out slow to let your skin get used to the serum.  I alternate this with a Hyaluronic Acid serum every other day  I spread one pump over my entire face using my fingers in large circular motions to get the most thorough possible coverage  SPF 30 (minimum) zinc oxide sunscreen should be used when using this serum.</li>
    <li> Retinol really in there?? I&#x27;ve been using for about a month now. I notice absolutely nothing. I wonder if there really is any retinol in it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the pump, it didn&#x27;t work, had to use and eyedropper. The product is good.</li>
    <li> Works well, and feels as strong as advertised.</li>
    <li> Can see  positive results. Good quality retinal.</li>
    <li> I like the product.  I am sure it would take at least three months of consistent use to determine if your wrinkles are in fact reduced.&lt;br /&gt;I have neared one bottle&#x27;s end.  My wrinkles may be softer but, I use other products too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s face it, a warm cloth on the face for 15 minutes will make the appearance of wrinkles less noticeable.  I  will probably order again as retinol is documented to help over time.</li>
    <li> I love how it feels on my skin!</li>
    <li> No results it might even got worse. Makes me skeptical to believe any more reviews on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Only used this stuff a few times and am already seeing positive results.  Only thing is you need to moisturize more!</li>
    <li> After reading the awesome reviews, maybe I just had too high of hopes. I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 weeks now- I started once at night, but it wasn&#x27;t doing anything, and switched to applying it in the AM and PM.  Some reviewers said it&#x27;s drying and their skin gets red, but I have pretty sensitive skin and I&#x27;ve never had a bad reaction.  I do like to still use it, even though I don&#x27;t see any real results becuase it makes my skin soft.  I&#x27;m going to continue using it until the bottle is gone, and I&#x27;ll write another review. Again, maybe I&#x27;m just being impatient with it, hopefully I&#x27;ll see a difference in another 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t very impressed</li>
    <li> The produce does indeed reduce wrinkles (forehead). It must not be used near eyes - will burn. Also, consider skipping a day between uses, it can redden and irritate skin. I also have psoriasis, and this irritates that condition. Do no use on red-patchy skin areas. Do not ever use near eyes, even nearby it will &#x27;migrate&#x27; and irritate eyes. However, to reduce wrinking and give a nice complexion to skin, I found it to work quite well. Use at night before bed as recommended to assure no redness on skin the next work day.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Started using the Azure Naturals Retinol, Hyaluronic Acid Moisturizer, and the Vitamin C about 2-3 months ago. They do what they claim. No negative reactions in my sensitive skin. Very pleased with the results: Significantly faded age spots, fine lines are softened, healthier looking skin.</li>
    <li> Great retinol product.</li>
    <li> I love it. I use it all over my face including the eyes every night and my skin is really nice.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t really work well for me. I was so sad because I was really hopeful.</li>
    <li> really does make a noticeable difference in my skin!</li>
    <li> I have tried numerous retinol products over the last few years.  They never seemed to do much except give me cystic acne.  I had tried so many that I assumed I was allergic to retinol itself, not any additives.  But, I decided to try just one more product and this one caught my eye.  Azure Naturals uses natural, organic ingredients, including green tea, which is a really powerful ingredient with its skin healing properties.  I was very skeptical of this brand because I had never heard of it, and I figured anyone can sell anything they want on Amazon, and make any claims they want, without any quality control that I&#x27;m aware of.  I am so glad I took a chance.  I have only used 2 squirts every night for 6 nights and I can already see a huge difference.  I have blotchy skin and sun spots from years of sun exposure, but only a few wrinkles for a 41 year old.  The tone of my skin is evening out quite a bit and I have not gotten a single pimple, which is a miracle for my sensitive skin.  The wrinkles are the same, but time will tell with those, I suspect.  About an hour after I apply this I put on a small amount of organic coconut oil as a moisturizer.  As a side note, I have tried numerous moisturizers as well, and this oil is very hydrating without breaking me out.  Maybe the combination is a good one,  I sincerely hope that anyone who gets a pimple if someone gives them a dirty look, and anyone who has sun damaged skin will give this product a chance.</li>
    <li> Useless product with no results.</li>
    <li> This has not performed as I expected.  Have seen no difference in my wrinkles.  Would not spend the money to purchase another bottle.</li>
    <li> I have used other similar product, Vitamin C serum and their Hyaluronic Acid serum but this is over the top amazing. In just a few days it has totally smoothed the skin around my eye area.  Totally recommend to another user</li>
    <li> I love it! it doesn&#x27;t take much @ all to cover your face.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because of all the great reviews and I have to say I&#x27;m very disappointed. I have fine lines under my eyes and have been trying to find a good product to minimize them. I used this product for 2 months and I woke every morning with really puffy eyes and my lines looked a lot deeper. I went to an Obagi eye product and the lines are finally reducing, not gone, but a whole lot better than they were and I don&#x27;t have puffy eyes anymore.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the performance of this serum.  My skin felt highly moisturized, but not greasy.  My skin tone definitely became more even; I tend to have hyper-rosy cheeks, and this serum helps to reduce that appearance.  I also noticed that my skin complexion appeared healthier and more supple.  Given my age, I can&#x27;t speak to its ability to fight fine lines and wrinkles, but I would imagine it would do a great job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself has a very pleasant appearance.  The dark glass protects the serum from light exposure, which is really good.  The dispenser provides the perfect amount of serum needed for a single application (instead of dispensing 2-3x as much as what&#x27;s needed like other dispensers do!).  The cap prevents accidental spillage, contamination, etc.  And, the label colors are great; so many companies use color combinations that make part of the label impossible to read.  But this bottle&#x27;s label can be read easily!</li>
    <li> In just a few days, my skin felt so much softer and looked so much better.  My wrinkles are less noticeable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 58-year old man and use this as an after-shave almost every day.  I previously used the BabyFace retinol cream -- which is also an excellent product -- but my girlfriend thinks it makes my face look oily, so I decided to try this.  I&#x27;m extremely pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Retinol is no gimmick, unlike most of the nonsense that the beauty industry sells.  Retinoids were developed by the pharmaceutical industry to treat acne and repair sun-damaged skin.  The first blockbuster was &amp;#34;Retin A&amp;#34; (tretinoin), still sold only by prescription.  Retinoids are derived from Vitamin A, but they are not the same as generic Vitamin A so beware of products containing only Vitamin A, which has absolutely no value as a topical cream, no matter what strength.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following link gives a reasonable description of the difference between tretinoin and retinol:  http://www.webmd.com/beauty/face/beauty-411-retin-a-vs-retinol.  This link gives a lot more information on skin care and the research (or lack of it) behind various skin treatments:  http://umm.edu/health/medical/reports/articles/skin-wrinkles-and-blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the bottom line is that this product is at least as good as the BabyFace retinol cream at making my skin look healthy and helping to prevent blemishes; I like it a lot!  Don&#x27;t expect immediate results, but use it daily for 3-4 weeks and you&#x27;ll notice a very positive difference.  My only complaint is that the pump on the bottle is pretty powerful, so if you don&#x27;t aim carefully the product can squirt across the room.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this particular product from Azure about a month so it&#x27;s really too early to tell much except it makes my face feel firmer after application.  I&#x27;m confident that the ingredients are good as I regularly order the vitamin C from Azure and now use these in tandem.  I will continue to use and will update my post at a later date.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 22 for the second time and I have to say, this is the 5th night I&#x27;ve used this product and I am noticing a brightening to my skin that prescribed retina a gives.  Doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy so my pillow isn&#x27;t all slimy (unless I drooled on it). This will be part of my beauty regime from now on.</li>
    <li> Not really seeing a difference</li>
    <li> This made my skin feel great, and after continued use I&#x27;ve really seen improvement.</li>
    <li> I am loving this product! Shrinks pores, smoothes out skin texture, lightens hyperpigmentation and has actually made a remarkable difference on my acne prone skin (hormonal acne). I notice a radiant glow like appearance to my skin and this product has made my skin incredibly soft. The fine lines that were just starting to show up around my eyes (I&#x27;m 25) are GONE! They weren&#x27;t a big deal but I love that this serum completely diffused them! My skin looks really plump and moisturized without being oily. What&#x27;s really amazing about this serum is that it is the most effective retinol treatment I&#x27;ve used, and it is simultaneously the least irritating! By &amp;#34;least&amp;#34; I mean- I experienced no initial purge and no peeling, redness, scaly skin..you name it. If you&#x27;re on the fence, I say: Try It! Just use sparingly, one pump goes a lonnnnng way! :)</li>
    <li> Absolutely love AzureNaturals products. I combine this with their Ultimate C serum, and my face looks so fresh and healthy. I highly recommend this line of beauty products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*received free for review purposes*</li>
    <li> So I have only been using this product for 3 days and this morning when I woke up, I&#x27;m thinking to myself, &amp;#34;what the heck did I do, my skin looks great&amp;#34; then I remembered I had added this to my regime . I already use Azures, awesome Vit. C serum and their Hyaluronic Acid serum but this is over the top amazing. In just these few days it has totally smoothed the skin around my eye area. I love it! Totally recommend!</li>
    <li> I really like this product in the short time I&#x27;ve been using it I&#x27;ve notice my face  is much smother it&#x27;s great !! I see the difference .</li>
    <li> Excellent service; great product</li>
    <li> Azure Naturals Ultimate Retinol Serum not only contains a professional strength percentage of 2.5% retinol, but 10% hyaluronic acid, which can attract and retain more than thousand times their weight in water, thus giving our skin more hydration and plump up and smooth out fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Retinol is a Vitamin A derivative and is a very potent antioxidant that helps combat not only aging concerns, but also helps with acne and troubled skin.  Not only does retinol help with fine lines, wrinkles,  hyper-pigmentation due to aging and sun damage, acne, but reduces and heals scarring and discoloration from scars from acne, along with increasing the moisture level in your skin, boosting collagen and elastin production and speeding up cell turnover, inhibit free radical skin cell damage and exfoliating dead skin cells.  Retinol also increases blood vessels formation, so that helps with circulation, which in turn makes your skin look healthy and bright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As we age, we naturally will develop fine lines, wrinkles, sun damage, hyper-pigmentation and other signs of skin aging.  Retinol (Vitamin A) is an ingredients that can \\&quot;talk\\&quot; to your cells and remind them to be healthy.  Seriously, this is called a \\&quot;cell communication\\&quot; ingredient&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Azure Naturals Ultimate Retinol Serum comes in a dark bottle with a pump applicator, which is my preferred applicator type over eye droppers.  This is a clear, thicker gel ~ not watery ~ but medium weight, in the consistency of aloe vera gel.  It has a scent of herbal botanical, due to the organic herbal infusion ingredient. This serum absorbs quickly into my skin as I massage it in for full absorbance.  I like to use retinol only in the evening, not in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As this is a serum, the product will initially leave my skin hydrated, but as it penetrates deeper into my dermal layer, I will not notice the product on my skin anymore.  That is what a serum does ~ it does not just sit on the top layer.  I always follow up with a moisturizer, as that will lock in the nutrients from this serum in my skin and also provide a hydrating, moisture barrier on my facial skin.  Since retinol can cause UV sensitivity, always use a SPF product, whether it is in your moisturizer or foundation/BB creams; otherwise, you are more susceptible to hyper-pigmentation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product also contains a few more good ingredients worthy of note:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Hyaluronic Acid ~ absorbs water, locks in moisture and creates cell \\&quot;plumpness\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;  Organic Jojoba Oil ~ a natural emollient that has a similar structure to your own sebum allows this oil to absorb easily into your skin&lt;br /&gt;  Phospholipids ~ powerful humectant, usually derived from soy lecithin,  that is \\&quot;very effective in mimicking and enhancing the skin&#x27;s ability to retain moisture and protect it from external factors.\\&quot; (source)&lt;br /&gt;  Vitamin E ~ The antioxidants of all antioxidants ~ prevents free radical formation, protects the upper skin layer from initial harmful UV radiation and prevents the deterioration of fats in your cell membranes.&lt;br /&gt;  Green Tea Extract ~ Green Tea contains antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-carcinogenic properties, as well as the ability to prevent collagen breakdown and reduces UV sun damage to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;  Propolis (Wildcrafted Resina Propoli)  ~  this resinous material gathered by honeybee, mixed with their enzymes, is a powerful antiseptic,  anti-microbial and anti-fungal, as well as antioxidant, preventing cell damage&lt;br /&gt;  Witch Hazel ~ an anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial (soothes and heals the skin), astringent (due to the large quantity of tannins), and locks in moisture to your skin&lt;br /&gt;  Triticum Vulgare (wheat germ oil) ~ a skin conditioner, full of Vitamin E, which is beneficial to your skin&lt;br /&gt;  Aloe Vera ~ soothes and heals sun burns, tones skin, shrinks pores, and is a rich source of silicon to help the skin regenerate&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does not contain Vitamin C, so I do not mind that it has sodium benzoate, which is only controversial if the product list specifically contained Vitamin C.

    <li> I could see a noticeable difference in only 2 weeks. Feels really nice on the skin.</li>
    <li> I just got this about a week ago, I really like it so far: it is non-greasy and fast absorbant, and I can see my skin getting a healthy glow after about only a week&#x27;s use. 2 oz is a much better deal.</li>
    <li> I love this brand. They have fantastic customer service and awesome products. I highly recommend all of them that I&#x27;ve tried. I have not personally noticed a loss of wrinkles from using this product, but that&#x27;s only because i do not yet have any wrinkles to begin with. I do love the feel of this serum and love the way it makes my skin feel. I am hoping it will be a wrinkle prevention tool :)</li>
    <li> Send it back did not in my skin</li>
    <li> It broke my face out.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, this product doesn&#x27;t work. Use Glycolic acid instead.</li>
    <li> Tonight was my first Azure Retinol application and I love the way this product feels - NOT YOUR TYPICAL SERUM! Sunk right in to my skin with no sticky feeling or peeling later. Slight tingle upon application, but not uncomfortable. Azure sent fantastic use instructions upon my products arrival, so I will be using this every other night until my skin has built a tolerance. For reference, I have combination, acne-prone skin and am wanting to correct fine wrinkles and prevent new ones as I age! As far as I know, 2.5% Retinol is the highest you can get without a prescription. Considering most companies won&#x27;t even provide the % Retinol in their products, at this price it is a complete steal. Very happy thus far! In 2 weeks I&#x27;ll add to this review :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, so I couldn&#x27;t wait a full 2 weeks to update - I LOVE THIS SERUM! My acne has improved greatly since I began use of this product. I tend to get small pimples on my upper arms/shoulders (probably from sweating so much at the gym) and that has diminished greatly since I began using the retinol product there too. My forehead wrinkles (which I was greatly concerned would soon become deep) have diminished in just over 10 days of use. I use this every night and my skin is glowing and smooth! I apply Waxelene as my moisturizer over the serum at night, but I still have noticed minimal flaking of my skin - very common with retinol products &amp; as compared to when I tried RetinA, no big deal (I literally thought my face would peel off with RetinA, I could never enjoy any benefits it was so intense).  Whenever I finally need to reorder (the 1 oz should last so long), I&#x27;ll definitely be getting the larger size! I just love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27; m using it until. I&#x27;ll tell you later if it world good.</li>
    <li> I love this serum. I was having a hard time finding a good natural product for my acne prone skin. It makes my skin feel great and it works around my eyes wonderfully! The results are fast. I will recommended it highly and remember for best results be faithful in using it for a few months. Even though, I noticed a difference within a week!</li>
    <li> Terrific!!! My skin started looking better right away.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. I am usually a skeptic of a product like this but it has pleasantly surprised me. It has been able to fix in one month, what 6 months of chemical peels and microdermabrasion couldn&#x27;t. I have rough skin due to PCOS. A little bit of adult acne (it&#x27;s mostly under control now) and lots of scars. My scars are almost gone, my pores have shrunk and my skin is glowing. I have used it with Tamanu oil, and rosehip seed oil. I plan on ordering Azure Naturals Vitamin C Serum to get even better results. Highly recommend this product!  Update-I ordered the vitamin c when I first wrote the review. It compliments the retinol very well. It hydrates my skin and makes it soft. I can&#x27;t say enough about this great line of skincare!</li>
    <li> I have to say I&#x27;m not really sure yet. I have been using this product for two weeks I can&#x27;t see any results. I was hoping based on the reviews that I read that this product would be awesome. I will continue to use a little longer and hopefully it will come through as promised. I am also using the OZ Naturals Eye gel for puffiness,etc.</li>
    <li> Azure Naturals was kind enough to send me a bottle of their Ultimate Retinol Anti-Wrinkle Serum to test and review for the Beauty Diva blog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great Anti-Wrinkle Facial Serum&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The anti-wrinkle serum is available in both a 1-ounce and 2-ounce brown glass bottle with dispensing pump. The serum contains a blend of hyaluronic acid, Vitamin E oil, jojoba oil and 2.5% of retinol. The serum has the consistency of a thick drop of oil but once spread onto your face, is easily absorbed into your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the anti-wrinkle serum in the morning, after getting out of the shower. I apply a couple of drops of the serum to the tips of my fingers and smooth across my neck, upper lip and eye area. The ultimate retinol serum doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Azure Naturals recommends applying the oil to your face, at night, every other day to start. After a few weeks you can use the serum on a daily basis. The serum helps reduce the appearance of fine lines and helps improve skin tone.</li>
    <li> So far so good. I&#x27;ve used 3 pumps of lotion for 5 nights so far. I have had no peeling and really it&#x27;s too soon to say if it&#x27;s worked or not. But I have high hopes!!</li>
    <li> It hasn&#x27;t hurt my skin... it hasn&#x27;t helped my skin (wrinkles).  I&#x27;ve made the switch to plain old Coconut Oil - love it!</li>
    <li> Completely non-effective.  A complete waste of time and money.</li>
    <li> I got this product free to try from I Love To Review, and when I first tried it out i did not like it, because it was runny but after using it for a couple of weeks I can honestly say I love this product my skin feels softer and you do not have to use a lot of it. After I wash my face at night I put a small amount on I&#x27;m 53 years old and have a scar by my eye that is not as noticeable.</li>
    <li> I am loving this product! it does a great job on pores, smoothes out skin texture and has made a remarkable difference on my acne prone skin. Lots of reviews have lots of information. All i can say is if you are fence just try it and you will see the difference.  I got this a heavy discount but i am going to buy more in the future.</li>
    <li> I would have to say this serum is pretty good. i recieved this product free, and they gave me the option to review this product. I think it works pretty well, i dont have alot of wrinkles, but i do have some fine lines. It tingles a tiny bit and theres a slight burning sensation when you rub it in, but i have VERY sensitive skin, so that just might be for me. I used it for a week to track the results so i could honestly review this product, and every time i used it for a while afterwards my face would feel just a bit tighter. My face looks a lot less worn after a week of using this product, and my skin is glowing. I like it but it smells weird, thats my only problem with it, and the burning sensation.&lt;br /&gt;For the price, if you are looking to try a new wrinkle serum, go ahead and try this one.</li>
    <li> Great product and it seems to work</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple weeks now and I can see a big difference in the fine lines on my forehead. Leaves kind of a tacky residue but goes away once I put my moisturizer over the top.</li>
    <li> Great Product overall but the package when shipped had some leakage. So be aware.</li>
    <li> I received this wrinkle eraser for free to review. It took me a while to write a review. As us women know, For a wrinkle eraser to show any results you have to give it time, And the time I gave it just was not enough or it simply doesnt work the way I hoped for, The texture is really heavy for my skin type. In which that was a feature in its self I wouldnt purchase this. The smell , well there really was no smell. The packaging was great, I wouldnt ever reach for this again. It did nothing for my wrinkles. I really wish it would have, We all know finding that special do it all cream is such a pain.</li>
    <li> I really like Azure naturals serums.  This one is very light and if you have never used retinol before it definitely makes a difference in your beauty routine.  you have to be careful to wear sunscreen when using this or any retinol product but I would highly reccommend it.  I anticipate this bottle lasting about 7 weeks maybe a bit longer- you don&#x27;t need much to cover your entire face and only use once a day!  No scent, all natural ingredients!  My skin never showed signs of any irritation from this product.  I do not have super sensitive skin but it is mildly sensitive and a lot of products will irritate it but not this one.</li>
    <li> This was my first time using a product like this. I&#x27;m getting older and I can see a difference in my skin. I like the this product leaves my face and neck feeling. It&#x27;s not sticky at all. I love that.</li>
    <li> So I have only been using this product for 8 days and this morning when I woke up, I’m thinking to myself, “WOW, my skin looks great”. I already use Azures, awesome Vit. C serum and their Hyaluronic Acid serum but this is over the top amazing. In just these few days it has totally smoothed the skin around my eye area. I love it! Totally recommend! It goes on light and doesnt feel sticky or greasy. I love how it makes my skin feel and look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> Ladies and gentlemen I must confess I underestimated the power of this serum. I never imagined one serum can drive powerful results so quickly. Simply because it drives key ingredients into your skin. Sometimes my expectancy is that of time versus daily results. So I am loyally impressed but let me take a couple steps back and tell you why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently tried Azure Naturals Ultimate Retinol Anti Wrinkle Serum. It is a 2.5% Retinol serum. Yes, gone are the days that only the elite can afford Retinol products. We now see the celebrity quality right at now. Not only does it have Retinol is has Vitamin E, 10% Hyaluronic Acid, Organic Green Tea, Organic Aloe &amp; Jojoba Oil, and other key professional grade ingredients designed to erase those stubborn fine lines and wrinkles, deeply hydrate and nourish the skin, repair and heal acne, and all while reducing our pore size and leaving our skin plump, glowing, and simply radiant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Azure Naturals Ultimate Retinol Anti Wrinkle Serum continuously feeds our skin as it prompts it to build collagen and elastin in our skin. Creating and renewing our skin like we did when we where in our 20&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your in your 30&#x27;s, 40&#x27;s, 50&#x27;s... you have no time to lose. Invest in your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Organic, Natural, Cruelty Free, Plant Based Serum will leave your skin feeling its most radiant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it today. Buy with confidence. Made proudly in the USA with a Money Back Guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have nothing to lose but years off your face.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a change as of yet, been about a month.</li>
    <li> Still waiting for results.</li>
    <li> No noticeable difference after using daily for an entire bottle.</li>
    <li> I have tried this retinol serum lately and it worked wonderfully in my daily routine for day time! I usually use vitamin C serum in my night routine, and retinol serum in my morning routine. The serum is super moisturizing and absorbs fast. My makeup (after skin care and sunscreen) also looks more natural and lasts longer when I use this serum. It makes my face feeling smoother.&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to dispense the right amount of product with the pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product with a promotion. My review is honest and unbiased.</li>
    <li> I love this serum.  I am in my early 40&#x27;s and have been using this for a month now.  I have been receiving a lot of complements recently on how great I look.  This is not a miracle serum but it has helped with the lines on my forehead and the &#x27;11&#x27;s&#x27; between the eyes.  I would definitely recommend this product and I will be purchasing more when I run out.</li>
    <li> Great serum. Will orde again</li>
    <li> Been using Asure Naturals products for well over a year now, and while I know there&#x27;s no magic bullet, their products are quality and I am liking how they are on my skin, and I have had compliments about my skin too. Since I have used them daily, they must be contributing well to my skin care.</li>
    <li> I bought the smaller one ounce bottle to try this serum, and I&#x27;m repurchasing the larger size, so I think that says it all.  I use it nightly and have noticed my skin is smoother, makeup applies more evenly, it does not leave a sticky or drying &amp;#34;tug&amp;#34; to my face and neck, and most importantly it makes my skin feel soft and supple.  I notice a difference in my skin&#x27;s overall appearance and texture since I&#x27;ve started using this product.  Is it equivalent to a facelift?  No.  But it does what it promises.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> So I am only 22 so of course I don’t have many wrinkles yet,but I did use it anyways and I love it.It made my face smooth and soft.Also it did not make me break out which is shocking to me because its super strong retinol and I have very sensitive skin,so that’s a huge plus.The one thing is since I started using this I noticed I am a little more sensitive to the sun,but It does tell you that can happen on the bottle,I just applied some face lotion with a low spf in it and that worked fine over this to help with the sun.it I was looking at the ingredients and I love seeing that this has a ton of organic ingredients in it since I have been trying to use and eat more of them lately. Also the fact that it lists the ingredients is a plus as well since I have received some products for review **not from this company** that did not have anything listed but what if I want to know or ask my doctor about it how can I tell if its healthy/good for you if it says nothing.but azure naturals listed it so that great,as far as wrinkles go I am going to nicely in a un-insulting way ask my mom or someone with wrinkles to give this a try and ill write a follow up soon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;https://www.tumblr.com/dashboard</li>
    <li> I use a 1.0 retinol by another brand and I can really feel it working, yet this &amp;#34;claims&amp;#34; 2.5 and I feel zero effects that retinol has. It is a good moisturizer but as far as skin correction the retinol is not there.</li>
    <li> Not as great as its claiming.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t notice any improvements</li>
    <li> I have tried several Retinol products and this one, I feel, is the best!</li>
    <li> Like how it makes my skin feel.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;re using this for my son&#x27;s acne.</li>
    <li> Finally a company that creates a very good product with quality ingredients and doesn&#x27;t overcharge for it. This is an excellent retinol if used as directed. Retinol in general should not be used during the day as it interacts with the sun and can cause harm to your skin because it is very potent. I use 4-5 times a week at night and see a marked difference in skin quality. I also wear an spf of 30 or more (make sure the sunscreen is high quality and has a high zinc factor), in addition to a wide brim hat during the day to protect my face from the sun as my dermatologist advised while using retinol. My skin looks more plumped and luminous. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> Loved this product.  I was given a sample to try, and I&#x27;m getting more.  I used it every other day due to sensitive skin, even though this is a mild product, I had no redness as some retinols can cause.  My skin felt and looked  great after just two weeks of use!</li>
    <li> ** I received this product in return for an honest review. All thoughts and opinions are my own.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The serum arrived quickly and was extremely well packaged in an amber glass bottle with a pump on top. Most of the other retinol serums I have tried have the eye dropper which is fine however I do find the pump quicker and more convenient. The serum itself is clear and has a watery gel like consistency with no smell. It goes on easily and has a nice cooling sensation. It also dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky or greasy feeling afterwards. Two pumps is more than enough for me to cover my face, neck and the backs of my hands. I use this product at night right before I got to bed. I wash my face, then apply toner, then this retinol serum and then finally finish up with a moisturizer. My face feels super refreshed after using this. I have noticed a big difference in the way that my skin feels after using this, Not only does it feel more refreshed I also noticed that it is much more hydrated since I don&#x27;t have to use nearly as much moisturizer as I did before. This is gentle on my skin, I have had no irritations or break outs from it and I have even started to notice that my skin tone is evening out and feels firmer! I am super pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Only used three times, and I can visibly tell a difference. I am using as more of a preventative treatment. I am approx. 30 years old and have predominant smile lines, as well as crows feet, so I bought this to use at night at tighten my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, so good! I&#x27;ve been using Olay Regenerist for months now, and this works so much better!</li>
    <li> All the positive reviews are fake. its easy to tell when &amp;#34;regular consumers&amp;#34; are all scientist that explain how each ingredient works to help skin. It&#x27;s all crap! This does not work, don&#x27;t know that I can&#x27;t trust any Amazon reviews now that I know (for sure with this product) that they are &amp;#34;influenced&amp;#34; to say the least. Trust me, I paid for this crappy product, it wasn&#x27;t given to me for my review!</li>
    <li> I am 34 with lines on my forehead and smile lines.  I used this product every night before bed.  The directions say for best results use with the vitamin C serum, did that too!  No results after 4 weeks not even a little.  There is no way this product has retinol in it!  Ussually products with less retinol in them with make your face red or peel a little but nothing.  All the great reviews sure fooled me! Very disappointed!  :(</li>
