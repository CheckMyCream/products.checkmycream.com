      <li>THE BRUSH IS CHEAP AMD FELL</li>

      <li>so when I bought this is was excited, hoping that it would work.</li>
      <li>After properly cleaning the bristles with solution before even the first use, I have to say I&#x27;m pretty impressed.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;d do better investing in a Mac 187 or a real techniques stippling brush!</li>
      <li>The first time I bought this brush I was so excited</li>
      <li>but I think it would be worth it.</li>
      <li>1 year later I&#x27;m still using them and their pretty nice and plump.</li>

      <li>i was excited when I received it, BUT, that ended shortly thereafter!  </li>
      <li>I thought the brush was going to be a little more sturdier but its doing the job.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried cleaning it and grabbing the brush in my hand to remove the fibers in case it was just because it was new.</li>
      <li>I like the brush especially because it didn&#x27;t cost me all that much on the down side the first couple of times I used it</li>
      <li>This is a poorly made product and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone even if it was free!</li>

    <li> This brush serves its purpose and that&#x27;s great it helps blend the foundation very nice but it&#x27;s thee worst at keeping the little bristles in. What I mean is it sheds a lot and leaves the little hairs on my face and I do not like that.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this brush! it was poorly made. A 2 year could have done a better job! The handle on the brush fell off as soon as i opened the pckg! Poor customer service as well!</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS IT IS SO CRAPPY ....THE BRUSH IS CHEAP AMD FELL APART THE FIRST TIME I USED IT....I was very upset n mad ....don&#x27;t waist ur money the ome at the dollar store lasted longer</li>
    <li> this brush sheds alot, after the 2nd use i thre it out and was very disappointed. I wouldnt recommend anyone buy this product. Play a little extra and get something else.</li>
    <li> I like the idea of the stippling brush however, the bristles are falling out by the bucket full and getting stuck in my foundation! So unattractive!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a stipple brush to apply foundation, but this brush makes a difference in application; it helps with my make-up in looking more even. Good brushed are hard to come by, as they have gotten so expensive. This one does the job!</li>
    <li> fell apart the first time I used it. You can get a bigger abs Better one at Walmart or ulta... it&#x27;s small. I didn&#x27;t return it because it we cheaper to keep the crap and throw it away. I should have read the reviews before buying. .. waste of money</li>
    <li> I order a bunch of these since it&#x27;s the best brush to use for a streak-free foundation application.

For the exception of very few fibers here and there falling out it was a good purchase.</li>
    <li> It was cheap so I guess you get what you pay for. Bristles coming out from the beginning and get on your face and makeup. Dissapointed</li>
    <li> the hair in this brush fall out constantly and get stuck to my face every time I use it. This brush is inexpensive, but invest in a good quality stippling brush</li>
    <li> If you are buying this brush for make up application, then save your money. After applying foundation with this brush, I had black little hairs all over my face. Needless to say, I was very disappointed!!!</li>
    <li> THE BRUSH WAS OK. IT WASN&#x27;T AS FIRM AS I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE. I REALLY WANTED SOMETHING TO REALLY BUFF MY FOUNDATION IN.</li>
    <li> This is brush is horribble it leaves bristles on your face and its a very cheap quality. I had to buy another one from bh cosmetics website cheaper than this and is excellent. This seller sent me a wrong shipment first and than the product itself is not product I would ever buy or recommend.</li>
    <li> Item is much smaller than picture looks. But it&#x27;s still a great price. It does the job. Should read mini stippling brush or trial size.</li>
    <li> I thought the brush was going to be a little more sturdier but its doing the job. I like the brush especially because it didn&#x27;t cost me all that much on the down side the first couple of times I used it the strands were coming off on my face. I little disappointed but it only happened like the fist 3 times I used it and now no strands come out. Good brush for the price.</li>
    <li> OMG I wish I would have read the other reviews on this product. The hair came off on my face and well that&#x27;s it. I tried to wash it to get the loose hairs out but that didn&#x27;t work!! This is a poorly made product and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone even if it was free!</li>
    <li> This brush might be cheap. You get what you pay for. This brush i threw away after a couple uses, sheds EVERYWHERE!</li>
    <li> I am not impressed with this brush, the hairs of the brush fall out as you use it.  When I was done applying make-up, I had black hairs all over my face.  I requested a return, but the postage to return it would be almost what I paid for the brush, so I might as well keep it.</li>
    <li> Flimsy brush, poorly made. This brush shed like crazy and it was trashed the same day after I tried it out! Save your money. You&#x27;d do better investing in a Mac 187 or a real techniques stippling brush!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a stippling brush for a long time so when I bought this is was excited, hoping that it would work. It works okay but the bristles fall off and get suck in the makeup that I just put on my face. I would recommend getting a better quality brush, it might be a little more pricey but I think it would be worth it.</li>
    <li> I should have read the other reviews before getting this brush. The first time I used it 15 hairs fell out of the brush and was matted to my face, so I washed it thinking it would help but it continues to fall apart. Please do not order!</li>
    <li> The first time I bought this brush I was so excited but when I got it! and used it for the first time.. ALOT of hairs fell out and stuck to my face and I tried washing and picking out all the hairs but NOTHING worked!! waste of money.</li>
    <li> i was excited when I received it, BUT, that ended shortly thereafter!  The brush sheds every single time I use it!!!</li>
    <li> I love the way it applies foundation. It is much better coverage than a generic sponge. But the brush leaves fibers all over my face. It&#x27;s very annoying. I&#x27;ve tried cleaning it and grabbing the brush in my hand to remove the fibers in case it was just because it was new. But it still leaves fibers on my face :( I will keep using it and revise my review if anything changes.</li>
    <li> Nice handle on the brush and like how the brush feels but I hate applying makeup with it because I end of with little hairs all over my face. This brush sheds..... A LOT.</li>
    <li> The fibers come out while applying make up.  I have to pick the fibers off of my face once I&#x27;m finished.  :(</li>
    <li> Hair from the brush falls out on your face.</li>
