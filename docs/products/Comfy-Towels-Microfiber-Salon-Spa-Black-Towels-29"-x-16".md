<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love using these for my curly hair. I washed them a few times with darks as instructed and have not had a problem with the color bleeding. I do wish they came in smaller count package since I didn&#x27;t need this many... I&#x27;ll be set for a long time!</li>
    <li> These towels are great</li>
    <li> This towels know how to soak up water.  Love them.</li>
    <li> Used to get towels from the normal salon suppliers but the usually run about $15-25 per dozen and they fall apart w/ in 6 months requiring to be replaced. This meant I needed to replace $100-150 every 6 months. Not really affordable. I cam across these by chance. THEY ARE AMAZING! I ordered 2 packs to test them and was amazed! NO BLEACH STAINS, FEW COLOR STAINS AND NO HOLES! They absorb an absurd amount of water  considering they are so thin and are a good size for even long hair clients. I replaced all our towels since I ordered the first 2 packs. Now all our towels are black and i don&#x27;t have to worry about separating the laundry or that the stylist use black towels for lightening hair (i do have to admit i have had only 2 towels show bleach stains but they are not that noticeable I can forgive it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was all the good, now for the bad. The only thing my stylists complain about are 2 things. 1st, they say the towels are to soft. Since they always have hands in water all day, their hands get rough and get stuck on the hands like velcro. I said use lotion. I bought lotion and leave it in the office and mixing room for them. The 2nd complaint (and I have to agree) is they are not heat resistant. Hot curling irons and flatirons crisp up the fabric. They are a poly nylon blend so I understand. I ended up getting heat mats for everyone and left it at that. It has less of a headache then to replace the towels or get more.</li>
    <li> Good quality, arrived earlier than I expected - Very good buy.</li>
    <li> My sister loves these for her salon!</li>
    <li> It is a very soft and well absorbent hair towel. It is a good size for short and medium hair length. I have heavy and medium hair length. It works perfectly for me.&lt;br /&gt;I used to wrap my hair with a long big regular towel which was so heavy and big for hair. It used to pull my hair from the front just because the towel was sliding towards back. This towel is just perfect size to wrap the hair after shower.&lt;br /&gt;I love how soft, gentle and absorbent the towel is. It is stain and shrink resistant. It comes in a nice packaging with some instructions on the back.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend reading the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;Like you wash other towel before using, wash this hair towel before use. Do not bleach this towel. It is ultra soft so you do not need to use fabric softener for this. The towels come in black, pink and white colors. It is recommended to wash colors one separately. In the machine it does leave its black color so be careful. Do not wash with other light color or white clothes/towels.&lt;br /&gt;The towel stays soft after many washes.&lt;br /&gt;The fabric has great quality. It is not very thick but has good absorbency.&lt;br /&gt;Over all it is a good towel. I would give it 5 stars because it is doing its work perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;I received this as a sample to try and give my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> Make sure to wash a couple times to make sure the black stuff all comes out!</li>
    <li> About to order some more right now!</li>
    <li> I received one microfiber towel free of charge from SalonGuys as part of their Market Research Program, and must admit that this has come as a lovely addition to my hair care needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve grown immense interest in learning how to better care for my hair and read that the less time hair is spent being dried by a hair dryer and styled with a flat iron, the healthier it will be in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After washing my hair, I would normally turban wrap it with a Turbie Twist (as seen on T.V. ...) and pat dry it accordingly before proceeding with the dryer. When I tried the microfiber towel in lieu of the Turbie Twist, I immediately noticed its superior absorbency as compared to the Turbie Twist. Not only is the microfiber towel super soft and fluffy, it does an excellent job in sucking out excess moisture from my hair - which ultimately lead me in exposing my hair to less drying heat, thus making the entire process faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only caveat is that, as another reviewer commented, the towel is not long enough to turban wrap it around your head. A longer length would have been greatly appreciated for better hair manageability (hence my minus one star), but I wouldn&#x27;t consider this a major concern given its absorbency level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, when reading another reviewer&#x27;s comment on the towel leaving \\&quot;black fuzzies\\&quot; on its first use, the shedding is minimized/virtually eliminated by washing twice before use (as stated on its care tag for best results).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, I would recommend this towel to anyone looking for vastly superior absorbency properties that a regular cotton towel can&#x27;t quite hold up to!</li>
    <li> Love these towels!!! I bought them for my salon and they truly are bleach &amp; stain resistant. I also love the fact that they absorbed a lot of the water without dripping everywhere which also reduces my drying time. I will be purchasing more once I&#x27;m done remodeling the salon.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, great quality towels! They are super soft, really absorbent, and look very professional. I will be buying more in the future.</li>
    <li> I love the towels but dissapointed in coloring. These last ones I bought were a lighter grey than the ones I had bought before.</li>
    <li> We received these towels super quickly. They are soft, color resistant and launder really well.  We are happy with our purchase.</li>
    <li> These towels are GREAT! They are a great size and really absorb water from hair very well. Would definitely recommend these to any one looking for a great salon towel!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ironic that the tag on this claims these are plush.  They are actually very thin although they are absorbent.  I&#x27;m not a fan of microfiber towels since they catch on my dry skin.  These are a good size for using for drying hair and even a quick clean up of your chair or counter.  Don&#x27;t believe that these are plush though.  If you want plush, move on.  If you don&#x27;t like microfiber because it catches on your dry hands, move on.</li>
    <li> Got this towel the other day in the mail and could tell right away that it was quality! I plan on using it as a camping/backpacking towel. It is super light and very absorbent!</li>
    <li> Wonderful little camping towels.</li>
    <li> Both my sister and I have really long, naturally wavy hair and bath towels just don&#x27;t cut it when it comes to towel drying but this microfiber towel is amazing.  The towel absorbs a lot of water and does so quickly so that I can get on with my styling routine.  The towels are really soft and after washing a few times separately the black color was set and I didn&#x27;t experience any issues with the color bleeding.  Since I&#x27;m quite fond of my waves I&#x27;m thrilled to have finally found a towel that absorbs the water without any wringing or rubbing which ultimately results in long flowing waves without the worry of flyaways or frizz.  Definitely a great addition to my hair care regimen that has led to healthier hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item was supplied to me at no cost in order to evaluate and share my experience. All opinions are 100% my own and they reflect my honest &amp; unbiased opinion. One may or may not have the same results as myself when using this product.</li>
    <li> I guess I&#x27;m a rebel because even though the directions said to wash this before use, I didn&#x27;t. Also, even though it says to wash it separately, I didn&#x27;t. I can&#x27;t afford to wash a single towel by itself and I wasn&#x27;t too keen on washing it by hand. So, I used it right out of the packaging and then later washed it with my regular wash load. I don&#x27;t regret either decision as I didn&#x27;t have any issues with it being too rough or stiff upon first use. I also didn&#x27;t notice any bleeding, and it didn&#x27;t ruin or damage any of the other items I had in the washing machine with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t say this is the softest towel I&#x27;ve ever felt (because it isn&#x27;t), but it certainly is the most absorbent. This really cuts down on the drying time of my thick, tightly curled hair. I usually use a t-shirt to dry my hair and even then I still have water dripping down my face and neck for an hour or two (I like to air dry). With this microfiber towel, so much water is absorbed that my hair is already about 75% dry when I take it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to wrap this towel around my head and leave it on for about 20 - 30 minutes. Surprisingly, it fits my head quite nicely. As I said, my hair is very thick and also puffy, so the fact that it fits nicely around my head is great. It&#x27;s very easy to secure it on my head and the texture helps to keep it in place (doesn&#x27;t move around). Water never drips down either when I have this on. I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest, unbiased review. All opinions are 100% mine.</li>
    <li> The towels attract lint pretty bad.</li>
    <li> Great price and great towels</li>
    <li> I received one of these towels complimentarily in exchange for my unbiased review.  Having long, thick hair and having two daughters in my house; one with long thick hair and the other with short thinner hair to say that I know about managing hair from day to day would be an understatement!  I&#x27;m always on the lookout for products that make managing the three heads of hair in my household easier or at the very least more enjoyable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the problems I come across is towels.  Between my eldest daughter who has long hair and my own long locks towels just don&#x27;t seem to cut it.  They get soaked through and heavy way too quickly to do any real good when it comes to drying.  Far too often when she or I take our hair down from the towel it&#x27;s still sopping wet and dripping.  While this towel isn&#x27;t big enough to be able to do the &amp;#34;flip, wrap, twist&amp;#34; turban like thing that many do with their bath towels unless you have shorter, thinner hair I still love these towels.  The microfiber wicks water away from the hair very quickly meaning that there&#x27;s less water left in the hair.  Finally no dripping from sopping wet hair down your back!  It also seemed to dry very quickly which is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first used this to dry my own hair last night after receiving it in the mail.  I was impressed at how much drier my own very long and very thick hair felt.  Next day I used it on my youngest&#x27;s hair (just below shoulder length, fine and thinner) before I got down to detangling it and styling it in preparation for Easter tomorrow.  It cut down the time it took me to blow dry her hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the time my eldest had emerged from the shower and was ready for me to get on her hair I had her use this towel to dry her hair as she waited for me to get down with drying and straightening her sister&#x27;s hair before I moved on to her.  Again it worked like a dream and wound up cutting down on blow drying time with her as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To boot the towel was only slightly damp by the time I finishes with my eldest&#x27;s hair!  Not that in a salon environment you&#x27;re going to use towels on multiple people or anything like that but within a household especially when you as mom have yourself and a couple of daughters you very well may use things like towels for hair from one kid to the next.  If you fit that bill and are like me consider investing in these towels.  The ten pack should be enough for most households especially if you have older children who may not want to share a towel for the purposes of drying hair or for styling.  If you&#x27;re more like me and have kids that don&#x27;t care or who are younger then get a pack and consider sharing with your family or friends who have daughters!  Would definitely make for a neat stocking stuffer for Christmas!ly damp by the time I finishes with my eldest&#x27;s hair!

    <li> Have been searching for the perfect microfiber towel. This is the one. If you are looking, you do not have to look no more. Very absorbing, very comfortable for the client, that couple extra inches in length helps go around the neck.</li>
    <li> As far as functionality, this is a wonderful towel.  It is soft as described and soaks up a lot of water.  I use it on my hair on a regular basis and it definitely absorbs more water than my traditional bath towel, and it is so much lighter to keep on my head!  The reason I gave it 3 stars was the fact that the towel is high maintenance.  The instructions said to wash it separately before use- so I hand washed it, and wow the black dye wouldn&#x27;t stop running out of the towel.  I was surprised that the towel was still black when I was done.  I am too afraid to wash it in my machine with other items. This is not practical in my world, I can&#x27;t be worried about a towel that &amp;#34;runs.&amp;#34;  If that doesn&#x27;t bother you, then this is a wonderful towel for you.</li>
    <li> This towel was nice to wrap one&#x27;s hair in after shampooing.  I would of liked it to be a bit bigger in size.  The microfiber worked well for water absorption, but also had the ability to keep hair somewhat damp before styling it.  It was also comfortable on the neck, for use under a styling cape but hair seems to adhere somewhat to the microfiber. Another issue is, it seems to &amp;#34;pick up&amp;#34; lint or material from other materials when washing then together.  One needs to do these towels with the same material towels and not mix loads.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves these towels! Drying her hair in the morning is SO much quicker! If it was slightly wider and longer, it would be ideal for wrapping one&#x27;s wet head. That&#x27;s the only reason it&#x27;s a 4-star vs 5. It&#x27;s super soft, super absorbent and very light weight. One reviewer indicated that &amp;#34;hair seems to adhere somewhat to the microfiber&amp;#34;.  I don&#x27;t have any problem like that. One reviewer commented &amp;#34;it seems to &amp;#34;pick up&amp;#34; lint or material from other materials when washing them together&amp;#34; - the instructions caution against washing with cottons and states that the towels need to be washed with like materials, which is only a drawback for personal use. For salon use, works perfectly!!  Try them!  You&#x27;ll love them!!</li>
    <li> Love microfiber towels.  I use them for dying my hair and drying them when I was my hair.  I like the fabric of this towel and it definitely helped to dry and take some of the moisture out of it, but I think it is too small.  Perhaps if I worked in a salon this would be better but using it at home the size just doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> These towels are soft and can be used for literally anything!! I use it for many things! Mainly washing my face. They&#x27;re salon towels but I don&#x27;t work at a salon, but I love soft towels. They&#x27;re soft and kinda squishy and they&#x27;re nice on the face or for drying hair! I think that these towels are also great for tanning. Putting them over the face so you don&#x27;t get burned is a great alternative to using them in a salon. You can obviously use towels for nearly anything but these are very soft and comfortable to use and they are not scratchy so I do recommend these yes.</li>
    <li> I ordered these to use on tires and wheels, because they are black and will not show the typical dirt picked up off of wheels and rims, and wasn&#x27;t expecting them to be as high quality as they turned out to be. I was pleasantly surprised when I opened them up and gave the a once over. Very nice microfiber towel. They are too good to be relegated to wheel and tire cleaning. Guess I will have to pull out the worst of my current MF towels for wheel and tire duty!&lt;br /&gt;They were priced very well, and were shipped and arrived quickly!</li>
    <li> Great light and wash well!</li>
    <li> these towels are great for cleaning. i use mine to dust and clean up around the shop. they can do the job of scrubbing and i can wash them like regular towels. they are black which is perfect for when i do hair color and are thick enough to where they wont drip seeping color onto my clients skin and they wont stain as easily as white towels. they just hold up better to washing it makes them look and feel cleaner longer. i even keep one in my car so i can dust or clean up any spills. they are also long enough to where they wont slip out from the drape when i work on a client. that&#x27;s the best because i have had littler towels and they just fall off because they aren&#x27;t wide enough to wrap around anything.</li>
    <li> These towels are perfect! I have only washed it a couple times but it seems like it will hold up just fine. The microfiber material soaks up so much water &amp; helps the hair dry a LOT faster which is super nice for my thick hair clients. The size is good &amp; I like that it&#x27;s black so color stains won&#x27;t show!</li>
    <li> I received one of these towels from SalonGuys as a part of a market research program. I have never bought a microfiber towel before so I can’t compare it to other microfiber towels. This one is very soft and absorbent. I tried it on the counter and it soaked up water nicely. I don’t know how much I’ll use it as a towel though because we are not particularly fond of black color, we prefer cheerful colors. The instructions also say not to wash it with other towels because it will have a lot of lint from regular towels. I find it a bit impractical because if I have to wash it separately, I’d have to have lots of these towels to do them all in one load. I think it can do a nice job of drying hair although it could be a bit larger if you wanted to wrap it around your head.</li>
    <li> I have never tried microfiber towels on my hair and using this product has me rethinking that.  This towel works wonders!  I found that this towel dries your hair faster than a regular towel would.  My mom worked in the hair salons and would always use paper towel or white towels that would stain.  Not this towel.  You don’t have to worry about stains of dye.  These towels work great and I would definitely recommend these to salon owners.</li>
    <li> These are nice microfiber towels that do a good job of soaking up the water from my wet hair when I get out of the shower. I really like the way that these feel, they are very soft feeling and seem extremely luxurious for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are the type of person that likes to wrap the towel around your head and tuck it in, I think these would work best for someone that has short to medium length hair. have extremely long hair, so I am unable to fit it all inside of just one towel, but I still use the towels just to hand scrunch the water out of the ends and that seems to work just as well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pack comes with 10 towels, and you will definitely want to be sure that you follow the instructions and wash them multiple times before use. Quite a bit of black dye will come out of them in the first few washes, but don&#x27;t worry because the towels will still be a nice dark black color. Make sure to wash the towels alone, or the black dye will come off and stain other items that they are washed with. I have washed them many times now and the dye no longer comes out, but I still wash them separately just to make sure they stay nice. I received a set to review and love them. I find myself using them daily now, they do a great job of absorbing moisture from my hair and really seem to cut down on my blow drying time.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used them yet since I&#x27;m still waiting to become certified but once I do, I&#x27;ll use them for professional services as a nail technician.&lt;br /&gt;But so far the quality of the towels look good to me.</li>
    <li> This is a good sized soft towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Soft&lt;br /&gt;- Large sized for the price&lt;br /&gt;- Soaks up liquid&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- The black color leaks. It might leak onto the face or onto other clothes. The instructions said to wash it separately before use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manufacturer sent me a free sample directly to review</li>
    <li> I wasnt able to find black towels this size in my country that worked well until i found these. They are good and the price is even better.</li>
    <li> Great towels. The best price too. I shopped around for a while and these were the best price with great quality.</li>
    <li> I am a fan of microfiber towels for cleaning, but I have never used them on my hair. So when I was asked to try one out, I was intrigued. The towel is not much larger than a hand towel. I have thick, shoulder length hair and upon seeing this towel, I had some doubts that it would even fit around my head. However, much to my surprise, it did fit! I was able to wrap my hair into a turban. I couldn&#x27;t tuck it into place, but I have some alligator styling clips on hand and was able to secure it in place with one clip. Microfiber towels are pretty thin, but this towel did an amazing job of absorbing the majority of the water that was left in my hair. I left the towel on for just 5 minutes or so, but when I took it off, I could immediately tell the difference compared to a regular towel. My hair was damp, but significantly drier than usual. As far as the black dye issue that I noticed in some of the other reviews, I must share my experience. I did not bother to wash the towel prior to using. I wasn&#x27;t wearing my reading glasses at the time &amp; could not read the instructions. So I used it without washing. I did not have any issues with black dye at all. Then after learning about those instructions, I took my towel and rinsed it in cold water. There was a little grayish color in the water, but no black water as described by some others. I have since washed it in the machine &amp; took care to wash it with similar colored items &amp; still no problems at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received one Salon Towel directly from the Salon Guys for the purpose of trying it out &amp; reviewing. My thoughts &amp; opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> The package came in really fast and exactly what my business needed. Thank you. We will come back!</li>
    <li> I use these for Hot yoga, gym towels and most importantly, my CURLY HAIR! They dry quickly and wash well.  Color didn&#x27;t bleed or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Handy pack of towels for sure.</li>
    <li> These towels are great!!! They have really made a huge difference in eliminating frizz from my curly hair.</li>
    <li> Microfiber towels gave me  excitement for a great quality for a good price . Length and fold out width are a little small but the micro fiber really helps nail Tech&#x27;s cut back on fuzzy in the polish..</li>
    <li> They are wonderful. They completely absorb water and they do so very quickly. I sure wish I had known about these before. I will be buying more for sure.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m providing this review of the black Comfy Towels from Salon Guys as part of their Market Research program.  I received the shipment on time and in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am generally not a fan of microfiber towels due to the way they feel after several washings, however; this towel has remained soft and has kept its shape after 3 washings (so far).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The towel is big enough to wrap around my daughters head if I secure it with a clip.  She likes the fact that its not big and heavy and she can easily move around with the towel.  Lightweight is a plus for our needs, and this towel hits the mark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on the positive experience with this product, I would definitely purchase a complete set of these towels.</li>
    <li> These towels are really nice.  They are a great size and shape for drying my hair.  They are really soft to the touch. They are also really absorbent, since they are a microfiber towel.  Overall, I really recommend these for what they are.  These really are a great value towel. They aren&#x27;t really big enough to use as a normal towel, but they are a great size for drying hair, since they are smallish and pretty light, but significantly larger than something like a hand towel.  So they are good for twisting up on your head after washing your hair as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not really happy about how the microfiber towels feel, however, all I&#x27;ve ever used is terry cloth.  It might just be a matter of getting used to something different, but I was immediately turned off by the way the material sort of snagged a little in my hands. It was almost as if the towel was being slid across course sandpaper - and no, my hands are soft and don&#x27;t feel like sandpaper!! LOL - but this is the best way to describe it.  I have glass tile walls and decided to clean them with this towel and I was happy with the results.  There was no streaking or lint, just a nice shine. I think my only complaint would be the way the towel feels in my hands. Otherwise, it absorbs and cleans very well.  I would recommend these towels to friends.</li>
    <li> The towels are of very low thread counts.  Very light weight and if you hold it up you can see lots of light passing through.  The cheap microfiber towels I got from Walmart is thicker and denser.</li>
    <li> These towel are really nice.</li>
    <li> I have been buying much more expensive microfiber towels for my salon.  These are basically the same towel for less.  Very pleased to have found them!</li>
    <li> I was provided with one of these microfiber salon towels as a product sample to evaluate, test, and share my opinion about as part of a consumer research study conducted by The Salon Guys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Measuring 16&amp;#34; x 29&amp;#34;, this black microfiber salon towel is soft, 4x more absorbent than cotton, and can endure far more wash cycles than cotton towels. They&#x27;re also stain resistant, won&#x27;t shrink, won&#x27;t fade, and dry in less than half the time it takes a standard cotton towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of those factors make these towels an excellent choice for salons since these towels will hold up better when coloring hair, allow their client&#x27;s hair to dry more quickly, won&#x27;t use as much energy when being cleaned, won&#x27;t show stains like lighter colored towels would, and are far more durable than cotton towels, making them a more economical choice for the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These salon towels should not be washed with cotton towels, and you do not use bleach or fabric softener with them. They need to be machine washed warm and by themselves, then tumble dried on low. Be sure to wash these several times before using them for client&#x27;s hair as they bleed a copious amount of black dye during washing and rinsing the first few times they&#x27;re washed!  That&#x27;s also an excellent reason for washing them separately as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Once they stop bleeding dye however, these towels are soft and definitely absorb water very well, so they should be very useful in the salon setting.  They could also be useful in a spa setting or for home use as long as enough were purchased to make it worthwhile to do a separate laundry load for the towels alone. 5 star performance, but 4 star on the bleeding dye and high maintenance the towels require.</li>
    <li> I received this towel in no time. According to the instructions wash the towel before use. I hand washed it with regular detergent and it didnt lose a lot of color. The towel fabric is soft and smooth. For sensitive skin it does not cause rashes or scars. The fabric does not leave lint behind either. I had a red towel and if I used a makeup wipe after using it I would notice red color on the wipe. I am glad that its not an issue with this towel. The size of the towel is 16 x 19 inches. The towel is super absorbent to be sued on hair as well.&lt;br /&gt;One thing I would recommend is a loop on either side of the towel so I can easily hang it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided without any obligations. Purchased on www.salonguys.com</li>
    <li> These towels are incredibly absorbent. I can&#x27;t wrap my hair, but I do manage to towel dry very nicely with these towels. They are soft enough to put under the baby when she is sleeping, and it helps her from breaking out badly in prickly heat when the humidity is up. I would have given them a 5 star review had they been bigger and I could wrap and tuck them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided by vendor</li>
    <li> I have been using these towels in my new salon and I absolutely love them. They are absorbent, soft and big enough for anything. They are color and bleach resistant. They do get lint on them if you wash with white or other colors. So make sure you wash them with like colors.</li>
    <li> I bought these for kitchen use. They&#x27;re great. Black doesn&#x27;t show dirt and they are more absorbent than kitchen towels.</li>
    <li> Great product, good price for the high quality you get. Fast Shipping! Overall pleased with my purchase and I highly recommend this salon towel product</li>
    <li> These towels are great! They are so absorbent and are perfect for soaking up all that extra moisture in hair before styling. I would highly recommend these for at home use and salon use.</li>
    <li> I love how absorbing theses towels are. I forgot to wash them more than once before I used them and they still soaked up the water. They are great. They don&#x27;t seem to grab and snag on things like most microfiber towels do either. They are a ten</li>
    <li> i needed cheap towels but good enough quality to use for bands we had in town for a festival.  held up to their roughness and were delivered on time!</li>
    <li> good absorbent towel - but way too small for long hair</li>
    <li> THESE TOWELS ARE SO PERFECT!! THEY ARE THE SOFTEST TOWELS KNOWN TO MAN, I WISH THEY WERE LONGER SO I COULD USE THEM FOR THE SHOWER. OTHER TOWELS LEAVE MY HAIR DRIPPING LIKE CRAZY, ESPECIALLY WHEN I&#x27;M UNDER THE STEAMER, BUT I DRIED MY HAIR WITH THIS TOWEL AND IT DIDN&#x27;T DRIP AT ALL. I&#x27;M DEFINITELY GONNA TRY TO BUY MORE!! THANKS!!!</li>
    <li> love these will tell people to buy</li>
    <li> The towels are in my opinion too small for me.  I couldn&#x27;t even wrap it around my head like a normal towel.  It&#x27;s more of a hand towel size.  I ordered these towels because it was suggested that they will reduce frizz.  They absorb water well, but pinch my hair which I don&#x27;t like.  I think if anything these towels cause more hair friction because they catch the hair.  My regular towels don&#x27;t do that.  I&#x27;ll keep them, but I&#x27;ll probably just use them on the car, on the dog and for house hold cleaning instead.  I&#x27;ll stick with my regular bath towels.</li>
    <li> I am using these towels at the gym.  They are great towels to use during workouts.</li>
    <li> I was sent a towel from Salon Guys for review. After using it for a few days now, I decided to rate it 4/5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product claims that it is durable, soft, has fast absorbancy, and dries faster than a cotton towel. I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 days now, and I think for the most part, the product is true to its claim. I&#x27;ve been using the microfiber towel mostly on my face (i.e. washing my face masks off or applying facial scrub). The towel does feel soft and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin when I use it to wipe off my face mask. I found the more textured side of the towel great for gently scrubbing my face. I have noticed that it does dry faster than my cotton towels, but the microfiber towel is also a lot lighter and smaller than my cotton towels. I can&#x27;t speak to its durability because I&#x27;ve only had it for a few days and have not washed the towels yet, but the product does claim that its 6x more durable than cotton towels. I can say that for the few days I have been using it, I haven&#x27;t noticed any shedding. Cons about the product so far is the towel length. I agree with the other reviewers in that the towel is an odd length. Its too long to use as a face towel but its not long enough to wrap my hair with the towel. I can see why people would recommend it as a gym towel because its quick drying and lightweight. Bottom line, I think its a standard microfiber towel that does function for its intended use (high absorbancy and soft to use for face and body) and would recommend it to anyone who just wants a simple and affordable set of comfy towels.</li>
    <li> SalonGuys sent me one of these to review, and though i&#x27;m not a fan of microfiber, these towels measured up well. They are very absorbent and soft, but also have the tendency to \\&quot;stick\\&quot; to rough or calloused hands. They do wash well, and look professional in appearance. They work great as a wash/buffing cloth as well. I would buy these.</li>
    <li> This is a good product. Its soft, absorbs well. Easy to clean. Its good for any type of salon use, and should last a long time if washed correctly.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful microfiber towel, it truly is salon quality and it works like a charm. The towel is super comfortable and very nice looking. The material allows it to soak up water so it is perfect for days when I am rushing out of the shower to get ready for school or work. I wrap my hair in it and do my morning routine by the time I am ready to go my hair is dry and looking good. The quality is outstanding and I just love it. You do need to wash it by itself before use but after I just wash it with my normal towels and it has been fine. I really appreciate salon guys sending me a sample for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> These towels are perfect for curly hair, and way better AND cheaper than the other microfiber towels that you can find online!</li>
    <li> Great towels, super absorbent. They&#x27;re excellent to soak up excess water from your hair, but they&#x27;re also perfect for cleaning. Love these!</li>
    <li> As a salon owner, these towels are great! And the cost is very reasonable.</li>
    <li> I bought these towels to use when i do hair. They are the perfect size and very soft and absorbent. I will be buying more of these towels to stock up on. The price is right too! I did a lot of review reading, and I was pleasantly surprised with these.</li>
    <li> Great micro towels for staying cool. Just soak in water place around shoulders or neck during exercise.</li>
    <li> I needed a mid sized towels to wrap my hair after was washed. This size was perfect.</li>
    <li> these are the best towels I have ever owned. not only are they soft and feel so good against your skin they are made very well. I hope to get years of use out these salon towels. after I received these,  I ordered more. now all I have are microfiber towels, hand towels and washcloths. microfiber is all that I have in my bathroom cabinet. I threw out the cotton towels. not only are they durable but they take less laundry detergent and no more fabric softener up against my sensitive skin. next is working on bedding products that are made out of microfiber. out with the old in with the new.</li>
    <li> I received one towel for testing and reviewing purposes.  The towel turns nice and soft once you wash it.  It really absorbs water so my hair dries out quickly.  It is large enough for me but if you have lots of curly hair, it might not.  The towel however requires special care.  It does bleed when washed.  It is amazing how much it bleeds yet, the towel still stays black.  I am currently using a special detergent for darks but I am concerned to put it in the washer with other clothes that are not completely black.  This towel will have to be washed by itself all the time until it quits bleeding - not sure when that will be.  Good towel but not very practical care.</li>
    <li> First of all- FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS! These need to be washed before using to rid them of any excess dye and to get them all fluffy. You must remember, these are salon towels- they are designed to be washed in a big wad with like towels. If you throw these in with your colors there WILL be bleeding the first few go rounds. What these are intended for is for salon style use- keeping shoulders dry during hair washing (they do a FANTASTIC job- unlike traditional towels, these are incredibly absorbent and don&#x27;t soak through to your/your client&#x27;s clothing). They also protect clothing from dye drips (see attached photo) and are the perfect size for protecting you without being a big, bulky full sized towel.</li>
    <li> These towels are soft on faces, large enough to wrap long hair in after a shampoo and very absorbent. I love how soft they are. I&#x27;d recommend use for cosmetologist and estheticians or anyone wanting better than ordinary towels for home facial use.</li>
    <li> These microfiber towels work very well for towel drying my hair before using the blow dryer. The towel was excellent at removing moisture from my hair, even with my hair longer than the towel. They towels are longer than others I have, which is nice and worked well for wrapping the towel around my hair. The quality is very nice and thicker than the other microfiber towels that I have previously purchased. For the price and quality, these towels are an excellent buy. When I am in need of more microfiber towels these will be on the top of my list.</li>
    <li> I am providing this review as part of a market research program.  I like microfiber towels and use them regularly.  It is generally recommended that you wash microfiber towels separate from cotton towels.  The tag recommended these were washed twice before using so I did that. What I didn’t like is that the color “black” came out in the wash and dyed my other towels that are now discolored.  Based on the list price these are $3 each and the discounted Amazon price makes them under $2.  That is a great price for these towels.  They absorb as well as my others.  Just be careful to wash them a few times without anything else.</li>
    <li> We actually bought these towels to use in our exercise room.  They&#x27;re very absorbent and work very well for our needs.  We had microfiber towels that were half the size, but they weren&#x27;t quite big enough.  These are just the right size.  Easy to fold and store.</li>
    <li> My hair is damaged from coloring and gets snagged on my cotton bath towels. It&#x27;s a huge pain because my hair takes a long time to dry, even with a hair dryer, if I don&#x27;t towel dry it first. I had heard that microfiber towels are better for drying damaged hair, so I gave this towel a try after a shower. Well, it works. It did not snag or tangle my hair AT ALL and also absorbed water very quickly. The towel itself seems to dry out quickly, which is great because I don&#x27;t want damp towels hanging around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I deducted one star because the towel did shed some black fuzzies on its first use, though since then it has not shed at all. I also wish it was a bit larger--I was hoping I could turban wrap my hair in it, but it is simply not big enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, definitely a good towel for smoothly drying hair, and it probably has some other great uses as well.</li>
    <li> These are as described--I just sort of hate the feel of them. I suppose all microfiber is like that. If you don&#x27;t mind that, then these are the towels for you.</li>
    <li> My towels shippef quickly and were packed with care. Next time I will buy more and will look to get the larger towels. I will continue to buy from them:)</li>
    <li> These towels worked great for our clients. They are durable and easy to care for. We would purchase again for our clinic.</li>
    <li> I received some of these Comfy Microfiber towels from Salon Guys as part of their market research program. After trying them out for a bit, I found that they are a great size, small enough to work with easily and long enough to wrap around the neck under a cape or around the head after washing. When I first got them wet the water slid off, which I was concerned about, but I washed these before using them on anyone and they turned out to be very absorbent. They are also soft enough not to be abrasive against the skin; they actually feel quite nice even on my face. They have a good edging to keep them from fraying, which some of my towels have done in the past. They are a great value as well, cheaper than some alternatives I&#x27;ve looked at (and my old towels) but with a great quality for the price. They are also well-made and seem to hold up under multiple washings. I will definitely be making the switch to these towels.</li>
    <li> These are the best microfiber towels! They are nice a big! I am a hairdresser and black is the best option for using color. They are soft and soak up water like crazy!</li>
    <li> This towel is bigger than your average handtowel. I don&#x27;t find it very soft, but as far as microfiber towels go, it&#x27;s really absorbent. It&#x27;s definitely not as thick as your average microfiber towel either, so it folds into a smaller space, but also isn&#x27;t as plush. It does seem well-lined so you shouldn&#x27;t expect it to fray or get raggedy at the ends. Definitely a good choice for a daily beauty routine, since it&#x27;s pretty durable. As some of the other reviewers mentioned, it does tend to pick up lint and stray hairs. I prefer that towels are a bit softer, so it gets a solid three (wish I could do 3.5) stars.</li>
    <li> Comfy towel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Microfiber towels all the time.  I have different ones that I dust with.  But these especially are nice for drying my hair. Love the feel of this towel.  It is a must to follow directions to wash before using.  Reason 1 is to get the extra dye out.  It is a pain to wash them separately since it doesn’t make a full load, but you wouldn’t want dye on your other towels.  Reason 2 is so the towel becomes absorbent, after a wash they were fully absorbent and great for towel drying my hair after washing.  I saw other reviews about not being able to wrap it around your head, that’s true, but you don’t wear it as a turban in a salon after they wash your hair. They towel dry your hair and wrap it put it on the back of your neck.  I like it for home use as I use 2 towels after the shower, 1 to dry my hair.  Now I don’t have to use a full size towel, just my Comfy Microfiber Towel!</li>
    <li> Towels are perfect. We needed them to dry our glass shower walls/door as our water is so hard that if spots and leaves hard water stains that destroy the clean look, and could be permanent without drying. Perfect for the job.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> Amazing towels. Amazing price. Use them for hot towel shaves and they get the job done. Completely satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:bfcb80e8555de4e2fc16a2b5fbed1806]] Today, we&#x27;re unboxing Comfy microfiber salon towel.  This product was provided to me by Comfy Towels.  They&#x27;re 80% polyster and 20% polyamide with microfiber material.  I always prefer microfiber for towels because they feel soft, absorb liquid well, and are better at picking up dirt.  Testing it out by dripping water on my hands, wrist, and watch, the towel dries off very well.  It would work well at home for hair and body care.  It&#x27;s soft and it&#x27;s also a nice large size.  I highly recommend comfy towels for people who want great microfiber towels in their home.</li>
    <li> These towels are very soft.  They are able to really soak up water from wet hair.  They would be perfect for salon or Home use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can not yet comment on durability as I have only had it for a few days. IT feels as though it will last through thousands of washes, yet it has a very pleasant feel and is extremely absorbent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The black color is a great idea as to not become stained when drying newly colored hair.  Not to mention that black goes with decor and colors.</li>
    <li> I thought these towels worked great for drying my hair.  They helped to speed up my drying time.  The black color is great for me as I have ruined so many towels with hair dye stains.  The only thing I find to be a pain about this particular microfiber is that when you wash and dry them with other cotton items or towels, dry hairs become embedded in the towels.  They can only be washed with other microfiber items. Supposedly this is the case with all microfiber, but it does not happen to me with my microfiber Turbie Twists.  I think I will stick with using the Turbie Twists on a regular basis and only use these during the times that I color my hair.  I do not have the energy to frequently wash them separately.</li>
    <li> I received a sample towel from The Salon Guys and I love it! I was a little leery at first because the towel was soaked while it was on my head. The reason was it really did absorb a lot of the water from my hair. I have long hair and it was big enough to wrap my hair up in it. I only have one of these but will probably buy some more when I get the extra money. Just wish they were a little cheaper however I really do not know the going rate for microfiber towels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that the towel is soft and comfy. I have not washed it as of yet but it does seem sturdy and like it will hold up in the wash.</li>
    <li> These microfiber towels are great.  Microfiber is definitely the way to go!  I have found that it is more absorbent that traditional terry cloth towels and, best of all, it does not leave lint fuzzies all over the floor.  I have below the shoulders long, thick hair and I wrap my hair in one of these towels with a clip immediately upon exiting the shower.  It does a fantastic job of not only getting out all of the dripping water, but also going a long way towards actually drying my hair.  These towels are also good for general wiping up, as they don&#x27;t leave lint all over the counters.  Highly recommended overall.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair that has a fairly involved care regimen when it comes to washing, conditioning, caring for and styling it. A big part of it is using microfiber towels to quickly absorb the water without creating frizz the moment I step out of the shower. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different brands and have gathered quite a collection over the years. This one might be one of my favorites. It&#x27;s thirsty and does a really fabulous job of soaking up the water without a lot of manual wringing and squeezing around the hair that often leads to frizz. I was able to just wrap my ends in the towel and let it sit there for a moment absorbing while I assembled my next step. My hair was ready to go by the time I moved on to blow drying. Sleek results!</li>
    <li> Salon Guys sent me one towel as a sample to review this product and I was really glad to get the opportunity to try it out because I&#x27;ve recently been looking in to the whole idea of microfiber towels. These towels are a great size for drying your hair and they are even a little longer than what I expected which is great for draping around the shoulders. I was impressed that it came with very clear instructions on how to care for the microfiber towel particularly when it comes to laundering because that really gives you the opportunity to get the longest use out of your towels. It is absorbent and drys quickly and I would definitely consider purchasing an entire set.</li>

    <li> Great hair drying towels for long hair.&lt;br /&gt;Good price!</li>
    <li> Before using and testing this towel I made sure to follow the directions and was it first.  This product is for different salon uses.  It is not meant to be a hair towel that you twist your hair up in.  After reading the 1 star reviews I see that they did not read before they purchased this product.  This towel  is 16&amp;#34; x 29&amp;#34; great for many uses and very absorbent.  It did not shrink in the wash and became a little more fluffy and soft.  It also dries faster than a cotton towel.  It is perfect for covering your shoulders while dying your hair because it is stain resistant (even though I have the black).  Great for when doing your nails or even wiping off your dogs wet paws.  Many uses and good quality.&lt;br /&gt;Sample Provided for review</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a salon owner and I wouldn&#x27;t use any other towel besides these. The microfiber is soft and very good for your hair and especially for curly hair clients. Much cheaper to buy here than the supply house!</li>
    <li> perfect for drying curly hair! Love that they are black so I can use them after dying my hair without worry</li>
    <li> Great product,ordered more, though price went up $3 in a month,s time, hence the 4 stars</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s compact enough to tuck into your pocket; absorbant enough to last the whole night dancing; black color is really great for style.</li>
    <li> Super soft, great for color work and blotting curly hair and my client like them so much they are asking for them!</li>
    <li> Good size, quality soft material.</li>
    <li> These towels are great!  I got some for my parents in Mocha, and now I want a set for myself but they&#x27;re not offered in that color anymore.  I hope they&#x27;ll come back soon.  These are the perfect size to use as hand towels around the house, as well as for a salon, and microfiber is good for drying hair.  Great towels at a great price.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re great and big</li>
    <li> perfect towels for use in our salon.  Another stylist had purchased these at a local store and they have held up wonderfully.  They are still black after almost a year of use and washing.  They have resisted all stains and bleach.  We do find they dry the hair very well.  We will order more of these.</li>
    <li> Perfect...so very soft...great job</li>
    <li> They feel a little scratchy</li>
    <li> I often shower right before work and hate going in with my hair still wet. Comfy Towels microfiber salon towels help dry my hair quicker than I thought a towel could!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Microfiber is great for cleaning and drying my car, but I never thought it would work well for my hair! The same moisture-wicking qualities I enjoy in my car towel are at play here and this towel literally sucks the water out of my strands. This towel is so soft and the perfect size to throw over my shoulder on my way into the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This towel does require a bit of upkeep, but in my opinion it&#x27;s nothing extraordinary. By running it through the washing machine alone at first like the instructions suggest I was able to deal with the dye running as other reviewers have mentioned. These towels are best kept together with other black microfiber items in the wash, which is proper laundry technique in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very impressed in the quality I found in my Comfy Towel microfiber salon towel! I did receive a sample of this product but price doesn&#x27;t change how absorbent it is, nor does it effect my review,</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:44fe59c7e6dd00bdab4851ba612ac8d]] These Comfy Black Microfiber Salon Towels are great for many things but I love using them to dry my hair! Having long thick hair these work 10 times better then any bath towel on the market. These are soft and very absorbent towels that hold a lot of water. They are great for coloring hair because these are stain resistant. They come with instructions that say you need to wash them before you use them. I suggest you wash them a few times in the sink to get all that extra dye out before you wash them with anything else. I have found that with any of the salon towels that you buy they are always full of dye something to do with the stain resistance chemical used so I have been told. I never wrap these towels around my head instead I hang my head upside down and I wrap my hair only. They are 29 inches long so they are the perfect length to wrap all of my hair that hangs from my head and soak up all that extra water. With out these towels it would take nearly 45 minutes to dry my hair. Watch my video for my full review. I received these in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:16036de296776854182669520d2807f2]]After reading previous reviews one of the first things I did was hand wash the towel so I wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about any issues with the dye bleeding...and oddly enough I had almost no bleeding from the dye.  In fact, had I not been looking for it I&#x27;m not sure I would have even noticed that their was just a little bit of bleeding.  I washed them by hand for a few minutes and after that they were totally fine, no bleeding of the dye at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love these towels!  I have really thick curly hair and these are so much better for drying my hair.  I wasn&#x27;t sure it would be big enough because I have such thick hair, but if I use a clip to hold it in place, the towel is the perfect length and it&#x27;s so much more comfortable than using a big heavy cotton towel.  They&#x27;re also far more absorbent than cotton towels, so it definitely cuts my drying time down quite a bit.  These are great towels for both home and professional use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Love them for my salon very soft and nice..</li>
    <li> This very soft towel is excellent at soaking up all the excess water out of hair. It makes it so much easier to dry hair and cuts down on the time under the hair dryer. It&#x27;s comfortable and easy to wash. It&#x27;s obviously made out of quality material.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a little small for personal use. I would have like a slightly bigger size so I could wrap my hair in it like a turban style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a complimentary product for review. No compensation was given. All opinions are my own.**</li>
    <li> would not recommend , nail dust sticks to it. towels are not soft.</li>
    <li> I use these towel primarily for yoga. They wash well, highly absorbent, and are super soft. Excellent value!</li>
    <li> The towels were really small and thin, way too small to wrap around your head..  I didn&#x27;t care for them at all.  However, the company was accommodating when I decided to return them, especially since it was my fault for not paying better attention to the length.</li>
    <li> Great buy! Doesn&#x27;t stain when using hair color or bleach</li>
