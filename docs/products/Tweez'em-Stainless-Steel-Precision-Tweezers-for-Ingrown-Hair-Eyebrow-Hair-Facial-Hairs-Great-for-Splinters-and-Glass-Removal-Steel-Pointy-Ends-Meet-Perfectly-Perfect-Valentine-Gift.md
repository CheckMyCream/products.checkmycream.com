<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this for hairs or splinters, but to adjust and pick up tiny glass pieces and seed beads for the mosaics that I create. It works perfectly for crafting.</li>
    <li> wanted a sharper point</li>
    <li> Horrible. They won&#x27;t grasp hairs at all. Stick to the real tweezerman ones. These are so flimsy in comparison. They aren&#x27;t even worth my time and money to send back. Don&#x27;t waste you money!!!</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s a sharp lip that turns up on the side of a tweezer. Doesn&#x27;t tweeze anything, just cuts the hair in half. Poorly manufactured.</li>
    <li> ✔ PERFECT FOR SPLINTERS - Are you a magnet for splinters? Do you encounter splinters, debris, thorns, glass, metal, and other things embedded in fingers, hands, feet and legs? These stainless steel tweezers are perfectly aligned, hand filed calibrated and sharp tips that close evenly for smooth maneuvering around almost invisible splinters!&lt;br /&gt;•✔ INGROWN HAIRS AND EYEBROW HAIR- They are not just good for those troubled ingrown hair, but also for precision eyebrow plucking. They pick up smallest individual hair that standard tweezers would not be able to get to.&lt;br /&gt;•FIRST AID-Important tool to have in any first aid kit. Keep one in your medicine cabinet and one for your toolbox.&lt;br /&gt;•Can be used in conjuction with your preferred method of hair removal&lt;br /&gt;•LIFETIME GUARANTEE try the TWEEZ&#x27;EM risk free. We honor our no hassle lifetime guarantee so if you are not satisfied, contact us and we will give you a full refund or a replacement&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Super sharp, very well aligned, and the coating makes it easy to hold without slipping. Highly recommended tweezers for removing splinters!</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised when I opened this inexpensive pair of tweezers, and found that it was as well-made - if not better - that any pair of tweezers I have ever seen, including ones by Tweezerman.  The points are sharp, the metal strong, and it comes in a case.  What more could one ask for?</li>
    <li> I use this product for my facial hair and it works incredibly well. The pointed tips allow you to dig out splinters and ingrown hairs alike. I thought about buying the name-brand product for twice the cost but I am glad that I did not.</li>
    <li> Tweezers and nail clippers disappear in my household. I can never find a pair when I need them. I was anxiously awaiting the arrival of this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only had one other pair of tweezers that worked this well. The tip is very sharp but it allows you to get a good grip on anything. Got a stay hair, bee sting, splinter this set of tweezers rocks it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the packaging for this pair of tweezers. It comes with a protective plastic tip cover which allows you to keep it with other beauty brushes, in a makeup kit or even in my overnight bag, without getting stuck. The tip of the tweezers is very sharp and I do recommend that you keep them out of the reach or grip of little ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bright yellow color of the tweezers make them very easy to find and after using them twice in two days they are easily one of my favorite products. Want the good news? These are easily a bargain at only $9.95 on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are made out of stainless steel so they should hold up well over the years. Even better since in my household they will definitely get used often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Majestic Bombay certainly knew what they were doing when they designed this pair of Tweez’em Stainless Steel Tweezers. I would not hesitate to recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided at no cost for an honest product review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2cents@40 does not get monetary compensation to review all products.

    <li> The Tweez’em Stainless Steel Tweezers are the best i have owned! I usually buy the cheap tweezers… You know, the ones that never seem to get all of your eyebrow hair and if it does it just breaks off. The day i got my Tweez’em Tweezers i used them right away because my eyebrows were hideous! I pulled out my zoomed in mirror (is what i call it) and i started plucking away. Since i was seeing everything in a zoom setting, i noticed that my hairs were coming out with a little ball on the end. Not even thinking, my first thoughts were. “WHAT IS THAT?” Then i started looking more and thought.. That is my hair root. I couldn’t believe that it was even pulling that deep. So now that i have perfect eyebrows, i don’t have to worry about them growing in so fast. These tweezers are amazing. They are also great for splinters, first aid needs and ingrown hairs. I received this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> This little pointy tweezer gets everything!</li>
    <li> This is about the best tweezer I have bought. Tried many but this one is the best that I have used.</li>
    <li> Super sharp, very well aligned, and the coating makes it easy to hold without slipping. Highly recommended tweezers for removing splinters!</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with eyebrows and have found these to be the best tweezers I&#x27;ve even owned. Using a 5X magnifying mirror, I can get those stray hairs that are difficult to remove with a slant-point tweezer. Also, they would be good to remove a splinter, but fortunately, I haven&#x27;t needed them for that.</li>
    <li> These tweezers do exactly what they advertise. I&#x27;m very prone to ingrown hairs, and my kids get plenty of splinters.  These tweezers help me to get anything out quickly and without grabbing extra skin around the area.  I would definitely purchase these tweezers again if I ever lost this pair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as a heads up to users with hard floors: the tips, because they are so fine, bent when I accidentally dropped them on a tiled bathroom floor.  (Of course they landed tip down.)  I was able to gently re-bend them and they still work perfectly, it would just be a good idea to be extra vigilant to not drop them.</li>
    <li> These are some of the best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever owned. I have had them for about five months now and they are still holding up great.</li>
    <li> This tweezer is sent from some lot of divine, hairless gods. I&#x27;ve gone through a lot of tweezers but all pale in comparison to this brand. The steel tip is perfectly sharp and once you pluck it&#x27;s extremely effective to pull out all those unwanted hairs. They also work as a helpful tool such as picking out splinters, delicate crafting and so forth. The price is affordable and I have two as backup so that I don&#x27;t freak out if I lose one.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find these fine point tweezers in any stores I shopped. The quality is excellent and at a very reasonable price. Prompt delivery and confirmation was great.</li>
    <li> I sent these back.  They were not sharp enough to clasp onto a hair in order to pull it.  I was comparing to the great quality of Tweezerman.</li>
    <li> They worked like a charm and came in the 2 days (yay prime)!</li>
    <li> Great product. Timely delivery.</li>
    <li> The tweezers was perfect...exactly what my daughter wanted.  Works well.  Buying experience was super.  Received the product on time and packaged well.</li>
    <li> Wow!! I get ingrown hairs on my bikini area no matter what I do before, during or after shaving. I always get an ingrown or two. Gentle ways to remove ingrown hairs never work for me and if I leave them be they will just stay there and not work themselves out. Literally. Lol. Anyway, I always have to go in and get them which took about 5 minutes a hair using a needle or normal tweezers which can be uncomfortable and irritating to my skin not to mention the affected area itself. I had four this time (don&#x27;t ask lol) and I was able to remove all of them in 2 minutes without any pain. I took a warm bath and exfoliated to soften the area. I got out and patted my skin dry, cleaned the tweezers and was able to simply just remove the hair trapped under the skin without having to end up pulling the whole hair out by the root to get it out. Very effective and gentle. No redness, irritation or discomfort. I love these! Tip: If you are removing more than one at a time be sure to clean the tweezers between each one and clean them and the area before and after removing them. I wish I knew about these a long time ago!</li>
    <li> Perfect for removing ingrown hairs. More precise than the cheap pairs you will find in drug stores.</li>
    <li> Great Product!  Great Seller!</li>
    <li> Quality tweezer, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Not great for really gripping things, but quite precise.</li>
    <li> These are great! I am really particular about getting even very short hairs around my eyebrows, and these allow for that precision. Just make sure you keep the protective plastic tip that comes with the tweezers - they are pokey on your fingers when you are looking for them in a drawer!</li>
    <li> I have purchased multiply items and haven&#x27;t had any problems. Great products and fast shipping.  Will be buying from them again.</li>
    <li> Works prefect for getting ingrown hairs out. Havent had an issues purchase.</li>
    <li> The only downside to these tweezers is that they seem to break off my hair. Maybe it has something to do with my grade of hair. When I try to pull the ingrown hair out I end up fighting with it. So, I use this first then use another pair to pull. I know, even though, you&#x27;re not supposed to pull out ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> Love these!  They get those stubborn hairs that just dont want to come out.</li>
    <li> A nice alternative to Tweezerman. I give 4 out of 5 stars only because they are not quite as sharp as the Tweezerman option; but, they are getting the job done.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised with the Tweez&#x27;em tweezers ordered from Majestic Bombay. The tweezers are of a good quality. But I was also pleased with the warm notices from the company apprising me of their attempt to et the product to me as quickly as possible. If I have an opportunity to order other items from Majestic Bombay, I will.</li>
    <li> Probably some of the worst tweezers I&#x27;ve ever purchased.&lt;br /&gt;The grip isn&#x27;t that great and felt like I was digging at spots that shouldn&#x27;t have required that much effort. My 5 year old tweezers pull hair better than these. Not recommending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Edit]&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, I have to rate these a 1 star (downgrade from 2 star). These are seriously the worst tweezers I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve been sitting here attempting to use. If you push, you can hear a part of the tweezers &#x27;click&#x27; -- what is that? There are no slats really to grab anything... it&#x27;s really hit or miss.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t even want to put in the effort to return these. I just decided to purchase another set. Biggest disappointment.</li>
    <li> Waste of money. These don&#x27;t grasp hair, they just advance carpal tunnel syndrome.</li>
    <li> This tool is very useful! It came in a timely manner and the sellers are very nice!</li>
    <li> Ingrown hairs hurt and look horrible.  These are great at removing them. They are very sharp so be careful with them. Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> fast service and exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> def a good tweezer to have if you have ingrown hair. the tip is narrow and pointy and has a better grip than the other tweezers I have tried. yellow is also a pretty color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it comes well packaged.</li>
    <li> Not very good for ingrown hairs. They don&#x27;t grasp as well as other, pricier, tweezers I have.</li>
    <li> I just love these tweezers! They are sleek and they definitely do the job! I bought them for my woodshop teacher and obviously working with wood caused him to get many splinters. Bought these bad boys for him and he says he loves them!</li>
    <li> Great quality tweezer. Very precise, allows to pull the hair easily without pinching skin.Great product.</li>
    <li> Very sharp and are able to dig in and grab ingrown hairs very well. Seems to be very good quality.</li>
    <li> Very great for pulling out splinters! I have been keeping this in my pocket for a long time now and bring it with me anywhere i go.</li>
    <li> Percission, high quality tool.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are AMAZING!  They get the job done every time with minimal poking or searching.  I like how smoothly they pull hairs out of my legs.  My husband loves using it on his face for those pesky ingrown beard hairs. I would highly recommend these as an accompaniment to your normal tweezers.  Great product!</li>
    <li> The tweezer I purchased are excellent. Thr quality is tops. I will be a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> I was debating between these and the (seemingly identical) &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; version (whose brand name I wasn&#x27;t actually familiar with since it&#x27;s tweezers we&#x27;re talking about here). I went with these mostly because I am cheap at heart, and luckily it paid off well this time. These are very nice tweezers; very sharp, and well aligned. They do everything you could ask of a tweezer, which is to say the only thing you ever ask of your tweezers, and they do it much better than the standard shape that we are all used to. If (when) I lose these I will be buying them again.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and as pictured. Great useful tool!</li>
    <li> Extremely acurate, great for ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for tweezers for some time now that are easy to use. Not so much for just ingrown hair, but other things like ingrown toenails and such.</li>
    <li> This item was to replace a tweezerman tweezer that bent...&lt;br /&gt;It works okay but not as i have experience with the other more expensive trade -off.&lt;br /&gt;will still buy the more expensive tweezer...</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re ever so slightly off alignment; they still function but you can see the drift. The tips aren&#x27;t as sharp as I thought they&#x27;d be; they seem a little hammered down.  I have a set of tweezerman slant tweezers and they&#x27;re sharper at their points than this is, if you grasp too tightly the tip will deform, i&#x27;m probably being to rough on them though. But i&#x27;m going to be sending these back I think.</li>
    <li> Definitely not what I was hoping for. The ends are much larger than pictured. Also the ends aren&#x27;t even the same. One is almost are fine tipped as I might expect but the other is probably 3x the size. Obviously a lack of quality control. I guess j shouldn&#x27;t expect much for the price tho. They&#x27;re too cheap to waste my time with returning them so I&#x27;ll buy the more expensive ones on here and throw these in the garbage.</li>
    <li> Returning these.  Hair slide right through no matter how hard I grasp. Poorly aligned.</li>
    <li> We love this tweezers!  We have used it to get out the tiniest of slivers, but it&#x27;s also very strong and has removed big thorns as well.  Comes in a nice case too.  We highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Next time I will buy the real deal and not the off  brand one.&lt;br /&gt;You get what you payed for.</li>
    <li> Over the years, I have acquired quite a few tweezers and these are honestly the best to date.  The sharp point grasps the hair and allows for even the toughest or finest hairs to be successfully plucked.  My brows have never looked this good!</li>
    <li> These are unequivocally the best tweezers I&#x27;ve purchased. The product is top-notch: there is a substance to the item, the weight and size absolutely perfect. The tips are sharp and grab well. In addition, the colors are bright and clever, and easy to find in a messy toiletry drawer! I have already recommended these and will continue to.</li>
    <li> These are so excellent.  First, the color makes the tool very easy to find/locate.  Second of all, the tip is very thin and precise and perfect for tweezing eye brows, removing ticks, or splinters.  Very durable.  I will have these for years to come. Love it.</li>
    <li> Good for the home car and picnic adventures.  Little are not afraid of this gadget as compared to the needle when getting splinters out.</li>
    <li> There were some mixed reviews about this item and how it compares to the other brand that makes a very similar product. I bought it anyway, based on price. I&#x27;m pleased with the purchase, the tweezers work better than expected. I would buy another pair. I probably will too. I have a tendency to drop tweezers and if they land point side down, it&#x27;s all over with.</li>
    <li> I initially was looking for a tweezerman tweezer.  Then i came across tweezit.  It was less than half the price for the same item.  I gave it a try.  The item arrived as expected.  It is really good quality.  gets a good grip of the hairs.  occassionally i grip the hair to hard the it tears it and i cant remove it from the root (but thats my fault).  otherwise, its a great buy.  shipping was super fast as well!</li>
    <li> Great product for getting those hard-to-find splinters and ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like it. Doesn&#x27;t grasp fine hair.</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t even grip well enough to grasp a hair.  Was the only pair of tweezers I brought on vacation with me, left them in the motel trash can.</li>
    <li> Precise, sharp tweezers for a great deal. Excellent customer service from the seller.</li>
    <li> I purchased these Tweez&#x27;em after losing my tweezers (Revlon). I also bought a more expensive pair of tweezers from Rubis at the same time. You can tell that the quality of the Rubis tweezers is far superior...you get what you pay for. The Tweez&#x27;em tweezers worked, but only okay. They were not as good at grabbing and holding onto hairs as either the Rubis or my previous Revlon tweezers. I ordered these because they were cheap and had good reviews, but I wouldn&#x27;t order them again. I&#x27;d rather pay the extra $15 dollars for a nicer set of tweezers.</li>
    <li> The tips don&#x27;t align and are essentially useless.</li>
    <li> These are not worth it. I usually use Tweezerman products, but decided to try this because of the cheaper price. They arrived and did not work! It can&#x27;t even grip a simple,easy-to-grab hair on my eyebrow. Returned to Amazon and am ordering a Tweezerman product instead.</li>
    <li> They work great!!!  Can&#x27;t nitpick because these could pick nits.</li>
    <li> These are fantastic.  I have eyelashes that grow into my eye, and these are perfect for grabbing the small eyelashes and removing them.</li>
    <li> It is it the best tweezer , or the worst. It is in -between- for the price, it is worth it-</li>
    <li> I got these for getting the splinters out of my kids! :-)  After the first time we had to use them, I asked my spouse what she thought of them, and she said they are a million times better than the other regular tweezers we were using before.</li>
    <li> Omg, these worked once, and then afterwards they seemed to morph into the crappiest tweezer I ever owned. Don&#x27;t understand it, I based my purchase on the fantastic reviews, and was so disappointed. Perhaps they were defective, but not bothering to try again with this pair.</li>
    <li> Even though I thought this was a lot to pay for tweezers, they are worth every penny!  these tweezers have surgical precision.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve went through several Tweezerman ingrown hair tweezers.  The Tweezerman option of this product can be a hit or miss.  Two of the four pairs I purchased went dull after four months and a third was never aligned right. The fourth pair lasted about seven months.  I thought I would try the Tweezits as an alternative to Tweezerman because they are cheaper.  They work pretty well but you have to apply more pressure to close the ends.  Additionally, I don&#x27;t think the Tweezits are as sharp as the Tweezerman options.</li>
    <li> I just love my tweezers.  It gets the small hairs that other tweezers won&#x27;t get.  I would recommend to all.</li>
    <li> They are the best tweezers that I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> Good for picking out ingrown hairs because they are very fine toothed. However they do not hold hairs tight enough for plucking power possibly because they are so pointy. I was doing fine before with a sterilized sewing needle. Kinda regret this purchase.</li>
    <li> the tweezers do not make contact to pull anything</li>
    <li> I was searching for tweezers that were less expensive than Tweezerman, which have been more miss than hit lately.  Unfortunately, these were a total miss, even for the significantly lower price.  The points weren&#x27;t pointy at all and the tips weren&#x27;t even aligned well. They didn&#x27;t grasp regular hairs, forget ingrown hairs or splinters.  My search will continue...</li>
    <li> Useless!!! Unless your hair is as thick as horse&#x27;s hair, you can&#x27;t pull it with those clumsy huge tweezers. Medium and thin hair just sleeps through. Bad quality!</li>
    <li> horrible!!!! was literally only able to grab one hair and that was only after try thousands of times.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Delivered as offered.&lt;br /&gt;Ilse</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with the grasping ability of these. They just don&#x27;t cut it and will end up in my travel bag for emergencies only.</li>
    <li> Waste of money. Tweezers wouldn&#x27;t grip a hair,  more less remove it.</li>
    <li> best pair of tweezers I have ever owned. Used to have tweezerman but dropped them and bent the tip. These are far better and less costly!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and item is as described, thank you!</li>
    <li> I purchased these tweezers two years ago and they worked perfectly, but went dull. I purchased a replacement -- I dropped them once and one tip crumpled like aluminum foil. The previously purchased  set survived many drops. These aren&#x27;t as heavy as the old, they did work, but useless to me now.</li>
    <li> I love your product will be purchasing in the future.</li>
    <li> I really like these tweezers for lifting out short ingrown hairs. They are very sharp on the ends so keep the plastic cover in when not in use. For other tweeting I do have to go back to a flat tweezers. Overall, these work for me.</li>
    <li> These are complete junk!</li>
    <li> Great price. Fast shipping. Item arrived exactly as described.</li>
    <li> High quality product, great for snagging splinters out of little ones. Well made and the fine point tips pick up amazingly small items.</li>
    <li> it is sharp but it does not grasp as well as tweezerman.. the tweezerman when you close it has a much better grasp ... On hard to get ingrown hairs this just does not do the job like the tweezerman.</li>
    <li> These work awesome. They are made of metal and are of good quality. They work great on ingrown hairs. DO NOT LET CHILDREN play with them. I have made myself bleed with these several times because I accidentally poked myself with the tips of them. Nothing that could not be fixed. They work better then flat head tweezers. They make the person bleed less with these ingrown ones. 7/3/2015 I just purchased a one of these just within the last 4 days. Unfortunately, these ones we&#x27;re the worst that I have ever used. I pick my husband&#x27;s back with them every other night or so. The day we got them, I tried them on him, they could not even pull out an ingrown hair like they are supposed to. I even tried them on a regular hair and it just slipped right through the tweezers. Sorry people, these are not good.</li>
    <li> Just as described!  Very nice!</li>
    <li> This is a nice high quality all-metal tweezers.  It has a perfectly aligned tip.  Basically, if you can see something, you can pick it up with these tweezers.  Be warned though that these aren&#x27;t great for plucking hairs because there&#x27;s not much surface area where the tips meet, which makes it hard to grab a hair if its still attached to your body.</li>
    <li> Never again will I be without a fantastic pair of tweezers. This product is fabulous. You will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Great for removing splinters</li>
    <li> Great for ingrown hairs and catching fine single hairs that you might not get when shaving. Great for my eyebrows and everywhere else. Quality is great and strong.</li>
    <li> Very sharp pointy ends that close together evenly. Nice set of tweezers!</li>
    <li> They work real good on slivers.</li>
    <li> Love these....great for those stubborn hairs!!</li>
    <li> Super accurate, easy to handle. Great color to readily identify.</li>
    <li> Super-fine tips. Easy to handle. Amazing what you can drag out of a pore.</li>
    <li> I bought this tweezer to help with problems that a normal tweezer can&#x27;t fix. It has a very sharp tip. All in all, I was happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this tweezers several months ago and I don&#x27;t know how I lived without it.  In the past, a dug-in splinter required the use of a sewing needle AND my old eyebrow tweezers, but no more! These tweezers are well made; I expect them to last forever. I recommend this product as a best-buy.</li>
    <li> Go with Tweezerman.. These are not good.</li>
    <li> AWFUL! I wish I had been more on top of it and returned these to Amazon. They are worse than buying tweezers at a dollar store. I read the reviews before hand and it seemed like a good product. Maybe we just got a bad one.</li>
    <li> they are very long and sharp works great</li>
    <li> Steel ends do not line up perfectly as described; unfortunately this is going back.</li>
    <li> Leaves permanent scars</li>
    <li> I previously gave this one star but now 5 stars. They have sharpened the tip of these tweezers so it can do its job way better (which is to remove ingrown hairs). I received my new and improved product september 4th, so read the reviews at least after that date to make sure you are getting the reviews of the improved product. Hope this helps anyone who is confused reading good and bad reviews.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this seller - they have the LARGEST selection of TOP QUALITY Tweezers at half the price even at the flea markets. They have saved me hours of traveling time and shopping.&lt;br /&gt;I am a customer for LIFE!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Marsha in Florida</li>
    <li> Most tweezers &#x27;claim&#x27; to be fine tip tweezers, but they never are. And if you by super fine tip ones, they are used for crafts, not personal hygiene. These are perfect. Perfect tips, perfect feel.</li>
    <li> Got this for my tick removal kit.  The day the tweezers came in the mail, I discovered tiny wood splinters all over my 4 year old boy&#x27;s hands from him playing outside.  I used a 5x magnifying glass and these tweezers and they worked great.  I easily removed the splinters without hurting my boy.  They look sturdy enough but I think I read a review where the tweezer tips bent.  The tips on mine have not bent after I used them.  Time will tell if they bend or not, therefore I give these 4 stars.  I think these are very good for the price.</li>
    <li> Got this item on time and it&#x27;s as expected.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> These tweezers take a little bit of time to get used to, but once you do, they work really well to remove ingrown hairs! The appear to be a quality product.</li>
    <li> Absolutely a great Tweezering experience! A bit expensive when it comes to tweezers, but definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> Great control, grabs the thinnest of hairs and perfect for precision around eyebrows!</li>
    <li> worked better than I expected for splinters.</li>
    <li> Great item, fast shipment</li>
    <li> Stainless Steel Tweezers for Ingrown Hair. Great for Splinters and Glass Removal, debris, thorns, glass, metal, and other things embedded in fingers, hands, feet and legs?They are not just good for those troubled ingrown hair, but also for precision eyebrow plucking. They pick up smallest individual hair that standard tweezers would not be able to get to. I plucked my eyebrows fast easy and was almost painless. The tip is perfect for the smallest most stubborn hairs. Great for the eyebrows and all over you face and or body.Also great as a FIRST AID  tool to have in any first aid kit. You never know when you may need a pointed tweezer in any situation and or emergency Keep one in your medicine cabinet and one for your toolbox, or purse. I love these tweezers In General. Great grip did not hurt my hands to use at all. Very sturdy and durable as well they are not cheaply made. Great for many different uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Disclaimer I received this product For review and testing purposes however my opinions are honest and my own.</li>
    <li> These honestly are not to be used for tweezing eyebrow. I can&#x27;t even grab eyebrow hairs because the point is to sharp.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these tweezers! Perfect for plucking and ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve changed my mind after owning these and using them for a while. I originally gave them 4 stars, dinging them for not working quite as I expected. But, after getting used to them, I&#x27;ll attribute my earlier criticism to operator error on my part.   I had thought they were a bit too sharp for removing in-grown hairs but then I learned to gently grab the hair without digging in and cutting myself. Typically, an ingrown hair will have at least part of it very close to the surface so you only need scrape a tiny bit of skin, if any at all, to try and pull it out when it gets stuck under the surface of the top most layer. Anyhow, I am very please with them now that I&#x27;ve learned how to use them properly and not continually cut myself.</li>
    <li> Works well.  Good price.  Timely arrival. No problems with delivery. Only complaint is that they are a little too sharp and can actually hurt a little, but I guess that&#x27;s what makes them successful at getting those stubborn hairs.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are so good at freeing ingrown and soon-to-be ingrown hairs. They&#x27;re not so great at grabbing thicker hairs, but I didn&#x27;t buy them for that, so I am pleased.</li>
    <li> Great tweezers. Smallest point on tweezers I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> Makes a great weeding tool</li>
    <li> Not as fine a point as I had hoped, but a good price and very sturdy tool.  Definitely a quality product for the price</li>
    <li> Great tweezers. Size and shape make it really easy to use/handle. The point is sharp and doesn&#x27;t hurt when trying to get ingrowns. Definitely recommend</li>
    <li> this set of tweezers is a knock off of the well made brand tweezerman.  I had a pair of the real ones that I dropped and destroyed. they are at 1st look the same but this set has a much larger tip 3x or so making them very similar to normal tweezers. lucky they are cheap, lesson learned.</li>
    <li> Great quality and fast service.  Tweezers work better than expected.  Overall experience was excellent. I will purchase from this company again.</li>
    <li> They worked great for a month but got really dull.too fast for how the should perform!</li>
    <li> I bought these overpriced tweezers because of the rave reviews.  I didn&#x27;t expect to struggle with them to tweeze my brows and a few stray hairs.  I would not buy them again and I do not recommend these tweezers.</li>
    <li> Yes, yes, yes. Finally. Inexpensive tweezers that are sharp enough to do the job.Just keep the plastic cover on them when you aren&#x27;t using them and they will last for long</li>
    <li> Pretty good.  I think Tqeezerman has a better grip.</li>
    <li> these were awful and i returned them</li>
    <li> I actually bought this as a tool to unjam my letter folding machine. Paper gets jammed in the machine that is hard to get to with fingers and messes up your nails. This set of tweezers does the job admirably and saves me from additional cursing I would direct towards the folding machine. The precision tip is awesome and I would imagine would work great for beauty and health purposes. Great value for the price.</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t really pinch properly at the tip.  They work best about 2-3 mm in from the tip.  They seem to have more flex in the tips than I was expecting also.  Not what I was hoping for.</li>
    <li> These are sharp enough to remove an ingrown hair without much effort, and also have been very useful in the workshop to remove splinters.  The ends meet up perfectly to grab the splinter or hair and hang on while it&#x27;s removed.  I&#x27;ve used these to remove both wood and metal splinters, and they work faster and are less painful to use than other tweezers I have tried.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I am very disappointed with these tweezers. I bought them because I dropped my Tweezerman and thought I would give these a try. Although the design is nice, the tip is not grabbing the hair the way it should... when both tips meet, there are not properly in contact and that design flaw makes it too difficult to grab the hair; and trying to use them was so frustrating!  So I bought another pair of Tweezerman. Thank you for following up with my purchase. These did not work for me.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are great for pulling tiny eyebrow hairs that have broken or removing ingrown hairs. I really think I found a gem with this purchase. My only downside is that they do not remove some of the finer hairs that occasionally cause ingrown hairs. I am just not certain if that is the tweezer&#x27;s fault or if my hair can just be that fine.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for something like this for many years now.  Exactly what I was looking for.  I have used it many times over the past few months since my purchase on myself, the kids and for other fine tuned / tweezer type needs.</li>
    <li> The sharp, needle like tip makes these very useful, and they&#x27;re great for pulling out my ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downside is the tip is so fine it bends easily.  Mine already don&#x27;t align quite like they did when I got them.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are great for really hard to pull hairs. Regular tweezers can&#x27;t usually get them when the hair is barely poking through but these can! I like them a lot.</li>
    <li> The quality of this product is not the same as Tweezerman, which this product came up as the second list with a tweezerman search. Looks the same, shifty marketing - counterfeit.</li>
    <li> Hoped these would work better than they did.  They were not sharp enough to get the ingrown hairs.  Hopefully they work for you.</li>
    <li> This is a good tweezer for general purposes, but there are some things I had issues with. First, unlike other tweezers where the two arms will sort of &amp;#34;spring&amp;#34; back to place, these didn&#x27;t seem to do that and that felt weird. There was almost no resistance when you pressed them together. The other thing I didn&#x27;t like about these tweezer is that it didn&#x27;t seem very precise. While the points at the end of the tweezer looked sharp, it didn&#x27;t seem to always pick up something at the exact spot I&#x27;d aim for with the tweezer. Tweezerman is still much better and I kind of wish I hadn&#x27;t cheaped out.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this tweezer - grabs even the tiniest, finest hairs.  Great customer service from this company as well, appreciated the follow-up to find out if I was satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> These are the very best splinter tweezers available. They are strong and come with a protective cap.&lt;br /&gt; I would highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> Not as good as they used to be; in fact this one doesn&#x27;t line up well at all.</li>
    <li> i brought this for plucking brows and it does its job well, sturdy not easily breakable and looks like its going to last for a long time.</li>
    <li> I needed a pair of tweezers to remove splinters, glass, etc from my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This pair looks and feels really cheap. The yellow paint is flaking off the metal and the tip feels rough like the metal burs were not properly polished off completely. What gets me the most is how blunt the tip is. God forbid i ever need to dig around my skin to remove an object, because there is going to be a lot of collateral damage trying to dig it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is more of a cross between slant tip and point tip tweezers, so you know what you are buying.</li>
    <li> I never thought I would write a review about tweezers - but these are amazing.  They have an incredibly fine point which works perfect for ingrown hairs.  Not only that, but the point seems to be texturized so it actually grabs what you&#x27;re aiming for it to - rather than having it slip through the tweezers (which I&#x27;ve often encountered before).  This is gross, but: these are so precise I have even pulled out white-heads with them.</li>
    <li> It looked like it would work but the tips didn&#x27;t meet. Not sure I want to go through the trouble to return it.</li>
    <li> This little tool is amazing...I reach for it often to assist with hair removal and most recently, a super small metal splinter in my finger.  I love them!!!!  They are pointing and sharp so it is important to be mindful of that when using but they do serve their purpose.</li>
    <li> These are perfect for facial ingrown hairs. I use these after a good exfoliation and shave and have seen a huge improvement in ingrowns and redness in my neck beard.</li>
    <li> These are the only tweezersI know that come to a perfect and precise closure at the very tiny tip.  It is just what is needed to grasp a tiny deer tick accurately grasping only the head and not the whole body.  I have successfully gotten several off me with these.</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t grip the hairs</li>
    <li> Great pointy tweezers and great seller!</li>
    <li> The best tweezers in the world. They can even get hairs that are JUST coming out of your skin. I&#x27;m a neat freak for sure and I get a few hairs in odd places. The tweezers keep anything from being odd. Great grip!</li>
    <li> These are good? but they are a knock off of tweezerman which are TOTALLY better. We were bummed to be tricked by the yellow and similar name. We really wish we put the money toward actual tweezerman, these are very obviously not as high quality or as precise.</li>
    <li> Garbage don&#x27;t buy!! They don&#x27;t work. They have no strength at the tip. Will only grip where the paint starts.</li>
    <li> These are very good at removing splinters.  They come in a case, which is good for travel.  The price was also better than what is at most stores. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> These tweezers got dull on me way too fast for the price I paid.  I have dollar store tweezers that have outlived these ones.  This is only useful for my husband now.  My hair slides right out of them and I have pretty thick hair.</li>
    <li> Tweezit works great! Easy to hold and grabs well. Product is a good value and I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Perfect point to get the stubborn hairs!</li>
    <li> WOW, these are very thin pointed and sharp.  Just what I wanted. The ones at the drug store just don&#x27;t seem to do what I wanted.  Great tweezers for those tiny hairs, etc.</li>
    <li> This is my first ever product review on Amazon, and it&#x27;s for a great product!  I bought the Tweezit it version of these over the Tweezerman version because they were cheaper and had good reviews.  The reviews didn&#x27;t lie, and I&#x27;m super glad I didn&#x27;t waste the extra money going with a &amp;#34;name-brand.&amp;#34;  These tweezers are bigger than normal (eyebrow, slanted) tweezers, easy to hold, and very effective.  I will definitely keep my eye on this brand for any future purchases!</li>
    <li> The points of the needle are of extremely hard metal - they do not bend nor deform in use.  They are the ultimate answer to removing splinters!  The tweezers are 4.5 inches long and have a plastic sheath tip to protect you and the tweezers&#x27; tips.</li>
    <li> Sharp, sharp, sharp!  Great for reaching ingrown hairs!  I thought my old pair of tweezers was sharp until I received this one.</li>
    <li> Very sharp tweezers. Excellent for ingrown hairs. Still sharp after six months of use. Comes with a pouch and a cap. Very nice, does the job, and inexpensive. I&#x27;m glad that I didn&#x27;t pass these up.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and always have had problems with ingrown hairs. These are by far the very best tweezers I have ever found for getting them out. Even though they come to kind of a sharp point, they do NOT hurt my skin or leave scars!</li>
    <li> These things are fantastic! Super sharp, which is exactly what is needed when digging out splinters and ingrown hairs. They also come with a little plastic safety tip to use while storing them, which is definitely needed. Overall, they are great and are exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Very precise edges. Very sharp.</li>
    <li> The Best, super sharp</li>
    <li> I love love love these tweezers! They really help with getting those smaller hard to grab hairs. I would totally recommend this to anyone who has stubborn hairs that are hard to pluck!</li>
    <li> Gets at those ingrown buggers very well.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because it had very postive reviews, I tried it the day I got it and was really disappointed. It didn&#x27;t grip well at all! I looked at the tip and it looked perfectly lined up so I have no idea why it could not grab any hairs. I ended up just using my old tweezer and throwing out the one I had just bought.</li>
    <li> Very nice for getting slivers out, works great on ingrown hairs too.</li>
    <li> Perfect for removing splinters. I like this product! Would recommend.</li>
    <li> This are of high quality !!  Work great !</li>
    <li> This is a great product for ingrown hair. The brand may not be very well-known like Tweezerman, but it works better than most of the other competitive products.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> These are larger than they look and the long skinny tips are not that long and skinny. I don&#x27;t see how these can be good for delicate tweezing like ingrown hairs as they are hard to wield. The paint and brand name are really cheap. I&#x27;m returning them and sticking with the tweezers I already have. Also, I bought these for $5.99 and the price is back up to $10.19 as a write this. If you are going to give them a try, watch the price for a bit and wait for it to go down.</li>
    <li> Ingrown hairs suck. These make dealing with them better. But watch out! They&#x27;re incredibly sharp! Also very helpful in separating greys from the rest if your hair before you pluck. But don&#x27;t use them for your brows-- remember that they&#x27;re sharp! You could take an eye out. I&#x27;m serious!</li>
    <li> Great for getting ingrown hairs. These tweezers are the perfect sharpness - sharp enough to get just under the skin without injuring yourself. I&#x27;ve only had them for a few weeks, so not sure of longevity. Good price too.</li>
    <li> We purchased these tweezers in anticipation for tick season and we live in the country with animals and lots of ticks. The first use of the tweezers though was because of a deep splinter I got underneath  my fingernail. It was a light colored, very thin splinter and I couldn&#x27;t even see it, only feel it. I was alone and had no &amp;#34;help&amp;#34; to see or try to get it out. I found I was able, without even SEEING the splinter, to go beneath my skin, under my nail bed, into the entry &amp;#34;hole&amp;#34; and pull out the splinter. In one try no less. No normal tweezer could have done such a thing. I was thrilled to be able to help myself with this tool and I am happy to have purchased two of them and will buy more. Thanks.</li>
    <li> It is a great Tweezer.  It has a very fine end that is perfect to get the most difficult ingrown hairs and a good size that makes it easy to hold.</li>
    <li> works better on splinters than ingrown hairs, the points are so fine that sometimes it cuts the hair in half.  used them last night on some wire brush fragments and were perfect for this job</li>
    <li> I was happy to find a pair of super sharp tweezers!  These work much better for ingrown hairs than your typical tweezers.  I dropped one star though only because at times I found that it completely cut the hair in half being as sharp as they are which made it difficult to grab the leftover piece.</li>
    <li> I could kick myself for trying to save money and frankly, trying something new. I&#x27;ll stick to Tweezerman from now on.</li>
    <li> Perhaps I was trying to use these in the wrong capacity but they just don&#x27;t work.  No grab of anything from slivers to hairs.  Will be getting rid of these for the more traditional kind.  Disappointing.</li>
    <li> VERY Pleased with this product!&lt;br /&gt;Exactly What I Wanted for my need!!&lt;br /&gt;The Quality is EXCEPTIONAL!! STURDY!!&lt;br /&gt;Not Cheaply Constructed!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to purchase A Lot More, &amp; keep some&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;On Hand&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Good quality</li>
    <li> I bought these and they were defective, but they immediately took excellent care of me, and I&#x27;ll be ordering another one really soon!! They really stand behind their product. Really impressed.</li>
    <li> No complaints - this is a very good product that works very well. Tips are sharp and thin, making them easy to use. Delivery was fast.</li>
    <li> Ingrown whiskers can be a real bugger to get out- these tweezers are amazing!  And for those of us men who are in our 40&#x27;s and beyond and starting to grow hair where we don&#x27;t want it (ears), the Tweezit can grab just and pull out about anything!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to imagine what could be improved on this tweezers.  If you want tweezers with a precise point and don&#x27;t mind the risk of stabbing yourself, these tweezers are ideal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For guys with ingrown facial hair issues, say goodbye to the needle needed to lift the hair before you can get it with other tweezers.  These can directly grab the ingrown hair with less than 1/4 the damage to your skin that a needle does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The grip on the hairs is also quite good.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet but it will work for removing ticks.  Have used similiar ones.</li>
    <li> I have been a Tweezerman slave for many years and have finally found a less expensive alternative.  These are great!</li>
    <li> These are ABSOLUTELY amazing!!!&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for ingrown hairs and absolutely awesome for eyebrows :)&lt;br /&gt;I received these for free for my unbiased opinion however I will be purchasing another pair for backup!!</li>
    <li> Lost its grip- ability to hold on to the tiny hair- in a week or less.. Very disappointing</li>
    <li> Great product!  High quality and very useful for ingrown hairs.  Can&#x27;t imagine a better product plus a nice price.</li>
    <li> I will be honest about these tweezers. I do not like them at all. I find that they go dull after a short time and they did not match up to my Tweezerman ones. I would not recommend these and will not be buying them again.</li>
    <li> I have owned every type of tweezer from slanted to straight and like many of us, finding a good pair you can depend on does not come easy. Yes, there are many brands on the market and I must admit that some of my favorites, are &amp;#34;no-names&amp;#34; that came part of a manicure and/or grooming set. I then purchased higher priced brands where a mini tweezer costs over $20 and you can barely hold on to the thing if you have normal sized hands. Drove anyone I ever lend to use that tweezer crazy, but it created laughs while you are trying to dig out a splinter, so I saw it as a great distraction while you are digging into someone&#x27;s hand!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Majestic Bombay offered I try out their Twwez&#x27;em pair that was normal size and created with a pointed tip, which aids in digging out anything from splinters to ingrown hairs. I find that when it comes to reviewing devices of this kind, it comes rather easy, as they either work or they don&#x27;t. I have tweezers I have coveted over the years as the ones you depend on, so I keep those pair in a box safely.  I never had a set that even had a 50/50 rating of getting a hair. Most just snip the hair, cause bleeding and if you are lucky....both occur.  Like I said, you work or you don&#x27;t!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the Tweeze&#x27;em set arrived, I had a small ingrown hair by my eyebrow towards the lid. One of my many older sets just cut the hair and trimmed it so nicely that the hair remained visible but impossible to pluck! Love when that happens. I tried the Tweeze&#x27;em right out of the package and noticed the tips did not meet so well, but I have pairs that look like they don&#x27;t but still perform very well. I used the tip and  attempted to lift the hair and it did but could not pluck it. I tried and tried and the skin became red and irritated, I then started to bleed, so I now was left with a visible ingrown that would get a nice scab to go with it. This ingrown hair was making friends! I then decided to try the tweezers on a normal hair that was not ingrown or short in length. Probably should have tried this first before but the idea popped into my head after. The Tweeze&#x27;em could not pluck that hair either. I tried another hair and again nothing. The tweezers are also not ergonomic when it comes to holding and using. They are straight and the metal is hard to bend closed, plus the yellow paint makes gripping difficult, as the paint was not applied smoothly. I thought the issues with the paint would aid in gripping but the uneven surface makes how you hold the tweezers difficult and especially if you have even the slightest of length on your nails (the bumps in the paint bother and some look like drips of paint running down). I can only maybe see using the Tweeze&#x27;em as a craft tool, where I don&#x27;t want paint on my hands and need to hold something that is not delicate or easy to mark. I wanted to like this pair but it just did not perform well in what it was meant to be use for......plucking a hair!  I received the above product(s) free of charge from the Majestic Bombay Company.

    <li> Tried on ingrown hairs.  If you want to bleed go ahead and purchase this.  Guess it&#x27;s good for splinters, etc.</li>
    <li> Came bent and dull.  Returned for a refund.</li>
    <li> Great tweezers, thanks!</li>
    <li> Great product!  Very sharp and they work very well.  Very hard to find tweezers that are sharp enough and work! Good price?</li>
    <li> Ends did not align, completely worthless.  When I bought it was labeled as tweezerman then they changed it up and sent me a Tweezit brand for the price of a Tweezerman.  I wouldn&#x27;t be as mad if they actually worked.  After paying for this, more than it was worth, the seller had me pay to return it.  Fail!</li>
    <li> I love everything about these tweezers! I like the fit in my hand, no slippage, sharp as a tack, and that they’re yellow! Talk about easy to find in my make-up kit!!  #MBSplintertweeze&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLAIMER:  I received the product mentioned above complimentary for review and testing purposes.

    <li> I need strong needlepoint tweezers for working with ecig mods and tanks, adjusting pins and such. I&#x27;ve had these for maybe 2 months now and they still work like new. Honestly, I was skeptical at first, pleasantly surprised when I received &amp; used one of these. They are as good as any of the higher priced tweezers.</li>
    <li> Ends are extremely precise. Comparably sharp as 2 needles coming together. Requires a steady hand to use.</li>
    <li> Great product,great service!</li>
    <li> I use it for perler beading</li>
    <li> These tweezers are amazing. They will grab the shortest of hairs and hairs buried underneath your skin and pull them out with ease. I use them daily.</li>
    <li> Hate it...doesn&#x27;t pull really short hairs, which was my reason for buying</li>
    <li> I am a licensed aesthetician and work at a full body waxing salon - these are amazing for ingrowns. HIGHLY recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted tweezers that could &amp;#34;dig&amp;#34; out those not so easily attainable ingrown hairs. I have dark, thick obnoxious hair and I&#x27;m telling you, these work perfectly. I am a huge fan. When I need another pair, I will definitely come back a order again. I wish they came in different colors :) I really have nothing negative to say. THEY WORK!!</li>
    <li> I use one to unclog the spray holes in my dishwasher and one for in-grown facial hair.  This is a great product at an awesome price.</li>
    <li> Pretty darn good. It&#x27;s surprising how a specially-designed pair of tweezers can make a difference. The VERY sharp, pointy ends to a fantastic job of helping clear ingrown hairs. I&#x27;ll admit to having a problem with this primarily on my upper, inner thigh. If you stay ahead of the game, and get after ingrowns while they&#x27;re *early*, using these tweezers, you can prevent big nasty-looking red bumps, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did have one pair grow slightly &amp;#34;flat&amp;#34; - where the pointy end didn&#x27;t exactly have the micro-grip it initially had. BUT, this was after some pretty hard pushing the tips together over some months, and so I think it&#x27;s expected to have this happen. I ordered another pair; hey, they don&#x27;t cost your life savings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus, my headline: Good product that &amp;#34;just works&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I had Tweezerman point tweezers which broke, and when I went to replace them I discovered these were available for 1/3 the price. I thought I&#x27;d give them a shot and I&#x27;m glad I did. They work just as well and I saved some money.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are great for their intended use, tweeting eyebrows. Also, they work for removing splinters.  However, I purchased them to replace a pair I&#x27;ve had for over 30 years that I use along with mascara.  After each coat, I carefully separate my eyelashes and remove clumps.  They are very, very sharp, so I take great care not to poke myself.  Afterwards, I clean them thoroughly in case they&#x27;re needed for yet another purpose.  These tweezers are quite versatile, and I love them!</li>
    <li> It works, but not nearly as well as Tweezerman brand, not even close.  The tip on this brand is twice the size so it&#x27;s not quite good for tough/small spots.  I greatly prefer my Tweezermen ones still for splinters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it three stars though because they work just fine for tweezing eyebrows and such.  I just won&#x27;t use them for splinters or ingrowns.</li>
    <li> excellent item, shipping took a little long however item is as described- very easy to grip with wide flange in middle of item. point is fine, good packaging. recommend. price was fair- quality great.</li>
    <li> They copied everything from Tweezerman except the quality.  They even found a way to get their product to pop up on top of a search for Tweezerman, misleading at best</li>
    <li> this tweezer gets out even the tiniest hairs.  Makes a tough job much easier.  Great tool at a great price</li>
    <li> This review has been edited. I have left the original review and added to the end.   These tweezers did not work. They were not sharp. The ends did not line up-making it impossible to tweeze. I did like the feel of the tweezers and the grip. I just wished it would have worked. Very impressed with amazon service.  I have been an amazon customer for a long time.  This was my first return. Went perfect. Excellent customer service.  Edit:::: the product has been redesigned and improved. The tweeze point is more precise. The tweezer grabbed and held. I was even able to get some ingrown hairs. The tweezer does not have the sharpest point as some tweezers do but they are quite tapered to make it a more precise tweeze. The grip is very comfortable and large enough to not cause cramps in your fingers when using.  Over all I would recommend these tweezers. I will add that I am happy with the eagerness of the company to please their customers.</li>
    <li> Sturdy and well made, but does not align perfectly. As a result, it&#x27;s really ineffective for grasping a single hair or small splinter. Bought these to replace a lost pair of Tweezerman tweezers that look essentially the same. Should have stuck with the name brand, even at a higher price. I threw out the packaging or I&#x27;d probably return them.</li>
    <li> These tweezers worked perfect for me! The tips are very &amp;#34;pointed&amp;#34; and worked great</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I often get ingrown hairs that normal tweezers can&#x27;t handle for numerous reasons. When used carefully, I was able to remove ingrown hairs without scarring my skin in the process or driving the hair deeper into the infected pore.</li>
    <li> We have a pair of these tweezers and use them to remove splinters, thorns, etc...  The original pair is by a brand all know and see, but I wanted an additional pair for upstairs...but didn&#x27;t want to pay the price.  Amazon came through again...  Found these, they come in a little soft case to protect them....and they are excellent.  Tips line up perfectly and work just as well...  the expensive pair isn&#x27;t even &#x27;gold&#x27; colored!!  Thank you to the people who developed these as an option to paying in the $30.00 range for splinter tweezers!!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. Easy to use and the best tweezers I have ever used. I recommend 100%! Great for brows!</li>
    <li> Intricate enough to pull a small splinter from under my husband&#x27;s fingernail...and without any pain!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Great quality and perfect for in-grown facial hairs.  For the good price, I didn&#x27;t expect good quality.  I ended up giving it to my mom who is a professional beautician. To her, the quality was exemplary and was very impressed.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Best Tweezers Ever!  Ever!!!  Errant hairs never stood a chance.</li>
    <li> These came in very handy after doing some yardwork when I got a few splinters. These tweezers made it much easier to remove the splinters than my previous part as they have a fine point that works well.</li>
    <li> I have gone through ALOT of tweezers and the more expensive ones as well and these are the BOMB!!  I would buy these again in a heart beat!!</li>
    <li> ...but wish the grabbers had a bit more grab to them.  I find these tweezers, in conjunction with my favorite pair of grabbers, are a perfect pair.  I was hoping to have one pair of tweezers to rule them all, but I am learning to do the job quite well with two.  Watch out vile chin hairs!</li>
    <li> The points don&#x27;t align so it doesn&#x27;t grab hair.</li>
    <li> it works, good condition.</li>
    <li> got this for a trip to Zambia, Africa, believe me you want these when you go there because everything in Africa has thorns!</li>
    <li> Best tweezers I have ever owned.  They work for everything.</li>
    <li> I need strong needlepoint tweezers for working with ecig mods and tanks, adjusting pins and such. I&#x27;ve had these for maybe 2 months now and they still work like new. I am very happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of tweezit- I have one at work and one at home. They are not just good for the ingrown hair but also for precision eyebrow plucking. They pick up smallest individual hair that standard tweezers wood not. My fist pair was bought over a year ago and still works like new.</li>
    <li> When it comes to what they were made form which is taking care of the ingrown hairs. They get the job done. Plain and simple</li>
    <li> Super sharp! Possibly sharper than I expected them to be! They&#x27;re awesome.</li>
    <li> I may just not be skilled in the tweezing department, but they are soooo super thin that gripping onto any hair is difficult.  I tried using them to tweeze out in-grown hairs but ended up using them to assist my pedicures instead. They&#x27;re okay. I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily buy them again, but I may just no know how to use them &#x27;correctly&#x27;.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted. Easy to use&amp; definitely great for picking out small things such as splinters &amp; tics.</li>
    <li> does not work- save your money</li>
    <li> Sharp and get the job done.</li>
    <li> these tweezers work perfectly if you like to puncture holes in your skin and if you&#x27;re looking for something with slippery coated ends to grab your teeny tiny hairs with.  otherwise, they were very helpful.  signed, a hairy Sasquatch</li>
    <li> I am updating my review today 9/5/14 because I was contacted by the Majestic Bombay people, letting me know that they realized that their earlier design of these tweezers had not been a winner, so they sent me a replacement one that features their new design.  I thought it was great that they followed up and went to the trouble and expense to send me a new tweezer!  I am happy to report that the new design works great!  I really like the ultra sharp tip, which is great for some things.  I can definitely recommend these tweezers now, and I feel good about the efforts of the company to improve their design.        Old review:  I purchased these tweezers as a replacement for some other sharp-point tweezers that I lost.  These arrived and look fine, but they don&#x27;t work well at all for tweezing eyebrows.  Only the very tip of the ends comes together, so it is extremely difficult to grab a hair.  I suppose these might be great for splinters, though I&#x27;m not sure how that would work any better than it does for eyebrows.  Maybe I misunderstood what these would work for.</li>
    <li> Love these tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are high quality material.&lt;br /&gt;Are very pointy and sharp to be able to slice the skin a bit to grab some ingrowns.&lt;br /&gt;Nice comfortable large size with great grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, if I ever need more fine point tweezers I would only buy this brand from now on.</li>
    <li> Tip fine enough to grab ingrown hair. Strong enough to pull them out too. Price is very decent. Good deal.</li>
    <li> They work really well. We liked these so much that we ordered a second pair. The price was good too.</li>
    <li> Every bit as good as bigger BRANDs, but for a rational price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not so sure how great they are for ingrowns in place of a safety pin or anything else sharp. You still pretty much have to rip open any skin covering the hair or splinter you are trying to remove. I found that a small safety pin works much better for me along with a different pair of tweezers with a better grip (they are made by revlon and I&#x27;ve also reviewed them)</li>
    <li> This works just as it&#x27;s supposed to. It is a good quality tweezer and the case is good as well.</li>
    <li> True breath of fresh air to use this product, especially as I get older, makes the little  &amp;#34; splinters &amp;#34; in life easy to handle, Thanks for providing.</li>
    <li> I was looking for some very sharp tweezers to put into first aid kits I was assembling for my family.  These fit the bill perfectly -- very sharp and easy to manipulate.  Great for splinters.  What else could one want?</li>
    <li> These tweezers are awesome the the price is fantastic! I had one just like it and it broke after 10 yrs I hope this one lasts just as long</li>
    <li> These are tweezers, they pluck the hair out of my eyebrows just as I&#x27;d hope they do. Sharp tips. Thanks</li>
    <li> Very excellent price, it&#x27;s almost a necessity for removing splinters  that either I receive or my grandchildren get while playing</li>
    <li> I was looking for pointed tweezers that were under $20, which is difficult to find in stores.  These tweezers are great for getting out ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> I was not pleased with the quality  of these Tweezem Stainless  Steel  Tweezers. I have been using a more expensive brand,when those broke I thought I would give these a try. They did work ok, but when trying to get the shorter hairs they could grab it but seemed to slip a lot making it very hard to pull the hair out. In short. You get what you pay for. SAve you time and money, buy a better product  like a tweezerman</li>
    <li> It does decent work but not at sharp as it appears</li>
    <li> Love these tweezers. They work great!!</li>
    <li> Nice and pointy to poke at ingrown hair but can&#x27;t tweeze most of the time.</li>
    <li> work as well as Tweezerman</li>
    <li> These tweezers grab everything. A very good deal. They come in a near case with a tip protector so they also travel well.</li>
    <li> These tweezers were great.&lt;br /&gt;For some odd reason, they started to bend at the tip&lt;br /&gt;after only a month or so.&lt;br /&gt;Only used them for tweezing ingrown hairs, and I know my hair is not that tough!&lt;br /&gt;If they had not started to bend at the tip slightly I would have given them a five star.</li>
    <li> I dropped my Tweezerman tweezers and bent the tips, so I decided to give these a try since they&#x27;re half the price. They feel the same in my hand but I think the tips just aren&#x27;t quite as fine as they are on the Tweezermans. The difference is really negligible though so I think these are a better value and would purchase these again.</li>
    <li> Very good tweezers at a very reasonable price. Quite as good as the more expensive variety. I plan to buy another as I dropped mine and that very fine point landed point down!</li>
    <li> I actually ordered thinking it was Tweezerman (didn&#x27;t pay close enough attention...didn&#x27;t think anyone else would&#x27;ve manufactured bright yellow tweezers).  As soon as I saw the tip, I realized these were not Tweezerman.  The tip is quite a bit less pointed.  They do work, but I have to work a lot harder.</li>
    <li> The tweezers were a lot cheaper than the other brand and work great! I&#x27;m very satisfied. Planning on buying a second set.</li>
    <li> I have looked everywhere for a good pair of tweezers, and these are it! I have used these already for removing a splinter, but the main reason I purchased these was to put in my first aid kit in my camper for those nasty ticks, just in case. They are a little pricy, but well worth it!</li>
    <li> These are pretty good.  The tips could be a bit better designed though, as far as them bowing open if you squeeze them too hard.</li>
    <li> Good twister specially for ingrown hair.  I think it is the best option out there for twisters. Good price also.</li>
    <li> Great product!  A must have in the house and this product delivers. Highly recommend so I am going to buy more...</li>
    <li> This worked the first time or two, now the tip won&#x27;t tweeze anything.  Just slips off with no result. Very frustrating.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, tweezers are excellent at removing difficult to get ingrown hairs, extremely sharp tips and very sleek easy to hold design!</li>
    <li> This is a superb item and the quality of construction rivals the more expensive tweezer brands.. Seems like it will stay sharp and last quite a long time. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Not what I expected.  Will not really hold on to ingrown hair.  I&#x27;ve had much better.</li>
    <li> Very happy with order, great quality tweezers!</li>
    <li> I was excited for this tweezer because they looked sharp. I have a hard time finding tweezers that actually grasp and pull hair out without spending 2+ minutes on a single hair. One of the tips of this tweezer was bent, thus it wouldn&#x27;t grasp hair without slipping over and over again. Even on the thickest hair, the tweezer wouldn&#x27;t grasp it long enough to pull it out. It was not worth the $8 I spent, and I&#x27;m returning it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;________________________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 11/3/14&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Majestic Bombay sent me a free replacement of this tweezer in September: they said it was an improved version. After using the tweezer for about two months, I am comfortable saying they are most definitely improved. The previous version was awful and could not grasp even the thickest hair. The new version, however, grasps and pulls hair almost effortlessly. I find the tweezers will slip while pulling hair at least once or twice every time I use them, which is why I rated them 4 stars vs. 5 stars. Nevertheless, even though I have to work to pull the hair more than once sometimes, I would recommend these tweezers for $8.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;________________________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 06/27/15&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used these tweezers since September 2014, so I am updating my review to speak to the longevity of the product. They were only $8 at the time of my purchase, so I suppose you get what you pay for. I see they are about $10 now and I wouldn&#x27;t pay that for these. I definitely wouldn&#x27;t pay the original price that&#x27;s nearly $20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had difficulty with the tweezers grasping the hair, which I noted in my previous review. This problem has been exacerbated by the tweezer&#x27;s dull tips. There are many, many, many times where these tweezers will simply not pull the hair out and I have to revert to a different tweezer. I can see this happening on very fine hair, but these eyebrow hairs are thick and should be easily grasped (which they are, using other tweezers). I&#x27;m currently looking for another pair because I hate spending 5 minutes trying to get two hairs plucked. They were great for the first month or two, but they did dull rather quickly and have always had problems grasping hair.</li>
    <li> These tweezers work wonderfully for those painful ingrown hairs. Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is OK, would like more if the grabber part of tweezers were shorter. Difficult to use due to length.</li>
    <li> These were exactly what I was looking for.  The ends are quite sharp, but they come together very precisely so it&#x27;s easy to grip even the smallest items with ease.  These have a lot of good uses, and delivery was also very prompt.</li>
    <li> As a physician, my first instinct is to look for quality. These tweezers are absolutely &amp;#34;surgical grade.&amp;#34;  The main question regarding tweezers is whether the tips match/line up exactly. No space is visible, even with a bright light behind it, when the tweezers are gently closed. This is what I noted with these tweezers and I have been extremely happy with them when I use them for my patients.&lt;br /&gt;Keep up the great work!!!</li>
    <li> Love these tweezers.  They work for everything and the length is perfect.  Have to keep taking them back from my kids and husband.  Good quality.</li>
    <li> Shipped fast. These tweezers are sturdy and sharp, perfect for ingrown hairs. They also came with a nice sleeve to protect the tip.</li>
    <li> Really does its job well, specially on splinters. It removes splinters easily, you won&#x27;t feel anything at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had better tweezers that work better than these, but I think my old ones were made in Italy and were aligned at the tips better than these, which I suspect are made in China. The tips don&#x27;t align up as good as they can for gripping hair or splinters, but they can do the job with repeated attempts when placing them at the source.</li>
    <li> Good quality, heavy tweezers.  Seem to be well made.</li>
    <li> This item was purchased as part of a first aid kit for my husband&#x27;s workshop.</li>
    <li> the point was thick and not needlepoint like Tweezerman. Maybe good for splinters but too thick for ingrown hair (specially eyebrows). Returned it.</li>
    <li> This will cause serious damage if you aren&#x27;t careful! They are super sharp and very pointed. Do not let kids near these; they can easily pierce the skin... and I bled! Otherwise, they are great.</li>
    <li> I have a few recurrent pesky hairs, esp on my ears, that require a delicate approach to keep them from becoming ingrown. The only tweezers I&#x27;ve been able to find were in a survival kit and were very small although they work. I bought these and they work just fine. Well made and the price is pretty good.</li>
    <li> very sharp, well made, The &amp;#34;cadillac&amp;#34;of tweezers!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t read closely enough and thought these were just like my Tweezerman tweezers.  Unfortunately, these are a lesser quality product and the tips do not squeeze together well enough to capture fine or slippery hairs.  Won&#x27;t be fooled again!</li>
    <li> Very good one and  very useful.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used them, but for some reason, I didn&#x27;t read the caption and thought they were tweezerman. They are &#x27;Majestic Bombay&#x27; brand. If I like using them I&#x27;ll change my rating.</li>
    <li> I love these tweezers.  Nice and pointy and sharp.  Great for getting those hard to reach spots</li>
    <li> The tip is too blunt; not good for getting at ingrown hairs. This was a waste of my money. Would not recommend</li>
    <li> As a nurse I feel every first aid kit  should include a surgical grade splinter remover. Tweezers of this caliber are difficult to find.  The points are precision made, and can extract a splinter with ease.  They are sturdy, and able to be sterilized.  I highly recommend this product for all School Nurse Offices, field trip first aid kits,  home first aid kits, campers, wood and construction workers.  I feel very  fortunate to have been able to find this product and at this price.  (I bought 4)</li>
    <li> These things are extremely accurate, and are of particular use to African Americans as ingrown hairs can be be a serious problem. I&#x27;ve never owned any tweezers which are as effective as these at removing hairs. They are also very good for splinters.</li>
    <li> I have no complaints about these tweezers. They aren&#x27;t the best or the worst pair I&#x27;ve bought. For the price, they are a good deal.</li>
    <li> Great item at a great price! I was skeptical at first, pleasantly surprised when I received &amp; used this item; they are as good as any of the higher priced tweezers. I plan to purchase other style tweezers from this company.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve never had a pair of good tweezers, you will never appreciate what these will do.  They are great for splinters, precision retrieval, and apparently based on their title removing hairs but I&#x27;ve never used them for that.  I bought 6 pairs of these for gifts to friends and family who all love having them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of these items you will never appreciate having until you need it, and have it.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are really nice. Relatively inexpensive and they work well. The end point is precisely shaped and has good grip. I work out in the yard, and occasionally have to remove splinters and tiny cactus thorns. Would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> These tweezers by Majestic Bombay are amazing. They have a very fine pointed end which makes them perfect for getting the shortest of hairs, splinters, or even ingrown hairs. I use these all the time. They are a great thing to have on hand. They are strong and durable, made of stainless steel. It&#x27;s amazing how precise and easy to use they are. They have a very tight pinch, so you can squeeze the tiniest hairs. I am a tweezaholic, I am constantly trying to get those tiny microscopic eyebrow hairs before they are long enough with a regular tweezers, but with these elongated pointed tweezers, I can get them before they are visible to anyone else. I have also used these to get a splinter from my boyfriends hand. They worked great, even when the splinter was hardly visible.Overall I think these tweezers are a great product and I think everyone should have a set on hand.</li>
    <li> Nice precision instrument - highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving 4 stars because I haven&#x27;t tried them in a real need situation....  Tips are aligned very well... they are sharp.... and have a good clamping force without bending....  I do believe they will pull deep slivers or those NASTY ingrown hairs...  From what I can see, they are a good deal...</li>
    <li> Great tweezers. Easy to hold, and easy to get at splinters or hairs with the narrow, sharp hands. Easy to find in the bathroom door with the bright color too.</li>
    <li> I bought these because I found a tick in our sons ear a month ago and regular tweezers did not do a good job at removing it. Fortunately we did not have anymore tick episodes but with 2 young boys we&#x27;ve used them for 2 splinters and they works wonderfully. Definitely work it.</li>
    <li> Bent the first time I used. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> excellent quality tweezers,very good for removing unwanted hairs and splinters</li>
    <li> Great splinter remover - my hubby thinks I&#x27;m a genius.</li>
    <li> Excellent for avoiding ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> Perfect for those fine regrowing hairs.</li>
    <li> Hands down, the best pair of tweezers I have ever owned!</li>
    <li> The tweezers tips were fairly thick and if splinter was deep hard to maneuver around object you were trying to grab. Yellow color great. Would not buy this style again.</li>
    <li> Lol, shortly after Tweezerman moves its manufacturing to \\&quot;Tweezerman India\\&quot; a wave of knock-offs from India floods the market!  Compare this Tweez&#x27;em to [[ASIN:B00HDFZNN4 Tweezerman G.E.A.R. Ingrown Hair SplinterTweeze]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I own both this model and the Tweezerman and they&#x27;re VERY close.  If anything this Tweez&#x27;em is perhaps 90% as pointy/sharp as the Tweezerman.  At 1/3 the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish it would say \\&quot;Stainless\\&quot; somewhere on the package or tweezers, it does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, for seven dollars and fifty cents they will do most of what you need them to do.  And the package serves as a handy case, unlike the Tweezerman model.  Just be careful not to drop them and keep the plastic tip guard on them and they should last you.</li>
    <li> I found these tweezers difficult to pluck the hairs.The slightest pinch would break the hair.</li>
    <li> Thank you for the very promt shipping.  These are great ,very sharp. They have performed  as hoped. The best for those pesky black hairs on my face and chin. Had to be careful not to damage the skin in area Little practice perfected the use of these</li>
    <li> These tweezers work great for getting out splinters.  Able to reach in and grab even tiny ones and remove thorns as well.</li>
    <li> Did not work for me all! returned it and went back to the Tweezerman. It&#x27;s a little more expensive but worth it.</li>
    <li> Extremely precise and you can&#x27;t beat the price!!!</li>
    <li> Works for the most part, but not completely</li>
    <li> These tweezers work like a charm!  I would rank them along with higher priced tweezers as being just as good in quality and in effectiveness.</li>
    <li> Best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
    <li> My mom lost her favorite tweezers over the summer and our hair dresser recommended these from Majestic Bombay. I included them in her stocking, and she was thrilled. She was even happier after trying them out as they put her misplaced favorites to shame. We both agree they are fantastic.</li>
    <li> Great tweezers! I am mostly using these to apply small rhinestones to fingernails. However, when my nephew fell on a cactus.. they worked wonderfully for pulling out all of the splinters!</li>
    <li> This product is simply fabulous. I love it!</li>
    <li> Nothing at all like a tweezerman. Broke many of the hairs off I was trying to pluck.</li>
    <li> If you are trying to get it but have had trouble.. you will be able to with these tweezers! Splinters, ingrown hairs, or even glas.. this tweezers is amazing but sharp so be careful.</li>
    <li> The tweezers are very pointy and grip fine hairs very well. If you use too much pressure they might &amp;#34;snip&amp;#34; the hair, but when you get use to them they are very good. The company is very nice to deal with and cares about their customers.</li>
    <li> To be clear these are not Tweezerman Needlenose Tweezers.  They are some knock off from india or china.  You get what you pay for!  The point is not sharp and will not tweeze an ingrown hair.  I am ordering the true tweezerman version today!</li>
    <li> Very very useful tool for getting those hard to grip hairs. Be careful, these are sharp! I would definitely recommend these to anyone who is searching for good tweezers.</li>
    <li> Great transaction! Fast shipping and item works and looks as described!! Thanks!!</li>
    <li> These tweezers did not pull ingrown hairs like I expected them to.  I will probably try a different brand; these tweezers were not worth the price.</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t work well. It breaks the hair and slices it instead of grabbing and pulling it out. Will buy tweezerman next time. This has happened 8 times on the first use. So threw them away. Waste of money.    Company sent me a new pair after I posted my original comments. They worked much better as they were sharper and stronger. They worked a lot better than before but I had already replaced these with tweezermam ones that were still better. The sharpness is the same but the ability to grab and hold onto the hair could still be improved upon.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are so useful! I found them to be really easy to grip and the precision was amazing!&lt;br /&gt; I used these to remove a splinter effectively and to rid my eyebrow of a pesky ingrown hair. These are a must have for anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these for free to review, but I only review my real experiences. These are awesome.</li>
    <li> Good buy ! Work great! No complaints!</li>
    <li> Holy smokes this works like a charm!! Waaaaaay better than using eyebrow tweezers!! Sometimes this hairbtweezer can remove ingrown hairs that I can barely see!! Definitely worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> great little pr tweezers however did nt find very useful for removing facial hair but would make a great additition for a first aide kit</li>
    <li> Hmmm.. the first time I used them they were great. The second and followup times they barely gripped (clean dry skin). I gave 2 stars because i could have gotten a bad pair.</li>
    <li> 9/24/14: The redesigned tweezers are excellent with a strong grip for removing ingrown hairs. They get the job done without being overly sharp on the points like some brands that have ended up cutting up my skin. When I received the original tweezers in July, I gave them a 2-star rating and a bad review. Majestic Bombay is a concerned seller who wrote me to say they had redesigned the tweezers and mailed me a replacement pair at no charge. The redesign made all the difference. I like these tweezers and use them daily. I appreciate Majestic Bombay&#x27;s excellent customer service in taking extra steps to make sure customers enjoy their products. I consider myself somewhat of a tweezer connoisseur and have tried many brands and types, and this is an excellent tweezer. Here&#x27;s a tip I&#x27;ve learned along the way: Clean the points with alcohol every time before using. Alcohol doesn&#x27;t just kill germs. It removes oils for the best grip.</li>
    <li> Great value.  I purchased these tweezers for about $10.  They work well and have nice grasp for fine hairs.  They came nicely packed with a sleeve and a cover over the sharp point.  I must admit that I haven&#x27;t used them for long, but the tweezers have been reliable and there is no problem with grasping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Cheap garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I unfortunately bought these because I did not want to spend the extra money on a Tweezerman product, and I regretted it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are cheaply constructed, and will not pull and keep holding something that is small and resists the pressure of being pulled away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spend the extra few dollars and get a Tweezerman product instead.</li>
    <li> Best pair of tweezers I have purchased, gets those fine hairs easily. Also good to just nip a skin imperfection, ingrown hairs and remove splinters.  I have tried blunt tweezers, slanted tweezers, pointy tweezers, chiseled tweezers, cheap tweezers, and expensive tweezers. While some are OK/good tweezers, this is my go to pair of tweezers. The quality seems wonderful, so I fully expect to get several years of good use from them. I&#x27;m considering several other pairs, one for my travel case and one as a back-up. I truly do not want to be without a pair of tweezers like this. Please be careful with this pair of tweezers, they are very pointy and sharp--which is what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and are very nice.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptic buying these after reading the bad reviews - the bad reviews are a joke - probably from their competitors - these&lt;br /&gt;tweezers look great not cheap looking - very sturdy - works great for splinters (large or small) eyebrows and ingrown hairs (does not cut the hair pulls right out) - yes I used them for all three - and they are aligned perfectly with very sharp pointed tips (not fat at all) - so look out other top brand names that are selling similar tweezers for much higher prices - these tweezers are just as good. You can bet I will not be returning these tweezers -  Thank you seller you saved me a lot of money - mike</li>
    <li> This is a very good tweezers, especially if you are using it to remove splinters or ingrown hairs. I use it for jewelry fixes too. It has a good grip and I think it will stay sharp for a long time.</li>
    <li> Good product, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> These tweezers REALLY get the tiniest hairs out. Sometimes though, I have to use another pair of tweezers to remove the actual hair because the tip of the tweezers is so thin. The tweezers are magnificent in that they&#x27;re thin, and strong. What you have to understand though, is that because they are so thin, while they can extract the hair perfectly, they sometimes require a little extra help with those pesky thin hairs that make you dig at your skin until it turns pink. Great product though.</li>
    <li> great tweezer. thank you</li>
    <li> The tweezers did not grip</li>
    <li> Good tweezers delivered fast.</li>
    <li> Great tweezers and quick shipping. Thank you!</li>
    <li> great quality with a nice sharp point</li>
    <li> Was not effective in taking out very fine hair</li>
    <li> Great high quality product.</li>
    <li> great quality much better than tweezerman and half the price!</li>
    <li> Works perfectly. Sharl instant breaks skin and grabs you will need a nice tweezer to go with em</li>
    <li> tweezers were excellent quality, fast delivery. good price, especially compared to local pharmacy.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend Majestic Bombay.</li>
    <li> Great tweezers!  I love them a lot. Precise use and I received the order quickly.  I&#x27;ll definitely use this seller again.</li>
    <li> hard to find tweezer like this with sharp point...nice quality, would recommend!</li>
    <li> Not as sharp as I wanted and the grip on the hair is iffy</li>
    <li> perfect tweezers for those pesty ingrown hairs and slivers we seem to get as we age.</li>
    <li> Got a splinter out quickly! He had no pain!</li>
    <li> The original tweezers I received didn&#x27;t quite work as well I as expected.  I advised the seller of the problem, and a replacement was sent which works just fine.  A good set of tweezers for ingrown hair removal - just note that they are designed to grip at the tip.  Different tweezers would be needed to grip a larger area.</li>
    <li> Tweez&#x27;em are not bad, they are larger than tweezerman version, so it comes with some pros and cons. On one hand, its better when used for splinters and larger hair, but for really tiny hair, you need to apply more pressure to avoid slipping. Holding tweezers closer to the gripping tips will also help avoid annoying slipping.&lt;br /&gt;Also want to point out that Majestic Bombay folks are quite responsive and sent me a replacement when my first unit was not working as expected. Overall well deserved 4 stars.</li>
    <li> Fast service and nice tweezers for the money.</li>
    <li> Product meets exactly what was described and delivered. Great product.</li>
    <li> Loved their customer support as well as this product, very durable, not flimsy and cheap looking/feeling.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and great product. The business owners are wonderful, I plan on ordering from them in the future.</li>
    <li> I was in a hurry and not paying close attention..  I got this to replace one that I dropped onto a tile floor and tweaked the tip.  I know that tweezerman has the life time guarantee, but figured that it was my mistake so didn&#x27;t look into that, but wish I had.  These are okay and work, but they are not as precise as my old one was.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the tweezers.  I am able to remove splinters very easily now &amp; the work great on my eyebrows too.</li>
    <li> these tweezers do not work at all. Can&#x27;t get it to pluck any hair at all. Please don&#x27;t buy, it&#x27;s a bad product. I would give it zero stars if it was up to me</li>
    <li> just the thing for slivers good addition to the workshop</li>
    <li> You can pick pretty much any hair follicle out with this bad boy, I bought two of these as soon as I saw it. They are very useful in many ways. My girlfriend loves using the one I got her.</li>
    <li> This is the first pair of tweezers I&#x27;ve ever bought, and they&#x27;re wonderful for my computer room, to get where my pliers can&#x27;t. I&#x27;m thinking about trying them on my unibrow!</li>
    <li> Its so rare to find something high quality these days. These are fantastic and look to last forever. I wish Tweezit made more products.</li>
    <li> Tweezers are one of the products where there are a couple of great brands and then most others are junk, these are great and at a great price too.</li>
    <li> Nice sturdy construction, but be aware that the tip is very tiny, so it is difficult to grab hairs.</li>
    <li> HOLY COW!!! I love it.  It&#x27;s a zit picker, pimple popper, Ingrown hair excavator&#x27;s dream!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought one.  Loved it, bought two more.  One for a friend and one for work!!!</li>
    <li> I was surprised by how sharp these tweezers actually are, but that&#x27;s the point, of course! Highly effective tweezers, for general hair plucking or for digging out splinters. Gets the job done, and in a pretty color! Just be sure to keep them in the case when not in use... they could probably be a little dangerous in the wrong hands.</li>
    <li> These are awesome. They are great with getting those pesky little hairs that are ingrown or hard to reach. They also do a great job with splinter removal.</li>
    <li> Where have these been all of my life? They were just what I have needed for so long. I may just order a back up pair just to keep around.</li>
    <li> Strong and sharp. Would buy again</li>
    <li> I have been  unable to remove a single hair with these &amp;#34;tweezers&amp;#34;.  They will not grab a hold of the hair no matter how hard I try.</li>
    <li> I received these tweezers free for testing/reviewing purposes from Tomoson. All views are my own.  I have to say when I saw the tips I was very confused my something so slender and then I used them. I am converted. I will never go back to another other tweezers and will be purchasing several more sets of these.</li>
    <li> I started using an epilator earlier this year and was getting lots of red bumps on my legs that were itchy and irritated. I thought at first it was a rash, but it turns out I had some ingrown hairs. I had regular tweezers I tried to use to get them out, but the tweezers would cause a bigger red mark or break off the hair instead of pulling it out the way it should. I did some research and found out I needed special tweezers, and ordered one from this company. The tweezers sold here are high quality, well made, and do exactly the job they were created to do. They&#x27;re super sharp and get right to the hair and are able to pull the hair out from the root, without making a big red scab like regular tweezers can sometimes do. The ingrown hair can be super tiny as well, but these tweezers will nab that baby right out. No trouble. Highly recommend them to anyone looking for a reliable method of getting rid of ingrown hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because the return prices was so easy, but this was VERY sharp - it actually cuts the skin!</li>
    <li> Great tweezer and appears to be the same as the more expensive brands.  Will be buying another one with my next order to Amazon.</li>
    <li> I usually buy tweezerman tweezers.  I am a cosmetologist and do eyebrow waxing. These tweezers are equal if not better (so far). I have used them several times for the tiny short hairs that waxing cannot get. I would definitely recommend this brand.</li>
    <li> Great product and Great service!  Thank you</li>
    <li> I am returning these because I am used to the sharpness of my tewwzerman ingrown hair tweezers. These are better than the average tweezers but are inferior to the very sharp tweezerman.</li>
    <li> I needed tweezers that could get small course hair so I pick these up. They are HUGE!!! My hand can barely grip them. They work pretty good, just really awkward to hold. Still can&#x27;t get over how big that are!</li>
    <li> Great tweezers. You have to really grab the hair to use them. Still need tweezers with larger edge for most hairs. Perfect for ingrown hairs, short stubby hairs, splinters and small intricate uses. Nice &amp; sharp. Tweezers tips match up WONDERFULLY! Worth the $$!</li>
    <li> Works well for getting in deep but grip strength is a little weak. Overall good product though.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this tweezer, but it doesn&#x27;t do a good job at getting ingrown hairs. The pointed tip isn&#x27;t sharp or pointed enough. Tweezerman used to make tweezers that had a very fine point and they were GREAT...I haven&#x27;t been able to find any! This tweezer needs to have a thinner and pointier tweezer tip.</li>
    <li> Not all that. Did not grip ingrown hairs like the product description claims.</li>
    <li> Poor knock-off of actual tweezerman brand.  These do NOT work like tweezerman product. Does not properly grasp and hold onto the hair for proper removal.  These look like tweezerman in the photo but as soon as I opened the package I could tell they were not what I thought I was ordering.  This company is tricking customers into believing these are the wonderful yellow tweezerman product, but its definitely NOT.</li>
    <li> Love them, they get all the ingrown hairs..</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the product. Didn&#x27;t work as well as the other color coated brands. Doesn&#x27;t capture the hair.</li>
    <li> Worked GREAT ... For a few hours and then was so dull it wouldn&#x27;t tweeze even a single hair!!!  Do not purchase this item!!!</li>
    <li> These are good, not quite as sharp or good as tweezerman, but will work for most splinter needs.</li>
    <li> I purchased these tweezers on a whim, to get free shipping on another item, but am very glad I did. They work well and were worth the money.</li>
    <li> Super for getting those tiny hairs that grow under the eyebrows!</li>
    <li> These work great on splinters and those pesky stray hairs thst appear on your face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Tweezermans for years, but needed a replacement. Don&#x27;t you just hate it when you&#x27;re trying to pluck your eyebrows but your worn out tweezers just won&#x27;t grab the hair? I do! Decided to try this pair out from Majestic Bombay. These are great tweezers! I can get every single teeny tiny fine hair for clean looking brows. I love how sharp of a point they have (be careful not to stab yourself) and the bright yellow color makes them easy to find in my makeup drawer. My husband uses them too and we&#x27;re both really happy with the product. Great quality at a great price! Will definitely reorder in the future.</li>
    <li> This item works well, it helps me a lot, including getting a small component out of a deep hole, and taking a length of hair out of my hand.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m constantly dealing with ingrown hairs, but this tool cuts down on the amount of time I spend in the mirror. Makes dealing with ingrown hairs less of a chore.</li>
    <li> just what I was looking for. Thanks.</li>
    <li> These are great!  They have an extremely fine tip which is exactly what I wanted.  Great product.</li>
    <li> This Tweezer is GREAT!&lt;br /&gt;I have in grown hairs for 30 years, everyday.&lt;br /&gt;This product works great.&lt;br /&gt;If you have this same problem, buy this you will be glad you did!</li>
    <li> My Wife &amp; I have recently removed the Carpets in our home and until we can get the Floors sanded we will need somewhat occasional splinter removal. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this Tweezers!</li>
    <li> These tweezers are great! They&#x27;re very sharp and sturdy, making them perfect for pulling ingrown hairs without a lot of effort</li>
    <li> These are junk. The tips do not align. When you squeeze the tweezers the end of tips do not make contact with eachother. The tips actually splay away from eachother. Returned immediately. These are not branded - instead foreign generic knock offs.</li>
    <li> I love them! They work great, there&#x27;s nothing worse than tweezers that aren&#x27;t properly aligned, but thankfully these do NOT have that problem. Great value for the price.</li>
    <li> Item was delivered on time and of good quality.  Great buy!</li>
    <li> These tweezers are amazing!  We live out in the country in a very dry climate and my kids are constantly getting splinters or stickers from cacti.  They used to hate having to get the splinters out, but the first time I used this pair, it got the job done so quickly, my child barely had time to get nervous.  Awesome!  I will always have a pair of these on hand and should probably get 1 or 2 for a backup just in case mine get lost.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are amazeballs. I think I am in love for real.</li>
    <li> Great pair of tweezers. we are hard on tweezers and were surprised at the quality for the price. I also like the hassle-free ordering Amazon Stores have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would purchase these again.</li>
    <li> Needed to find something as good or better!&lt;br /&gt;THESE ARE BEST EVER! So pleased to have found them...</li>
    <li> They are just ok. They pluck fine but aren&#x27;t anything amazing. I have had better for cheaper, but they do the job and are better than a lot of tweezers out there.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, these are anything but pointy the tips are blunt. They will end up damaging the surrounding skin.</li>
    <li> Great tweezers for getting those pesky short hairs. I don&#x27;t think I could use it all over for everything just because it is so small and can be hard to get in the right spot.</li>
    <li> Awesome for picking un-shed skin off geckos!</li>
    <li> I run a summer camp and deal with a lot of splinter removals. Most tweezers are too thick to get at the splinters I try to take out. These are perfect!</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t work for me.  My eyebrow hair is really thin and it doesn&#x27;t work as well as other Tweezers.  if you have thick hair it may work...</li>
    <li> I am a guy.. I sometimes forget to wear the proper gloves for the job.. With that being said..  I am always getting poked by something.. Weed prickers, wood and metal slivers.  I bought two of these one for the first aid kit and one for the adult bathroom.  I am always using these to get those little annoying pokers out.  They are precise, easy to handle and get the job done.  I was using my wife&#x27;s classic make-up tweezers.. The kind were you dig around and bleed everywhere still that sliver stays.  Great product.</li>
    <li> As soon as I complained to Majestic Bombay they responded quickly and immediately sent me out a new one.  The new one works fine.  I wish everyone would respond so quickly to a customer.  Thank you</li>
    <li> I ordered one of these and it was absolutely fantastic. Unfortunately I dropped it and the tip bent. I loved it enough to order a replacement, but the replacement doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well! I&#x27;m not sure if the alignment is off or what but the second would not securely grip a hair.</li>
    <li> Sharp and gets the job done</li>
    <li> I came across these tweezers while I was searching for another item &amp; I thought they&#x27;d make a nice addition to my toolbox!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros:&lt;br /&gt;+ The shipping was free when I purchased mine.&lt;br /&gt;+ Stainless steel.&lt;br /&gt;+ Wide handles for easy use.&lt;br /&gt;+ Nice bright yellow color.&lt;br /&gt;+ These tweezers make a nice precision tool... pliers for my toolbox. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons:&lt;br /&gt;- $7.99 when I purchased mine &amp; I&#x27;m thinking 1/2 that price would be reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;- The point isn&#x27;t what I&#x27;d call sharp.&lt;br /&gt;- Not so sure these would be good for digging out ingrown hairs, unless you scrape it out or start with a sharp needle?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;► Update - February 9, 2014&lt;br /&gt;I used these on some radio wiring today &amp; they work great for precision pliers!  I decided to up my product rating to 4 out of 5. :)</li>
    <li> Very sleek, well made tweezers. Doesn&#x27;t get much better then these. Definitely a life long investment. Hopefully when I have kids and I need to pull out a splinter I will still have these around.</li>
    <li> My 1st review~i thought i purchased tweezerman! these were awful. do not work at all! not splinter tip! to wide! get the real tweezerman!    Hold the press! They resent for FREE a NEW improved pair and they worked great!!!  :)</li>
    <li> I got these tweezers and I enjoy them, so I must have gotten the newer, improved ones. Definitely sharp and easy to delicately break the skin to remove ingrown hairs. I&#x27;m sure they will work well on splinters too. If you are using them to tweeze eyebrows or other hair out, you must grab close to the root, at it is can just snap the hair if you pull by the top. Once I saw that if I grabbed by the root, I had no more problems. I don&#x27;t have any problems with how they align or grab. The one I received is very precise. I was gifted these tweezers in exchange for my unbiased opinion, and I find they help with ingrown hairs better than any other tweezers I have owned. I&#x27;ll stick to slanted for general eyebrow grooming. Although, the precision with these helps out after I&#x27;m done and you have those few hairs that are close together that you need to separate and pluck.</li>
    <li> I have yet to actually extract a hair with these tweezers. While the sharp tip helps to get to hard-to-access hairs, it can not \\&quot;grip\\&quot; the hair and pull it out - rendering it a useless tool. Maybe the name-brand Tweezerman version will yield better results...</li>
    <li> I had an old, crappy pair of tweezers that didn&#x27;t quite line up anymore. I thought these looked a bit nicer, with the wide mid section. I ordered them, put them in my first aid kit, and promptly forgot about this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, some time later, I needed to get a very small (2mm) glass splinter out of my foot. These tweezers made that much easier. I was able to get a solid grip on the tweezers without any real effort, and the well-machined &amp;#34;tweezing&amp;#34; end was perfect for grabbing a tiny, slippery piece of glass with ease. I will never put together a first aid or disaster kit without these tweezers ever again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been dealing with ingrown neck hair for longer than I&#x27;d like to remember so when I saw this specialized tweezer I figured why not give it a try.  It&#x27;s not overpriced and had good reviews so I ordered one.  Once I received it I was really happy with the quality of the materials and the sharpness of the ends.  I&#x27;ve been using it regularly for months and I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product and recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> TWEEZIT is the best tweezers I have ever used.  I was so pleasantly surprised when I used this product.  This product works PERFECTLY on in-grown hairs.  Other tweezers do not.  You have to \\&quot;fight\\&quot; with them, and usually end up bleeding from them.  I highly recommend this product.  I am definitely a permanent customer of this unique and great tweezers.</li>
    <li> I really like these.  The point makes it easy to grab the tiny hairs.  I&#x27;ll be buying more real soon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a male, have eyebrows that need maintenance or they look disheveled.  So I had them waxed and the stylist recommended I buy a good pair of tweezers to maintain them.  I got these and they were awesome for about a month.  Not sure what happened, but now I can&#x27;t even get them to pull out one eyebrow hair.  I didn&#x27;t do anything to them and replaced the cap each and every time, they just don&#x27;t seem to work anymore.</li>
    <li> I was surprised to see an email mentioning that this company is pretty new. The construction of the tweezers are sturdy and easy to use. the tiny ends are very strong while also super sharp (so easy to grab any ingrown hairs or even better for splinters!). The only thing that&#x27;s almost a testament to it being too well made is that the edges are pretty sharp, so if you pull on a hair the wrong direction you can just cut it short. The tweezers come with a thick plastic cover for the sharp end too for safety. Overall a great and professional level product.</li>
    <li> These are great tweezers.  The quality seems top notch - if they were sold to me as \\&quot;Tweezerman\\&quot; brand I would not question it at all.  However, the price is far more reasonable.  Great buy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:  It&#x27;s been a couple months now and the paint is peeling a bit at the back of the tweezers.  So there is a bit of a quality difference between these and the more expensive brand.  Given how infrequently I use these tweezers, it&#x27;s not a big deal but I&#x27;m deducting one star from my previous review.</li>
    <li> Solid product and works well at removing stubborn ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for ingrown hair, straight to the point…!!</li>
    <li> Great for ingrowns. Precision tweeze.</li>
    <li> I like the price and quality, but I thought I was getting tweezerman.</li>
    <li> Surprisingly, they were fine... gets the job done!!</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised... the best tweezers around for plucking out those pesky in-grown hairs! Sharp as a needle, and definitely a good, quality build. Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Tips are not as strong or lined up. The tips can bend if you put too much pressure.</li>
    <li> The tip of the tweezers twisted right away.</li>
    <li> The best there is to remove slivers. Worked so good I bought another one.</li>
    <li> I was oringinally looking for tweezerman and found this almost identical brand for a little cheaper and thought why not.  I really am pleased with my purchase as I had in the past purchased a pair of approx.$32.00 tweezers and they broke.  So, price was right!!!</li>
    <li> Work okay for getting ingrown hairs to the surface (which is why i bought them) but are waaaaay too sharp for their own good and end up cutting the hair instead of plucking it most of the time, and i stab my fingers with is and cut myself all the time becausd they are incredibly sharp. They would be perfect if they were just the slightest bit duller</li>
    <li> Work great! No complaints.</li>
    <li> Dull and have about a micrometer where they come together enough to pluck hairs</li>
    <li> I received these tweezers quickly and well packaged.  Excellent quality at a good price.</li>
    <li> An excellent, well-built product effective in removing wood splinters. Recommended.</li>
    <li> Original: Not impressed. Tips don&#x27;t line up well enough to be functional. Don&#x27;t waste your money.    Edit: I was sent a replacement, randomly in the mail. No info included but I assume from the manufacturer based on my previous review. The new item is much improved over the initial product I received. The new item would be a 5 star, but since that isn&#x27;t what I received initially- and took 4 months to get a functional pair, they only get a 4 from me.</li>
    <li> Had bought several other brands from pharmacy, Ulta, Target and they didn&#x27;t get the job done. This is the first tweezer I&#x27;ve owned in a long time, that works the way it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
    <li> Best pointed tweezer I have ever had ! Even better than my expensive tweezerman tweezers! Definitely worth the money !</li>
    <li> As an African American I frequently am victim to those darn ingrown hairs. I previously was using another brand&#x27;s tweezers and they were expensive and flimsy. So flimsy in fact that I&#x27;ve had to replace them a several times. I&#x27;m so happy that I discovered Tweez&#x27;em. I&#x27;ll never go back to that other brand. Tweez&#x27;em are sturdy and solidly constructed. A definite must have!</li>
    <li> These are fake Tweezerman ingrown hair tweezers.  I was tricked into buying them and as soon as I opened the package, realized my mistake.  They&#x27;re not true ingrown hair tweezers, the points are way too fat.  They&#x27;re cheap drug store tweezers.  They&#x27;re hard to close, totally ineffective on ingrown hairs, and not even particularly good for regular tweezers.  Total crap and profiting off their similar appearance/name to the Tweezerman ones.</li>
    <li> I use these tweezers along with a blackhead extractor to pull keratin plugs and ingrown hair. The squeeze tension is perfect and the tip points are very fine. No problem getting into tight spots. Also, construction is solid.</li>
    <li> Read the other reviews raving about this, but was totally disappointed upon receipt.  Tweezer ends are too small/fine to grasp and pull stray hairs.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> - Very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Good product, high quality, good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- They work very good for removing wood splinters from the hands.</li>
    <li> This work really well for ingrown hairs.  The ends are razor sharp and can easily dig the hairs out.  When tweezing, sometimes the hairs slip out, but none of my other tweezers can get the really stubborn hairs either.</li>
    <li> It cuts the hair instead of pulling it out. I am returning it. I do not recommend this one to anyone used to precise tweezers.</li>
    <li> This is the best tweezer I have ever purchased! I don&#x27;t think I will ever go back to getting my eyebrows waxed because this thing does the job and more. It gets every single hair I pluck and even the little one that are barely starting to grow out. I will recommend these to every person who wants a good pair of tweezers.</li>
    <li> Heavy duty tweezers with a nice fine point. I use them to pull out ingrown hairs/remove splinters and these work much better than the normal tweezers I got from the local pharmacy.</li>
    <li> Decent set.  Does just what you needed and is a good price.  Tip does bend easily so use the rubber protector that comes with the product.</li>
    <li> I had my doubts, but it really worked where others had failed. Ingrown hairs have met their match. Thank you.</li>
    <li> The first pair I bought were excellent. Then I used it to remove ticks from my cat, and I wanted a new one for myself.  I ordered the exact same thing, but this time, the points were not properly aligned. So I returned it (no problem with that), and ordered a third one.  The third one also was not well aligned, and did not grip the hair (I could get a hair between the points, and it would be touching the hair, but it would slide right off of it).  So, I returned the third one (also, with no problem).  So, I am buying a tweezerman instead, since I really need to shape my brows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When they are aligned properly, these tweezers are really very good. Very pointy, which helps to get new growth that comes in under the skin.  I also used it for removing a splinter, and, as discussed above, for tick removal.</li>
    <li> I bought these for surfing in Indonesia- where I always manage to get an urchin spine or small piece of corral trapped deep in my foot.  These are perfect &amp;#34;backyard surgery&amp;#34; tweezers.  Precise and small enough to remove deeply lodged debris.  Definitely the best tweezers I have owned.  Going back to Indo with confidence this time!  The only reason I would not buy these is if you want a wide, flat tip.  But for me, tweezers are all about precision.  These are perfect.  Buy now.</li>
    <li> This looks like a knock-off. It doesn&#x27;t even say TWEEZIT on the said, the one I received says MAJESTIC BOMBAY instead. But worst, they are nowhere as sharp as the tweezers in the picture. Should I gone Tweezerman I guess.</li>
    <li> these are very nice, high quality, VERY sharp tweezers.  i recommend them to anyone looking for good quality very sharp tweezers.</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace a lost Tweezerman of similar design. The tip of these are misaligned, so I can&#x27;t get a grip on any ingrown hairs with any strength. I&#x27;m going back to Tweezerman.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality.  A precise grip, just what I needed!</li>
    <li> So far, so good! Worth the money. We got two just to be safe and they both work great.</li>
    <li> Very fine tweezers (sharp!), good for all sorts of delicate uses.  Grip is good, and the yellow color makes them easy to find.</li>
    <li> I use these for crafting, actually for vinyl and for Heat transfer vinyl. They are awesome for picking up the small cuts and the letter fills.</li>
    <li> I hace purchased this twice and love it. They are cheaper than the same model high end tweezers (which I&#x27;ve bought) and I belive they are better and longer lasting. I defenately recommend this item for stubborn, harder to grasp hairs. Hope this helped!!</li>
    <li> We are so happy with our purchase. This tweezer compares perfectly to a similar, higher priced item.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast, everything was perfect.</li>
    <li> These are only ok because they break hairs off rather than pull them out but do like the fine tip.</li>
    <li> The metal material these tweezers are made with is good and strong for long term tweezing. Other tweezers I&#x27;ve had tend to lose their tip shape after a month or so and then don&#x27;t grip the smaller hair follicles as well, causing me to have to file and smooth them again such that they are sharp, pointy, and flat inside to grip hair properly. The &#x27;only&#x27; issue I&#x27;ve had with these tweezers is that the yellow painted covering tend to flake off slowly and constantly after a month or so, and thus leaves yellow flakes periodically when used. Of the two I&#x27;ve purchased, I filed off the yellow paint on one tweezer (on the left in the picture) to prevent any additional flakes from coming off. As you can see in the attached picture (the tweezers on the right) are losing their yellow covering as well. If this could be resolved, I could score these tweezers with a 5 star. Until then I would like to score them as a 3.5.</li>
    <li> These are great for the money. No QC problems. As good as any.</li>
    <li> My husband LOVES these tweezers. A must have for ingrown hairs. Got my brother a pair for Christmas and he loves them as well!</li>
    <li> Bought the tweezers for ingrown chin hairs and I wanted something with a thin sharp point.  These work great!  Sharp point that does not gouge extra skin. Price very good.  I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I really like these tweezers! The tips come together very closely and I&#x27;ve been able to pull out a couple of hairs before they have become truly visible. The widened arms help with grip- most needle-nose tweezers are very thin and I find it difficult to use them. I would say that these are equal to the tweezerman sets I have used in the past.</li>
    <li> These are firm sturdy tweezers that definitely get the job done. My worry when purchasing these was that they would be weak tweezers that were unable to reliably hold a hair, and for the price, I&#x27;d be able to absorb the cost if they were. Much to my surprise these tweezers feel and handle like a pair of premium tweezers. Well done.</li>
    <li> These were a gift -- exactly what we were looking for. great quality, easy to use. What can you say? They&#x27;re tweezers, and they work.</li>
    <li> does not tweeze as advetised</li>
    <li> Precision made, and very durable. Much better than drug store brands. I would recommend and buy again.</li>
    <li> Good price and works great!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, good price, exactly what I needed. A very thoughtful follow-up came from the seller and was much appreciated.</li>
    <li> These seem like really good tweezers...  But I haven&#x27;t had to use them for an ingrown hair.  Just before I bought them I switched from multi-blade cartridge razors (which cause ingrown hairs) to traditional double edge safety razors.  I have not had a single solitary ingrown hair since switching.  NEVER EVER again will a cartridge razor touch my face!  I highly recommend traditional double edge safety razors to everyone.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are the sharpest, stylish tweezers I&#x27;ve ever owned, I&#x27;ve gotten a ton of uses out of it so far.</li>
    <li> Great but be careful --/Very sharp!</li>
    <li> I had my doubts about whether these would work any better than a plain pair of tweezers but they do. They have a very fine point. Finer than any other tweezer I&#x27;ve seen. They come with a protective cover over the tip and I recommend you keep it there when not in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also work great for untangling the wife&#x27;s fine gold chains!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for targeted eyebrow tweezing (especially when one is looking to pluck just one stray hair). Great grip and lasting well so far.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised with the quality:  very well made and for the price I was very happy with the workmanship.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these tweezers. Most inexpensive ones I own and the best ones I own all at the same damn time lol. Check out my youtube video where I included them in my monthly favorites video---&amp;#62;  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;fcEBrlkZ2NM</li>
    <li> good for ingrowns but breaks the hairs if you&#x27;re not careful</li>
    <li> Just got them and they feel very sturdy. I use them for eyebrow and ear hairs. So far the grip is good.&lt;br /&gt;They come with tip protectors and a plastic sleeve so I am hoping they keep their sharp point and last.&lt;br /&gt;The price seems very good for the feel of quality.</li>
    <li> I usually use slant-edge tweezers, so I wasn&#x27;t sure about these, but they&#x27;re great for plucking hair.  Those tips are SHARP!  Be careful if you go under the skin to get an ingrown hair, or you might suddenly bleed!  You could totally separate the halves and use them as a weapon!</li>
    <li> Seem like good quality...I can&#x27;t seem to nab my nosehairs, though ;o)</li>
    <li> Works great!  I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times for splinters - got them out when other tweezers couldn&#x27;t.  I&#x27;ve also used it for household tasks that requires threading thin lines through holes.</li>
    <li> Absolutely great tweezers.  Just what I was looking for.  I will certainly tell my friends and family to buy these.  I ordered another pair for my son.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband (as a stocking stuffer) and he really it! He sometimes gets ingrown hairs from shaving and was mostly unable to get them but with these he said it&#x27;s been a breeze.</li>
    <li> Tweezers are great! They have a sharp tip that can handle a l firm amount of pressure with out both sides of the tweezers collapsing. I&#x27;ve used them to pull a couple of splinters already and am very happy.</li>
    <li> I actually purchased these not with the intention to pluck splinters and hairs, but instead vinyl and decal materials. Needless to say, they work like a charm within my work flow and application. I&#x27;ve reduced my order fulfillment and tedious weeding times to half of what they used to be! I&#x27;ll surely purchase a few more pairs, in the future. My simple request: a few more colors to choose from.</li>
    <li> Good product. Prompt delivery</li>
    <li> Very, very sharp! I was going to use them for my brows, but am reserving them for the first aide kit.</li>
    <li> These are really heavy duty and have a nice fine tip. If you are expecting some dinky thin tin can like pair, think again. These are the biggest hand feel pair of tweezers I&#x27;ve ever owned that had such a micro-fine point. These outstanding to get out the smallest of spinters or hairs. I got a piece of really small glass shard out of my husbands large toe with these that other pair could not hold on to. These will be around a while - they are not easily bent or worn either. Easy to grip if you have fine motor control issues. Two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice size,  too, long enough to handle easily but not too big. I keep it nearby because it&#x27;s great for lots of things; not just splinters</li>
    <li> This tweezer doesn&#x27;t work at all!  Can&#x27;t grasp eyebrow hairs.  The points appear to come together, but they obviously don&#x27;t because they are an Epic Fail.</li>
    <li> Sorry for the bad review, but these just don&#x27;t grasp the hair.  I can grab the hair, but everytime I pull it keeps slipping out of these tweezers. Literally doesn&#x27;t help me at all... very disappointed.</li>
    <li> For the price, these are nice fine point tweezers.  I was honestly most impressed by Majestic Bombay themselves.  After I reported that my tweezers were satisfactory but not quite what I was hoping for, they immediately sent a replacement at no charge.  The replacement points were noticeably more fine and and more like what I had in mind when making the purchase.  I would buy again.</li>
    <li> These are terrible tweezers. I have a pair similar to these but they became unaligned. These do not grab anything and are virtually useless. I would not purchase these again. Very poor quality.</li>
    <li> it is huge, it ended up in my garage with other tools.</li>
    <li> Love the true pointed ends. Seller was so easy to deal with. Stayed in touch. Highly recommend them for splinters and ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> Very fine point.  Very solid build.</li>
    <li> I bought the tweezerman brand initially for my wife, and she loves that one. I wanted to pick up another pair for a first aid kit (for splinters and such) but I didn&#x27;t really want to pay the tweezerman price again. I got these instead and comparing the 2 side by side they are nearly identical. These work just as well as the tweezerman ones.</li>
    <li> Good to use in the very small ones!!!</li>
    <li> There are terrible compared to the Tweezermans. I have zero use for these tweezers - they don&#x27;t grab hair at all. You get what you pay for I suppose.</li>
    <li> very good quality, good service and follow up.</li>
    <li> Not much to say about these except they are perfect for my job at hand: removing latched-on deer ticks.</li>
    <li> I loved these tweezers for how sharp they are and how precise they are. They&#x27;re definitely not all purpose tweezers, but for those pesky splinters, they&#x27;re amazing. I grew up learning how to use a sterile needle and standard tweezers to pry wood splinters out of my feet. These are definitely far superior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: My opinion is 100% thoroughly thought out and honest. I was not paid for this review, however,  thank you Majestic Bombay for sending these to me to try out for review here and on my blog.</li>
    <li> Tweezer head is not very sharp; it&#x27;s very rough. I have yet to be able to remove a splinter without difficulty.</li>
    <li> These work great! Highly recommended.  08/2015 Update: I loved the first pair of these I got so I thought I&#x27;d grab another pair for a backup. The second pair doesn&#x27;t work for squat. Won&#x27;t grab a hair or splinter unless exactly positioned in a very very small sweet spot at the tip. My original pair does not suffer from this flaw. It will grab anything within the entire silver part of the tip, not just the tiniest little front part. Too bad, I really dig the first ones. Must be a quality control thing.</li>
    <li> Works really well in removing all sorts of hair from thick to thin to hard to see. I&#x27;ve removed really fine splinters with it too, in just one go. However, it takes a lot of practice to get it just right because hair grows from all different directions and when trying to tweeze, it can break. The best way is to hold the tweezer firmly and try to pull from the base to pull the whole thing out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also sharp so you need to be careful. Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with it and use it almost every day.</li>
    <li> My first experience with fine pointed tweezers.  Sometimes a little hard for my old eyes to see what I am trying to pull.  But the tweezers have a good hold with minimal slippage.</li>
    <li> Purchased this because of the low price and the need for a good tweezers. Couldn&#x27;t be happier</li>
    <li> When I first received these tweezers I was disappointed.  While to the eye they seemed to touch at the tip, upon using them I realized there was not a firm grip at the tip.  There was, however, a firm grip further up the shaft (about half a centimeter from the tip).  I received an email from the seller asking if I was pleased with my purchase, &amp; I responded citing my issue with the tweezers.  The seller replied very quickly, saying they would send me a new pair of tweezers at no cost.  I received the replacement tweezers a few days later &amp; have been very happy with them.  They have a fine tip &amp; a tight grip at the tip.  I am especially pleased with the seller&#x27;s outreach, quick response, &amp; eagerness to send me a product that I am pleased with.</li>
    <li> The tweezers works like a charm!  They are very sharp, which is great for getting even the tiniest ingrown hairs out.  Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> nice product.  Really works well when I want to get one hair out of my eyebrows.</li>
    <li> I would buy again if I lost these</li>
    <li> The best pair of tweezer I have ever used. I read the bad reviews and decided to try them anyway and glad I did. Mine are aligned correctly and I have no trouble grasping the smallest of hairs. They work for me and for me that is what counts.</li>
    <li> Point was not sharp enough to pull ingrown hairs.  No comparison at all to the Tweezerman pointed tweezer.  Rather pay more money and get the better product.</li>
    <li> Returned same day I received them. Worse tweezers I have ever bought. Update to original review. Company emailed me wanting to send a new improved tweezers to me to try again. New tweezers actually work very happy with new pair.  Customer service is definitely 5 stars.</li>
    <li> One of the best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever used. There is enough &amp;#34;spring&amp;#34; action yet it is sturdy enough to grasp and hold a hair without it slipping through or breaking off before getting pulled. I don&#x27;t have to spend a lot of time tweezing and no longer get ingrown hairs. Perfect for tweezing both eyebrows and chin hairs.</li>
    <li> This is definitely not as good as the Tweezerman version that it is copying. The tip is not nearly as precise and it&#x27;s also a bit crudely ground. I would not buy this again - I&#x27;d much rather get the Tweezerman version.</li>
    <li> Nice sharp tweezers. My wife uses one set for weeding vinyl stickers and the other is used for bathroom stuff. These things are REALLY sharp. Only downside is, if dropped, and the tip hits, they will bend really easily. I half expected that to happen because of how pointy they are. Don&#x27;t drop them and they are fine. I also like how wide the middle is, easy to grip.</li>
    <li> I had a hard time grabbing onto the hair with these. It took me a lot longer to manage my eyebrows than usual with this product.  If you have a lot of time, and patience these might work for you. Otherwise I would try a different tweezer.</li>
    <li> great pair of tweezers, can pluck the smallest of hairs</li>
    <li> These tweezers are really awesome. The points are super sharp which helps for the ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> End does not grab hair well. Have to attempt 2 or three times to have success if at all.</li>
    <li> These are very good. Perfect for pulling single hard to grab hairs. Very sharp and tough to keep tips perfect. Recommend keeping rubber tip the come with on them during storage. I have bought $30 tweezermans and I like these better.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of trouble with ingrown hairs from shaving. I recently bought these tweezers. They work real well to pull out the hairs under the skin. I would really recommend these to anyone that has ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> I LOVE these! I am forever taking splinters out of my kids hands and it&#x27;s no fun having to poke around. These take away the sting ... literally and figuratively. Great buy</li>
    <li> High quality product!</li>
    <li> Good product, arrived as scheduled.  A+</li>
    <li> Fine point, great price and solid construction. Never owned a pair of tweezers like this and will never need to buy another pair.</li>
    <li> Needle nose tweezers are always a tricky item.  While these do work, they my favorite pair tweezers.  I give them a 4 because I really like them for crafts.</li>
    <li> definitely not for ingrown or anything</li>
    <li> I purchased these tweezers because I have ingrown hairs and got tired or trying to find them.  These works wonders.  They get the hair from the tip and don&#x27;t hurt trying to grab. Thanks for the tweezers.</li>
    <li> Excellent.  Very strong grip.  Since these are sharp (which is good!) comes with case and tip cover.  Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> excellent product!!!  a++</li>
    <li> I LOVE these tweezers. Get them. Splurge. It&#x27;s worth it!!</li>
    <li> Great pair of tweezers!</li>
    <li> I needed a cheap pair of tweezers for some precision soldering in the garage. It would&#x27;ve been hard to justify buying a brand new set of tweezers for that task, so I bought these for my wife, and stole the set she had been complaining  about. Now we&#x27;re both happy. She says these are by far the best tweezers she&#x27;s ever owned. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Absolutely worthless, do not buy unless you want to throw away $10. it could not grab long hairs, much less anything ingrown!</li>
    <li> I expected these to be average based on the price, but these are my favorite tweezers. I keep my beard at about 1 inch in length, and these are really good for getting any crazy hairs, or fuzzy eyebrows. Very pointy, and not to flexible which is a good thing because they grab firmly.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are great!&lt;br /&gt;The ends meet perfectly and they grab on to hairs instantly.&lt;br /&gt;After the birth of my son, I began growing practically a whole beard. (Okay, maybe its just a few stray hairs, but it feels like a full blown beard to me. Another thing they don&#x27;t tell you about when you&#x27;re expecting. Lol.)&lt;br /&gt;I love that they are big enough to really grasp in your hand.</li>
    <li> I love it.  Best pair of tweezers that I have ever had.  Will be getting two more pairs for my sister and my mother.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are a well made, precision instrument at a very good price. I don&#x27;t believe you would get anything better if you spent more!</li>
    <li> It does the job.  They are sharp.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this purchase. My favorite tweezers of 15+ years all of a sudden stopped working, so I was in need of a good replacement. After a few failed purchases I tried Majestic Bombay. The tip is sharp and soft at the same time. I&#x27;ve found my new favorite tweezers!</li>
    <li> Not as sharp as original tweezer man buy the original.</li>
    <li> I love this tweezer. This is the escond one i bought&lt;br /&gt;I use it in my beauty shop to lift  the ingrown hairs when I do waxing on my clients.&lt;br /&gt;I Highly recommend it</li>
    <li> Nice design but the tips are not &#x27;fine&#x27; enough to accomplish what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Beautiful tweezers. Thank you for the prompt delivery,</li>
    <li> These tweezers arrived in very good time an were jus as the pic advertised. They were brand new.</li>
    <li> The tips of the tweezers are sharp but don&#x27;t contact each other well so their function as tweezers is essentially useless.</li>
    <li> Best tweezers ive ever had. They work awesome</li>
    <li> Great tweezers. Has a very precise tip which was what I was looking for. Good craftsmanship. Great price to go along with it. Five stars</li>
    <li> Excellent tweezers. They easily get the very fine hairs.</li>
    <li> I bought these to replace a pair of tweezermans which I&#x27;d dropped, bending the tip. These had better reviews, and a lower price, so it was a no-brainer to order them. I wish I hadn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They arrived yesterday, and I tried them out this morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They require a very light touch. If you look closely, you see that the way the metal is curve makes the end points actually pull away from each other if you squeeze too far. So you have to make sure you&#x27;re squeezing less than that. For me, that means holding them not at the widest part of the handle, but awkwardly further toward the tip. Very poor design for a precision instrument.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even once you get the pressure right, they&#x27;re not very grippy. Hairs that I&#x27;d have no problem with using the tweezermans, either break off or slip through with these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another negative is that the point isn&#x27;t as fine as the tweezermans. If I were to use these to remove a splinter under the skin, or an ingrown hair, it would be much more difficult to do since they&#x27;re much blunter.</li>
    <li> Great seller! He takes pride in his products.  I would recommend this product and I don&#x27;t write reviews all that often. So... take it for what it&#x27;s worth :-) Thanks!</li>
    <li> Tip was not aligned properly and would not work. I sent these tweezers back. Customer service and shipping was, however, excellent.</li>
    <li> Perfect tool.  Exactly what I needed.  Sharp with a good grip.</li>
    <li> Great item, price and seller!</li>
    <li> I am a tweezer SNOB. I have exclusively purchased tweezerman brand tweezers all my life and this is my first pair of another brand. They are great! The area where the tips make contact is most of the tweezer head length up to the enamel. I&#x27;m not personally a big fan of tools that are painted, I like all-metal tools for cleanliness/sterilization but this is a good set of tweezers and gets ingrown hairs missed from shaving your legs without scarring your skin. Take it from me I own over 13 pairs of specific types of tweezers. You should have these in your drawer!</li>
    <li> product was just as depicted on the site and arrived on time. Good job</li>
    <li> Came on time.  Excellent product</li>
    <li> They are just what I needed to remove ingrown eye lash.  A very nice product.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Love it.  Hard to find item available (as usual) on Amazon.</li>
    <li> these work really great for ingrown hairs!</li>
    <li> these are super tweezers.  They arrived in a couple of days.  Highly recommend them.  I bought 3 pairs.</li>
    <li> Very good tweez and for the price much better Im a hairy person I have a ot of hair in my face and these tweez work amazing getting out the hair with out brake it . Fast shipping</li>
    <li> I personally have a pair of these and use them daily for crafting and assembling! Had to get another set for my friend who does A LOT of vinyl projects. She loves how small of items you can pick up without issue and how easy it is to assemble using these! Great for so many applications&lt;br /&gt;http://craftycompliments.com/product-reviews/</li>
    <li> These tweezers are magic - my husband is a carpenter and comes home with splinters daily..this tool is not only sharp, but it handles very easily. Well done and thank you... oh and the shipping was very quick!</li>
    <li> This is truly an amazing set of tweezers. Normally I wouldn&#x27;t bother to post about a product as mundane as tweezers, but these are just THE BEST for ingrown hair removal.  They work far better to painlessly and quickly remove ingrown hairs than any needle or regular set of tweezers.  They also feel very high quality - I&#x27;ll probably have them for the rest of my life.  Very affordable, and by far well worth buying!</li>
    <li> Came fast and was exactly what they said it was.</li>
