      <li>But, this different it leaves your skin feeling soft yet not perfumey.</li>
      <li>Good soap as Ivory usually is, but for some reason these bath size bars are smaller than usual.  </li>
      <li>Other reviewers have described the smell as intense, overwhelming, and overpowering, and I&#x27;m sorry to say I agree -- so much so that I gave the four Aloe bars away as soon as possible and ordered the regular soap instead.  </li>
      <li>Does not dry your skin out.</li>
      <li>I think it dissolves a little faster than basic Ivory, but not too much -- not like glycerin soaps do.  </li>

    <li> Good soap.  I typically use the basic Ivory soap due to sensitivities with dyes/perfumes.  I think I&#x27;ll have to go back to basic Ivory, but I&#x27;m giving this a try for now.  Very light clean scent, and seems to moisturize a bit as well.  I think it dissolves a little faster than basic Ivory, but not too much -- not like glycerin soaps do.  Still a good bargain for your money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve removed most chemicals from my household, so maybe my nose is extra sensitive, but the fragrance used in this soap is overpowering. I will not buy this again once we use it up.</li>
    <li> Been using liquid soaps for a while but made the switch back to bar soaps.  Smells great!</li>
    <li> Great smell, clean, pure and inexpensive.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Great very pleasant smell ,I like the arrival when I need it</li>
    <li> Ivory soap is always good and mild. This one has a nice mild scent.</li>
    <li> I bought this soap as a gift for my brother as this is the only soap he will use.</li>
    <li> The same pure Ivory experience with a softer less-dry after effect. Highly recommend for adults and children.</li>
    <li> thought it was regular ivory, not a fan of aloe...that&#x27;s what it get for shopping with out my glasses</li>
    <li> My local market does not carry this variety of ivory soap. I keep a bar on my kitchen sink to use after the harsh detergents.</li>
    <li> one of my favorite smells</li>
    <li> I use this soap because of the aloe ingredient in the bar which makes one feel that it will help my skin.  I am a senior citizen and need all the help I can obtain as I am very fair -skinned and burn in the sun. It has a very pleasant odor and switch from the regular Ivory for a change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mrs. Carol J. Kirms</li>
    <li> great, exactly as described</li>
    <li> The sudsing power of Ivory hasn&#x27;t been lost as it is combined with the benefits of aloe.&lt;br /&gt;We like the goodness of Ivory and think this is even better than the original.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d rather get the 8 pack for the same price like they sold before</li>
    <li> Great quality soap that does not dry your skin out.</li>
    <li> I love Ivory soap and I love this scent, in fact I prefer it over the original.  Just a little different than the original but good for our family.</li>
    <li> I bought this soap for crafts- if you have children, put 1/2 bar in the microwave and it expands like a snake-- anyway, it did exactly what it should, but the smell was pretty intense.  It is a clean smell, but VERY overwhelming.  We also used it as regular soap.  It took awhile for the smell to go away-- which is good if you want that ivory fresh smell to last.</li>
    <li> This soap has a great fragrance and you can&#x27;t go wrong with Ivory soap!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for, an easy way to get items that I need monthly delivered.</li>
    <li> Nice soap, i don&#x27;t usually like ivory as i think it leaves your skin dry. But, this different it leaves your skin feeling soft yet not perfumey.</li>
    <li> Gentle cleansing. Does not dry your skin out.</li>
    <li> I always use ivory for my kids</li>
    <li> I really like this plain and simple soap. It used to be a bit cheaper, but now has the aloe additive and that seems to be nice on my skin. I have sensitive skin and also have acne, this seems to help. I have bought a few purchases of this soap and will buy more.</li>
    <li> Good soap as Ivory usually is, but for some reason these bath size bars are smaller than usual.  They&#x27;re a little larger than the regular bar size, though.</li>
    <li> I love this soap! It smells great and makes my skin feel nice. Fast delivery and well packaged!</li>
    <li> I have always used ivory.  I just liked the idea of soap with no perfumes or dyes, so i did have some trepidation when I first tried this.  I now perfer this over the regular type.  It has just a slight aloe smell that I like.  It is hard to find where I live so S&amp;S is perfect for me.</li>
    <li> Great product, no scent so does not attract insects.  The aloa also refreshens and moisturizers your skin.  Good value for your money.</li>
    <li> My husband won&#x27;t use any soap except Ivory. This is the first time I&#x27;ve bought Ivory with aloe. X X</li>
    <li> I use this soap to wash my baby after he poops. Very gentle on his skin. Absolutely no reaction.</li>
    <li> Good soap.  But I will no longer buy the price has skyrocketed.  I had the 10( 4oz ) on auto ship for 4.49.  And they told me the product is no longer available and told me similar product.  It is the same product, but I get 4 instead of 10 for 40 cents less.  I will pass.</li>
    <li> I was looking for regular no Aloe but this is ok</li>
    <li> Ivory Aloe 4-Count Bath Size Bars (4 Oz) arrived as promised,  I used immediately and am very satisfied, will definitely use again.</li>
    <li> IVORY............. The bars are a beauty.  Its a no nonsense bath bar.&lt;br /&gt;It is so smooth and silky on the body.  I bought this for my wife and baby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife liked this so much that she keeps finishing the bars too soon to my surprise.&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, the feel is so smooth and milky, would be the right way to put it.&lt;br /&gt;The aloe fragrance is not pungent and do not irritate anyone.  It is more mild and calm and&lt;br /&gt;soothes our nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that it needs to be kept dry after the bath is done.&lt;br /&gt;It needs to be taken care the bar dish does not have any water in it or the bath bar becomes soggy and wet causing wastage.&lt;br /&gt;It could be because the bar is really soft and if you press the bar hard, one can see their fingerprints on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this has been a very satisfactory purchase.  I will recommend this to friends and family.</li>
    <li> I only use Ivory soap because of skin allergies, so I keep it in my suitcase for traveling and keep another small bar in my purse for hand washing. I like the convenience of having it delivered to my door and the price is the same or better than Walmart. I have been using Ivory for over 50 years, so I guess I can say it works for me.</li>
    <li> Fairly smelly but you might like that.</li>
    <li> Every time I use this product.. I get clean!!</li>
    <li> Other reviewers have described the smell as intense, overwhelming, and overpowering, and I&#x27;m sorry to say I agree -- so much so that I gave the four Aloe bars away as soon as possible and ordered the regular soap instead.  I&#x27;m glad to say the regular Ivory is as good as ever, and I&#x27;d give it five stars.</li>
