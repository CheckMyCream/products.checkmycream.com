<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Very nice razor - good weight, and well made.  Balance is good, but for those of us with larger hands, a longer handle might be nice.  Throw away the Derby blades that come with it - they might be good for scraping paint off a window, but don&#x27;t use them on yourself!</li>
    <li> Today was my first ever experience using a double edge safety razor and it won&#x27;t be my last. After years of shaving with Gillette Fusion 5 blade overpriced razors and blades I am happy to say I have been converted after only one shave with the Edwin Jagger. This isn&#x27;t to say I won&#x27;t try different models or brands of double edge razors in the future, just that I am completely satisfied with the double edge razor design. The Edwin Jagger is beautiful in appearance and well designed for use with a nice weight and adequate size. However, the one complaint I have and the reason I decided to rate it four stars instead of five is the grip, or lack thereof. I worried about this before purchasing but many reviewers said it wasn&#x27;t an issue for them. Unfortunately, I found it a little difficult to hold firmly after rinsing due to the handle getting wet. Prior to my first shave with the EJ, I watched a youtube video to learn the proper technique. It turns out that my shaving technique is pretty close to how the video explained to use a double edge. I went with a 30 degree angle with the grain of my beard for the first pass, and against the grain for the second pass. What I noticed immediately was how sharp the blade is and how little pressure I had to apply. I let the razor&#x27;s weight apply the pressure for the most part and simply guided it along its path. I used the Derby blades that came with the razor and have no complaints. I also purchased a thirty pack of Astra blades, which I will try out after my first blade is ready to be changed. My plan is to have my technique down and then try the Feather blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found another model of Edwin Jagger on Amazon that offers a much nicer knurled handle grip judging from the pictures and reviews. It is the Edwin Jagger Kelvin and is an exclusive design for Amazon.</li>
    <li> Thank you very much, great razor, great shaves</li>
    <li> I started to use this razor in Jan 2015. I wipe it clean after each use and it is in a stand. I noticed about 6 weeks after starting to use it that I was getting a rust colored spot on the side. Not it has a full blown rust spot on it and I will have to replace it soon. For the price it should last a while before it starts to rust.</li>
    <li> Great gift for my dad!</li>
    <li> Wonderful present for a guy! If you use the feather blades it makes it even better! Good quality ! Great gift for a man!</li>
    <li> Good quality, no complaints.</li>
    <li> Solid razor, nice hefty weight.. ...and a 3 piece, so the barrel (handle) can be switched out for a different, compatible piece. For about $31.</li>
    <li> Superb craftsmanship! I went from using disposable razors to this with Derby blades (a small package is included when you buy this), and haven&#x27;t been happier. My face has very sensitive skin, and shaving was a daily headache that meant I&#x27;d have razor burn continually if I wanted to be clean shaven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought it was my face being sensitive, but with this razor and the Derby blades I can shave and not have my face burn for the rest of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, the attention to detail is remarkable on this product. Not a blemish in sight. Also, a note about the handle: If you want the completely smooth handle but worry about it being slippery with wet hands I&#x27;d say if you want the smooth handle buy it and you most likely won&#x27;t notice any slipping while shaving. Even with wet and/or mildly soapy hands this one is pretty easy to hold and given the shallow texture of the handle I wouldn&#x27;t imagine the smooth one would be hard to handle.</li>
    <li> If you are new to using traditional safety razors.....BUY THIS RAZOR. For around $30 you will get a very high quality razor. The chrome is high end and well polished. On cheaper safety razors you can see little waves, not on this one.The razor is surprisingly hefty and requires no pressure against the face while shaving. The weight of the razor head resting against your face is plenty. The quality of this item is superior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to this razor, you should pick the following items:&lt;br /&gt;1. Sample pack of blades. You can get 5-10 different types (100+ blades total) for $20.&lt;br /&gt;2. Proraso pre-shave and shaving soap (green).&lt;br /&gt;3. Badger brush, lather bowl, and stand.&lt;br /&gt;4. Alum bar.</li>
    <li> This product was everything I expected it would be.</li>
    <li> Could be balanced better</li>
    <li> Cuts my beard off, not my face off.  Shiny.  Keep it dry after use and it will last.</li>
    <li> Has a good feel when in your hand and allows quick shaving similar to a disposable once you get the hang of it. Although this DE razor does not have the highest number of reviews on Amazon, it does get praise from purchasers of other brands who had switched. This was reason I purchased it, and having been my first DE, highly satisfied. Regarding other reviews on &amp;#34;breaking&amp;#34;, I do not see how this is possible unless your using excessive force to tighten down the top. It&#x27;s a simple turn until snug type, not a &amp;#34;grip and vise turn&amp;#34; to secure the blade in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have never used a safety razor before purchasing this.  Having said that, I can&#x27;t believe that more people aren&#x27;t using DE razors like this.  The razor is solidly built &amp; I have had no problems disasembling are putting back together after cleanups.  Changing razors is simple &amp; easy.  The chrome razor looks great too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the shave itself.  I have never had a smoother face.  This gets so close I would have passed the old credit-card shave inspections in the Marine Corp.  Seriously, my face hasn&#x27;t been this smooth since I was thirteen.  No skin irritation as well.  It&#x27;s everything I could want in a DE razor &amp; I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this purchase. High quality finish and weight. The shave was very nice; clean, sharp and easy on my skin. Not a single nick or in-grown hair which I&#x27;ve had before with shaves this close. Not going back to my cartridge shave unless I&#x27;m traveling.</li>
    <li> Awesome first DE razor. I added a small 1/16 inch thick rubber washer from local hardware store where handle tightens on screw and it has given me incredible angle blade control. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this because I don&#x27;t shave every day and it didn&#x27;t do well shaving through a few days worth of stubble.  Go with an open comb for that.  If you shave every day a lot of other guys seem to like it.  I gave mine away.  If I would do it again I would have started with a vintage Gillette Tech.</li>
    <li> Great looking, quality 3 pc DE razor. It shaves as good as it looks. I recommend it to anyone wanting to try wet shaving. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
    <li> Well ill start off by saying i upgraded to this from a microtouch one.  I chose this version over the smooth version for added grip in the shower, which it gave. Qualitywise it is a well built, well chromed DE razor. Performance wise ill give it a 4. It feels good in the hand. I have tried the included derby blades as well as my own astra platinums. I do get a closer shave with this but can only make one pass. I dont know if its in regards to me being cheeky/chubby but i feel like i get alot of resistance. It almost feels like im squegeeing my face after first pass. For now ill give it 4 stars due to it being a quality well built piece. Ill give it 5 if i can truly find out wether the razor has  a bad design or is just a user exception.</li>
    <li> I now own two of these.  It is well finished, has a solid build and is a comfortable razor.</li>
    <li> A quality piece. Nice chrome finish. Nice weight. Better than my old gillette from the &#x27;60s.  Sorry fat boy fans</li>
    <li> Love this razor. My first venture into DE shaving and its great. No nicks, easy to handle, convenient to use.</li>
    <li> Nice but SS coating on the head only....still a nice piece, I have since gotten a Webber which is my go to and this is my travel razor. Never use those clogging 2 or 3 blade razors, this is the kind I grew up with but we did not have to disassemble them to put a blade in, a minor inconvenience for the quality and the nice shave. I only shave my neck as I wear a short cropped beard, this is still the way to go......</li>
    <li> My husband says that he loves this razor. He had me feel his face after every use. He likes the weight of it and the look of it.</li>
    <li> Very nice. I LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> I was born in 1946. When I started shaving DE razors were all we had. We did not have YouTube to show us how to use one. Shaving was a daily ritual of nicks, cuts and razor burn. Next came injector razors and we thought we had died and gone to heaven. After that came the double-blade Schick razors and then the three-bladed Mach III.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the Mach III for many years and refused to let the manufacturers gouge me even more by going to the 4 and 5 blade razors. So I went back to a DE safety razor. Initially it was the same old story, nicks and razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;Then I went to YouTube and learned how to properly prepare my beard and use a safety razor. Today I get the smoothest, cleanest shaves possible with no nicks or razor burn. They put the Mach III shaves to shame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I own 11 DE safety razors. This razor has shown itself to be the best. When paired with Astra blades, you can&#x27;t beat it. Astra blades are great. For $34.90 I bought 400 blades from Amazon. You can use a new blade everyday for over a year. It costs more than that to get 16 MACH III blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great razor.The only thing that would make it better is if it had knurling on the handle like the&lt;br /&gt;Merkur 34C instead of vertical grooves. But putting some alum from an alum block on your hand solves the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it, get Astra blades and go to YouTube to learn how to use a DE razor.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll never regret it.</li>
    <li> Nice razor, hefty and well balanced.  Keep threads clean and oiled and it should last a lifetime. I see some had issues with the threads corroding out. Just like a straight razor, maintenance is key.</li>
    <li> I decided to make the switch from traditional cartridge to a double edge safety razor.  After reading many reviews, I decided on the Edwin Jagger DE89.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor has great weight and is extremely easy to handle.  Many people said there is a learning curve associated with the switch but I found that curve to be quite easy to handle.  Within a handful of shaves, I was extremely comfortable with the razor and felt it gave a great shave. The razor is very rugged and the blade is super easy to change. My only suggestion would be to buy a case for the razor.  Overall, it is the perfect fit for me and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the performance and ease of use.</li>
    <li> Love this razor. DE shaving for me from now on</li>
    <li> Awesome product, I switched from the Fusion and will never go back. I&#x27;m highly recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> Fabulous Razor. Gives the perfect shaving angle and performs flawlessly.</li>
    <li> This is my first DE razor. I always used mach3 razors and they only lasted me 3-4 shaves and it was just to expensive. i found myself not shaving because i was afraid of the pull the mach series gave me, so I decided to switch. i waited 2 days to shave to test it out and was disappointed when it come with no blades like it stated. so after getting some derby ones i lathered up with the van der hagen set ( highly recommend ) and stared my shave. this was my first time using the de style razor and yes there will be blood lots of it your first time. with that being said i found it to be the most easy going shave with virtually no tugs. even though i cut myself many times i love this razor i just need more practice. i would have given 5 stars but i didnt get the blades with it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my only razor I have and use every other day for almost two years. I recommend it to anyone</li>
    <li> Beautiful raiser! I had never used a safety raiser before but this one is great. Good price and i think it seems a better quality than some more recognized brand.</li>
    <li> I order this to shave the hair off my face. Beard and all. Once I was done I looked at myself in the mirror looked like a completely different person! This product gets 5 starts because it was wrapped nice and did wonders to my face. Although, personally, I prefer my hairies. So I will store this hair slicing machine away and let it grow.</li>
    <li> It is difficult to assess the relative effectiveness of this double edge razor compared to other razor holders considering I havent tried other razor holders, but I do like it</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd DE razor after a cheapo one I bought at some beauty supply shop. It is very well constructed and looks very nice. Compared to the cheap razor I bought first, this one is not very aggressive at all but still cuts nice and close.</li>
    <li> Gents, this is the best shave I can imagine. I watched an YouTube video on this product and decided to try it. I&#x27;m impressed and never going back to cartridges. I shared the product review with my military brethren, and they&#x27;re just as happy as I am. No more bumps. No more ingrown hairs. All is well after about t weeks. I wish I&#x27;d have done this years ago.</li>
    <li> Excellent.  My boyfriend loves this shaver.  A great buy.</li>
    <li> this product was great all around however I would have you note that it doesn&#x27;t open from on top but rather you have to stick in the blade by unscrewing it which makes it more difficult than the one I was used to however its the difference of a few seconds and not really important.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor that quickly pays for itself.  The shave is incredibly smooth and a single razor lasts for a month or more of (almost) daily shaving.  Even the nicer plastic disposables just don&#x27;t hold up to it.  I&#x27;ll never go back.  This is the second I&#x27;ve owned (I lost my first at a HoJo&#x27;s...).  The only advice I would give is not to rest the razor on it&#x27;s side--put it in a cup so the blade doesn&#x27;t sit in water.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Much better than those macho razors</li>
    <li> Very well made safety razor..I have very sensitive skin and Im not a every day shaver..But still got tired of paying lots of cash for throw-aways...The 5 Derby blades are also a very nice bonus...Along with the Gillette sensitive shaving cream...Very nice and cut free shave...I can&#x27;t understand why safety razors are not sold in stores...But I hear that they are coming back...You don&#x27;t even have to press down on your face......Really nice for us fair skinned guys...Derby  blades are just great...Bought a 25 count from Amazon...Should last 6 months....The very best shave cream for me is Fusion proglide hydra.....But make sure you get the one with ( Shea) Butter...Read the label! Must have Shea Butter.....Forget the one I mentioned earlier...Gillette sensitive.......</li>
    <li> I would recommend this razor too anybody needing a razor to get a close enough shave soo close its like being shaved with a straight razor afterwards also very detailed and shiny too</li>
    <li> I have been using this for three months now and I have nothing to complain about. The build quality and chrome finish are excellent. I am glad I bought the Lined handle instead of the smooth chrome, the extra grip makes me more comfortable. Since I&#x27;ve never used any other DE razors, I have nothing else to compare it to. I&#x27;m sure there are some even better razors out there but this one is a great quality at a reasonable price. I didn&#x27;t give it five stars because this razor is still rather new and I have not tested other DE razors. So far so good though!</li>
    <li> I am not sure why I brought it now. But I am not using it now. I used it few times till I used all the blades came with it.  I went back to my disposables. The make is good. Feel heavy in your hand which is a good thing. I just don&#x27;t like it personally. The quality of the razor itself is good.</li>
    <li> I was using my fathers old Gillette army razor which cut ok but I needed something more sharp. So I decided to give this razor a chance. What a difference this razor cuts like butter. I didn&#x27;t have any trouble cutting my beard without much effort. Mind you I have experience using safety years so I know how to apply the right amount of pressure. I love this razor and enjoy it very much. I am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> In a world with vibrating razors with blades that cost more than your lunch, it&#x27;s nice to know that the old, reliable, double-edge safety razor remains available.  At about 7 cents a blade, you won&#x27;t wince when it&#x27;s time for a new blade.  And if you are reasonably careful, you won&#x27;t wince from nicking yourself while shaving.  Combine this nicely-made razor, a sharp blade and some Palmolive tube shave cream and welcome back to the future (of shaving).  Of course, if you are a real fan of shaving, this Edwin Jagger never will replace your Solingen-made straight razor and a badger brush full of creamy shaving soap.  But then again, you don&#x27;t have to be quite as careful or sharpen the blade on a regular basis.  If the old-time ways of the future (circa 1947) catch your fancy, you will be quite pleased with this Edwin Jagger razor.  And if you are even looking at these razors, it is because deep down inside, you want one.</li>
    <li> Good build quality, not as good as my feather all stainless, but much cheaper.  Too aggressive to go against the grain on my neck, so I use my feather for that.</li>
    <li> length is to small for my hand</li>
    <li> Exceptional value. Excellent build quality. There are better razors out there, but not anywhere near this price.</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to and does it well.</li>
    <li> Love the little lips on the underside to help flush out hair.</li>
    <li> I started shaving the good old fashioned way with a double edged safety razor around six months ago.  My first razor was a Merkur Progress (adjustable).  While the Merkur did a good job, this Edwin Jagger DE89 is SUPER SMOOTH!  It&#x27;s like you don&#x27;t even feel it slicing through hairs at all, and, it&#x27;s got a great angle to it when you shave properly.  I am African American and suffer from razor bumps.  Now I have no more bumps.  One important note is to only shave with the grain of your hair.  Shaving against or sometimes even across the hair grain causes the hair to grow back into your skin, thus causing those unsightly bumps.  I use this with [[ASIN:B001E6QUNK The Art of Shaving Shaving Cream Lavender for Sensitive Skin]],[[ASIN:B000JKVOSS The Art of Shaving Pre-Shave Oil Lavender 2 oz.]].  To close my pores immediately after shaving, I use [[ASIN:B000PP15L8 Thayer - Witch Hazel Toner Alcohol Free Lavender, 12 fl oz liquid]] and then use [[ASIN:B00162M78E The Art Of Shaving After Shave Balm Lavender [3.4]]] for aftershave.  One more thing, I use [[ASIN:B001QY8QXM 100 Astra Superior Premium Platinum Double Edge Razor Blades]] for a smooth, clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a BIG favor and pick this razor up.  I know it seems like a whole lot of work to shave but we men have gotten lazy because this is how our grandfathers used to shave and there is a darn good reason for it.  You never caught your grandfather with shaving bumps, did you???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just note that once you train yourself properly on double edged shaving technique, you may want to graduate to an adjustable razor such as the Merkur Progress, Merkur Vision, Merkur Futur, or any other vintage/non-vintage adjustable razor.</li>
    <li> This is a high quality razor. I recently returned to \\&quot;wet shaving,\\&quot; a luxury if you have the time to properly prepare your whiskers. The reviews about this razor were spot on: a balanced weight (important for a good shave and control) and well-crafted. This design requires removing the head (the razor&#x27;s, not yours) to install the blade, as opposed to a \\&quot;butterfly\\&quot; head that opens by twisting the razor&#x27;s handle.    I have since found a couple of vintage razors at the local flea market that I cleaned and oiled and prefer. If, however, you want a brand new razor, spend the money for one of this quality. After all, it&#x27;s your face, and this one will last like an heirloom. It comes with five Derby blades, a fine complement to this particular razor. Good shave!</li>
    <li> Well, I was skeptical that an old-time razor would be something that would be so much better than the newest technology of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well a whole package to do it right and all for under a $100.00 to start with everything.  But pry right around [...] a month to shave after this month.  I do not like to tout particular products unless I have used them, believe they are better than average and I believe my best friend would thank me for telling them.  Pretty strong words, but I pride myself on not beating around the bush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several I believe are of benefit;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edwin Jagger De89lbl Double Edge Safety Razor-Lined&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002RBF1PO/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rev_prod_img&lt;br /&gt;(They have one of the worst websites for anything more than basic company history but there razor is of the utmost premium quality)you will be glad you left electric with is overpriced then discontinued cutter blades and the super expensive 4-5 blade somewhat disposables that cost a mint and tear your face off each day.

    <li> This is a very nice blade in chrome to display and to use as well. The Personna double edge blades definetly work better on this product.</li>
    <li> I, like many others, was sick of the cost of replacement blades on the 10 bladed (are they to that point YET?) store brand razors and was looking for an alternative.      I remember \\&quot;shaving\\&quot; with this type when I was a little kid with my father (less the blade of course) and brought back fond memories.  Just was not sure how good of a shave I would get.    My father said they didn&#x27;t work all that good for him as his whiskers are very fine and he said he just never got that good of a shave but is also sick of the replacement blade cost.  Not sure if his problem was the quality of razor or not but my beard is not as fine but is rather so compared to others.      I have been using this now for 3 weeks and I have not noticed any better or worse performance (close shave from all) but do find shaving more enjoyable lathering up with a brush and going at it.    I also thought I would have to take more time from some of the reviews but I really don&#x27;t see it taking any longer than with the gillette I have.      What I am really pleased with is that replacement blades will no longer cost me $60 at costco, saving me tons of money and the feeling of being raped by Gillette and Schick for whatever ridiculous # bladed product they force down your throat.</li>
    <li> I dropped the razor on a tile floor and the head broke off at the screw assembly.  It can&#x27;t be repaired.  Cheap metal screw.</li>
    <li> part that screws in broke. cheap material.</li>
    <li> For the price, this is clearly the best made and best looking, period. The Merkur 34c is too short and the chrome is not as good. The workmanship are close. The Parker 99r and 98r have deep chrome but with spots and the fit are more loose than the Brits and German. But with the extra weight and length they are my favorites.</li>
    <li> Glad I made the switch!</li>
    <li> I ordered Edwin Jagger De89lbl  because my son was using my long handle Merkur razor which was my favorite at the time, and some the reviews said the finish was better. I agree. At first it took getting used to. The handle being shorter and a little slipper as one reviewer stated. I would of like it if the handle was a little longer with a different finish. I have a lots of different razors. I still like to use this one every day. The plating on this razor blows the other away.The shave I get is as close as can be. If you are looking for a beautiful razor and a great shave this razor stands by itself from the rest of the pack.</li>
    <li> Shaves nicely, but chrome finish has started to chip off about a year later.  It shaves nicely, but am disappointed with the finish.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy the aesthetics of this DE razor and it works well for me. This is my first DE razor and did quite a bit of research on Amazon before deciding on this one. In hindsight I may have chosen the Merkur long handled model but I do like the weight and feel of this razor, so I don&#x27;t regret this purchase. At some point in the future I may try the Merkur- if I do, I&#x27;ll revise this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other items I purchased for my initial DE kit, which I&#x27;m THRILLED with are:&lt;br /&gt;Perfecto Badger Brush&lt;br /&gt;Pefector Chrome Razor Stand&lt;br /&gt;Double Edge Safety Razor Blade Variety Pack - 100 Blades!&lt;br /&gt;Taconic Shave Barbershop Quality Lime Shaving Soap with Antioxidant-Rich Hemp Seed Oil</li>
    <li> Great built razor, nice chroming and weight. A little shorter than I&#x27;m used to (coming from a cartridge razor), but great quality nonetheless.</li>
    <li> A very solid, well crafted razor. I do agree with some others about the ability to grasp the razor when your hand is wet, but you adjust. This is my first double edge razor and the craftsmanship is superb, nicely chromed and beautiful to the eye. This is a great first razor and I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase. I recommend this for those just starting wet shaving, you&#x27;ll be hard pressed to find a better razor with such quality. As always, Amazon is great to do business with.</li>
    <li> I purchased my Jagger De89lbl nearly a year ago and it is the razor I use every day. I also have a vintage Gillette Slim Adjustable, but the Jagger is my favorite.  What Makes this Razor so Great?  Aside from the beautiful finish and great value, the head is made by the well-known German razor company Muhle. The Jagger sells for about half the price of the equivalent Muhle razor [[ASIN:B0047ACVUQ Muhle Closed Comb Double Edge Safety Razor, R89, Chrome Plated Metal]] with the same head. Hands down, the Muhle head is one of the best shaving heads designed, IMHO. It provides an excellent balance between aggressiveness, ease of use and smoothness.  I Look Forward to Shaving  I never thought shaving could be so enjoyable until I started using a quality DE razor. It takes a little longer to shave with one, but during the work week I use one of the foamless shaving creams-- Neutrogena [[ASIN:B00596VEP0 Neutrogena Men Skin Clearing Shave Cream, 5.1 Ounce (Pack of 2)]] and Burt&#x27;s Bees [[ASIN:B002VWL2GG Men&#x27;s Shave Cream - 6 oz - Cream]] are two that I&#x27;m aware of. These don&#x27;t require a brush and lube my face as well as, or better than the high-end shaving soaps. On the weekend when I have more time I get out the brush to foam up.  Cons:  I would prefer a better grip on the razor, but this is minor. You just need to keep your hand free of soap or cream to maintain a solid grip. This has not been a problem for me.</li>
    <li> Received this DE razor in the mail earlier this week and had my first shave with it after PT this morning. All I can say is \\&quot;wow!\\&quot; Excellent construction and precision manufacturing are evident in this British made product. Classic design with no bells or whistles; just an all around solid razor that will perform consistently and last decades.  The Derby&#x27;s that come with it are decent. They perform just fine for my thin facial hair, but someone with a thicker beard might want to upgrade to Feathers.  Only con imo, is that the handle of the razor is a little too smooth and is fairly slippery when wet. I might take a couple passes with 2000 grit sandpaper over the handle.</li>
    <li> So this is my first ever Amazon review.  I feel so strongly about this product that I have chosen to delve in to the world of Amazon.com reviewing!  First, a little back story.  I&#x27;ve been a wet shaver for about 5 years.  Right out of high school I had a beard to make a lumberjack envious.  I had been shaving already for years, and had spent who knows how much money on cartridges and electric razors and shaving cream (the canned variety)  etc...  After starting college and being \\&quot;out on my own\\&quot; and needing to budget, I quickly saw that shaving was turning into a great hassle!  A buddy of mine read an article online about wet shaving in general, and about straight shaving in particular.  He was not up for the whole \\&quot;cut throat\\&quot; razor thing, but me being the more adventurous one thought that sounded awesome!  So, for Christmas that year, I requested razor equipment from everyone who could conceivably get me a gift, and through that had a nice complete straight razor  set.  After much trial and error, and a few scars now, I pretty much mastered the art of straight razor shaving.    There is one thing that I could not and can not master, the art of sharpening those razors!  I have a nice set of water stones, but no matter how much I practice, or  how many video tutorials I watch I can not get my razors as sharp as they need to be.  So, now comes the double edge razor.  I had been looking for a vintage razor, because I dig that kind of stuff, but was just not happy about any ones on \\&quot;the bay\\&quot;.  So I came to Amazon and thought I&#x27;d check out what they had here.  First off, we all know how hard it is for any item to have a full five star rating on Amazon, but  that is what this razor had!  And for around $35, who could not try it out?  So I jumped in and ordered this razor last week.   I received it and was blown away by the craftsmanship.  Everyone agrees how well made this razor is, and I am no exception.  This thing is awesome!  It looks great, it feels great, and it works great too.  As I said before, I have a very thick beard, so for me shaving is an everyday occurrence.  I first took a shower to get my beard nice and soft and clean, then lathered up  with my favorite badger hair brush, and gave my face a good coating of lather.  I always start with the grain of my hair.  This was a little tricky, because I am so used to  the straight razor cutting exactly where I see the blade touch.  So there is a bit of a learning curve on that.  But it shaved through my beard like butter!  I next did an across the grain pass, and this was much easier to see where the razor was cutting.  Lastly, was the against the grain pass.  I was a little leery of this because I was never able to do this with regular cartridge razors because it would tear up my face, leaving  razor burn, in grown hairs, and general discomfort.  This little puppy popped those hairs off with hardly any feeling!  Afterward I rinsed with cold water, applied some after-shave lotion  and voila, wet shaving perfection!  I have read some reviews saying that this razor&#x27;s handle is too small.  I can&#x27;t see how that is possible.  I have huge hands and I have no problem using this razor.  For those who say that this razor slides when you grip it, wtf?  This has not slipped once since I&#x27;ve been shaving, and I use anything but a vice-like grip.    Just nice and gentle does the trick, and it has never slipped.  How about the reviews about the weight being in the handle and not the head and having to push too hard?  Also poppycock (always wanted to use that word).   Sure most of the weight is in the handle, but the head of this razor is still perfectly acceptable to get a great shave, and it&#x27;s only $35!  So, in closing, after re-reading this novel I just wrote, this is a fantastic razor.  It comes with 5 Derby blades, and you get two sides to each of those blades, so you are well supplied  with razors for a while.  I would recommend this item to anyone who is looking for a great, comfortable shave.  And not just the men, my wife used this to shave her legs last night, and man!  She agreed that they have never been so smooth!  So good luck to all of you future wet shavers, I hope you all have many years of enjoyment from this little investment.</li>
    <li> The Edwin Jagger DE89L is a superb DE safety razor.  I have four other DE safety razors to compare it with including a \\&quot;Mergress.\\&quot;  This Edwin Jagger is probably the best performing of them all.  The head is well engineered and manufactured with a fairly mild blade gap.  It gives an extremely smooth shave.  I have not cut or nicked myself with it.  The finish of the razor is second to none.  The only negatives are the handle grip is not well textured, and the whole razor is somewhat light weight.</li>
    <li> Superior quality and craftsmanship, definitely a close shave ,best razor I ever bought,  no more razor burn or in grown hair&#x27;s .</li>
    <li> This was my first double edge safety razor. I&#x27;d read about the benefits of a wet shave, so when I saw this razor was on sale, I jumped on the purchase. I&#x27;m prone to lots of ingrown hairs on my neck as the hair tends to grow sideways in that area. I usually use a Braun electric razor but that razor often misses hairs or tends to just pull them out. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, that Braun razor is OK for what it is, but it&#x27;s not going to produce as close or as clean of a shave as a blade razor. I&#x27;ve tried using multiple blade cartridges, they really just get too close, which causes my hairs to recess into the skin, causing ugly and painful ingrown hairs. I&#x27;ve tried cheap disposable razors and while they&#x27;re better for my sensitive skin than a multi blade super razor, they also create a few ingrown hairs. After receiving this razor I have not yet had an ingrown hair on my neck, it&#x27;s incredible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So there you have it, I&#x27;m impressed with this razor and highly recommend it to anyone looking to achieve a closer shave with minimal irritation. There&#x27;s loads of resources out there on the web, reddit, youtube, that will guide you on how to use these razors.</li>
    <li> Background&lt;br /&gt;The Marketing Machine Behind Modern Razors:&lt;br /&gt;Okay so I have read a few articles about how companies like Gillette mark up the price of razor cartridges by 4750%  Google the following articles \\&quot;Great razor rip-off: Gillette&#x27;s 4,750% mark-up\\&quot; and \\&quot;Do You Owe Your Crappy Shave To Patents?\\&quot;  I was under the spell of the Gillette MARKETING MACHINE and paid WAY too much for my replacement cartridges because I have a thick beard and sensitive skin.  I was worried about switching to a DE razor because I had been brain washed for so many years that the only way to get a good shave was to take out a second mortgage on my house. I had also shaved with lower end razors and was never impressed with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I discovered the Edwin Jagger (clouds part...insert sun):&lt;br /&gt;I can honestly say that the Edwin Jagger is the best razor I have ever shaved with.  I have always wet shaved in the shower so I thought I would take the extra step and try this product.  I relied on the other reviews here and also thought that it was a relatively inexpensive investment compared to what I currently paid for just cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;The razor itself is a work of art.  It also protects the blade well enough to provide an extremely close shave without hacking your face off.  The learning curve is zero.  I have only shaved 3 times with it, because I have only had it 3 days (no cuts).&lt;br /&gt;AND THE REPLACEMENT BLADES ARE ONLY 7 CENTS EACH. Not $3-$4 bucks.&lt;br /&gt;This is truly a no brainer if you ask me.  Buy one and see for yourself.</li>
    <li> This is a good raszor,But its handle is too short.&lt;br /&gt;and you have unscrew it to load the blade&lt;br /&gt;the butterfly are the ones i like but i thought&lt;br /&gt;i would give it a try? its not for me!</li>
    <li> Well this is my second safety razor and I did not expect much of a difference from my last one. I am not hyping this up in saying this thing blows it out of the water! I was used to my featherlight and also a little disappointed with the safety razor shave it gave. However, the Jagger really does give you that smooth irritation free shave I always heard about. My only dissapointment with this razor is the fact the handle is a lot shorter than what I am used to. I was able to get a nice shave with no cuts, but it will take some time adjusting to the handle.  The handle length is the only reason I give this bad boy a 4 star rating.</li>
    <li> I expected much more from this razor after reading all the great reviews. It looks OK, the weight is a little light and it is somewhat slippery in the hand, more so than other razors I have.  It is a very mild shave and I can&#x27;t imagine this cutting your face up unless you are into drunk shaving or something. I was hoping for a much closer shave. I have to do way too many passes to get close and end up with razor burn.  I have tried feather and persona blades with this.  I probably won&#x27;t be using this again.</li>
    <li> Very nice quality Razor for the price long handle very comparable to a Merkur 34c</li>
    <li> This is my first DE razor and will probably be the only one that I buy. While my best shave has always been first thing in the morning, I couldn&#x27;t wait to try this razor the day it was delivered. I used Kiss My Face shave creme and a Plisson badger brush that I have had for about 20 years. I shaved with short strokes, rinsing frequently. I am amazed that I could barely feel the razor blade against my skin. I applied no pressure at all to my face. I let the weight of the razor head do the work. This razor performed beautifully. Using the included Derby blade, I never cut myself. Not once. My face was smooth and had no irritation at all.  As for the quality and workmanship of this razor, it is first rate. Perfect chrome. I disassemble the razor after each use and hand dry all three parts, plus the blade. I imagine this razor lasting as long as I want it to last. It really is hard to imagine that the best can be had for $35.00. The grooved detail on the handle does help considerably with gripping the razor lightly. On a couple of occasions, I have towel dried the handle of the razor as I wasn&#x27;t really confident in my grip while it was wet. That said, my hand never did slip. I can see why some might find the handle to be a bit short, and that was my initial impression. But it you hold the razor properly towards the head with a light grip, the butt end of the grip settles into the palm of your hand. This length then becomes ideal.  I hope this was helpful.  Update My thoughts of only buying one razor were wrong. This one shaves as good or better than the others, so I ended up with a collection, not an upgrade. I am now using Taylor of Old Bond Street lavender shave cream and Shave Secret as a pre-shave oil. The results are outstanding. I now get a nice clean shave every shave with no razor burn. Better than I imagined.  As others have undoubtedly learned, shaving is a process that can&#x27;t be rushed.  Please take the time to develop a good pre-shave routine and don&#x27;t be afraid to experiment with different blades to find one that works best for you.  While many shave forums are frequented by those obsessed with the closest shave possible, use videos on shaving to get more accurate and more practical advice.  Avoid making extra passes and avoid the 3-pass shave.  It is well advised to only shave with-the-grain and cross grain.  Never shave against the grain. It causes ingrown hairs, increases irritation, and increases the likelihood of infection.  And remember one more thing: make not shaving part of your shaving routine.  If possible, skip a day.  This will allow your face to heal a bit and allow any irritation to quiet down.  It also improves the skin for the next round of shaving.  Enjoy your shave.  Please let me know if this helps.  Thanks</li>
    <li> This is a great razor for the price.</li>
    <li> The finish on this razor is beautiful.  I&#x27;ve had mine for almost 3 years now and it looks good as new.  All I do is rub a little Dr. Bronner&#x27;s on it every once in a while.  I especially like the weight and balance of this razor.  It&#x27;s got heft, and the handle is not too long.  It&#x27;s really a beautiful piece.  I get the best shaves I&#x27;ve ever had with this razor.  If you&#x27;re new to DE shaving: there is a small learning curve, but now I can&#x27;t remember the last time I cut myself.  Use the Derby blades you get with this razor to hone your technique and then get a sampler or order a handful of different blades to try.  I urge everyone to switch to a safety razor because: 1. It&#x27;s cheaper  2. you&#x27;ll get a better shave  3. It&#x27;s environmentally friendly</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son and he loves it.  He has big hands and he says the handle is long enough and not slippery (I bought the one with the lines going trough the handle, not sure what you would call that).  The Chrome is nice and the product was of a very good quality.  I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Had mine for well over a year now and love it.  Sturdy construction and keeps the blade at just the right angle.  Excellent build quality and overall look and feel.</li>
    <li> My first DE razor was a Merkur Futur. I bought it about 6 months ago. The times I got a good shave were just a few. Yesterday I tested this EJ DE razor and I was amazed on how easy it was to shve myself. I almost didn&#x27;t feel like the razor was cutting. Buy it!&lt;br /&gt;I bought the expensive Merkur thinking that by buying a top-of-the-line razor from the begining was going to be better, but now I see I was wrong.</li>
    <li> I bought one, and when it got dropped down a stairwell and broke, I liked it enough I simply bought another without any shopping around.</li>
    <li> Good weight. It does take a bit of work to keep it clean.</li>
    <li> As with some of the others who have commented, I too started wet-shaving with a DE about two months ago.  The heavily marketed Merkur 33C came out tops and I bought one.  Imagine my dismay when I found out how small it was.  It shaved ok - but nicked me several times (once taking a patch of skin off).  Thanks to other reviewers here, I bought one of these Jaggers and had my first shave with it this morning using one of the Derby blades provided - I now have firsthand experience with what a good shave means!  No nicks - 3 passes in the same direction - and it gave me an extremely close shave without burn or nicks.  I put the Merkur back in its box - and it will probably stay there until the next yard sale (I have German neighbors who will no doubt enjoy it - haha).  PLEASE - if you are new to \\&quot;wet shaving\\&quot; try these first - the couple of extra dollars you spend will be so worth it.</li>
    <li> My first DE razor, and so far i&#x27;m satisfied. I found the derby blades that came with it to be consistent and they cut very well. I appreciate the chrome plating and always shine it back up after each use. The weight is also perfect. I wouldn&#x27;t change a thing.</li>
    <li> After going into shock in the replacement blade area in the grocery store based on the cost (triples were 27$ for 5 - C&#x27;MON!), I found a deal on disposables. Cheap as could be when they were in. I needed to end this cycle of misplaced frugality!!! Enter a double edge razor. The DE89 came on my radar and I was swayed by the reviews and comparisons - once the reading/research was done, time to &amp;#34;man up&amp;#34;!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had this for about 3 weeks and really love it. On the personal side - I LOVE TOOLS and have a butt load in my shop to prove it. This was a tool, a well-made tool, for cutting stubble off my big ol&#x27; face. Wonderful fit and finish, shiny and chrome, like the dashboard on a 1958 Pontiac station wagon. The handle was perfect and is a breeze to hang on to; I have bigger hands and like the size, balance and proportion of the razor. One appealing point, I like the fact that it is more dangerous than a plastic razor. You can slap those around like a fool and go as fast as you want without a nick - I have shaved with both hands, using 2 plastics in 4 seconds once. Why, I dunno... To the point, this is really well built, simple, high quality razor - a fine piece of English metal work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shift from the cheap junk to this had me relearning shaving. Again, it&#x27;s a new tool I had to learn how it cuts, the method, the nuances. You will have to develop your technique, like maybe the difference from a paring chisel to a mortising chisel. I got the Taylor of Old Bond St. cream with the Escali brush - call it a shave! I think my testosterone has shot up since I am using a tool to shave and the great scent of the shave cream has the blessing of my chick. No further discussion there, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In closing; I have ordered a sample pack of blades to see what works best and will report back. Derby blades came with mine and I get three or four days out of those. My beard is pretty heavy and my skin is on the dry side, so blade trials will reveal awinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chuck the cartridge crap and throw out the disposables. Man up and order an Edwin Jagger DE89L and treat yourself to a manly shave. Learn the new techniques and turn your shaving task into a manly pleasure, after I am done, I look in the mirror and think “Ready to face the day, where is my Claymore and shield?!” I even love telling folks “I use a DE89L to shave”. Hell, it sounds cool.</li>
    <li> Gave this as a gift and they loved it! I continue to convert people from the abyss of over-priced disposable cartridges, that tug and pull.  With the upswing and renewed interest in double-edged razors, there are more and better options than ever before.  I believe for the price, very few models can come close to Edwin Jagger DE89 models.  Nice weight, easy to use, easy to clean, and no tugging or pulling.  As far as razor blades, that is a personal preference, but with a nice de razor, good blades, and good cream, you will get a better shave and most likely save a good chunk of money for the year.  There&#x27;s no reason to stay with disposable cartridges.</li>
    <li> Great balance, not too aggressive, and the quality of the chrome plating is amazing.  Love this razor so far.</li>
    <li> At 84, I was having trouble getting a close shave with the throw away razors.  When an ex-Marine friend asked if I forgot to put a blade in my razor that morning, I went looking for a real double edge razor and the reviews led me to this one.  Thanks to the folks who did extensive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is 5 star all the way.  It is a fine instrument - heavy but well balanced and delivers a very comfortable smooth shave.  I should have had this years ago.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product. It could be an excellent gift for a brother, father, etc.</li>
    <li> Just the best I have found.  Does a great job.  Well made and great to use.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor. Amazing quality,nice balance,gorgous chrome finish.  Used with CO Bigelow(porasso)shaving cream and have I get fantastic close shaves.  If you been thinking of getting a DE, get this one, you will be pleased.</li>
    <li> I have used every type of disposable razor on the market from the cheap twin blades to the more expensive 3 &amp; 5 blade systems with vibrating handles and LED lights. Until now, I have never used a double edge safety razor but I can say with complete confidence that I will NEVER go back to the disposables. The Derby blades that came with the razor cut through hair with less effort than any disposable and are far less expensive. The chrome razor itself is absolutely gorgeous and has some weight to it so it feels nice in your hand. Shockingly, I have only experienced the most minor abrasions and have cut myself much worse with the disposables.  It seems like the gap between the blade &amp; razor is ideal so that you get an excellent cutting angle when the blade touches your face but with minimal risk of abrasion, at least for my face.  My only complaint about the razor is that it felt a little slippery in my hands when I first started using it.  I am now more comfortable with the razor and worry a lot less about it slipping from my hand.</li>
    <li> This is an ok razor. It has a nice weight and feel to it, although I would prefer it a bit heavier and longer. It&#x27;s short even for my medium-sized hands. It looks fine, a bit plain. The guards are perfect. The blades end up evenly-spaced, and are easily drawn across the face at the correct angle. The twist function to replace the blade works ok, but it is a bit of a process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, it&#x27;s priced a bit higher than &amp;#34;decent quality,&amp;#34; and therein lies the problem. The first time I used it, I noticed a chip in the chrome on the side of the head. I didn&#x27;t bang the razor on anything, so I&#x27;m guessing it was there when I received the item. It hasn&#x27;t gotten noticeably worse in the past month, but it&#x27;s annoying that I know it&#x27;s there, that it may get worse, and that it could continue to flake off down the road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t recommend this product at this price. There are less expensive razors that are perfectly functional. When you add quibbles about the handle, the humdrum looks, the chipped chrome, the fact that some may prefer butterfly functionality to replace razors, the length and weight preferences, this razor just doesn&#x27;t quite do it for me. If I could do it all over again, I&#x27;d get something either cheaper and functional or more expensive and higher quality.</li>
    <li> One of the best de razor&#x27;s i have owned !  and my favorite blades are&lt;br /&gt;Personna Double Edge Razor Blades, 100 Count.</li>
    <li> I just received my Edwin Jagger De89lbl. I had to try it out before taking a spin on my motorcycle to pay some bills. I whipped up some lather with Williams Mug Soap and prep the ole face. I used my Pure Badger brush  and the rest is history. I did a 3 pass shave and let me tell you, this razor is awesome. The balance, style and construction makes you want to shave all day. I had very few nicks due to I did not lube the face with my Art Of Shaving oil and also getting the hang of a heavier razor. Next time. I have not had a shave this close before. My skin feels so silky smooth and soft. I just ordered a Parker 22R Butterfly razor to add to my Art Of Shaving collection. I ordered a container of Taylor On Bond Street shaving cream and 3 different scented bars of Col. Conk soap. I used a DE razor back in the early 80s and then went with a electric shaver. Then I started using the Mach 3 and can foam. Not the same folks. Not the same. I am really enjoying the art of shaving and can&#x27;t wait for my next one. Tomorrow. Amazon delivered one day ahead of time, but the Post Office did not put my package in my P.O. Box the same day. So I waited for the exact date as promised which was today. I have nothing but great words for Amazon because I have bought videos, cameras and video equipment from them also.</li>
    <li> Great starter razor, Not to aggressive</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned numerous DE (Double Edge) razors including vintage Gillettes and the Merkur 33HD.   Some wet shavers enjoy having numerous razors in their rotation, but I really just wanted to find one great razor.  I found it in the EJ.  The EJ shaves much smoother than the Merkur, and shaved better than just about any vintage Gillette I owned.   I decided to sell the only razor than came close, a Gillette Rocket HD, because it was a $75.00 razor that I happened to pick up for $10.00.      I highly recommend this razor to beginners and experienced wet shavers.  The finish is amazing, and much nicer than the Merkur.  The only concern was the handle, but so long as there is no soap on you hand or the handle, the grip is fine.   Great razor!</li>
    <li> Heavy Duty and Shining Quality</li>
    <li> Is the blade exposure even with razor? I have the Utopia Care razor and I like it, but the blade floats in the head and I want to upgrade.</li>
    <li> this razor is magnificent</li>
    <li> The quality of this razor exceeded my expectation. It is solid and has a good weight to it. The shave I receive is very close and yet comfortable.  I like the solid feel it has when locking down the blade. It will last me a long time. It cleans up well and shines like new with a small amount of effort.</li>
    <li> Great razor, well balanced.</li>
    <li> I like the razor and all, but the one problem I&#x27;ve just encountered over only a couple months use is the &amp;#34;chroming&amp;#34; is coming off.  I just feel let down by this because otherwise I find it to be well designed.</li>
    <li> The razor fell off my sink and the head broke off from the handle.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor as a gift, but I was told that it performs greatly.  The delivery was quick and the razor arrived in great condition.</li>
    <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Very Sleek&lt;br /&gt;- Holds blades perfect&lt;br /&gt;- Sits in stands perfect&lt;br /&gt;- Very comfortable size&lt;br /&gt;- Wasn&#x27;t hard to use for a beginner&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- MADE OF VERY CHEAP POT METAL BROKE ON THE FIRST DROP</li>
    <li> I cut my thumb pretty bad trying to unscrew the handle to remove the blade. You have to hold onto the head, which puts your fingers sauerk dangerously close to the blade while you unscrew it. Im going to switch to one of those razors with butterfly doors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, is been great. Good shave. I&#x27;m a beginner, and the razor is very forgiving when i don&#x27;t have the angle just right.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item thinking I was going to be wowed because of the reviews.  Not so much.  I was impressed by the closeness of the shave, but found the shave lasted a very short while.  To be fair, I must say I have a thick beard that grows rapidly...someone that has always had to shave twice a day. However, I find the Gillette Fusion shave last longer on me...which means it much cut the hair deeper.  I used two different types of razors: Derby (the one that came with it) and the Feather razor.  Derby  seem to cut closer, with more nicks.  It may be the design of the razor (this is my first safety razor).  There is a reason this type of razor is not as popular:  the updated razors work better.</li>
    <li> Beautifully crafted high gloss chrome in the finest detail. I like the three piece design and the weight  Great shave every time.</li>
    <li> The EJ DE89 is a great razor but I find the lined handle is slippery and hard to hold with wet hands. It even slipped out of my hands once and fell in the wash basin but luckly was not damaged. I remembered seeing a shaving video about rubbing wet fingers on an alum block to keep your fingers from slipping from your wet skin when shaving your face or neck. I use the alum block now on my fingers while holding the razor and solved the problem. This Jagger DE 89 was my first de razor I purchased when I got off the cartridge blades. This razor and the Merkur 34 hd are similar and seem to be very popular. I later purchased several other razors  including the Merkur 34 hd. Even though the EJ 89 is a great razor I prefer the Mekur 34. For me the Merkur 34 has a more comfortable feel and is easier to keep the right shaving angle. I rotate all my razors but find myself grabbing the Merkur 34 more often than the EJ 89.</li>
    <li> What a great razor!  I can tell after a few shaves that this is the last razor I will buy.  The quality is great and the shave is close.</li>
    <li> A very well made product, but... the handle is on the short side, and I&#x27;ve found the polished finish (which looks great) is not so practical after all (gets quite slippery when shaving).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for nearly a year now. All is well. It&#x27;s not real aggressive, so it&#x27;s a great starting point. Used with an aggressive blade, it&#x27;s an excellent combination. I use the green Astra blades. No razor burn, no weepers, etc.  I change blades once a week, and shave every day. I don&#x27;t use any pre shave oil, and only use shaving soap. I highly recommend Stirling soap. Best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Update: 4/2/2017  Almost six years later and this razor is still going strong. It has saved me probably well over $200 at this point if I had stuck with the expensive multi-bladed razors sold in stores.  The razor barely has any discoloration even after all this time, although the nooks and crannies where the whole thing fastens together are a little smudged looking, but that is just because they are hard to clean without something smaller than a toothbrush. Otherwise, the exterior is pretty much just as shiny as the day I bought it.  I don&#x27;t doubt I&#x27;ll get another six years out of this thing -- maybe more!   **ORIGINAL REVIEW** Purchased Sept, 2011  I might as well have been born with razor burn. I have tried many different razors, cremes, etc., but no matter what I tried I always got razor burn on the sides of my chin.  I have used the infamous disposable razors (who hasn&#x27;t?) with the single blade and I have used the popular 5,031 blade razors whose replacements cost $20 per 4 pack. All of these things would regularly upset some part of my skin, with the only place never really having any issue(s) being my neck.  I broke this beast out when it came in the mail and just so happened to need a shave. I went a little slower than usual as having been forced to actually put the blade in myself made me realize that its about as thin as paper. It scared me just a tad as I was afraid I was going to cut my throat. The razor fit perfectly in my hand as I am not a muscle dude with big canned hams and I was able to maneuver nicely.  I only nicked myself once on my first-ever safety razor shave, so not bad in my opinion. My face feels smooth and I applied some good moisturizers so we&#x27;ll see if my skin flares up with the small bumps it loves so much.  Overall, I like the product (it feels very durable).</li>
    <li> Screw thread wore out. Only had it for a year.</li>
    <li> Great item. Great quality. Great craftsmanship.</li>
    <li> Wow!  I can&#x27;t believe how many years I wasted with the Mach III nonsense.  Though I have a badger brush and use shaving soap, I just never got a perfect shave.  All that changed when I used this razor.  The razor is solidly built, fits nicely and glides smooth.  Not only did I notice the huge difference in the closeness and smooth shave, but my wife did as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking to become a DE wet shaver, buy this.  Leave the Mach III to our nations aviators!</li>
    <li> This is my first razor. It is very well made and felt very solid in hand. I expected its super performance as I read all the good reviews of this and also reviews of razors in general. However, its initial performance is far from good. My skin felt very irritating after a few uses. So I was about to return to my old way of shaving. Right before I quit, I decided to give it another try with the Personna blade I bought together with this razor. That blade turned this razor into an excellent shaving tool. The shaving is smooth and my skin is so clean that I kept touching it today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here is my conclusion: The blade matters. The razor is great when it is matched with a sharp blade. The Derby blades that came with the razor didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor after reading many positive reviews about it.  I don&#x27;t have a really heavy beard but I need to shave every day for work.  I have been wetshaving for some time and I own two Merkur razors and a Parker.  This razor is as good or better than the Merkurs.  It is well made and exceptionally well finished with the shiniest chrome finish I have ever seen.  I purchased it because it was reported as a mild shaver which was very forgiving.  It gives an excellent and mild shave that gets me as close as anything else I have ever used.  I have the model with the lined chrome handle which is very easy to grip and hold.  I&#x27;ve seen the same model advertised with a plastic accent on the handle but I thought they might tend to be slippery so I passed on them.    This razor is an excellent product for me and I don&#x27;t think it will disappoint anyone else.</li>
    <li> One of the best razors on the market.</li>
    <li> This thing is ridiculous! The finish on this thing is immaculate! The weight of it is near perfect. Every man should own one of these guys, I didn&#x27;t really like the Derby blades it came with. But love this razor.</li>
    <li> Excellent razor all around. If I saw this in a store for $150 I wouldn&#x27;t have a second thought about it being worth as much. Solid construction, well chromed. I have the \\&quot;barley\\&quot; finish on mine; handle looks great and provides a good amount of grip, more than what you&#x27;d get from the standard or lined model, I imagine. Worth the extra ten bucks for aesthetics alone. Shaves really well and seems like it&#x27;ll last a lifetime (or three). Would recommend anyone looking for a DE razor to check out any of the Edwin Jagger DL89 variants.</li>
    <li> This is not as robust a razor as I expected.  It is made of solid material, and as such is heavy, but it is not very precision allowing the blade to ride differently on the skin from the middle to the edges of the razor.</li>
    <li> The razor is well-made, elegant and completely functional.  Everything I expected.  The shave is close but not aggressive.  Service was fast and easy.</li>
    <li> I picked up the De89lbl shortly after taking up wet shaving.  I had nailed down the basics and was expanding my collection to get a better idea of the different styles, shapes, lengths weights, aggressiveness, etc.  I&#x27;ve bought several other razors since, both new and vintage, and I have to say this is by far my absolute favorite.  I love it so much I&#x27;m hard pressed to use the other razors in my cabinet.  Why?  I&#x27;ll be happy to tell you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the fit and finish on this thing is absolutely amazing.  The chrome plating is far superior to every other razor I have.  It has a deeper shine than I thought a razor could have.  Holding and looking at it, this razor just exudes quality.  Second, it has a heft and balance that is unmatched by my other razors.  The head is moderately aggressive.  I&#x27;ve settled on Feather and Wilkinson Sword as the best two blades for this razor and with either one the razor just glides over my face.  I almost never have to do a second pass.  Third, the pattern and diameter of the handle is perfect for my large hands. I have yet to cut myself due to the handle slipping regardless of how wet or slippery my hands have been.  Finally, the three piece design is much easier to clean and replace than I imagined it would be.  A quick run underneath the water, unscrew the shaft, wipe down each piece with a towel, reassemble, and you&#x27;ve got a gorgeous and spotless razor in about 30 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for your new go-to daily use razor, look no further.  Just realize that your other blades will soon start collecting dust.  If you must only own one razor (though why would you ever want to do that??) this is the one.  You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this as a gift for my brother-in-law. I really just wanted something shiny, simple, inexpensive, and retro (my mother-in-law already purchased a nice pen set for him, so this was Plan B). It was only after the razor was on its way did I realize there was an entire shaving subculture dedicated to bringing back this seemingly lost activity.   After reading rave reviews, I bought one for myself. Until this purchase, shaving had always just been a chore to be completed quickly using bar soap and cheap disposable razors in the shower. Cheap disposables were still better than electric razors and they lasted me a week, so they worked. Until I tried this razor...  The weight of the razor was the first thing I noticed. It&#x27;s substantial. I knew navigating this razor around my face would take extra care, so I watched a few videos before attempting it myself. \\&quot;Don&#x27;t push...let the weight of the razor do the work\\&quot; was the common mantra. At first it didn&#x27;t even feel like I had done anything aside from clearing lather off my face. Perhaps my angle was wrong? I rinsed, and after one pass I couldn&#x27;t believe how smooth my skin felt. No cuts or nicks, just smooth skin.   Since that experience a few weeks ago, I ordered additional blades. I tried the Sharks, but wasn&#x27;t impressed. I ordered a cheap brush and shaving soap, but I still prefer my canned shaving gel. I researched vintage models, different shaving soaps, different face preparations, and different aftershaves but at this stage I don&#x27;t feel the strong need to spend any more money or time with this. I&#x27;m very happy with what I have now. I may continue experimenting with different blades (I have two unopened packs of Feathers), but the Derbys that the razor came with are doing a great job on my face.   I hope my brother-in-law is equally as impressed with this gift as I was.</li>
    <li> Nice razor. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year without a glitch.</li>
    <li> I have not used a safety razor in forty years. I switch back and was a little bit imintimadated by the razor at first. It works great. I have thin skin no cuts using this razor. My only problem with the razor is you have to disacemable it to put a blade in ti. Maybe that why I have not cute my self.</li>
    <li> Very excellent razor. Top notch chroming even on the inside of the head. My merkur future doesn&#x27;t even have chrome on the inside of the head. Very well balanced and is a non aggressive shaver. I don&#x27;t think you could get much better than this razor. I shave my head with it and sometimes I wish it was a little more aggressive but for the most part it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this razor! I was previously using a Gillette Ball End Tech that I picked up new for a few bucks which worked great but I wanted to expand a bit. At the time (I&#x27;ve owned this for over a year now) I was trying to decide between the EJ 89L or the Merkur HD 34C and decided on this one for a couple reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Price: It was cheaper than the Merkur at the time by about $15 with free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;2) Finish: There were a lot more complaints about the finish on the Merkur flaking. Even though they replaced them easily enough, I really didn&#x27;t want to have to go through that.&lt;br /&gt;3) Length: This is really a personal preference but I really don&#x27;t care for short handled razors so naturally I would&#x27;ve preferred this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the lined barrel one instead of the smooth as I was worried it could slip easily but I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the grip and haven&#x27;t dropped it once. So for anyone is in the market for a razor, whether you&#x27;re just starting or looking to add to your collection, I recommend this one highly. Photos really can&#x27;t do justice on the beauty of this razor, you will be in awe when you first open it and admire it every time you go to shave.</li>
    <li> I got this because I got fed up with the crappy expensive or throw away razors.  My first choice would have been an single edge injector but the razors are hard to find and used.  So I went with this because of the ratings here and and other sites.  I must say I was very happy.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 was that I believe my old adjustable Gellette Easyload/Bombbay door razor was better and I re-curse the family member that threw away my old one. But this sure beats supposedly modern alternative.  I got some irritation but it&#x27;s been a while and I pressed too hard plus I didn&#x27;t use a shave oil.  But I knew when I hit my face with that hot brush and soap that it would be different.  It was as good as a payed for shave.  Smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt as they say.  With a little more care and a shave oil it will be better for my sensitive skin than the 100 blade systems and canned shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;If you have never tried it I would recommend it.  If you have and have fallen for the BS the blade companies are spreading retry it.  The only thing I would change would be to easier to load and adjust.  But I have no plans to make a change yet.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll let you know how it goes over time.</li>
    <li> The chrome on this thing is epic in its chromeness (I know its not a word). Shaves great, didn&#x27;t slit my throat on my first ever DE shave!</li>
    <li> I bought this razor in October of 2012. I have used it nearly every day since. In the summer this year I bought a second razor by another manufacturer because I have really come to enjoy the shave these razors allow. This morning I used this razor and after cleaning and drying it I attempted to put it back together and it will not \\&quot;thread\\&quot; the handle to the head. It is now useless. It is less than 11 months old. I then found out the famous Amazon return policy is only for items within the first 30 days of delivery. I did not know this before. A nearly $50.00 safety razor should last years in my opinion and if it does not the manufacturer should repair or replace the razor. Let the prospective buyer beware...this is a really expensive disposable razor!</li>
    <li> You will certainly enjoy this razor. First time safety razor user here, I bought this razor because, I&#x27;m tired of the ridiculous prices for Fusion disposable blades. You will not be disappointed by purchasing this razor. The shave is so much closer and smoother than any disposable has to offer. No nicks or cuts. I just listened to what others had to say about using safety razors... (Don&#x27;t apply pressure, use a decent lather, and let the razor do the work). Give it a try, you&#x27;ll never use a disposable again. Happy Shaving</li>
    <li> Before purchasing, around a month was spent researching which razor would be my best choice with the Edwin Jagger came out on top.   I put the order in to Amazon and at first I was a bit bummed.   The item description read that it would take 3-4 weeks for it to be shipped so I prepared myself for the long haul.   Barely 4 days later, Amazon sent me a message that it has shipped and it would make it to me in less than two days!       Once I popped it out of the cardboard container I was quite surprised.  The heft is pretty weighty in the hand, but it is extremely well balanced.  This concerned me a bit.   The foremost thought was that it would be too heavy to properly shave with.   After all, I am coming from the world of disposable razor cartridges (Mach 3).  Secondly, I was struck by the craftsmanship.   The fit to my hand is just right in a normal shaving grip, upside down, and cross-face orientations.   Viewed from any angle the chrome finish is gorgeous, and although the handle is chromed it is textured with a lined pattern so it stays grippy even wet or when shaving cream is on your fingers.  You might think that the only thing that could make it better would be if it were a butterfly-type head, but when it comes to dependability and resistance to wear and tear I&#x27;ll take the Edwin Jagger&#x27;s simple screw-on method versus one that has moving parts any day of the week.    Without any sort of \\&quot;purchaser bias\\&quot;, I can honestly say the razor performs superbly.   My typical shave is in the shower with no mirror, so I jumped right into it with my new double edge safety razor.  This might seem scary to some, but with practice you&#x27;ll know the contours of your face by using your touch to check for missed spots.  I admit, even with years of no-mirror shaving, that I was a little nervous.  The end result of the first shave was excellent!  It was all baby butt smooth, no nicks, and just a 1/2\\&quot; circular spot of razor burn (went away by mid-day), which wouldn&#x27;t have happened butI held the handle too loosely on a tricky part.    Economy was another consideration I had when making the switch.  Let&#x27;s see, a Gillette Fusion 16 pack for $41.25 or Derby DE Razorblades 30Ct for $5?  No contest!   In a very short amount of time, in fact the first time you need another package of cartridges, the Gillette becomes much more costly.  As time goes on the division of value gets even larger.       A quick piece of advice: be confident!   More nicks will happen from your uncertainty than anything else.   Just be aware that what you&#x27;re holding is many times sharper than cartridge razors and to treat it accordingly.   Two weeks in of daily shaving and I haven&#x27;t had any nicks or cuts.  Also, be sure to change the blade when you start to notice a less smooth shave.   There is no proscribed time other than ~4ish days, but it can vary, based on your facial hair.   Some people have lots of hair that is soft, so they can go 5 or 6 days.  I don&#x27;t have that much, but each individual hair is very course and thick so I replace the blade at the beginning of every 5th day.  While others have a ton of course thick hair and need to replace the beginning of the 4th day.    Quick summary: I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase.  I&#x27;ve got a great looking piece of kit that gives me a smooth shave every time.  Plus, traveling around to other countries is infinitely more simple with the Edwin Jagger than a cartridge razor.  You can always find DE razor blades around at extremely cheap prices, compared to the hassle of finding the right cartridge for your handle or the need of buying another handle with cartridges because they don&#x27;t carry what you need.</li>
    <li> Excellent  quality  heavy-duty  wish I&#x27;d  found this  sooner</li>
    <li> A work of art, just beautiful. I had researched about 80 de razors before ordering this one, I am so glad I chose it. The quality is about as perfect as anything I have ever purchased. I would have paid five times the price to own this piece of art. The Crome, I mean, THE CROME!!! Lol is just the deepest shine and flawless as a mirror. All the angles have been engineered  smooth without sharp points, so it glides perfectly across my skin. This razor is not too aggressive but I would say in the middle. It washes up very easy and shines as the water flings right off of it. If I look at it very close I find it hard to believe it was so inexpensive. What a joy! Oh, the balance is just right. The raised rings are placed to indicate the right place to grip for proper hold for a close shave. The best shave so far. Buy one, NOW!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh by the way, the blades are very gentle on ya too.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of this same safety razor. My first is still in immaculate condition after two years of use. The design is perfect IMO.</li>
    <li> I decided, like most others, go enter the realm of wet shaving due to the high cost of replacement cartridges for my razor and the fact that using a brush, soap and an old-school razor appealed to a part of me that is striving for simplicity these days.  This is a great-looking razor and provides a close shave.  My only point of contention is that I find it difficult to hold on to this razor because of the smooth handle.  It is shiny and slippery and I find that the only way i can get an adequate grip is to make sure my hands and razor are completely dry which is hard to do when wet shaving!  Maybe some people will not have this problem, but it is an issue with me.  Today I have ordered a Merkur model 180 long-handled razor which has a knurling on the handle.  I hope this solves my problem.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor for over a month and it&#x27;s better than disposable I have ever used, I&#x27;m still on the original blade and I have a very tough beard.  Great product</li>
    <li> I love this safety razor. The best choice!</li>
    <li> Same shave as a less expensive double edge razor</li>
    <li> Great handle. I broke my first one dropping it in the shower and had to purchase another one. A costly mistake, but I won&#x27;t be going back to regular (Gillette Mach 5, etc.) razors again.</li>
    <li> This is actually my first safety razor and I am definitely sold (on this one at least).  I was also given a micro touch one for Christmas and with the right blades it can be decent but it doesn&#x27;t hold a candle to the Edwin Jagger 89.  The weight on this razor is perfect.  It&#x27;s a solid, quality piece and my face is the smoothest it&#x27;s been in quite some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the Feather blades in this razor but they were way too harsh/sharp for me causing major razor burn and bumps.  In the micro touch one they worked much better on my face.  This is a great razor and  has turned shaving into a fun experience.  I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This razor is a easily held razor with some heft to it. Weighs in at 2.65 oz., with a blade installed.  I have medium sized hands.  For those with big hands, i think a longer handle would be necessary.  I have tried this razor with 6 blades, three each of Personna, and Derby Extra.  I still have three other samples that I want to use.&lt;br /&gt;Thus far, I am more pleased using the Personna.  The Derby blades seem to drag.  I have drawn blood 3 times (my fault), twice going over moles, and once at the R corner of my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;It has been at least 40 years since I used a D/E razor.  Started in 1958 or 9 using Blue Blades, and stuck with that blade for a couple of years.  Stainless blades lasted longer.  I finally trashed my D/E/ Gillette &#x27;butterfly&#x27; to move to a single edge blade, moving through a succession of razors including the Sensor, Mach 3 Turbo, and Fusion.  I returned to the D/E razor to save a bit of money.  Retired now, I shave on a 3 day cycle (unless society calls).  For those occasions when I need a really close shave, I use the Fusion.  Otherwise the D/E is sufficient.  It would have been entirely sufficient 5 days/week for the front office.  Might be my advancing years (memory and all) but this razor and blades do seem to pull a bit.  I might find better blades in the future.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly. Returned. Handle was too short.</li>
    <li> This was my first DE razor and I&#x27;m glad I made the switch. First use was a little rough, but once you get the hang of it you will never go back to the mach-17 garbage. Only negative is that the handle can get kinda slippery in a wet hand.</li>
    <li> I first want to say am new to the DE razor scene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I was putting together my kit and after watching tutorials/reviews I decided I wanted a Badger shaving brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased with along with :&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfecto 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush&lt;br /&gt;Personna Double Edge Razor Blades, 100 Count ...&lt;br /&gt;Edwin Jagger DE89Lbl Lined Detail Chrome Plated...&lt;br /&gt;Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing is absolutely beautiful, very well weighted, I was so nervous to get into the DE scene because of stories from my mother of the olden days and her father coming out with TP all over his face. However, there was no reason to fear it is so gentle you just cant go at a million miles an hour with these razors. Take your time and enjoy! These would make a great gift for a brother, son, or father (I am 28).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually look forward to my shave now, its almost like a ritual (sick I know)...</li>
    <li> This is my first DE razor, and I have been using it for a couple months now.  It has worked excellently, and is beautifully smooth and shiny as an added bonus.  At first it does feel as if the handle is a little short, but one quickly realizes that no additional length is needed, or even particularly desirable.  I have tried it with Feathers, Derbys, Sharks, and Bluebirds, and my conclusion is that the blade makes all the difference in the world as to the success of the shave, but the razor not so much (although the weight does actually help with the shave). (BTW, I also bought a Parker 22R DE razor and used it as a comparison to the Edwin Jagger.)  My conclusions about the blades are: 1) The Feathers can last up to 20-25 shaves per blade but are dangerously sharp and WILL draw blood frequently on the first several shaves, 2) The Derbys are very forgiving but are usually done after about 4-5 shaves, 3) The Sharks are a little sharper than the Derbys, but still fairly forgiving and DEFINITELY last longer, up to 6-7 shaves per blade, and 4) The Bluebirds seem largely indistinguishable from the Derbys, but might be just a little sharper initially.  I have decided to standardize on the Sharks, and at about $0.18 per blade per week the long-term savings will be quite substantial.    So, get this razor, get a good shave cream/soap/oil (I like Proraso and Speick), maybe a good shaving cream brush, and give it a try!</li>
    <li> Assuming a decent initial beard preparation routine, these blades really do the job.  No pulls, no nicks, and no remaining untouched beard.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor, well made, nice weight, smooth shave. I am fairly new to DE shaving, and I own a Merkur, and a Parker, but this is by far the better razor. Those are really good razors, and I&#x27;m not knocking them, but this is my favorite. If you are new to DE shaving, start with this one.</li>
    <li> I like many others got tired of paying the high prices for 3+  blades. I had no idea when I started out looking for an alternative that I would also find a much better shave. I typically shaved every week not because the hair growth is slow but I hated to shave. Shaving every week or longer turned out to add to the problems (all the tugging and clogging). With this DE razor I can shave as often as needed or when I want. Even if I go the week or two I was before no problem. If you are thinking about trying traditional wet shaving do it. I had no idea a shave could be this good. I thought it was suppose to be painful. Now I know I don&#x27;t have to suffer. Not all blades are the same so if starting out you will need to try them until you find the best one for you. On top of great shaves it \\&quot;saves money\\&quot;! Some of you know what I mean when I say \\&quot;saves money\\&quot; or you will find out soon enough. In the the long term you will! You do the math 10 shaves (2 blades) at about $0.36 vs 10 shaves with the 3+ blades at $2.75+ (more for different systems). I say 10 shaves for two reasons first of all I will give them the benefit and second who wants to throw a blade away after 3 shaves when it costs so much. I little learning curve and don&#x27;t get discouraged if your blade doesn&#x27;t work try another till you find the right one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now have a cheaper alternative and better shaves! What else could I ask for.</li>
    <li> I really like it but may try the adjustable item soon. it may have unexpected benefits If it is &amp;#34;as good&amp;#34;, fine; if it is &amp;#34;better&amp;#34;, excellent!</li>
    <li> Well, it&#x27;s taken 4 shaves...but I&#x27;ve finally &amp;#34;seen the light&amp;#34;....The first few shaves I was using this like a Gillette Mach 3....pressing hard on my face with long quick strokes.  After doing a lot of research, I&#x27;m letting the razor&#x27;s weight do the work, and using short, 1 inch strokes.  I have a heavy beard, and have been shaving 6 days a week for over 20 years.  This razor, along with the Astra Premium Platinum, gives me a shave like I&#x27;ve never had before in my life.  My face is still smooth at night, and barely any &amp;#34;5 o&#x27;clock shadow&amp;#34;....I&#x27;m still experimenting with the best shaving soap/lather for my face, but overall, best shaving experience of my life.</li>
    <li> I never shaved with this razor as I wanted to be able to return it. I can comment that when holding the razor it was a bit uncomfortable because of the short handle. I started out shaving with a safety razor with a 4\\&quot; handle. This one is too short. I recommend trying the Merkur #180. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002FC7B2G/ref&#x3D;oh_o00_s00_i00_details  It also has excellent reviews and has a longer handle making the grip easier.</li>
    <li> I had used all the latest high tech razors and was tired of paying 5 or 6 dollars for a cartridge that would last 2 or 3 weeks. I got this razor and 5 extra blades. It works great and I&#x27;m not going back to the Mach 3 or Gillette products. I took it slow at first and now I have complete confidence using this as I would any razor. It hasn&#x27;t cut me like some of the others did yet. Very happy.</li>
    <li> This razor is awesome.  I love it.  It comes apart and goes back together easily.  Depending on your water and cream/foam, you will need to clean it quite frequently.  I basically just use alcohol and toothbrush and cotton.</li>
    <li> This review is written from a first time wet shaver&#x27;s experiences, beginning with this razor.  I will update as I gain experience and figure things out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great razor.  I can see why leisureguy&#x27;s guide to gourmet shaving, recommended this for beginning safety razor users.  I would imagine this is also a great razor for experienced shavers, but I am not there yet.  I have been an electric shaver for 20+ years with the occasional foray into the multibladed cartridge razor.  I must say I was a little frightened of going into the safety razor side of shaving with all the stories of learning curve nicks and cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My concerns of using the safety razor where soon to be relaxed.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong I agree that you definitely have to be present during the process of shaving with this razor, but nothing as scary as what I was expecting, but I get ahead of myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s start with the razor itself.  First surprise.  The box was simple and classy, but it was much smaller than what I was expecting, I am so used the the Schick cartride razors with long handles (necessary to lever and apply pressure to the shaving head) that I was quite surprised to see how short it was.  As soon as I held it, the weight and balance was very apparent.  The packaging was simplistic and stylish, wrapped in tissue paper, it does give you the feel that you purchased it from a small shop in England.  The craftsmanship is superb, I took apart and inspected, no tool marks, and fit was perfect.  Blade was installed easily and sat evenly, unlike some reviews I have read with other razors where the blade did not sit symmetrically.  My wife came home and saw it on the chrome stand and even commented how classy it looked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the shave.  It comes with 5 derby blades.  The shave is done with these and since this is my first shave with a DE razor, it will be based on this.  Initially very concerned with making sure I achieved the right angle so as not to butcher myself I was pleasantly surprised to find that the curve of the razor top and the safety bar pretty much guide you.  It was much easier than I had thought.  The blades are extremely sharp and in fact if I hadn&#x27;t read to listen to the hairs being cut I would have thought I had to shallow of an angle.  This was an amazing smooth shave.  I nicked myself twice in three passes, well I should say I nicked a mole that gets nicked whenever I shave with any blade so that doesn&#x27;t really count (although I must say I didn&#x27;t even feel it happen, cartidge razor usually makes me flinch here), the second nick was my fault again as I found myself applying a bit too much pressure while shaving over a traditionally rough patch for me (not because I needed to but out of habit from my old razor).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I had a great first shave.  I highly recommend this razor.  I will continue to update as I gain more experience with this shaver, I also am awaiting a sample blade pack so that I can experiment with different blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  Am Still trying blades, but I do recommend that you also go through the sample packs to find the right blade for you.  While I thought the Derby blade that came with the razor were very good, it turns out that while delving into my first sample pack I have already found blades that greatly enhance the shave and performance of this razor.  This is a great razor, I highly recommend it, and have already send one to my brother, who is now a DE razor convert as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also highly recommend you take the time for beard prep prior to shave.  There is a noticeable improvement in shave closeness and reducing razor burn with pre shave prep.  I have started using the edwin jagger preshave lotion which has even further improved the experience, and it just feels good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And for all of you old hands out there, thanks for all the posts, reviews and blogs.  It has been a great help.ed to find that the curve of the razor top and the safety bar pretty much guide you.  It was much easier than I had thought.

    <li> Best razor I&#x27;ve ever owned! Well worth the money. If you&#x27;re thinking of buying this razor... don&#x27;t hesitate!</li>
    <li> He felt it gave him an amazing shave..... best he has ever had.  Do not press down.  As others have said, \\&quot;let it glide in the direction you are shaving,and you will get an amazing shave!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m switching from an electric shaver, so you can imagine there&#x27;s a bigger learning curve for me than for those who are switching from cartridge razors. My electric never got a very close shave and caused irritation from having to rub the head over the same areas again and again.    From other reviews I anticipated my first shave with the Edwin Jagger to be difficult and cause a bunch of nicks, but in the end it took me barely any longer than it had with my electric, and I only gave myself two very tiny nicks on the thinner, more sensitive skin where my neck meets my jaw. My second shave was a bit quicker than with the electric, even including lathering up and cleaning the razor, and I didn&#x27;t nick myself at all. The razor handles very well. Shortly after ordering, I became worried that the handle might not be long enough. I have large hands but relatively short, stubby fingers. In practice, however, it actually feels very good in my hand; the weighting is just right and the detailing helps me keep a good grip on it. Depending on the size of your hands your mileage may vary.    Both times I only required two passes to get every single hair. The shave was closer than with the electric, though it could still be a bit closer. No matter, though; I got a sample pack of different blades to find which I like best, and I&#x27;ll try to find one in there that&#x27;s just a tiny bit more aggressive. So with the Edwin Jagger I got a closer and quicker shave than my electric, without the irritation, at half the price. Even including the Proraso shaving soap, Tweezerman lathering brush, and blade sample pack, I spent no more altogether than my electric cost. What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
    <li> I started shaving  in the 1970&#x27;s using a bonded blade and then gravitated to the multi blades because of advertising .I went back to DE shaving after seeing the Pawn Star guys infomercial about the MicroTouch razor.  I purchased one after doing the math on replacement blades.  I was using a multi blade razor and spending an arm and leg for replacements.  The Micro touch was ok but decided to find something better.  After research I chose the EJ DE89Lbl, because of the reviews I read.  I then gave my son the Micro Touch so he could start using DE razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was first class and the Derby blades that came with it were ok.  I recommend this razor to anyone looking for a quality razor either beginner of veteran wet shaver.</li>
    <li> I love a good tool and this is a beauty. So well made it will make you a proud owner and you will be glad you paid a little more for it.  Might have gotten the longer handle version but I am getting used to it.  Good buy to low priced handles that sucker you into buying high priced throw away cartridges.  Enjoy.</li>
    <li> I like this razor a lot; it&#x27;s beautifully made, and looks as elegant as it feels. The only knock on it is that it&#x27;s a little slippery when wet, which happens to be a bad thing for a wet shave. Not a deal breaker by any means, just something that took some getting used to. My preference was for a heavier razor anyway, and I ended up with a Merkur HD (forget the #). Gave this to my brother who loves it.</li>
    <li> First of all, shaving with a double edged razor is AMAZING. It is so much better than cartridge shaving. Smoother shave, less irritation and far more satisfying. I only use my razor with Barbasol shaving cream to simplicity&#x27;s sake. If you don&#x27;t have one, get one. You absolutely won&#x27;t regret it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Edwin Jagger is a fantastic razor and far better than I anticipated it could possibly be compared to cartridge shaving. However, the notches on the Edwin Jagger are all vertical (like a classic Greek column), which makes it sometimes slippery when you have shaving cream on your hands or you are in the shower. Comparative to other frequently sold razors such as the Merkur 180, the weight of the Edwin Jagger is much more substantial and feels more natural.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t believe how great of a shave I get with this razor. So much cheaper and pleasant than those 4 or 5 bladed plastic razors. No more razor burn and I&#x27;m saving a lot of $$$. Do yourself a favor and buy this razor. You won&#x27;t regret it</li>
    <li> I own a Atra, Parker 99R, and now have the Edwin Jagger. The Jagger has given me my best shave ever. I have used multi blades like the Atra that I used for over 20 years. I then tried the 99R and both are ok razors , but the Jagger is the best. I believe I have no need to ever replace the Jagger De89lbl as long as blades are made for DE safety razors. Only thing I would change is make the handel a little bit longer cause I have very large hands.</li>
    <li> My absolute first DE razor and It&#x27;s been great so far. When I feel like purchasing another razor it will not be because there are any problems with this one, but because I feel like trying out something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you are purchasing this because you feel like you have larger hands I have large hands and find the extra length of this razor unnessesscary.</li>
    <li> I did a great deal of research before making this purchase and it paid off.  There is a lot of information available about various razor products.  I have tried the typical over the counter cartridge razors and not only did I find them to fail to get a clean, close, comfortable shave, but the costs add up in a hurry.  Each cartridge costs about $2.50 and over the course of a year, that adds up.  Then I tried Harry&#x27;s razor.  It cut down the cost of the cartidges to a degree, but the shave was not very good.  I was hesitant to go with a safety razor.  I had fears that I would slice my face with the super sharp blades.  But I took the plunge and after just one shave I am thrilled.  I just received the razor yesterday and had my first shave this morning.  The first pass gave me a good shave, but one more pass and I have perhaps the best shave of my life.  And this is just with the razor blades that came with the razor.  I have an order coming with a sampler pack of blades and should be able to fine tune to the best combination for my razor and my beard.  The razor itself is top quality - a beautiful chrome finish, a nice weight and very well manufactured.  The handle is short, but not too short.  The stripes on the handle allow for easy control.  The three-piece design fits together well.  And while there is an intial development in the safety razor, the extraordinarily low cost of the blades will allow me to rocoupe the investment in no time.  I strongly encourage those seeking a close, comfortable shave to jump in and pick up a safety razor and this is the one for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been told by barbers I have very coarse facial hair and am difficult to shave.  I&#x27;ve struggled for years with shaving.  The best I could do were the $40 for 12-16 higher end disposable razors.  I thought I would give this a try.  I was not disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first received it, I was surprised by the short handle as many are.  I understand the need for it in order to balance, but I would say its a little too short even for my small hands.  Loading the razor the first time is a little intimidating, but just be careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the first few shaves it was apparent this was going to be a lot more tricky that the flexible disposable.  My first few shaves were bad, and I wasn&#x27;t sure if I&#x27;d continue using.  However, after a few weeks, I am extremely satisfied, and the blade savings along is well worth it.  I can switch out the double edged blade every week for like 20 cents a week.  Way better than the $2/blade disposable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few tips:&lt;br /&gt;-Patience.  As I said, it takes a while to find your groove with this.  I won&#x27;t repeat how to use, just check online for how to shave properly with double edge safety razors.&lt;br /&gt;-I don&#x27;t believe you have to change your style much-just realize this is a precision instrument.  I still shave once with the grain and once against.  I get the smoothest shave ever.&lt;br /&gt;-Your chin and a few other curves are very hard to get smooth.  Just keep practicing and you will understand how to focus on it and get it right.&lt;br /&gt;-Buy a variety of blades and try a new one each week.  Eventually you&#x27;ll find the one that works for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great buy...definitely don&#x27;t hesitate to try.  The blade savings alone are huge!</li>
    <li> This is my first DES-Razor. It&#x27;s so well put together that it might be my last. I&#x27;m very happy I waited until I came across it.</li>
    <li> Tried this razor for a first time: could not even finish shaving - had to switch to my old one. The razor appears to be well made, and that&#x27;s about it on the positive side. The problem is that the handle is too short and too smooth. I have a medium to large hands with very agile long fingers, and I could not get a good grip on the handle, and I was not in the shower (I normally shave in the shower). The handle must be at least one inch longer and have ridges for the best control, like all classic German razors. I am returning this one.</li>
    <li> My first de razor. Bought after reading reviews. Works great!</li>
    <li> For the first time since I was about 13 years old, I actually look forward to shaving.  Traditional shaving is genuinely satisfying, with a nice warm lather; a solid, sturdy razor (not plastic); and a really sharp blade that requires skill to master.  The Razor--  The EJ DE89L razor deserves every one of the 5-stars I gave it.  Top quality construction, well designed, I expect it will last a lifetime.    I&#x27;m new to double-edged (DE) shaving and I&#x27;m glad I chose this razor for learning.  It is a \\&quot;medium aggressive\\&quot; razor, not so mild that you don&#x27;t get a good shave, yet not so aggressive that you have to use a lot of care.  More experienced DE shavers say it is not only good for learning, I won&#x27;t \\&quot;outgrow\\&quot; it.    If you do any research at all on this razor, you&#x27;ll find that it is the \\&quot;go to\\&quot; razor these days.  You&#x27;ll also hear/read about guys praising the chrome plating.  It is very well done.  I was worried at first that they were enamored with this razor just because of its looks, but it is equally good at shaving.    Edwin Jagger is an English company, from Sheffield.  The razor&#x27;s head is made in Germany, under a joint venture with Muhle, a German company.  It is a 3-piece razor.  The handle, the base, and the cap are all separate pieces. This makes it easy to clean.  Changing blades is a bit \\&quot;fiddly\\&quot; at first, but I think I could do it now with my eyes closed.  The secret is to turn the razor upside down.  I typically flip it and rest the cap on a towel, unscrew the handle, then flip the cap over to let the base and blade drop off.  Then I reverse the process with a new blade.  Some have complained about the short handle.  For me it was more of adjusting to this razor after using long handles on  cartridge razors.  However, technique is different for the two types of razors.  With the cartridge razors I tended to grasp the whole handle.  To keep from using too much pressure with a DE, most guys just hold it with the tips for their first three fingers.  Using thatgrip there is plenty of room, even enough to vary my grip--near the tip, at the balance point, or near the top.  Also, I haven&#x27;t had a problem with the handle being slippery, unless it gets lather on it.  You can also wet your fingers on an alum block for extra grip if you feel you need it (an alum block is good to have anyway).  Traditional Shaving--  I&#x27;m very glad I switched to traditional shaving.  There is a learning curve, but I&#x27;m now getting shaves that are closer than I was getting with either the electric or multi-blade razors. My skin is much healthier looking, and no rashes or bumps. I do get a little razor burn, but as I get better, there is less and less, and it usually disappears by noon.  I see the day coming when it will be the exception.  As for the healthier looking skin, I&#x27;ve heard mass-market shaving foam is hard on it.  I can think of no other reason why there would be such a difference.  I will also save enough money on blades in the first 6 months to pay off my brush, the razor, and blades.  DE blades are typically less than $.50 apiece, some less then $.20 per blade.  If you decide to switch to DE shaving, I recommend learning about it first.  The technique is very different from using a cartridge razor.  There is a wealth of information on the shaving forums.  Badger and Blade is a good one (badgerandblade.com).  Check out their Wiki.  There are also excellent instructional videos on YouTube produced by both \\&quot;Mantic59\\&quot; and \\&quot;Geofatboy.\\&quot;  Blades--  I  recommend you buy a sampler pack of blades to learn on.  Get a pack with at least five different types of blades.  The Derby blades that come with this razor work for some people, but they are too mild for my beard.  When you get the sampler pack,  work through them using at least two blades of each type until you find one that seems to work the best for you.  If you choose this route -- enjoy!!  Edit:  I&#x27;ve been using this razor now for four months and I&#x27;m still happy with it.  Razor burn is minimal now, and when it happens, I know what I did wrong.  I mentioned above that my skin is improving.  I get compliments now on how nice my skin looks, from people who have no idea that I shave DE.  Not bad for a middle-aged guy.  My routine is to use a man&#x27;s face-wash, shave with traditional soap, rinse with Thayers Witch Hazel, use Nivea after-shave balm (when the weather&#x27;s cold and dry).  I&#x27;ve always used a face-wash and the Nivea in cold weather.  The only thing I changed was the way I shave and I added the Witch Hazel.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor as I was looking for quality that will last a lifetime. I&#x27;ve not used the Merkur brand yet although I plan to add one (#34C) of those too. Comparing the Edwin Jagger to my old Schick Kronas is night and day difference. The Jagger is quality made, fit and finish, and simply put is a precision instrument. The 5 Derby blades that come with it are head and shoulders above the trash blades I picked up at the local pharmacy and they align perfectly in the razor. The Derby blades are available for around $15/200 on Amazon so will also be ordering those. The razor itself has nice weight that glides across your face. If you let it do the work rather than pressing it into your skin, you will have no problems with irritation or cuts. Patience is a virtue. My beard is heavy/coarse and I&#x27;ve yet to find a disposable cartridge razor that comes close to the cut I get using the Jagger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure what all the fuss is about in the reviews about people using a double edge razor and complaining of cutting themselves. It&#x27;s like anything else, use care and pay attention to what you are doing and you will get an expert shave without irritation or nicks on your face. Preparation is key. Start with a wash cloth soaked in hot water placed across the beard/face. After repeating this process several times, wet your face then lather it up using circular motion with a badger brush. Start with short downward strokes with the grain of your beard not putting pressure on the razor but rather, let the weight of the razor do the work for you. Rinse the razor often. Afterwards, rinse your face with cold water to close the pores and then apply your favorite after-shave or balm.</li>
    <li> The finish on this razor is simply amazing. This is like looking at a beautifully chromed Harley Davidson. If I never used it for shaving, I would frame it and hang it on the wall.  But I do shave with it. It is the smoothest shaving razor in my stable of 10 razors. It does not \\&quot;bite\\&quot; you if you have an occasional lapse of technique like other more \\&quot;aggressive\\&quot; razors might, yet it rewards you with a smooth shave. I am always happy with the shave I get and how smoothly the razor performed.  It&#x27;s a perfect razor for the DE (double edge) beginner, but seasoned DE veterans also appreciate its performance.  And have I mentioned how amazing the finish looks? :)  It&#x27;s nicely balanced and feels comfortable in your hand while using it.  When I first looked at the handle, I thought it might be a little slippery when wet, but I&#x27;ve had no problems at all using the DE89L  with wet hands.  I rotate the DE razors I use each day, because I&#x27;m a DE fanatic, but if I was forced at gunpoint to pick one razor to use every day, the DE89L would be my choice.</li>
    <li> I was so looking forward to receiving my first Edwin Jagger safety razor. Many have described this razor as one of the shiniest things they own, and have praised Edwin Jagger for its attention to detail. Imagine my surprise, then, when the razor I received from Amazon was dirty and tarnished, filled with a rusty, used blade. To boot, the set of blades included with this product was already opened. Its crumpled cellophane wrapper greeted me at the bottom of the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recognize that mistakes happen, but this lack of quality control was particularly disgusting. It was my introduction to wet shaving, and it wasn&#x27;t a pleasant one. The whole point of buying a modern safety razor is that it is a beautiful, high-quality object, and while I may eventually try my luck again, I must be honest that this has given me some pause.</li>
    <li> Did a lot of reviewing on YouTube before i bought this. I really love this and I am new to wet shaving and getting better each time. This is a great product but I wish the handle was just a little longer. I would definitely buy again. If you like quality this is top notch.</li>
    <li> A first class razor and certainly the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> Well made and works as described. The price was reasonable for the look quality, I&#x27;ll need to use it for sometime to judge the chrome plating but so far it&#x27;s a very good safety Razor.</li>
    <li> Works even better than I expected and keeps the cost of razor blades down.</li>
    <li> My first experience with a safety razor and I&#x27;m very satisfied.  I can&#x27;t say I know how to properly grade this item, but I will say it helped with my razor burn over time.  Lathering up, shaving, cold wash, and a post lotion application has saved my face from cheap disposable razors.  Also, holy crap this is much cheaper when buying blades 100 at a time.</li>
    <li> Nice Razor, hefty, shiny. well built.  First time wet shaving and not a nick, not an amazing shave but I feel it will with practice.&lt;br /&gt;  I would recommend this razor</li>
    <li> Was looking for a better shave than the expensive multi-blade systems. Bought the Edwin Jagger as my first DE. Could not be more pleased especially when my Feather blades arrived. (much improved over the Derby&#x27;s shipped with the razor) Like the weight and size. As I read in some of the articles about DE shaving, just let the weight of the razor do the work and slow down. No cuts and a great shave. All up, a great product for the price and performance.</li>
    <li> After two years of regular use, The males threads on the post corroded , the male threads are now completely wore out , Is now useless.</li>
    <li> If you are looking to go to wet shaving this is a great razor to go to! I got tired of spending so much for the multi blade razors! I think I will save a couple of hundred bucks a year on blade expense. This razor shaves great with the derby blades.</li>
    <li> I just decided to jump on the double edge safety razor bandwagon to mainly save money on blades.    This razor is a thing of beauty.  Great finish with no discernable flaws.  Nice weight and length.  The blade sits perfectly square in the head.  Couldn&#x27;t ask for more as far as quality is concerned and the price was reasonable too.  As far as the quality of shave goes, it&#x27;s not any better than what I was getting with my Gillette Fusion, actually worse.  I&#x27;ve been using a homemade pre shave oil made from castor oil, mineral oil, olive oil and a little eucalyptus.  I also use a shaving soap from Burt&#x27;s Bees and a Tweezerman badger hair brush.  This is not a knock on the razor itself. It may be the Derby blades or the fact that I&#x27;ve only had about 7 or 8 shaves and am still getting used to the technique needed for my beard which is very dense and thick.  I haven&#x27;t hacked myself to death but my shaves just haven&#x27;t been as close as I expected.  I ordered some Feather blades to see if there is any difference after I use up the five pack of Derby&#x27;s and report back.  One note: If you use a pre shave oil make sure you wash your hands off before shaving or you&#x27;ll have a problem gripping the razor.  It holds fine in a wet hand but oil is a problem.  Update 11/2/2011:  Now this is more like it. Been shaving now for months with the Feather blades and they are definitely a big step up from the Derby blades. The Feather&#x27;s are extremely sharp so you have to be more comfortable using the Edwin Jagger De89lbl. After going through the five pack of Derby&#x27;s I was pretty proficient at using the razor but I still had to get used to using it with the Feather&#x27;s installed. Once I had a few shaves using the Feather&#x27;s my face has been left silky smooth with much less irritation than my Fusion razor. The De89lbl feels comfortable and natural in my hand and my technique has vastly improved since first using this double edge razor.  I&#x27;ll never go back to the likes of the Fusion again.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy the feel and heft of this razor.  It is well balanced and shaves closely.  I am still learning some of the \\&quot;ins-and-outs\\&quot; of using a DE razor once again, but that is certainly not the razor&#x27;s fault.    The reason why I have dinged the review by one star is that the handle can become a bit slippery if your hands are wet and/or you use a soap that has some moisturizing features.  This is solved by simply making sure that your hands are dry.  Otherwise, the clean handle is cosmetically quite attractive.</li>
    <li> I remember my dad using an old Gillette Safeety Razor and using it myself when I started to shave.  I have tried all the new razors and they do ok but the clog up easy and cost a fortune for blades.  I have gone back to the old style and I LOVE IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver is great, and it will take you abit longer to shave but it is well worth it, only down side as per some of the other reviews is that the handle does become abit hard to hold when wet but if you take your time that is nothing.  Holding it at the right angle and the shave is BUTTER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a great shave then this to me is it, If you are doing it for a Fashion Statement then you have it all WRONG.</li>
    <li> its the greatest de i&#x27;ve ever used. very smooth shave no irritation and easy to use. if you wondering between 2 razors choose this one.</li>
    <li> This is a great item.  I use it every day with enjoyment.  It was well worth the cost.  It took me a week or more to figure out how to shave with a safety blade.  But, now it is effortless.  I&#x27;m saving a ton of money.</li>
    <li> If you wanna shave your beard with a smooth shaver, this is your option. I recommend it. And the quality is amazing.</li>
    <li> Very pleased my husband asked for an old school razor for his birthday and this fit the bill.</li>
    <li> Great well made.  Takes some time to change blades safely.</li>
    <li> Since i started shaving it seems that i change my instrument of choice every couple years. I started as a teenager with an electric razor and was happy with that for a while, then i tried the throw away plastic razors. Those only left my irritated and nicked. After that i caved in and went with a disposable head razor, which worked well enough for a year or so. Not long ago i discovered Safety razors, I remember as a child watching my father and grandfather use these and practicing along with them with a blade less razor. I researched my options on different brand safety razors from vintage Gillette to modern Merkurs and Parkers. I spend a couple days debating my options and while clicking through Amazon i found this Edwin Jagger. I took my time reading the reviews and compared it to the Merkur 34c which was was previous top choice, and From so many positive reviews i dove in and bought the Edwin Jagger and i couldn&#x27;t be happier. At about 8-10 shaves in i have yet to cut myself, and the weight of the razor just glides down my face leaving a closer shave than any of those cartridge razors in my past. An added bonus comes from how cheap the blades are, you can find a 100ct for under $20 which should last you at least a year depending on how often you shave.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s kind of insane how much money I was wasting on disposable razors. This does a better job.</li>
    <li> Like others, I purchased this razor because of two different stimuli. One - I was sick of paying $3 -$4 per cartridge for fancy 4 bladed cartridges, I was looking to save money - but wisely, so Number Two - I like a quality product, no matter what it is, whether a fine watch, a great cigar cutter, a high end precision knife. I believe the smartest, best way to place a value on something, isn&#x27;t usually it&#x27;s initial purchase price, but rather it&#x27;s long tern investment qualities. Usually the wisest purchase, isn&#x27;t always the cheapest up front, but putting ones money into a purchase that not only will no only give you a high degree of user satisfaction, but one that will - by nature of it&#x27;s longer useful life, pay off still, as truly the best value in the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love a finely made - machined,beautifully finished , chromed, \\&quot;solid\\&quot; feeling product, it just brings so much more user satisfaction into play, than using a product of \\&quot; lesser \\&quot; quality. I did a lot of research into this item. Let me tell you, what others say about the quality  beauty, and \\&quot; feel \\&quot; in bowed by the solid weight and construction of this item, is highly satisfying. You can FEEL the quality with your eyes, before you even pick it up....The box it comes in, is beautiful, - \\&quot; Quality \\&quot; - like a very high end cologne...You just know before opening the box, that you will find an impressive item, when you open the box...Boxes - usually don&#x27;t impress me - just the wrapping or packing for holding the item inside. However - this box does impress...If you were to give this item as a gift, once the recipient , tore off say the wrapping on, then saw the box inside, they would immediate be impressed, that the giver had given them something truly out of the ordinary....And they would be right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially \\&quot; assembling the three pieces of the product together, handle, razor holder, and head, are intuitive, doing so, only part of the initial experience. The fit, finishing, machining, and solidfeel of the solid chrome, plated brass handle, are one that is truly impressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first. ownership and use of a classic single bladed cartridge, and I ham highly impressed. I have taken to this new concept, rather well. Unlike others, I have used it for over a month, and have yet to cut myself, in the slightest. Just hold the handle, so that the blade is almost completely perpendicular to your face- not 90 degrees, but perhaps - 80 degrees...  Picture almost -scraping off your stubble, than cutting it. Also, unlike other, I just use canned shave cream, quality stuff though - the Noxzema with Aloe and Lanolin. Make sure your face is warm and wet, put the cream on, SCRAPE it off with the razor. Hint, for a closer shave, you will - in my experience, need to do a 2nd upward pass with the razor, against the grain of your beard. To do this, I would strongly recommend, putting a 2nd light layer of shaving cream on your face first, to avoid cutting yourself, and for the closest of shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I would have a quibble with, is the razor blade that comes with the unit. Like others, I have found the \\&quot; Feather \\&quot; brand of replacement blades to be FAR superior. I purchased a 30 pack for something like ten dollars. They are noticeably sharper....Otherwise - I couldn&#x27;t be happier...Two concepts - Impressive Quality, and an enormously good \\&quot; Long term value, just come to mind again and again.</li>
    <li> UPDATE- April 2011: I am still using this razor, I have dropped it many times, thrown it in my luggage for out of town trips and gone through 2 or 3 beards with it and it still looks brand new.    I bought this razor because I was tired of throwing away disposable razors after only a few uses, some cheaper blades only lasting HALF A SHAVE! I have very course hair at 26, and I knew it would only get worse, those cheapy disposables might be okay for teenagers and college kids but I needed a new way to shave. Based on the combination of reviews on [...] and what was available on amazon prime for next day shipping, I settled on this safety razor.     I couldn&#x27;t be happier! The razor is beautiful- ornate and shiny, better than I expected for the price. The De89lbl has all metal parts (3 parts to be exact, and they seem to be chrome plated. After a few weeks of use the razor still looks brand new and I am still using the original blade!    The handle does not feel cheap and flimsy and the weight of it is fantastic once you get used to it. I cut myself once on the first shave, but that was because I am so accustomed to jamming a blade against my face to get a &#x27;close&#x27; shave. With a 3 day beard I now only need one pass to look shaven, and 2 if I really want to impress my wife with soft, smooth skin. I&#x27;ve gone from using 3 blades a week (at $2 a blade) in a Mach3 to using 1 blade a month (at $0.40 a blade) in my edwin jagger.    This is a great blade for beginners (I had never once used anything but a disposable) and it has already payed for itself in one month of not buying disposables in bulk from costco! This is a no-brainer, buy it now! You&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
    <li> But I do love the BOSTONIAN for the cool factor.&lt;br /&gt;The EJ cuts as good as a more expensive razor. It is a nice mild cutter&lt;br /&gt;Tom</li>
    <li> I have only had this razor for about a week, my first DE safety razor since I can&#x27;t recall, but so far I am extremely pleased.  I purchased an assortment pack of blades to go along with the Derby blades that came with it, and STRONGLY recommend everyone do likewise if you&#x27;re not already a DE razor user.  So far I have tried the Derby and Shark blades with no complaints; amazing how easy it is when you remember NOT TO PRESS, let the razor do the work!  I expect anyone using/trying a safety razor will already be using a shaving soap/cream and brush (I&#x27;ve been doing that since 1970), but also purchase an alum block (also using since 1970), more of an investment than expense, since one can last a couple of years, you will thank me.  This is a beautiful razor, well constructed, moderately aggressive, which with the right blade for your skin/beard, could be right for many men. Negatives: handle would benefit from 1/2\\&quot; or more in length, also handle would be less slippery with a crosshatch pattern (although I shave in the shower which is sort of a worst case scenario, but I make sure to rinse so there is no soap on the handle or my hand).  I would still buy this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7/21/12&gt; After using this razor for three months I&#x27;m loving it more every week.  Not only does it shave great, it LOOKS great.  Try it with Feather blades - outstanding combination.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve spent the last six months learning how to make shaving less of a chore.  My first step was using a high quality shaving cream, a shaving brush, and a good moisturizer.  While researching these items, I read more and more about the advantages of DE (Double Edge) safety razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to buy one and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my choice.  I almost went with the German made Merkur Heavy Duty (34c) razor, which seems to be the most commonly recommended DE for a new safety-razor-shaver.  I&#x27;m glad I continued to investigate razors (the Badger and Blade internet  forum is a fantastic resource) because the English made Edwin Jagger De89 is considered, by many, to be superior to the Merkur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, its appearance; it may be the brightest, shiniest thing I own.  It&#x27;s chroming is deep, flawless, and bright.  The chroming method used is the same used by Rolls Royce for its chrome accents.  The Edwin Jagger De89 comes with either a vertically lined handle, or a smooth handle.  I went with the lined as I thought it might provide a little extra traction with wet hands.  The razor arrived in a nice, blue, textured presentation box (however, the box did get a little crushed during shipping.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor itself is an absolute joy to use.  As stated in many reviews, the balance and weight is absolutely perfect.  The handle is a little longer than the Merkur HD, which is good for me (I have large hands).  After watching a few instructional youtube videos regarding proper angle and razor use, I gave it a try.  It was unlike any shave I&#x27;ve ever had before (it&#x27;s been all cartridge or disposable razors in my past).  The solid weight of the razor against my face just felt... better.  It also heats up as you rinse it and retains that heat, which felt great against my skin.  After just a few, careful shaves, I already felt very confident with the use of the razor.  The shaves are wonderfully close (as good as any I&#x27;ve ever had), and the little red bumps on my lower neck that I always assumed I&#x27;d have forever have begun to fade (believe it or not, a DE razor is much kinder to your face).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for blades, I recommend ordering a sample pack, as different blades act and react differently with every face.  It&#x27;s just another customizable aspect of DE Shaving.  Even if you decide to change your blade after three or four shaves (as many do) you will still find it cheaper than cartridge razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  It&#x27;s been a few months, and now that I have a good deal more experience I thought I&#x27;d post an update.  I now have seven or eight razors, including Merkurs, vintage-Gillettes, and some vintage single-edge Gems - and the Edwin Jagger is STILL my favorite razor.  The shaves are amazingly smooth, and while not as \\&quot;aggressive\\&quot; as some of my other razors, it gives just as close a shave.  When I finally got a Merkur I was very disappointed in its finish.  Merkurs are the most popular new DE razors sold, and I guess I was expecting more.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, they&#x27;re fine razors, but they come with little scratches and tool marks that slightly mar the finish.  The Edwin Jagger, with its perfect plating and great shaving-characteristics just makes me happy every time I pick it up.umps on my lower neck that I always assumed I&#x27;d have forever have begun to fade (believe it or not, a DE razor is much kinder to your face).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for blades, I recommend ordering a sample pack, as different blades act and react differently with every face.

    <li> I love this razor. Matched with a Feather blade it is the best shave I&#x27;ve had in my entire adult life.</li>
    <li> After purchased and used this razor I can never see myself using the 3 blade or 5 blade or any other multi blade razor ever again.</li>
    <li> Handle is a little shorter than I&#x27;d like but other it is perfect!</li>
    <li> Outstanding razor.  I own several different razors with different heads and numerous straight razors also.  This is definitely one of my go to razors.  It&#x27;s build quality is first class and looks gorgeous sitting in a matching chrome stand.</li>
    <li> My Edwin Jagger Safety razor and Derby blades showed up in perfect condition and the Derby blades were in its&#x27; shrink wrap like it should have been. This razor is nice looking, has a decent weight to it and the single blade does indeed provide for a smoother shave than either my Norelco or Gillette Mach 3&#x27;s or any other off the shelf cheap razors &amp; blades you could pick up just about anywhere.  I would have to agree with other reviewer&#x27;s in that it does take more skill to figure out the proper angle and amount of pressure to insure 1. Minimal cuts, and 2. A smooth shave. I accidentally cut myself the first time all over my face, the second time I only had 2 cuts. I can go up-to 2 or 3 days without needing to shave, before it was everyday with the other so-called razors.  It does take me a lot longer to shave though, but I would rather put in double or even triple the time in exchange for being able to run my hands over my smooth face. I don&#x27;t have a clue about stubble type, face type etc. but my Norelco etc. always left a decent amount of five o&#x27;clock shadow: on a scale of 1 - 10 with 10 being the worst, it would have been about an 8. Using the Edwin Jagger &amp; Derby blade brought the five o&#x27;clock shadow down to a 5 maybe even a 4, but the gray shadow is still visible. I would probably have to agree with those who say this is the closest thing to a straight blade, only because I&#x27;ve never tried or had a straight blade shave, but have tried many cheaper plastic mainstream electronic shavers &amp; razors and they simply can&#x27;t stand up to this 1950&#x27;s throwback by Edwin Jagger. I will experiment with other type of blades other than Derby as I&#x27;ve read that the blade can also make a difference.  I already pre-bought a Edwin Jagger badger brush and the Edwin Jagger shaving cream, but not from Amazon.com, but I would highly recommend these as well, they do help and a little shaving cream lasts long and goes a long ways.ght razor and leather strop because I need to use a new razor for the Edwin Jagger each time I shave. I use side 1 for one day then side 2 the next and then throw the entire razor away to use another because it will not shave close thereafter (I&#x27;ve purchased nearly every brand of replacement blades); as a result, I decided to buy the Dovo straight razor to save money from purchasing thin shaving replaceable blades. Also, my Norelco electric shaver worked especially well when shaving in circles as the directions suggested, but it caused tremendous razor bumps the following two days even when using face oil and shaving creams.</li>
    <li> This was my first DE razor and I love it. I watched a lot of YouTube videos and this, along with the merkur products, seemed like a good buy. I am a big guy and I work out, but I still amazed at how heavy this razor is for it&#x27;s size. It definitely isn&#x27;t to heavy to use but it very much surprised me coming from the &amp;#34;lighter then air,&amp;#34; fusion 5 blade razor handles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I think this 3 piece design is a bit more difficult to clean compared to the merkur 2 piece &amp;#34;butterfly,&amp;#34; design but it is by no means hard. I think I&#x27;ll get sick of the razor and buy a new DE razor before this one needs replaced. It is a quality product.</li>
    <li> The quality of this item doesn&#x27;t come into question. The chrome plating is top notch, and it&#x27;s got a nice heft to it.     Why only two stars then? The design is HORRENDOUS. The handle is a mere three inches long. Even for not so large hands like mine, it&#x27;s a pain to hold comfortably, and requires an arthritis inducing grip.     What&#x27;s worse, instead of a decent grip pattern embedded into the handle to make it easy to hold while wet, the handle only has vertical ridges in it.     It won&#x27;t twist in your hand, but if you don&#x27;t keep a vise-tight grip on it, it will slide up and down while you&#x27;re shaving, leading to an aching hand or nicks and cuts... or both.     Worse still, instead of the classic butterfly style opening to replace the blade, the entire head comes off and has to be opened to remove and insert blades. Sooner or later, you&#x27;re going to end up slicing your fingers trying to replace a blade.     And keep in mind, a safety razor cuts with a shallower angle than modern cartridge razor blades.You can&#x27;t get away with the shave-and-dash with a safety razor, the way you might with a multi-blade cartridge razor.  You&#x27;ll want to use some sort of oil/cream base on your beard before lathering up, to help the blade glide, and definitely a moisturizing aftershave to help with all the scraped skin when you&#x27;re done.     If you&#x27;re going to go with an old fashioned safety razor, I would recommend trying this one: [[ASIN:B003NTHWLU Parker 99R Butterfly Open Double Edge Safety Razor &amp; 10 Shark Super Chrome Blades - Heavyweight + Long Handle!]] Long handle, textured grip, and an easy open butterfly head. Everything I wish I&#x27;d gotten with this razor.</li>
    <li> I bought this through Amazon Fresh and this is my first safety razor. I don&#x27;t know why the Amazon Verified Purchase thing does not pop up, and I do not know how to write the review on Amazon Fresh. Bummer!  I was becoming frustrated using disposable razors, always having to spend on new cartridges and thinking the whole time that it was not economical, so decided to make the switch to a safety razor, and I do not regret it. It is simple to use, cuts more close than a throw away and is cheaper in the long run. I recommend this to anyone who is tired of always paying a lot for blades or cartridges.</li>
    <li> Just got this razor and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it. It&#x27;s extremely well made, and beautiful to look at. Comes with a few blades to get you started, which is nice. The angle and shape are just right for getting a close, but still smooth shave.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Edwin Jagger De89lbl from Amazon and as always for me got fast shipping like 2 days. The item itself is really nice with no flaws anywhere and is very shiny with perfect/flawless chrome plating. The display box it came with is a classy black box. Its almost too nice looking to use but of course i bought it for shaving. Shaving is really nice with this razor. I believe it was designed to shave the best at a certain angle. This angle is not parallel to your face but is like this... make sure the head of the razor is perpendicular and touching your face and then roll the razors head down until its about 60 to 75 degrees and then start the shave. For me this angle seems to shave the best. I am using a van der hagen boar brush and soap and this seems to work fine for me. Maybe i will get fancier soap and brush later. When i walk through the isles of a wholesaler that have 15 packs of multi bladed razors for $ 45.00 i laugh knowing that i am saving so much money with just the same or better shaves. I get really close shaves with this and is even better when you use the correct brush and soap regimen. Face is really smooth and unlike alot of others have no cuts whatsoever, although i will say that i am the careful type that take my time. I actually get less cuts compared to the el cheapo plastic throw-aways but i think part of this is because i am more careful. Alot of the nicks/cuts complaints i think are due to careless shaving. Some may even be the multi head shaving corps trying to give these razors a bad reputation but i dont think a ceo would waste their time doing this but maybe they told a subordinate to do so :) Who knows. If these razors start to catch on more then the big guys would get worried.. maybe they already have. By the way the derby razor that came with it were OK to get started but i think a pack of $ 1.79 razor blade bought at the discount store work better.</li>
    <li> Ok, so I finally got tired of spending lots and lots of money for gimmicky razors. You know, the 3,4,5, or even 6 blade stuff that costs a fortune to replace. My father had given me his Gillette butterfly DE safety razor, and I became hooked on wet shaving. I found that the Gillette was too agressive, and since I had coarse, heavy stubble, I nicked myself more than a few times with the Gillette. I debated for several days on whether to buy the Edwin Jagger or the Merkur since both had great reviews. I settled for the Jagger and I could not be happier with my choice. A package of Derby blades came with the razor and that&#x27;s what I have stuck with so far. However, I do plan on getting a variety package of blades in order to fine tune the razor.&lt;br /&gt;  First glance out the box, the razor is shiny, slick, and heavy. It feels like a real mans razor. There is no plastic on this bad-boy. Dare I say that it looks &#x27;sexy&#x27;? I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out. I let my stubble grow for 2 days and proceeded. I started with Shave Secret oil followed by shave soap. The Jagger is not as aggressive as the Gillette, so it took a bit to learn the correct angle with this razor. I will say that I do have a somewhat sensitive face and after the Gillette I looked sunburnt. With the Jagger, I can make multiple passes of it with the grain, against the grain, and across the grain without hacking up or skinning my face. Overall I am well pleased with this razor. There has been no problems so far and the finish of the razor is extraordinary. I am an Edwin Jagger fan now!</li>
    <li> Worked well for two years, then the screw wore out.  I changed the blade about once a week, so it lasted for approximately 100 blades.</li>
    <li> Ditch the expensive cartridge blades pushed by the companies and go back to a safety razor.  A typical blade last me 3 weeks and I bought 100 blades for $12, that will last me 5 and 3/4 years as opposed to $28 worth of blades that last 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a well built, solid razor that will last a life time.  I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Too big &amp; bulky.  Can&#x27;t seem to get to all of the beard.  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> Well-made. easy to use. good weight..Great as a first raiser for those getting back into safety razors.</li>
    <li> Excellent!  Would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> Wow, this is quality.  The best shave yet, should have bought this first.</li>
    <li> Awesome razor. I just started using a DE razor and have not had as many cuts as expect after making the transition to this razor.</li>
    <li> This razor is quite simply the best razor I have ever owned, smooth, cuts close without being aggressive, just a fantastic grooming tool.</li>
    <li> I love this razor. I start out using Gillette safety razors. Then you couldn&#x27;t fine the razors or the blades. I like the Edwin Jagger better that the Gillette safey razor. Every young man should start using them.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try using a safety razor, so I started out on the cheap with this one:    [[ASIN:B001VD7VIY Double Edge Razor LORD Chrome ---GREAT VALUE---]]    It is an absolutely decent razor, but in the end you get what you pay for. This razor far outshines the cheap one. After reading up online a bit I couldn&#x27;t really pinpoint the difference but now that I&#x27;ve tried them both I&#x27;d like to try and describe it. Lots of people mention that this is a nice heavy razor. The weight of this razor is nice, it feels more solidly built. I don&#x27;t know if that is what really gave me a better shave, though.     I think the angle at which this razor holds the blade is much nicer than the cheap razor. The head essentially bends the blade slightly downward, which gives you a better shaving angle, a smoother shave, and also seems to be better on blade wear. The cheaper razor doesn&#x27;t have quite as steep an angle, which made it a bit tougher on my face and I seemed to go through blades more quickly.     All in all, I am glad I spent the money on this razor. It provides a really nice smooth shave that has me hooked. The cheap razor will serve nicely as a backup or a travel razor, but this one deserves to be used every day.</li>
    <li> This is my first DE razor, and I am quite impressed. The razor has an excellent weight, and seems very high quality (in terms of fit and finish). The shave itself is excellent. I was surprised at how good my first shave with it was, yesterday, because of how many people I had read about (online) who talked about their first shave being one of pain. In reality, I had a very nice and very close shave with one small nick. I think this is both the result of a very finely modeled razor (to wit, the EJ 89lbl) and the very fine blades that came with it. I look forward to receiving my sampler pack of blades in the mail today (this one:[[ASIN:B002Z85VJK 40 FEATHER BlueBird KAI GILLETTE ASTRA SHARK LORD DERBY Sampler Blades]]) in order to see if I can get an even better shave than I did with the Derby blades it came with.     In short, this is an excellent first DE razor, and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> threaded screw top broke off after only 10 months of normal use and it is now useless and not eligible for replacement.  I got burned on this purchase.  Product description implied that it was a good quality item because it was not made in China.  Do not waste your money on this, not worth it.  For almost 40 bucks I expect better quality.</li>
    <li> Gread introductory razor for those new to shaving with a safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good balance and weight, and absolutely beautiful chrome design and finish.</li>
    <li> This is a nice razor, especially for those just starting out with DE shaving. Its lighter and less aggressive than my Merkur Futur but gives an excellent close shave for me with Derby blades. Nicely chromed. Forget those cartridge razors, learn to properly use a DE and you will never regret it.</li>
    <li> Update!!  I have been using this razor for about eight months now and I really love it.  I hardly ever use my other razors anymore.  I bought a blade sampler pack and have been trying new blades each week.  The razor works well with all blades, (Blade quality does vary but thats a different review) and soaps including canned shaving cream.  The balance is good, the razor is square and true so the same amount of blade is exposed on both sides and evenly exposed on both sides.  The chrome plating is still mirror bright with now signs of wear or flaking.  As long as I pay attention and don&#x27;t rush I get a great shave.  I highly recommend this razor.    Initial Review.  Excellent product.  I have been wet shaving for a year and can&#x27;t believe how much better and more comfortable shaving is since I ditched those multi-blade cartridges.  My first razors were Parker TTO styles, and I got an excellent shave with both of them.  I saw a review of the Edwin Jagger DE 89LBL on another site and decided to try it.  Excellent quality product, the razor is well balanced, the chrome plating is even and mirror bright.  I have used the razor with generic drug store blades and Colonel Conks soap with excellent results.  Smooth, clean shave every time.  The razor makes it easy to achieve the correct angle and the balance makes it easy to shave without pressing the blade against your face.  I intend to try this razor with other blades and soap combinations.  I&#x27;ll update my review in a few months.</li>
    <li> The chrome finish on this razor is spectacular, the shave is smooth, and the heft and balance in hand is very comfortable.    This was my first purchase of a DE razor (though I&#x27;m sure not my last - I&#x27;m hooked).  If you&#x27;ve never shaved with a DE razor, I highly recommend the DE89 as a go-to razor. The craftsmanship is very solid, and I&#x27;m sure this razor will outlast me.  Very nice product.</li>
    <li> Did not believe the ad when it said will shave close as a straight razor.  Hey, you can believe it.  I do not have the words to tell you how close the  shave is.  I junked all 4 of my electric shavers and my old stand by blade shaver,  which I have been using for over 40 years.  The Edwin Jagger double edge razor is the best you will ever buy........go for it!!</li>
    <li> I got my razor last night and was excited. I have a Merkur and LOVE it, but needed something portable too.  I have a leather travel case for the other but if I decide to leave the blade in the case won&#x27;t last too long.  Well the good thing about the removable head on this razor is after it dries you can flip the bottom guard around and the razor sits flush on that piece so it can be transported.  The bad part of that is when the razor came that piece was already upside down... so when I want to shave I&#x27;m like WTF? How&#x27;s this supposed to work?! There... Ohhhhhh... I&#x27;m blonde. :)  Long story short it does a great job and was a third the cost of my cheaper Merkur.  Get one and save money and the environment.  Take it slow if you are new and you&#x27;ll do just fine.  Mike</li>
    <li> It seems like most of the positive, glowing reviews are about the glowing chrome on this thing.  It&#x27;s an ok shave.  The lower plate, below the razor&#x27;s edge, is at a sharp angle and this is different than the Gillettes which have rounded lower plates.  After reading reviews and watching some youtube videos, I really wanted to like this razor but I think the Gillettes might actually produce a smoother shave.  By that I mean the action of the razor, not smoothness of skin, which is more dependent on blade quality and whether you shave a second time against the grain.  The biggest difference with this one is that most of the weight is in the handle where Gillettes have most of their weight in the razor&#x27;s head.  I&#x27;ve used a Trac II for 25 years and decided to try two saftey razors, one Gillette and this shiny Edwin Jagger and while they&#x27;re pretty close in shave, an adjustable Gillette with the rounded lower plate might produce a smoother shave for alot of people.  I guess I&#x27;m saying - don&#x27;t let the chrome fool ya.  Get the one that works for you.  This chrome razor is more like a piece of jewelry, to be handed down and gawked at generations from now.  But it will shave you without any problem.</li>
    <li> I was tired of the overpriced multi-blade disposable razors out on the market.  After reading many reviews, I choose this over the similar razors made by Merkur and Parker.  It took about 2 weeks to get the perfect shave by finding the right shave angle and using little to no pressure.  The chrome is nice and shiny yet it is not slippery when held.  I&#x27;m not grabbing the razor with shaving soap or cream on my hands.  I do rinse my hands before I start shaving but my hands don&#x27;t need to be dry.  My wet hands have no problems holding this razor while I shave and it has never slipped out of my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I would easily recommend this razor to anyone new to DE shaving and those just wanting to save some money on razor blades.  Blades cost under 20 cents each for me and I change them once a week but could probably go longer between changes.  The perfect setup for me was a badger hair brush (~$15 Escali from Amazon), Deluxe Shave Soap (~$2 Walmart), Wilkinson Sword Blades (~$2 for 10 Walmart).  I would also recommend a styptic Stick (~$1) to stop any nicks after shaving and this came in handy my first few weeks of wet shaving when I had a few nicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;m glad I bought this razor and would recommended it to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE(11/20/12): Had first baby and was exhausted shaving in the shower and dropped it breaking off the head from the body and breaking the screw.  It was my favorite razor in my collection and would still recommend it.  Now using a vintage gillette but missing my Edwin Jagger!</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for about a year now and am very satisfied.  Finding blades in the US is sometimes an issue but a fun one to resolve :)</li>
    <li> Broke when dropped on the sink not from very high. Otherwise, I was happy with it.</li>
    <li> Excellent razor, easy to get a good shave, very forgiving.  Highly recommended for beginners to wet-shaving.</li>
    <li> The razor cut my skin..very rough shave</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been meaning to give a safety razor a try, hadn&#x27;t used one since the 1970&#x27;s, so when this one was on sale I took the plunge.  I&#x27;ve been using the Derby blades (bought 100 for $9) though I&#x27;m going to try the other (looking at you, Feather!) brands too.  The razor is a nice heavy hunk of metal.  Very little pressure is required compared with a plastic disposable.  You just glide it down your face and let the razor do the work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was a bit of a learning curve to get the right angle on the blade versus face.  I found that a forgiving angle is best, you don&#x27;t want to use it like a hacksaw.  Trust in the razor to lift the whiskers and cut them off.  Don&#x27;t hold the perpendicular to your face, you have to angle it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a pretty heavy beard and for me the problem area is the chin.  I did cut myself in the chin area a few times but the cuts didn&#x27;t bleed much.  I&#x27;ve found that on the chin I have to go against the grain after going with the grain to get a close enough shave.  Other than the chin I am okay with going over the area once with the grain. The only other problem area is the Adam&#x27;s apple, I&#x27;ve learned to be very cautious in that area.  It sticks out so it is naturally going to get nicked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Derby blades are so cheap that I&#x27;ve been changing them pretty frequently even if I could get a few more shaves out of them, I&#x27;m okay with spending 13 cents a week on blades.  All in all it took me three weeks to get a nick-free shave that was as close as the shave I got with the disposable razor I have been using for the last few years, but now I&#x27;ve got a lifetime of spending next to nothing on razors.  I&#x27;m looking forward to trying out the Feather blades.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor, and liked the shave it provided, but the product is of fairly low manufacturing quality.  I dropped it once from about a foot, and the head broke off.  With the quality and quantity of products out there, I&#x27;d avoid this one and go for one that is of built to last.</li>
    <li> With just a little practice this razor shaves as close as a straight razor. Let the weight of the razor head do the work. After 3 shaves I had no cuts, no nicks and no razor burn. I use a coconut oil cream as a pre conditioner then my regular shaving gel. With this I get the best shave of my life! You can&#x27;t go wrong with a Edwin Jagger!</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research and reading of all reviews before deciding to order this razor. Almost all talked about the fantastic chrome finish, weight, etc. of this razor. Some questioned why this would be important, I&#x27;ll explain my opinion on this matter: The excellent finish of this razor simply makes for a much smoother shave since it glides so effortlessly across the face! My old Gillette gull-wing is over 40 years old and although I&#x27;ll keep it (sentimental, I guess as it was passed down to me) it will be a rare occasion to use it again. My old Gillette just doesn&#x27;t glide over my face as smoothly as it seemed to before. I truly enjoy picking up my Edwin Jagger DE89 every day now, it is such a pleasure (if there is such a thing in shaving) to use every time. The EJ is of good heft and requires very little pressure to obtain a close shave, since little pressure is required to shave, and the finsih is so good I have very little issue with razor burn anymore and the blade edges are not too aggressive. I really like this razor and have suggested it to family members. Another thought, what is wrong with a little \\&quot;bling\\&quot; with a purpose sitting on the bathroom counter?!?! I also purchased the hundred pack blade assortment, one pack good, one not so but functional, more review on the blades specifically when I get further along with the different blades. I am also sure of another thing, as long as double edge blades are made for this razor, I will never again pay the ridiculous price for multiple blade cartridge blades!!</li>
    <li> Nice and simple.  Three pieces of chrome that perfectly shape a fine blade of stainless steel into a beard killing machine.  It feels perfectly balanced and yet has substantial heft at the same time - enabling effortless strokes shearing stubble like Death&#x27;s deadly scythe shears heads (say that 5 times, fast).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, baby soft skin awaits.  You don&#x27;t really even need to play the \\&quot;enthusiast retro-shaver\\&quot; game.  Use whatever safety blade you wish.  You can even continue using standard shave cream like Gillette - you don&#x27;t have to use a brush to whip your own lather.  Sure, it&#x27;s fun to do it that way. Sure, it rinses easier off the blade, but your favorite aloe gel works too and it is much more efficient time-wise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and don&#x27;t be scared off by all the horror stories of nicks and cuts.  If you can shave with a regular Bic you can handle a double-edge safety razor.  The Jagger sets the angle of the blade perfectly.</li>
    <li> I have nothing but good things to say about the De89.  I&#x27;ve owned this for more than a year, for the record.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) After 1 year, no problems with the chrome plating chipping or anything, still looks like new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Gives a great close shave, not like anything else I&#x27;ve had before&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Handle is nice and long for my big hands.  The &#x27;ribbed&#x27; handle is probably the way to go. Looks better in my opinion than the &#x27;flat&#x27; surface you can also get, and also gives a decent grip even when you inevitably get shaving cream on your hands&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: None that I have found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get the full use of your razor, whatever you choose - please get an excellent shaving soap.  This makes all the difference in getting best shave you can get.  The best I&#x27;ve found is &amp;#34;mitchell&#x27;s wool fat shaving soap&#x27; - buy it here on amazon if you wish.  Tabac is also very very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I&#x27;ve found that I like Feather brand blades the best.  The razor itself came with a set of derby&#x27;s - not bad as a starter.</li>
    <li> The feedback from the user is 2 thumbs way up!! He loves the close shave and the feel and heft of a real metal razor.  As I wrapped it, I noticed it is finely constructed..beautiful!</li>
    <li> I got this razor in mid-May as an early Father&#x27;s Day gift (I was too impatient to wait &#x27;til June). I have used it at least twice a week since then. My previous razors have been the Gillette Mach 3 and Fusion, so that is my basis of comparison.    First, let me tell you that this does NOT shave any closer or more comfortably than the Gillette razors...at least not in my experience. I will say it shaves about as close as the Gillettes, but not closer. You can also expect to spend about 10-12 minutes shaving, so you aren&#x27;t saving any time.     There is a steep learning curve with a double edge safety razor. The first several times you use it you will probably regret buying it. My first shave was close, but since I didn&#x27;t have the technique mastered I cut my self in no less than 15 places. The water I rinsed my face with was a nice pink shade from all the blood it was washing off! While it got better, it took me about 4 or 5 weeks of uncomfortable shaves before I figured it out. I have since learned that you need to put ABSOLUTELY NO PRESSURE ON THE RAZOR! Simply hold it against your face and let its weight guide it as it falls down the surface of your face. Moral of the story: don&#x27;t get discouraged at first.    The reason the shave takes about 10-12 minutes is because you really need to shave three times to get the job done correctly. My first pass is with the grain. The second pass is across the grain. The third pass is against the grain at about a 45 degree angle (not directly against the grain). After that I do small touch up work, mostly under my chin and around my adams apple. There are numerous videos on YouTube showing how to shave with one of these.    Even though it takes a while to shave and it isn&#x27;t any more comfortable than the Gillette razors, I absolutely love this razor...now that I know how to use it. There&#x27;s a certain nostalgic feel to it and for the first time in years I actually look forward to shaving. It makes me feel more like a man. I also have much less skin irritation afterwards. When I was shaving with a Gillette I would usually have several white heads on my chin the next day. I haven&#x27;t had a single one since I started using this razor (even when I was hacking up my face). Also, the area at the top of my neck remains a normal skin tone, rather than that irritated reddish skin tone.    I&#x27;m also surprised at how long one blade lasts. I&#x27;m on blade #3 of the original pack of 5 that came with it, and I&#x27;ve been using this razor for just over two months. Where I was spending around $50/year on blade replacements for the Gillette, I should be spending about $5 a year on replacement blades for this razor.    If you have the patience to figure this thing out and don&#x27;t mind spending a little more time shaving, then I would definitely recommend getting one. Otherwise you&#x27;re better off sticking with the Gillette or Schick.</li>
    <li> after using this razor for several months I think its great. Not very aggressive but very easy (safe) to use and great looking in the bathroom</li>
    <li> I did a bit of research and this razor was the best bang for the buck. After my first use I was hooked, I nearly get 8-10 shaves from a single blade. I used to have to go over my face multiples of times with a 4-5 bladed razor, but this thing is amazing. With 1-2 swipes I can be smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt and no irritation or razor burn. Some people say the handles to short, but I prefer it even being 6&#x27;3\\&quot; and 220 with bear claws. Buy one now and you will never look back on the competitors.</li>
    <li> I just tested my new razor, and I must say that this was the most pleasant shave I have ever had.  I decided to make this purchase after always dreading spending so much money on and using disposable cartridge razors which I never found pleasant to shave with.  The single, double edged blade glides through hair with almost no effort, and cleaning and replacing the razor couldn&#x27;t be simpler.  I suppose if I had to add one critique, it would be that this razor is a little smaller than I have always been used to, but this certainly isn&#x27;t cause to lower the 5 stars that this product deserves.  UPDATE 3/9/2015: Sadly, my Edwin Jagger DE razor broke in two today after I finished shaving.  When I set it down in its razor stand, the razor did not sit properly in the stand and fell a very short distance on the counter, breaking the head off.  I am disappointed in how brittle this razor was, seeing as Edwin Jagger is known for making high quality products (or so I thought.)  Hopefully, I will be able to receive a replacement.  If not, I will likely make the switch to a Merkur razor.</li>
    <li> Very nice and my only complaint is it&#x27;s very short handle. If you have large hands like me you may want to shop around for a longer handle. Other than that the craftsmanship is excellent and I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful razor. It comes with a starter set of blades. The chrome is FLAWLESS. I debated between this and a couple other safety razors and I&#x27;m absolutely thrilled with my choice</li>
    <li> Great quality, a razor for a lifetime.</li>
    <li> My first double edge razor thought I would cut up my face. I was surprised that it didn&#x27;t and take less pressure to my face to shave. Seems much better than the through away kind.</li>
    <li> Incredible shave. Non aggressive. Do wish the handle was longer, though.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor. It is nicely chromed. The head is finished perfectly so the Blade sits tightly and straight. The chrome is evenly distributed so the head of the razor will glide across the skin easily and evenly. It has the perfect weight distribution between handle and head for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con with this razor is that the corners of the razor head are slightly sharp, so when shaving concave areas like the neck it can feel like you are being scratched by the sharp corners. You can quickly learn to avoid this though, so it should not be a reason to avoid this razor. I think if Edwin Jagger would round the corners on the head slightly it would be the perfect razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had rough hair on my face, and I&#x27;ve always had difficulty with getting a close shave. I had read about DE shaving for a while, and I finally decided to try it out. If you&#x27;re looking for the best razor, I would suggest this one. It&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve tried, but it also tends to get the highest reviews on shaving sites, or at the very least is even with the Merkur. Some guys seem to naturally get smooth faces every time they shave, and it looks like they don&#x27;t grow any hair. Men like me must have more testosterone, because my hair refuses to go without a fight, and it always grows back quickly with a vengeance. I just couldn&#x27;t get a smooth shave with my Mach 3, but everything changed when I got my Edwin Jagger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor itself is very pretty. The pictures don&#x27;t do it justice. If you&#x27;ve never used one before it&#x27;s a little confusing how to put the blade in when you first pick this up, but once you realize that the top two pieces screw off, it&#x27;s as simple as it can get. It&#x27;s not at all difficult to hold the razor or to use it, the only difficulty is getting the angle right when drawing down along your face. Even this isn&#x27;t especially hard to figure out though, and after a few shaves you&#x27;ll have it down. The blade moves very easily across my face, and it never tugs on me like cartridge blades do. I&#x27;ve tried two blade brands so far: Derby and Wilkinson. Derby is much less aggressive and is very easy to start with. These blades come with the razor in a pack of five. I bought some Wilkinson blades, and they&#x27;re actually quite nice, but far more sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should note that you do not apply pressure when shaving with DE razors. Doing so will only get you cut. This takes some practice to get used to, but you&#x27;ll learn quickly. The best way to get a close shave is by first going with the grain, then across it, and then lightly against it. It&#x27;s also important to get some shaving soap and a brush. It lathers up very nicely, and can make a big difference in how smoothly the blade cuts. It is also important to unscrew the razor and dry it off after shaving. This will keep your razor clean and make it last indefinitely. I usually dry mine off and then let it sit on a towel to get rid of any residual moisture. It still looks like the day I got it, so I must be doing something right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently grew my beard for about a month and a half, and had more hair on my face than ever. I shaved using my Edwin Jagger with a Wilkinson blade, and had no tug or pull. The hair came off quickly. Oddly enough, going from the most hair I&#x27;d ever had I ended up with the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had. Four and a half days later and my fast growing facial hair looks like it&#x27;s just a day or two after using a cartridge razor. One of the best parts about using DE razors is the price of blades. They&#x27;re incredibly cheap, especially in bulk. Cartridge razors dulled pretty fast for me, and using a weak blade would just irritate my face. These blades not only last longer, but they&#x27;re so cheap you can toss them out after every shave if you feel like it. (You won&#x27;t need to, especially for quick daily shaves, but it&#x27;s nice to have the option to switch out whenever you want.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely satisfied with this razor, and if you&#x27;re looking for one to buy, go with this one. It gets great reviews, and I have nothing negative to say about it. It&#x27;s everything I hoped it would be. It feels manly and professional, has very cheap blades, is easy to handle, and is incredibly easy to dry out and take care of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Razor itself is perfect, no issues at all, probably the best option currently out there for new or experienced users.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Derby blades: very cheap, very easy to use. Not as sharp as other brands, not as close of a shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wilkinson blades: still pretty cheap, much sharper and aggressive than Derbys, gets a much closer shave, a little more difficult to use</li>
    <li> been using it for 3 years now...great product.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving since i was 16 and i have used every thing from clippers,to electric, to high priced disposables. After using the Edwin Jagger i was immediately impressed. The shave was smooth, you could really tell the razor was cutting the hair. I must say though i watched many videos and read many articles about how to use a safety razor, it is very different then electric and disposables razors so i would recommend studying how to use the razor before you use this razor you could easily hurt yourself and get a bad experience. I have used the razor twice now and as far as i can tell will not being going back to electric or disposable. Simply put when used properly the closet shave i have ever had, face was very smooth, i was unable to achieve a baby smooth face until i used this razor highly recommend it. It also cost less in the long run then the Gillet fusion i was using and works a 100 times better, not exaggerating.</li>
    <li> Hubby loves it! No problem with nicks &amp; cuts with first time use.</li>
    <li> I shaved with this razor yesterday morning. This was the first time in 25 years I had shaved with a double edged razor and I still got a close shave with no nicks! Just to ensure it wasn&#x27;t a fluke, I shaved with it again that evening even though I had no pressing engagements. Smoooooooooth!!!! Shaving is now a pleasure again instead of being a necessary chore. I would highly recommend this razor, and the Derby blades it came with, thus far.</li>
    <li> This is a man&#x27;s man razor.  The blade is sharp and perfect for lining a beard, which is what I bought it for.  It shaves so smooth, and it has a very heavy feel in the hand that just feels good to hold.  I was going to buy one of the $100-150 ones, but I decided to go with a cheaper version, and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  This costs less than other versions, but it is by no means cheap.</li>
    <li> Great razor.  Highly recommended.  *edit* removed two stars because after about a year of ownership the chrome plating started peeling and scrathced my face pretty badly.</li>
    <li> After a thirty-year hiatus from using a DE safety razor, I threw out my stash of cheap disposables and purchased this gem. It&#x27;s well balanced, grips easily, and provides a nick-free shave. Though the Derby blades that come with this razor were adequate, I replaced them with Wilkinson Swords, which perform better with my beard and choice of shaving products. Overall, I highly recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> I had to finally replace my old Merkur adjustable razor. So, after reading reviews, I decided to give this one a try. I&#x27;m glad I did. I am not disappointed with this razor at all.. I never used the adjustments on my Merkur (stayed on 1) so, I wasn&#x27;t concerned about this not being adjustable. It has a nice weight and balance to it. This razor is well built and the chrome is very shiny!! Plus, I like using the Derby DE blades so, getting five of them with this razor was an added bonus for me!! If you are looking for a great DE razor, you&#x27;ll not be disappointed with this one at all!!</li>
    <li> quality item, great balance and feel</li>
    <li> Well made ,work great.</li>
    <li> Excellent DE razor for a beginner.  Well crafted.  Made in England.  Got good results shaving.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to DE shaving and won&#x27;t go back. This is a well made razor and will last me years. Great deal and quick shipping. Lots of choice in blades out there and they&#x27;re cheaper than the junk plastic razors. Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> Heft and finish are great. The acid test is how it works and it passes for me. I used the blades that came with it and got a clean shave.</li>
    <li> Based on reviews I thought it would be a good razor, but it shaved much worse than the much cheaper and even much heavier Utopia Care. Granted, it is better engineered, and the blade does center better but it is just too short, too light, and the shave is very uneven. The Utopia&#x27;s heavier handle does fit the DE89 and does improve the shave a bit, but the Utopia&#x27;s shaver head, being more rounded gives a much closer and more even shave than the DE89 (assuming you took the trouble of centering the blade properly - because the engineering is pretty poor).</li>
    <li> I had initially liked this razor thinking it was a well balanced razor.  I should have waited to review until after I had a lengthier time with the razor.  After having shaved with it for a while, I do not like it.  It is an aggressive shaver, which I was surprised by since many reviews dubbed it a medium aggressive and suitable for sensitive skin.  I never did get a very good shave, and always found the razor wasn&#x27;t consistent.  I used feather blades mostly.  The biggest issue was that although the initial quality looked to be very good, the chrome did in fact peal on the cutting head.</li>
    <li> Got the Edwin Jagger lined razor today.  Simple  Elegant  Sophisticated  A real piece of art, what shaving was meant to be!</li>
    <li> Do yourself a favor and ditch the Mach III or Fusion you&#x27;re using and break free of the Gillette and Schick chains you&#x27;re wearing. Despite all their advertising hype, old-fashioned safety razors are not at all difficult to use, and they give an even closer shave at a fraction of the price. I got tired of spending $30 every month on pricey blades. This razor is nice and heavy and feels perfectly balanced in the hand. I was afraid at first to commit to changing from mass-market razors and blades to an &amp;#34;old-fashioned&amp;#34; razor, but I shouldn&#x27;t have been. The process takes a few minutes longer, but everything about it - from the rich lather you get from cream and brush, to the super-smooth shave you get with safety razors, makes it a better experience overall. Go for it!</li>
    <li> Handle is too short, grooves provide no grip at all and I hate having to take it completely apart to clean it. Just bought a Weishei and I like it much better.</li>
    <li> No more razor burn and the closest shaves ever!  I love shaving again.I have a sensitive face and thick facial hair. it&#x27;s amazing how one single blade can outperform the mach threes I used to buy,  and at a fraction of the cost. I&#x27;m relatively new to straight razor shaving but am mastering it with every shave. A descent brush, proraso pre shave and cream and you&#x27;ll get a great shave every time.  the key is letting the razor do the work.  just let the weight of the razor be all the force you need, DONT PRESS.  just let it glide down your face  and it will take the hair right off.  try it and you&#x27;ll love it.  there are great tutorials on youtube.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with a variety of electric and bladed razors for 30 years.  Electrics pinched and grabbed and never shaved close.  The years of single-double-triple-quad-quint-bladed drugstore razors were hit-or-miss at best, nearly all of them leaving me with either ugly bumps, nicks, or burn.  For 5 years I grew an ugly full beard simply so I didn&#x27;t have to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I read an article about \\&quot;Grandpa&#x27;s razors,\\&quot; the old-fashioned safety razors I remember Grandpa using so many years ago.  I felt I had nothing to lose, and the price was not much worse that today&#x27;s crop of uber-many-bladed plastic techno wizards sold across the nation.  After a bit more reading I settled on the Edwin Jagger DE89L, and instead of driving 45 miles to the nearest shopping mall that actually sold such instruments I visited Amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow.  Not only was it In Stock, but it was way cheaper than the mall store wanted.  In two days it was in my hands and (with a bit of fear, I&#x27;ll admit) I shaved for the first time with a safety razor.  Not a cut, not a scratch, no bumps, no razor burn, no blood, no hair grabbing ... just a comfortable shave, and yes, a manly shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My next purchase, after some more studying, will be a boar or badger brush, a proper soap, and a shaving mug to round out my \\&quot;like Grandpa did\\&quot; shaving system.  Why oh why didn&#x27;t I do this 30 years ago?</li>
    <li> Best Bang for the buck safety razor..</li>
    <li> I was impressed when I took this razor out of the box. The chrome finish is outstanding. I almost didn&#x27;t want to shave with it because it looked so nice. I own many DE safety razors but if you are looking to try one for the first time I think this is the one to get because it is on the mild side.</li>
    <li> Great razor.  Says it all really.  Make the leap and stop wasting money on cartridge and disposables.  The initial outlay may seem high, but when you consider you can buy 100 blades for this bad boy for £10 it makes perfect sense.</li>
    <li> I am a new de shaver. I got a weishi to start with and quickly realized I needed to spend a little more money for something nicer.&lt;br /&gt;This is a fabulous razor and does not break the bank. Much smoother shave overall and the finish is beautiful!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;The weight is just right and flows great to allow perfect form.&lt;br /&gt;This tends to like sharper blades I find, but still.l makes the less sharp ones still work better than the weishi</li>
    <li> Beautifully made and shaves beautifully too.  I shaved for probably 15 years with some sort of Gillette twist to open safety razor then moved to electrics for another 30 or so years but always had to use a disposable to get the missed spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More for grins and giggles than anything else I decided to try wet shaving again recently - first using disposables and a Van der Hagen kit (brush, bowl, and soap) to see if I&#x27;d like it and if it was all that.  After a couple weeks I decided it was a much better experience albeit slower than the Norelco.  So off I went online to order another Gillette safety razor and found that show was over and all they did now was carts.  Not going down that road so on a couple of google and you tube searches I found the forums and videos of the brotherhood of wet shavers.  While the Merkur line has been highly reviewed and lots of guys seem to be going back to the well to find vintage safety razors (and cutthroats, yikes!) I kept hearing about Edwin Jagger and that their head was a mild to medium shave.  I knew that&#x27;s what I wanted to try.  There was also a lot of praise for their quality of manufacture and finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had it down by the second shave and really enjoy the experience of wet shaving with Edwin Jagger products (as well as VdH soap too).  I added one of their super badger brushes and a tub of Taylor of Old Bond Street sandalwood shaving cream.  Easy to lather, smells good, and seems slick enough.  Using the included Derby blades, I find the shave smooth and close.  However, I learned to question whether an ATG pass on *my* neck was a great idea.  I have a fairly light beard and my neck can get irritated if I&#x27;m not careful.  While my goal has been a BBS shave all over, I&#x27;ve settled for a DFS below the jaw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My normal routine is shower, a little hair conditioner on my beard after washing my face.  Leave it wet out of the shower.  Maybe a little pre-shave oil (I have a home brew of evoo and mineral oil) and use literally two drops.  No problem with it interfering with the lather.  I warm my lather bowl, load the brush, mix my lather to a creamy consistency and paint, then swirl, then paint again to smooth the lather out.  I tend to lather twice and then just add a little water to do spot checks rather than a third lather and pass.  Finish with cold water, witch hazel or alum, Lubriderm 3-in-1 lotion or aloe vera gel (Lilly of the Desert) and, occasionally, a little Old Spice Classic cologne. But please, guys, if you use a scent use the least little bit so we don&#x27;t smell you coming.  A little goes a LONG way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;ve got nothing to compare the DE89L to save for a  faded memory of whatever old Gillette I used to use but I can tell you that if you&#x27;re coming back to wet shaving or trying it out for the first time, it&#x27;s hard to imagine a better razor for all but the toughest beards or more experienced shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would absolutely buy another if this were lost or damaged and have no interest in trying other models or manufacturers.  I do like the looks of the lined handle version and think it&#x27;s probably a little better in the hand.  One and done!.  No problem with it interfering with the lather.

    <li> I am new to DE safety razor use. A long time shaving soap brush user I just switched to the safety razor from cartridges. I decided on this model after some research. This has worked out great. The workmanship and performance are stellar. I have been able to get good shaves right from the start. The Derbys it came with along with this razor have me feeling good from day 1. This Edwin Jagger razor turned out to be a great choice for me.</li>
    <li> Best shave I ever had. Tells everyone who listens to buy this razor! I love the weight of it</li>
    <li> This is my first experience with a DE safety razor, I love it!  The Edwin Jagger is an excellent first safety razor, extremely well made and comfortable shave.  The chroming is perfect, the balance and heft feels just right.  Lined handles provide an added sense of grip.  There is a slight learning curve going from cartridge to DE safety, but well worth it.</li>
    <li> After several years of an electric razor, I decided to go back to a blade and looking at the cost of cartridges, went old school for a double edge safety razor. I did my research online and ordered the Jagger 89. I have enjoyed using it and love the shave I&#x27;m getting from the blades.</li>
    <li> I love this razor. I have spent so much on all of the tripple blades and I was so tired of them. I finally got a razor that can do the job for a fraction of the cost. I am greatful for this comfortable shave and the close shave it provides. I do not have to look any further for a great razor. Thanks for all you do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mitch langley</li>
    <li> This is my favorite razor now. The blades that it comes with (Derby) were only so-so for me but this is very personal and they might be great for you. I find that this razor with feather blades is my perfect (so far...) shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After a couple months use now this razor with feather blades and Taylor of Old Bond Street shave cream continues to be my daily go to combo. As ever with shaving, YMMV, but this is a well built piece of gear, which performs well and is a pleasure to use.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, well designed, saves money over 5-blade razors.</li>
    <li> This is my first safety razor. I love it. It performs better than expected and I will never go back to Mach 3</li>
    <li> After one drop the screw part of the head broke, now it´s useless. It didn&#x27;t even last 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy it, choose another brand.</li>
    <li> Great product! Fast delivery. Exactly as described. Very happy! It&#x27;s nice not to lose a pint of blood when I shave now!</li>
    <li> I picked up this razor after reading the review here on Amazon and the online shaving sites (badger and blade is my favorite).  I love classic, well made mechanical items.  This razor does not disappoint, the finish is amazing.  I have the \\&quot;De89L\\&quot; model which adds some texture to the handle, some have found the razor slippery, but I didn&#x27;t experience this at all.  German head and English handle (remind anyone of the new Rolls Royce with the BMW engine?)  This razor looks striking on the sink, and this isn&#x27;t easy to achieve in a man&#x27;s bathroom, but these guys have gotten it right!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One word of caution for first use:  If you are used to the Gillette twist to open razors, this will be a new experience.  Just take your time and handle your blade on the short edges.  It did take some practice to put the blade in the EJ, as this is a 3 piece design.  I was out of my Astra pure platinum razors, but I loaded this with a blue Astra razor, which for me have a tendency to drag in my trusty Gillette Super Adjustable (Black Beauty), so I thought this would be a good test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I have the razor loaded, used my Speick shaving creme, Proraso pre-shave with a few drops of Shave Secret oil (can you tell I hate razor drag, as I have really sensitive skin). HEAVEN from the time the blade touched my face.  Very light feel, but I could tell that the razor was cutting close without nicks or cuts.  There&#x27;s a review on YouTube of this razor by Geo, and I had the same experience he did.  I did a 2 pass, with grain and across the grain, and my face felt like I was in a barber shop getting a classic shave from someone who had years of experience.  I actually took down my Super Adjustable and put this in its place.  I never thought that would happen, as the Super Adjustable is considered the last true classic Gillette!  I&#x27;m even thinking about buying a back up DE89L (or to give as the ultimate gift).  I really was blown away, and I found myself saying \\&quot;wow\\&quot; over and over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just another note, how have the major companies have gotten away with selling 8 blade disposables with canned gunk and call it shaving comfort?  BS!  I bought into it myself, and I now know the error of my ways.  Just Goggle \\&quot;wet shaving\\&quot;, and you&#x27;ll see many of us are giving up spending $2 a piece on junk and going back to the tried and true and enjoying the experience.  No, I&#x27;m not a paid spokesperson, I promise.  It takes 10 more minutes, but the payoff is no red bumps, razor burn, etc.  And, the blades are less than 20 cents a piece most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re new to DE shaving or an old pro, spend the money.  Even if you find you don&#x27;t like the DE89L, it&#x27;s easily re-sold at one of the shaving sites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: March 2013...Still using this razor.  Haven&#x27;t even touched the others.  Bought a second one for travel, and the TSA doesn&#x27;t mind it on carry on!  I still love the way it shines when I wash with an old toothbrush and liquid soap!</li>
    <li> Love it.  Switched to the DE razor from the cartridge style.  Never going back to the cartridge razors.  Shaving is actually kinda fun now.  Everyone&#x27;s face is different but I use the Astra SP blades.  They seem to give me a pretty close shave with no irritation.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I wanted to save money on buying refill razors.  I&#x27;m getting used to shaving with it.  So far it is working out.</li>
    <li> I have been using this razor for a month, and I am new to DE shaving. I wanted to post this for the benefit of those considering DE shaving:&lt;br /&gt;-do not get nervous with the reviews of DE shaving - it is simple and easy.&lt;br /&gt;-this razor is well designed and of great quality.&lt;br /&gt;-DE shaving takes me same time as with my Gillette Fusion - better shave, same time.&lt;br /&gt;-I shave in shower with Proraso menthol;Vit E oil as prep.&lt;br /&gt;-after using Derby blades and then Wilkenson, now onto Feather;&lt;br /&gt;-Feather is the best blade so far, and after a week, no nicks or cuts, so don&#x27;t worry about the over-think out there;&lt;br /&gt;-will try Kai blades next.&lt;br /&gt;-I have a very tough beard, and consider my skin sensitive, but absolutely no issues so far.&lt;br /&gt;-shave with confidence and go save some cash.</li>
    <li> Only wish is it was Stainless Steel. Works as expected...&lt;br /&gt;I switched form Safety razor to this. I haven&#x27;t used Markur(2-peiece), parker(butterfly) or feather stainless still (just expensive)...but I liked this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Specially got this one as it is 3 piece and supposedly easier/better to clean.</li>
    <li> I have been using this razor for about a month and have gone from shaving every day to every other day.  I will never go back to a multi-blade cartridge or an electric!!</li>
    <li> I bought this safety razor after years of using more modern razors.  The modern razors all gave me razor burn, and I actually hated shaving because of this.  Ever since I started using this razor (about 8 months now) I haven&#x27;t had razor burn.  I actually enjoy shaving and even picked up an old style badger brush to enhance the experience.  I recommend this for anyone looking for a better, smoother shave.  It&#x27;s also a lot cheaper after the initial purchase due to how cheap the razor blades are.</li>
    <li> My son gave me this Edwin Jagger, DE89L, Safety Razor as a gift for Father&#x27;s Day. What a beautiful piece of machinery! Superb quality &amp; performance. The best shave I have had in a very long time. The craftsmanship &amp; chrome (Unbelievable shine) on this Safety Razor is outstanding! Overall a work of art. I look forward to shaving every morning. My # 1 Safety Razor! AAAAA+++++</li>
    <li> Get product.  Feels great to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I&#x27;m new to DE Safety shaving.  Did the Fusion, multi-blade trend for years.  Have always had problems with skin irritation and ingrowns.  In just four shaves a remarkable difference, and I still can&#x27;t produce the best lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Switch to DE shaving!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. I like the Derby blades.  But I&#x27;m sure others would want a more \\&quot;aggressive\\&quot; blade.  These are great for one&#x27;s first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. I will certainly buy more Edwin Jagger products.</li>
    <li> I just made the switch into saftey razors . Before I used the Hyrdo 5 blades, which are highly costly 4 blades for 25 dollers . This Ediwn Jagger gave me the closest shave ever, even used it to shave my head. The razor is very forgiving and very safe to use.  The replacement blades are cheap only 9 dollers for 100 blades. Every one should make the switch you will save alot of money and also have the closest shave ever.</li>
    <li> This is my first safety razor so I cannot speak from a wealth of experience. I like it, but I can definitely see why some people might want a longer handle. It is easy after you practice slowly and I have only cut myself once.</li>
    <li> Tried this but it did not give me as close a shave as my Gillette razor. Did not like the feel.</li>
    <li> This razor is so nice. It has a heavy and solid feel. I got the blades that go with it. They change very easily. I change it every week. Just unscrew the handle and separate the two pieces that make the head. The blade is right in the middle. Be careful but it is easy to do.&lt;br /&gt;I leave it in the shower and it has not rusted at all. The shave seems to be closer and I have no razor  burn with it. Very smooth. Once you start shaving with this razor you will never go back to those disposable type.</li>
    <li> One day I decided that I wanted to ditch the electric razor and learn to shave like a man.  That&#x27;s when I bought this old school safety razor.  I&#x27;ve been using this ever since and haven&#x27;t looked back.  I don&#x27;t have a lot to compare this to since this is my first such product, but I&#x27;ve found that the Edwin Jagger has excellent weight and balance.  The materials are high quality and it is easy to change the blade.  Using a safety razor saves significant money in the long run since blades are so economical when compared to disposable razor heads or replacing an electric razor every few years.  As a bonus, I believe that this is made in England...nice to have products that aren&#x27;t from China.</li>
    <li> My father wanted to try traditional shaving, rather than the floppy-headed pseudo-techie silliness of today&#x27;s shaver styles; just a straight-forward, old-style razor with a fixed head.  The craftsmanship of this Edwin Jagger shaver is top-notch. I like the ability to switch blades - they swap out easily. My rating of 3 is from the fact that my cheaper plastic-bag blade shaver did just as good a job, and the shielding of the blade was better. I shaved myself before swapping blades and testing the shaver with my father, to be sure I could identify any cutting risk. If you&#x27;re shaving someone else, you need to pull the skin taught, and for us, electrics work better. I hesitate to bring the rating down to a 3, but it would dishonest for me to gush when for my own shaving and for my father, other options work better.</li>
    <li> Razors will pay for safety razor in about a year.  Double edge razor are worth 2 Mach 3 razors because they hold their edge longer.  I don&#x27;t shave with anything but safety razor since I tried it about a year ago.  Merkur razors are my choice but any razor would probably do.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;A [razor] is but the extension of a man&#x27;s hand, and this [razor] is but a complex tool. And he that wields this [razor] augments the power of a man and the well-being of mankind.\\&quot; Quote by - Henry Ward Beecher, modified by me</li>
    <li> I am fairly new to the safety razor shaving gig, and I was slightly intimidated by it. I usually buy Art of Shaving products, but decided to try something new. The razor arrived in short order and I was very impressed by the quality of the materials and workmanship. The handle is easy to grip when wet and the head glides right along my face with no problem. I highly recommend this razor for anyone looking for a close shave and who wants to get away from the &amp;#34;5 blade&amp;#34; trend in men&#x27;s shaving today.</li>
    <li> Initial review Sep 2013: The chrome finish is flawless and it looks great, however the manufacturing tolerances are substandard. While the razor does lock the blade in a fixed position there is a significant amount of play that allows the blade to be out of alignment with the shaving head when locked down.  If you are not very careful when tightening down the head the blade will be at an angle. You need to look closely, carefully position the blade, hold it in place and carefully tighten with the handle. The blade locator pins have some taper for alignment but not enough.  Once I am able to get it fully closed with the blade straight, I am otherwise happy with the shave it delivers. If the blade alignment were not an issue I would rate it 5-stars. The loose blade fit is tiresome, I did expect more based on the number of 5-star reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated Jan 2014: The loose blade fit has been determined to be due to the blades: particularly Derby and Merkur.  Switching to Gillette Silver Blue and Feather I found a tight fit with no loose fit and alignment problems.  For me the Derby and Merkur are poor blades compared to the Silver Blue and Feather.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor!  Love the feel of the ribbed handle which helps with holding on to it while shaving.  Looks great too.  The weight is just right.  Blades are easy to change, easy to clean as well.&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> I bought the Edwin Jagger De89lbl razor taking a chance that is was overpriced. I was wrong. For under $35 dollars it is a work of art. The heft and balance is excellent, the quality is unmatched for this kind of money. I own  a Merkur, a Parker and a couple  Gillette adjustable tto&#x27;s from the 1960&#x27;s. It shaves close and it took a very short time before the razor became a natural extension of my hand while shaving. I am very pleased with this razor. It became my favorite in short time. It is much better than my Parker and/or Merkur for around the same money.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see how you can get a better DE razor than this one. Awesome!</li>
    <li> just what we wanted-a gift</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a nice razor that works well for me, but this morning while I screwed the handle back on, the screw failed and ripped off into the stem rendering the razor unusable.  That honestly seems like something which ought not to happen, and it&#x27;s disappointing; the thing doesn&#x27;t seem corroded but there must&#x27;ve been a manufacturing flaw.</li>
    <li> i love the weight of this razor.  heavy and nice grip.  took a star away bc it if very easy to break.  don&#x27;t drop it, it&lt;br /&gt;breaks easily</li>
    <li> Great product and very sturdy. My husband likes it that you can just change out the blade, and saves you money in the long run. It&#x27;s the type of razor that we grew up with</li>
    <li> I have been using a Merkur Progress (adjustable) razor. It,too, is an excellent razor. But I had heard and read so many good reviews of Jagger&#x27;s DE89 series, that I had to get one. What a great find. I am using BlueBird blades [[ASIN:B002YIO56Q 100 BlueBird Razor Blades Hi Stainless]] in the razor and getting super close and super comfortable shaves. It is a bit smoother than the Progress and I like the idea of using a fixed-head razor that is spot-on consistent from shave to shave re blade setting. I&#x27;ve found this razor to be far superior to Merkur&#x27;s fixed-head razors with respect to comfort and the closeness of the shaves I&#x27;ve been getting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a well-made razor that shaves with likely as well as any fixed-head razor, you won&#x27;t find a better shave than the Jagger DE89 series razor with a good, sharp blade. With this said, I did find the razor shaved more comfortably with Bluebird blades than it did when I tried Feather&#x27;s blades: the Feathers felt a bit harsh and scraped my skin a bit, which is the norm for me when using Feather blades in anything other than Feather&#x27;s AS-D1 razor. Even with sensitive skin and a tough beard, no preshave products are required with this setup. Load the razor, use a good quality shave soap and brush, and have at it. The razor makes my daily morning ritual one that I look forward to. I like the razor so much that I&#x27;m buying a back up. Between this and the Progress, there really isn&#x27;t much more a wet shaver could ask for in utility and versatility from safety razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 06/04/&#x27;12:  Tried this razor with my second favorite blade, Astra [[ASIN:B001QY8QXM 100 Astra Superior Premium Platinum Double Edge Safety Razor Blades]]. The shave was great, more comfortable than the BlueBird blades. It may be that the Jagger DE89 series, at least for me, deliver an even more comfortable shave with these Astra blades. Still love Bluebird blades, but after this morning&#x27;s shave with an Astra blade, I may stay with Astras when using the Jagger, which has been pretty much daily since I got it. I do prefer Bluebird blades in my Merkur Progress, which has been resting comfortably on my &#x27;gear&#x27; shelf, and hasn&#x27;t been called into service since the DE89LBL arrived. I haven&#x27;t tried the Derby Extra blades that came with the razor--perhaps one day.</li>
    <li> My first razor was a Gillette double edge safety razor, now that I have gone back to a D/E  the Edwin Jagger DE89lbl  is a top of the line D/E, that I even bought my son one he loves it compared to the Gillette atra.&lt;br /&gt;.. also one package of 5 Derby blades are included with this razor when purchased from amazon</li>
    <li> New to wet shaving and after doing research and reading too many blogs, I decided on purchasing this as my first razor.  I was not disappointed at all.  It is packaged well, and seems to be a quality product.  It&#x27;s a 3-piece razor and it&#x27;s real easy to clean and provides an awesome shave!  I use Astra razors with this razor and have not had a shave this close since I was in high school.  I would recommend it to anyone new or experienced in wet shaving.</li>
    <li> What else can be said? The many reviews speak for themselves and mine isn&#x27;t much different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I will mention is that it only took a couple of shaves to get comfortable with this razor. I have however switched to a different blade that I enjoy a lot more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I too am happy to be kicking the Gillette cartridges to the curb! Good Riddance!</li>
    <li> I have used the Mekur 23C Long Handle for the past several years. The EJ89 is a far better looking and performing razor. Much better quality than the Mekur, The Merkur is now in the deep bowels of the vanity.</li>
    <li> I love everything about it.  It feels sexy in my hand and this sexiness is imparted onto my face.  My girlfriend won&#x27;t stop touching my face since I started shaving with this thing.  It is not very often that a shaving device can improve one&#x27;s quality of life, especially in such a short amount of time, but this razor definitely has.  It is a pleasure to use.</li>
    <li> As near as I can tell, Edwin Jagger razors are EXACTLY like Muhle razors, which cost a good deal more - sometimes twice as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There may be minor variations in handle styles, but the heads are the same. Neither brand specifies where the razors are made. Muhle from Germany? I doubt it.  Jagger from England? Maybe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, Muhle and Jagger razor heads and handles are completely interchangeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read the reviews of Muhle razors. Other customers make the same point.</li>
    <li> I got fed up with the high price of the multi-bladed disposables and thought I&#x27;d give this a try due to the favorable reviews.  The razor reminds me of another era, when there was pride in manufacturing and quality was something expected.  It is a beautiful piece of machinery!  In fact, I had to show it off I was so impressed.  My son was so impressed he bought one, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found with this razor that it takes me three passes to get a baby-bottom smooth shave.  It was a little intimidating at first to go to the single edge razor as it has a different feel, but it has gone well.  One must have a different approach than with the disposables--it is more of a war of attrition using short strokes and not pressing down much, than getting all the whiskers off fast.  I have found it works well with this razor to first shave with the grain, then sideways, then against it, if desired, lathering between each shave using a good brush.  It takes me twice as long to shave as before.  I get about four or five shaves to a blade and I have a heavy beard, your mileage may vary....</li>
    <li> After doing some research and reading the exceptionally large amount of positive reviews on this razor, I decided to take the plunge and buy one.  So far, I am very happy with the purchase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My beard is relatively coarse. The razor cuts through hair like it&#x27;s slicing through hot butter.  This comfort level was about equal to my previous experience with a vintage plastic handled Gillette Tech, but the Edwin Jagger was able to cut significantly more hair in a single pass due it its heft.  Less passes &#x3D; less chances to screw up, and less razor burn. I was able to get an acceptable shave after only 2 passes plus touch-up.  One more pass against the grain would have likely made my face perfectly smooth, but I prefer not to shave ATG.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those thinking of switching from a multi-blade, this razor should provide at least an equally close shave with much less pain and a fraction of the cost of consumables.  Don&#x27;t let the $40 up front cost fool you; the EJ would pay for itself after a single 20 pack purchase of Mach III blades!  I use Van Der Hagen soap (only $2 a puck from Wal-Mart,) a Tweezerman brush (around $20 on Amazon) and Mennen Skin Bracer ($8 a bottle from CVS.)  Styptic pencil is optional, and also cheap.  After the initial one time razor and brush costs, things will even out in a hurry.  Your shave will also be a much better experience even using baseline soaps like mine, as long as you read up on correct procedure.  For those with sensitive skin or are prone to break outs (like me,) a few weeks of DE shaving with the rain of your hair will clear things up quite a bit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the instrument (which it is rightly called) is spectacular!  Has a nice weight to it, and is super shiny!  With its prettyness in mind, keep it out of reach of children, especially while loaded!  It&#x27;s a 3 piece razor.  This means that there&#x27;s virtually no moving parts to break, but the blade is slightly harder to install.  The head holds the blade in snugly.  Excellent engineering and cosmetics here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor also comes with a 5 pack of Derby blades.  This is a nice incentive, and the blades work well on my face.  Play around with other blades if you want, but these should be adequate for shaving.  They can also be purchased in bulk for a song.  If they don&#x27;t work with your face, you&#x27;ve only got 4 more to use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a great product to have.  In time it will make the shaving process less of a pain to the face and wallet. You can pursue the more important aspects of your life, and be clean shaven while you&#x27;re at it!  I&#x27;m thinking of buying another one of these for my father on his big 5-0!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ps- Amazon was very easy to work with.  The product arrived exactly when it was supposed to.  It was well packed, and shipped with free supersaver shipping!</li>
    <li> I use this and my Gillete razor still. I can get a faster shave with the Gillete and almost as close. It&#x27;s easier to miss spots with this since it&#x27;s a 3 step process. I purchased this to save money and that I am, but I&#x27;m also loosing time and cutting my face up more. That being said, your face feels amazing after you use one of these. I am currently using Feather blades with this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll keep it short and sweet; I&#x27;ve had this razor for almost a year (bought June 11 2011), and it has always given me close shaves since I first bought it. The chrome is still nice and shiny, it looks brand new even though it sees heavy use. This is my first DE razor and it was very easy to get the feel of shaving with it. I highly recommend this razor, a great buy.</li>
    <li> The quality of the disposable razors has worsened over the last couple of years while the price has increased. This combo finally drove me to get back to using a tool I haven&#x27;t used since I was 17, the DE razor. I kept coming across excellent reviews of the Edwin Jagger DE89 over Merkur and several other top names.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t comment on the others, but this razor is fantastic. From my first shave, the razor felt comfortable in my hand and well balanced. My shaves are close and nick free. I had forgotten just how great shaving with a DE razor was! Right now I&#x27;m using my usual canned shaving cream. Maybe it&#x27;s time I go to the &#x27;ol brush and cream/soap treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t regret buying this razor.</li>
    <li> Excellent Razor! My go to razor and every shave razor. Very seldom will I use a different razor only because I have a few and need to use them occasionally. Works great with any double edge blade but put a high end or extremely sharp blade in it and you can expect a great barbershop close, baby butt smooth shave. Not very aggressive but not mild either. Great weight. Interchangeable if you&#x27;re one that would like to try different handles. It&#x27;s my baby! Superior chrome finish and superior craftsmanship!!! Great starter razor but will probably end up being your only razor. :)</li>
    <li> WOW. I bought an inferior Double edge razor (Cherir, which I do not recommend at all) on Amazon...It was my first delve into the safety razor category.&lt;br /&gt;I shave my head also and was a little concerned about how this experience was going to go.&lt;br /&gt;The first razor I bought for around 17.95, not the cheapest but I thought it was worth the price to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;Every fear I had about using a double edge razor happened!  Cuts every time I used it, razor burn, complete failure.  AND I watched several YouTube videos, used a good shaving soap and brush so I would be as safe as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then a friend suggested I don&#x27;t &amp;#34;Cheap out&amp;#34; and try a real good double edge and see how THAT works.&lt;br /&gt;I have used the DE89Lbl 6-7 times now and not one cut, 0 irritation and baby smooth skin!  I can&#x27;t rate this high enough, so much easier to use on my skin...What a pleasure to use.  Spend a few extra bucks...You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> First let me tell you that I&#x27;m 67, been wet shaving for, well lets just say 50 years now.  I started with a Safety Razor but left them after I could no longer find blades.  I&#x27;m so happy that I have found them making a comeback after all these years.  The Edwin Jagger was everything I was told it would be.  Great to look at, and really great to use, don&#x27;t let the short handle bother you, the razor works great and is easy to hold on too.  Now I have not used it in the shower but normal shaving at the sink and keeping my hands dry the razor is not slippery so don&#x27;t worry about dropping it.</li>
    <li> Very impressed with the quality of this razor. I&#x27;m new to safety razors after getting tired of the modern plastic disposable junk I have used my whole adult life. This razor is solid and heavy, and the blades are extremely sharp. I get the closest, smoothest shave I have ever had. Now I know why my grandfather never used disposables.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying this is the only razor I have/have had. That being said, I&#x27;ve like it since I got it. Good handle length, weight, balance. One of those things you&#x27;ve got to feel with your hands. Without comparison, I like.</li>
    <li> I love this item and it works really well. It gives a close shave and with NO IRRITATION!!!!  After telling some of my friends about this razor now they want one.</li>
    <li> Great quality, weight and design. Feels great in the hand and is solid. A great was to start into the world of safety razors.</li>
    <li> I&#x60;m a newbie to DE shaving and have been using a Timor TTO for a few weeks now, which I purchased locally. After reading the reviews on the EJ DE89 I decided that I had to have this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After receiving this impressive razor and shaving with it, I feel like tossing the Timor in the rubbish dump. It&#x60;s like comparing a pickup to a Rolls Royce. The only reservations I have is whether the chrome finish will hold up years from now. I guess time will tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I don&#x60;t think you can go wrong with this razor. The only other DE razor I&#x60;ll be buying after this, is probably another one, preferably with Barley finish or the smooth chrome handle.</li>
    <li> Looks great.  I was nervous at first thinking I would hack up my face.  I found that going back to shaving with a straight razor was like getting back on a bike, you never forget.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift after my boyfriend continued to complain about the quality of disposable razors.  Even after doing a lot of research on the options/brand, I was still concerned if this was a good purchase---but WOW, this is an amazing razor!  Extremely high quality and well-designed beyond my expectations!  While it is not very long (compared to disposable stuff), it still fits comfortably in his hand (and he&#x27;s a big guy with huge hands) and stays easy to hold, even when wet. It has absolutely changed the way he feels about shaving!  He absolutely loves the way it works and feels, and he found the switch to safety razors to be very easy using this product.  The blades were also great and his favorite type (after trying a number of brands).  Would HIGHLY recommend to anyone thinking about trying a safety razor---you won&#x27;t be disappointed and you won&#x27;t go back to disposable.</li>
    <li> nicely made, built to last, really good chrome finish. Holds blade  securely. Hefty feel took a little getting used to but love it.</li>
    <li> The razor is a 3 piece razor.  It has a handle, and a two piece head.  The razor goes between the two head pieces, and everything is held firmly together when you screw the handle to the head.  The handle is just the right length.  The barrel has lines in it which makes it less slippery when wet.  The head is heavy, which is good.  The weight of the razor is all you need to shave--there is no need to apply pressure.  It has a great feel.  It is not adjustable, which is a good thing in my mind,  as there is nothing to get gunked up with leftover soap/hair, and I couldn&#x27;t imagine wanting to adjust it anyway.  Clean-up is a breeze.  Safety demands that you give your full attention when changing blades--they are DE razor blades, after all.  But once changed, it is a very safe razor.    I am able to achieve a baby smooth shave (BSS) in 2 or 3 passes, using [[ASIN:B0022R947O Feather Hi-Stainless Platimum Double Edge Razor Blades]].  The gap between the razor edge and razor housing is perfect.  The shave is a little more aggressive than the much more expensive [[ASIN:B0046JVV6S Feather All Stainless Steel Double Edge Safety Razor]], which takes 3-4 passes due to its less aggressive bite, and costs 6 times as much.  Note:  Feather makes razor blades and razors.  The feather razor blades and the Edwin Jagger razor are a better combination, in my view, than the Feather razor/feather razor blades.    I should note that I did have a problem with the first Edwin Jagger I received from Amazon.  The blade edge did not line up with the head&#x27;s edge, which is not good, and causes nicks.  Since I only have a sample of two to go on, I don&#x27;t know if this is a quality control issue, or if the first razor I received was the only defective unit--but you should probably check blade alignment before you shave.    In any event, Amazon has an excellent return policy, and they sent another one out with no push-back whatsoever, and paid for the return postage to boot.  What more could you ask for?    The most amazing thing about this Edwin Jagger DE 89LBL razor is that I am able to get a better shave from it than the much more expensive feather stainless still razor, which is 6 times the cost of this razor.    Do a search on \\&quot;geofatboy Edwin Jagger Chrome\\&quot; to find a video review/demonstration of the non-lined handle version of this razor.  Then watch his review of the much more expensive Feather all-stainless razor.  In it, he seems to enjoy the shave much more from the Edwin Jagger Chrome--probably because he was surprised by the performance to price ratio.  I should thank geofatboy because it was his video that pushed me to make this purchase.    Review on the blades included in the razor:    The razor included a 5 sample pack of Derby Extra blades.  I did not like them as much as the Feather blades I already have, so I am saving them for emergency backup.    Other options:    I also use the reasonably priced [[ASIN:B004B6V24M 100% Silvertip Badger Bristle Shaving Brush]] and [[ASIN:B0015UWUFM Proraso Shaving Soap]] when I shave with this razor.  These, and an old coffee mug are all you need to open a new and very enjoyable horizon.</li>
    <li> Awesome. I love my Edwin jagger double edge safety razor. Great size for me. It is truly the last razor I will need. And it ends up being cheaper in the long run than plastic razors,</li>
    <li> I bought this razor for my boyfriend and he loves it because he can get a clean smoother shave. He says that them other razors you buy at the store don&#x27;t work well especially since facial hair is very course so we both have been trying to find a single blade I finally found this one we read the reviews and done some more research so when he was satisfied I bought it for him He&#x27;s been very happy with the single blade and it shaves very well extra smooth :)</li>
    <li> Maybe you could buy a fancier razor for more money, but this one certainly works and it looks good, too. I feel like a boss whipping out my double edge safety razor while everyone else is using their cheaply-made but expensively-sold plastic multi-blade razors. The blades included were a nice bonus.</li>
    <li> My shaves are closer, less irritation, and more bang for my buck. I am a happy customer. This is my first DE razor, and I bought it on reviews stating that it had a good balance and good build quality. I can attest that these reviewers weren&#x27;t lying. I did nick myself a couple of times when I was starting to shave but now it&#x27;s nick free. I use prosaro (I think thats the spelling) soap and shaving creams. Great stuff overall, no more razor burns and bumps. I started to enjoy shaving.</li>
    <li> Did a lot of research before buying this razor. I tried several vintage razors and liked the gillette red tip the best, so I thought I would try the Edwin Jagger to compare it to. It has been about 4 to 6 weeks now and I have found I always seem to go to the DE 89lbl razor for my best shave. The balance of this razor suits me better than my other razors and it gives me a very close shave with less chance of cutting myself.</li>
    <li> Like many others new to double edge shaving, I was trying to decide which razor to begin with. After much deliberation, I chose the Edwin Jagger DE89Llb. After 30 days, ten different types of blades, 4 different shaving soaps and creams, two different brushes, three different aftershaves/balms, and more cuts and razor burn than I care to recall (or ever had in my life), I was about to cut my losses and admit that maybe I couldn&#x27;t use a double edge. I decided to give it one more try and bought the Merkur 34c.    With the Edwin Jagger, I couldn&#x27;t get a good shave. The razor pulled my hair, cut my face, and in every other way, sucked. In order to get close, I had to make five, six passes, WTG (with the grain), XTC, and ATC, which would probably tear up anyones face. I read blogs, watched video&#x27;s, and couldn&#x27;t figure out what I was doing wrong. When the Merkur arrived, I put a feather blade in it and gave it a try. Wow! Three passes and my face felt like a baby&#x27;s bottom.  Then I tried the 7am blades, Astra, Crystal; each and every blade I have tried has been a pleasure. No burn, no cuts, and with half the time shaving and no complaints from my wife, I finally understand why double edge razors are fantastic.    Now, I have read that everyone&#x27;s face is different, every razor and every blade work differently together, what works for one may be awful for another. Well, this was awful for me and almost turned me off to DE shaving all together. Now I have a beautiful razor that I can&#x27;t return, and will never use again. Quality wise and look wise, this is a great razor. But it all comes down to the shave, which is why I cannot help by to recommend AGAINST buying this razor, at least if you&#x27;re just beginning. I give it two stars only because it obviously works well for others, and you can tell it is well made.     - --    One more thing: the EJ is slightly lighter than the Merkur 34c, but a big issue is that more than half the weight is in the handle. How can you let the weightof a razor do the work, if the head doesn&#x27;t pull the rest of the razor along?</li>
    <li> awesome love it!&lt;br /&gt;My first DE Safety razor and most likely will last me many years. very well made.&lt;br /&gt;love it</li>
    <li> I am a 24 year old tired of buying disposable razors that leave your face feeling like some grated cheese. I bought this razor, a pack of 115 blades, omega soap, badger brush (aprox. 120.00 of investment  and believe me, you will save alot of money and your face will be very thankful for this purchase. I got it and, yes, it es a very beautiful razor that shaves very well. My first shave I did not cut myself and my face had never felt that good. I used the feather blades and they do a great job, you dont even feel like you are shaving, its more like it glides on the skin.   So, the blades are very cheap and very well made ($35.00). Its gonna take me a while to run out of blades since I got the 110 or 115 pack and you get like 15 brands, good brands I must say. The first package I used, as I mentioned before, were the feathers. I have never shaved that easy before and I enjoyed shaving the old way with the brush and warm lather, which by the way, tingles on your skin.  Go ahead and save some bucks and invest on everything you need for a change in your shaving habits, you will not regret spending some bucks on this after you find out how nice it feels.</li>
    <li> I most recently got into wet shaving and DE shaving in a pretty major way. To say obsessed may be an understatement. I ordered a few razors to decide which one I liked best and while I really admired the EJ DE89 from an aesthetic perspective, I was worried about the length of the handle. I&#x27;m female and I wasn&#x27;t sure how the short handle would work in the shower when shaving legs. I also ordered EJ Heather (ladies model) and decided to keep that once I compared the handle lengths. I really wish the DE89Lbl and Heather model would have a baby because it&#x27;d be the perfect EJ razor baby ever. The problem with the Heather is there is no knurling so the grip is uncomfortable to maintain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, I would recommend this razor on the craftsmanship alone. Also, if you&#x27;re considering wet shaving at all, but are hesitant, just jump - you won&#x27;t regret it. Closest shave, it&#x27;s not a gender specific interest (women can DE shave too), and it&#x27;s far less expensive than cartridge shaving (even by DSC and Harry&#x27;s prices).</li>
    <li> After a couple of months the shaver at the base started flaking. Overall I thought I would love the switch to safety razor shaving but I don&#x27;t. My hair is too coarse, too dark and too much to shave with this thing. This is perfect for someone with light blond and thin facial hair that won&#x27;t look obviously ridiculous if he misses a spot (or ten) because he was using this razor. If you buy this razor it&#x27;ll be a decent novelty for a short time then you&#x27;ll switch back to regular razor shaving with the disposable head razors.</li>
    <li> Before I write much on this razor, I would like to say that it is VERY well constructed.  Just holding the razor a person can tell that they have a quality product in their hands.  It&#x27;s nice and heavy, the shave is a little more aggressive than a Merkur 34c, but not overly so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The major problem I had was the handle.  The razor is so heavy that the handle becomes &amp;#60;d&amp;#62;slicker than snot on a door-knob&amp;#60;/d&amp;#62; when it&#x27;s wet with shaving soap!  YIKES!  I almost drop this razor each time I use it because of the smooth chromed finish...the handle needs to be knurled, or something.  Right now this razor, although it gives a good shave, is almost useless to me.  I&#x27;m forced to hold it right under the shaving head because the handle is so slippery.</li>
    <li> Excellent first DE Safety Razor. No flaws and great shaves. I got this based on many sterling reviews. It&#x27;s at a competitive price point compared to Merkur. No regrets. It&#x27;s a keeper</li>
    <li> Upon picking it up, you can tell this thing is quality.  Very well made, classy, and timeless.  You simply can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
    <li> Out of a few razors, this is easily the best! I had a butterfly style opener that broke with just normal use, as well as a cheaper plastic one that requires you to apply some weight, while this one doesn&#x27;t. After about a couple years of use, I dropped this onto hard floor and the head broke off the stem while attached. I emailed Edwin Jager directly to ask for advice how to remove the threading that broke off into the handle. What do they do? Send me another one, complete with soap and aftershave, as well as some extra razors. I mean, it was completely my fault the razor broke, but when they got news of this, they decided the razor should not have broken even when dropped, that&#x27;s how high of standards they have for their products!&lt;br /&gt;Oh, the razor itself is excellent too. The lined detail helps to grip the razor compared to no detail (I&#x27;ve handled them to compare at a shaving store). Only thing I&#x27;m nitpicking is I wish the handle itself was a bit longer and wider, but that&#x27;s just me, I&#x27;m tall and have large hands. No major complaints at all, and that&#x27;s customer service I will never forget. That&#x27;s customer service that will make me their customer for life.</li>
    <li> This is a good mild razor.  The build quality is way above the Merkur&#x27;s in my opinion.  My only issue with this razor it that it is too mild for me.</li>
    <li> After a few months of research I chose this Edwin Jagger over the Merkur. I am extremely happy with my decision. The chrome finish is elegant. The  razor is extremely easy to use and offers the perfect weight for a nice quality shave. Edwin Jagger is a very reputable company in the single blade razor market and lives up to its expectations. I have been using this razor for roughly 1 year now without any loss in quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit skeptical about using the single blade razor after many years of using the Mach 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.... if you catch my drift only to find that my skin was always very irritated from the excessive blade shaving. With this razor I can get just as clean as a shave with a heavy reduction in in grown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GREAT FOR BEGINNERS!</li>
    <li> This was my first experience with a safety razor. I was very excited to use it when it first came. I liked the look and feel.  I purchased the sandelwood shaving cream,  and a variety pack of blades. I used a bic blade the first time I shaved and Carved the hell out of my face and top of my head. I have a very thick beard and I am in the military so I have to shave daily. I figured it was lack of experience as to why I carved my face and head nevertheless  I changed the blade the next day to a Lord blade and had a completely different experience. Blade and razor produced one of the smoothest shaves I have had in almost a decade. I have since tried a variety of blades and gone back to the bic blades. Everytime I put a bic blade in I feel like I am pulling hair out and carve my face. I do not recommend any bic blades with this razor. I very much enjoyed this razor. I had no complaints or issues with it until I dropped it on the ground while shaving and the part that screws the head of the blade to the handle broke. I had the razor for aprox. 2 months before it broke. Had it not broke on me I would have rated it a 5. I rated a four star because I did drop on the ground  from about 5 and half feet while shaving so I only have myself to blame. Despite that I would have figured that for the price it should have withstood at least one fall from about  five and half feet.  Because it broke so easily I did switch to a different razor, parker 99r, which is a lot heavier and does not have a screw at the head. I will post a review once I have had some experience with this razor.</li>
    <li> First safety razor ever. I really like the design. It has slots on the bottom which help get hair out when you rinse which I like. Has a good weight that feels natural.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a week.  It has exceeded all other shaves I&#x27;ve gotten from electric to multi blade modern razors.  My skin is easily irrated, since I&#x27;ve used this it has been little to no problem.  Get the soap and a brush watch the YouTube videos by shavenation and enjoy shaving again.  Plus blades are less than $3 a pack.  Initial investment for me has been just over $100 but from here on it will be shave soap and blades. $3 a month and $10 every 2-3 months on shave soap.  It&#x27;s better all around</li>
    <li> All of the good things written about this product are true.  I have a very heavy beard--twice a day shaver if I have an evening date or meeting.  My suffering grows exponentially with each additional blade in the multi-blade fiascos offered by consumer product giants.  This razor is sheer perfection, and a blessing to those with heavy beards.  Don&#x27;t let the cost stop you.  If you&#x27;re a heavy shaver, you&#x27;ll save HUNDREDS of dollars per year over the grocery store razors, all the while enjoying your far superior shave.  It&#x27;s hard to say how this product could be better.  Simply excellent.</li>
    <li> I am brand-new to the world of double-edged razors. Like many others I was sick and tired of spending obscene amounts of money on disposable cartridges that did little more that rip the whiskers out instead of cutting them. For a couple of years I used a Gillette Fusion shaver, which, as far as disposables go, is a good razor. I got a decent shave from the Fusion, and the blades lasted me a decent amount of time, but I just wasn&#x27;t getting as close a shave as I (or my wife) would like. I also hated throwing away so much money on throw-away cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;After seeing something on TV about DE Razors, I decided to look into them a little more, and realized that there is a real surge in the popularity of these \\&quot;old fashioned\\&quot; razors, and I decided to give it a try. I am very glad that I did. I have never had a better shave.&lt;br /&gt;The first time I went to shave with my Edwin Jagger De89lbl I had my styptic pencil at the ready, and the local ambulance crew on speed dial, because I figured I&#x27;d end up slicing my jugular at some point in the process. I was very pleased to realize that these blades aren&#x27;t nearly as scary or dangerous as some make them sound. After about a week of shaving with this razor I have not nicked myself even one time.&lt;br /&gt;In regards to the Derby Extra blades,they seem to me as though they are not particularly sharp. In fact, I find that the only way I can get a smooth shave on my neck is to go against the grain which is supposed to be a no-no in the world of double edge shaving. I am now awaiting the arrival of \\&quot;Feather\\&quot; blades which I suspect will be much sharper. I don&#x27;t mind the shave from the Derby razors, but it does take a little longer than it seems like it should, and they irritate my face more than I anticipated.&lt;br /&gt;The shaver itself is first rate, and I would recommend it to anyone interested in DE shaving. The weight and balance of the shaver couldn&#x27;t be better, and it is very classy looking. I, for one, am very pleased with my decisionto make the switch.&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have is that I cannot find the blades in any stores. I can only get them online which is less than convenient when I need new blades and I am traveling.&lt;br /&gt;I believe that if stores were genuinely concerned with \\&quot;going green,\\&quot; this would be one area they could promote that would actually make a difference and reduce the load in our land-fills, but I suspect they make a much larger profit on disposables, and that is as far as their \\&quot;green\\&quot; concerns go. Perhaps if the wave of popularity continues to rise the stores will take note and begin to carry these items once again.&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with my purchase, and more importantly, my wife is very pleased. She has always liked me smooth-shaven, and she couldn&#x27;t be happier with the shave I get from my new DE razor. If you&#x27;re sitting on the fence about DE shaving, wait no longer. Jump in with both feet. You will be glad you did.</li>
    <li> Great razor, doesn&#x27;t matter which blade I use I get a nice close shave.  No more than two passes gets me baby face smooth.  Look forward to shaving each morning.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving for over 45 years. I have a collection of vintage razors, in part to get past the boredom of shaving everyday. I admit to feeling better after a baby butt clean shave. I had been curious about the quality of new razors made from brass and looked here. I saw a few Mukers, looked nice but not enough for me to want one. But when I saw this Edwin Jagger I had to have one. If I could design a razor,this would be it. A little longer handle, good weight and A+ fit and finish. That is what cost the most to make a razor. Any defects will show when nickeled and chromed. So how good does it shave? I shave in the shower. while doing the brush and soap thing is fun, it takes a lot of hot water to get my beard soft enough to shave. So the last part of a shower i turn off the water after soaping up my face and shave. This razor is as good as any vintage maybe except one. The Gillette slim razor.&lt;br /&gt;I used an Astra razer since I have a pack open, will try the Derby&#x27;s another time. If you want your razor to last, treat it like jewelry. The fit and finish take a little care if you want it to last. I take mine apart, dry it with a towel(not the blade) and put it back together dry.Wiping the blade will remove the finish that makes it slick. Yes it takes an extra minute, but will keep all razors looking like new for a lot longer.&lt;br /&gt;You can spend more money on a razor but I doubt you get a better quality razor.I highly recommend this razor, in fact I am surprised to see anything of this quality in this day and age of what I call clown razors. You know, the plastic with 50 or so razors on each one that cost a lot but do NOT work as well. More marketing hype than razor.</li>
    <li> Well worth the money and exceeds expectations.  I am very pleased with this Razor and have enjoyed using it a lot.  I would recommend this razor to anyone who would like to experience the close shave that a double edge razor can provide.</li>
    <li> This is so far an excellent product.  I&#x27;ve had it 1-2 weeks and am thoroughly enjoying this razor.  It is quite attractive and obviously made well with a beautiful chrome finish.  Has an excellent weight and balance to it as well.  Even in a short time of shaving with a double edge, my face and skin feel much better and the irritation/bumps I used to get are all but gone.  I got sick of wasting money on these supposedly new and improved cartridges and wanted to give this a try, I can&#x27;t imagine going back.  The entire experience is more enjoyable and I get better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a quality product that could last a lifetime and only requires very inexpensive DE blades as opposed to several dollars for each disposable cartridge.  Over time you can save money, and make shaving more enjoyable instead of a chore that you dread.  Been shaving over 20 years and for the first time ever, I actually kinda look forward to it!  If you want to give it a shot, I would heavily recommend this Edwin Jagger razor.</li>
    <li> I really thought the quality of this razor was good, until I accidentally dropped it. The low end cast top snapped off at the threads, rendering it useless.</li>
    <li> Very nice razor for the money love the weight and size of this DE razor.  The derby blades that come with it aren&#x27;t the highest quality but they did the job.</li>
    <li> My first DE razor. Shiny like nothing else in your house. Heavy, well made.  Great price, Amazon Price rocks.  Wish I bought it months before. Great choice for beginners to wet shaving as well as old pros.</li>
    <li> great razor, wish handle was a little longer, have used for two weeks takes a little getting use to after using disposable razor nice shave</li>
    <li> Amazing quality and value plus a perfect shave everytime. Feels like a precision instrument and works like a fine one too!</li>
    <li> I have only gotten into wet shaving recently, but I have tried several different razors. This razor is exquisite and now know why I had so many recommendations to buy one. Do yourself a favor and give this guy a try, you wont be sorry. This is a short handle style and I am looking forward to trying a long handled one to see the difference.</li>
    <li> the razor os too aggressive for me.  No matter what kind of blade I use with it, I cut myself badly each and every shave.</li>
    <li> Simple, cheap blades, protects the face well when used with good shaving cream.  Trims the whiskers quite nicely and without the waste of cartridge razors.  I considered the Merkur razors but the online community swayed me this way and I&#x27;m glad.  Came with 5 derby blades to start with.</li>
    <li> There are far more technical reviews on this safety razor than mine; I just wanted to say that after much research I bought this safety razor and it is superb!  The chroming is so beautiful that I really didn&#x27;t want to use it--just admire it.  I have a hand that is large and I have no maneuverability issues nor a problem holding on to it.  It is a precision instrument and I can&#x27;t help but feel that it will be one to last me a lifetime.  I use the Wilkinson Classic double edge blade in it and am very satisfied.  You will be, too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to double edged razor shaving, and I read this was recommended for beginners. I absolutely love it, best shave I&#x27;ve ever had. I thought there would be more of a learning curve, but I didn&#x27;t have any nicks or irritation. I&#x27;m never going back to cartridge razors.</li>
    <li> Very smooth-shaving razor and the best chrome plating I&#x27;ve ever seen in my life. The Derby blades are a nice addition, but I prefer the [[ASIN:B001QY8QXM 100 Astra Superior Premium Platinum Double Edge Safety Razor Blades]].</li>
    <li> Words can&#x27;t even describe the level of pleased.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s like if Sean Connery were a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/10 would buy again</li>
    <li> Returning to Wet shaving after nearly twenty years of cartridges and Canned goo, Like most others I got into a research mode. Forums, Blogs, and visit to local shops resulted in me beginning to buy more equipment. After spending time and of course money, on anything I can get my hands on, including shavettes (!),  cheap imitations, and the likes, I decided to go for this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first impression after loading it up with the Derby sample blade, and applying a rich dense lather from my Godrej round, was that, this razor is Mild!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you must be aware, the razors are categorized into Aggressive, Mild and in between. Aggressive razors expose more gap for the blade to cut relatively longer hair. Mild razors expose very little gap and hence cut very short hair, and also are pretty safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having used to a rather aggressive butterfly razor, I found the 89L bit too mild. I wasn&#x27;t hearing much of the sharp (sweet) sound of the blade munching away the beard. As I went from pass to pass, I began to realize that this is indeed a good razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did appear mild, but surprisingly gave me a close shave. Probably the closest shave to date!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would still think the puritans who go for three razor methods, would put this as a in-between aggressive razor. But if you are like me and want to use just one razor, and yet look for that BBS, then the 89L is the tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course the nice weight, the shiny chrome, and the lines for the vintage look and grip, all adds up to its merit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pretty impressed with it. Hoping to master the DE wet shaving method with this beauty, and someday go for the straights :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor for a year and a half and could not be more pleased with it. My experience is the same as the other 5 star reviewers here so there is not a whole lot more I can add. I think the size and weight of the razor is perfect and it provides great shaves for me every day. It looks as new and shiny as the day I bought it so do yourself a favor and get a nice stand to display it on. Unlike a cartridge razor, there is no need to bear down. If you are experiencing irritation, make sure you&#x27;re not pressing too hard. Let the weight of the head do the work.</li>
    <li> I love this razor. I don&#x27;t know what else to say. This was my first DE razor and I wish It would have been my last. This razor is a work of art and a work horse. If you want to get into DE shaving start and end here. I bought several other DE razors but nothing equals the shave I get with my EJ.</li>
    <li> I bought this over a year ago and i paid $44 for it and now its $28. To be honest I am ok with that because this razor is so awsome. I have tried the Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor and this is much better. The razor is well made and feels very comfortable to hold. The handle is perfect size and i am able to get a pefect shave every time. I use it with the feather razor blades.&lt;br /&gt;For some reason Germany makes the best electric shaver, electric toothbrush and best razors. I know this because i own all three products. This has a nice premium feel to it and the i have not cut myself once with this. I had some trouble with the Merkur one. I don&#x27;t think there is a better safety razor out there. This is a steal if you can buy this for $28. I would seriously pay $75 for this product if i had to.</li>
    <li> Love it! best decision i have ever made. Not spending money on Gillette of such. its cheaper, easier, and leaves my skin feeling good.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor to replace an inexpensive one I bought from Sally&#x27;s beauty supply.  I wished I had just saved my money on the first one.  I cut myself everyday no matter how lightly I tried to hold the razor.  This one has enough heft to it where it feels like gravity will simply take care of it for me.  I am new to DE shaving, but I really wish I had heeded the advise others that have come before me gave freely.  Buy this razor.</li>
    <li> I love this Razor, heavy duty and shaves very close using Derby blades. For some reason, maybe me, the Feather blades don&#x27;t cut as close. I wish the handle were a little longer, but overall a great shave!</li>
    <li> Edwin Jagger is an old and well established company that is highly respected andfor a very good reason. I was originally from Invernahavon, Scotland on Loch Ness and my dad used an Edwin Jagger razor he purchased in London, England. Now the Razor was a bit old fashioned and I thought it was cheap,... it wasn&#x27;t I first learned to shave on that razor and only gave it up when I went into the U.S. Navy after we cameover here to the States. I left the military and had time for the old shaving ritual again and so at age 64 I went back to D E shaving at first I purchased a cheap razor that had the wing head opening doors, poor choice. Then I remembered my dads old razor we shared. I looked at all of the EJ razors on Amazon and chose the De89lbl chrome over brass hooya what a difference! This is the very best razor it holds the blade at just the right angle (very important) and though you have to unscrew the head to change the blade (that can be a pain in the ---) there is a very good reason for it the blade does not get wrinkled nor flop around in the head (most important if you don&#x27;t want to look like a leper from the T-paper on your face,.. not to proper). The razor has the right angle and proper blade exposure for the optimum shave no matter your face and beard (as long as you get the right blade match) The blade I use for now is called a &amp;#34;Shark&amp;#34; it&#x27;s ok but I&#x27;m still testing others. The blade is the most important item next to the right razor find the right shave balm for after and at the right scent well,... if you are not married the ladies will chase ya! (Amazon has both, scratch that they have it all right here)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dads razor lasted him till his death at 68 and he taught me the care and feeding of a good razor so I will be giving this one to my descendants. (if you don&#x27;t take care of it after each shave good luck because you will need to buy a new one every few years) Amazon is the best they always have stuff you never could find at a great price and quality without a major search and prime is sooooo worth it!! I&#x27;ve got Amazon Prime and I always get my stuff on time and sometimes way ahead of time! (BTW We all have Kindles so it is super for that also!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will Deason, Texasand quality without a major search and prime is sooooo worth it!! I&#x27;ve got Amazon Prime and I always get my stuff on time and sometimes way ahead of time! (BTW We all have Kindles so it is super for that also!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will Deason, Texas</li>
    <li> Great balance and weight. Makes shaving an enjoyable experience when you are using the less aggresive side. After a month of inconsistent shaves I finally realized the defect and returned it and will stick with my fatboy</li>
    <li> I like this a lot.  Use it every day before work.</li>
    <li> Bought for my son&#x27;s birthday.  Older son has one and loves it, so bought it for other son.  Both very happy with this razor</li>
    <li> I was in the market for a safety razor and being my first was a little overwhelmed with all of the options. Went with the EJ De89 and couldn&#x27;t be happier. The first few shaves have been great and the razor has worked flawlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great looking razor and the 5 free blades are a great start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended.</li>
    <li> Great razor. Heavy, and holds the blades at a good angle. Best shave I have had. I would suggest it to anyone looking for a close shave.</li>
    <li> When I got this I was amazed at the quality that it seemed to have. Chrome is very nice. After a few weeks of shaving it stills cleans up and shines.</li>
    <li> This razor is well made but I found it didn&#x27;t shave as close as a multiple bladed razor.pricey for the performance</li>
    <li> I read up on this style of shaving and ordered this along with a 100 ct box of derby razors and 100ct Astra razors along with Taylor of old bond street sandlewood shaving cream. So far I am loving this and I am never going back to shaving with Mach 3 razors again .  This is the best way to shave for me , it gets the job done without razor burn for me. This has a great chrome finish that is wonderful to look at and super easy to clean. The derby razors work great for me sharp and get the job done! I have used three razors of the Astra and two were sharp and one was dull.. So I am still waiting to get a couple more shaves in with these to say for sure there good or not.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver.  Good for someone new yo DE shaving and will be used for as long as you shave.  I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> Great tool for any man.</li>
    <li> Fantastic DE razor, mildly aggressive, it has great weight to it, and the chrome finish is very nice.</li>
    <li> Handle is shorter than I&#x27;d like, but otherwise a good razor.</li>
    <li> Ok, so here&#x27;s the deal,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live this razor.  Its my first attempt at a DE safety razor which I purchased based off of previous reviews.  One thing that attracted me to it was that based on other reviews its not that &amp;#34;aggressive&amp;#34; of a razor.  Meaning, I suppose, that the blade isnt as exposed as some others leaving room for error.  I should however mention that this razor can still mess you up! Badly! If you&#x27;re not careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me break it down for you:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)  If you have never used a Safety Razor, do your research or you&#x27;re gonna have a bad time.  You DO NOT shave with this thing like you do with a cartridge razor.  It will look like a scene from a horror movie if you do.  Saving with a razor like this takes A LOT more time than you are used to with a a cartridge razor.  Shaving with a Safety Razor is in of itself its own Art form.  You must first master the basic techniques of shaving with one at the same time really learning the intricacies of your own face.  PLEASE do your reaserch before going full hipster!  If not you WILL regret it.  I recommend a forum like this  http://www.reddit.com/r/wicked_edge/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Blades make probably the biggest difference by far.  I have only tried two different types so far.  The Derby blades that come with it are for me alright but not the best.  I did find the shave close but not impressive.  I ordered the Feather blades which were absoloutly amazing.  The cost of the Feather blades are much higher than many of the others but no where close to the cost of a Gillete cartridge, so we are still saving lots of money.  Find a buddy or three that want to get into this with you, each of you order different types of blades and give them a try.  Your skin type, hair type, etc all have an impact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3)  Purchase a pre shave cleanser such as Glycerin soap.  Some say its not important but I personally have had wonderful results.  Also, DO NOT use some crappy shaving foam or gel.  Get a proper shaving soap or lotion to do the deed.  See, problem is, when you get that nonsensical foam, it creates a thick layer that you spend a number of shaving strokes just to get to the base of your hair follicle.  All the while creating irritation.  A nice shaving soap lubricates very nicely and you are in closer contact with the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4)  I need to reiterate.  Technique is everything.  It takes some time to get good.  I must admit I am in the process of doing just that.  I rushed my shave the other day and boy did I regret that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have fun with it, get good, take your time and you will have the closest, most satisfying, least irritating shave you have ever had.per shaving soap or lotion to do the deed.

    <li> Bought it as part of a shave soap/razor Christmas present and my brother says it is the best shave he has ever had.</li>
    <li> Takes a while to get used to, but once you get the hang of it, you&#x27;ll never go back to commercial razors.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality and just the right &amp;#34;heft&amp;#34;.  I have rather large hands and was concerned the stem would be too short but I was happy to discover it is just the right size.  Blade replacement is a snap: while holding the stem in one hand, you simply twist and unscrew the head to replace the blade.  The only &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; is that the razor does not come with a case.</li>
    <li> Great investment!!! Looks great, works well. Is saving me a lot of money. Works better in the shower with an anti fog mirror.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best Double Edge razor that you can buy today.  The head has been engineered to prodvide an incredibly smooth and slick shave.  I had orginally bought a Merkur HD to start my DE shaving revival but was never happy with it as the HD is a bit more agressive and harsher.  And the finish is crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The DE89 is put together extremely well and metal parts are chromed superbly.  And it provides a smooth close shave with little effort and no blood.  The razor is balanced extremely well and you will enjoy using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edwin Jagger has several versions with longer handles (Chatsworth) that others (like myself) prefer, but this is the basic unit and will perform just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended.</li>
    <li> Excellent razor!  Extremely well build and the finish is superb.  The razor is well balanced and shaves great; I&#x27;m still trying to find the right blade for me but the included Derby blades are a very good place to start.  All in all, an excellent  investment for someone looking to get started in DE wet shaving or for anyone looking for a quality, mild shaving razor.</li>
    <li> This is an edited review as I had initially given this razor a 5 star rating after only two (2) shaves, which, of course, was dumb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did provide 2 excellent shaves with a one (1) day beard, a tad bit better than my Shick Xtreme3. However, when I used it for the third time going up against a two (2) day beard....it flunked! It pulled quite a bit and the shave was not that close. The Xtreme 3 can actually handle 3 day beards really well and far better than the EJ razor did on the two day beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I noticed, and it was beginning to be an annoyance, was that this razor was becoming uncomfortable to use because it is so HEAVY along with the fact that the handle is VERY slick, making the grip factor very poor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, I did not like having to disassemble the razor after every shave to clean it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As usual, Amazon was great about letting me return it and this little non-jewel will meet UPS tomorrow.</li>
    <li> I just love everything about this razor, the beautiful deep rich chrome finish, the weight, the simplicity, easy to clean, easy to change blades, and GREAT shave. I would not want to change anything about it. You will appreciate this Edwin Jagger every time you shave.&lt;br /&gt; Here is a very nice shaving stand that matches it very well I think you will enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;This razor hangs perfect from this stand and the lines match nicely. Looks nice on the sink and serves a real purpose.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B009ERABTU B009ERABTU]]&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this stand for under $21 shipped from seller Ian Tang and received it in two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Wanted to share with all since I spent so much time looking at razor stands for this great razor.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic razor. flawlessly made in every way. If I was stuck on a desert island stuck with one razor, this would be it. I have several others from Merkur and Parker, but this is my favorite. it works well on every type of fave and is engineered to perfection.</li>
    <li> I started using a Merkur Futur about 8 months ago and loved it at first but started to get annoyed with some of its issues like having no grip, too heavy, and not very agile. But this razor does it all perfectly. I use a mix of feather, derby, and wilkinson sword blades and all of them perform well in this razor. It iss a quick and painless shave with no nicks or in some cases &amp;#34;chunks&amp;#34; taken from my face. Some may want a longer handle though but this was perfect for me.</li>
    <li> I used to shave with either an electric razor or a 3+ blade type.  I&#x27;m not going back to either after getting the hang of using a safety razor.  After about three weeks of using this, there is no razor burn or irritation when shaving (with a shaving brush and soap).  There is a bit of a learning curve when using it as well as finding a razor brand that agrees with your skin, but this does not take long.  Lack of pressure and blade angle are key.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose the Edwin Jagger model here, because I wanted a razor that would last and had a low risk of breaking from moving parts.  The really nice chrome finish seems to guarantee durability, and it is a three piece model that only requires one to unscrew the handle to take it apart.  It also came with five Derby blades to get me started, so that was a plus. Replacing the blades requires some more attention than a butterfly open razor, but since I work around sharp object at my job, I have no problem handling the double edged blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am satisfied with this razor and am glad it was my first permanent tool for shaving.</li>
    <li> This razor is well made , the finish should last a long time. The razor shaves well. If you have never shaved with a safety razor look at the tips on You Tube.</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying that this was the first safety razor I have ever used and will probably be the only one I ever own. The quality is second to none. Perfect weight and balance. This is definitely an item that with normal care will last for many many years.</li>
    <li> Bought this as my first safety razor on recommendation from a few people and the high reviews on Amazon. Big mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it for ~8 months before it slipped out of my hand, fell on the bathroom tile, and the screw cracked. Since then, I bought a Merkur 34C and, after a month, I&#x27;ve realized how superior the 34C is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Edwin Jagger has some serious flaws:&lt;br /&gt; - The bottom of the De89lbl&#x27;s shaft is curved, so setting it down on the narrow rim of a sink is a bit tougher than the 34C (which can stand on its shaft).&lt;br /&gt; - The De89lbl&#x27;s shaft doesn&#x27;t have as good grip as a Merkur. In fact, it&#x27;s pretty slippy compared to the 34C.&lt;br /&gt; - Removing the blade can be a bit dangerous because you have to twist the head. One slip and you&#x27;ve sliced your thumb open (which happened to me twice). The Merkur, on the other hand, unscrews from the bottom!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems like the Edwin Jagger was made to look pretty without regard from practicality. Amateurs.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy just using this razor. It&#x27;s well balanced, moves with me without being cumbersome, and has given me the best shaves I&#x27;ve had in my life. I also purchased the Personna safety blades and am more than happy. I might move up to even sharper feather blades once I have more practice with the Personna.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor is beautifully chromed and easily disassembles. The value of buying this razor and blades vs. disposable blades for my regular razors is astronomical. I&#x27;ll never return to disposable blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Those who have complained about it not working have to understand that, when using a safety razor, one slants the razor at an angle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buying blades in a 100 pack will actually save you money over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High quality, heavy feel and an excellent shave indeed.</li>
    <li> I was honestly a little fearful at first,but after lathering up and the first couple of passes i was hooked. I dont think i will ever go back to a tripple edge razor again. Just the cost savings alone is worth using the double edge razor. My dad used one years ago and i tried it when i was around 18 back then. I was about ready for the ER after that shave. Have no fear give the EJ De88 a try. I love it and i have never had a shave so close and smooth.</li>
    <li> This shaver looks amazing. The quality is outstanding for the price - it&#x27;s certainly a must have for an entry level DE blade shaving experience. If you&#x27;re on the fence about the EJ, I&#x27;d suggest you</li>
    <li> I used a safety razor in Jr. High, and High School, but then changed to the disposables.  This is the 1st safety razor I have used in 44 years??  Where did the time go?  I had always used the &amp;#34;butterfly door&amp;#34; type razors before, while this one comes apart into 3 pieces.  It is not as big a deal, as you may think, but it is not as convenient as the &amp;#34;butterfly&amp;#34; type I used to use.  (Stiff hands, and fingers my be the problem)  In any case I deducted one star for that.  Gives a comfortable, close shave with the right blade.</li>
    <li> First, I&#x27;m a women and I use this for legs, so take my review with that in mind.&lt;br /&gt;This razor has a medium weight, which I think could be a little heavier.  The handle is only about 4&amp;#34; long.  It might not be bad for shaving the face, but I prefer the longer handles for legs as it&#x27;s easier to reach the back of your ankle while standing in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;The chrome is nice and smooth, and the quality of the razor overall is great.</li>
    <li> Works well,balance needs getting familiar with. But very close shave. I love the close shave, it works better that the multi blade shaves, much closer shave.</li>
    <li> Very nice razor, been using it about a year and am quite happy to give up the costly 5 blade razors.  This gives as good a shave as anything if you have some nice blades on it.</li>
    <li> We bought this after mu husband broke his expensive Art of Shaving safety shave. That shave dropped to the floor and the tiny screw broke, making the whole thing into a waste even thought the other parts were completely fine.  We were very happy about this shave: easy to use and compatible with Art of Shaving shave stand. But the same thing happened: it dropped to the floor and the tiny screw broke. Had to buy another one now. And this time we will try a different brand.</li>
    <li> ... as it gives me a closer shave than my original double-edge and - to me - worth purchasing but don&#x27;t know how it compares to other high ends but in the end. A razor can only do so much once you get into quality companies with good reputations (my assumption).</li>
    <li> After only two years of irregular use, the handle at the screw into the razor head snapped in half.  Luckily it did not happen while I shaving.  I literally picked it up to use and it was broken.  Wow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My father bought a double edge razor and it&#x27;s lasted 35 years.  That was my expectation.  How disappointing.</li>
    <li> Comes with five razors so you can get running while waiting for your personal favorites, solid as can be and has an excellent finish to allow for maximum smoothness.</li>
    <li> love this thing.  I don&#x27;t know why I haven&#x27;t been using a safety razor like this for all my life.  A milion times better than a disposable and an electric shave can&#x27;t come close to the closeness of a shave with a bladed razor.  I was afraid I would cut myself all over.  I guess that is why I didn&#x27;t try one before.  I can&#x27;t say I haven&#x27;t had a knick or two, but nothing compared to the razor rash I get with disposable razors. It&#x27;s amazing how clean of a shave I get with this.  To be fair, this is the only safety razor I have tried, but I don&#x27;t have a reason to try another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased a variety pack of blades as was recommended by several people.  The blade does make a difference.  My favorite is the Wilkinson Sword.  My second favorite is the Feather.  The Feather is sharper and gives a closer shave, but it also irritates my skin a bit.  I&#x27;m not bleeding all over like with a disposable, but my neck mostly gets tender.  I have to be careful with the Feather so I don&#x27;t knick myself as well.  The Wilkinson is much easier on my face and still gives an amazing shave.  I can even skip a day and not feel too bad.  I have my 5 O&#x27;clock shadow after 24hrs.</li>
    <li> I considered a lot of razors, went to a lot of websites, watched tons of videos. This one is amazing. The only gripe is I have big hands and the razor (like most safety razors) is smaller in the hand. I will not go back to cartridge razors anytime soon as this is cheap to use and will be up on mantle that one of my kids will look at one day long after I am gone. Looks and feels incredible and works fantastic.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he absolutely loves it!  He has complained forever about his skin being irritated from shaving, and since he has the razor, no complaints.  And the blades last MUCH longer!  I would highly recommend this purchase!!!</li>
    <li> This is my first safety razor that I purchased based upon reviews in amazon and shaving websites.  It arrived well without any issues and looked great.  It&#x27;s very classy looking, almost like something your grandfather could of passed down to you.  It seems solid and well crafted. My only complaint is that its a bit short for me and I&#x27;d say I have average size hands.</li>
    <li> I ordered a DE89Lbl from Amazon Warehouse Deals that was described as being in Like New condition. I figured maybe it was a return and that at the very worst it would have water spots and one of the 5 included Derby blades might be missing. But there were no water spots and all the blades were there, but I immediately noticed that the bottom of the screw on the part of the head that screws into the handle was shorn off. This was obvious because unlike the rest of the razor, it was not shiny chrome but dull, jagged metal. I shook the handle and heard rattling. It looked as if the broken off piece of screw was in the handle, and sure enough I was able to spin it out of the threads in the handle with the tip of a toothpick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took a photo of the shorn off screw under an illuminated magnifier so you can see what I&#x27;m talking about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A number of reviewers have had bad luck with this razor because of this screw. In some cases this screw sustained damaged as a result of the razor being dropped. It&#x27;s possible that the razor I received was dropped by a previous buyer, who then returned it. Of course there are certain objects one should avoid dropping at all costs, such as fountain pens and expensive double edge razors. But a tool designed to hold a blade used for shaving shouldn&#x27;t be that delicate or fragile, should it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also read on Amazon and elsewhere about DE89 owners who say that the screw eventually rusted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, it&#x27;s possible the screw on the razor I received broke due to the handle being over tightened. If you visit Edwin Jagger, then go to safety razors, then follow the link to order online, you are taken to The English Shaving Company of Sheffield, where this warning appears in the listing for this razor: &amp;#34;Warning: Do not overtighten the DE head. Cast metal is fragile if dropped.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I own three one-piece design double edge butterfly type safety razors that I inherited from my late father. All are Gillettes, and all were manufactured in the US in the sixties or seventies. They are solid tools built to last a lifetime or longer. I don&#x27;t know if my dad ever dropped any (knowing him, he probably did), but I doubt a single drop would suffice to damage one to the point of rendering it unusable. Because I have those, I don&#x27;t really need a new DE razor, but I&#x27;m eager to try a good quality safety razor of a type that is being manufactured today. The DE89 comes very highly recommended and I don&#x27;t doubt that it deserves the many 5-star reviews it receives, but the fact that it is built with a cast metal screw that apparently breaks pretty easily is for me a real deal breaker. The one I purchased from Amazon Warehouse Deals that was listed in Like New condition was marked down to nearly twenty bucks, and I can&#x27;t imagine paying over thirty for something so fragile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why buy a razor that you may have to baby and that, unlike the aforementioned older Gillettes, does not seem built to last a lifetime or more? To protect the cast metal screw from rust, you might have to disassemble the razor after every use and dry it. You will have to be careful to never ever overtighten the handle. And of course you must never drop the razor. I don&#x27;t see the latter as a terribly significant problem because as I say, you don&#x27;t want to ever drop a fountain pen either, not to mention glassware, cellphones, babies, etc. But that cast metal screw is clearly a problem with this razor (and maybe three-piece* safety razors in general) and although I&#x27;m disappointed that I received a DE89 with a broken screw, I think I may actually be lucky, because it would be worse if it arrived undamaged only to break in after the return grace period was past. I contacted Amazon about the problem with the DE89 I received and they sent me a prepaid return label and are giving me a full refund. *(Butterfly safety razors, which are sometimes called TTO razors for twist-to-open, are one-piece, the DE89 razors arethree-piece, and there are two-piece safety razors that are similar to the three-piece except that the bottom part of the head doesn&#x27;t separate from the handle. For more info see the article at Shaving 101 titled, &amp;#34;Types of Safety Razors.&amp;#34;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m probably going to order a Merkur 34C two-piece safety razor and see how that goes. It gets great reviews and is often compared favorably to the DE89 - in fact most reviews that compare them put the 34C ahead of the DE89 - and it won the About dot com Readers’ Choice Award for &amp;#34;World&#x27;s Best Razor&amp;#34; in 2011 and 2013 (e.g., see &amp;#34;The Ultimate Guide to Merkur Safety Razors&amp;#34; at Mister Shaver). It&#x27;s sometimes called by different names, such as the Hefty Classic or the Merkur HD (for Heavy Duty). Based on what I&#x27;ve read, it sounds as if it may be as well-built and durable as some vintage razors.similar to the three-piece except that the bottom part of the head doesn&#x27;t separate from the handle.

    <li> Very comfortable. I switched it for one that had grip though, as this doesn&#x27;t. It gets slippery when wet and if you get soap or lotion on it. Other than having no real grip, it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> The Edwin Jagger De89lbl is a good solid DE razor with a great finish and feel. You may read that this is a good starter... I think that this razor with a good blade, like Astra, Feather, or Bic, provides a good shave that will satisfy most people for many years. For me, shaving is a task that just needs to get done. I clean my face daily, I shave in the shower with whatever shave cream I have (even from a can), and I moisturize my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good skin care basics and a blade sampler pack will make all the difference for any shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like my Gillette Fusion, but it just costs to much and adds needless waste to the environment. I will still use it as I travel as the TSA does not allow razor blades in carry-on.</li>
    <li> this is a quality product for the money.  while I no longer shave with a blade (i use electric) for the many years i did use this razor i was very satisfied with its balance and use.</li>
    <li> This is a vast improvement over my Merkur 34C, which for the past 3 years I was convinced could not be improved on.  Wrong!  This handsome tool surpasses in every performance measure from the sparkling and flawless chrome finish to the perfect blade alignment to the closest, irritation-free shaves.  Definitely a best buy.  :-)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a month now since I got the razor. It&#x27;s been many years since I&#x27;ve shaved with a bouble edge razor. Wow, what a great shave! The workmanship is top notch. The only negative is get rid of the Derby blades. For me I bought some Wilkison Sword blades, and it was like butter shaving, what a difference. A great razor at a great price! Oh yea, blades are $.99 for 5 blades, what a savings compared to disposables.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been dealing with an increasing incidence of ingrown facial hairs caused by cartridge razors (I assume).  In my internet research, I came across the idea that switching to a double-edged razor might be the solution to my problem. Needless to say, I bit the bullet and ordered this razor. I&#x27;ve been shaving with it about two weeks now. The ingrown hairs are gone. My first three shaves, I bled a bit, primarily from accidentally slicing off the bumps where the two or three ingrown hairs kept showing up. I persisted despite the horrible little holes I made in my face, and was rewarded. By carefully shaving with the grain, I feel I am getting closer shaves than I&#x27;ve ever experienced. My face is smooth and I enjoy the ritual involved in this method of scraping my face clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes longer - about twice as long as with a cartridge system. In the recent past, I&#x27;ve been shaving with the [[ASIN:B005ACNPKA Remington King of Shaves Azor 5 Blade Manual Men&#x27;s Razor with 3 Cartridges]] which I reviewed for Amazon (and liked) or the [[ASIN:B000052YHS Gillette Mach3 Classic Razor - 1 Razor, 2 Cartridges]]. Neither razor gives anywhere near as close a shave as the Edwin Jagger. I&#x27;ve been trying different blades, and so far I like the [[ASIN:B001G5FOLI 10 Feather Razor Blades NEW Hi-stainless Double Edge]] and the [[ASIN:B004SGKMA0 Derby Extra Double Edge Razor Blades, 100 Count]] that came with it seem OK too, although I tend to cut myself more often with those. One star off for a slightly slippery feeling. I wish the handle was a bit more friction friendly when in contact with my hand.</li>
    <li> does a great job easy to use clean and very good looking razor, this was my first razor and i use it everyday .. two big thumbs up, no need to upgrade here this ones with me for the long haul ! very easy to keep looking shiny on my Mission Style Wood Shave Stand for Razor and Brush</li>
    <li> High quality razor. I decided to try this razor since the disposable razors are quite costly.  Am very satisfied how long the blades last and saving some money.</li>
    <li> Not buying into the 3,4,5 bladed hype and of course the huge investment just to get a close shave with these blades I decided to buy a safety razor. I am old enough to remember my father and grandfather shaving with the old \\&quot;butterfly\\&quot; double-edge razors. I purchased this DE 89L based on reviews. After opening the package and feeling the weight of this razor it was Obvious the quality was there. It is heavy and chrome plated with lends to its attractiveness. I have shaved about ten times with this since I got this over a week ago and have not cut myself once. I don&#x27;t understand all the complaints about people cutting themselves with DE razors unless they are dragging the razor all over their faces everywich way. I always shave in a hot to warm shower and shave last. I use a popular transparent shave gel and rub the gel into the beard with my finger tips against the grain of the beard thus lifting the beard for a close shave. I use short,slow,deliberate strokes with only enough pressure to engage the blade to the beard. I have to say that I definitely have gotten a closer shave than with my old Atra  twin cartridges or three blade disposables. I&#x27;ve read people saying they have to shave twice to get a close shave. I would say twice around the jaw line but otherwise once is close enough. It takes me no longer to shave with this DE razor than with my old Atra cartridge razor. Of course this razor will last a lifetime but you will want to take it apart after each shave and dry it after rinsing thoroughly, reassemble razor but don&#x27;t retighten just leave a little \\&quot;play\\&quot; until next use, this will allow the razor to dry thoroughly and not corrode the razor. This razor cost me a little under $40 but I figured with the price of a pack of 6 multiblade cartridges being around $20 this razor easily pays for itself after using a pack of 10 DE blades at less than $2. Oh yes, the weight of this razor is obviously much more than the current modern multiblades but we aren&#x27;t talking about lifting weights here. The weight is due to the obvious quality and craftsmanship that was common at onetime before we became a disposable society.</li>
    <li> Very heavy duty, very durable. Nice looking razor as well. Didn&#x27;t care too much for the Derby blades, but that can easily be remedied</li>
    <li> I just wanted to put my $.02 worth in.  I found that when I 1st started doing de shaving the reviews helped, so here is what I have found.  1st, I was using the multi-blade cartridge type razors before I switched over to the double-edged razor.  Like most people I changed over due to the ridiculous expense of the cartridges.  I started out using a Parker 98r butterfly type.  With this I was using a brush that I had which I later found out was a boar bristle.  I was also using the store shaving soap.  The 1st discovery I made was that switching over to a badger bristle brush made a tremendous difference.  I am using the tweezerman brush and it works really well I have not had any significant issues with bristles falling out.  I also have been experimenting with different soaps.  I have used the Taylor of old Bond Street, head slick shavings cream, the gel in the can of different varieties and even regular soap.  As far as blades I have used the shark, Derby extra, feather, Wilkinson and even the drugstore variety.  I tried to give everything a fair evaluation and here is what I have found.  As far as brushes, there is no question that the badger brush works better than the boar bristle.  As far as the blades I find that the Derby extra is the best \\&quot;happy medium\\&quot;.  The feather blades are sharp but don&#x27;t be fooled by some of the reports, you are not going to be performing surgery.  They are sharp but it&#x27;s a razor blade it supposed to be sharp.  As far as the razor, I was not sure if there really would be any difference but I have to say that the Edwin Jagger de89lbl makes a huge difference.  It holds the blade at a better angle and the cut is less aggressive but still does a better job..  I rarely have to use a styptic pencil and the amount of 5 o&#x27;clock shadow is significantly less.  As far as soaps I have found that the head slick shave cream works the best for me.  I do not even mix it in a shaving cup.  I just wet the bristles shake out the excess water and then putabout 2 peas worth on the brush and that&#x27;s enough to do 2 well lathered passes and even the 3rd if you need to.  It is mentholated so if you do not like menthol you might not like this.  If that is the case the Taylor of old Bond Street is a close 2nd.  I have a fairly course beard and I must shave every day.&lt;br /&gt;So for what it&#x27;s worth: Edwin Jagger de89lbl razor, tweezerman badger bristle brush and head slick shaving cream.  This seems to be the best combination for me and if you are looking for your 1st entry into double-edged shaving, I think this would be an excellent starting off point.  Once you get your technique down you will find that double-edged shaving is actually much more gentle to your face than those expensive cartridges and does a better job for a lot less money.</li>
    <li> I have been using this razor for about two weeks now and I have shaved every day except for Sundays. Until two weeks ago I didn&#x27;t think this could be possible. Every time I shaved my skin would get very irritated for a couple of days. I have tried using a straight razor (Dovo Shavette with Fether blades) but I never really learned how to do it without getting nicks or ingrown hairs. It is possible that a heavier straight razor would work better, but I can&#x27;t say for sure. What I can say though is that this safety razor is almost miraculous! I approached the first shave very cautiously, being used to the unforgiving straight razor, but after a few minutes I understood the reason for the word \\&quot;safety\\&quot;. It is almost as easy to use as a modern multi-blade razor. Using the same ultra-sharp Fether blades and Taylor of old bond street cream, I now do three passes: twice with the grain, and once at 45º angle. After doing it the first time I couldn&#x27;t believe I did not have a single cut! Next morning I was ready for another shave and again I got the same results.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if this razor will work for everyone, but as far as I&#x27;m concerned this is a great product. Incredibly simple and beautifully designed.</li>
    <li> I originally passed this razor up due to the short handle.  Shaving your calves with a shorter handled razor sucks.  I did a lot of research and decided to purchase it when people said it was slightly more aggressive than the Merkur 180, which wasn&#x27;t giving me a close enough shave.  I was going through one Feather blade a day, which was getting expensive and silly considering the fact that I wasn&#x27;t satisfied with the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The finish and quality of this razor is a lot nicer than the Merkur 180.  It&#x27;s heavier, despite the handle being an inch shorter.  I was worried about the handle not being textured enough since I shave in the shower, but I didn&#x27;t have any problems with it slipping.  While I was shaving, I realized that the head of this razor is vastly superior to the Merkur.  It delivered a remarkably smooth shave and just felt nicer on my skin.  The Derby blades gave me an acceptable shave, which surprised me, since they had done so poorly in the Merkur for me.  I can&#x27;t wait to experiment with sharper blades to see if I can get a closer shave without using Feathers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the head on this, but I hate the length of the handle.  The Edwin Jagger Chatsworth or a Muhle is probably in my future.</li>
    <li> This is a highly recommended razor. The weight is just proper for the perfect shaving. No pressing guys, just slide it over your skin carefully, NO PRESSING!!! Every day I am enjoying the shaving with this razor and I always make sure to dry it and disassemble it entirely at least once a week and dry it with a microfiber cloth to keep it shiny! Wonderful product. I personally found better blades than the ones that come with the razor, but this is natural, since everyone has a different skin. Therefore you need to buy a variety pack and find the best blade for you. But this is the best razor ever and you do not have to spent more or less money on a razor. This one should last for life if you take care of it! Just spent extra 20 sec to wipe it dry and you will have a true friend for life!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to shaving with a DE razor and decided to purchase the Edwin Jagger DE89.  For the past decade or so, I have used various types of Gillette razors, most recently the Mach 3.  DE shaving offers an economical alternative to the very expensive replacement blades on the market today, especially with Mach 3 blades costing between $3.00-$3.50 / blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Edwin Jagger DE89 is an impressive razor.  It is packaged nicely, has an impressive chrome finish, and has a nice weight.  Many folks recommend the longer handle for folks that are new to DE razors, however, I have found that I prefer the shorter handle.  Loading the blades into this razor is a simple matter of unscrewing the handle.  When properly tightened, I have not had any problems with the handle coming loose during shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The set of 5 Derby blades included with the razor work perfectly for me.  They provide a smooth and consistent shave with little to no irritation.  I have found that when shaving with a single blade, preparation becomes much more important.  Using a proper shaving soap makes all the difference and really helps to improve the glide of the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase and would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for several months and have enjoyed it very much. Works great for me. I even purchased a second razor as a gift for my dad.</li>
    <li> I did my research on this razor and purchased it via Amazon since this model is not available in Singapore. Received it earlier than expected. The razor itself was in good shape. Gives a good close shave with a Croma Diament blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the EJ box was alittle crushed. I had planned to keep the box in mint condition.</li>
    <li> I have purchased two of these razors over the past ~10 months and have been extremely satisfied with the shave they offer; coming from Gilette fusion razors.  My HUGE complaint about this product relates to the quality of metal on metal bonding.  Each of these razors completely broke and rendered themselves unrepairable following ONE drop from face-height onto tile bathroom floor.  I am extremely disappointed in the craftsmanship (despite the shiny chrome exterior), which has resulted in me going through two of these in under a year, nullifying any cost savings vs. sticking with Fusion blades.</li>
    <li> My first double edge razor so I can&#x27;t compare it to others.  I still love it though because it gave me years of good shaves</li>
    <li> This razor worked great for at least 6 months, but then the head fell off for no reason.  I didn&#x27;t drop it or anything.  The part that screwed the head to the base fell apart.  needless to say, I&#x27;m going to find a better razor than this one in the future.</li>
    <li> Very fine razor.  I really enjoy using it.  Elegant and functional.</li>
    <li> Good head. Works better with a heavier handle like Apollo&#x27;s</li>
    <li> Well crafted, precision piece of equipment.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to the double edge razor scene, but after doing some reading I settled on the Edwin Jagger.  I am not disappointed.  This is a great razor.  Balance and weight are great.  In a way, it makes shaving enjoyable not only because the razor works so well, but also because of the inexpensive cost of the blades.  No more 3, 4 or 5 blade razors for me!</li>
    <li> Edwin Jagger has excelled themselves with this razor.  While my first attempt resulted in a couple of nicks and a razor burn, it was due to my lack of experience with this razor....now this my go-to razor for nearly every day.  Nicely weighted, clean looks, mid-range aggressiveness....well done.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor about a year ago and have used it daily since. Iget a very close shave first pass with the grain and then I lather up and go against the the grain. Basicly shaving twice. This razor is quality made material, it looks as new as the day I got it. I clean it once a week with a tooth brush and soap just to get the scum off and see that like new shine.  The razor is  medium agressive, &#x27;they&#x27; say and it&#x27;s plenty agressive for me. It took a few days to get used to using it because I was used to really quickly going over my face with the multi blade, very non-agressive plastic razors which never cut me. So... the very first day I used this one I looked like I&#x27;d just been in a fight with a wild cat. This razor demands you take your time and have a very light touch. I use  Feather blades and Wilkinson Sword and after a year I still can&#x27;t pick a best blade. The are both extremely sharp and both last for several shaves. I will never go back to plastic razors, I just wouldn&#x27;t feel the same about my face and my shave. An excellent razor.</li>
    <li> I received this razor a couple of days ago and opened the box and could tell right away from the feel and look this razor was made solid. It&#x27;s a nice little razor and has some weight to it because it&#x27;s made in England and not by some cheapo Chinese sweat shop. The shave is fantastic!! It is better than I thought it would be. I ordered the Derby blades and it came with some and they are perfect and cut great. Goodbye all you over priced modern blades, because the old boys are back in town and kicking the crude out of you!! I&#x27;m planning on buying another one or even 2 of the same named razors.</li>
    <li> My husband is a hard grader and he gives it 5 stars, must be a good product. Looks good, appears well made, good handle length (For Him), good clean shave.</li>
    <li> I bought the Jagger a few days back and it came with the Derby blades. I must say that it has been one of the few times that I could save on alternate days. The last time I did this was about 16 yrs ago to a disastrous consequence. Well built, grip is nice, fits snug in my palm, heavy head and a neat little bunch of blades.&lt;br /&gt;The only qualms I have are the following:&lt;br /&gt;- The packaging was dull. It came in a cardboard box, with the razor wrapper in paper. A DE razor needs a box/container of its own and I did not see one. For this price I&#x27;d expect a decent presentation&lt;br /&gt;- The razor holds onto the shaving grime. Not sure if it is the water here. Now I just clean the razor thoroughly then wipe it down with a piece of cloth before setting it out to dry&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would still recommend this razor. Make sure NOT to apply any pressure when shaving.</li>
    <li> Very very nice quality! I&#x27;m pretty picky, especially after reading all the reviews of different razors...who woulda thought it could be so complicated. But, I&#x27;m more than happy with this choice. Great feel, finish, and weight.</li>
    <li> Ha! Havent had to buy blades except about every year! $$$$$$$$ saved by switching!</li>
    <li> The build quality on this blade is superb. This was bought as a gift. When the receiver opened it, they were impressed at the construction and feel of it. I myself loved the solid but not too heavy feel and the flawless construction.</li>
    <li> Great construction, simple, elegant, balanced in the hand, and weight makes shaving straightforward. Not too aggressive and the finish is flawless. Made me an EJ return customer. The handle is longer than the Merkur HD.</li>
    <li> Started shaving with the $4 Chinese Special DE razor. Recently upgraded to this Jagger. It is definitely more aggressive than my old razor, but after a week I was much happier using it.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality, perfect chrome finish. Best shave I&#x27;ve had other than a straight razor I got from my old grandpa!</li>
    <li> I have been using this razor for six months now, and it is a fantastic razor! I will never go back to My old twin blade razor.you can get 100 blades from Amazon for about eight dollars! One thing I recommend when you change your blade clean the razor. I just take the towel and wipe it down real good and clean the threads with an old toothbrush and little rubbing alcohol</li>
    <li> It shaves as well as it looks! Not aggressive but capable of bbs  shaves. Using it with Personal blue and Derby blades for an irritation free smooth, non irritating close shave.</li>
    <li> My first time using this razor I was in love. Great shave, great price, excellent quality.  Mark3 turbo my ---. The Durby blades are excellent as well.</li>
    <li> For a wet shaving first timer, this razor is just perfect. If you are scare about how difficult it may be to shave like this don&#x27;t be, its more simple than it looks. This razor is very forgiving compare with others, the blade opening is very narrow which make it harder for you to cut yourself, at the same time make this razor less aggressive but it still cut as close as a disposable. Please get a nice shaving cream you going to same lots of money this the DE blades so don&#x27;t be cheap on the cream, because you need it. Make sure you don&#x27;t let the cream dry on your skin because that make the saving harder specially against the grain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now this razor looks like the most classy item you will ever own, the chrome is so perfect that you will be cleaning it after every shave just to see it shining on the stand, it have a nice weight to it which helps you to shave without applying the pressure you where use to with the disposable. The handle have a perfect size, you will find yourself graving the razor even closer than what the handle offer, all the parts are max quality and the 5 blades that come with the machine are very sharp and will last you up to a month if you shave with warm water and wash your face before each shave section, and please remember at the beginning it will take you a little bit longer to shave so make sure that your cream is a bit tick but also wet, this will allow the razor to glide over your skin very close to the hair and cut without any skin burn etc. Enjoy</li>
    <li> This is a huge step up from my generic 2 piece chinese safety razor. It is very smooth, I barely feel the blade especially with my feather blades. I though it was a mild razor because I didn&#x27;t feel the blade but it gives a close shave with some patience even for my wire beard.</li>
    <li> Very nice chrome. Feels well built, like I could pass this on to my grand kids in 60 years. I was surprised the handle was so short, but after finding out how you have to hold it, makes sense.</li>
    <li> I have a really thick beard so I was tired of the pulling and tugging of the famous mach 3 razors. I was also tired of how expensive mach 3 blades are considering that I can only use them two times before I have to throw them out. After some thinking, I decided to give this safety razor a try and I have to say that it is one of the best choices I&#x27;ve ever made. There is an initial investment that needs to be made when you start shaving with these safety razors (shaving brush, better shaving cream, blades, ect). However, you&#x27;ll soon see that this investment is worth it because you can get 100 quality razors for $25. This has been my first safety razor and it works flawlessly. If you do decided to switch to this type of shaving, make sure you watch some instructional videos on youtube (there are tons of videos on there). Anyway, great safety for an amazing price!</li>
    <li> This is great, over time the savings over buying razors at the store is going to be amazing.  Only reason why I didn&#x27;t rate 5-stars is because it didn&#x27;t really come with instructions on how to unscrew the razor and add in the new blade, which took a couple minutes to figure out.  Also, shave slow.  I cut myself pretty bad the second time using, just be smart, it is a very sharp blade and takes some adjustment after years of shaving with a traditional store bought razor.  I love it though and I can get at least 2 shaves from each side, so I can get 4 shaves off of one blade (and the blades are super low cost).</li>
    <li> smooth shaving its awesome ..reminded me of my father when he use to use it ... thank you so much</li>
    <li> Great razor nice and heavy. However I noticed that the threads weren&#x27;t cut as nicely as my merkur 34c and this led to some difficulty screwing the head to the shaft- it has since worn off although I have noticed this happens on other ej 89 a I&#x27;ve sampled</li>
    <li> This nice razor was everything i could have hoped for and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The included razor blade sat neatly in the razor head and the shaving experience was smooth and uneventful .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a first timer to these &amp;#34;primitive&amp;#34; shaving tools - i can not recommend this razor highly enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s fit and finish, and the hefty weight, of the few parts are confidence inspiring.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this razor. It has a nice heft to it, and glides very nicely without the need to apply further pressure to get it function correctly. It is also easy to take apart to wipe off after use.</li>
    <li> I had been using multiple blades cartridge razor for a long time. Then after watching and reading some reviews about wet shaving and all, I went ahead and ordered this razor. It has been a great shaving experience so far for me. Here are my two cents about this product -&lt;br /&gt;Pros -&lt;br /&gt;1. Beautiful. Great Chrome finish and it just looks great as part of your shaving kit.&lt;br /&gt;2. Good heft to the head. It means that I have practically super smooth shave with minimal effort.&lt;br /&gt;3. Good size. It is not very small but it is good enough to have a proper grip and is easy to be fit into little pockets.&lt;br /&gt;Cons -&lt;br /&gt;1. This is probably the only con so far but it is basically for every non cartridge razor. There is a bit of learning curve here. I cut myself initially a couple of times, but only when I was in a hurry. Once you get accustomed to the weight of the razor, the right amount of pressure you need to apply, the most suited direction to do the shaving, the angles and all it is super smooth sail after that..</li>
    <li> Edwin Jagger makes very comfortable razors however this model has an almost smooth handle, which can be a problem for a tool you will often end up using with wet hands. I have cut myself or almost cut myself several times with this razor when it twisted in my hands while shaving. The razor offers a very comfortable shave if you can get a good grip on it, however you should seek out a model with a more &amp;#34;grippy&amp;#34; handle like the Edwin Jagger Kelvin.</li>
    <li> Make sure you note how this item is assembled before it arrives cuz it wont shave right if you put the bottom plat on backwards.  This is my first de and hardly any learning curve but it will take a few shaves for skin to not pimple after a shave. after a month my shave is so close you cant feel any stubble except right on my chin line. still haven&#x27;t learned how to get that any closer. would buy again.</li>
    <li> This razor is a nice weight. (moderate to heavy) with a good angle on the blade that suits my beard. I am 70 plus and use the gillette 7 o&#x27;clock blades made in Russia with a brush and soap. It is my go to razor among 3 that i have bought.  1 is a designer razor that is relegated to travel. this is the most comfortable with a blade angle and setting that makes for easy cleaning. I had my son shave with it and he bought one the same day.</li>
    <li> I am a person with incredibly sensitive skin and extremely prone to ingrown hairs. Because of this, I have never been able to shave with a non-electric razor consistently, until now. I have been shaving consistently with this razor for a few weeks and have had little to no razor burn. I didn&#x27;t think this was possible and I am very glad I gave this high-quality razor a chance!</li>
    <li> This paired with some feather blades is great. Gives me a clean, close shave.</li>
    <li> I  finally decided I was tired of the expense and poor quality shave of disposable cartridge razors. So, after doing some research, I decided that the safety razor was the way to go.  I set on the Edwin Jagger Double Edge after reading the amazon reviews.  I was not disappointed.  The shave is clean. I would probably give it a medium in aggressiveness.  Excellent choice for a safety razor newbie.  I lost mine in the processing of moving a couple of weeks ago and will be ordering another one.  After being forced to shave with cartridges again for a while I remember exactly why I switched in the first place.</li>
    <li> Good shave which doesn&#x27;t last too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CHECK OUT MY PICTURE ON Customer Images ( on the right side of the page, parallel to the rating chart)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I&#x27;ve been using this razor less than 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The head screw broke into two parts, thanks to the cheap metal it&#x27;s also not repairable by welding or adhesive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Buying a new head cost more than half the price of a new razor. (17 USD)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s very disappointing. now I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve paid so much adding the expensive shipping cost using Amazon Global (for customer outside of the US)</li>
    <li> This is extremely well regarded on various forums and on Amazon. A good price for the only DE razor you will ever need. It is very forgiving and, while enjoyable for the experienced wet-shaver, still forgiving enough for the beginner.</li>
    <li> Beautiful buttery chrome finish, good heft, nice balance. Gives a wonderful close shave. I unpacked the razor as soon as it arrived and installed an old Feather Stainless Steel Platinum Coated blade in it. I say old, about 40 to 50 shaves on it. Lathered up and man was I pleasantly surprised with the comfort and closeness of the shave I received. No nicks either. I really should have bought one of these Edwin Jagger razors a long time ago. For about 30 dollars and install a Feather blade you are good to go. I do fully endorse this razor for anyone who wants a good close and comfortable shave at a lower cost than those baloney multi blade razors that cost a fortune per shave. The Edwin Jagger and Feather blades has them all beat hands down.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed after reading how much better of a shave I would get.&lt;br /&gt;Shaft doesn&#x27;t have a good grip, In fact, it&#x27;s pretty slippy.&lt;br /&gt;Tried this but it did not give me as close a shave as a disposable razor.&lt;br /&gt;It is not comfortable at all, it hurts&lt;br /&gt;I have had to stop using this device because I come away from every use with at least 3 cuts on my face.</li>
    <li> My only issue is that the blade guard is easily damaged.  My wife bumped my razor stand over and the razor fell to the floor and blade guard dented.  A tiny dent, but I kept getting knicks and didnt know why until I noticed it. I complained to my wife that my pricey razor somehow became damaged and she fessed up. I was able to sand the dent off and it works fine again now, but that guard is pretty fragile for the price.</li>
    <li> Feels good but don&#x27;t let it slip out of your hand.  The head snapped off as soon as it hit the floor.</li>
    <li> Good price , good shave, and best of all I&#x27;m shaving for pennies a month now. Good little razor. I bought my son one and he is happy too.</li>
    <li> High quality! My husband and I bought the super cheap ones from hong Kong just to practice with before buying the real thing. If you are new to the &amp;#34;safety razor&amp;#34; world I would suggest buying the &amp;#34;real thing&amp;#34; first!! Sooooo much easier and safer tons have with. I started shaving with just water and sometimes a little bit of oil, I shave everywhere and so far, very smooth with noooo irritation!! I was going to buy a merkur but went with Edwin. Ladies you want a long handled one and men you want a short handled one. My husband and I absolutely love our Edwin Razors!!! And I shave in the shower and because the handled has some grooves in it, it doesn&#x27;t seem slippery to me but I have heard that the completely smooth handles are a bit slippery.</li>
    <li> This great shaving machine nice durable and make big deference when you shave with it</li>
    <li> I wanted it to work, beautifully designed. But my CVS disposable produces better results, especially if it&#x27;s a couple of days between shaves.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t understand why anyone is still paying ridiculous amounts of money to hack their faces up with a Mach 3 and the like.... I&#x27;m 31 and was raised on Mach 3&#x27;s... they even sent me one on my 18th B-day -- So chalk it up to ignorance that it took me this long to switch... I love this edwin jagger razor!  It is a smaller version in my hands but that is what I wanted.  The chrome is excellent and you just have to clean it up from time to time as normal, everyday use occurs.... I don&#x27;t know why people are saying that it is too slippery... whenever the handle gets some water on it I wipe it off with a towel and have not dropped this thing once.... The Derby blades are ok and definitely better than ASTRA blades (which felt like shaving with a dull butter knife)..... they are sharp enough to use twice on my face....  I have already gotten a couple of friends and relatives to switch back to safety razors and you can&#x27;t beat this deal if you are getting started!    ***UPDATE*** I still have this razor and use it every other day or so...... it is working just as well as it was the first day I got it -- I love getting a better shave with this and saving so much money that I can spend on other things.</li>
    <li> Looks great and works well for shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t be happier with my choices.&lt;br /&gt;Simply Beautiful Deluxe Chrome Razor good balance and weight.</li>
    <li> This is much smaller than I thought it would be, but found it helps me be very careful while shaving. I am a recent convert from electric and cartridge razors and will never go back. The construction is very nice. The chrome has no cheap seams or nicks. I wipe it down after shaving and it stays nice and shiny.</li>
    <li> This razor is phenomenal. It&#x27;s my third DE razor, and I have found, for me, the best platform for my DE razors ever. I don&#x27;t know what it is about my face and this razor, but it just works. It&#x27;s got a nice heavy feel and provides me the fewest nicks and cuts on the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten out of a DE system.</li>
    <li> After becoming tired of expensive multi-blade shavers I decided to try shaving the way I learned years ago. I reviewed the different shavers available and ordered the Edwin Jagger De89. I couldn&#x27;t be happier. The shaver is a work of art. The chrome finish is flawless. The size and weight feels great when holding with a wet hand during shaving. Using a shaving brush and soap the razor cut thru a two day beard without cutting my skin. After using the shaver for a few days now I am done with the expensive disposible razors. Cost aside shaving has become a relaxing start to the day.</li>
    <li> Returning to DE shaving after many years of commercial multi-edge blades.  Shaving is a pleasurable experience now!  DE shaving will save your hide.  As a bonus, it costs a LOT less than buying all the latest multi bladed cartridges.  You don&#x27;t need 4 or 5 blades to get a proper shave.  In fact, a double edge (for those who don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s one edge on each side) safety razor will provide a BETTER shave than the latest 5 edge razor and stop all the irritation from shaving.  This Jagger DE89 is a great place to start.  You do need to experiment with blades to get the best combination for you.  I ended up, after trying probably 8 blade brands, with Crystal brand blades.  Most guys don&#x27;t need the super sharp blades from Japan.  The idea is to get a close, but comfortable shave.  Lots of good info online about blade brands and a sharpness scale.  Try some of each starting with the least sharp and see what suits you best!</li>
    <li> OK first thing you should know is All EJ razors use the same head the only difference is in the handle. This head is also identical to any close comb MUHLE head. You can also get this head in a 2 piece design (MUHLE R89 TWIST)  - personally I prefer the EJ Kelvin because not only is it the least expensive but it has the only truly knurled handle. The Kelvin is identical in length and handle diameter to the 34c HD. The nice thing about the 3 piece design is you can find all sorts of handles that will work with it. My favorite is the Icon bulldog. As a first razor or even as a forever razor I would definitely recommend this head paired with your favorite handle. The 34C is an equally good first choice you just need to weigh the pro&#x27;s and cons of the 2 piece vs the 3 piece and shiny vs industrial look. People say the 34c is more aggressive but it&#x27;s so slight that the point is moot.</li>
    <li> This is my first safety razor, and I am beyond impressed. Everything about it is perfect. I used to shave with Gillette Pro Fusion razors and good as those razors may be this Edwin Jagger is even better, more beautiful, and in the long run cheaper. I loaded this razor with Astra Superior Platinum blades and it left me with baby smooth skin. My first pass is with the grain and my second pass is against the grain. I have no doubt that the quality that went into building this razor will last for possibly multiple generations in my family. At about $9 for a box of 100 double edged razors, this will save you a lot of money in the long run compared to other shaving options. Do yourself a favor and orders yours today. Great for men and women.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m not going to write a tome here, but just wanted to say how beautiful this razor is! The fit and finish is amazing.  I&#x27;ve been using (and enjoying!) my Lord L6, but felt like having a second razor.  This is a no-brainer, folks!  I love it.</li>
    <li> This razor seemed like the obvious choice when I bought a DE. Once it arrived and I opened the box I was very impressed in the quality of the chrome plating. It has a very high shine, and is like a mirror on every surface of the razor. It has pretty nice weight too. I think I made a pretty decent purchase. The only downfall to this razor is the same thing other have mentioned; it is a bit slippery if it gets wet, and I don&#x27;t know how one could avoid that. If I decide that I want to try other razors (would like a TTO) then I might keep a knurled handle in mind. Overall very nice DE and the shave was great.  SNIFF-SNIFF sad to report that last week my wife dropped the razor and it broke the stud screw that holds the head to the handle. Over the course of time the razor held up really nice. I am disappointed that it broke. I did not buy another DE89 at this time because I got a long handle Mekur for $20 to try, and then I started thinking about my wife breaking my EJ and decided to get another razor for me. When I bought the EJ I wanted to also try the Merkur 39C slant...well this time I bought it. If it ends up being too much razor for me I will buy the DE89 again. It was a fantastic razor. The fit and finish of the DE89 it WAY better than the Merkur I just bought, but it was only $20. We&#x27;ll see what the slant it like.  It is also nice to see that over 2500 people have bought and reviewed this razor after me. ENJOY! I was also surprised that my smart ass response to a product question about the razor is the #1 voted question. America still has a sense of humor....or some folks get that smart ass vibe I was going for.</li>
    <li> First of all, I love this razor. It&#x27;s a beautiful, well-balanced \\&quot;medium\\&quot; safety razor.  I received it as a gift last December and have been extremely pleased with the performance.  My only problem with the razor is that the chrome-plating on one edge of the the safety head (it&#x27;s a 3-piece construction) has begun chipping.  I have never dropped the razor and clean it after every use.  Since it&#x27;s past the return policy for Amazon I contacted Edwin Jagger (sent pics, described the problem) and am awaiting a response.  Major bummer ... otherwise a rock solid 5-star rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2/20/14:  Edwin Jagger promptly responded, acknowledged the problem and is shipping a replacement part free of charge.  Fantastic customer service.  I&#x27;m changing my rating to 5-stars!</li>
    <li> This is my first DE razor, and I love it. Great quality and good weight. it takes time to get used to but after a few weeks I&#x27;m no longer nicking my neck and my razor burn has gotten better.</li>
    <li> This is a well made, perfectly balanced razor with a gorgeous finish &amp; it gives a great shave.  The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about it was the handle seemed slippery when wet, even though I had the lined version.</li>
    <li> I cannot wait to shave with this razor. I use it everyday and look forward to shaving. Razor is great quality and I get a close shave.</li>
    <li> Nice heft well balanced and shaves well the handle could slightly longer. Beautiful chrome finish made in the UK. The blades supplied with the razor are substandard do yourself a favor and purchase USA manufactured Personna blades. They work much better.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe , it&#x27;s been 18 years since I last Shaved with a safety razor ,, got caught up in this 3,4,5 8,9... blade razor crap which also costs A lot of $$$ . I purchased the Edwin Jagger ,, what a beautiful piece ,solid ,looks like fine art. Unbelievable shave WoW , so smooth easy ,and best of all Blades are great price .</li>
    <li> This was my first de razer and it has been a very forgiving razor for a rookie like me.  Its very easy to learn with and to use on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> Feels good in my hand, it does take experience to get the shave right and I&#x27;m still working on it.  If you think you&#x27;ll get it right the first time? You must be perfect at everything you do when you start.  Just Saying! everything including shaving with a safety razor takes time.  I love how quick, smooth and inexpensive this shave is!</li>
    <li> I have shaved for many years with various gadgets from the double edge, to electric and then to the latest 2-5 blade alleged wonders. When I think back about all the money spent and present cost of the multi blades it was worth a try going back to double edge. The razor is excellent  and the Derby blades are sharp enough for my beard to give me 4 shaves a blade. Take into account the cost of 200 blades for 15 dollars and it gives you some idea when I look at 8 multi razor blades selling for 30 dollars. So far no nicks over the last two months and also a return to brush and soap. Shaving has become a pleasure again. My thanks to all the previous writers who recommended switching back to the &amp;#34;old days&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> If anyone has any doubts about which DE razor to buy and use, particularly if you are new to DE shaving, go to You Tube abd search &amp;#34;geofatboy...Edwin Jagger DE89&amp;#34;. Geofatboy has about 50 awesome shaving videos and he has his own website where he sells shaving gear and supplies. I&#x27;ve watched about 15 of his videos and he&#x27;s the kind of guy you would want as a friend. He does a review of the Jagger DE89 and is practically giggling he likes it so much. Watch it, buy it, love it.</li>
    <li> I bought this mainly out of curiosity and my disdain for the price of Mach 3 cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;D/E razors are used differently, you don&#x27;t press down as you shave, you let the heft of the razor due the work. The heads don&#x27;t pivot, so you need to change the angle with your hand.  It takes just a little practice, and gives a very close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; If you want to be more green and save money, I would highly recommend these.  I use maybe two blades a month.  Blades sell for anywhere from 10 to 30 cents per blade, much cheaper than Gillette or Schick cartridges in your local grocery store.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used a safety razor in decade&#x27;s and since I&#x27;m on a fixed income now, I&#x27;ve been using the cheap disposable two blade plastic razors. I had some bonus points from a credit card so I put them toward this and accessories..I just got the set, razor, stand, brush, and some Old Eton shaving cream today and a pack of 100 Derby blades. Compared to what I&#x27;ve been using and what I used in the far past, this set up is great. I kind of gambled on the Derby blades because reputedly they aren&#x27;t as sharp as the Feather&#x27;s..I just got back from the store with a septic pencil. I had a few bumps and things that are no longer there. Like the videos said I just used the weight of razor and gave me a much smoother shave than what I&#x27;ve been getting. I&#x27;ve got some learning to do but not much. I need to work on the correct angle for my neck. The razor cleaned up nicely with hot water. I thought briefly about getting more shaves out of Derby blades by dropping then in mineral oil, but at ten cents a blade it is not worth the mess and the bother.</li>
    <li> Nice razor, well constructed and sturdy feeling. Handle is a little slippery  when your hands are wet but not that big of an issue. It really does give a mild shave, maybe to mild for me. As a first razor its not bad but I think I would prefer a more aggressive shave than it provides. Nice chrome finish and balance.  Updated information March 25, 2015...... After one month of use and like some others I dropped this razor and broke the head screw off in the handle. I emailed Edwin Jagger and am pleased to say that they are mailing me a new replacement. This was unexpected as it was my fault it broke. Now that&#x27;s wonderful customer service.</li>
    <li> Wonderful finely made shaver gets the shaver angle right every time not like my prior Chinese made blood sacrifice unit</li>
    <li> I tried this for a week and returned it.  I went back to my Gillette Fusion cartridges.  Yes, the Edwin Jagger shaver is a nice instrument, well made, etc., but I didn&#x27;t have the patience to learn how to use it well, put up with all the shaving nicks, and figure out which blades, brushes, and shaving cream to buy,  The cartridge system is just so much easier, and I really like the trimmer blade for shaving my side burns and upper lip.  The cartridge blades last a lot longer - I get a month out of them, so the cost over a year is not out of line (14 cartridges for $50 at Costco).  Yes, the vintage car is nice to look at as long as someone else owns it, but I&#x27;ll take the 2015 model, thank you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for over a month and I am very pleased with how it shaves. I had this razor  [[ASIN:B0019LSBGO B0019LSBGO]] and it never seemed to hold the blade very well, it often felt like it was dragging across my face. Not so with this razor, I rarely cut myself and get a great shave every time</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t find this razor to provide as close a shave as a similar Merkur.  It is well made and feels well balanced in the hand, but I find that it does not provide as close a shave as I like.  Shaving is all about personal taste, but this one didn&#x27;t work for me.  Others do find it be a great razor, so take my review for what it&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> Excellent razor. Best shave iv ever had. It doesn&#x27;t get more manly then this either. Back to the primal days.&lt;br /&gt;I reserched safety razors before I commited to buying one. So glad I did. I use to use Gillette Fussion and and expencive philips electric razor. so glad i swiched! Going to save alot of money in the long run too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a female user - and simply love the way it gives me a nice close shave on my legs.  The only thing that I don&#x27;t like is having to take it apart to clean and dry it.  My last razor simply had a twist of the handle and the top opened so that I could pop the blade out, dry it or replace it.  So this takes a bit more time - but so far, I&#x27;ve found it to be well worth the investment.</li>
    <li> Very well made and durable. A bit heavier than I am used to but I have found that to my liking. Best that I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> Remembering my Father used this kind of razor, I decided to buy one to see if it would give me a better shave than the disposables and cartridge devices I&#x27;ve been using,  Using this razor makes me appreciate the disposables and expensive, modern blades.  This is a different shaving experience.  With a disposable I don&#x27;t have to think about how fast I&#x27;m shaving or what angle I&#x27;m using.  It&#x27;s very fast and effortless.  Using a safety razor is very different.  You can&#x27;t be in a hurry.  You have to think about what you&#x27;re doing.  It&#x27;s more touchy.  More like an art.  More skill needed.  I can&#x27;t say I cut myself more, but you have to go slow.  The instructions indicate not to shave against the direction of the beard growth.  But if you don&#x27;t shave against the direction you don&#x27;t get as close of a shave.  I find myself &amp;#34;finishing&amp;#34; myself with a cartridge razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a &amp;#34;newbie&amp;#34; at this.  I&#x27;m going to give it a go for a month more.  Maybe I&#x27;ll get used to it and figure it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought some traditional shave cream from The Art of Shaving with the razor and I&#x27;m totally taken by it.  The stuff is much &amp;#34;oilier&amp;#34; than Barbasol or any other shaving cream or gel.  Your face is really slippery when using it.  And it stays slippery even after two or three passes of the razor.  I will continue to use this stuff and I recommend it whether you use a safety razor or disposable.</li>
    <li> the unit is  heavy, hard to move in difficult shaving areas. It came in a card board carton, shown in a nice solid case.  I got taken again !!!</li>
    <li> good balanced handle and not slick when it is wet. Assembles very quickly and the chrome seems to be good quality. The Derby blades might not be sharpest, but they re good learning blades. Have not cut myself once in about two weeks of shaving.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving for over 36 years and have never shaved with a safety razor.  I read all the reviews on this product and bought the razor.  It came last night and I shaved with it this morning.  I love the weight and fee of this razor the product quality is superb.  I got one nick on my chin that is user error not product error.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to shave old school like your dad or grand dad did in the past.</li>
    <li> Got it today had my first shave with it tonight.very impressed with this razor, gave a close shave with no razor burn,the chrome plating  looks good ,very well made.would definitely buy again. I Think I like it  better than my merkur long handle .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m relatively new to the wet shaving experience.  I have already tried a few &amp;#34;cheap-o&amp;#34; Twist to open safety razors.  They work well enough but not exactly comfortable.  I tried this razor for the first time last night and it was amazing.  a very mild shave with a &amp;#34;trig&amp;#34; blade.  super close shave, but very very gentle on my face.  I definitely recommend to every wet shaver out there!</li>
    <li> Even though I&#x27;m new to DE razors and the wet shaving process. I have to say this razor is great. Looks great and feels very good in my hand. Doesn&#x27;t slip and is heavy enough to make the shaving easier.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving with various kinds of safety razors for many years. I migrated from PAL single edge to Gillette Double Edge to Atra and Fusion and all of those expensive trendy things, and a couple of years ago returned to the double edge safety razor, using a generic with the &amp;#34;butterfly&amp;#34; mechanism. I decided to move up and chose the Jagger, and it is a winner. Heavy with good balance, well-crafted, and because the head screws off rather than butterfly-ing, there is more precision. Absolutely the best shave I have ever had. It comes with Derby blades, which are very good, but I prefer the Wilkinsons. One warning: pay attention when you take it apart. It is easy to reassemble the head upside down... it will look &amp;#34;correct&amp;#34; but you will be unable to shave with it. I suspect that is the intention for when you are packing it for travel. But this is a great razor, close shave, well-made and it cleans up easily.</li>
    <li> This razor uses the same head as the the Muhle R89, but cost much less.  This is a beautiful razor which gives an excellent non-aggressive yet close shave.  I found it performs well with virtually any blade, from a super sharp Feather to the tame but still excellent Derby.  I rotate the EJ as part of my 3 razor system and load it with either a Derby or Astra blade.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a month now and really like this razor. I decided to try wet shaving again after my electric razor needing replacing. I have used wet razors in the past but this is my first DE razor. I was somewhat hesitant at first, but after using it a couple of time and getting used to it, I have been using this every day and really enjoy shaving again.</li>
    <li> It has been many years since shaving with a safety razor, having been shaving with those multiple blade, i.e. empty your wallet varieties. I am using the Derby blades that came with the shaver but ordered the Feather blades as a replacement. The Derby are somewhat irritating but give a close shave. The razor looks like a bumper that has been custom chromed for a show car. Beyond my expectations and will recommend the Jagger to friends wishing to keep some money in their pocket.</li>
    <li> Works well and the shave is close.</li>
    <li> After using a TTO butterfly razor i became unhappy with how the blade would not always sit straight in the razor. With the Edwin Jagger this is never a problem. The way this beautifully chromed razor holds the blade is perfect and at just the right angle. The three prongs coming out of the top section of the head fit inside the razor blade snugly ensuring the blade is in exactly the same place every time. A true precision instrument.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weight and size of the Razor is perfect and the chrome finish is absolutely flawless on every facet of each piece. I heard great things about the Derby razor blades that came with them but was not terribly impressed. Even though i showered first and worked up a good lather they still dragged a bit. I put in one of my trusty Astra Platinum&#x27;s and man what a shave! I prefer the Astras also because they are not packaged in little plastic boxes like the Derby&#x27;s. One reason i switched from cartridge razors to DE was concern for the environment with all plastic you are creating using cartridges.</li>
    <li> I only got into &amp;#34;gourmet shaving&amp;#34; a month or so ago, and after visiting several message boards, decided to buy the EJ De89lbl.  It was a great choice!  This is one nifty little razor - well-made, perfectly balanced, and just plain attractive.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever need to upgrade.  This one feels like the only DE I&#x27;ll ever need.</li>
    <li> A dangerous tool! I have had to stop using this device because I come away from every use with at least 3 major cuts on my face.</li>
    <li> Excellent, excellent razor.  First double-edged razor I have used in decades and now am back in the &amp;#34;D.E.&amp;#34; camp of shaving.  Very nice, perfect chrome finish, simple, sturdy operation.  You cannot go wrong with this shaving razor.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after getting tired of purchasing the ridiculously expensive electric shaving heads and disposable razors.  I HIGHLY doubt that I&#x27;ll ever switch back.  I&#x27;m extremely glad I purchased this razor.  It&#x27;s definitely made to last a lifetime.  A nice solid heavy handle with a good grip that doesn&#x27;t slip out of your hands when wet.  The Derby blades work great too!  It&#x27;s just amazing looking at how much money you&#x27;ll save, considering that you can get about 100 double edge blades for around $10 on Amazon!  Also, think about how much you&#x27;re saving the environment.  There&#x27;s tons of plastic that goes into the packaging of the disposable razors and the razors are even made of plastic themselves!  Not to mention the shaving cream in a can.  The plastic is getting thrown out and the chemicals in the can are getting rinsed down the drain.  Here, you&#x27;re recycling a VERY THIN blade and if you purchase a bar soap and a brush, all you&#x27;re rinsing down the drain is natural soap.  One last point that somewhat confuses me, I see many reviews (on this and many other different Double Edge Razors) that people are complaining that they&#x27;re too sharp or that their faces are getting cut up.  I&#x27;m 20 years old and have been using this razor for a few months now.  I haven&#x27;t had that problem at all.  It&#x27;s not a race to shave, you&#x27;re supposed to take your time and pay attention to detail.  If you want a quick 15 second shave, this isn&#x27;t for you.  If you want to shave the right way, this is for you.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this shaver.  He says it is the best shave he has ever had. Close shave and the blades cost almost nothing compared to the ones you buy in the store.</li>
    <li> This is one of the finest quality products I have ever bought. Well worth the money. This razor along with &amp;#34;Crystal&amp;#34; blades, a SimplyBeautiful&amp;#34; Badger hair brush and &amp;#34;Taylor of Old Bond Street&amp;#34; sandalwood shave cream have given me the closest and most comfortable shave I have ever had.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband&#x27;s birthday, and it is beautiful, well constructed, and works great.  Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed.  I was just getting the hang of shaving with this razor and I was enjoying it, but I accidentally dropped it into my sink (full of water) and the head broke off. I will be replacing it with a different brand.</li>
    <li> I have been using this razor for a month now and I love it. I use a good quality shaving brush and shaving cream. I nicked myself the first couple of times I used this razor, but I chalk that up as a learning experience as this was my first safety razor. It&#x27;s a great feeling using hot water to heat up the cutting head and shaving with it. the razor has a nice heft to it and makes modern razors seem light weight.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve done the traditional multi-edge disposable razor shaving and have used an electric shaver. Disposables work fine, but are expensive in the long run. Electric shaver got a really close shave, but irritated my neck a lot. This razor has been great. It gets as close as a disposable, 4-5 blade razor and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my neck. The handle is the perfect length and the weight of the razor is nice; feels really solid. I recommend trying a few different brands/types of DE razor blades. I tried Astra and Derby, and ended up liking the Derby blades more. Loving DE shaving so far, and loving this razor.</li>
    <li> I like this razor which is one of three that I use. What I don&#x27;t like about it is lining up the handle to to top which has to be screwed in. It takes a few times to line up. Otherwise it handles well and has a nice weight to it for handling.&lt;br /&gt;ric</li>
    <li> Really likes this razor.  Hasn&#x27;t found one like it before and has tried a few in the past years.  Works very well</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t know much about Edwin Jagger, he was a blacksmith from Netherlands who hunted, pillaged and burned villages in order to find the best steel possible.  No steel was good enough for his idea of a safety razor so he had to kill the only man he trusted, his brother Logan.  Logan had adamantium in his body and Edwin extracted it in order to craft the finest razor known to man.  it&#x27;s built to last, Jagger Last!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a poor combination of a thick and fast growing beard but very sensitive skin.  This safety razor gives me the absolute best shaves I&#x27;ve had and that&#x27;s the bottom line!</li>
    <li> Why didn&#x27;t I switched to a traditional DE razor earlier!!  this razor with Wilkinson sword blades cannot be beaten. The heft of the razor results in a closer shave in comparison with disposables and you could cool it down or warm it up to your liking with tap water for the ultimate shaving experience. It does not take longer including disassembling, washing, drying and putting it together, which I do in a minute.. This particular EJ is a piece of art.. meticulously crafted so that either side is perfect. The chrome job is spectacular and the lined detail of this particular model is very handsome. It hangs upside-down for drying in a standard shaving stand. I myself got me a West Coast Shaving stand with 30mm opening at the brush side for oversized shaving brush, such as Proraso or Omega Pro 48 (same item pretty much)..</li>
    <li> Would have preferred a slightly longer handle but it&#x27;s my fault I didn&#x27;t read the description more thoroughly. I will use it until I lose it or it breaks.</li>
    <li> All my life I have used disposable razors. I switched to this DE safety razor and I am very happy. They are not as difficult to use as you might think or have heard.This is a nice well made razor. I am impressed. The Derby blades did very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure the blade is in properly and handle is tight.&lt;br /&gt;I use a cheap shaving cream in a can&lt;br /&gt;Slow and steady no hurry short strokes&lt;br /&gt;Rinse under running water frequently (using warm to hot water causes razor to warm up which is nice)&lt;br /&gt;Clean when done&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty simple</li>
    <li> First safety razor I have ever owned, gives me a nice shave, bet I&#x27;ve saved over a hundred bucks already.  I find I prefer the Wilkenson blades but they are so cheap you can try a bunch for a couple of bucks.  I wonder if I could buy a car with the money I have wasted over the years.</li>
    <li> I waited on reviewing the EJ De89lb but after a few months I have to say it&#x27;s a great razor. The chrome is deep, the construction is solid, and I have had zero issues. This was my first DE razor purchase so I can&#x27;t really compare it to any other but so far it has been great! If you&#x27;re interested (and a newbie like me) give it shot!</li>
    <li> I had forgotten how good a safety razor&#x27;s shave was.  It requires more preparation, but the results are better than any modern multibladed shave.  Once you get used to the prep, you will enjoy the results.</li>
    <li> This Safety Razor is not as flashy and mechanically interesting as some others I have looked at.  Eh... whatever. It works very well. I find it very easy to use and it has a nice heft. The chrome and polish are all I could ask for. It rinses clean in seconds. Removing the handle to change the blade is not difficult at all. No more than removing the cap on a tube of toothpaste. I would like a top loader with a long handle one day. My dad had one I used to admire as a kid. I will keep this one too. It&#x27;s a winner.</li>
    <li> This is my first safety razor and I have been very pleased with it.  Having nothing to compare it to, the most I can say is that once you learn to use it properly, this razor provides a great shave.  If you haven&#x27;t used a safety razor to start, this has been a good product for me to learn with.  It&#x27;s also nice that it comes with a few replacement blades to get you started - I&#x27;m not sure how many other safety razors will come with a set of extra blades.</li>
    <li> I loved it at first, however after a week, I noticed it didn&#x27;t work. It turns out the center plate is very easy to bend if you happen to over tighten the handle. Very week metal, and so, I moved to a above the tie stainless steel slant razor. This and just about every other sub 100 razor is made with cheap pot metal and a chrome overlay.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Edwin Jagger DE based on the generally positive reviews here on Amazon as well as various shave sites. The price was also a contributing factor. The combination of this razor with the included Derby blades are a great combination. The weight and size of the razor are perfect, in my opinion. The Derbys are a good starter blade that I would purchase in the future.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried different blades since purchase and each brand definitely has their characteristics and &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34;. For my personal taste, I like this razor with Feathers, Gillette 7o&#x27;clocks and Derbys. Each person is different so your preferences will vary. My only minor gripe is that it didn&#x27;t come with a razor stand like my EJ badger brush did. It&#x27;s not a deal breaker, but would&#x27;ve been nice.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this was a great purchase and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> This was my first safety razor and I fell in love with it as soon as I took it out of the box.Great razor!!</li>
    <li> Razor works great, well constructed. My hand cramps a little from trying to hold the tiny handle so I may switch out to a longer handle version of this razor.</li>
    <li> I look forward to the daily shave with my De89lbl.  Edwin Jagger transforms &amp;#34;the shave&amp;#34; into an anticipated experience.  This razor tames the more aggressive DE blades - Feather, Sword, etc. and delivers a great shave every time.  Unless you have very large hands, would recommend the De89lbl as it feels perfectly balanced and just the right size.  This is a golden product in a stainless steel wrapper.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
    <li> I should have bought this razor a long time ago.  From the first time using it, I got a great shave.  Since then, I&#x27;ve thrown away all of my old cartridge razors/handles.  This razor is well made, well balanced, and looks good.  No more cartridge razors for me again!</li>
    <li> My husband just switched to a safety razor.  At first he wasn&#x27;t sure if he liked it.  He had been using a Braun for so many years.  That was fine until he turned 38.  His hair became very coarse.  My husband would shave at 7am and by noon he would have a shadow.  Now with this razor he is still pretty smooth at 9pm. This razor is nearly perfect and he has adjusted well to it.  Super clean shave.  Apply no additional pressure to avoid accidental cuts.  Nice and heavy.  Handle is a nice length too.  Super shiny chrome.  I also purchased the Van Der Hagen Premium Shave Set (Soap, Bowl , Brush) and it works great with this razor.  Highly recommend both for a gift set.</li>
    <li> These blades met my expectations and are a great value. I would recommend these if you are going back to the razor shaving method like I did.</li>
    <li> an emotional kick too. reminds of my boyhood when I used to watch my dad shave with this type of razor plus special soap and brush.</li>
    <li> I bought this just a few weeks ago and so far I love it.  Its not my only razor as it does not do well when I am late for work and needing to shave in a hurry.  In that type of scenario it is a bad choice.  It also does not shave my head as easily as others.  But for just a relaxing, enjoyable facial shave it does the job excellently!    It does take a little time to get used to the new way to shave that this requires as it doesnt do long strokes but lots of little short strokes.  Which is fine by me.  It is easy to disassemble and clean the individual parts and to replace blades as well.  Lastly, it just looks great!    Overall, Im very pleased with this razor and am so far also pleased with the derby blades it came with.  4/5      Update:  Nov 12, 2014    I have been using this razor now for about 2 months to shave my head.  It does a decent job now that I have figured out the right way to hold the razor above and behind my head.  With that said, that only works going with the grain.  Going against the grain is just about impossible without spilling a lot of blood.  I know the razor is only a part of this, but I use Derby blades which are relatively dull and Cremo Cream with very hot water so that is not the issue.      I also noticed my hand gets tired after about 15 minutes of shaving.  I believe a more well designed grip would have really alleviated that.  For these deficiencies I am bringing my rating down to 3 stars.</li>
    <li> After about 15 years of spending ridiculous amounts of money on men&#x27;s shaving products I thought I would give the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; safety razor a try. I am SO glad I did. After reading a ton of reviews about the learning curve associated with the use of a safety razor, I was worried that I was basically going to have to learn to shave again. This was not the case. I ordered the Edwin Jagger De89lbl and was very pleased when I initially received it. The chrome plating was flawless and the weight of the razor was great. I could tell I wasn&#x27;t holding something cheap that was going to have to be replaced in 6 months. In fact, with proper care, I expect this will last me my lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;Now for the dreaded learning curve... I shaved with the Jagger the morning after I got it expecting the worst; I had a role of TP standing by to shore up all the nicks I was expecting as a result of learning how to use a new razor. To my surprise, not a single nick! I&#x27;ve used it now over 10 times and have yet to cut myself. In fact, when you run the Jagger across your face the balance and weight of it creates the perfect shaving pressure and it is very easy to sense and adjust to the correct blade angle while you shave.&lt;br /&gt;THE BOTTOM LINE: If you are on the fence about trying out a safety razor and are worried about the learning curve, don&#x27;t be. And for the amount of money you will save over a lifetime of shaving, this one is a no-brainer (replacement safety razors are around 10 cents each depending on what brand you go with). I was glad I went for it and I think you will be too.</li>
    <li> Takes some getting used to from traditional razors. I&#x27;ve had this razor for about 8 months. It has held up great and replacement razors are very inexpensive. I love using this razor</li>
    <li> The stainless steel coating lasted about 12 shaves before peeling off at the head.  Very dissapointed as it appears others have had decent experiences with this.</li>
    <li> I just received mine today. My routine (with a Gillette Fusion razor) involved a brush and shaving soap anyway, so no big shift there. The difference is the razor. I just gave myself the closest shave I have ever gotten outside a barber shop with an old dude and a straight razor. No razor burn, no irritation. I&#x27;m going to try a sampler of blades to see if it can get even better. I have quite literally thrown away my Gillette. Lord, I&#x27;ve wasted so much money on cartridges...</li>
    <li> BEST SHAVE I HAVE EVER HAD!  I am new to this style of shaving so there was a learning curve (DO not use any pressure), but after putting time into it I am sold for life.  I will add an update to this in the next couple months.  I have used this Razor for 8 Months.  Yesterday it fell out of the stand and into the sink (8 inches).  Sadly the head snapped off.  I  would think a few inch fall would not snap the head off.  The shave this gives may be the best I have ever gotten from any razor.  The issue it is it seems rather brittle.  I would give the shave 5 stars.  Durability however I give 1 star And sadly you look for quality and durability on a product like this.</li>
    <li> It is a beautiful to look at. This my first DE shaver. I get an excellent shave with this razor.</li>
    <li> I am relatively new to DE razors and purchased a Van Der Hagen a couple of months ago.  It is a low priced razor, but I really liked the results from it. So, being hooked on DE razors, I started researching higher quality razors and came across the Edwin Jagger DE89. The quality build of this razor exceeded my expectations. The quality of the shaves it gives easily exceeds my old fusion razor. I have not nicked or cut myself once and no longer have skin irritation on my neck. Don&#x27;t put any pressure on the razor when using it. Let the weight of the razor do the work for you. Shaving with this razor takes me maybe a minute longer than my fusion razor and I use shaving cream out of a can. So, my daily routine in the morning is no different than before. I&#x27;m using personna blades that I paid $14 for a 100 pack and that has greatly reduced my cost compared to the fusion blades. I get one week of shaves out of one blade. The only complaint I have is a minor one and it&#x27;s with the 3 piece design. Unlike a fusion, quattro, mach 3, etc..., youhave to pay attention to how you&#x27;re holding the razor when changing blades. This razor is well made and good for anyone new to DE or experienced and looking for a quality DE razor.</li>
    <li> Slippery handle!!! I often shave in the shower and when I received the razor I noticed how round and smooth the handle was and when I checked it with damp hands it was way too slippery to be used safely. I can&#x27;t speak to shave quality, never got that far.  Nice looking though.</li>
    <li> Never cuts and gets a pretty close shave. I like the weight of it and the stainless steel is attractive to the eyes.</li>
    <li> Hadn&#x27;t used one of these in a long time. Being sixty six years old, and having shaved for ever, my old beard is tough. So I sometime have to shave twice to come clean. But I did the with multiple blades too.&lt;br /&gt;This one does a fine job for me. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have been wet-shaving for years using my father&#x27;s thirty-year-old Gillette safety razor and decided to purchase my own razor to leave as an heirloom one day. I had not heard of EJ razors before spotting them on Amazon, so I researched them on various online forums and decided to give it a try. I am very glad I did. The razor is noticeably heavier than the Gillette, which is a good thing as it requires less pressure when shaving. The razor is very well-made: the three parts fit together tightly; the blade is at a relatively normal angle (not too aggressive); and the chrome is finished evenly and highly-polished. The razor is easily cleaned with a bit of rubbing alcohol and an old tooth brush once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The provided Derby blades are of varying quality. To be fair, five blades is a small sample, but of the four I used, two were fine and two were very rough. I switched back to the cheap Walgreen&#x27;s brand and have had consistent shaves. Don&#x27;t let the Derby blades be the deciding factor though; this razor is a good product that I would recommend to a friend. It appears that it will last for decades.</li>
    <li> My husband loved it! Will be buying more!</li>
    <li> This Edwin Jagger razor has made shaving something more than a boring routine.  Since it is my first &amp;#34;safety&amp;#34; razor, I can&#x27;t really rate it in comparison to similar items.  However, the experience of shaving with a hefty, well-made instrument is far superior to that of a piece of stamped plastic.  The shave itself is very close, and most-importantly I am happy to report that it is just as simple, straight-forward, safe, and nick free as with any disposable that I have used.  It was no trouble at all to make the adjustment to a &amp;#34;genuine&amp;#34; safety razor.  This Edwin Jagger razor is a FINE piece of equipment.</li>
    <li> This is my first DE razor and found it to be very well built. I love the crome finish. I highly recommend this to anyone considering a DE razor.</li>
    <li> This is simple and affordable. I&#x27;ve dropped it a dozen times on accident and it did not break. I&#x27;d buy another one without hesitation.</li>
    <li> Had this razor about a year and a half. Gave a great shave until tonight when the head just broke clean off. Came here to review and saw several others have had the same problem. This is inexcusable</li>
    <li> I love this razor and it is the first double edge and I really enjoy shaving now, the only the thing it is hard to find the blades</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have much else to add to the reviews of this great razor other than to make sure to have the blade put in correctly. The top and bottom pieces of the guard, or the part that sandwiches the blade, should both curve inward (toward the blade). They will grip the blade firmly when you screw in the handle, so you don&#x27;t get any razor wobble. Otherwise you&#x27;ll carve your face up. That may sound self-evident to you experienced wet shavers, but if you&#x27;ve never really messed around with a classic-style safety razor, like I hadn&#x27;t, then it may not be immediately obvious how it&#x27;s supposed to go together. Hope this helps another novice.</li>
    <li> No worries here: just a top notch safety razor  with no issues. Heavy construction and well designed. I just got tired of the high priced disposables and thought, why not get a proven, high quality old fashioned safety razor? Just remember to keep the razor  packs out of the reach of children.</li>
    <li> I was looking at the Merkur razor, but everyone kept saying it was unforgiving man&#x27;s razor.  When I looked over the reviews of the Jagger I saw that it had a longer handle, good weight, and was a forgiving razor.  As a newbie to safety razors it was important to me.  It&#x27;s a beautiful razor which works great.  Great weight and nice handle length make it a dream to use.</li>
    <li> This is my first double edge safety razor, so take the review with a grain of salt.  First, what I&#x27;m not crazy about:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Handle is fairly short&lt;br /&gt;* I&#x27;d rather not have to disassemble the razor every time I change blades&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However there&#x27;s plenty more I like about it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It costs about the same as a 12 pack of Gillette Fusion cartridges&lt;br /&gt;* Solidly built, has a nice feel in your hands&lt;br /&gt;* Angles the blades just right for a nice smooth shave&lt;br /&gt;* It&#x27;s pretty compact so traveling with it is not a problem.</li>
    <li> This is the first DE razor I ever bought and after a few years of use it may not be as shiny, but it is still a fantastic razor.&lt;br /&gt;Hats off to Jagger.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been pretty happy with this razor and it is pretty well made. It is sturdy and has a good weight to it. The one I received can occasionally be tricky to screw the handle into the head as it has a tendency to grab the threads incorrectly.  Up until now I&#x27;ve been very happy with the razor however it had a decapitating fall onto the tile floor and the threaded part of the head sheared off in the handle. So do handle it gingerly over hard surfaces.  I&#x27;m debating now whether or not to rebuy or try a different brand.</li>
    <li> Got it for bf as a valentine&#x27;s gift.  Looks very pretty, solid built, easy to use.  He is still using the free blades that came with it.  Gets a pretty smooth shave, his faces feels so silky and he doesnt break out or get ingrown hairs.  Would totally recommend.  Im considering getting the female version to shave in the shower.</li>
    <li> Nicely machined &amp; finished with a nice heft in the hand. The handle is good sized but can become slippery.&lt;br /&gt; The chrome is well plated &amp; the razor gives a close, long lasting shave.</li>
    <li> Very happy with my purchase. My first safety razor, after a few shaves I get a very good shave, very easily with it. Built solidly, seems very sturdy, no complaints at all.</li>
    <li> I had fooled around years ago with my dad&#x27;s old de and nicked myself to pieces. This razor is Awsome. Don&#x27;t  let some of the reviews scare you. You can&#x27;t even feel this razor shaving but it does a great job. No more multi blades for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been very happy with this shaver so far. It&#x27;s got a nice weight and hand feel, hasn&#x27;t begun to rust anywhere, and has taken several falls without showing any signs of wear.</li>
    <li> Update after 1 year: The razor provides a great shave with the right blade: Astra SP, Gillette Super Blue, Personna to name a few. I have two concerns: 1) don&#x27;t drop it. After reading many posts the head can break if dropped. Thankfully I have been  lucky so far and it hasn&#x27;t hit the floor - yet. 2) The handle is a bit slippery when wet. The vintage Gillettes and the Feather AS-D2 provide a more secure grip. One tip is to rub some shaving Alum on your fingers before you shave as this will increase your grip. It really does help. When using the Alum I will still give it 5 stars. Without Alum, 4 stars.  This is a real piece of art - beautifully engineered and chromed. No defects. it has a really nice balance to it and shaves beautifully. I do have to say it appears small when unpacking but the short handle is not a problem fo rme. I was concenred about the three piece assembly but it is no big deal at all. All parts are beautifully engineered and chromed, which impressed me. The parts fit solidly together and so far I have tried over a dozen different blades and all fit perfectly. Easy to clean and I use the hand blower in the gym to dry it every day. Very little maintenance. A very, very nice product.</li>
    <li> Like many other reviewers, I was pleasantly surprised at the effectiveness of a single edge razor. The one disappointment is that the ribs are vertical instead of horizontal as on my Gillette razor. My shaving habit is to dispense shaving cream into my right hand, spread it around my face, leaving some on my right hand for later touch-up. But the razor is too slippery for this, and the ribs do not help. Still, a great value.</li>
    <li> An excellent quality razor which gives a very close and comfortable shave.  I had apprehensions about going back to a safety razor after all my years of plastic and multi blades, but found the transition back to &amp;#34;where I started&amp;#34; in shaving was easy.  I have gotten few nicks in the re-learning process - little worse than multi-blade shaving.  The best news is that there is absolutely no problem in squaring off sideburns or getting up close under your nose.  These were a major problem with all the multi blade gizmos that I tried over the years.  I can now shave for a year (figuring 3-4 shaves per blade) for about what 1 four-pack refill costs in the four or five blade jobs.  That is a major savings.</li>
    <li> Short and Sweet. As i am 60 yrs of age, you may expect ive tried a lot of shavers, and over the yrs ive accumulated a few bumps and scars, nonetheless, i was frustrated with desposables etc., i enjoy a good close shave, i do have a stache and soul patch, yes it takes a little more time to navigate, but its enjoyable. I enjoy the traditional shave. This razor is extremely well made, i like the weight and feel, and it looks good. It was packaged well and the Derby blades with it are very sharp. The price is good, i believe i got more than what i paid for. I did my studies. To me this razor was a common sense answer, it will function very well for many yrs and save money in the process. I also purchased a 100ct. of derby extra blades which i am satisfied, I enjoy the art of shaving and enjoy this razor very much. I will study other products, but, for the Quality and cost and delivery of this Quality razor, it is highly recommended. Thx.</li>
    <li> this razor is very well constructed, and the material is high quality, but I wish it had at least a 4 &amp;#34; long handle. I have large hands and the edwins 3 1/4 &amp;#34; handle is not properly balanced in my hand. I wish edwin jagger would supply a longer hanldle</li>
    <li> I just started using safety razors, so I bought this one based just on online reviews and name recognition. Could not be happier! Nice heavy handle, good workmanship, solid feel. Great shave as well!</li>
    <li> I rarely write reviews, but I do feel the need to say what a great product this is. It is a joy to use. Each day I actually look forward to shaving. For a number of months, I agonized over spending that much money for a new razor. I had been using a 45 yr old adjustable Gillette (and none of the adjustment positions ever seemed right), so I thought all razors were alike. But, no. This one shaves close without any irritation. It is a solidly quality razor.</li>
    <li> This is my first and probably last safety razor. Mainly because I don&#x27;t consider myself one of those weird shaving enthusiasts who feels the need to own every safety and straight razor out there, also because this razor is made so well, it will probably last a very long time. I have always used Mach 3&#x27;s and the newer Fusion since I&#x27;ve been a young teen. But now in my mid-twenties, I&#x27;ve felt the need start budgeting on certain things. I&#x27;ve known about these for a while, but have always been afraid I&#x27;d cut myself horrendously bad, but the fact that a pack of 100 razors (300 days of shaving if you use a blade 3 times every day, 600 days if you shave every other day) is $10-15 seemed too good to pass up. So I made the decision to switch over. I&#x27;d seen cheaper razors, but knowing myself, I&#x27;d eventually want a better razor, and choosing this one as my first was definitely the right choice. It has a beautiful finish, it looks like it should cost double what it does. There is also very nice weight to it, you don&#x27;t have to pull the thing down like you would with some razors due to lack of weight, it just glides down your face. Lastly, it&#x27;s incredibly smooth. I shaved for the first time today using Astra premium blades and didn&#x27;t have a single cut and absolutely no razor burn or irritation. My only two problems would be the need to do 3 or so passes to get a thorough shave, and the fact that the opening mechanism is at the top, so you have to hold the sides of the razor head (could cut yourself if not careful to grip onto the sides).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this razor to anyone new to safety razors, or even those who use a different blade and want something of higher quality.</li>
    <li> he loved it! shaves every day, (his italian) and he loves it! would recommended to any one. shipped very fast!</li>
    <li> Who ever is not getting an excellent shave from these razors is doing something wrong ! I have been using mine for quite awhile and it is the best quality razor out there ! You just need to find your own routine for shaving and products, it takes awhile, it is an art, something to enjoy everyday, a time to relax , do not rush, and use no pressure,</li>
    <li> Just had the best/closest shave of my life with this old school Safety Razor. This Chrome plated English made beauty is one of the best purchases I have made! (Only 33 bucks!) Those multi blade cartridge razors are garbage compared to old school Double edged razor blades and a TON cheaper. Pure steel blades are 100% recyclable too. Turn shaving from being a chore into an artful enjoyable experience and save some money too! After cleaning the razor for the first time I can see why the multi blade cartridges don&#x27;t last. #theArtOfManliness</li>
    <li> I would give it six stars if I could.  Watch the videos on youtube, it will help you learn how to properly shave with a DE razor.  I also purchased Taylor of Old Bond Street, Almond Shaving Cream Bowl and Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush.  All three are amazing.</li>
    <li> I can not give a 5 star due to this being my first safety razor.  I LIKE IT!  Great shave, razor blades are cheap.  My wife LOVES the close shave.  Who could ask for more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The balance and feel of the De89lbl is great.  No nicks or cuts after a week of shaving!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get one quick!</li>
    <li> The Edwin Jagger DE89 is a prefect razor for all sorts of DE shavers! If you are a beginner or someone who has years of experience it delivers a GREAT shave. The head design isn&#x27;t aggressive like Merkur and it&#x27;s nicely balanced. I worrried about dropping it due to the lack of a cross/cut design on the handle but the chromed lines on it are perfect! I have no concerns now about dropping it! As well this is a piece of beauty! The chrome plating is excellent and flawless!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend as an introduction to safety razors. It&#x27;s lovely! It&#x27;s decently weighty, has a shorter, manageable handle, shaves like a dream, and looks very nice on display. He is getting a nice, close shave without tearing up his sensitive skin, which is great since I don&#x27;t enjoy stubble kisses. :)</li>
    <li> This Edwin Jagger DE89Lbl is great.  I watched a video online before purchasing and its everything that the man on the video suggested, smooth, no cuts, weighted very well, no pressure needed.  smooth clean shave the first time.  Excellent razor!  Will last a lifetime, even hand down for generations...</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t shaved with a double edge razor in over 30 years.  I decided to give it a try, since the price of Mach III Blades are getting totally out of sight.  I did my research, and was torn between Merkur and the Edwin Jagger DE89LBL.  After reading many reviews and watching video&#x27;s on this razor, I decided to go with the Edwin Jagger.  The first two shaves, no nicks, close shave, and moves so smoothly across the face.  If you are looking for a great DE Shaver, look no further!  The DE89LBL Rocks!!!  Very well packaged, and I look forward to shaving each morning.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I now shave every day with this razor. I also bought a package with all different blades. The razor with these blades and shaving cream out of a can (I know that&#x27;s cras) give me a great shave every day.</li>
    <li> I really like this razor. It is heavy enough that I don&#x27;t have to apply much pressure. If you have big hands (mine are large) you may want a slightly longer handle.</li>
    <li> Best shave I&#x27;ve had, cut back on my ingrown hairs by 90% too. When you buy this don&#x27;t just get the razor get a brush and a nice stand, and some classic shave soap as well. The blade comes with a 5 pack of razors too but don&#x27;t forget to get extras.</li>
    <li> This is a very fine razor! Quality is apparent in its appearance and performance. I would not know how anyone could get a better shave, no matter how much more they spend. Rinse and dry it after each use. Don&#x27;t beat it up. Just common sense treatment of this shaving tool, and it should last you and your son for a lifetime.</li>
    <li> This here has received so many reviews and I am just starting out on my journey of single razor wet shaving so I decided to try it. I have only shaved twice with it so far and I can tell I got a better closer shave when comparing the first and second time I used it. I will say that the handle IS SHORT. Other here have said it is a good length, or that it is just right. I came from using a Gillete FUSION PROGLIDE so I was used to a longer handle. Despite the shorter than used to handle it performed very very well and I am extremely happy. The textured handle makes it easier to grip when your hands are wet which is more comforting seeing that using this for the very first time was borderline terrifying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Full metal body has very good build quality&lt;br /&gt;The weight felt just right (I am new to this method of shaving but just letting the weight fall across my cheeks was sufficient)&lt;br /&gt;Very nice vintage look and feel&lt;br /&gt;Can take most if not all standard razors&lt;br /&gt;The blades it comes with are decent blades&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Not enough to deduct a star but I was just not used to the shorter handle and would have loved and extra inch of handle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this for anyone like me who wanted to try this method of shaving, whether for practicality, cost effectiveness, or like me just for the nice vintage meditational feeling it gives you before, during, and after the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In case you were wondering, it comes with a few blades, initially I shaved using a blade that it came with and it was pretty good, I then opted for the famous Japanese feather razor. I was not disappointed</li>
    <li> The best shaving experience!&lt;br /&gt;Very nice looking, amazing built quality. Nice and close shave. Definitely worse the money.&lt;br /&gt;Still testing difference razors on it. Derby razor is good so far after 3 shaves.&lt;br /&gt;Overall: Edwin Jagger is a perfect choice.</li>
    <li> We are pro merkur BUT this DE razor is very nice.  My husband loved it. Long handle very nice crome finish. Remember use GEL shaving soap. It is better than any shaving soap. At least for my husband.</li>
    <li> Gives me a close and comfortable shave every time, I use this whenever I don&#x27;t have time to use my SR.</li>
    <li> The look is way better than the Merkur HD.  However, I don&#x27;t feel like I have a confident grip on it when my hands are wet.  It feel too slippery after using the Merkur HD for a few weeks prior to using this one.  So, I&#x27;m mixed.  This one looks better and is made slightly better (my merkur HD has slightly pointy corner that pokes me at times).  I&#x27;ll give this one a few more tries, but right now, my take away is that the knurling on my Merkur gives me a more confident grip.  Update: I purchased a merkur futur soon after this review.  I need a less aggressive razor than even the merkur hd.  After a few more months I found I was shaving on a level 4 setting with no problem.  So I tried the jagger again.  Wow I fell in love.  The futur is now used for shaving that lazy one week bearer off.  The hd is in my travel bag.  Now I may get another jagger for travel because the hd still has that pointy corner that I don&#x27;t like.   I&#x27; bumping this to 5 stars now that I know what I&#x27;m doing.</li>
    <li> Picked this up back in 2012, its 2014 and I have put countless blades through this razor and it still has that new razor smell.</li>
    <li> Purchased on recommendation from an associate who enjoys his.  Three piece design, full dis-assembly required to change blades/clean.  Used to butterfly-top like my old 60&#x27;s era Gillette, so a bit more tedious to deal with.  Non-adjustable, so you get what Edwin Jagger wants you to have, no way to tune or adjust for your personal shaving style.  Tossed it in a drawer, went back to the 50 year old Gillette until I found a Merkur that was a more modern version of it (which still has its own shortcomings, as well).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m fairly new to DE shaving, so I&#x27;m by no means an expert. But after a few months with a Weishi, which is a very good razor, this Edwin Jagger DE89L feels outstanding. It&#x27;s incredibly beautiful right out of the box, has very good weight to it (and feels perfectly balanced), and delivers a truly comfortable and close shave. Plus, it really seems to find the right angle with incredible ease, something that took a little practice with the Weishi. It isn&#x27;t as forgiving as the Weishi, but that&#x27;s exactly what I wanted--something that would shave more closely on the first pass. By the third pass you really are getting a BBS shave. Maybe there are &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; razors out there that will set you back more money. But I can&#x27;t imagine them really being worth it. This is the real deal.</li>
    <li> I love my new DE Razor what a great feel size and weight. Best of all the enjoyment of a great shave is priceless.</li>
    <li> Few things define a man more directly than a facial hair or a good shave.  Edwin Jagger DE89LBL is the perfectly weighted, sized and handsomely chromed shaver.  It&#x27;s an investment which keeps on giving.  A wet shave helps me slow down and appreciate a tradition rooted in quality.  It&#x27;s charming that my ten year old boy curiously watches me shave with the Jagger; little does he know I will pass it on to him when he turns 20.</li>
    <li> I am not going back to hose crazy expensive Gillette razors!!!!! I have been using this instead and love it!</li>
    <li> This was my first DE razor. I have really enjoyed using it, so much so that I purchased another as a gift for family.</li>
    <li> Just okay. Balance is a bit top heavy</li>
    <li> Sports car of a razor...enough said.</li>
    <li> My husband really loved this razor!!!  He had never shaved with a double edge safety razor.  He couldn&#x27;t believe the close shave this razor provided compared to the disposable razors he had used in the past.  The look of the razor is beautiful and performs as expected.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product for any man interested in using the double edge safety razor.  You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Excellent Razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great shave, less likely to nick you. I use it with feather blades.</li>
    <li> This is my daily driver. The quality of the Jagger razor is very evident. My only wish is that the handle would be better knurled to improve grip and safety, especially when wet. I haven&#x27;t had a real problem with this as I handle it carefully, but I&#x27;d like to see this change made to an otherwise fine shaving implement.</li>
    <li> got to be one of the best on the market. dont think in my life time i will ever need anouther one.its built that good!!!</li>
    <li> Fantastic beginners razor!&lt;br /&gt;I picked up an Ikon bulldog handle because, Even though it has lines, I thought it got slippery at times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The EJ DE89Lbl and Bulldog are a great combo!</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband and he loves it. It&#x27;s heavier then I expected, it&#x27;s very good quality. Easy to use and clean.</li>
    <li> I have become a DE enthusiast! I chose the Jagger because of price,reviews,style and build.&lt;br /&gt; The price allowed me to justify the purchase this razor when I compared it to buying another pack of cartridge blades. I am so glad to get myself away from the bait and switch tactics of so many companies that get consumers to chase the next new razor.&lt;br /&gt; The reviews of this razor really got me interested in trying DE shaving. So many reviewers highlighted the superior shave qualities of DE shaving. They were right! I received an invigorating, clean shave. I now look forward to my next shave (as frivolous as that may sound it is indeed the truth).&lt;br /&gt; There are many excellent starter razors available, yet I chose the lined Jagger for its style and build. The lined handle seems like a vintage design that reflects something iconic about shaving with a DE razor. The chroming and finish is said to be of the highest standard (some Edwin Jagger products use the same chroming that is featured on Rolls Royce motor cars known as Blue Chrome). This razor has an excellent finish and substantial weight. I am very satisfied with the shave quality and finish of this razor, you will be as well.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my son for Christmas. He likes this brand and enjoys the shave and wearability of the blades. Would purchase again!</li>
    <li> Best shave of my life!!</li>
    <li> Thank goodness they still exist.</li>
    <li> Double edge razors are having a revival in the last few years, and it&#x27;s because they&#x27;re simply better and simpler for shaving. I use mine in the shower, no need for shaving foam or any other nonsense. Just wet your face up, make sure you have a relatively new blade, get the proper angle, and slide it down. No need for extreme pressure, just use the weight. No need for shaving foam, but you can if you want. I disassemble it to let it dry, and each blade lasts me at least a week of shaving every day. That&#x27;s 10c/week, compare to disposable razors, or the hilariously unnecessary multi-edge disposables and cartridges, or the unclose shave of an electric. Best option out there.</li>
    <li> This is my first experience with safety razors and wet shaving, but everything I have read about this product has proven to be true.  Comfortable.  Chrome work is excellent.  Feels like a well made quality product.  Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, I HATE the Derby blades.  They cut me all up.  I had much better luck with Astra SP and Feather blades.</li>
    <li> This is a highly-regarded razor - great value and quality for the money. You can pay a lot more but probably not get better shaves. I wouldn&#x27;t go much less, though - at lower price points the razors are lighter in weight and not as smooth and comfortable. I own two of these and use them routinely.</li>
    <li> Fit and finish is excellent.  The angle is just aggressive enough.  I get excellent results from it and a very enjoyable shaving experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You cannot beat this razor.  It is underpriced in my opinion.</li>
    <li> If you are new to wet shaving this is a great starter razor. After reading several reviews,both in Amazon and at wet shaving blogs, i bought this razor as my first razor. It&#x27;s very user friendly and forgiving, build to last ages, it&#x27;s beautiful and easy to maintain. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this razor.</li>
    <li> After reading several reviews, I decided on the quality/workmanship of the Edwin Jagger brand.  After shaving several times, it was some getting used to but the shaves got better with time (less irritation) .  The razor itself is a beauty to look at and the weight it perfect.  I&#x27;m no expert but I feel the razor is &amp;#34;well balanced&amp;#34; and slides across the skin effortlessly.  I just hope EJ comes out with an adjustable razor soon because they really make good razors...</li>
    <li> Beautiful safety razor finish is second to none. My Edwin Jagger De89lbl gives me a very nice close shave and very comfortable. I chose this razor over others after watching videos of its beauty and performance. The Astor razor blades complement this razor for me. I like thisEdwin Jagger De89lbl so much I purchased another like it with a different handle which Amazon doesn&#x27;t carry the Edwin Jagger DE89BA11 Barley Chrome Plated Safety Razor you can&#x27;t go wrong with this Safety razor enjoy it.</li>
    <li> I bought this as my first safety razor to escape the evil, financially draining, poorly shaven clutches of the &#x27;mach style&#x27; razors i&#x27;ve known since puberty and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the initial investment into the razor, and a few peripherals, I&#x27;m amazed at how quickly this clearly superior shaving device becomes cost effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor itself is top notch, with a quality heft, solid construction and beautiful chrome plating.  The shave, after the initial learning curve, is much better than i&#x27;ve ever had and the razors are pennies a piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this razor to anyone looking for a better shave at a better price.</li>
    <li> I ordered both this razor and the silver tone DE razor (that is sold here for maybe $3-$5) at the same time so I could do a side by side comparison.  I hate to admit this but the cheap chinese silver tone razor gives just as good of a shave as this one does.&lt;br /&gt;Granted, this one has better chrome plating and has some more weight, but in the end it just didn&#x27;t feel like it was worth $30 more.</li>
    <li> I heard a lot about this razor and it did not disappoint. Short learning curve with this beauty.  You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for about two months now, it fits nicely in my hand and the way the handle is ridged makes it very easy to shave with and even when wet and soapy it remains easy to grip.  Very happy with this razor.</li>
    <li> Wow! Just used this for the first time! Already I feel like a brand new person! This razor leaves you feeling great with an incredibly smooth shave and will have you ready to seize your day!</li>
    <li> This is the best razor I own.</li>
    <li> Initial quality seems very good. Chrome plating is much better looking than on a Merkur. But it really isn&#x27;t well constructed. It&#x27;s made of pot metal that rots from the inside out and can easily break. Lasts only a few years. Up to 10 if you&#x27;re lucky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the 3 piece design is a bit annoying to load. There are twist to open razors but they have a lot of fragile little mechanical parts that are exposed. In general double edge razors are not well designed. Both because of their loading mechanism, their paper thin blade that flexes/vibrates as it&#x27;s cutting leading to easy weepers, the blade sits at a 45 degree angle at the skin so it scrapes hairs off and not cuts. Because of this they can tug and blade life is much reduced so that even with two edges blade life is less than half of a single edge/injector razor (which only uses one cutting side). Trust me I&#x27;ve used a double edge for years before discovering better options. They are just inferior razors that are wrongly designed. Get a single edge, injector, or a straight razor.</li>
    <li> This is my second DE razor. After my fist cheaper one started rusting I turned to the forums on badgerandblade.com for recommendations on which razor to purchase and this one was the most recommended. I trusted their experience and could not be happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beautifully constructed, perfect weight and balance, a wonderful shave. You truly cannot go wrong with this razor;</li>
    <li> This is my second safety razor. My first was the Mekur long handle . The comparison between the two is like apples and oranges. Some prefer apples, some prefer oranges. My own personal taste is that I prefer this razor when I have more time to shave. Its appearance is absolutely classically gorgeous. The plating and workmanship are outstanding. Its very easy to clean and maintain. I&#x27;ve read reviews that say this three piece razor is more difficult to change razor blades with versus the butterfly style razor. I believe its just a matter of becoming accustomed to doing it. A lot of new DE razor users are coming from a more modern system of shaving (newer doesnt mean better) . I&#x27;ve dropped mine while shaving in the shower and have not had any issues with it breaking or being damaged in any way. Dont read anything into it when I say I&#x27;e dropped it in the shower as it being slippery. It&#x27;s not at slippery when shaving in the shower. It was my fault as I was actually trying to finish a little too fast and lost my grip. Would I recommend or give this razor as a present. I would whole-heartedly. It goes without saying, but try a number of different razor blades to find the right one for you and your face. Also technique is important when it comes to the learning curve of using a DE razor.</li>
    <li> Just a beautiful well made instrument. It works very very well. Great chrome finish with excellent detail. I also purchased Merkur 180 which is also an outstanding razor which shaves very well but I would give the nod to this razor. Its heavier and appears to be a higher quality. Just awesome.</li>
    <li> I bought it for sentimental reasons. I used a similar item when I was a young man.&lt;br /&gt;It was most expensive; I bought it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;I DO NOT USE IT.</li>
    <li> This thing slices facial hair like nothing I&#x27;ve tried before! MUCH better than any 3-4-5-6...n #bladed razors overpriced in department stores. The best part is how effortless the shaving is, just feather-light pressure gives a very close shave. If you have a beard (as I do) it is also much easier to trim wily beard hairs and to even out the edges.</li>
    <li> it looks as if someone bought this and returned it scared with what looks like plier marks---because they did not know how to work the razor---I have had this happen over and over lately and it not only wastes my time but it destroys my confidence in amazon to ship good products----with out a great return program amazon would be in trouble&lt;br /&gt;they have always taken care of problem but this getting broken and defective products had to stop---I wanted to leave a photo but it is not an option here</li>
    <li> this is my 3rd safety razor and it is my favorite one. it is an awesome razor and the shipping was really fast</li>
    <li> I am sort of a double edge collector.  I have several different styles dating back to a 57 Schick, to a beautiful Parker and a fantastic Merker.  My favorite of them all is this Edwin Jagger.  I am both a face and head shaver and this razor make both as smooth and clean as you could possibly get.  I have a pretty thick beard, I was going through your standard Gilette fusion razors like water.  I was paying more for razors then I was for my Harley.  I tried several double edge razors and was happy with most of them.  This razor is superior beyond my explanation.  I use the razor with Shark or Astra blades.  Try it you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> This was my first safety razor and I&#x27;m very happy I decided to try it out. The razor I&#x27;m sure has saved me quite a bit with how cheap replacement razors are. I also love the ability to get so many different shaves from a single razor by using different blades. I found out the hard way how sharp feather blades are... I&#x27;m sure this product will last me forever with the sturdy build quality</li>
    <li> Best switch ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taking the recommendation of about 99% of what you will find online I started with a Merkur Classic. I found a standard acceptable blade (Derby) and got better. I then went to Feathers to see what all the hype was about, those are sharp. After some blade sampling I decided to try a new razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I switched to the DE89 I felt like the quality of my shave doubled in comfort. After more blade sampling I settled on Personna blades. I have thick hair and this combo gives a great smooth and comfortable shave with any good cream.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say anything bad about this razor. The pictures you see and the vids you check out on youtube just don&#x27;t give the chrome on this razor justice. Its simply amazing. The detail of the chrome and how shiny it is! Even the small inside parts of the comb is super shiny! I love it! This is my first razor and can&#x27;t compare the performance to other razors, but with one does a really good job! Must buy!</li>
    <li> This is my first safety razor and I have been using a Schick Hydro 5.  I&#x27;ve used it 3 or 4 times now and every time I have to do multiple passes to get all the hair and it pulls the hair instead of an easy shave.  It is not comfortable at all, it hurts.  This was on a week w/ out shaving and also on 1-2 days w/ out shaving.  Prior to the shave, I took a hot shower and washed my face.  I then soaked the boars brush in hot water for approx. 1 minute then lathered up a good amount of shave soap using the Proraso shaving soap.  I applied it to my damp face and proceeded to shave.  I have not gotten a very good shave from this and like I said previously, it hurts and I&#x27;ve gotten a few knicks.&lt;br /&gt;During one shave, I did half my face w/ this razor and cream and the other half w/ my Schick hydro 5 and canned shaving cream.  It was so much faster, easier, and more smooth w/ the Schick.  I am very disappointed after reading how much better of a shave I would get and how it would just cut through the hair like butter.  Also as I said, this is my first safety razor so I have no others to compare it to and maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong but I&#x27;ve watched lots of videos to look for tips and I&#x27;m still in this same place.  Others obviously have some better luck but some of you should be prepared that it wasn&#x27;t all it&#x27;s cracked up to be in my case.</li>
    <li> Good quality, good looks, close shaves, and most of all great savings, happy to know that are still Companies that make this razors.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t start reading reviews on safety razors until after I had placed my order for this one. I was a little nervous when I saw all of the negative opinions about various razors. This razor was a snap to use from the beginning and I will never go back to the overpriced cartridge style razors again.</li>
    <li> I started shaving with a double edge safety razor but it&#x27;s been a long time since I used one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little hesitant after reading some of the reviews which suggested that my bathroom might look like an emergency ward with blood everywhere when I first tried a double edged safety razor. I took the time to read up on the subject and watched some of the shaving videos on YouTube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This first shave worked out great. I enjoyed the experience and got a really good shave. Also I suffered no nicks or cuts. I took my time and let the weight of the razor do the work.</li>
    <li> This razor works so well. I should have bought one 30 years ago when I first started shaving. I would have saved a ton of money by now.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor because I was sick of using disposable razor. I read lot about safety razor  and thought I would give them a try. After reading lots of positive reviews  on this razor I thought I would give it a try and I would have to say this is the best razor I have ever used. The quality shave that I have got from this razor has put all my others razor i have used in the past to shame. I actually enjoy shaving now. With this razor I do not have any tugging or pulling and the red and razor burn on my neck has gone. I have even tolled my friends and family about this razor because how impressed I was. I even found my wife using it on her legs and loving it so much that I bought her her own. best razor for your money you are going to find. I just wish I would have bought this razor sooner.</li>
    <li> Switched from cartridges after the holidays, bought this after reading favorable reviews here on Amazon and on other sites.  Very glad that I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor is well built, fit and finish are beautiful.  It&#x27;s like a fine tool hanging on a stand on my bathroom sink, waiting to be used every morning.  The chrome is flawless, I look forward to changing the blade every Saturday and cleaning the parts, so I have a gleaming razor every Monday morning.  The lined handle provides some grip, and contrasts well with the smooth chrome on the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving is now actually enjoyable, whereas before I dreaded it.  I shave every day during the week, and my neck would be bleeding by Wednesday with cartridges.  With this razor and a good blade (Astra SP, Feather, Gillette Silver Blue, or Wilkinson Sword) I get a comfortable, close shave all week.  I&#x27;m tempted to shave on the weekends!  Drop the carts and get a quality DE razor like the Edwin Jagger.  It&#x27;s a life changing experience.  And you save enough money in the first year as compared to cartridges that it pays for the razor, and maybe even a good badger bristle brush.</li>
    <li> I shaved with a safety razor about 35 years ago for a short period, and then  followed the trend for expensive multi blade disposables  until recently. I never thought about safety razors until that seen on TV commercial aired, basically a resurrected gillette, so I ordered one for 20 dollars, it worked really well, I had not forgotten how to use it. Well I thought I would step it up a notch and ordered the Jagger. This razor is beautiful, considered medium aggressive. I shaved several times using the blades that come with the razor and a brush on lather, it was smooth and close. I probably have medium tough facial hair, I felt bold and wanted to see how the razor shaved with water only, no lather, it was smooth and close like a straight edge razor with no irritation . I would not make a practice of this, but I think the lather market is somewhat hyped with expensive lathers, snubbing canned lathers and gels</li>
    <li> this razor changed my life. it changed the way i shave! i highly recommend it to anyone who is interested.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for my husband and he loves it. He said it is far superior to cartridge razors and it is easy to change the blade out.</li>
    <li> Probably the best DE razor I have ever used. Teamed with a feather blade, you cannot beat the experience. Just go ahead and get one.</li>
    <li> I decided to make the plunge from Mach 3 to DE Safety Razor.  The EJ razor is very forgiving and provides a much closer shave than Mach 3.  I went all out and got an Edwin Jagger brush and shaving soap.  The process is a little more involved than Mach 3 but it is worth it.  I recommend taking the plunge to any adventurous individual.</li>
    <li> Handle much shorter than I thought it may be - gets the job done regardless.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a wet shaver and I own quite a few razors (8 to be exact) this is my favorite. the chrome is amazing, the all packaging is great and the razor performance is everything that I hope for, I read many reviews here, a dude wet shaving on the shower and drop the razor OMG&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for something good give this a try, you won&#x27;t regret it</li>
    <li> A very nice, non-aggressive shaver (depending on the blade you&#x27;re using and your technique). But under all that shiny chrome plating lies cheap cast metal...some call it pot metal. Drop this razor once, even a short distance, (I dropped mine on the counter... not even a full 1 foot drop) and the screw that holds the whole thing together will break off. I tried to repair it with JB Weld but no joy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll probably get a Parker head for the very nice but useless handle and call it a day.</li>
    <li> I have been wet shaving my head and face with a safety razor for three months now and decided to give the Edwin Jagger DE89 a shot based on feedback and reviews from several sites. Since I shave both my head and face nearly daily, the main reason for trying a safety razor was to reduce the cost of blades.  I must say this razor with Derby blades is an absolute great shaving experience. I have used both shaving soap and recently switched over to Jack Black Beard Lube for both head and face and I get a perfectly smooth, clean shave with &amp;#34;0: nicks or irritation. With the entry razor that I started with, I would use the three pass technique on my head and face and would get a decent amount of irritation on the back of my neck every shave along with a nick or two consistently. Since I started using the Edwin Jagger/Derby blade combo, I am able to get a perfectly smooth shave with no nicks or irritation with one against the grain pass. My other razor had a butterfly top which seemed to loosen every now and then in the middle of the shave which increased the chances of a nick. With the EJ screw head, that problem has been eliminated. Final point is the great weight and balance that I feel during the shave makes it much easier to control. I have nothing negative to report, although a slightly longer handle may help with shaving the lower back of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To summarize: Feels great in terms of weight, perfectly smooth head/face shave with one pass against the grain with no irritation or nicks paired with Derby blades. High quality look and feel. Exceptional value with superb shaving experience.</li>
    <li> Coupled with a premium blade, this thing just glides effortlessly over your face! At first I thought I was doing it wrong, because all I felt were the strokes of the cold steel, but then I saw the smoothest path of beardless face I&#x27;ve had since the onset of puberty! I don&#x27;t know how this razor does it, but it totally eliminates the resistance &amp; scraping effect usually associated with old-school razors! The shaven hair is pretty easy to wash out from the blade, too! This thing has effectively cut my shaving-time in half!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my razor for a month now and I&#x27;ve really enjoyed it. It has a sleek design and is very well made.</li>
    <li> TL;DR:  Nicely balanced, great looking, beginner razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor feels great in my hand - perfectly balanced. It gives a nice shave - not to close. I learned how to shave with a DE with this razor. I bought one for each of the guys in my family, plus a set of Derby blades and they all loved it. My wife gives me compliments on my style and razor; she thinks I look handsome shaving with it. The razor does look great and not a person who&#x27;s seen it hasn&#x27;t asked me questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is NOT adjustable and has only one position - if you have a large hand or a small hand, this model will not suit you. As I mentioned earlier, it does not give a close shave you would receive from disposable razors. This razor has three parts and couldn&#x27;t be simpler to use; just be extra careful when removing the razor as it is easy to drop it.</li>
    <li> Beautiful razor..quality made. Great shave.</li>
    <li> The build quality on this razor is outstanding. I also considered the Merkur and it was probably a toss-up for which one to order. The comments about the quality of the finish was the tipping point for me. I use this mostly on the weekend when I have a little more time to shave. During the week, I&#x27;m in a hurry to get to work and settle for the electric, but it doesn&#x27;t come close to the shave I get with the razor. My Jagger also came with 5 Derby blades which so far I like about as much as the Feathers I ordered at the same time. Time will tell.</li>
    <li> Shaving with the current generation of 5-bladed cartridge shavers (Gillette and Harry&#x27;s) always felt clumsy and detached to me and when the last set of blades for each ran out I went looking at other options. I was at first not wanting to try this DE razor because so many reviews discussed shaving soaps and brushes and lots of extra stuff for DE shaving, and I just wanted to put on some lather-in-a-can and shave (after shower),  but I decided to purchase this anyway and simply use the Aveeno Therapeutic Gel in a can that I always use and keep my shaving protocol the same except for changing razors and blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am delighted. I look forward to shaving with this razor (I&#x27;ve used both Derby blades and Astra blades) and it gives me a great shave.  I can&#x27;t imagine going back to a cartridge system now. Shaving is actually quicker for me then when using a cartridge - I shave more closely and accurately with each single-pass - and less irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recognize that those who have explored shaving more thoroughly and have used brushes, soaps and cups for preparation know what they are talking about and shaving could be even better. But as one who was on the fence because I did not want to commit to a new regimen, I am glad to report that, for me, this razor works great even when using my otherwise standard and quick cartridge-shaving regimen.</li>
    <li> Long story short, safety razors are the way to go with shaving! I used to get ingrown hairs and irritation every time I shaved. Switching to this has helped me avoid that all together. The razor itself is very nice looking. The only downside I have found is its easily clogged by my hair (which may be user error). There&#x27;s definitely a learning curve, but with a little practice you&#x27;ll have the best shave of your life. I&#x27;ve only used the included blades, but hear its even better with astras or feather blades.</li>
    <li> This razor has an excellent finish. I am in the process of perfecting my shave and am currently trying different blades and am improving my technique. Overall, an excellent product. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Nice razor, great weight and shave!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about the finish on this thing. I wish the chrome on my truck was this nice. The only reason that I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was because of the handle length. At 3-5/16&amp;#34; it is a bit short for me but not a deal breaker. For my beard type (Thick, Coarse), this and the Trig Silver Edge Blades are as close to perfect as you can get.</li>
    <li> The craftsmanship of this product is terrific.The finish is flawless&lt;br /&gt;and its a dream to shave with. It holds the blade in place firmly&lt;br /&gt;and is easy to clean after shaving. Aligning the blade when installing&lt;br /&gt;them is quite simple.Just hold the end of the blades and when you start&lt;br /&gt;tightening the handle make sure each side of the cutting part of the&lt;br /&gt;blade looks uniform,then tighten down snug.</li>
    <li> I saw the comercial for the micro touch razor which brought back memories form when I started shaving in my teens and bought one at a local department store and used it a few times, I forgot how close you can shave with a DE razor .&lt;br /&gt;I did a little more research and ended up ordering the EJ 89 lbl for the nicer quality as well as a brush and some Proraso Sandal wood and I tell you this I will never go back to cartridge razors, the old timers had it right in the first place the Edwin Jagger is a very nice shaver it is smooth and beautifull it is better than any thing I&#x27;ve ever had thanks amazon for good fast service and shipping.</li>
    <li> I may never by choice use a different razor ever again! It glides across skin like silk and gives a close shave. Thinking about getting a second for my travel kit. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
    <li> Great razor for the beginner or experienced gent to use for your everyday shave.  The Edwin Jagger De89lbl has one of the nicest finish and craftsmanship around.  There are no flaws or blemishes throughout the entire razor.  It just fits perfect in my hand. The razor is not heavy and is well balanced.  The De89lbl is the middle of the road for aggressiveness .  I find that it does well with any blade i place in it. This is my primary razor i use and i look forward every time i have to shave.  This has brought fun back into shaving.</li>
    <li> This is a great single blade, double sided razor. The thick chrome is has a mirror finish. It holds the blade very well. It likely to be the best razor of this type that you could get. I guess this one has the standard length handle. I know that they make a longer handle model, which I think could make it work a little better. It does a good job at shaving, but of course, not as good as a double or triple edge razor. But, the blades are dirt cheap. So, I am happy with it, but still use a double edge razor when I am in a hurry.</li>
    <li> This razor screams elegance. Weight is great. Good attention to detail. All around classy look, and a good shave day after day. Get one, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> This is the second safety razor I have owned.  The first was Merkur&#x27;s adjustable &amp;#34;Futur&amp;#34; Safety Razor which I used and loved for 10+ years.  I loved the Merkur and being new to safety razors the adjustable feature was a must have.  But, after years of use I became comfortable with setting 3 on the razor which is a non aggressive blade position.  After dropping it to a hard tiled floor the razor could no longer hold the blade as securely and had to be replaced.&lt;br /&gt;Since I was sure that I did not need a very aggressive blade position I decided to eschew the adjustable razor when looking for a replacement.  After reviewing many razors at many price points, I decided on the Edwin Jagger De89.  I am very pleased with the purchase.  The razor is very comfortable and the blade position is not aggressive at all.  I actually think that it is more comfortable than my Merkur and much less expensive.&lt;br /&gt;As long as you are looking for a non adjustable razor that has a non aggressive blade position, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this razor!</li>
    <li> The razor is very well balanced and definitely feels &amp;#34;crafted&amp;#34; as opposed to manufactured. This is by far the best shave I&#x27;ve had with much less irritation than I got form my Gillette Fusioin Pro Glide. It does take a bit longer to shave and you will probably end up shaving more often but the experience is fantastic. I recommend getting a good shaving brush to go with this as well. Oh and did I mention that you will save a ton of money since oyu don&#x27;t have to buy the ridiculously overpriced cartridges?</li>
    <li> Exceeded all my expectations.  Beautiful chrome.  Very solid and heavy.  I&#x27;m buying these for Christmas gifts this year.  Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> This is a great DE razor, I used to get razor burn really easily and this razor has completely ended that problem.  I have also saved a ton of money not having to buy those expensive razor cartridges.</li>
    <li> I purchased the EJ DE89lbl a few weeks ago and decided to write this review. Just remember to take all these reviews, both good and bad, with a grain of salt. I personally love this razor. I admit at first I had some difficulty. I got my fair share of razor burn, nicks,  and skippers. I kept with it and learned how to use it properly. The correct angle, no pressure - just let the weight of the razor do the cutting, and find the right blades. I tried Shark, Gillette 7o, Wilkinson Swords, Derby, before settling with Feather. It is true that the wrong blade will effect your shave, so try them all. I have taught myself to lather up a good shaving cream with a brush and have at it. Shaving used to be a daily chore that I wanted to get over with as quickly as possible, now it&#x27;s an enjoyable recreation. Never be in a hurry, just take your time and enjoy the shave. I have only good things to say about EJ products, but I also switch back and forth with a Merkur 34c, and I love that razor, too. And yes, I get a shave as smooth as a baby&#x27;s behind with these products, my wife is VERY happy.</li>
    <li> I studied the reviews of razors for a couple weeks before I made my choice. I got ripped off on a different razor 2 years ago, and they failed to stand behind their product. No problem at all with the quality of Edwin Jagger De89bl. One very solid and well made razor, and designed very well also. Gives smooth shaves with Merkur or Feather blades and even Wilkinson Sword also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main concern after above things mentioned was a razor I could hold on too. I had worn all the knurling off my old Gillette gold plated razor and couldn&#x27;t hang onto it anymore. My hands are really weak from arthritis, carpul tunnel and neuropathy so I really needed a good easy to hold onto razor. This one fills my need and does a great job. Thanks to the engineers who designed it. Great product.</li>
    <li> With sharp blades (Personnas, Derbys) it produces a smooth shave. Easy to break down for rinsing and cleaning. I like it.</li>
    <li> I first started out with the much advertised multi-blade disposable razors such as the Mach III Turbo and Gillette Fusion during my teen years. I then transitioned to an electric razor for ease of shaving and to save time during my late teen/early 20s. Both cases I&#x27;ve experienced razor burn. After doing some research on the old-fashion ways of shaving, I decided to see what they have to offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After researching the different DE safety razors on Amazon I am pleased with my purchase of my first DE safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed some of the directions from the instruction booklet and from the internet and tried to tailor it to how I would incorporate it into my normal routine. I first started by washing my face with Dr. Bonner&#x27;s castille soap followed by 3 hot towel presses with hot tap water. I then generously applied coconut oil to my face. From what I heard online and now from experience, coconut oil does soak into the skin. So if it takes a while to get to the next shaving area, I noticed for myself that I&#x27;d have to reapply coconut oil to that area. This I can deal with because I&#x27;d rather not add chemicals into my body through my skin. Once finished I rinsed my face with cold water and dried my shaver with a microfiber cloth. So far no razor burn :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to note with coconut oil, there is a slight build-up inside the razor assembly. Aside from the care instructions mentioning to ensure to it out, I recommend wiping/drying with a cloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though this is my first DE safety razor:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Great weight&lt;br /&gt;-Bundled razors worked well for me.&lt;br /&gt;-Nice look and finish&lt;br /&gt;-No razor burn&lt;br /&gt;-Solid construction&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-A little time consuming (practice should help with that)&lt;br /&gt;-Not a butterfly open (for quick easy access...from what I&#x27;ve seen)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review has helped you in your search for a DE safety razor. I&#x27;d like to thank everyone else for writing their review as theyhave helped me!</li>
    <li> Despite the jagged lining of the handle, the razor can be slippery when wet and when it hits a hard surface the top piece can break off the handle. At the break point you&#x27;ll see that the metal is not based on a particularly strong alloy so its fragility is not all that surprising. You&#x27;ll see on the Badger&amp;Blade that this is an unfortunate common occurrence with this razor, so be careful! I instead got the Merkur Long Handle Razor and this has worked much better. I&#x27;ve never dropped this razor and the longer handle could be the key difference. Plus the Merkur seems to be less aggressive than the De89lbl.</li>
    <li> Razor gives a good shave. reminds me of my teenage days when I started shaving. The old Gillette Razor and Blue Blades.&lt;br /&gt;Except Gillette Razor was a butterfly open. This razor reminds me of the one I got when I went into the Army, Three Parts to change&lt;br /&gt;a Blade. Its a good quality razor at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> The razor is heavy, well built and nice fit and finish.</li>
    <li> Although it took a while to learn to shave with a DE razor, this razor with derby extra blades make for a close shave. No longer will I pay the price of cartridges! I will look forward to passing this on to my son one day.</li>
    <li> Beautiful razor, but I prefer the Slanthammer.</li>
    <li> Well made item, and very beautiful razor.The function is very good.But iT&#x27;S handle too short to  shave.Very very well made</li>
    <li> I been searching around for a while for the perfect double-edged razor.  I believe I found it. My new razor arrived yesterday by mail, and it was well worth waiting for. The Edwin Jagger is a gorgeous implement. It is weighty, handsome, and provided me with an amazing shave this morning. This razor is so sleek that it&#x27;s a shame to put it away in the cabinet at the end of my shave!  I am very glad that I didn&#x27;t go with the Merker razor that I was tempted to purchase.  This was less expensive and certainly a nicer looking device.  My only complaint is that it has to be disassembled to change blades; my older razor opens like a fly by turning the handle.  If you are searching for the perfect razor, certainly consider this one.</li>
    <li> I have recently resumed wet shaving again and this razor is fantastic.  Beautiful craftsmanship and a delight to use.  A very smooth shave and as a prime member I received it in only two days.  I&#x27;m very satisfied with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scott L.&lt;br /&gt;South Bend, IN</li>
    <li> I like this product, it seems to be of a decent quality.&lt;br /&gt;has a nice weight to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- The Head requires you to screw it off to change the blade which isn&#x27;t an issue, but you get the sense that you have to be careful as you could easily screw up the threading.</li>
    <li> Never going back to cartridges razors again! I get a better shave than I had with my Gillette Fusion Pro Glide, and for me its quicker to shave this way, since with my Pro Glide ( which will be going in the trash) it gets clogged with one stroke on my cheek, which causes me to stop and clean out the cartridge. Sometimes new designs are not the best and in this case, My Gillette P Glide was out performed by this proven platform. If its not broke don&#x27;t fix it! Going back to the old school DE Razors was one of the best choices I have made, and its saving me money. Get the Edwin Jagger DE89! You wont regret it!</li>
    <li> Very nice razor, very nice indeed!!  Excellent finish, looks slick as can be.Shaves even better than it looks.  If I absolutely must complain about anything, I wish the handle were a half inch or so longer.  By no means does that distract from the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very nice, quickly shipped, well packed - you cannot go wrong.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor. This razor screams quality and is very simple to operate. It&#x27;s a 3-piece design so there is no butterfly mechanism here.&lt;br /&gt;I am currently using Feather blades with this razor and am having some great results. I&#x27;ve been told that some blades work better with some blades over others. I have ordered a sample pack of ten different brands and will update if necessary.&lt;br /&gt;If you are new to wet shaving this a great razor for a great price.</li>
    <li> This is my first safety razor, which I bought as a durable, inexpensive alternative to disposable razors as a backup for my brand new straight razor from Straight Razor Designs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Derby razors that come with it are plenty sharp for my coarse facial hair. The razor itself is attractive, and its design is simple and functional. Just make sure you dismantle completely and dry after each use to avoid razor rust.</li>
    <li> For me anyway....very well balanced and just the right combination of closeness without being too agressive. I prefer this over the Merkur 1906. Teamed with Derby blades, it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve used. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> i dont know why i wasted my time with others, this shaver is the best</li>
    <li> too small, handle needs to be longer.</li>
    <li> Not only is this a classy looking DE shaver, but it will give the closest shave you will ever get.</li>
    <li> very nice razor.  nicely detailed.  beautiful chrome finish.  zinc alloy used in the threading probably means this won&#x27;t be a legacy razor.</li>
    <li> Handles great and easy to clean. Looks classy. Completely changed my shaving routine. I&#x27;m also getting a much better shave.</li>
    <li> Again, KUDOS to the pickers/packers.  Everything arrived as ordered, in super condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just finished my first shave with my EJ DE89Lbl, using included Derby blade.  Superb craftsmanship, excellent shave, no razor burn.  I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll try the feather blades later and review them.</li>
    <li> This worked really well before the threaded stud broke off during a blade replacement.  Lasted for 15 months before failure.</li>
    <li> Love this razor handle! Nice weight and for me the closed comb holds the blade at the perfect spot. I do not like the Derby blades that come with it however. They just don&#x27;t work well on my face. I much prefer the personna blades. I can get a box of 100 here on Amazon for a great price. Best blade for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never dropped any other razor so it was a startled when I dropped this razor the first time I was about to use it. I thought it was just a fluke but I&#x27;ve dropped it about every other time I&#x27;ve picked it up (shaved with it a total of 6 times). I got a nice shave the first few times but now one side of the comb is dented and no longer smooth in multiple places. I guess it&#x27;s just a combination of the shallow grooves and the perfectly smooth chrome that makes this razor impossible to hold on to. Somehow the grooves are more slippery than bare chrome. After the first drop I was extra careful but still dropped it two more times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say I will be switching back to my old razor which isn&#x27;t quite as pretty but gets the job done safely and without damaging my face or the razor itself.</li>
    <li> Maybe I&#x27;m not using it right,.. but I can&#x27;t get this thing to shave hair for the life of me.  Ok, I haven&#x27;t purchased the traditional lather or brush, but come on, I would expect that with some regular shave gel I could at least get a rough shave.  Other reviews warn that you need to be careful as not to cut yourself, but I couldn&#x27;t cut myself with this thing if I tried.  I&#x27;ve tried a couple different brands of blades and it&#x27;s not the blades fault- they&#x27;re sharp!.  I also find the handle to be really short.  Otherwise it&#x27;s a pretty razor with nice shiny chrome.  UPDATE:  I realized that I had assembled the razor incorrectly.  Now that I have corrected this, it works terrific.  It&#x27;s a little hard to get some of the precision shaving in around my goatee, but I&#x27;m still getting used to it.  I still feel the handle is a little short as well- contrary to the guy who tried to diss my review saying that I&#x27;m holding it like a paint scraper- that&#x27;s rubbish!  I hold it just like I hold my Gillette; between my fingers and thumb. If it had a longer handle it would feel more balanced. That said however, I am still adjusting, so if I determine that it&#x27;s a non-issue in the future I&#x27;ll consider bumping this up another star.</li>
    <li> This was my first DE razor and, for the price, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a better intro razor out there. It&#x27;s not an aggressive razor, making it good for the novice wet shaver. Two things to note, though: 1) as your experience and confidence with a safety razor grows, you will likely outgrow this razor and will look for a more aggressive one and 2) because it&#x27;s not aggressive, you&#x27;ll want to use really sharp blades (I found the Feather blades to work best).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it is well constructed, comfortable to hold, and easy to open and replace blades.</li>
    <li> Great weight and doesn&#x27;t spin apart.  Loving this razor</li>
    <li> Beautiful razor but my husband hates the fact that its not convienent to change blades. Have to remove a part on top and make sure its back in just the right position.</li>
    <li> Ok so I&#x27;ve had this for a couple of days now. I&#x27;ve upgraded from my van der hagen safety razor to this and I am thoroughly impressed with it. After much research I was torn between this one and the merker 34c. Both of which from what I could tell are two of the most popular ones out there. The reason I ended up going with this one is because my friend had it so I actually got to physically see it and hold it, and the handle is longer than the van der hagen I have and the merker 34c which for me personally felt very good in my hand and has been very easy to control. I&#x27;ve only done two shaves with it so far but it&#x27;s been night and day difference between the van der hagen and this. Definitely a case of you get what you pay for. Not to knock the van der hagen, I bought it to see if I even liked this whole safety razor thing with out putting a lot of money into it and just from using the van der hagen I was sold. I&#x27;m never going back to cartridge razors and wasting my money on it. I&#x27;m in the military so I have to shave everyday and this is going to save me a lot of money and I get an amazing shave everytime. I&#x27;m still going through a sampler pack of razors to see which one is best for me but even with the blades I don&#x27;t like I get a better shave than I did with my Gillette Mach 5!!! Since I&#x27;ve switched I can now shave before bed and still have a smooth face the next day when I get off of work! With the Mach 5 I had people wondering at 3 in the afternoon if I even shaved that day. This has also made shaving fun again for me, I actually look forward to it now. If you wondering about this razor I&#x27;m telling you you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one, feels very solid and was very easy to get use to. If your on the fence about making the switch to a safety razor this is a great choice. My biggest advice is invest 30 to 40 bucks in the safety razor, buy a sampler pack of razors to see which one works best for you, get a cheap brush to start out with and a decent soap or cream. I&#x27;vebeen using col conk shaving soap and really like it. Big thing is do your research or you&#x27;ll hack yourself up. It is a learning curve using one of these buts it&#x27;s pretty easy. I can now finish my shave in less then ten minutes with this razor. There are plenty of videos on YouTube explaining step by step how to shave with one of these. The two guys to look up that I found to be the best are geofatboy and nick shaves. Both of these guys have plenty of videos that go into great detail on how to use a safety razor, what brush to get and the difference between soaps and creams. Most of the videos say to do three passes but I found it aggravated my face too much so I just go with the grain and against the grain and I have a baby butt smooth face. Dont be discouraged by your first couple of shaves because they probably won&#x27;t be that great. You need to be patient and figure out your technique, what blade works best for you and what soap or cream works best for you. This is a very personalized thing to get into and everyone has different skin and hair growth so be patient and you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> Even though this is my first DE razor, I am like the rest of you:  wet shaving is the only way to go and I&#x27;m now getting the best shaves I deserve.  Don&#x27;t deny yourself the awesome shave wet shaving has to offer.  Stop wasting your money on the expensive refills.  Tried it out immediately - WITH proper prep (hot towel, etc.)  I use Proraso&#x27;s C.O. Bigelow shave cream (Bath and Body Works men&#x27;s section)and the Derby blades.  Patience is the key to safety razor success!  Product arrived in proper amount of time. Looks good, feels great in the hand and has the right weight for me.  Not one negative.  Will be trying a few other blades soon.  I&#x27;ve already tried Wilkinson and I&#x27;ve found them not to be as sharp for my needs, but are good for at least a couple of good shaves and I got them DIRT CHEAP at Wal-Mart (got the last 10-pack on display for like $1.50!).  Disposables?  NEVER AGAIN!!(and only a \\&quot;maybe\\&quot; in a pinch!)  As always, Amazon service and selection was great.</li>
    <li> My go to shaver at first cut myself a bunch but after time got used to it very close shave saves a lot of money in the long run I ise feather blades with it</li>
    <li> No complaints here, it works fantastically. Nice size and weight and it doesn&#x27;t clog up.</li>
    <li> For perspective on this review - Fair complexion, dark hair, average beard and sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My history with DE razors is limited to a Parker (with a 2010 head) and this Jagger razor.  The Jagger seems to be much less aggressive vs the Parker.  The space between the safety bar and the edge of the blade is smaller with this razor.  The three piece design also seems to hold the blade in place more securely vs the butterfly mechanism on the Parker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve sampled several razor blades and pretty much everything but Feathers give me razor burn with the Parker.  However with this Jagger, I can use Derby, Dorco and Feather without any irritation.  Some of this may be poor technique on my part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read several reviews that suggested a longer handle razor.  I personally see no benefit to the longer handles as they seem to engourage you to use more pressure which is a no, no with these razors.  The shorter handle works fine for me.  In my opinion, I have better control with this vs the longer handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a less aggressive razor you may have more &#x27;touch ups&#x27; to make for that perfect shave, but for zero razorburn, I&#x27;m more than willing to live with that.  The only negative (which is a minor one) about this razor is the lack of grip on the handle.  It may be a blessing in disguise as it forces you to focus on holding the razor correctly and using no pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my limited experience, this is so far my favorite razor.  Fit and finish is great with this item.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Takes a little getting used to but WELL worth it!   The chrome finish is just amazing!  Still trying out new blades to see what will work with my skin.  I have large hands and was a little concerned on weather to get a longer handle or not,  well this one is nice and comfortable.    Used to use a Schick and Gillette and this just blows them away.  Not quite as fast of a shave but soo much more worth it.  Who would have thought that at 35 I would be switching to the old school way,  and it will save me a lot of $$$$ too!</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical at the beginning specially because it was my first time using a safety razor and the blades that came with it, were not as sharp as I expected. It works beautifully with feather blades, which I ordered after reading some of the reviews. I spent about $10.00 on a set of 25 blades, but I&#x27;m sure they will last for at least one year. If I do the numbers compared to the five blade-razor that I used to buy before, I&#x27;m gonna save a lot of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are planning to switch to this type of razors, you won&#x27;t be disappointed. They provide a close shave and time after time you will notice that your skin feels really, really smooth. Just make sure to have plenty of time, specially in the first shaves, to enjoy your shaving ritual.</li>
    <li> This is a great safety razor and provides a great shave. Paired with a good shave soap and quality razor it is definitely better than any other shave product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Husband is very happy with this.</li>
    <li> Just got the Edwin Jagger DE89L and it is a very nice safety razor. This is a must have if you are new to wet shaving and want to try something other than straight razor shaving. It has a nice weight to it so no force is necessary when shaving. The chrome finish is beautiful on this baby you can actually use it as a mirror! Fits double edged blades, i prefer getting some [[ASIN:B0032Q41LS 200 Derby Extra Double Edge Razor Blades]] which works well with me but there are different blades out there so try them all out. The EJDE89 is a 3 piece razor meaning the handle unscrews from the head and the head seperates into 2 pieces. So you have the cover of at the top, the middle, and the handle.</li>
    <li> Lots of good things have been said about this razor.    It is a great razor, and very nicely priced.  Remember, that the money you save on blades (DE blades are less than $.40 each) will more than pay for the razor over a short time.    Stop paying $2-$3 for those silly cartridge razors - they do not give a very good shave, they are expensive and they are horrible for the environment.    Happy Shaving!</li>
    <li> This razor makes shaving so easy. I&#x27;ve used a Merkur HD, a couple of vintage Gillettes(SS,adjustables), a Probak, Le Coq, etc. and this razor is one of the smoothest operators out there. Quality of the razor, from every weld and corner, is excellent/superb.     The vendor included 5 Derbys, and for what it&#x27;s worth, they pair up very well. 5/5 stars to Edwin-Jagger and to this vendor!    Ciao.</li>
    <li> This Jagger razor is simply sublime! After using cartridges for most of my adult life, I thought that this system of shaving would perhaps be the more efficient way to get a smooth, closer shave. I was right!  It&#x27;s back to the future where I once observed my father shaving with a Wilkinson Sword razor. I find that the Jagger double-edge and the excellent razors that are complimentary, are above the usual way of giving oneself a really close, smooth shave. There&#x27;s no looking back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should mention, however, that the only caveats that I find with this Jagger are not the weight of this razor but the over all length of the razor&#x27;s handle and the slick surface in your hand, itself. The Jagger&#x27;s handle length is somewhat short for those, like me,  who have large hands. Nonetheless, the Jagger double-edge razor is better, more stream-lined to give you one heck of a close shave that gives me at least 24 hours of a clean-shaven face.</li>
    <li> This razor is extremely well made and highly regarded as a good razor especially for new shavers.</li>
    <li> Well made, sold razor.  This is my second safety razor and is a step up from my previous razor.  I am very pleased with this razor.</li>
    <li> This was my first double edge razor.  I switched from a Fusion and a Quattro.  This is a great razor to start traditional wet shaving with.  I find that it gives me a good shave without any irritation.  It&#x27;s a very mild razor compared to my Merkur Futur.  I would recommend checking out this razor if you are thinking of switching from cartridge style razors to a safety razor.  The only complaint I have is that the handle is a tad slick when your hands are wet.  I wish it would&#x27;ve have a rougher texture but it is not enough to discourage me from recommending this razor.</li>
    <li> I read all the good reviews about this Blade and I went for it. The Blade comes in this Black box, Chromed up with an amazing finishing, and extra blades.&lt;br /&gt;I shave in the shower, and I have to go quick, So if you have plenty of time, and Enjoy taking your time shaving every day, you will like it</li>
    <li> Great purchase! I was a bit hesitant as I thought it would cut my face, but I&#x27;ve had no issues with it so far. Blades are very close, it is somewhat easy to change. Only complaint is that I wish the handle was slightly longer.</li>
    <li> So if you are reading this review, you are asking one or both of the following: 1. Should I start wet shaving with a safety razor. 2. Should I use this particular razor?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The answer to question 1 is an emphatic yes. It will take a chore and turn it into a daily zen ritual. For starters, get a quality, relatively low priced razor like this, get a low-priced ($30) badger brush and a decent tube or tub of cream and have a go. You will not look back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding question 2, I have only been using this for a month, so I cannot speak to durability. In terms of maintenance, ease of use and aggressiveness, it is a great starter razor and it will get you up and running in no time.</li>
    <li> Quality, quality, quality.  It&#x27;s a pleasure to use this razor.  Feels great in the hand, nice weight to it, easy to use.  I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone and if I ever lose mine I&#x27;d order another one immediately.</li>
    <li> I have had this razor for half a year, and I liked it until recently. It gives a good shave. It is well balanced and shaped to give a close shave. I knock off one star because my lost heavy duty Merkur gave a better shave and had a better feel.  I knock another star because it is a bit difficult to change the blade. While unscrewing the head, I have not found a way to not touch the blade, so I use a towel. On my Merkur, there was a knob on the bottom of the handle that you turned to loosen the blade. That was a wonderful idea. It is just too bad that the cheap plating on the Merkur flaked off in less than a year.  Finally, I remove a third star because after half a year, I dropped the razor in the shower, and discovered that it had a plastic post that snapped like a twig from a fall of a few feet.  For $30, I expect a razor to survive a drop in the shower.  I pulled out the Merkur when the Jagger broke, and was reminded how much better it felt to shave with the Merkur.  Since they are only about $10 difference in price, I think I will go get a new Merkur instead of another Jagger.</li>
    <li> Great quality product, provides a close shave</li>
    <li> I like the solid feel of this razor and it does a pretty good job of shaving clean due to its heaviness. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this is the length of the razor. My big hands start to pain a little towards the end of my shave. Its only a month now since I have started using it - so it means either I have to get used to the size or I might have preferred a longer handle in the future!</li>
    <li> Very nice chrome, and sturdy too. All the weight is in the top of it, and the handle is nice. Holds really well when your hands are wet too. I wish it were a little longer though, but fits nicely in my hand and smooth against my skin. I&#x27;m new to DE shaving, and this is a very nice starter. I think the blade was only uneven once, and it was because i held it wrong when i loaded it.  I&#x27;ve used it 3 times so far, and the razor bumps I get  from cheap disposables on my neck are practically gone. It came with 5 Derby blades. I don&#x27;t care for them, one 3 pass shave and they are dull for me. I have some DE blades from the local mega-mart, and they are pretty good till my sampler arrives.</li>
    <li> Great quality and easy to use. I actually enjoy and love shaving now.</li>
    <li> I have to admit I was a little nervous at first, but this razor is awesome! Shaving with this razor is as easy as breathing. Also my face has never felt better after a shave. I will never go back to disposable razors.</li>
    <li> Great well made razor</li>
    <li> Amazing Razor. Stays shiny and polished and looks like I took out of package after months of use.. High Quality! Great Job Edwin Jagger on your DE89Lbl...</li>
    <li> A solidly built and beautifully finished piece. I&#x27;ve used it for a few days but given that it&#x27;s all metal, I can&#x27;t imagine it breaking or wearing down over any number of years.</li>
    <li> This one lacks the gadget factor of an opening top razor, but gives a great shave.  I&#x27;ve been using straight razors for a few years, so holding the angles right was no problem, so far I&#x27;ve tried a few different blades and had excellent results with all, smooth shaves with virtually no nicks and no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;highly recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve said goodbye to expensive disposable razors. Love this thing! Solid razor &amp; excellent shave. Should have made the switch many moons ago.</li>
    <li> the workmanship and quality of this razor is way better then the price indicates. I&#x27;m very good razor for a novice</li>
    <li> A very nice shaving DE Razor that is well designed and a joy to shave with when teamed with the right blade.  Came with 5 Derby DE Blades and tried one and got through about 1/4 of the shave and had to switch to the Personna Stainless Steel Comfort Coated DE Blades I have been using with my other DE Safety Razors.  After that it performed quite well, right up there with my Merkur 030 Bakelite, my Feather 800-1b Long Handle, and my Parker 90R Long Handle.  The Old Saying is &amp;#34;You Get What You Pay For In The Long Run&amp;#34;  which is certainly the case with the Edwin Jagger De89lbl!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Nice safety razor, well built, great chrome finish; great addition to anyones shaving tools. This safety razor give a great shave, little or no drag.</li>
    <li> Very elegant and sturdy construction. DE shaving is not for me though. I&#x27;ll be regifting this to my brother as Amazon does not return items in used condition:(</li>
    <li> I was new to the wet shaving arena when I purchased this with the Edwin Jagger Shaving Bowl and the Edwin Jagger 1ej946sds Traditional English Best Badger Hair Shaving Brush.  All three look sleek sitting on the counter and with proper care I believe will last a long time.  Since I was new to shaving with a safety razor I took my time and started slow.  Within a month I was a lot more adept at shaving and could enjoy the experience more. The razor has a nice weight to it and using just the razor&#x27;s weight you will get a nice shave.  I used Astra razor with this and I received a very nice and close shave.  After each shave, I clean everything properly so they look new like the day I received them.  Even though this is my first safety razor I would definitely recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Excellent weight for shaving. Even novices can use this top of the line design with relative ease. Some other reviews had me worried, but I have no regrets and successful shaves from the beginning.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t a razor, it&#x27;s a piece of artwork. Paired up with Astra blades I get a wonderful shave with the DE89. Chroming is perfect.</li>
    <li> Love this item so far. Never used a safety razor but have had issues with razor burn. Single bad razors are so much better than big brand 3-5 blades. Very well made can tell this will last for a long time.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t grow much facial hard, and not getting a close shave makes me look silly. This is my first safety razor and it&#x27;s awesome. If I could change anything, I&#x27;d make the handle a knurled metal for better grip when wet and soapy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIghly recommended.</li>
    <li> This razor is all it&#x27;s cracked up to be. First it looks amazing. There is a fair amount of weight in the head helping to make your shave nice and smooth without feeling like you need to press the razor down into your skin. The assembly comes apart smoothly for blade changing and cleaning. The handle has deep grooves in it to make gripping the razor even with wet hands super simple. If anyone is looking for a high quality good looking razor to start their adventure into DE safety razor shaving this is the perfect one.</li>
    <li> Longer handle would make it better (easier to control with wet hands while shaving).</li>
    <li> Excellent quality, nicely weighted and very nice looking. I would recommend this razor to anyone looking for a safety razor.</li>
    <li> Did a lot of research and settled on the EJ DE89Lbl razor. Couldn&#x27;t be happier. Great deal on Amazon and received in 2 days using Prime. Very satisfied with purchase and would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Very good razor, makes shaving a pleasure. I use this razor with shaving soap and I have no razor burn or irritation. Well worth every penny and very cost effective in term of blades.</li>
    <li> Very high quality, great shave, looks like it will last a lifetime</li>
    <li> I was initially hesitant to move away from the typical cartridge razors. However, I really wanted to find something that was cheaper but still effective. I went on a couple blogs to figure out how they were used and what type of razor that I should look for. I narrowed my search to this product and the Muhle since it was recommended for beginners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my biggest concerns was cutting myself. A lot of things that I read said not to put any pressure and make sure you use proper shaving cream to mitigate that risk. And so, here&#x27;s what I ordered:&lt;br /&gt;1. Edwin Jagger razor (with Derby blades)&lt;br /&gt;2. Taylor of Old Bond street shaving cream&lt;br /&gt;3. SimplyBeautiful Basic 100% pure badger shaving brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used:&lt;br /&gt;4. GiGi pre-epilation oil, that I had stacked away somewhere in my drawer (I went through a bunch of hair removal phases - wax, epilation etc.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my first try with using the EJ safety razor was on my legs. I applied the pre-epilation oil followed by the shaving cream (which by the way, smells amazing and lathers wonderfully). To my amazement, I didn&#x27;t cut myself at all! I decided to be brave and try it on my armpits. Success! Then, I tried on my bikini line without using the pre-epilation oil. It was still a smooth shave! All in all, I don&#x27;t think I spent more than 10-15 mins on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t really tell the difference from waxing vs. using this shaver. I read in some blogs that people were testing out blades that work for them. The included Derby blades worked wonderfully for me and I would highly recommend this to other ladies who are looking for cheaper hair removal alternatives! That said, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to folks who are in a rush to just get rid of the hair. But I think this would be my go to hair removal tool going forward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still shocked at how smooth my legs feel!</li>
    <li> I felt like this razor was a boring choice to use as my very first DE razor, but after a few shaves I realized that it&#x27;s just the smartest choice to start with. It might be the shiniest, most well-machined thing that I own. Even if I decide to try different razors in the future, my EJ will not get sold or given away. It&#x27;s just that nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave is quite forgiving for the newbies like myself, but quite smooth and more than capable of giving you a perfectly close shave. I haven&#x27;t had much time to experiment with blades too much, but I have used 1 derby and 1 Astra Superior Platinum. The Astra, for my money, felt like it did a better job, as opposed to the Derby which sometimes tugged and pulled when it wasn&#x27;t sharp enough to go through certain spots. This is subjective from person to person, and I&#x27;m also just beginning to hone my technique, so take that part re: blades with a grain of salt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had no issues with the handle being slippery. The lines help, and I just make sure my hand isn&#x27;t covered in soap while going through my shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just a great buy. Even if it somehow isn&#x27;t a great razor for your particular face/beard, you&#x27;ll at least know you spent your money wisely when it arrives in a very nice gift box, and you&#x27;re giving yourself the best chance to find a good starting point. In my mind, the de89 should be known as the quintessential starter razor, and people should only begin to look at Merkur if they determine that they want something more aggressive (or for the sheer curiosity/hobbyist factors).</li>
    <li> This is an excellent manual razor.  Well balanced and substantial, this shaver is an excellent product, especially with the vertical lines to make holding it wet even easier.  Highly recommended - bought many of these as gifts for friends and family</li>
    <li> Very nice razor.  Good shaves.</li>
    <li> Have been wanting to make the switch to a classic DE razor for a long time because I&#x27;ve heard so much about how much of a better shave you get. Thus I&#x27;ve also been researching DE razors for some time and deiced to go with the Edwin Jagger. I found the reviews and forums to be of the most help in my search. Even though there are many other nice razors out there, this one kept coming up in almost every discussion. So, I gave it try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was well impressed by the quality of this razor. The chrome and finish are excellent. The weight is ample and gives you a much better feel as you shave. I ordered the textured handle version as it gives me a little better grip while shaving. My first impressions using this razor was just how easy it is to use. If you seem to be a little scared when it comes to DE shaving, don&#x27;t be. I&#x27;ve been both an electric and cartridge shaver all my life until now. I can honestly tell you that after a little practice your shaving will be closer and more comfortable than anything you&#x27;ve ever used. On top of that, after the initial cost, you only have the shaving cream and blades to buy, which will you find to be much more affordable than an other method of shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I had with this order was with Amazon using FedEx SmartPost to ship my package. It ended up taking twelve days to receive my package.</li>
    <li> very sharp will take practice.</li>
    <li> This is an extremely well made and beautiful piece of male grooming equipment. Solid as a rock, with precision tolerances, and a finish that dazzles. I just used it for the first time, while performing my first shave with a safety razor since the army, back in the 80&#x27;s, and while I will admit that my technique could really use some polish, the razor performed exactly as I would expect any first class item to. And when the job was done, I hung it up in the nice chrome holder, next to an inexpensive but stylish badger brush, and it just sat there looking classy. Could never say that about my Fusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a simple, beautiful, and extremely well made razor, I think it would be hard to top this one, especially at this price point.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t be happier. Great weight, feels solid in your hand, with the right razor it glides across your face.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how a razor could be any nicer. I haven&#x27;t tried any of the similar price point competitors, but I can&#x27;t imagine any of them are any better than the Edwin Jagger DE89. Made in Sheffield, England, the Edwin Jagger carries on centuries of tradition of quality razors from Steel City.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the beginning, the packaging exudes class. When you open the box, the first thing you notice is the elegance of the design of the razor, the quality of the workmanship, and the beauty of the chrome. Aesthetics aside, it is a tool and has a job to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Edwin Jagger DE89 performs its job unbelievably well. The feel and heft of the razor are amazing. I have used other DE razors that do not have the same weight, and there is a difference. Cheaper razors get the job done, but there is a very noticeable advantage to using a quality made razor. Pair this with a good blade, and your shaving experience will be a pleasure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a three-piece razor. If you prefer a two-piece, I&#x27;m sure the Merkur is on par with the EJ. I haven&#x27;t tried the Merkur, but I&#x27;m sure the end result of a great shave is the same with both razors. I suspect the only difference between the two is personal preference in style/design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; If you really want to get into DE shaving, you can&#x27;t go wrong with the Edwin Jagger DE89.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*(and now for the fine print: I have always hated shaving; I considered it a distasteful daily task and a waste of time; the only reason I shave is because the idea of a beard is more distasteful; I used cartridge razors for more than 20 years and got tired of paying the price for the things; I decided to go the DE route a few months ago to save money; and now I actually enjoy shaving every day; breaking out the badger brush and the EJ razor make shaving a pleasure.)</li>
    <li> Nice razor at a good price. Takes some getting use to if going from an electric or fancy new razors. Can&#x27;t beat the price on replacement blades</li>
    <li> Excellent razor!  Very comfortable shave both with and against the grain.  A great way to save money because you won&#x27;t have to spend tons of money buying multicartrige blades for those Mach 3s and other gizmo razors and it&#x27;s a great razor for those who are too scared to use a straight razor.  Edwin Jagger out did themselves with this fine razor.</li>
    <li> Love this razor.  The more you use it the faster you can shave.  I go with the grain first pass, against second pass for a quick baby smooth shave.  If i want to take my time and enjoy i go cross the grain both directions first before going against and use a brush.  Great thing about using a brush is you dont get soap on your hands.  Be sure to wash the soap of your hands and dry them so the razor doesnt slip and fall</li>
    <li> My son was thrilled with this gift.  It&#x27;s like an old-fashioned razor, and the blades cost much less.  He has been using it for a year and still loves it.</li>
    <li> At first blush this appears to be the nicest razor I have ever owned.  If it lives up to it&#x27;s expectations I will be very pleased.  I have not used a safety razor in years and am looking forward to the experience.</li>
    <li> This was my first DE safety razor and man am I glad I picked Edwin Jagger. Good size, good weight, great chrome finish. This 3 piece design just seems more solid than the butterfly ones. It doesn&#x27;t seem too aggressive but provides a close shave and can handle thick multiple day growth.</li>
    <li> i was given a cheaper one as a gift and after 3 uses it refused to screw together. i read reviews and decided to replace it with this one and i couldn&#x27;t be more happy. the razor itself is pretty substantial and feels good in your hand. the real mark is how long it lasts, so if it&#x27;s really short i&#x27;ll update this.</li>
    <li> I have always seen my grandfather using a double edge safety ravor and thought that was a time consuming process.  After doing some research, seems like using one was the only way to go.  Thought I would give it a try, specially since the mach 3 and other multiple bladed razor are freaking expensive.  Watched a few videos on how to use it and felt comfortable by the time I received.  Man, I have been missing out.  This is the closest shave I have ever had.  Now I can go 2 maybe 3 days before shaving again.  The girlfriend loves the closeness also.  So it was a win, win for me.</li>
    <li> I have used a Merkur progress modified to a Mergress for the last couple of years and always thought it was a fine razor.  This Edwon Jagger makes the mergress seem crude and dowdy.  I have never seen such quality plating!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor feels wonderful in the hand, and thrives with any blade I put in it.  I have accumulated some blades of the past couple of years that I never really liked in the Mergress or my 34C but they&#x27;re OK in the EJ.  With a Shark, Feather, or Astra I get the best shaves of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is one of my most prized possessions.</li>
    <li> My husband and son both love this razor. It gives a really close shave so you have to be careful not to cut yourself.</li>
    <li> He likes it but would like one a little lighter that opens from the top without removing the whole top</li>
    <li> Coupled with Feather blades, this is an extraordinary razor. Perfectly weighted, beautiful finish, all-around perfect craftsmanship. Every man should shave like this.</li>
    <li> This is a nice razor, the only problem is with the grooves on the handle. If the handle gets even the slightest bit wet, the razor becoms very dificult to hold on to. The groves are fairly wide apart, go along the handle, and do not provide much grip. The finish makes it even harder to hold on to.</li>
    <li> This is my first DE razor and I love it. I was scared of cutting my face off but I didn&#x27;t nick myself even once.&lt;br /&gt;Three passes and no cuts or razor burn. Just let the razor do the work.</li>
    <li> The blades are the only reason I&#x27;m not giving 5 stars. I needed sharper blades.  The Edwin jagger is perfect</li>
    <li> I love this razor. Great balance and weight.  This is my go to razor when I want to take my time and pamper myself on Saturday with a nice slow shave.  I wish the handle was not as slippery.</li>
    <li> You want a safety razor, I know, but calm down, it&#x27;s bad. I&#x27;ve shaved with cheaper razors and had much better luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get this one. Spring the extra $13 and go for the Merkur Heavy Duty Double Edge Straight Cut Razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a few times so far but it really impresses me each time. It gives a much smoother shave than that refillable blade piece of crap I&#x27;ve used for so many years. Don&#x27;t know why it took me so long to see the light. This razor will pay for itself in no time considering the cost of the blades compared to the cost of cartridges. And it&#x27;s simply a beautiful tool that should last for MANY years to come. The chrome plating on my example is thick, deep and pretty much flawless. This is one of those things that just makes you feel a little more &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; when using it. And there&#x27;s the fact that the shave is noticeably closer than a cartridge right out of the pack. You do have to be careful though, if you try to blaze through a quick shave you&#x27;ll probably wind up bleeding a bit. Overall a classy piece of equipment for male grooming.</li>
    <li> The chrome is beyond superb.  The lines on the handle make for a good grip with wet fingers.  The shave is just a bit above mild almost to moderate.  Slightly more than my GrandFather&#x27;s late1940&#x27;s closed face Gillette but not nearly as aggressive as his 1930&#x27;s open face Gillette.  Just right for a daily razor for me. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The Edwin Jagger De89lbl DE safety razor looks gorgeous and shaves beautifully.  It is also a heavy razor and needs little pressure. I initially used the Derby DE blades that came with it but like the BIC DE and Wilkinson Sword much better (closer shave). No nicks or cuts. Bottom line, outstanding material and workmanship...the most irritation free shaves I&#x27;ve had.</li>
    <li> Good mid priced double edge razor.  I am still trying really hard after a month to get used to double edge safety razors after 20 years of using the multi-blade razors.  Still cutting myself a lot and not getting as close a shave sometimes but I continue to work at it.  I also bought cheaper ($17) Feather Razor first before buying this more expensive one.  Now I use the Feather Razor for travel.</li>
    <li> It took a little getting used to - you&#x27;re afraid you are going to cut yourself because you have a sharp razor for a change, but that is just the thing that makes this razor so great - imagine a brand new blade every time you shave.  Now that&#x27;s a good shave.  I have found out you don&#x27;t need to change them all the time, just take it apart and rinse the blade and, voila! like a new blade.  Can&#x27;t get that in any of the razors you buy.</li>
    <li> I love this razor. I switched from the cartridge razors due to my sensitive skin. This razor is awesome. The derby blades that come with it are great for my skin. Looking forward to having amazing shaves the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> My first Safety razor and I have to say, I&#x27;m very pleased, it shaves as close and as easily as my old gilette mach 3.  I&#x27;m a shower shaver, no mirror, but I watched a few videos on how to shave with a safety razor and got all scared so my first few shaves were in a mirror over the sink...I didn&#x27;t need to worry so much...I haven&#x27;t had so much as a nick with this razor, it shaves like a dream, the blade is well guarded and the weight of the razor makes it almost shave itself.  Just hold the position and let it&#x27;s weight drag it down.  Nice</li>
    <li> I have been soap &amp; brush shaving since l943. I have used a lot of the state of the art razors during that time, including the&lt;br /&gt;Gillettes. This razor equals the performance of most of what I have used in cutting ability and very little irritation.&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to maintain, to clean, and shaves light and easy. The one drawback to this razor is the handle. The handle&lt;br /&gt;of this is so smooth it is very easy to lose control of this razor when having wet and soapy hands.I have severa; razors with knurled handles and have on trouble. The problem is putting a knurled handle on this razor is a knurled&lt;br /&gt;handle costs more than the razor did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion no razor can be a first class razor if it cannot be properly controlled. Thus the Four Stars.</li>
    <li> Truly the best quality shave I have ever gotten from a DE Razor.  Very well made and just the right weight.  Quick shipment and super product.  Will not disappoint as long as you know the principles of this type of shaving technique.</li>
    <li> Way better than 5 blade razor!! Double edge is the way to shave!</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. No different from the old razors fifty years ago.&lt;br /&gt;No negative comments whatsoever. If you wash and dry the razor after shaving, it should last a lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not designed to be dropped on concrete or tile floors. Neither is an electric shaver.</li>
    <li> Nice quality starter piece.</li>
    <li> Gorgeous razor. It is well made and the chrome is flawless. The weight feels great and it is not slippery in my hand. This is my first safety razor and I will try another one. I have large hands, so it does feel a little small in my hand, but so far it has been great to use. I probably will try one with a longer handle.</li>
    <li> Handle too short and blade changing difficult</li>
    <li> So far so good. I&#x27;m in the experimental stage with the razors, which seems like it will take 2 years to get through. In the meantime, the razor works as it should. I&#x27;m loving the experience so far.</li>
    <li> First off, I have been shaving with Gillette Mach 3 and Fusion razors for almost 20 years and I&#x27;ve been pretty impressed.  I especially like the fusion razors for their clean shave.  I have never liked the price, as I&#x27;ve usually paid about $3-4 per razor.  In an effort to get the same quality shave at a reduced price/razor, I researched and purchased the Edwin Jagger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will most likely be returning this razor because it doesn&#x27;t give me as close of a shave as compared to my old fusion blades.  At first, I though it was the complimentary Derby blades that were unsatisfactory so I tried the feather blades.  I had better success with the feather blades but neither blade come as close as the fusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note, I was impressed with the heavy duty construction of this razor and the beautiful chrome finish.  While it looked nice, its function (at least for me) was unmatched to my previous disposable blades.  I was truly hoping to love this razor but I think my expectations were too high. I was also hoping to save money but I am unwilling to sacrifice a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I will be returning this and hopefully getting my money back.</li>
    <li> I love this razor.  Paired with the Derby blade, it provides a very smooth shave, and the lining does help with a better grip over the smooth chrome version.You can use almost any shaving cream, and you&#x27;ll be satisfied.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go back to cartridges after this. Feels great in my hand, doesn&#x27;t slip, easy to clean and maintain. I&#x27;m glad I chose this as my first safety razor and I will continue using this indefinitely!</li>
    <li> Awesome and beautiful</li>
    <li> nice just what I wanted and expected</li>
    <li> Got the razor without the Edwin Jagger branding on it which was shocking to say the least - had to write to the company to get to know the authenticity of the product. They do have unbranded razors which are called trade razors. Amazon should have checked this beforehand and should have informed me of the same.&lt;br /&gt;The razor itself is a dream - it is much milder to shave than my Merkur 34C and a delight to behold - the construction is fantastic and is in no way slippery when wet.&lt;br /&gt;All in all very happy with my purchase bar the branding issue.</li>
    <li> I purchased the DE 89 based on all the reviews that I&#x27;ve read about it.  What I have to say will be pretty much in line with those good reviews.  The construction of this razor is incredible.  It is on par with razors that are considerably more expensive.  Now, I&#x27;ve never used an Above the Tie or Feather All Stainless, but this razor is at least comparable to Muhle razors and the like.  The chrome finish is flawless, and the fit and heft are perfectly ideal for me.  I have a Merkur 37c as well, and I can say that this razor presents itself better than any Merkur I&#x27;ve laid hands on. As for the shave, this has become my go to razor.  I have several DE razors, and this one is the best shaver out of all of them.  I will say that the slant-bar Merkur can provide as good of a shave but it is not as forgiving and I have to be very careful while using it.  I purchased this razor for about $30 - it is money well spent.  As I said before, this razor will perform as well, if not better, than razors twice its price or more.  I would recommend this product to anyone who shaves, period.</li>
    <li> Saves big bucks on blades and is a well balanced razor</li>
    <li> This razor did pretty well until a few days ago when the screw broke on me. I was just going to take the head apart to put in a new razor blade and the screw broke in half leaving part of it in the handle itself.  I&#x27;m not sure if it was just defective or I had not cared for it properly but that is certainly a bit of an annoyance.</li>
    <li> Great little monster. This razor is well built and the quality shows. From finish to the balance - its definitely something you can use for a long time.  The razor is not aggressive, so if you are looking for an aggressive razor then you may have to look elsewhere. I started DE shaving with this razor and got only 1-2 nicks in first 2-3 shaves.  The handle is little too small for me and I am looking to buy something that is little bigger. However, its  a matter of personal preference and I have no problems shaving with it. I just want something that feels little more substantial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Derby blades that come with the razor are on the milder side. They are not as sharp as Feather. That is a good thing and a bad thing for new DE shavers. Its good because its really hard to nick yourself with this razor-blade combination. Its bad because if you are not careful and do not shave with short strokes as the blade gets older, you can get razor burn. I shave once every 3-4 days and the Derby blades last for 3-4 shaves.  I usually throw them out after 3rd shave. But as soon as you feel that you have to go over a spot more than once, its time to replace. Feather on the other hand are extremely sharp. You have to be careful otherwise you may be spraying like those Kill Bill movies (Of course, I kid!). They last longer and with this razor can give you an extremely close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried Merkur but the finish from high resolution pictures didn&#x27;t look as good as Edwin Jagger. Based on some reviews, it seems the quality on Merkur is dropping. I ordered a generic DE razor just for comparison. Will update this review once I receive it. Overall,  I would highly recommend this razor for beginners. Once you get the hang of shaving you may upgrade to more expensive ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I also purchased Utopia razor from Amazon for $10. That razor has the exact same razor head as this one except the handle is longer and with lot more weight. Its much easier toshave with that. Considering the price and the fact that its the exact same razor head (or quite similar) there is no way this razor is worth $30. Reduced the rating from 4 stars to 3 stars.</li>
    <li> My favorite razor I have ever used . It also looks great, and doesn&#x27;t need extra pressure it does the job. If it is your first time with a double edge, it takes just a little while to get used to, but once you do you won&#x27;t go back. 1st pass use down strokes all over, second pass wet face again apply cream, do side strokes from ears to nose and mouth, up strokes for upper lip and chin, on neck up stroke and turn in toward the chin.Works for me, Enjoy</li>
    <li> Just converted to DE shaving, and glad I ditched tho sold cartridge blades.  This EJ razor is so nice.  Smooth.  Works well with my Personna &amp;#34;lab&amp;#34; blue blades.  Very pleased with this razor!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used one of these before. I read reviews on a lot of DE razors and this seemed to be a good one. Didn&#x27;t disappoint. You do have to slow down a bit and use less pressure ( I used a fusion power before). I have very sensitive skin and this works very well! I have a lot fewer razor bumps and no ingrown hairs now! I would give it 5 stars but I don&#x27;t know how it would compare to other brands/  models. I get 4 shaves per razor which is a lot less expensive than the fusion powers I was buying.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor for a few months now.  I started DE shaving a little less than a year ago.  I started with my Dad&#x27;s Gillette Adjustable then I went with a Chinese made, inexpensive ($2.00) razor that I enjoyed using.  From there I spotted this razor, and read some reviews.  After finding a special pricing on this razor I placed my order.  And simply put... this is a great razor.  The chrome on it is spectacular.  It looks like a piece of art!!  The shave I receive from it is awesome.  I get a really close shave and love shaving with it.  I wish I had been shaving with this razor years ago as it is perfect,  To think I had been shaving all these with a disposable just boggles my mind,  I will be shaving with this DE razor the rest of my life.  It&#x27;s so much better and it&#x27;s less expensive.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to get into DE safety razor &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; shaving and started off with a less expensive single piece razor and enjoyed it a lot. However, after a few months of using the cheapy razor it started to close unevenly, so one side would give me a good shave, and the other was really scratchy. I decided to get rid of the single piece system and use a 3 piece one like this Edwich Jagger to prevent that from happening again and I could not be happier. First of all, Its so pretty right out of the box. The chrome is flawless and is made to impress, I want to get a stand for it now. I assumed that since it was all chrome it would be slippery when wet, but the chrome finish is so well done it almost sticks to your fingers (I know it sounds weird but it really does) and the lined handle feels great. The weight is perfect, so well balanced. I&#x27;m using this with my Astra Superior Platinum blades which is a match made to be. Even though this is only the second safety razor I have ever owned I plan on keeping this for as long as I can.</li>
    <li> Updated 10/2/14&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay looks like I spoke a little too soon. I tried I mean really tried to make this shaver work. I love they way it works on my face, but for shaving a head, not so much. You&#x27;ll have to read my original review for this to make sense, but suffice it to say, there is no quick and easy way to shave your heard with a DE razor. You need to take your time and go slow. In addition the feel of the heavy metal blade on your head, especially on areas where there is less skin and more bone, is not pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I have ended up back to using my Mach III Turbo to shave most of my head. I did start buying my blades from a local retailer since the ones you get on line seem to be all knock offs anymore. I was getting a bad shave due to a bad blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still like the feel of the Jagger on my face and use it for that purpose. So for me the perfect shave requires to shavers. Works for me though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Short Story:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right out of the box I was impressed with this razor. Very solid and heavy with a nice chrome finish. Not unlike a real well made tool - which of course it is. It fits in the hand nicely and is easy to maneuver around - nice balance and length for my large hands. My only issue with it, and the reason for four stars, is it can get a bit slippery at times and hard to keep a good grip. If it were knurled I might like it a bit more - although, I might miss the shiny chrome finish. It might be more of a technique thing that I&#x27;ll get used to over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are trying to decide to take the plunge, take my advice and go for it. You&#x27;ll not regret the decision and the Edwin Jagger DE89Lbl razor will serve you well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Long Story:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using cartridge razors for pretty much my entire adult life. For about 20 years now I&#x27;ve been shaving my head, so I know quite a bit about the ins and outs of shaving. I started with disposable and then switched to a premium models like the Mach III Turbo and Gillette Fusion - much better than a disposable for sure, but the costs of the cartridges is ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I ran across some YouTube videos on DE razors. After much deliberation and after reading scores of reviews I decided to give it a go. Well things have certainly changed since I bought this razor. I still need to figure out the best brush and soap combination, but the shaving experience itself is no longer a chore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expected the learning curve to be  a bit steeper and anticipated cutting myself a few times before I got used to it, but that has not been the case.  I&#x27;ve used it to shave my head about 5 times now, my face a little less,  and have not cut myself once. In fact, when I use aftershave to seal the deal, there is little or no sting. I just get a better shave, period. Right now I am still being careful so it takes a bit longer, but over time I think that will change too and I&#x27;ll go back to shaving my head blind in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Derby blades that came with the shaver work fine for me, so I&#x27;ll probably just stay with those. I get about 4-5 shave with a blade so at less than $10 per 100, I am going to save some serious cash not buying cartridges. That puts a smile on my well shaven face.II Turbo and Gillette Fusion - much better than a disposable for sure, but the costs of the cartridges is ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I ran across some YouTube videos on DE razors.

    <li> Purchased for my husband, he has been using a Mach III for years. The cost of blades keep going up, and they seem to go dull quicker. He was apprehensive at first, as the idea of this type of blade without all the modern safety features.  This afternoon he used it for the first time, no gushing blood shed. He said it felt real good in his hand, with good weight to it. Does not feel flimsy like the Mach III. Feels like it should last a long time.  This was not his first choice, he had originally been looking at a different razor. But, after reading online reviews this one keep popping up. He decided to go with this one, figured if he was going to try a safety razor he wanted to get a good one. Figured this was the best way to give a safety razor a fighting chance.  He has stated this one is a keeper.  Update 12/28/16, went from a 5 star rating to a 1 star after 2.5 years of use the razor died. It was used for the most part 6 days a week other than when he broke his arm and it was not used for around 2 months. Tonight after shaving he went to clean it and when he went to put it back together the head would not thread onto the handle as though the threads were striped. He inspected it, threads are still present but they appear that the sharper outer edges are gone. Almost as though either the handles male threads were originally cut under size ot the heads female threads were cut oversize. The handle was never tightened hard just lightly when being reassembled. Looks as though it is a victim of poor quality control. Time to look at other manufactures, with the simplicity of the design this should be a razor that can be passed down to future generations but this one is not.  Update 1/25/17, finally decided on new razor. His new HONE 15 arrived. This one IS solid CNC machined brass. Definitely a lot higher quality. Way different price point than Edwin Jagger. But, is constructed to the point to become an heirloom product.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor about a month ago and I have to say it is one gorgeous razor.&lt;br /&gt;Mine came with a flawed baseplate but the manufacturer was quick in replacing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a mildly aggressive razor and a fantastic razor both for people starting out with DE shaving as well as more seasoned shavers. Do note though that a number of people eventually &#x27;move on&#x27; to a more aggressive razor so take that into consideration as well but don&#x27;t let it stop you from experiencing this fantastic and gorgeous razor.</li>
    <li> Razor is great, just wish the handle was a bit longer.  Quality and feel are terrific.    The Shave:  For anyone suffering from bumps/ingrown hairs, a safety razor is the way to go.  And for those who just want a more pleasant shaving experience, a safety razor is the way to go.  Takes a bit getting used to.  I was used to going at my face with reckless abandon with those twin blade razors (couldn&#x27;t stand those with more blades), so I had to slow down.  In the end my face is now subjected to less scraping (a good thing) than before.  And like other reviewers have said, there is something nice about having that warm steel on your face as you shave.  As far as blades go, the Derbys that came with it are just fine, but I think that the Feathers edge them out.  Happy Safety Razor Shaving.  BTW, stay away from the foams, use at least a shaving CREAM.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that this is my first DE safety razor and I am so glad I switched from my expensive Gillete Fusion 5+1 disposable razors.  Right out of the box this thing is straight up beautiful!  Very good weight and the chrome is straight up bling bling!  I was very leery in switching to a single blade from my 5+1 but after the first shave I was completely amazed of how good a shave I got from a DE- My Edwin Jagger DE89 came with a pack of Derby blades which weren&#x27;t that bad.  I&#x27;m a daily shaver and was curious as to how long these blades would last.  I get at the very best 5 days out of a blade and i&#x27;m not brave enough to go a 6th day- but for the price of a blade in comparison to a 5+1 disposable cartridge, it is definitely way cheaper!     I paired up the Jagger with my Gillete Hydra sensitive gel since I have not purchased a shaving brush/shaving soap (just ordered badger brush and Proraso soap today!) and I don&#x27;t get a smooth glide as I did with the Fusion 5+1- but the end result is about the same, albeit with a few more pases.  I definitely added about an extra minute or so shaving with the Jagger but the savings factor is definitely worth the extra minute or so.  I can&#x27;t wait to get the brush and proraso soap to see if the glide improves!!    - I gave this a four star only because i can&#x27;t seem to get the hairs closest to my nose unless I do it after I&#x27;ve rinsed and dried my face and can stretch the area enough to get the blade in there.  This is something i really liked about the 5+1 is that it allowed me to do this fairly easily.  Not sure if this will change with the Proraso soap.</li>
    <li> I have been using expensive cartridge-type blade razors for over 30 years.  I had tried a really cheap DE (double-edge) razor years ago and cut myself up repeatedly, so I gave it up.  About a month ago, I decided to give a DE razor another try (the cost of those cartridges are really getting ridculous).  I am really glad I chose this razor after reading the reviews. This razor is a dream to shave with. After lathering up with a good brush, I get a clean, close shave every time with little irritation. I have gotten a few nicks, but I had worse nicks with the expensive cartridge razors. For the first time in my life, it is actually a pleasure to shave in the mornings! And,I now have no 5 o&#x27;clock stubble.  As stated in the other reviews, it is heavier than the cartridge razors, so you have to let the weight of the razor do the work. Apply really light to no pressure. This is a great razor.</li>
    <li> This was a wonderful razor that should have rated 5 stars. However, the threaded shaft broke while changing the blade after only 33 months of normal usage. I don&#x27;t know if mine was due defective casting or if this is indicative of a manufacturing process that yields to stress fatigue. Given the simplicity of the design, I thought this razor would outlive me. I was wrong. (Then again, outliving this razor might be considered good news, depending on ones point of view. ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t see a way to request a replacement from Amazon at this point in time. If they will stand by this product and replace it, I will update this review. For now, it is back to disposables while I shop for another brand.</li>
    <li> My Edwin Jagger De89lbl razor has failed after 13 months of use.  The threads on the head of the razor have corroded and disintegrated to a point where the handle will no longer tighten onto the head.  I&#x27;ve never had this happen with any of my other name brand DE razors.  It&#x27;s a shame, because I really enjoyed the look and feel of this razor.  And for the past year I have preferred the Edwin Jagger due to its superb, non-aggressive shave.  I take good care of my razors, clean them regularly, and keep them dry. Maybe I just received a defective unit.    Over the past month, I&#x27;ve tried four times to contact Edwin Jagger via email regarding this issue and I have yet to receive any reply.  For this reason, I would not recommend this razor.    UPDATE:  February 2014    After a few weeks, I was finally contacted via email by the Edwin Jagger repair department.  I was asked to send photos of my razor as well a list of any shaving products I&#x27;ve used with the razor.  I emailed the photos, information requested, and a copy of my receipt.  About a week later I received an email stating they would send a replacement part at no cost to me.  I received the replacement part (a new razor head) from the UK about 10 days later.  So my razor is back in action!    One final note:  I can&#x27;t find any information about a warranty for this razor.  There is nothing listed on the original box or paperwork inside.  Also, I couldn&#x27;t find anything on either of their websites, US or UK.  But the fact that they replaced my razor after 13 months of use is a good sign for the consumer.    UPDATE:  August 2014    I&#x27;ve decided not to change the overall rating of this razor because the replacement part that I received has already started to deteriorate like the original did. It seems the quality of the chrome plating is not up to the standard that other premium brands are using. Hopefully I can get a few more months out of this razor before it becomes a disposable.</li>
    <li> So i was pretty skeptical when looking at razors and i decided on this one. This razor blew my mind! so usually after i shave twice with a fusion 5 blade cartridge razor my face still has some stubble.. This makes my face smoother than a babys bottom. i have semi sensitive skin and all the reviews about the derby blades being harsh on the face and not sharp enough i have to disagree plus after the shave my face was not burning or hurting in any way so this did a great job! Now you will have to relearn some bad habbits but this razor has a nice heft to it in weight and just slides down your face. The handle is not hard to hold at all even when your hands are soaked. hope this helps!</li>
    <li> This is my first &amp;#34;safety razor&amp;#34; (ironic name, that), and I was extremely disappointed in the first four shaves I got with it, using the Derby blades that came with the razor.  I did my research, watched videos about proper technique and face preparation, and all that good stuff, but I still got terrible razor burn, lost about seven pints of blood with each shave, and the results were uneven and rough.  Before returning to cartridge razors, however, I decided to try different blades.  Unable to find any of the recommended brands in my hometown (and unwilling to wait for a shipment from Amazon), I bought a package of generic, Israel-manufactured blades from the local grocery story.  They made a tremendous positive difference!  I&#x27;ve shaved with them only once, but the razor burn is gone, the blood-letting was greatly reduced, and my face is just as smooth as though I&#x27;d used a five-blade cartridge.  So while I don&#x27;t know if this is a great safety razor compared to others, I can tell you that it is very effective--but only if used with good blades!</li>
    <li> Yo-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this razor gives a decent shave using the Gillette Silver Blue blades - the handle is perfectly smooth - making the razor slip around in your wet fingers - contributing to the &#x27;nick&#x27; factor so hated amongst us serious shavers.  Solution - buy a cheap long handled razor with a knurled handle and get the best of both worlds.</li>
    <li> Awesome razor. Worth every penny. I would just prefer the handle be a bit longer is all.</li>
    <li> I cannot find anything wrong or different as was advertised. It&#x27;s a beautiful and functional razor that is simple to operate and comfortable on the hand and face.</li>
    <li> I bought two Razors to test.  This and the Merkur Long Handle 180 razor  This is classic design, well made, and a nice feel. I think it was a bit top heavy.  Compared to the Merkur, I found it a bit too aggressive for my face.  I have just returned to safety razor shaving and I truly believe every person is probably different.  It takes the right combination of razor, blade and shaving cream plus technique to find the right one for you.  I have a tough beard interfused with tough grey hards and cut myself a few times with this one.</li>
    <li> Great weight, easy to figure out the angle when saving my head.&lt;br /&gt;It does take a little bit of time to get used to it if you have never used a safety razor before</li>
    <li> The razor itself is just fantastic. I&#x27;m new to this \\&quot;classic\\&quot; style of shaving and it&#x27;s not as hard as one might think. No ingrown hairs, bumps, etc. The blades seem to be great as well. Not sure what I might be getting next when these run out, perhaps the same!</li>
    <li> Actually, it would probably make a good razor for most. Nice construction, simple design, and quality metal. I did some reading before my purchase and this model was highly favored. The fact that a pack of blades is thrown in makes for an easy entry into wet shaving. My shaving costs have been sliced by 2/3 and it&#x27;s more satisfying. If you are new to this go online and watch a few videos and practice carefully. Your technique will improve after a week or so.  Try different blades to find the ones that suit you best. Enjoy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Edwin Jagger for about 3 months now.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  I would imagine that every Double Edge razor is a little different but this one works well for me.  It has a nice weight and is simple to take apart/reinstall blades on.  I&#x27;ve only cut myself once when I was in a big hurry for work and that was my fault to be honest.  I really enjoy the closeness of the shave.  It&#x27;s also nice being able to toss blades at the first sign of dullness due to how affordable they are.  I would say it will pay for itself in the first month when you consider how expensive \\&quot;Mach whatever\\&quot; type blades cost.  Take your time the first few shaves and maybe even watch a Youtube video if your really nervous, but you&#x27;ll quickly get the hang of it and be shaving just as fast and close as you where before with a better looking razor and blades that you can afford to toss after every shave if you want!</li>
    <li> This is my first DE razor so I have no experience with other DE razors for comparison.  I can say that I truly enjoy shaving now.  I use this razor as well as the Poraso Green tea and Oatmeal shaving soap and the Poraso liquid after shave.  I have sensitive skin and even when I bought the expensive razors my skin would still be irritated after each shave.  With this razor and the poraso products I have had zero irritation after 3 months of use.  I was also worried that I would cut myself with this razor or have a learning curve.  I found that this razor is easier to use than the expensive store razors and does a better job.  I do occasionally knick myself but no more than I did with the other razors.  The razor also feels substantial in your hand which seems to make shaving easier.</li>
    <li> This is my first DE razor. I have nothing to compare it too, but I really like it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my boyfriend as a gift. He is just starting out with the double edge safety razor. I read the reviews and this seemed to be the best for the price. The order arrived on time and the razor is very nice!</li>
    <li> This was my first double edge razor. I was about to purchase a Merkur, but after reading a blog review elsewhere on the DE89L, I decided to give it a shot. I also bought the Derby blades, as most reviews have suggested to be a great match, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the pairing. That&#x27;s a nice looking and good quality razor.</li>
    <li> I do really like the razor. would get 5 stars if you didn&#x27;t have to take it apart to get the razor in. a minor inconvenience though</li>
    <li> Been DE shaving for a few weeks, improving technique with every shave. Every process and component is critical to result in a great shaving experience.  This vendor was fast.  the razor is different than merkur classic hd.  The weight is very similar to the classic.  The balance is excellent.  The orientation is slightly head heavy, only just.  I prefer this balance.  the finish and fit is a bit more refined than the classic hd, and it appears that the  geometry of the head is the same as merkur classic hd.    The handle is slightly longer, and doesn&#x27;t have an aggressive knurled pattern, but is no problem whatsoever.  the head comes off the handle in two pieces, leaving three total pieces.  Changing a blade is simple, although I prefer the merkur two piece construction, but won&#x27;t \\&quot;deduct\\&quot; a star rating.  It&#x27;s just different.  I&#x27;d say, all in all, this razor would be a \\&quot;go to\\&quot; razor for a gift, or anyone that wants to start using DE to shave.    I also upgraded from Gillette platinum to derby extra blades, a noteable upgrade for me.  Going back to a sensor/fusion/hydro 5 is just never going to happen.  For those considering DE shaving, this would be a wonderful choice.  The ability to get a proper lather, and take your time is imperative for a close shave.  \\&quot;Close\\&quot; is a term that anyone that hasn&#x27;t used a DE is surely unaware of.    I&#x27;m enjoying DE shaving very much.</li>
    <li> i like this very much its dos not have any  moving parts that assist with opening or closing the shaver. its three pieces, four with the blade.&lt;br /&gt;the handle the base and the top with the blade fitting very securely in between the base and the top. unscrewing the handle from the top then flip the top over drop in a blade then drop the base on the blade then screw the handle back on to the top which  sandwiched the base and know the blade together. the angle of the top that exposes the blade gives me a very nice shave. for clean up its the same process just unscrew the handle from the top loosening the base the blade and the top, from their just remove the base and blade and wash all of it because i can cleanly wash off the blade and wipe it dry the blade stays very sharp i have used the same blade know for three weeks and its still very sharp. i am happy i moved from the mach 3 to this. the mach 3 was a pain to clean and went dull on me in about 2 weeks not to mention the replacement bladed cartridges were way to expensive. i am getting just as good a shave from the one blade, i really don&#x27;t understand why they keep adding blades its silly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i strongly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I bought this and then realized that this has the same exact head as my Muhle R89 razor, just a different handle. Oh well... another razor to add to my collection.  This is a great razor. The handle has smooth lines and not a knurled/barley type. Some have mentioned having difficulty with slippage with this handle but, so far, I haven&#x27;t had any issues at all; even with my hands wet.  The razor has a little bit more weight than my Muhle and the finish is very good.</li>
    <li> Probably the best I have ever tried. Well balanced the quality is remarkable</li>
    <li> Great razor, chrome is real nice, I just wish the handle was a little longer.  Gives an excellent shave.  Mush better than those disposable razors and doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin like those ones.</li>
    <li> My first DE, pretty happy so far, got some good results. Will see how it holds after some use, hope to last at least a year or two without any damage/corrosion. Just be extra careful when changing blades: if you screw it too tight it will be hard and dangerous to open later and your finger may slip in the blade when trying (own pathetic experience - lesson learned).</li>
    <li> I decided to stop buying multi-blade razors and try out Traditional wet shaving. So as my first DE razor, I have nothing to compare to except the multi-blade razors from Gillette and Schick.  After 7 shaves with this razor, I can honestly say I will not be turning back.  My shave on one DE razor blade is so much closer than anything I have shaved with before and with far less irritation. I would recommend this to anyone tired of the cost and mediocre shave of the multi-blade razors.  This is good gateway razor to the timeless art of wet shaving.</li>
    <li> The only reason I give it a 4 stars is due to I have to completely remove the top to replace the razor.  Other then that, this is good stuff</li>
    <li> Just buy this. It&#x27;s beautiful, heavy, strong and way less expensive to shave with than disposables or even Dollar Shave Club. Plus, you get a close shave that doesn&#x27;t burn at all, and you look classy as... Anyway, I&#x27;m so pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Just beginning with DE wet shaving. Most importantly, the blade squares in perfectly. It&#x27;s a good looking instrument and is not too aggressive, which is important for beginners and for those prone to razor bumps. I am quite happy with this purchase. I have discovered that there is some attractive looking razors out there that do not align the blades squarely, this one does.  Nothing more to be said.</li>
    <li> Meh. Not as good as I hoped it would be. I am used to vintage Gillette Flatheads and compared to those razors this one could use a better grip and a better, more gentle, angle.</li>
    <li> This was my first REAL razor and WOW! This razor, while short, has a very comfortable weight to it and is very easy to clean. I&#x27;m still new to DE shaving, but every time I shave with this I get an excellent and close shave with minimal cuts.</li>
    <li> This is a great beginner razor. It&#x27;s got a good weight and handle that&#x27;s just right in length.    Also the chrome plating is really solid. I like it better than the Merkur.    It&#x27;s currently my razor of choice.    The quality should last a lifetime and then some.    If you only buy one razor, make it this one.    If you are new to wet shaving check this out.    http://livewellspendlesshavefun.blogspot.com/2014/09/my-first-shave-with-double-edge-razor.html</li>
    <li> Good we it and balance. Not fond of the Derby blades, buy a sample pack of blades and experiment.</li>
    <li> Handle is far too small. I have an average hand for a women and this doesn&#x27;t fit comfortably in my own hand, never mind for my husband to use as this was a gift for him. Also the handle would not unscrew to open the top where the blade goes in. I would have liked this very much if the handle was longer for an adult male to hold and it worked.</li>
    <li> Great DE razor. I am very pleased with the purchase.  very nice weight, easy to clean and beautiful.  Very satisfied with my Edwin!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product being new to double edged wet shaving, I wanted a quality razor to learn how to shave. Then I can determine it was my shaving technique and not the razor. Razor came within an acceptable time frame and it is heavier than I thought it would be.  After I bought Gillette razors, derby was really not up to the task, the razor performed nicely. Nice smooth shaves, with a 3 way pass, that competes with a Mach 3. Be careful the shaving style is different than is used with the newer disposal razors.  The finish is nice and the weight helps with the shave of the product. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Good quality.  Good weight.  Don&#x27;t drop it in the shower though.  Mine fell a couple times and the screw end on the handle broke off.  It looked like it&#x27;s cast, so not as strong as it could be.  Amazon replaced it no questions asked and I&#x27;ve just been more careful since getting it back.  Does a great job shaving.  The blades always seat perfectly centered and are held nice and tight.</li>
    <li> This razor is great! I&#x27;ve been using disposable razors and went back to using a double edge and love it. Didn&#x27;t know what I was missing. If your thinking of buying a razor, this is the one to get.</li>
    <li> Its my first DE razor so kinda hard to judge, it looks very nice and I didn&#x27;t cut my face up in the first couple of uses.</li>
    <li> Smooth, lovely razor, it is not as aggressive as i would have liked.  If I use shave oil it is a bit slippery.</li>
    <li> this razor was described by many users as solidly build, top quality chrome finish and hefty feeling when shaving. it suit me fine even though i am Asian with 5&#x27; 6&amp;#34;. love it!</li>
    <li> Had been using an electric shaver for years after making the switch from expensive multi blade cartridges.  Through the years, I can&#x27;t say that I was every truly happy with the closeness or experience of dry shaving.  After thinking about going back to wet shaving, I stumbled into the recent movement of guys going back to DE Safety razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First time user of DE, and I have to say that I really enjoy the craftsmanship that is in this product.  I was a bit intimidated at using this today, when it came in the mail, since I had never used a safety razor before.  I ordered it with the Van Der Hagen Luxury Shave Set and took it for a test drive.  I was surprised at how little effort it took for me to get a good shave.  it did help to get some examples from YouTube on proper lathering and shaving techniques.  But wow, what an experience!  First, this razor doesn&#x27;t take that much effort to use.  You let its weight, angle, and the blade do the work.  I did three passes:  down, ear to nose, and up against the grain.  I didn&#x27;t get one nick on my face!  I&#x27;m a medium thickness beard kind of guy, and the Derby Extra blades that came with this razor did a great job at giving me a smooth finish.  I will be ordering the 100 Personna blades next, as they&#x27;re made in the U.S. and have good reviews, if those don&#x27;t work for me, I will definitely go back to using the Derby&#x27;s.  If you are questioning whether or not to give this razor a try, treat yourself and go for it.  It is utterly a pleasant experience with a margin cost of cartridge blades.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say more about this product, perfectly balanced, easy to clean, looks amazing, love it!  Didn&#x27;t know how I would feel about a three piece razor vs the Merkur 2-piece that I had been using, but I love it!  Way easier to clean!  Wish I would have found the Edwin Jagger first, I would not have bought the Merkur.  Both are great razors, but after using both, I prefer the EJ!  And it is less expensive to boot!  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Great! This was my husbands first &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; safety razor and the weight and balance is perfect. He bought one for his groomsmen, and the general consensus is that this razor has &amp;#34;changed their lives&amp;#34; after using the big name brand disposable four and five blade cartridge systems for years. Takes a little practice to get it right, but closers shaves, less irritation, less waste and fantastic value!</li>
    <li> This razor is bringing class into my morning bathroom routine. I&#x27;m loving the wet shave experience, and this razor has a great heft to it, and looks great. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Very good razor.  just be sure to order the good blades.  The ones that come with it are not even comparable and I found myself cutting myself frequently until I switched.</li>
    <li> Great shave. I have been using a much more aggressive razor for about year now, and I wish I would have started with this one a long time ago. The razor has a mild feel on the face but does a good job of removing stubble with a minimal number of passes. My only complaints are that the razor is very light and the handle is a little slick, so be careful when it is wet. That being said, this is a great beginner razor and I would highly recommend this to anyone who was interested in wet-shaving.</li>
    <li> This DE razor is ok. I mainly write to poke holes in the idea that there is something magical about shaving with a DE razor, shaving cream and shaving brush.  I have been using this old guard system for shaving for about 6 months and can report that it is no better than using Trader Joe&#x27;s Cream Shave and a three-blade Gillette disposable.  In some ways it is worse in the short run because DE shaving takes more time and care to avoid nicks but achieves no better outcome.  In the long run DE shaving may be less expensive, so perhaps it&#x27;s a draw.  My main point is that DE shaving is not somehow transformative. It&#x27;s just another, less convenient, way to shave.</li>
    <li> Great handle.  Heavy and sturdy.  See my other review on the Astra blades.  Trust me, once you go this route, you&#x27;ll never go back.  Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> The Edwin Jagger De89lbl is my first de safety razor, and what a great item to start with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor comes beautifully packaged! And once opened the quality of this razor is immediately apparent. The chrome finish is flawless, and is polished to a brilliant shine. The size and weight does take a moment to get used to, as this razor is shorter than a Gillette fusion and much heavier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you learn to shave with a safety razor, you will never go back to cartridge style razors. Between the outrageous cost of replacement cartridges, and the fact that more blades just means more skin irritation and ingrown hairs. I would buy this razor again in a second, and I do like the included Derby blades.</li>
    <li> I love this razor. Good weight. I doesn&#x27;t slip out of your hands when it&#x27;s wet. I suggest buying a sample pack of blades to go with it as blades make a huge difference. I had read that the good blades are by Astra and Feather. So I did my first shaves with other brands to be sure I developed a good technique so that I could accurately evaluate the &amp;#34;good blades.&amp;#34; The first few shaves were sort of meh. It wasn&#x27;t until I used a surprisingly good blade (the Gillette Silver Blue) that I had my Ah Ha moment. So far, I&#x27;ve used both the Astra and Feather blades and this thing will give you a super-close, comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that this is actually the most comfortable shave I can get. I also have a Braun 8000 series razor. In order to get close to the sort of shave I can get with this, I have to stretch my face all sorts of different directions and make so many passes with the Braun that by the time I&#x27;m done my face is really irritated. And if I use a Gillette Mach 3, my face gets irritated and my chin and neck areas break out after shaving (and washing my face afterward). Not with this razor. It does take some time, but I think it&#x27;s worth it. And it&#x27;s nice to use something that&#x27;s so well made.</li>
    <li> best investment ever don&#x27;t no why i waited so long to get one go&#x27;s threw whiskers like hot knife going through butter</li>
    <li> This razor is awesome!! I got this bad boy this morning and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. Just finished shaving and all I can say about it is WOW.... Im gonna save so much money with this you can&#x27;t beat it it shaves just like the best razors on the market now if not better I cut myself a few times but thats cause this was the first time using it I just gotta get used to it but it really does do what its supost to do I love it and I will always use this as my razor now all I can say to the people reading this is TRY IT!! you won&#x27;t regret it I don&#x27;t Thanks Amazon you guys did it again</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research before finally making up my mind and buying my Edwin Jagger DE Safety Razor. I have to say, I&#x27;m so happy that I did the research and that I bought this razor! I&#x27;m a woman, and I have to say, I&#x27;m in love with this razor! I got really tired of spending the exorbitant amount of money on the replacement blades for a three-blade plastic razor and the disposable razor blades would chew my legs up. I have very sensitive skin, so I started searching and looking. I remembered the razor that my grandpa had on the sink with the brush when I was a kid, so there started my interest. I watched videos of ladies showing how to use a straight razor (I haven&#x27;t gotten that brave, yet) and a DE Safety Razor. Right then, I was determined to have one of these fine razors. I looked and looked, and compared prices, loving Amazon, I decided to come here for my purchase. I&#x27;m glad I did, I was too excited to wait the customary 7-10 business days. I received mine in three days and I immediately went and bought a shaving a mug and soap kit. When I got home, I had my first shave with this BEAUTIFUL razor, and was it heavenly!!!!  I took my time, of course, not ever having had used one and remembering the very wise warning from my Daddy to &amp;#34;TAKE YOUR TIME&amp;#34;. I usually have to shave every one to two days. This razor is so amazing, I can go three to five days, depending on how cold it is....ladies, I know y&#x27;all will understand what I mean, before having to shave again. This razor has a nice heft to it, I even enjoy cleaning it and taking care of it. The maintenance, I guess would be the only drawback, you have to make sure that the blade is dry after each shave or your razor will corrode. However, to me, it is part of the elegance of owning one of these beauties. I enjoy the maintenance, the shaving, the look and the feel of this razor. I would HIGHLY recommend this razor to ANY of my lady friends out there.&lt;br /&gt;So, Ladies, if you enjoy taking your time shaving and enjoy the experience, I suggest you purchase one of these amazing razors. You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> My first DE razer and I&#x27;m glad I did a little research before buying.  This one was a few bucks cheaper than a Murker 38c and its everything I expected.  This should hold me over nicely until I can pick up a vintage DE down the road.</li>
    <li> I am a fist time DE Razor user and I absolutley love this product! I paired with L&#x27;Occitane Shaving Cream and it is phenomal. Not a single cut right out of the box and much closer shave than the disposabal multi-blade I was using. Weight is perfect. You do not need to apply any pressure to get a super close shave. Highly recomended for beginers!</li>
    <li> Performs the function admirably. Easy to reload with new blades. No complaints, I&#x27;m completely satisfied with this quality product. Shaving &#x27;old&#x27;&#x27; style beats the modern, dispensable alternative, completely.  Great, close shave.</li>
    <li> I enjoy using this razor. Good weight to it, looks great, and can give you a pretty smooth shave. However, the Derby blades it comes with were not a good fit for me. I replaced them with Feather blades and the shave is much improved.</li>
    <li> After shaving with an electric shaver for about 10 years I decided to return to wet shaving. This shaver is a beautiful piece of equipment, nice weight in the hand with a wonderful chrome finish. I have used it twice so far and can&#x27;t wait for my next shave.</li>
    <li> Purchased this item for my brother as a gift. This makes an excellent bro gift highly recommend for the occasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I never used the EJ Safety Razor I examined it before sending it to him and it very very high quality on looks and feel. Comes apart and back together very tight and seemlessly. My brother being a first time user of one of these said it gave him a really good shave and he loved the novelty of it.</li>
    <li> Absoulty beautifully chromed razor!! It is a three piece DE razor...every piece is amazingly chromed!great Razor for experience levels in the DE shaving world!! From day 1 I have not went back to a MULTI blade razor!!! It is a great item to enjoy for yourself gentlemen!!!!</li>
    <li> Seems to be very well made. Feels very solid in my hand. Excellent shave. Use a light touch when shaving! Much better that the &amp;#34;triple edge&amp;#34; disposables.</li>
    <li> Because the posts fit the round holes on the blade, the blade is easier to &amp;#34;center&amp;#34;, allowing for a smooth shave with either edge.</li>
    <li> The reasons I bought this are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reason #1. I was tired of blade expenses&lt;br /&gt;Reason #2. I wanted to try out something different&lt;br /&gt;Reason #3. I wanted something sturdy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been tired of buying blades at rip-off prices. I figured, buy a nice double edged razor, since blades are the main expense. I knew it was going to be a different experience, so I looked up guides and tips to learn how to use it despite lacking a brush, since I just use cans of shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you jump in with this razor and expect it to act like the others, you will not enjoy a double edged razor, but if you expect something different, and do your research you may find a double edged safety razor enjoyable- as I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;there are things that you&#x27;ll need to adjust to if you&#x27;ve been using a regular shaving razor though, for one thing, the handle of this razor is short, and that will make it awkward to hold until you get used to it. Many regular razors, particularly the ones that you find as most stores have a head that moves with your face as you shave, this razor is solid, and does not move around your face. I however actually liked that, and found the moving head to be much more awkward for me, so your mileage may vary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also, general maintenance/cleaning should keep a good shelf life, as it does with just about anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;expensive compared to regular shaving razors, but overall worth it as blades are the biggest part of the razor&#x27;s cost (go to any grocery store that sells these, even a $5 pack of 10 razors is still cheaper than the pieces of crap plastic blades), get if you want something different, do you research and enjoy it.</li>
    <li> Awesome. That&#x27;s all I can say.</li>
    <li> I love the shave that multi-blade razors provide, but the blades just got too expensive. So after some research, I bought this little beauty. I was startled on how well this thing is made. Hefty, yet well balanced, it feels great in my hand. The chrome finish is Rolls-Royce quality (they use the same process) and it looks it. For my first shave, I took a shower, put some hot water in the sink and dipped in the razor. Using shave gel, I went to town. The first rule is DON&#x27;T apply lots of pressure. Let the weight of the razor do the work. Next, take your time. Don&#x27;t expect to rush through it and not have a nick (or ten)  on your face. (You may also want to check out a video on YouTube on how to shave with a safety razor.) After a few days, I decided to jump in and buy the stand (Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand), a brush (Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush) and shaving soap (Proraso Shaving Soap, Eucalyptus &amp; Menthol). And some blades, (100 Personna Double Edge Razor Blades). Note: The soap and brush make all the difference; together they make shaving with a safety razor something you&#x27;ll actually look forward to. I kid you not. So to wrap up: for about $100 you get everything you need to shave for the next two years or so. Once you get the technique down, the shaves are really great. All for about 1/2 of what I was paying previously. I&#x27;m sold.</li>
    <li> Update - After a year the razor is still good as new. I disassemble, clean and dry my razor after I shave - maybe that helps. Update 2 - Almost 2 years and still like new. I only disassemble and clean it about once a month now.  The razor is working great. The fit and finish are also great. The price was also great (seems it&#x27;s gone up recently). This is my first real razor so I can&#x27;t make any comparisons, but I can&#x27;t imagine anything being significantly better.  Initially I was hesitant to switch to a safety razor. I was concerned that I&#x27;d look like Rocky after the big fight. Much to my surprise, I&#x27;ve found safety razor shaving almost as easy as cartridge shaving. There&#x27;s no black magic or secret techniques. Find the right angle, pressure and direction. Make a couple passes and that&#x27;s it. Making good lather with a brush is far more difficult.  I&#x27;d recommend this razor to anyone - first timers and experienced safety razor users.</li>
    <li> I love this razor.  I&#x27;m new to wet saving with DE razor.  Seen other reviews of this razor and decided to give it a try.  Shaved three times with it so far and a close shave each time.  Impressed with the quality of the razor, especially the chrome plating.  Looking forward  to many more great shaves.</li>
    <li> This razor constitutes my first foray into the world of DE shaving, and it hasn&#x27;t disappointed. Wonderful chroming, nice weight and an easy mechanism to switch out blades. I suspect I could do with a smaller guard and a touch more weight would help a beginner like me, but apart from that it&#x27;s a winner.</li>
    <li> This is my first &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; double-edged razor (I used a cheaper Shaving Factory razor for about four shaves--not bad, but not great). This razor is simply beautiful! it has a wonderful feel in the hand, and just seems like a tool that will outlive me. I&#x27;ve only had one shave with it, having received it this morning.  It was very nice. Now just to perfect my technique and find my perfect blade!</li>
    <li> Fantastic razor. Looks better in person. Beautiful chrome plating. Shaves extremely clean. The only thing I did not like was the Derby blades that came with it. I purchased the Gillette Silver Blue blades from all the positive reviews and they are correct, they are sharp, but not so sharp that they slice your face up. Extremely close shave.  AAA+++</li>
    <li> A million times better than any modern razor I have used. I can easily shave a half week off at a time in a 1/4 the time.</li>
    <li> Beautiful razor!! Stunning plating. Great mild shave!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a while and I love DE shaving. I didn&#x27;t realize what a difference it makes for your skin once I switched to these. If you have a problem with sensitive skin, these are the razor types for you. I only gave it a 4 out of 5 because I&#x27;m ready to move on to a heavier razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I&#x27;ve learned DE shaving with this razor:&lt;br /&gt;-Derby blades suck. They are good for beginners because you have no idea what you are doing, so you wont nick yourself, but after 4 or 5 times you realize how crappy these really are. I like Israeli red&#x27;s. Those are nice.&lt;br /&gt;- This is a beginners razor. I&#x27;ve been using DE razors for about 7 months now and once you get into the feel of how these work, you realize how &amp;#34;non-aggressive&amp;#34; this razor is. I&#x27;d suggest something heavier for someone with some level of skill, or someone who has a thick beard. Either that or this razor with a feather blade.&lt;br /&gt;- You should always go all the way and use actual shaving cream and brush. Soo much better for your skin than the other crap.&lt;br /&gt;- Watch YouTube videos if you have no idea what to do!</li>
    <li> After 40 years I recently decided to return to the shaving instrument of my youth - a double-edged safety razor.  Like many who&#x27;ve switched back or switch over to a DE, I was tired of the high cost of name brand disposables, and sick of the shave quality of the cheap off brands.  I did quite a bit of research about which razors work best with which beard types, and the Edwin Jagger De89lbl, along with the Merkur 4C kept coming up as a good option for me.  I leaned towards the EJ based on user reviews and comments, and the fact that the handle was a little longer than the Merkur.  But what closed it for me was the aesthetics.  The chrome is incredible and obviously of good quality, and the lined handle, while maybe only improving grip over the unlined handle model marginally, gives off a beautiful faceted shine that you have to see to believe.  It&#x27;s really an heirloom quality razor at a great price.  You&#x27;ll want to take care of it to ensure it&#x27;s beauty and quality last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and it shaves beautifully too - just like so many have said.  Even a lot of DE pros with multiple razors, some of which cost several times what the De89lbl costs, consider it the best or one of the best razors they own.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from my first shave with it, given the need to re-learn DE technique.  And my old cheap brush and soap don&#x27;t provide the rich lather you see in some instructional vids.  Nonetheless, it shaved closer and more comfortably than my Bic 3-blade disposable right off the bat.  The weight and balance do the work, so no need to put pressure and dig in to get a good shave.  Can&#x27;t wait to get my good Semogue brush and Proraso soap so I can really bring out it&#x27;s potential!  I also ordered some sharper blades than the Derby&#x27;s that are supplied, so will be anxious to see what they can do</li>
    <li> Percision built nice and heavy great quality product very well made and I would recommend it to anyone I would give it as a gift to any one my husband loves it and he uses it every day switched to it from a mach3 and is very pleased with the switch</li>
    <li> If you are new to safety razor shaving as I was, then my advice is to buy this razor with confidence.  Its made with a level of care that is so very rare these days that you will be astonished you were able to score such a fine product for so little cash.  Its made in England instead of some ever-cost-cutting slave labor sweatshop.  Those good folks in England obviously take pride in what they do as is evident as soon as you open the box.  Its a beauty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Next, it works SO well that you will wonder why you wasted any amount of your lifetime using cartridge razors, or even worse, disposables (shudder).  Those are the hygienic implements of barbarian clown people!  One pass with the EJ DE89 will make understand this.  The weight of this razor is terrific (not too heavy, nor too light) and the lines on the handle give excellent grip despite a highly polished chrome finish (yes, even when wet the grip is solid).  Even the Included Derby blades (five are included in this package) work pretty well and did absolutely no harm to my face while giving me a number of very smooth shaves.  Soon I will be trying personna blue next as I&#x27;m simply curious and they appear to be US made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Its been said that &amp;#34;simplicity is the keynote of all true elegance.&amp;#34;  The Edwin Jagger DE89 is a FUNCTIONAL example of this...and I can think of no purchase in recent memory that delivers better value for money.  I&#x27;m suspect there are other fine razors on the market, but I am 100% satisfied with this one and glad I chose it.  Thank you Edwin Jagger and Amazon.</li>
    <li> Real nice razor, it has been nearly 20 yrs since I used a double edge. I forgot what a nice shave, for only pennies instead of dollars.</li>
    <li> I had been looking at getting into the DE wet-shaving crowd for awhile, but was hesitant due to the people saying it was so slow, you will cut yourself, expensive, etc etc. This was up for sale for $23 and decided it was the time to bite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of the Box&lt;br /&gt;--------------&lt;br /&gt;The razor is a lot heaver than you would expect. I thought it would be light and about the size of a standard \\&quot;Fuzion\\&quot; razor I have been using. However, this thing is dense (you can tell it&#x27;s solid metal), and short. More on these later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Razor Install&lt;br /&gt;-------------&lt;br /&gt;Razor install could not be easier. Lay the razor head flat on the edge of the table and spin the handle counter clock wise. Stand the razor head on it&#x27;s top and lay the razor in. Place the bottom of the head on the top, and place the handle back on spinning clockwise. After it&#x27;s somewhat tightened, lay it flat on the edge again to turn clockwise until tightened. This was you are never really touching the head and will avoid being cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shave&lt;br /&gt;-----&lt;br /&gt;Take your time especially your first time. I only had three nicks. One was when I wasn&#x27;t paying attention and poked myself with the corner of the razor. The other two were small bumps that I got on my third pass against the grain. Either of those could have happened with a standard cartridge, so I&#x27;m not really counting them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really didn&#x27;t take me as long as I thought it would. I went in being paranoid thinking I would slice my face up the first time after all the horror stories. If you have half a brain then you shouldn&#x27;t have any problems with this. I had been letting my hair grown out for about two weeks and this cut right through it like butter. The cartridge razor couldn&#x27;t get more than a couple CM without being clogged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Method&lt;br /&gt;------&lt;br /&gt;Hold the razor at an angle. Just start with it barely angled and increase the angle till you find that sweet spot. It only takes a few seconds to find this. I chose towork in areas since I had a good two weeks of growth. After that I could lather up my whole face and do it without worrying about it drying out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all the shave took barely any longer than the standard cartridge. The extra time it took to build lather was the main cause of this. The razor cut with one pass as good as the cartridge does after a couple so that equals out the extra time it took by me going slowly (to prevent cuts).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion&lt;br /&gt;----------&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be afraid of the blade. Go into it with respect knowing you have a sharp blade to your face, but that it&#x27;s up to you to control it. I had no problems right out of the gate. I didn&#x27;t have any cuts and the shave went well.</li>
    <li> good razor. takes a little practice to use it wisely. still learning how.</li>
    <li> If your only experience with safety razors (like me) is your dad&#x27;s/grandfather&#x27;s Gillette dial a number - you have no idea how good it can be.  Seriously.  The Gillette was so freaking painful, I put that idea to bed for a decade.  After a little research, I found this and thought, sure, let&#x27;s try it. A world of difference.  It is actually BETTER than the three blade razors they make today - which blew my mind.  How do I define better?  Closer shave, less irritation, less painful, less expensive.  Yes, better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word of advice - they make alot of different blades (Astra, Derby, Blue Bird, etc.)  Try a multi pack (available on Amazon).  The blades do make a difference.  For me, the Derby Ultras are the best. That said, the &amp;#34;worst&amp;#34; blade was still better than the current stuff.  And the best part?  If I change my blades once a week, it will cost me $9 for a year of shaving.  And that&#x27;s not a typo.</li>
    <li> I bought this after read the positive reviews and figured it would be a good backup to my Merkur.  It&#x27;s a nice razor to use.  Well balanced, handle is textured to give a good grip with wet hands.  Not to aggressive but it gets the job done nicely.  For the price I was surprised how well constructed it was and how nice the chroming was.</li>
    <li> Started out wet shaving with a Gillette Tech (GT) which is very light. Sort of the Ferrari of razors - fast and nimble.  With the GT it was lather up and zip, zip, zip and I was done.  Switching to the EJ slooowed me way down.  It is solid, HEAVY, well made, good balance, and visually beautiful.  It is sort of the H3 of razors.  Not as fast and nimble as a GT but it gets the job done.  My hand muscles needed a week or so to adjust to the new weight and balance, but once they did, it has worked great.  Like all razors and faces, try various blades until you find the best match for your situation and facial conditions.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a recent convert to old-fashioned wet shaving, and this is the first safety razor I purchased. It&#x27;s great. Feels sturdy, good weight and balance, excellent price.</li>
    <li> Very nice razor. Much lighter than anticipated, which is great! Nice, close shave.</li>
    <li> I just got finished shaving for the first time with this Edwin Jagger Double Edged Safety Razor. I a little nervious because this was my first time shaving with a safety razor, I&#x27;ve been using the Gillette Fusion for the last 2 years and before that a Mach3. Happy to report that I didn&#x27;t cut myself once and only missed one spot! I took my time and went over everything twice. Using no pressure on the blade really seems to be the key. I spent plenty of time lathering up with a badger brush and kept the blade warm by washing it off in warm water after each pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people have complained about the short handle on this razor; I actually like it. I think it makes it easier to handle around curves on the face. It has a good weight in the hand but you&#x27;ll want to make sure you keep it clean because the chrome feels like it could get slippery with shaving soap on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really happy with the purchase so far and looking forward to getting more comfortable with it!</li>
    <li> The old school looks of the single blade safety razors have always appealed to me, but I’ve never bothered with purchasing one until now. I have always hated disposable razors, and about a year ago I switched to a beard trimmer to save money. My boss convinced me that safety razors are much more affordable and give a far superior shave than any department store razor. I spent some time researching all the “beginner” safety razors and decided to go with the Edwin Jagger DE89LBI after all the positive reviews. Before this I had the chance to use the “As Seen on TV” Microtouch-One, but never enjoyed that razor. As soon as I told my boss that I made this purchase he gave me a Feather blade to try out. The combination of this razor and a Feather blade made for a great close shave. This razor has one of the best chrome jobs I have ever seen, and looks absolutely beautiful. This razor fells like it has some weight to it, and the added weight made shaving much easier. I’m extremely satisfied with this razor and would recommend it to anyone interested in getting into wet shaving with a safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE*** After 2 years I finally got around to giving a complete and honest update to my review. In 2 years this has been the only razor I&#x27;ve used other than a Schick Hydro 5 that I use when I&#x27;m in a hurry. My only complaint, and I mean ONLY complaint is the handle. The head shaves great, the handles absolutely suckered! If you get shaving soap on your hands, well good luck gripping this razor. It&#x27;s ridiculous how slippery this handle gets when it gets wet. My next razor will be a Phoenix DOC or Merkur 34c, both of which have knurled handles so losing grip would never be an issue. I&#x27;m not sure if EJ offers razors with knurled handles, but if they do then I highly suggest getting one of those instead.</li>
    <li> After reading reviews of many of the razors available, I chose this one for my husband.  He&#x27;s still getting used to it, but I noticed a closer shave the first time he tried it.  The razor is simple, elegant, classic.  We were getting tired of the outrageous prices for even disposable razors, so I think we&#x27;ll both be happy with this one.</li>
    <li> After using cartridge razors for all my adult life, I finally switched to a safety razor, and ill not ever use a cartridge razor again.  I did extensive reviews and so happy that I decided on this razor.  It works wonderfully and is comfortable to hold and use!</li>
    <li> Everything it said it was. Very nice shave.</li>
    <li> Wow. Nice razor. Finish is well above standard. Quality craftsmanship. Like a little silver gem.</li>
    <li> I have switched from the cartridge razors to the double edge razors and this is a very well made one. It is not too heavy but still has enough weight to shave very close. I have been using it for weeks and I will never go back to a cartridge.</li>
    <li> Nice. Old School is best.  I get a great shave with a quality instrument.  Very happy with this purchase. Never going back to multi blades.</li>
    <li> Great razor,  very comfortable in your hand.  well balanced very close shave</li>
    <li> great razor, gives a better shave then the multi blade razors</li>
    <li> What is it:&lt;br /&gt;Chrome safety razor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I liked:&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful construction, fantastic product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brand new to wet shaving, found this was highly recommended as a good razor all around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first time using it, getting used to the size was a bit of an experience (the handle is quite short compared to say, a Gillette cartridge) but overall I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;lined&amp;#34; chrome helps you grasp the handle even when it&#x27;s wet / gets soap on it which is very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It disassembles into 3 pieces for easy cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weight and balance seems to be very good on this razor - no pressure needed, just let the weight of the razor do the work for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t like:&lt;br /&gt;Disassembly into 3 pieces is good for cleaning but once taken apart, I find myself wanting to leave it apart overnight so it dries out well. Not a big deal - but for some folks, may prefer the ones that the handle doesn&#x27;t remove from the razor area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy it again/recommend it?&lt;br /&gt;Yes, good product would recommend</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving for 4 years with gilette razors and i was getting terrible irritation. Then i was shaving for 4 years with electric rotary and foil shavers philips and braun 5 series and the irritation fell by half or better, but it was existent every time i&#x27;d shave anyway.  Recently I was looking for a top philips or braun electric shaver and in the comments area i found a good review recommending this safe razor. Decided to give it a try to a safe razor for the first time and all i can say is wow! My skin is very sensitive and i didn&#x27;t shave too often. With gilette razor i had to go 3-4 times on most areas and about 6-7 in the neck area. With electric razors to shave the cheeks didn&#x27;t take long but on the neck area i would sometimes spend 5-7 minutes, stretching the skin in all directions, accompanied with lots of cursing when i couldn&#x27;t get that \\&quot;one\\&quot; hair. With this safe razor no matter if hair is long or short, i go 1-2 times at most to get every hair off the face no matter the face area of shaving. The irritation is almost non-existent. Highly recommend this product. If you are a first time user of a safe razor here is the list you will need: feather blades , escali badger brush , taylor of old bond street shaving cream , burt&#x27;s bees aftershave and a brush / razor / cup holder (16$ on ebay) . This razor has 5 blades included which are pretty good. Also never forget to warm up the skin with a hot wet towel before shaving.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to use this razor for the rest of my life and hopefully pass it on to my kids.</li>
    <li> This safety razor provides me with a great shave. It has good balance and weight.  It also looks amazing. This is a great razor for someone looking to get into wet shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I have not found the handle to be slippery like some reviewers have mentioned.</li>
    <li> Very well made, gives a nice shave.</li>
    <li> Better than I thought it would be. Nice weight. Beautiful finish. Works wonderfully. Very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> My Gillette Fatboy is in a different league.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to purchase after reading some mixed reviews.  This is an excellent, very well crafted instrument.  Excellent shave, never a nick; the design angle and opening of the blade is right on spot, absolutely no need for any adjustment such as with the old Gillette safety razors, which used to leave my face and neck pretty badly nicked when using a new blade.  The finish on this razor is first rate.</li>
    <li> Very nice quality and shaves great</li>
    <li> I love shaving with this razor! After 18 months I&#x27;ve only had two small cuts. Love the safety razor feel!</li>
    <li> Well balanced easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Best razor I&#x27;ve ever used and a great product for the money.  Here&#x27;s the break down: $30 (razor) + $25 (50 pack of blades) &#x3D; shaving costs (minus shaving cream) for a YEAR.  If you think about the economics, effectiveness and the straight-up manliness of this product - you should arrive at the conclusion of purchasing one</li>
    <li> This was my entry into the safety razor world and I can&#x27;t see why I would ever need to try something else.  The chrome on the razor looks great and it has a very hefty feel to it.  When I finally understood the expression \\&quot;let the razor do the work\\&quot; I appreciated the heft even more.  I was also a little surprised by the short handle but I think if the handle was any longer I&#x27;d probably be gripping it too hard and slicing up my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hardest part about writing a review for this product is that I literally have nothing else to compare it to.  Since I have been getting smooth shaves and just bought a sampler pack of razors now that I&#x27;m running low on the included Derby blades, I don&#x27;t see any reason why I would want a different razor.  In just a couple of weeks I went from cutting my nose and still being stubbly to having no nicks or burns and getting a close shave, so I&#x27;m pretty happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> As many have already stated this is a very nicely built razor. The chrome is very nice (see the rest of my review for my only exception), the weight is great in your hands and the length of the handle is perfect for me, not very long and not very short.  I have had a nice experience shaving with it.  With all that said I must state that the chrome finish underneath the shaving head (under the rounded smooth area you glide across your face) was not as well finished as the rest of the razor. Now I realize that this area is not going to be finished as well as the rest of the razor, nor does it need to be, however the area had a \\&quot;rust-like\\&quot; discoloration from the moment I pulled the razor out of the box.  Concerned about this discoloration leading to a finish breakdown over time, I contacted Edwin Jagger customer service. I am happy to report that after sending them a picture of the discoloration they offered to send me a new razor head, which I received via airmail and is perfectly finished.  Overall great customer service from Edwin Jagger, although the variability between the replacement they sent and the one that came with the razor originally does mean that there could be some variability in the finishing Quality control from razor to razor. I am not knocking EJ for this, and admittedly there was nothing functionally wrong with the original razor head, just saying you should check your razor carefully for any imperfections and contact EJ if you have a problem or see something that you feel is not correct with the product. I would buy another EJ razor and would recommend them for their products and their customer service.</li>
    <li> Great razor. Good weight and comfortable to use. Chrome finish is excellent.</li>
    <li> Life changing is the only way to describe this razor for me, i have really thick facial hair that grows extremely fast. I have tried every disposable razor under the sun, high end low end and everything in between. They would leave my skin feeling raw and irritated, and if i havent shaved for a few days, they couldn&#x27;t even remove the hair or they would get stuck and tug at the hair. This double blade razor is unbelievable, goes right through any amount of unshaveness, with zero irritation, just remember to go with the grain.</li>
    <li> Hubby loves it. It comes from Sheffield, England where his family is from. That was a nice surprise. Honestly he said it&#x27;s the closest shave he&#x27;s had with a double edge razor.</li>
    <li> The good: First try with the included blades, resulted in a much better shave than the cheapo disposables I had been using. This razor just cut right through the hair on my neck that the previous razor had trouble negotiating. Nice, heavily built (does the work for you), pretty. Does not clog. I give it five stars for being everything advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The not-so-good: I seem to find it impossible, even with this razor, to get an even, close shave, especially around the chin and angle of the jaw. I had hoped, from the many rave reviews, that this razor would do the job, but still feel stubble under the jawbone. This does better on the flat areas, while the disposable seems better adapted to the curves and angles. That&#x27;s the face I was issued: maybe with practice...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor comes in 3 parts--top cap, base, and handle. I use a shaving cream, and must therefore disassemble it after every use to clean out the large accumulation of gunk from under the blade: a tricky operation in the shower, where dropping a piece might cut something important. I used to have an old Gilette, whose top \\&quot;wings\\&quot; opened, somewhat more convenient. I see such razors for about $10 used on eBay, and may try that route.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor does not seem to clog instantly and simply glide over the hair, as do disposables: it chews through everything in its path. First pass gives an an acceptable shave that would pass muster at work, and is therefore OK in a pinch--it, at least, gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cardboard box is rather a pain to open without tearing in case of needing to return it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The included instructions are a hoot, making glowing reference to Sheffield&#x27;s distinguished history of blade-making: all well and good, but the blades themselves are manufactured in foreign climes.</li>
    <li> So where do I begin....I just bought this razor about 2 weeks ago and am new to this whole DE safety razor thing.  I watched a lot of you tube videos to see how to use it.  Let me tell you I&#x27;m not going to lie I was scared at first thinking it was going to cut up my face like Freddy Kruger!  Actually I got a few nicks at first and some razor burn but by the 4th day I had it mastered and love it!  Stick with it don&#x27;t throw in the towel right away.  It doesn&#x27;t shave any better than a 3 or 5 blade razor BUT it does shave just as good and for A LOT less and that&#x27;s what I love most about it. I also love the feel of shaving with it.  It makes me feel old fashion and like a man.  I can&#x27;t explain the feeling it gives me but for those of you that use a safety razor knows exactly what I mean.  I&#x27;m using Derby blades and really like them.  I have sensitive skin and the Derby are perfect for my skin type and facial hair. The one thing you must know about using a safety razor is that you have to prep your face good.  I use Gillette thermo rub first and then I put art of shaving shaving oil on.  I use a badger brush and either a soap bar or art of shaving shave cream.  I get a great lather with the badger brush.  Then I begin my shave and get a really great shave.  One thing you have to remember with a safety razor and that is take your time it&#x27;s not a rush shave and you will need to make several passes.  Even with my Gillette 5 blade fusion I would have to make several passes, one pass with the grain and one across the grain.  I do the same with my safety razor and get a great shave and just as good as my Gillette 5-blade fusion.  During the week I make two passes because of time but on the weekends I like to make three passes and get an incredible shave.  The three passes are with the grain, across the grain, and against the grain.  I never get razor burn and so far no in grown hairs.  Also, I have not nicked myself since day one. You have to remember to prep your face well.  Ihighly recommend a face scrub first and a shaving oil second and lather up real good third.  After your shave make sure to use a good after shave lotion.  This safety razor is beautiful to look at and the weight of it is really nice. The chrome platting on it is bar far the best. This razor is a classy razor and shaves awesome.  I would have given this razor five stars but the only down fall I have about the razor is the handle is real short.  I wish the handle could have been a little longer and I noticed my stubble comes back in quicker during the day but that could be the blades that I&#x27;m using.  All in all I love this razor and I love shaving with it. I&#x27;m hooked for life!</li>
    <li> The razor arrived a day early, which is great.  The packaging was not sealed well and could have easily opened up in shipping - the ends were just folded in and not taped, which is bad.  The seller could do a better job of packing but it did arrive okay.  I&#x27;ve only used the razor once so far but I&#x27;m very happy with it.  The chrome finish is beautiful to behold, the weight and balance is nice, the vertical grooves in the handle give a decent grip when wet.  The process of unscrewing the handle and taking apart the razor to dry it and the blade after every use id a bit fiddly but perhaps it will become less so with repetition.  I&#x27;ll hold back a star for now since I don&#x27;t know how it will hold up long term, but I have high expectations,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going back to the way I started shacing too many years ago with a DE Razor, Brush and Cream.  I chose this razor due to the feedback from others and they were right!  This is a quality piece that will outlast met.  I have been using it for several weeks with the Derby blades and I can honestly say my shave is as close as I was getting with my old Gillete Fusion.  I just purchased 100 Derby blades for $6.99 from Amazon.  Considering the price of Fusion blade, this is a value.  It took a little getting used to at first, but no real nicks or cuts.  I actually enjoy the ritual in the morning.  I would recommend this razor to anyone who wants to start shaving in this manner.</li>
    <li> This is my first DE razor. There&#x27;s a reason it comes highly regarded. I&#x27;ve used it for a month now it works well.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not that fond of the Derby blades that came with the razor. I found them somewhat harsh. YMMV.</li>
    <li> I used to shave with a straight razor every so often and still use a mach 3 for daily shaving.  My friend got me wanting a DE safety razor after I saw his ( a merkur long handle) so I went ahead and started looking for one myself.  I am very pleased with this razor.  The handle is the perfect length, a little shorter than my friends merkur.  Shaves great with the supplied derby blades and I bought a sample pack of blades so I can try some others.  I don&#x27;t foresee myself going back to multi blade cartridges in the future.  I was even able to shave my head with this razor just fine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this razor for about 6 months and the chrome plating is coming off the head and is very sharp and could scratch my face. I would not buy this brand again.</li>
    <li> The beauty of this product can&#x27;t be explained by anything less than exquisite!  The razor works and performs amazing.  Closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  Would buy 1000 more.</li>
    <li> I started wet shaving a little over a year ago. After much deliberation I initially bought the [[ASIN:B002FC7B2G Merkur Long Handled Double Edge Safety Razor Chrome #180, 10 Double Edge Platinum Blades]] This has been my razor of choice up until two weeks ago when I purchased the Edwin Jagger De89lbl. The Merkur has a longer handle. Great for people with large hands. However, I found that the extra length caused the razor to bounce a bit and not stay flush with my skin at all times. This was especially tough on my neck. To make up for the razor not staying flush I tended to put extra pressure on the razor which lead to some nasty nicks and cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the whole idea to simply allow the razor to do the work I was finding it harder and harder to do so with the Merkur. I assumed this was much to do with operator error but wanted to try a different razor and find out. However, did I really want to spend another $37 on a razor when it could have simply been my technique? Not really. Finally, after much delay, I finally bought the razor listed here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Putting off this purchase was the worst mistake I&#x27;ve made while DE shaving. What a difference this razor makes! It&#x27;s shorter, better balanced, and stays absolutely flush to my face and neck. Three shaves and not a single nick! I use [[ASIN:B001G5HZCY Feather Hi-Stainless Platinum Double Edge Razor Blades 30 Ct]] and the smoothness is amazing. Yes the Feather blades are VERY sharp. This razor comes with five Derby blades and they are where you should start before moving up to the feathers. However, anyone that already has been shaving with a DE razor for a while should be fine with the feathers. Just takes your time and let the razor do the work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to give the Merkur to anyone with larger hands anyone with smaller to medium sized hands should start or upgrade here. Truly the best $37 I&#x27;ve spent all year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My routine:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B004K3QUSE Taconic Shave Unscented Organic Pre-Shave Oil (2 oz.)]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001L2U61E Proraso Shaving Cream With Eucalyptus Oil &amp; Menthol (5.2 oz.)]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B002JW8S6K Bloc Osma Natural Alum Block]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0007XBHIE Proraso Liquid Cream After-Shave (3.4 oz.)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy shaving!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband because he hated shaving and went around looking scruffy most of the time. He watched a lot of videos on youtube about proper technique and then gave it a try. He said that he was probably going to look like he had tangled with a bobcat afterwards but he took his time with the first shave. He said that it is a different kind of shaving and he had to remind himself of the tips from the videos he had watched. WOW did he do a good job! Closest shave he has ever had! No bumps or major irritation at all. He said that his neck and upper lip gave him a little trouble but not nearly as much as his 3 blade disposable and he is very very excited about this razor. He said based on his very first shave that he has No plans to ever go back to using disposable razors again and that he may even get into the whole pre-post shave rituals that his grandfather used to have. How did we ever leave that method of shaving i&#x27;ll never know. FIVE STARS!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have to start with this:  The first time I used this razor, [[ASIN:B002QTX8WU Edwin Jagger Double Edge (DE) Safety Razor - Lined Chrome Handle]], I wanted to run outside and ask complete strangers -- women -- to feel how soft and smooth my face was.  Yes, it was that good and beats all other razors I&#x27;ve used, bar none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor comes packaged in its own box, along with a starter set of five (5) Derby Extra blades.  When I removed the razor from the box, it was beautiful and shiny, with not one nick anywhere on the razor.  It had a weight to it that I was unaccustomed to, having grown up shaving with all the Gillette rip-off cartridge razors from the mid-1970s through part of July of 2012, but it felt just right when I held it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor disassembles to change the blade.  You unscrew the handle from the head and the two finely machined pieces that hold the blade easily separate.  The bottom of the head assembly has two small nubs whose purpose is to position the blade properly in the razor&#x27;s head when you reassemble the razor.  When the blade is seated properly and you reassemble the razor, the blade is held snugly in place with no wiggle room whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this design is superior to the design my father used, with the twist mechanism at the bottom of the handle.  I think the twist design doesn&#x27;t allow a blade to be held as securely and loosens more easily than razor that screws together like this one.  In fact, I think that&#x27;s one reason men who had nothing to shave with but safety razors nearly always drove to work with little pieces of tissue paper on their faces, to soak up blood.  I think another reason for razor cuts back in the day was due to older manufacturing techniques.  I&#x27;m sure the factories that churn out double-edge razor blades have more exacting measurements and tolerances now than they did 40+ years ago.  I also think there were poorer shaving creams available then, too, than there are now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If youread about how to properly shave with a safety razor, you will have no issues with the razor or the blade.  You let the weight of the razor head do all the work.  Voila!  When you run into trouble and your face looks like it was on the losing end of a cat fight, your blade might be too dull, you might be putting too much pressure on the razor head to try to get a closer shave or you&#x27;re doing something else that&#x27;s causing you to have a bad shaving experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word of warning... Do not admire the luster of your razor by running your finger over the top of the razor when you have a blade loaded in it.  Let&#x27;s just say that safety blades are really sharp, cut fast, cut deep, and the result requires a good bit of time to heal.  At least that&#x27;s my story and I&#x27;m stickin&#x27; to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My shaves don&#x27;t take substantially longer than they did when I used the rip-off multi-bladed Gillette razors and blade cartridges. (Did I mention Gillette&#x27;s shaving products, especially its cartridges, are huuuuge rip-offs?)  The one thing I have to do is be very careful shaving around my nose.  One misstep and I need a neck tourniquet for even a minor trespass into the tender areas near and around my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I learned that cutting beard hair is not the major contributor to dulling a blade that many think it is.  It&#x27;s the mineral buildup on blades from the water left on the razor.  After shaving, I wipe down my razor with a towel and then blow-dry the blade to ensure it&#x27;s dry.  My first blade, which was also my previous DE blade, lasted for six weeks or so, give or take a week.  Granted, since my beard is white, I can get away with not always having to shave every day.  However, cleaning and drying a blade after each use definitely prolongs its life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor truly is a display of craftsmanship.  It&#x27;s beautiful to look at and feels like it was made for my face to shave and my hand to hold.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed if you purchase one for yourself.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving for years with a Feather DE butterfly razor because it was cheap and the angle on it wasn&#x27;t harsh. I tried Merkur and Parker models but found their angle too aggressive, if I wasn&#x27;t paying attention it was very easy to leave a mark. Hearing good things about the Edwin Jagger models angle from others I decided to give it a try.  I&#x27;m very impressed so far.  Build quality is excellent - it looks great - and gives me an awesome shave.  The solid &amp; smooth chrome top on the razor has almost a suction effect when using a thick shaving cream, the razor requires minimal effort to match the contours of my face. I highly recommend this razor. If you are new to DR/Safety Razors, pick it up with a pack of feather blades, proraso shaving cream, and Thayers Witch Hazel (use as aftershave) for one of the best shave experiences for the money.</li>
    <li> The razor is truly a work of art and it looks great displayed in my bathroom. The wife doesn&#x27;t even hide it when people come over!  The shaft is too short for my taste but it&#x27;s not enough for me to abandon it, although it offers half as much hand real estate as a typical Mach 3 type razor.  The Derby blades that come with it are ok and pull half as much as a brand new store bought razor. I have yet to try my Feather blades on this but I imagine that it will be an improvement.  I would not recommend this to someone as their first DE razor simply because the short handle provides on unnecessary learning curveball, as is in my case, but it is still far superior to anything Gillette or Schick offers.  Overall, I am sat satisfied and do not have a hint of buyers remorse.</li>
    <li> Nicely constructed with a balanced, weighted feel. The chrome finish is quite handsome, making morning shave feel refined and dignified.</li>
    <li> First and foremost, this is a classy, double edged razor that is especially good for those who are new to DE shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro: This razor has really re-kindled my love for shaving in the morning. I actually look forward to shaving!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: When your hands are wet, it is difficult to get as secure a grip on this razor as I would like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other thoughts: If this is your first time using a double edged razor, don&#x27;t expect to get a perfect shave on the first day. Using a DE, while rewarding, takes more skill than the average cartridge razor.</li>
    <li> Fantastic safety razor for beginners and experienced shavers alike!  I never second guess my decision to begin wet shaving with this razor and know the quality will last!  Seller shipped quickly and would order from them again.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this after the price of razor blades for the new models got so ridiculous. I tried it about a month. It was pretty good and was well made. I hadn&#x27;t used one of these for years, but it was like riding a bike, once you&#x27;ve done it you don&#x27;t  forget. It was a little slower than the new razors but it was fun.&lt;br /&gt;After a month, I tried my old regular new style razor again and it was quite apparent these newer razors are far superior to these old fashioned ones. So as great as this Jagger Razor is, the new razors are superior in my opinion but the blades are far more expensive than those used by the Jagger.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve finally given up on multi blade razors and gone back to a single blade.  I am retired and only shave every three to four days and the longer hairs just clog up my sensor XL, causing me to spend more time cleaning the razor than shaving.  With the Jagger, my shave is much faster and closer and the razor does not clog up.  The Jagger is a beautiful product that shaves very well.  It is not as convenient as a butterfly model, but the three piece design holds the blade securely and there is no play.  Cleaning is simple with no small parts to work around.  I expect the razor will outlast me.  I like the heft of the razor, a change from the plastic ones I have been using.  The head is a little bulky working under the nose but its actually easier to see where you are cutting.  I opted for the standard handle which works well for me as I hold it near the head.  I&#x27;ve nicked myself a few times but not severely or frequently, I am still experimenting with which blades will work best for me.  The included Derby blades are quite satisfactory.  The Jagger is a simple, good looking,  precision tool which does an excellent job and looks like it will last forever.</li>
    <li> and it looks just like the past.  You have probably been wasting your money on those crap 5-blade cartridges like I used to.  Just a bunch of trash for the landfill, and a neck that looks like a Hitchcock film when you&#x27;re done shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You really just need one blade (double sided is just for convenience), and to learn how to use it properly.  Read some blogs, watch a video, or ask your grampa, since your dad might not even remember.  After a little practice, you will be done with the cuts and nicks, you will be saving big bucks on not buying trash cartridges, and you will look like a sophisticated badass while you do it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s becoming more of a rarity, it seems, to be satisfied with what you get for the money you spend. This razor provides one of these rare happy moments for me. It is a solid, well constructed, handsome tool with perfect weight to it. I am still in the process of comparing different blades in it, but Astras and the Derbys that came with it have worked the best for me, so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand that this style of shaving may not be for everyone, but for those who prefer it, I can&#x27;t think of a reason why they would be anything but pleased with this razor.</li>
    <li> Started with the micro touch one razor (as advertised on TV), which was a good razor to start with but after much research I found the Edwin Jagger De89lbl and I couldn&#x27;t be happier! This razor shaves like a champ and as others have already said its a beautiful razor. The difference between how this razor shaves as compared to the micro one is a night and day difference. I highly recommend this razor. Received this razor super fast too!</li>
    <li> Very nice and easy to use.Good bang for the buck.</li>
    <li> I watched a guy review this razor on you tube and I purchased it after his rating. I love it nice quality and it gives me a nice shave.</li>
    <li> not to impressed by the fact that its such a pain to disassemble the whole razor to change blades. The handle is also to short.</li>
    <li> Was surprised to find that this was NOT top-opening,&amp;#34;clamshell&amp;#34; type razor. Changing blades was a finger-danger for me.</li>
    <li> Great shave! Excellent product worth every penny</li>
    <li> Loved this razor, took some time to adjust, to it, but 5 star for craftsmanship. Would reccomend</li>
    <li> Great shave but the handle is slippery and will roll if you&#x27;re not careful.  I&#x27;ve nick myself with this but not with my Merkur 180 as it has a knurled handle and is longer for better &amp;#34;handleability&amp;#34;.  MC</li>
    <li> I have tried several safety razors and some have seemed designed poorly so that the top guard exposes either too much or too little of the blade. The guard on this razor seems makes the shave aggressive enough for a good shave without exposing too much of the blade edge. Other razors have also seemed to rust rather quickly, and this one seems to be holding up well. The length of the handle and the weight of the razor are nice and easy to get used to.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor as my first DE razor based on reviews.  At the time I did not think I had a tough beard but apparently I do.  This razor clogs very quickly/easily.  It pulls on my beard before a razor should.  I&#x27;ve tried it with several blades and no luck. The only way I like shaving with this razor is if I first shave with another razor then do a second or third pass with the Edwin so it has much less hair to deal with.  It simply does not handle my wiry, dense beard at all. I am unfortunately very disappointed and much prefer the Parker 24C.  Although, I am now searching for something that cuts as well as the Parker but closer.</li>
    <li> The razor is good looking and shaves well. However, not very easy to grip when it&#x27;s wet. I&#x27;ve had one break twice now and come close to breaking a few times. I&#x27;ve dropped it many times, especially when using it in the shower.</li>
    <li> Build and quality appears to be okay but upon further inspection there is a spots of missing chrome. Its at the bottom and top of the main post hole on the edge. This will cause the razor to rust out. I have only had this razor for de89l for a week. You buy these razors to last for years. Thought I could expect  more from Edwin Jagger.</li>
    <li> I bought this in the hopes that I would save some cash over the long term. But this thing is too hipster for me. Here&#x27;s my pros/cons list:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;--Well made, looks and feels nice&lt;br /&gt;--Easy to assemble and replace razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;--They don&#x27;t shave for #$%!. I used this thing religiously for a few weeks and every up and down stroke required multiple passes. Perhaps I&#x27;m doing it wrong, but at the age of 30, and as someone who shaves nearly every work day, it shouldn&#x27;t be something I have to work at.&lt;br /&gt;--Not built for speed. Prepare to double your shaving time because this thing takes forever to get use to. I understand that there are several people who have already commented on this, in that it took them time to become familiar with it. But after reading more and more reviews, and watching videos on these blades, I found one thing in common with these folks: they&#x27;re shaving enthusiasts. Look guys, I just need a razor that is easy to shave with in the morning. I need to be done in 5-10 minutes. I don&#x27;t have the time or patience to apply six coats of pre-shave cream, or whip up some fancy shave lather that my animals or kids won&#x27;t get into when I&#x27;m gone. Come on now.&lt;br /&gt;--My hand gets tired using these. Call me whatever girly name you want. Like many men today we&#x27;re accustomed to light-weight, quick-moving razors.This thing had me wanting to put it down after the 15 minutes it took me to shave with it. The weight of this razor doesn&#x27;t belong in the &amp;#34;pro&amp;#34; list.&lt;br /&gt;--You can&#x27;t shave your balls with this thing. Seriously, you think I&#x27;m going to put this ancient razor tech near my Olsen twins? I don&#x27;t think so. Doesn&#x27;t make sense to keep different types of razors around when the first goal was to save money by moving to these razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Listen, don&#x27;t get me wrong. There are many guys who are getting their time and money&#x27;s worth out of these things, but it simply wasn&#x27;t for me. I use the Schick Xtreme 3 Triple Blade. I buy a 10-pack once month that cost around $10 bucks. I can get a quick, smooth, clean, pain-free shave in less than 10 minutes every morning. I don&#x27;t see the problem here.</li>
    <li> I like this razor, but there&#x27;s a big caveat of which you should be aware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to sell this because I discovered that I had a skin allergy to chrome/nickel. The EJ is made from \\&quot;pot metal\\&quot; which is cheap, low grade metal and is given a coating of chrome which contains nickel. After shaving with it for a bit, I noticed that I was getting bumps on my neck and cheeks; not weepers (i.e., ingrown hairs), just bumps.  I didn&#x27;t get them with my all stainless steel razor or my antique Gillette NEW.  I realized eventually that it was the nickel in the chrome plating that was giving me skin dermatitis when using the EJ.  So, while this is a very good razor, you should stay away from it and other chrome plated types (such as Merkur, etc.) if you have an allergy to nickel or chrome.  For me, I&#x27;m sticking with an all stainless steel razor.</li>
    <li> After reading a lot of reviews, most of which that suggest one should own both the [[ASIN:B000NL0T1G Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor]] and the Edwin Jagger, I decided to take them up on the suggestion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, I highly recommend getting the \\&quot;lined\\&quot; handle for the Jagger. I can&#x27;t imagine how slippery the thing must be without grooves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I compared the Edwin Jagger with the [[ASIN:B001G5FOLI 10 Feather Razor Blades NEW Hi-stainless Double Edge]] to the Merkur 180 with the Merkur Blades. It was a landslide in favor of the Edwin Jagger. More comfortable shave, and insanely close. The blade just slides right across the face and handles curvature a lot better. The only thing the Merkur 180 has the edge on is for those weird hair spots where you have to shave sideways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, I then put a [[ASIN:B001OXTHJC Astra Superior Platinum Double Edge Razor Blades - 30 Ct]] into my Merkur and the competition was a whole bunch closer. The Merkur with the Astra blade had a very \\&quot;smooth\\&quot; feel, and this combination is probably the best out there for preventing razor burn; something the Merkur/Merkur combo did cause rarely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I still love both my razors. I take the Merkur 180/Astra combo on the road and use the Edwin Jagger/Feather combo for at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I would also recommend owning both a Merkur and an Edwin Jagger to see what works for you.</li>
    <li> I know what you&#x27;re saying - a razor, beautiful?  Yes.  The machining on this is excellent and the chrome is bright. A bathroom tool that draws the eye.  Excellent balance and control for my wide hands.  With Personna or Feather blades, one can&#x27;t get a better shave.</li>
    <li> Have had this razor for 4 years and still works like day one. Beautifully made and perfect form factor. I will never go back to modern razors.</li>
    <li> I switched from using mach 3 and Fusion Pro glide, to this Safety razor, it has been amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took a little while to get the shaving perfected, but it is definitely worth it, by purchasing blades in 100 package counts, it has practically paid for itself already with all the money saved from buying cartridges for the other razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The look and feel has a great quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are thinking of switching to Safety Razor, this is a great option!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many safety razors and this has been the best ever.  Not too aggressive and not too weak.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it would have better grip if the grip was knurled like other models instead of the lines from top to bottom.</li>
    <li> This razor gives me the closest, smoothest shave ever.</li>
    <li> i usually use the gillette razors to line up n shave but i have a better control n sharper look with this razor. Pretty light but sturdy. Its like a fresh shave from my barber, winning!! Recommended highly</li>
    <li> This is the best razor I have ever had!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a parker straight razor but I used to cut my self and have enough skin burns for a month although I needed to shave once a week. I don&#x27;t have too coarse hair neither rough skin. However, once I bought this one, NOTHING bad at all! and the face felt like there was no hair grew there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like when I dry it; it stays as shiny as I first unboxed it. Not only that, here is more:&lt;br /&gt;1- once you rinse it in warm water, it stays and still feels warm on the skin&lt;br /&gt;2- I once dragged it the direction of the razor and I prepared to &amp;#34;faint&amp;#34; as usual, but viola ! not a single scratch.&lt;br /&gt;3- It shaves as close as a straight razor (you need to wash face with cleansing soap, dry it, make the thick foam, brush it &amp;#34;circularly&amp;#34; on the face so that the hair keeps standing by the thick foam and then use the razor, you will be stunned by results and after shave comfort).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A healthy product for healthy shaving worth every single penny I paid.</li>
    <li> I used to be an electric shaver nut. In college, I felt I didn&#x27;t have the time to lather up and shave, so I always dealt with the ghastly midnight look from electric razors. I came across a forum that talked about the benefits (and how cool it was) of double edged razors, and finally picked one up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holy crap! The initial investment was fairly high, but still cheaper than an electric razor. And actually, the preparation, lather and shaving actually felt like a luxury. The results were horrible and the worst, but after a few days I tried again and actually had a decent look. Now I am able to shave and look like a competent denizen of the world, and it&#x27;s still running below the cost of my last electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin, so I was worried about razor burn, however Proraso offers many sensitive-skin options, and this has long become an issue of the past. My skin is very smooth now after shaving, and I even find myself excited for the next time I can take the time out to shave, as it&#x27;s actually very relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re new to this, watch a few youtube videos, google search around and you&#x27;ll find an entire world dedicated to this type of stuff. It&#x27;s actually quite disturbing.</li>
    <li> Even though this is a heavy razor it is easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glides smoothly over your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The indentations on the edge of the razor stop the shaving cream from clogging and works really well with a heavy stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is just the right length for a good grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cuts close for a great shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks and feels like a quality razor should.</li>
    <li> is what I like and this product fits perfect to my style. Looks like it will last a lifetime so if it does it will really save me on cost from buying all those crappy disposable razors. Much better shave than any cheap razor from the stores. The big marketing razor companies made us believe we need 4, 5, 6 razor to shave with. What a bunch of crock! This one safety razor works way better. This razor will pay for it self in a few months. Trust me! buy this razor cause it will be the last one you will ever have to buy. And you will feel like a real man after you are done shaving. Buy a brush with some manly cream too!!!</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves this razor, and it has helped tremendously with razor burn due to his sensitive skin type!! Great purchase!</li>
    <li> It looks great, it works great, its easy to clean, what more could you ask? Do yourself a favor and break away from this Merkur craze. This razor is beautifully chromed, has a nice weight to it, and is medium aggressive. Many people complain about the grip being vertical and not really helping. This is an issue only if your hand gets VERY soapy. However, the surface is fairly sticky, so you will probably have no issue holding it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very highly recommended by me.</li>
    <li> Love being able to shave &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This is an old fashioned razor with a single double edged blade.  My husband really likes it. The blades are so much more reasonable than those replacement blades for all the razors on the market  in stores now.</li>
    <li> If you are new to safety razors, I recommend getting a quality sampler pack of blades to go with this. Every face is different and blades make a big difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this razor. Much easier for me to use than the straight razor I got a few years back.</li>
    <li> Great gift! My son loved it! Uses it every day!. Received it in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> A long time user of store bought 2, 3 5, 6 blade razors with shave foam.  I&#x27;m a noob when it comes to DE razor with Oil and wanted to see what all the hoopla was about. So I purchased Edwin Jagger DE89Lbl  DE razor and Shave Secret Oil. I never knew my skin would feel so smooth and a razor cut so close. And not one cut. I threw my other Walmart razors and foam in the garbage &#x3D;). Very impressed and sorry it took me so long to see the light. The DE89Lbl is heavy duty and looks like a piece of art and the Chrome is high quality. I&#x27;m sold</li>
    <li> I dropped from 120 cm (47 in) and it broke.</li>
    <li> Today I shaved with a double edged safety razor for the first time in well over three decades.  It was a cleaner smoother shave than I have ever gotten from the single blade Bic disposables which I had been using.  I cannot compare this razor to others, but it is very well made, of fine appearance and excellent function.  I would recommend this razor.  I would also recommend Kiehl&#x27;s White Eagle Brushless Shave Cream.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband, he is in LOVE with it!</li>
    <li> Very well crafted piece of engineering, as you would expect from being made in England. This razor works great for me, with Wilkinson Classic, or Feather blades. The Derby that shipped with it drag and pull to much for me.</li>
    <li> This razor looks really good and appears to be high quality. I have been using this razor as my travel shaver for a few months. I usually shave twice using a safety razor, shaving only one time will not get all of the whiskers. I use Barbasol shaving cream which works just fine. The razors I use are Derby and seem to work great and I have never cut myself. I got into safety razor&#x27;s to save money, I have about 3-4 years worth of blades for the cost of 3 months of the 5 blade rip off modern shavers. I also like the old school shaver like that of my father&#x27;s. I highly recommend this Safety Razor and also the Merkur.</li>
    <li> An amazingly Beautiful Razor! The Crome is flawless!  Glides over your face!  Only problem I have is that I have one of the toughest thickest beards and it takes me 4-5 passes to get the way I want but for regular beards its Perfect!  Smooth smooth shave once fineshed! Feels great in hand not ovely heavy and biggenough handel for everyone!</li>
    <li> after searching all over the net,going through various reviews...finally bought this product.this is my first safety razor,and its perfect.I was so worried and scared that i may end up getting several cuts etc,since always had used 3 blade/4 blade products....but i was left surprised...two weeks of regular shaving and hardly any cuts or nicks...plus the free blades was nice!and yea a much much much better and smooth shave!</li>
    <li> This razor is well made and although I&#x27;ve only used it once so far, I feel it will last for years.  However, I did not realize that this product does not open like an American product by twisting on a ring on the bottom of the razor.  Rather, it opens by twisting the top off.  Be careful not to cut your fingers.</li>
    <li> Beautiful perfect construction, perfect blade alignment, outstanding smooth shaving. The handle is a bit longer than the Merkur 1904 42C and shaves just as well. Get one while you can as its a must have double edge razor.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor on a recommendation from a review and I am not disappointed. My first shave with this razor was incredible.  I used the Israeli Personna Red Blades and I was impressed.  No nicks or cuts and I was able to get an almost smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt shave but I was in a hurry. I applied mineral oil after washing my face and then lather from brush and shaving cup. Two pass procedure, with the grain and against the grain. NICE NICE Shave! I have a Merkur Futur which did not give as good a shave although to be fair I haven&#x27;t tried it with the Israeli blades.</li>
    <li> I have always figured I was a man with sensitive skin. I always get razor bumps, rashes, and a burning feeling when using Gillette Fusion, Schick, all the different types with and without battery. All the sensitive skin shaving gels, creams, etc. Nothing ever really worked. I even took to growing a beard during the winter months just to avoid shaving. Then I came upon the Double Edge Razor. On that day, I became a man. I received the package with the Derby&#x27;s which I considered to be a good starter. I bought some shaving soap[[ASIN:B001JHEY14 Proraso Shaving Soap, Ultra Sensitive Skin 5.2 oz (147 g)]] and had a brush[[ASIN:B004L4AMIQ Van Der Hagen Men&#x27;s Luxury, Badger Brush, 3-Ounce]] I had gotten as a gift. I also bought a wooden stand [[ASIN:B001XURHIY Colonel Conk Wooden Shave Brush &amp; Razor Stand Mens]]here on Amazon. I have to say the first time I thought I&#x27;d cut myself and was prepared for a gash but I took my time (first time you cannot rush, please take your time) and my face was smoother than I have ever seen. I literally was as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom. I now understand where that saying came from. It only took a few strokes to do my face. Please keep your water off as you shave for the first time. The scraping sound of the blade upon your face is surprising at first. You will be shocked at how much hair your hair has as you wash the blade for the first time. My skin came out perfect! I put on a little aftershave cream [[ASIN:B00493ZX0G SoftSheen-Carson Magic Bump Rescue, 3.8 oz.]] and my face has since not had one bump or rash! I kid you not, my wife is in love with my razor. I will say that after the first two shaves I decided to move on to the [[ASIN:B001G5FOLI 10 Feather Razor Blades NEW Hi-stainless Double Edge]]. These are MUCH sharper but with time and patience I have yet to get a cut at all and somehow they will give you the best shave you&#x27;ve ever had- this razor will show you where the saying thin as a razor came from. They&#x27;re that thin.  PROS * Heavy Handle - No need to apply pressure. Just let the razor glide on your face the first couple times. (As you realize all this time disposables have conditioned us to hammer our faces, your touch becomes lighter)    *Gorgeous chrome finish -It says on their site it&#x27;s by the same people who do the chrome on Rolls Royce cars. Not sure if that&#x27;s true but it definitely looks the part    *Easy to install razor in and out. You just hold it by the sides and pop it in and screw.  CONS- None, there are no moving parts. This will not break or wear with proper care. Make sure to dry your razor and keep it clean. Mine looks as nice as the day I got it    *You will become addicted to buying real razors and blades. They are just so much cheaper for a much better shave. Even the soap will last as long as five bottles at least of shaving gel.    *Your wife will always want to touch your face -Make her wash her hands first!</li>
    <li> I researched a number of razors and this one got good recommendations.  I&#x27;ve used it about three weeks and highly recommend it.  Sellers delivered in a timely manner too.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I feel like everyone else that reviewed this, the feel of the razor as well as the shave is really nice. I was worried after first because my hands are huge and it isn&#x27;t, but one I stopped thinking about it, it was fine. On another note though, I also bought the two dollar Chinese version, I don&#x27;t like the feel of how it unscrew but other than that same thing.  So, big bucks, or little bucks.  Guess it all comes down to how much you want to spend. In the end they all take the same razor blade I guess    12/12/13. Well it&#x27;s been awhile and the razor has been fine, a little short in the handle but not too bad.  Then yesterday I dropped it, it hit the floor and that ended that!  Over, goodbye, so long, no more love.  I guess it is what it is, and I know they aren&#x27;t made to be dropped but guess what it happens.  Because of the weight which is good and the design when it drops it is Very likely to break the head screw off in the handle and that ends it.  Now I know, and so do you!</li>
    <li> I got this early, and it looks, feels, and shaved great. The handle can become slippery though if you aren&#x27;t careful with the rinsing. Also I knocked it off a ledge and it broke right of where it attaches to the head, my own fault. I figured I would try another model and brand just to switch things up. Will update after a few months to compare.</li>
    <li> Built like a chrome plated tank, perfectly balanced and designed, does exactly what it&#x27;s intended to do. I wish everything was built this well.</li>
    <li> I have just finished my 2nd shave with this razor and I am glad that I bought it. I used a Derby blade for both shaves, and used a double pass with the grain. My skin is baby soft with no irritation, and I have not nicked myself at all. I always seemed to nick myself with a disposable razor. Maybe I just take my time more with this DE razor and focus more on my technique. I&#x27;m sure there are probably better razors out there for more money, but I think this one is worth every penny. I would recommend it to other first time DE razor users as it is good enough quality to give you a great shave from the start, but inexpensive enough to not be a financial commitment if you don&#x27;t like this style of shaving.</li>
    <li> This was the first safety razor that I have ever used, and I have to say that I will never be going back to disposables or that 5 blade commercialized trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to be solidly built, but is just a tad too small for my hands.  Other than that I have been quite happy with it and plan on keeping it until it breaks.</li>
    <li> This product is great, love how sturdy it feels in your hand. Disposable razors always irritated my face and I don&#x27;t like having to pay so much to keep changing the blades.</li>
    <li> This was my first safety razor that I used and I feel it is a great introduction razor for those looking to ditch cartridges.  There is less risk of nicks using this razor compared to some others that I now own.  The finish still looks great after a year, barely looks like its been used at all.  If you are looking to see if you like shaving with these types of razors, this a great introduction for a great price.</li>
    <li> Well made, shaves great if you take your time.  Handle a little slippery when wet, could also be a little longer to provide a better grip.  Otherwise great shaver.</li>
    <li> I like the product a lot.  Love the fact that the replacement blades are about 0.50 cents compared to $2-3 dollars per Mach 3 blade.  The only real issue I have is that it is hard to change the blades without getting cut.  I&#x27;ve cut my self really deep while holding the blades and trying to put it in place.  May be I am just a newbie, but they need to make it easier, I literally slashed my finger while trying to remove the old blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I don&#x27;t know if there is a proper way of putting the blade in.  Does it matter if it is facing up or down?</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful razor. I have liked the shaves with it so far. The weight is nice, it&#x27;s a hefty razor.</li>
    <li> Love this razor! quality made to last. Feels good in your hand and saves a bunch of money on razors per year. Great shave!</li>
    <li> For the first time in over 45 years I have a razor that gives me a close and clean shave.  I find it remarkable that individuals who don&#x27;t know how to use a safety razor and don&#x27;t want to learn how to use one properly are the ones that complain the loudest and give negative reviews.  Come on people ... learn how to use it!!  It took me a couple of weeks and a few nicks and scrapes but it&#x27;s now giving me the smoothest shave of my life WITHOUT cuts.  I love it.  Best of all, it&#x27;s a lot cheaper in the long run than those other razors out there and a lot less confusing trying to find blades.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor now for about 20 months and like many of the reviews, I find that this is probably the best razor that I have ever bought. It holds the blade just like it should be held, it doesn&#x27;t come loose, it cleans up nicely, it doesn&#x27;t slip around in the hand while shaving and it has a great heft and feel to it. If you want to start using a double edge razor, you really cannot go wrong with this product. I am really glad that I purchased this razor when I did. I find that when paired with the Feather blade, it delivers a clean, solid shave, time after time.</li>
    <li> My Jagger razor is probably more heavily chromed than my Merkur. It is a nice looking implement, both are.  I took it for a test tour of my face today and did not get nicked. I&#x27;ve been shaving with a double edge blade for the last month or so, so I&#x27;ve probably re-learned how to use one. Used one for three or four years then started looking for an easier way when I was 19.  I&#x27;ve tried electrics several times. Usually quit using them because I would have to touch up areas with a blade anyway. They do not shave as close as a blade and if you use a pre-electric potion you pretty much have to wash it off, negating the &#x27;dry shave&#x27; convenience of the electrics. I&#x27;ve used many of the disposables and multi-blade razors. They do make it easy. They do make it pricey. Back in 1984 I think, Gillette had a shave cream dispenser with a built-in brush. I tried a couple of them with not much reason to continue. I bought a brush and some cheap Williams hard soap at the drugstore. Didn&#x27;t work too well.  In fairness, with the brush schemes I was trying to learn them myself, information wasn&#x27;t as easy to access as it is today. The Gillette built-in brush thing apparently didn&#x27;t have too many repeat customers. I don&#x27;t think it was around even a year. I might be the only person who bought two of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t have one, get a brush to use with the Jagger. I bought a Tweezerman here for under ten bucks. It has badger bristles and works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something I read somewhere really works well for me. I put the shave brush in very hot water in a coffee mug. While it&#x27;s marinating I wash my face. Then shake the water off the brush and dump the water out of the coffee mug, put just enough hot water to cover the bottom of the mug back in, as hot as you can get it. Swirl the brush tips around about a quarter-sized amount of shaving cream in the mug, I&#x27;ve been using Proraso. Then fill your lavatory  a little more than half full with the hottest water you can. Put the mug with the brush and shaving cream in the hot water in the lavatory. You can still run hot water on your razor if you want or just swish it around in the lavatory hot water on the side not occupied by the mug/soap/brush (you don&#x27;t want water from the sink slopping into the mug and diluting the soap). The nice thing is, rather than risk slicing or abrading your face, when you want to go over an area again you just take the brush out of the cup. The shaving cream will be very warm. If you keep doing that, keeping shaving soap on your face before going over an area, and paying attention to what you&#x27;re doing you can shave blood free, cheaper and probably closer than with the expensive cartridges. If you are thinking about switching from those to a DE and decide to keep using the multi-blade cartridges, you should still consider the brush-soap-cup-in-the-sink  tactic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 10/20/12&lt;br /&gt;I bought another one of these after my brother saw mine when he visited the other day. He has been duly warned that there is a (fairly short) learning curve. The razor, as with the first one, shipped fast and free. You can&#x27;t beat these people to do business with. Can&#x27;t say I won&#x27;t end up buying a third one of these, if I buy a fourth, I&#x27;ve got a problem. Nice product. Nice people to buy from.</li>
    <li> First, I&#x27;m 64 years old, I know dougle edge razors, I&#x27;m also a woman. I purchased this razor for my husband. He is bedridden, and I have to do the shaving for him. I have been through dozens and dozens of \\&quot;plastic\\&quot; razors, better, more expensive, \\&quot;plastic\\&quot; razors, and just about anything I could get my hands on, to give my husband a decent shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I remembered when I used to watch my father shave, and it&#x27;s then, that I remembered his good old double edged razor, that was always sharp, and always worked perfectly. Ok, so I come to Amazon and search. I wanted a good one, but was not going to put out a lot of money, because of everything being made so cheap these days. (been there, done that)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boy was I ever shocked, the first time I put the Edwin Jagger De89lbl razor to my husbands face!!! When I slid that razor across my husbands face, it was like gliding on smooth ice. It slid right down his face without a single nudge, bump, or hiccup. I swear, I could have cried!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;I DID IT! I had found the one,\\&quot; the razor that finally fixed a year of frustration. My husband got the most perfect shave he has had in years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realize this all sounds really corny, stupid, or whatever, but I&#x27;m so relieved at finding a TRUELY WONDERFUL RAZOR for my husband, I decided to tell my story, the way it really happened, and how I felt about an honestly GOOD PRODUCT. The Edwin Jagger razor is fantastic, I intend to buy one for myself, and in a couple months, my 3 sons, my son-in-law, and daughter, will all be getting one for Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m tickled pink with this razor! You will be too!</li>
    <li> This is my first experience with a double edged razor.  And I&#x27;m loving it.  This is gorgeous and effective.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I decided to switch from your typical disposable razor, I&#x27;m have never gotten this close of a shave with the other products and it&#x27;s less expensive in the long run. I&#x27;m very happy with this product and I plan to buy more of these for the holidays and give them away as gifts.</li>
    <li> I must admit that despite being an avid Amazon customer for almost as long as it has been in business, I have never posted a review for any of the products.  I have been tempted to do so with several books and CDs/MP3s, but those sometimes degrade into fan boy vs. elitist banter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Edwin Jagger De89lb De Razor prompted me to post a review because as one other reviewer put it it is \\&quot;life changing\\&quot;.  Admittedly, this is my first DE, but it certainly won&#x27;t be my last as I have a bit of the collector bug for things I enjoy - and that word is key.  You see, I have never enjoyed shaving.  To me, it has been akin to cutting the grass - a never-ending cycle of drudgery that more often than not resulted in skin irritation and ingrown hairs.  I accepted this through the years as part of the process until I started getting that smattering of salt-and-pepper in my beard.  With the seeming change of coarseness of my facial hair as I have aged, the irritation and frequency of ingrown hairs increased to an almost intolerable state.  I have been fortunate to have been able to work from home quite a bit over the last year, thus the frequency of shaving decreased enough to let my neck heal a bit between shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, through all this torture I had been using any of the latest and greatest eleventy-billion bladed leviathan that I thought might be the holy grail of shaving for me.  Little did I know the answer was much more simple and low-tech.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a few weeks ago, I scheduled a flight to the home office to meet the new CIO. Quite an important face-to-face for me.  As luck would have it, I shaved with my latest failed experiment and the result was the absolute WORST irritation and ingrown hair that I have ever experienced.  It was so bad, I hated to go out in public.  During one of my Brazilian Jiu Jitsu matches, I tapped not because of the choke was set in deep, but because the abrasion on the ingrown hair was horrifically painful (I have quitea high pain tolerance at that).  I began to fear that the ingrown hair was so severe that it might keep me looking like a mutant on my trip, and that was not a good first impression for me to leave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading several forums filled with men that had the same problem, almost all resolved their issues by going back to what their fathers and grandfathers used in lieu of the latest cartridge razors.  More research prompted me to purchase the Edwin Jagger De89lbl along with the [[ASIN:B004L4EING Van Der Hagen Men&#x27;s Luxury, Shave Set]] as this was touted as a good mid-priced DE setup for beginners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here I am two weeks later and my face is almost back to normal.  I am back to shaving at least every other day with the Edwin Jagger.  Not only is my face much less prone to irritation, but I have found that I enjoy the ritual - the \\&quot;ME\\&quot; time.  Shaving almost seems therapeutic in a sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife and child were terrified that I would cut myself the first time out, but I followed some of the other reviews of this particular DE, and it&#x27;s true; the weight is sufficient therefore DO NOT apply pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Certainly, I still have more to learn regarding the art of shaving, but this product provided me with a good price entry point and a set of training wheels.  In addition, my neck no longer looks like inspiration for a new villain in an X-Men comic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are having problems with bumps and ingrown hairs, don&#x27;t take forever to try DE shaving like I did.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple years now and it has been fantastic. I will never go back to disposable razors. Before with multi-bladed disposable razors I would get razor burn and ingrown hairs on my neck but since switching to a safety razor I haven&#x27;t had any issues. I have noticed that if I go a few days without shaving my thick hair will clog the closed comb more easily so you might want to go with an open comb if you have thicker hair but it doesn&#x27;t really bother me. Perfect weight and feel in your hand, just use a quality blade with this and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I bought this as I recently switched to wet shaving. I think it does a good job and thus the 4 stars. The reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars as that the finish looks a little scuffed or like there is residue after a few uses. Haven&#x27;t really tried to polish it and it doesn&#x27;t affect my use of the razor. I may need to do some cleaning to make it look nicer but I didn&#x27;t buy it so I would have to do more work maintaining it (It&#x27;s a razor!).</li>
    <li> I thought I was making a smart purchase based upon the reviews.  After 5 months the handle fell off.  Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> I am an active duty Marine and shaving is a must for our appearance. I was blowing about $40 a month on razors for my Mach 3 shaver and felt trapped. Well this product was my shaving savior. The initial buy is a bit pricey but razors are so affordable you can literally use one a day and spend about $27 for the entire year.</li>
    <li> Surprised my spouse with this.  He loves it and uses it every day.</li>
    <li> Flawless chrome finish. Nice weight. Smooth shaving. Affordable. I have no complaints with this razor.</li>
    <li> About 1 year into this product.  I really like the build quality and the metal plating seems nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The threads seem to be holding up really well. At first I was concerned I might crossthread it by accident because I wasn&#x27;t sure how soft the metal was.</li>
    <li> Actually i did like this razor BUT today unfortunately i dropped it (after the third time that i have used it ) and it broke , the connection screw broke inside from the end ...</li>
    <li> I recieved the Jagger DE89, on a sunday, so I had several days of growth on my face.  The razor worked well with minimal pressure and I only needed 2 passes, one down and one up, to get a shave that was better than using a mach 5.  I did nick myself several times, once was bad enough to require a styptic pen, but that is to be expected when you&#x27;re trying a razor that is angled differently than what you are accustom to.  Being in the military I have to shave everyday, and it&#x27;s always a painful end to my weekends! I tend to shave at night just in case I nick myself really good I have plenty of time to get the bleeding to stop. So, the extra couple minutes of shaving isn&#x27;t a bother. There are two reasons why I say it&#x27;s a better shave than the Mach 5 or any of those brands; first, it didn&#x27;t pull on my wiskers, it just cut right through them, and secondly, the next morning there was no noticable irritation, bumps or redness which I have grown used to over the years.  I would deffinitly reccomend that anyone interested in buying one of these should check out the instructional videos on youtube, before you put this razor to your face!  I&#x27;m glad I did. I believe the military named these, because there is nothing safe about any razor blade!</li>
    <li> I should start off by saying that this was my first safety razor so I can&#x27;t compare it to others. As so many other reviewers have pointed out, it gave me a good close shave, it looks elegant, and I was happy. The problem happened when I dropped it. The screw part in the head snapped in two and it became a useless chunk of metal. I bought one again thinking that I was unlucky with the first one. I just dropped it again and it broke in the exact same way. Edwin Jagger needs to make more durable razors. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this unit and I&#x27;m not going to be tricked a third time.</li>
    <li> This is a well made high quality razor!  It is more aggressive than I like or require (I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard growth).  For a heavy beard I think this razor would be fantastic!  However, for a lighter beard I use a Parker 99R which is my favorite razor.</li>
    <li> Great. Until it fell and broke !!</li>
    <li> A finely crafted product.  Still learning to use it, but I am pleased with the quality and craftsmanship.  A good feel in my hand.  Just heavy enough to give a close shave without applying pressure like I had to with the typical multi-blade razor.  The handle length is just right, too.  Nicely packaged and a starter pack of blades was a nice touch.</li>
    <li> Love this piece. I was always a disposable razor guy until a friend of mine turned me onto the safety razor movement. Picked up this piece, along with a good shaving cream and a brush, and I&#x27;ll never look back.</li>
    <li> I had a Parker before this but it had some alignment issues. I got this and wish I had started here. This is not an aggressive razor. Great balance and weight. Easy to hold with wet hands. The razor itself is beautiful. Perfect chroming, no doubt about that. I&#x27;m a beginning wet shaver/ DE shaver and I think this is the only razor I&#x27;ll ever own. Badger and Blade kind of guys usually own many but this is also usually one of them (some even have multiples with different handles. Fight the AD!) whether adding to a collection, starting off or simply needing a good razor to last you forever, this should fit the bill nicely. I paid $31 for it but it could easily go for more. The one thing I will note is that the handle doesn&#x27;t align as easily as the parker (and presumably other razors), meaning a little care will go a long way in preserving the threads so they are not stripped. I like it with Astra SP blades but I&#x27;m also searching around (I do really like the SP&#x27;s). I don&#x27;t there is a better or safer choice with a razor. People also recommend the Merkur something or other. I can&#x27;t remember. I thought I would be a razor buying machine but I haven&#x27;t really thought of getting another since this one is so stellar. I really don&#x27;t think you can go wrong with this beautiful razor.  Again as a first razor you may also want to check out the Merkur, I think it&#x27;s the HD or 34c? I&#x27;ve never used it but I would just say get this thing!</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this razor.  It&#x27;s significant weight gives it a great heft and hand-feel.  It shaves close - almost as close as a straight blade.  I like using the Derby blades the best, though I&#x27;ve only tried them and the Sharks.  The main reason I purchased this was to allow me to shave &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; close every day.  Using my straight just takes too long.  I can shave with this in about half the time as with my straight with almost identical results.  When I&#x27;m not in a hurry, I break out the straight razor.  Most days, though, the Jagger can&#x27;t be beat.  I recommend this razor with reservation.  I have found no negative aspects to it.</li>
    <li> This razor gives a better shave than any triple blade.  A sooth cut without iritation. Blades are inexpensive so can be replaced frequently.</li>
    <li> the best shave I ever got from a razor.</li>
    <li> I own a number of old Gillette razors and a Merkur 1904 open comb, not to mention the straights. This is the smoothest shaver of them all. I know a lot of folks say it&#x27;s very mild, and maybe it is, but after a 3 pass shave over my coarse beard, I&#x27;m Baby Butt Smooth and nick free. The balance of the head and handle is perfect. I found this razor works excellent for me with both Gillette silver blue and Feather blades. I&#x27;ve never lost grip on the handle. To avoid cutting yourself when changing blades, pinch it in-line longways with your thumb and forefinger on he top and bottom of the head when the razor is dry and not soapy and twist the handle CCW. Don&#x27;t over-torque it when you tighten it down. After you shave, loosen the head the same way, rinse it under the sink, then blow the water out and hang it to dry. I wipe my razor down with a microfiber cloth every now and again, especially if I&#x27;m in a place with really hard water (FLA), but up here in MD the hard water deposits and soap scum seem to be a non-issue. I bought one of these for my wife to shave her legs with because I love the head on here so much. ***UPDATE*** now 3 stars. Was 5. I dropped this razor in the shower the other day, and the threaded post on the head broke off in the handle. This was the first time the razor had been dropped. The razor is made of cheap pot metal, and not as durable as a solid brass razor. I ordered a Parker 98R to replace it. The Parker is a little more aggressive, roughly the same size handle as the EJ, but is solid brass and much heavier.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t agree more with these reviews. This is one of those rare, semi-obscure products that is both better than the common version of what it replaces (e.g. mach 3, quattro, etc.) and is also cheaper (in the long run). In other words, you can&#x27;t lose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;100 blades, which I&#x27;d expect to last me 5 years, costs $8, compared to $2-3/blade/month with mach3 ($125-180 over 5 years). So, even though these razors cost $20-30 more up front, it&#x27;ll save you a c-bill or two in the long run. I&#x27;ve only had it a day, but with this kind of heft and only 3 pieces, it feels like it&#x27;ll last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, for people thinking about switching from mainstream multiblade disposable razors, it&#x27;s a no-brainer based on cost alone. But not only is it cheap, great looking and ergonomic (for my relatively small hands), it shaves really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no need to apply pressure or pull it down your face. Just guide it and gravity will do the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I don&#x27;t have the breadth of experience in DE razors that some other reviewers do, based on the above math and the quality of the shave, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a steal at up to five times the price I paid ($36).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can only think of one potential caveat: if they stopped to look, the TSA would likely object to bringing a &amp;#34;loaded&amp;#34; razor in your carryon.</li>
    <li> As the number of blades goes up in modern razors, and as the price goes crazy for refills, I thought it would be fun to go back to one of these.  I use a brush and shaving soap now too. It&#x27;s really enjoyable and the shave is just as good as the new multi blade models.  At first you might cut yourself (get s syptic pencil) but after one week I never cut myself. Probably just learning the parts of my fact to be careful with.</li>
    <li> I got this razor about a month ago. It is very nicely built and high quality. All of that talk you hear about the quality of a double edge safety razor shave seems to have some merit. This seems to do the job quite a bit better than cheap-o disposables or expensive 5 blade razors. Also you feel pretty boss weilding this hefty piece of machinery around your face like your grandpa and great grandpa did. Manly. My favorite part of shaving with this would have to be how the metal heats up and retains heat during your shave. feels nice on the face. This razor looks way better than comparable mekur razors in my opinion. Go for it.</li>
    <li> Purchased this razor after watching Geofatboy shaving with it on youtube. I have been using a 1905 Gillette open comb razor since I started wet shaving about a year ago and I love the the idea of shaving with something that generations of my family have used to shave with. I had some sentimental attachment to the razor since it has been in our family since new. I decided to purchase the Edwin Jagger De89lbl with chrome lined detail and when I received it I was very impressed with the heft and craftsmanship.Very nice workmanship and beautiful chroming. No tooling marks. No trouble gripping the wet razor since the grooves provide a little bit of grip. About the shave. I was hesitant at first but after the first pass I knew I wouldnt be going back to the vintage Gillette. The shave I get with this razor with a feather blade is comfortable and smooth with very little skin irritation. Very pleasant experience and I find I can shave a little quicker and not worry about cutting my face up.&lt;br /&gt;Sent this razor and some Geo F. Trumper coconut shave cream to my son in the Navy. I know he&#x27;ll like it too.</li>
    <li> This little guy blew away my expectations.  I&#x27;ll probably use this razor until I die.</li>
    <li> This is my first DE safety razor and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it. It has a nice solid feel, good weight, and has provided a great experience to my entry into wet shaving. The chrome is in great condition after a couple of months use. I like the ridged handle as I think it helps give a more secure grip, or at least gives that impression.</li>
    <li> My husband loves his razor. He is so happy to be shaving with an old fashioned style razor.</li>
    <li> Been many years since I used one but the DE razor works like a charm. Also save big $$$ not buying $4 blades, blades are now $10 per 100.</li>
    <li> I believe I ordered Razor Sunday, its now Tuesday and is here. Since I needed a shave I imediately tried it out and it worked very well for my condition. I am right handed and broke my right wrist in recentley and have been shaving with my left hand. Razor worked fine, and I believe closer shave, but right hand didn&#x27;t work so well. When I opened it to clean I dropped it and quickly reached for it and the blade cut my right index finger at the tip and blood all over  the place. I am not blaming it on the razor. I thought the handle would be a little longer but I will get used to it. Also the solid brass handle makes the razor a little heavy since I am used to plastic throwaways. If in manufacturing it, the threaded hole could  bored almost to the other end that would lighten the razor. I am sure after the feeling comes back in my right hand and fingers  it will be fine. Ordered the 100 pack of Derby blades with it on recommendation of several reviewers and I believe they are sharper than the two on my plastic throwaways. .</li>
    <li> love the shave I get from this razor but the handle is too short for my liking + it&#x27;s slippery in my hand.  Polished chrome may not be the best design out there.  I have since gifted it to my brother and now use the Feather AS-D2.  a lot more expensive but it works great for me.</li>
    <li> Fabulous razor.  Beautiful to look at, a pleasure to hold and it delivers a nice smooth shave.  After watching Geofatboy&#x27;s review on YouTube, I was convinced to make the purchase.  If you are not aware of Geo, he owns shavenation.com.  He has made dozens of reviews on products and while shaving with this razor he used the word &amp;#34;Wow&amp;#34; about 7 times.  I agree, wow is the word.  I like the feel of the lined handle, it&#x27;s a nice grip.  I also like the weight, it&#x27;s heavy but not so heavy as to cause fatigue.  It&#x27;s a three piece, so it takes a little more to load the blade than my dad&#x27;s Gillette TTO that I also use.  The chrome is flawless and makes an amazing presence in the bathroom.  This is a quality product that I plan to leave to one of my sons or grandsons.</li>
    <li> Work of art, very smooth shave.  I&#x27;m still learning (shaved twice so far, three passes each time) the proper angle for this razor so I have a few nicks, no biggie, but the shave is so much better than what I got with the traditional triple-blade cartridge set up.  I&#x27;m not a heavy beard guy, but I do grow a goatee quickly so that area and under my chin are my main problem areas.  I could never get a real close shave with the cartridge razors, but now it&#x27;s BSS (baby smooth skin) shaves ... minus the couple nicks, lol.  Seriously, I&#x27;ll get it down and the nicks will be a thing of the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Visually, as many others have stated, this razor is beautiful.  Super-shiny chrome, no manufacturing marks anywhere, very well polished quality item.  The handle is shorter than the standard razors (modern, cartridge-style), but I find it to be a perfect fit and the weight of this razor is fantastic.  Just enough weight to know you just need to glide the razor across your skin (once you&#x27;ve lathered with a good soap or creme of course), don&#x27;t apply much pressure at all ... that&#x27;s how I got nicked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely an art to using these razors, but one that I expect will be mastered after a few shaves.  I will not go back to conventional razors and am hooked on this style shaving thanks to Edwin Jagger.  Don&#x27;t forget the accessories.  Next most important is the brush.  I bought a package deal from the local store (Van der Hagen Premium Shave Set) which comes with a boar brush.  It seems like a fine enough set and is working, but after reading so many reviews about the badger hair brushes I also bought a Edwin Jagger Silvertip Badger Brush along with a chrome stand that will hold my brush and razor in style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this razor, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Now I&#x27;m getting great shaves again!  I decided on a whim to try going back to double-edged shaving recently, and I am glad I did!  I have used multi-blade cartridges and several types of electric shavers in recent years, and have never been satisfied with the results.  Now I&#x27;m a happy shaver again!  This Edwin Jagger razor is superbly crafted, looks great, and gives me close, long-lasting shaves.  I really like this design in that it is NOT a butterfly opening.  The top blade retainer easily comes completely off to change the blade, which means that it is ONE piece and does not shift around while you shave.  Put in a new blade, replace the top retainer, screw on the handle (which attaches to the retainer through the blade), and shave!</li>
    <li> This razor is not just ABSOLUTELY beautiful, it gives a BABIES BOTTOM shave ( loaded with a Feather of course ) !!!! Don&#x27;t hesitate, just buy !!!!!!!! If you shave everyday and don&#x27;t need something super aggressive, then just buy this razor !!!!! YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED !!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Priced well, solid razor. Buy it</li>
    <li> When I was first trying to decide what razor should be my entry into the world of DE shaving I looked at the Edwin Jagger DE89lbl. Upon receiving it I must say it was solidly made, crafted in England, and of very high quality. I have been using this razor for the last few months and I have not been disappointed. If you give this razor a try with a high quality blade, adequate time to shave and patience you will never go back to cartridge shaving.</li>
    <li> This razor is a work of art.  I was worried that the handle would become too slick when wet, but that is not the case.  My buying decision started with me wanting a Merkur, but then I read a forum post debating between the Merkur and this.  This was chosen 8/10 times, so I decided I&#x27;d try this out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box it comes in is nice, and a sign of quality inside.  The razor breaks down into 3 components, and screws together very solidly.  The blades (I use Astra Platinum) are presented at the perfect angle for me, and I look forward to shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have it on an Edwin Jagger razor stand, and people compliment me on its elegance whenever my guests use the master bath.  I know that sounds a bit odd, but the shave just feels elegant, compared to the rushed cartridge razors...</li>
    <li> There are more in depth reviews out there, but I just wanted to add to the 5 star pool. This is a fine made razor, that is both easy to use and nice to look at.&lt;br /&gt;Overall VERY happy, and haven&#x27;t cut myself yet *knock on wood*.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I feel this can cut closer then some of multiblade cartridges (I&#x27;m coming from a mach III &amp; V). YMMV however.&lt;br /&gt;NOTE2: I don&#x27;t use any special lathers, brushes, aftershave etc. I either shave in the shower, or use a thin layer of shaving gel. My beard is fairly course and haven&#x27;t had a problem. I feel the type of blades are more important than all that. however the brushes etc do look cool sitting on the counter, so I might buy some just for that.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used safety razors for some time now and have enjoyed several (favorites being a Merkur Futur and Gillette Fatboy).  Recently, I received this Edwin Jagger as a gift and went through my usual testing procedure.  I try various soaps (Porasco, Taylor of Old Bond Street, Omega, and  a couple handcrafted soaps), do my usual prep work with pre oil &amp; hot towel, and I get a blade sampler called \\&quot;a great mix\\&quot; off ebay for a broad range of premium blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I found is that this Edwin Jagger is a much more forgiving shave and that blades that are not necessarily considered top-shelf still perform quite well.  Specifically, this Jagger requires a less exacting technique and delivers a very smooth shave.  Cheaper blades like Dorco, Derbys, or Sharks work rather well with the Jagger,  while I don&#x27;t like them at all in my other razors.  This saves money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, you need to be very careful with a feather blade in the most aggressive setting in a Futur (damn near cut my ear off using those-but that&#x27;s another story) but this Jagger \\&quot;tames\\&quot; the sharper blade varieties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my gym bag razor, and the ideal choice for the beginning safety razor novice!</li>
    <li> The chrome is soo bright that i feel like a million bucks when I shave.  It&#x27;s a mild razor and very easy to shave for beginners.  I recommend newbies to buy this safety razor first over the Feather Popular because it&#x27;s easier to learn to shave with.  This razor has some weight to it and you basically just lay it on your face and let the weight of it shave.  With the Feather Popular, it&#x27;s very easy to go against the rule of &amp;#34;no pressure&amp;#34; when shaving because it feels as light as a feather and can easily cause irritation.</li>
    <li> Sometimes I sign my bar tabs \\&quot;Edwin Jagger\\&quot; because I love this razor THAT much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not an expensive razor but it looks nice and handles well. Speaking of handles, the handle is short so make sure you know that before you order. I did because I do my homework, but I don&#x27;t know who YOU are and some people complain about that feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look don&#x27;t go into a sub shop and order a large meatball sub with extra meatballs covered in meatball sauce if you are allergic to meatballs. It&#x27;s that simple. Read up on your purchase before you click \\&quot;order.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, I purchased this razor about a year and half ago and I use it about 2 - 3 times a week. I take care of it and wash and dry it after each use. Toss your blades after each use and never leave the blade in the razor to dry and you should be good to go for a long time.</li>
    <li> After much deliberation and research... okay, too much research, I decided to order the Edwin Jagger De89lbl Chromed razor with lined detail handle.  I could not be any happier than I am with this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fit and finish is superb, and pretty much every review you read mentions this fact, but it is worth mentioning, only because it is as close to a work of art as you will find with regards to how beautiful the craftsmanship is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth noting, the Jagger heads are actually made in a joint effort with Muhle, so if you plan on rolling into the Art of Shaving, and dropping $99 on a Muhle, you might want to check out the $32 variety in this Jagger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first foray into the wet shaving arena was with a Weishi razor, made for the mainstream disguised as the One Touch Micro Razor, and upon side by side inspection it is kind of laughable, as you look at the tooling, and the forging differences, including the comb, and the actual top of the razor itself.  Not even a fair fight, and it makes a huge difference in your shaving experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used two blade varieties so far, Dorko and Derby.  My feathers are ordered but not here yet, and they will come with Bluebirds as well, so i can report back on those later.  So far, for me, the Derby seems to favor my face better, and as with all blades, the preference will have many variables, but no matter which blade you choose, the Jagger is a great choice for a close, comfy shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say moderately more aggressive than the Weishi, but  not so much as to cause much trepidation before a shave.  The key is to prep, prep, prep.  Wash your face with some sort of glycerin-based wash to get the grime and dirt out of your pores, and let the slickness of the glycerin help with the razor&#x27;s glide, and enjoy a great shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As mentioned, this is not the razor for you if you are a minute-man.  If you lather up with Barbasol, and try to break the land-speed record for shaving prior to going to work, don&#x27;t bother with a safety razor.  This is a project meant to take some extra man-time for yourself, and pretty soon, you will learn to build just the right amount of lather with your Semogue Boar-Hair, for a three pass shave.  Once with the grain, once sideways, and the last pass against the grain, for a face as smooth as it was when you were nine years old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are thinking about getting into wet shaving, and want an excuse to jump into a beautifully crafted piece of art, do not hesitate to consider the Jagger De89.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is really that good.&lt;br /&gt;~syf</li>
    <li> Totaly happy With this purchase.Very smooth shave,no cuts,and the finish on it is beautiful.I made a special rack for it like it was a piece of fine jewlery.Very happy with this purchase.I dont believe I&#x27;ll ever use anything but this DE for the rest of my life.:)</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, eczema, allergies and chemical sensitivities so shaving is unpleasant chore.  I have tried mach 3, mach 5, and bic etc.  I always ended up going back to the single blade yellow Bic for sensitive skin.  Which does not give an exceptionally smooth shave.  I have used Norelco and Remington electric razors too both irritated my skin. I was excited to find a single blade that could give me a closer shave.  I did numerous hours or research on the internet on safety razors and brands.  I decided on this edwin jagger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WOW what a quality razor.  Solid built with less blade exposure and easy to shave with.  The cartridges are easy to load.  The angle on the head really is gives you a close shave and is easy to use.  First time through with no nicks or cuts.  I just took my time.  I read many posts about people worrying about cutting themselves with safety razors and what angle to use etc.  STOP before you get engrossed with this.  Just like my title says its a safety razor and this one have less blade exposure than other safety razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say this, I does take a time or two to get the used to shaving with this.  Holding the angle on the chin was a little more work than I was used too. I had to re-shave the chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The replacement blades are really cheap.  I think I can shave all year for 15.00 or less in blade cost. I will post updates as I go for  everyone.  I am also waiting for bic and feather blades with are sharper then the derby blades that come with the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 3/28/2013:&lt;br /&gt;Still using this every day for shaving.  I have built up to a 2 pass shave, with the grain and across the grain.  It gives a smooth close shave on the cheeks and chin.  Not quite as good on the neck part where the hair grows up and not down rated 2nd best for this (gillette mach 5 only razor I have used that gets closer shave in this neck area).  I bought a blade sampler pack and switched to the bic blades.  I found awebsite rating them as the 2nd sharpest blades on the market.  My shaving just got better as the blades cut through clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a few nicks when I got careless but got it totally figured out now.  Shave time is decreasing everyday. I recommend using proraso products for pre-shave, cream and post shave.  I have loved these just as much as the razor.</li>
    <li> Very nice product. Easy to get a comfortable and close shave. Easy to clean. I will never buy the crap being sold in retail stores again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 60 years old.  When I was young and starting out, I used a double edge safety razor, shaving brush and a soap dish.  Somewhere along the line, I succumbed to the plastic razors in a pack and have been using them ever since.  And when I run out, it was the same old thing.  Write down all the names of the ones that took replacement blades, head to the store, and shake my head.  Too expensive.  I&#x27;d end up buying a pack of 4 or 5 throwaways for around $10.00.  Two weeks later, I&#x27;m back in the store.  So I sat down and ordered this Edwin Jagger Safety Razor with Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream and a brush.  What a smooth shave!  I&#x27;ve had the set about 6 weeks and have run through a few blades (10 cents a blade) and I&#x27;m not looking back.  Used one of those throwaway razors on a short trip ( can&#x27;t take blades through security) and the shave was terrible.  Couldn&#x27;t wait to get home.  BTW, the Cream looks hardly used.  Doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
    <li> After having paid my fair share for the Fusions, etc, I decided to go back to the basics and am not regretting my choice a bit! Clean shave, after 2 passes (plus a 3rd to satisfy my OCD), just be patient and do not rush thru the experience. If you do, the razor will let you know ;-) .....enjoy!</li>
    <li> I jump back and forth between this razor and my 1940s Gilette Aristocrat. I must say this razor gives a comfortable, smooth shave and it rivals what the best razors can do. For the price, it is amazing. I would not hesitate to buy this again. The shipping was quick. It arrived in 2 days. With a good brush and set of blades, this razor is absolutely amazing!</li>
    <li> Yesterday I received my new Edwin Jagger DE89lbl from Amazon. I really wanted to like this razor. I am completely new to wet shaving and like most people, did research on the internet before deciding on this one. Delivery was quick as usual. I opened the package to find the black box holding my new razor. I immediately opened the box to find a beautiful chrome shaving tool. Unwrapping the tissue paper and inspecting the razor, I cannot overstate how perfect the chroming on this razor is. I showed it to my wife and she suggested that I have my name engraved across the top plate. How silly is that? (I AM considering it ). It has the finished look of jewelry.  It is very well made, has significant weight and excellent balance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I opened the Derby blade pack and removed a blade, wrapped in paper. Upon unwrapping, I was struck by how thin the blade was...paper thin AND VERY SHARP. I expected it to be..... thicker. I disassembled the razor and installed the blade, carefully holding it by the ends. After reassembling the razor, I checked the for blade positioning in relation to the combs. It appeared to be perfect. As I stand there checking blade position and admiring the construction of this razor, IT HAPPENED. I suddenly became aware that in order to use this torture device, I would have to place that very sharp, very exposed blade against my bare skin. I became VERY apprehensive. I do not have baby smooth skin, nor is it soft and supple. I became worried that I would need an ambulance standing by during my first shave, if I could muster the courage to use it at all.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This morning, weather delayed the start of work by a couple of hours. I had some time to spare so I thought I would use it to try out my new razor. I received my Proroso  green tub soap and Tweezerman  badger brush last week. I have had a week to learn to build lather and apply it effectively. So off I went, cell phone in hand, should emergency medical personnel be needed quickly. After building a smooth creamy lather in my bowl, applying Noxema to the area to be shaved, and  thoroughly covering my chin with lather, I was ready. With shaky hands, I picked up my Edwin Jagger DE89lbl and laid it gently against my face. Holding back my tears, I let gravity pull the razor toward the Earth as I attempted to maintain the correct angle of the handle. The gentle scraping sound of the razor cutting the hairs on my face reassured me I was doing it at least partially correct.  As I looked in the mirror, i could see a clean strip of skin where shaving cream had once been. I looked for signs of incisions, abrasions, inflammation, irritation, aggravation OR BLOOD. Nothing. Nada. Zip. I had done it. I proceded to shave my entire face with the grain. Not a nick. I relathered and shaved against the grain...Again not a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking back, I was kinda not manly worrying about removing layers of skin on my face. But it turns out, my fears were completely unfounded. Even with less than perfect skin, this razor and this blade gave me a smooth clean shave with little to no irritation and no nicks or cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I said I really wanted to like this razor.... I DO LIKE IT.  I also like the Proraso green soap and the Tweezerman brush. Like I said, I am completely new to DE shaving. But this razor is a good choice for me and it will be a good choice most new DE shavers. Great price, fantastic quality and very easy to use, even for a total beginner.... even if it scares you a little at first.</li>
    <li> After owning this razor for 10 months, here are my conclusions.  I still use my Edwin Jagger DE razor every day.  When I first got it, there was a learning curve of about a month.  I was cutting up my face quite a bit at first before I got the hang of it, but it was worth it.  Every time I shave with it, I shave down one time, sideways one time and up to finish off (with the exception of my neck with I only shave down twice on to eliminate irritation).  I started off using the Parker Safety Razor 100% Black Badger Bristle Shaving Brush along with the Derby DE razor blades and Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream.  This worked well, but took more time when you considered that you have to clean the brush every time you use it.  I have since switched to using Nivea for Men Q10 Energy Shaving Gel which is the best shaving cream I have ever used and does just as good a job without the brush.  If you haven&#x27;t used this shaving cream, give it a try.  It gives you a nice, thick lather and has a neutral smell--great stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the Edwin Jagger gives me a very close shave, there are some issues.  It is tough to get a really close shave directly under the chin (not as close as with Mach 3), on the adam&#x27;s apple area (easy to cut yourself) and on the top of the beard just below the nose (leaves just a pinch of stubble that is just hard to get with this razor).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A big reason I switched to a DE razor was to save on the ridiculous cost of the Gillette Mach 3 blades.  The Derby DE blades are 7.5 cents each and the Mach 3 blades range from $1.38 (the best I&#x27;ve found) to the $2.50 range per blade.  I used to get roughly 1 1/2 to 2 weeks out of the Mach 3 blades when I was just shaving downwards only one time.  I get 3 full shaves (shaving 3 different directions) out of each Derby blade and I could get four, but what&#x27;s the point in pushing it with dull blades at all when they are 7.5 cents each?  They stay sharp for three shaves shaving three directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coming back to the problems above with the Edwin Jagger DE razor, I still use my Mach 3 for getting the stubble directly under my nose, directly under the chin (shaving up) and on my adam&#x27;s apple area (no more cuts).  Since I have been doing this, I have totally avoided cuts and get a perfect shave.  And by the way, I have tried all of the tricks to using DE blades that I found on youtube videos.  I still think the Mach 3 is better for certain things.  I would say that now my Mach 3 blades last 3-4 weeks per blade, so I&#x27;m still saving a lot and I&#x27;m getting a much better shave then when I was previously shaving down only with the Mach 3.  I do believe that razors and blades have improved over the years since Gillette has taken over, but the positives improvements don&#x27;t justify the insanely higher cost of the blades.  By using the Mach 3 with the Edwin Jagger DE razor, I get the benefits of the newer technology (which means less cuts and a better shave on the curves of the face) while still saving a ton on my blades since they last longer.  Also, I end up with a far superior shave since I am making 3 passes over my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In case you are wondering, I have an average beard with dark stubble.  When I used to to just shave down with my Mach 3, I had a nice 5 o&#x27;clock shadow at the end of the day.  The way I am doing it now, I would say my shave lasts at least twice as long as it used to and I no longer have a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow at the end of the day.  One last thing.  Try out Bump Patrol aftershave treatment if you have any issues with those annoying red bumps on your neck.  The stuff works wonders.</li>
    <li> This is the best shave i have had in years.  Currently using the yeti Morning wood with it and Astra Blades.  BBS every morning and my acne is all gone.  For the first time in 20 years.</li>
    <li> bought it for my boy friend for x mas and his skin is STILL smooth as ever from this product.</li>
    <li> To echo the comments of other reviewers, the EJDe89 is a gorgeous razor that&#x27;s perfect for new and experienced shavers.  I&#x27;ve had almost no nicks, cuts, or abrasions since I began using it earlier this month, and shaving is now a luxurious experience rather than a rushed necessity.  That said, Amazon&#x27;s pricing is horrible. It fluctuates almost daily, and they will not honor a reduction subsequent to your order unless it&#x27;s within seven days.  I paid $43 for this razor on March 4, and yesterday it was $33.56.  $10 may not sound like much, but it&#x27;s a ~25% difference.  My advice to would-be classic shavers is read the reviews here, but buy the razor elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Beautiful, heavy chrome razor. Used for first time this morning. Quite different from the U.S.-made Regus, which is minimalist in design. The Edwin Jagger is heavy and formidable with a long (in comparison to the Regus) handle. It wouldn&#x27;t look out of place in a technology museum but also offers a good shaving experience. It quickly pays for itself in the switch from disposable shaving razors.</li>
    <li> This is my first safety razor and have no complaints. Tip: Watch some youtube videos or read some forums prior to shaving for the first time. It is an art.</li>
    <li> Amazing. if your new to wet shaving/DE razors grab this guy.  I&#x27;m simply in love, great shave, heavy but balanced, tastes good</li>
    <li> good quality. love it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Mach 3&#x27;s pretty much since I started shaving up until about 6 years ago when I got a really \\&quot;good\\&quot; electric foil shaver (sick of replacing Mach 3 blades). I have sensitive skin and both always tore my neck up, so I shaved whenever necessary, otherwise once a week or so. Anyways, the girlfriend and I went to Jamaica about 2 years ago and I didn&#x27;t want to deal with taking the electric since it had a charging/cleaning base (with liquid) that I&#x27;d need before the trip ended. I found some \\&quot;old\\&quot; new Mach 3 blades in the back of my bathroom closet, the handle, and packed them up. Using it for the first time in years, I realized it was a much better shave than I convinced myself that the electric was... but I still didn&#x27;t want to deal with frequently purchasing expensive, landfill filling cartridges. When we got back, I looked for a deal on Amazon multipacks for a bulk discount and instead came across double edge blade reviews. Wet shaving was new to me, so I did some more research. I ended up asking for an EJ DE89L for Christmas thinking if someone got it for me, I could try it out for no loss. Well, I got it... and I&#x27;m never looking back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t all roses immediately (there&#x27;s a subtle pun in there)... I had to learn good technique (only 2 cuts of any concern along the way), try multiple blade brands, creams... you know the drill. After finding what worked for me and what I liked however, I&#x27;d have to say I actually LOVE shaving now. If not every day, I&#x27;ll shave every other day. The hair comes off like butter with little to no red bumps on my once ravaged neck! I also have quite a bit of brands/scents of soaps, creams, an alum block, pre-shave oils, balms, skin foods, etc., that I like to switch up just because I&#x27;ve become a shave nerd! The girlfriend loves the rose and avocado creams in particular, as do I.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Specific and back to the Jagger, I&#x27;ve since purchased a Parker 99r, being intrigued with the butterfly opening head for another option. I don&#x27;t like it nearly as much... that&#x27;s actually the one I cut myself with twice. It&#x27;s longer and I find my palm starts unscrewing the handle, allowing the blade to become loose. This all depends on how you hold your razor, so YMMV. I&#x27;m awaiting a Merkur Futur for my birthday, so I may follow up if I find that razor to be significantly better or worse for me. Until then, thank you Edwin Jagger! Finally, since a lot of people might want to know this (as did I)... I considered the renowned Merkur 34C HD while choosing the Jagger as both seemed very similar. The Jagger looks a little better to me so I rooted on the underdog and do not regret it. Like another reviewer said, if it doesn&#x27;t work out for you, there&#x27;s a good market for used razors and you can try a different one..

    <li> just a darn good razor and a good buy</li>
    <li> Every review that I read mentioned that there is a learning curve and that you need to find the right blade brand in order to get a really nice and close shave but I haven&#x27;t had any of those problems.  The first time I used it was the closest shave that I have ever gotten before, I would recommend this brand but also just any type of safety razor for that matter.  Shave on brothers.  Cheers.</li>
    <li> One of the best safety razors I&#x27;ve purchased. Went with this after my 70 year old Gillette Tech snapped, and haven&#x27;t been disappointed. It&#x27;s sturdy, well built, and balanced very well. It also has a decent amount of weight, making it easy to control. The blade position from the comb is exactly how I like it, so I very rarely nick myself. Definitely a worthwhile investment.</li>
    <li> I bought for my husband 2 types of razors: Edwin and Merkur 180 for his choice and decision. without doubts, Edwin was winner .&lt;br /&gt;small addition information for your consideration: you have NOT return your Edwin Razor in case that you will wаnt to.</li>
    <li> Old school razor... great quality and a good shave. Really people.... Gillette blades are good... but the cost of these old fashioned blades will make you question why you are paying so much to sponsor sports stars....  give these a go.... Very pleased I did :)</li>
    <li> I have always hated mornings. There are lots of reasons for that, but shaving was definitely a big part of the problem. I&#x27;ve been using my Edwin Jagger Double Edge razor for a while now, and I actually look forward to shaving for the first time in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor glows with quality: the chrome plating is rich and deep, the pieces fit together smoothly, and it feels solid. I also have to travel regularly, and even bouncing around in my dopp kit it hasn&#x27;t shown any damage or wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a few other pieces of my shaving kit that I would recommend you try out, and all are available from Amazon:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving cream (lathers well and makes skin feel great all day)&lt;br /&gt;Feather blades (I&#x27;ve been experimenting with blades, and these seem to work best, at least for me)&lt;br /&gt;Tweezerman Badger Shaving Brush (inexpensive but much smoother feel than other options, also holding up well to regular use)</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t think twice this was my first safety razor and I finally don&#x27;t have irritation on my neck . Pair this with some feather blades a good brush a good oil and a good lather you won&#x27;t be dissapointed. Not to mention it&#x27;ll last a life time considering I have a Gillette from 1930 haha</li>
    <li> this works great especially with the blades that are supplied with it.  of course, it takes a little time to get used to shaving with this style of razor but once one is used to it, what a smooth shave.  No burn and have finally stopped nicking myself.</li>
    <li> I spent a lot of time researching DE razors and it came down to two choices, the Murkur 34c or this one. I can tell you I am not disappointed with this razor at all. That doesn&#x27;t mean that the Murker is a bad razor, it is just the one I didn&#x27;t pick.  Being new to safety razors, I didn&#x27;t know what to expect, but the razor feels great in my hand, and does not slip even with a wet hand. It is a little heavier than I expected but that is fine.I just have to be conscious of  how much pressure I am applying while shaving. (no pressure!) It has a beautiful polished chrome finish; it looks wonderful in my shave den. If this is your first DE razor I highly recommend doing some research on how to properly use the razor.</li>
    <li> Great razor Edwin Jagger is the best and i would recommend to any novice or experienced shaver!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have several Merkur&#x27;s and some old school Gillette Fatboy&#x27;s.  Out of the modern lot, this one is my favorite.  This has a really longer handle than most, very nicely chrome plated, and very solidly made.  You can tell the chrome plating is very generously applied. Heavy duty.  Love it.</li>
    <li> This razor is awesome! I&#x27;ve used the included blades and the feather brand as well. My skin is sensitive to nicks and cuts; I normally used a Panasonic electric shaver for everyday shaving, but when I want to grow some beard and style it I use this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;If you follow the instructions: wash your face with hot water and soap, apply a layer of foam and shave it at a low enough angle there&#x27;s basically no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;Really good shaver, worth trying it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor as my main razor for quite a while. I&#x27;ve had no problems with it at all. I get a close, smooth shave consistently. I&#x27;ve found that shaving gels in tubes and shaving soaps give me the best shave with this. I no longer use any thing from a can and creams don&#x27;t provide the coating I like that help this razor glide across my face. It&#x27;s well built and fairly hefty. The handle is a little shorter than the rest of my safety razors, but the balance is still good.&lt;br /&gt;The reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that my brother in law was visiting and I lent it to him to use only one time. When he returned it the handle was dented in two places. I assume it was from tapping against the sink edge as you would do with a disposable razor. He obviously wasn&#x27;t as careful with it as I was. Either way I don&#x27;t think the handle should have dented so I assume that it is not as solid as I would have thought. The handle must be sort of hollow in order to get dented as it is.</li>
    <li> This razor is a piece of art!  The quality of this is amazing, the craftsmanship is bar none. The biggest thing with this is the angle of the blade, and the ease of changes.  Works better than a butterfly razor, easy to change.  This is the one I will be using for the next 20 years and pass on to my sons.</li>
    <li> This was my very first safety razor, i had never used one before and wasn&#x27;t sure quite what to expect. I was coming from Gillette cartridge crap.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this razor along with a brush, proraso soap, and also a 20 pack of FEATHER Hi-Stainless blades.&lt;br /&gt;First shave was, well, a learning experience, Took 1 hour. I of course started with the DERBY blades that were included, and i was very disappointed with how it went. It was very irritating, felt like dragging a kitchen knife along my face.&lt;br /&gt;After the poor first pass i switched to a Feather blade, that was the best thing I&#x27;d ever done. There was NO irritation from the feather, they are so sharp that they cut without pulling the hair at all. Deby is a butter knife as Feather is a ninja&#x27;s sword.&lt;br /&gt;If you have super soft hair these Derbys might work for you, but I am very happy i added those Feathers to my order, or i would have been finishing up with my old crapy gillette that day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, overall i love this Razor. Edwin Jagger is great quality.</li>
    <li> What an elegant looking razor. it has a nice amount of weight to it. Hassle free changing blades &amp; easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Use with caution,  these types of blades are amazingly sharp.  Handle balance is nice.</li>
    <li> This razor is far better when changing blades since the handle unscrews from the head allowing you to separate the 2 pieces of the head unit to change blades.  This handle is also heavier than soe of the others I&#x27;ve used, and I like the weight &amp; feel!</li>
    <li> After doing a lot of online research I bought this double edge handle and for me, it was the most comfortable shave of all the double edge handles that I tried.  Its also extremely important that you get a very good shave creme and a superior brush and blade.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this purchase.  I use it daily.  I have tried a couple of different safety razors &amp; I still like this one best.  Great grip even when wet.  Excellent weight &amp; size.</li>
    <li> Worked well...until I dropped it on the bath mat. The threaded post, which attaches the razor to the handle sheared off, rendering the razor useless. My fault, but this is clearly low quality metal. Handle very carefully if you purchase.</li>
    <li> I spent the last year using cheap safety razor that was made in China. This was by choice. I wanted to try shaving with a safety razor on the cheap before going all in. The cheap razor did a fair job. It convinced me that shaving with a safety razor, even a cheap one is better than all the multi blade razors and a whole lot cheaper. I&#x27;ve now shaved with the Edwin for 3 days and overall I&#x27;m pleased. The Edwin Jagger although only a paltry 35 dollars is an outstanding razor. Heads and shoulders above the cheap safety razor made in China. The first thing I noticed when comparing the Edwin to my China razor was the weight. The Edwin is much heavier although well balanced. Next was how the blade fit. The China made razor I have is a twist to open clamshell type. And the blade never fit perfectly. From end to end the same amount of blade should be exposed. Not the case with the cheaper razor. With the Edwin it&#x27;s perfect from side to side. Exactly the same amount of blade is exposed from end to end. The chroming is very nice. The razor is easy to take  a part. The instructions suggest taking the razor a part and drying after each shave. Although another step to add to my morning routine it&#x27;s not that big a deal. And if it will extend the life of the razor it&#x27;s all good. The only thing at all negative if I could find one is the length of the handle. It&#x27;s somewhat short compared to my cheap razor. On the other hand perhaps I&#x27;ve just adapted to the longer handle after using it for the past year. I&#x27;m sure I will adjust to the shorter handle.</li>
    <li> Awesome razor. It is well balanced and looks great. I&#x27;m new to wet shaving and really  shaving know general. Despite my lack of experience, this razor coupled with the Derby blades gave a great shave with very little cutting.</li>
    <li> This English razor is very well made , nice balance and appropriate weight. The only thing left is to see how long it last. The two previous DBs I purchased ( other brands ) broke within 1 year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades that come with the razor are crap . I would use either Feather or Merkosur blades. The first being Japanese hi-stainless and the second German.&lt;br /&gt; The combination of this razor , Feather blades and Cremo shave cream is the best &amp; smoothest shave I have ever experienced. I have been shaving for about 50 years now.</li>
    <li> I am 68 and obviously been shaving for a long time. As a young man i used a safety razor and always came away with nicks and scrapes. I do not know why I thought this type of razor would be any better given my experience. Even using the razor cautiously, taking my time to prepare for the shave I still had the same experience as when younger. That&#x27;s probably why I switched to the new generation of razors. If I have two days growth, I use my electric razor the remove excessive growth and then finish with my Gillette Fusion. I get an excellent shave without any irritation. This method also works for Schick razors. I suppose that men who have never used a safety razor will be tempted to experiment, but I think that the vast majority will suffer the same outcome as I did. The razor is of high quality and beautiful to look at. Good luck, I am buying stock in Band-aid.</li>
    <li> Been using this razor for 6 months now and it&#x27;s fantastic.  perfect shape and feel.  Nothing bad to say about it</li>
    <li> I had this razor for 6 months before it committed suicide on my shower floor. A plastic shower stall floor and a four foot drop did it in. Read the other one star reviews describing the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor is very nice looking, and works well, but that&#x27;s all cancelled out by its dismal durability. The core is cheap, brittle, cast metal. (pot metal) the same junk the Chinese love to cast their crap from. It will NOT survive a fall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you buy one, be prepared to pretend you&#x27;re shaving with nitro-glycerin and don&#x27;t drop it, from even 1 foot, or you&#x27;ll be out $40, and Edwin Jagger will not send you any parts without shelling out more money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is completely smooth. You WILL get shaving cream or gel on your hands. You WILL drop it. It WILL break. It will NOT last a lifetime, (unless you have no more than 3-6 months left to live.)</li>
    <li> I liked this razor as soon as I saw it and held it in my hand. It has a great feel and the finish is solid and should last a very long time. I usually like a butterfly open razor, but this Edwin Jagger has changed my mind. I&#x27;m a little crazy about keeping my razor clean, and this three piece model makes it very eday to clean and I mean clean off all of the soap residue. My other double edge razor is a Parker which is fine but doesn&#x27;t have a great feel of quality craftsmanship like the EJ.</li>
    <li> My first DE razor. Looks great, has a good weight to it and functions perfectly. No complaints here.</li>
    <li> Just switched from disposables.  After a couple weeks, I&#x27;m sold.  It took a little while to get the angle right and the trick seems to be using very short strokes.  I was concerned the handle would be too short but it&#x27;s perfect the way it is.  However, I may end up looking for a different razor with &amp;#34;ambulance door&amp;#34; blade loading as dismantling the device to load each morning is just slightly annoying.</li>
    <li> Used to shave with a short handle razor with a thinner handle. Love the way this substantial razor handle feels in the hand, and I am getting a nice close shave with the included Derby blades. No regrets.</li>
    <li> This is my first single blade razor so I do not have much to compare it to as it relates to others safety razors. However I can tell you this a much better shaving experience than using s multiblade razor. The single blade let&#x27;s you shave thats best for you and not just the angle the marketing team selected. It takes a little longer to shave but your face can tell the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy a blade variety pack to find the best blade for you, the blades that come with it are some of the cheapest on the market and behave like it.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best razor I have owned. Going from overpriced disposable heads to this was a great choice</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this razor.  I&#x27;ve used other straight razors before, however, the prep work that is required to get your beard ready almost makes the closeness of a straight razor shave not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I got this one because I lost the other, thinking it would be the same quality shave.  Much to my great surprise, this razor was phenomenal.  Very close shave and after a few times of not a single nick, I thought I&#x27;d adjust my pre-shave regimen slightly.  Not a single nick.  So glad I lost the other razor and found this one.</li>
    <li> exceed my expectations</li>
    <li> this was my first safety razor and I will never shave with a cartridge razor again. I have not tried any other safety razor but I really don&#x27;t see a need, this one works great.</li>
    <li> Quality of Razor:  So I got this razor three weeks ago as my first DE shaving razor.  My initial impression was that the razor looks like and is a fine tool.  It has a good weight to it, being solid metal and the balance is good as well.  Many people have commented on the chrome finish, and it is very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Difficulty of use:  I can&#x27;t compare this to any other DE razors as this is the only one I have but I will say that the learning curve coming from a disposable razor is very easy.  I have a very thick beard and was expecting to cut myself a few times learning the ropes on this razor.  However, I have only nicked myself 3 times in about 20 shaves, and these were all when I got into a hurry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality of Shave:  Every razor review I read all talked about how much better the DE shaving experience was.  I was a little skeptical, and the main reason I was switching was due to the fact that Mach 3 blades now cost two bucks apiece, and I am cheap.  I wanted to wait to review this razor until I was sure that the extra 2-5 minutes it takes to shave was worth the cost savings, and I have to say it is.  I was expecting no better a shave than I had been getting, but that expectation has been completely blown away.  I keep making my wife feel my face because it is so smooth.  I actually look forward to shaving now, whereas I hated it before.</li>
    <li> This razor is smooth, feels good in my hands, handles really good by far my favorite razor.Its a good razor</li>
    <li> I really like this razor!  I&#x27;ve also used multiple classic Gillette double edge safety razors and I keep coming back to this product.  It is sharp looking and provides a great shave.</li>
    <li> What can i say that has not been said, don&#x27;t worry just buy it. One of the best shaves i have ever had and the thing looks good too.</li>
    <li> Razor very well made. Very comfortable shave. High quality product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chrome is near perfect. Blade gap consistent from side to side on front and back. Razor is a perfect weight and well ballanced.</li>
    <li> Wow!  great feel in hand.  Love the textured lines in the barrel.  Easy to change blades and cleaning is easy to do too!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the finish and look of this razor. Only time will tell if the finish holds, but it holds the blade securely.</li>
    <li> Finally! This thing changed my life. I&#x27;ve been using plastic disposables forever. I hated them. I loathed shaving, I despised paying so much for new cartridges in the store, only to find them dull a week or two later. The rashes on my neck, the razor burn, the bumps and pimples. I wanted to be done with it forever. In my desperation I sought another way. I learned of something called wet shaving and how those who practice it experience irritation-free shaving with healthier skin. So I jumped. I purchased this razor, a badger hair brush, Tabac shaving soap (highly recommended), and a new aftershave. It took a while, but after learning how to properly use this thing I switched the default Derby blades to Feathers and I&#x27;ve been having the smoothest and most comfortable shaves in my entire life. Why I ever wasted so much time on store bought plastic razors... I never even thought it was possible, but my neck is now blemish free. I&#x27;m happier and more confident for it, and plus I don&#x27;t hate the ritual of shaving now. It&#x27;s become enjoyable - feeling the warm lather on my face is relaxing, and there is just something about using a metal tool like this that inspires manliness. If you&#x27;re thinking about it - do it. It could be one of the best decisions you&#x27;ve ever made.</li>
    <li> It seems so rare to find something that just exemplifies the quality of a well built product.  This is a simple thing, i.e. a safety razor, but every day I use it I am impressed with the quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made the switch from disposable razors to this because I was tired of the high cost of the disposable razors.  Honestly, I think the Mach 3 and Mach 3 Turbo razors are very good, and it is faster to use those, but the cost is ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the Astra blades with mine, and I get a good shave.  As said, it takes me a bit longer to shave with this.  There is a bit of an art to it, but it doesn&#x27;t take long to get it.  Mainly, you have to let the weight of the razor do the job.  When I start rushing and pull it like a disposable razor, I end up with razor burn, or small cuts.  Also, sometimes I use my electric razor to clean up.  I have a small mole, just under, and to the right of my nose.  For obvious reasons, I don&#x27;t use the safety razor on that, so I end up using my electric razor for that anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do get this razor, and I encourage you to, make sure you get the Proraso shaving soap.  That  stuff is great, and it smells really nice.  I actually look forward to shaving each morning, and I only skip, sometimes, on the weekend.</li>
    <li> This is an outstanding product.  Aside from it&#x27;s obviously beautiful construction is its flawless function.  I&#x27;m actually enjoying shaving now.  Blade changes are easy, and the perfect fit means perfect blade alignment everytime.  This this is heirloom quality and should last a lifetime.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent razor. Well designed and loved. After my initial cost of buying this unit, blades and shaving cream I can see many clean shaves in my future. There is no doubt shaving is much more enjoyable and cost effective. Double edge blades are much less expensive and being able to clean the blade gives you a fresh shave every time for multiple times. This decision was a winner!</li>
    <li> A great little razor.  I still consider myself a newby to DE shaving and celebrate this new ritual everyday.  Having been thoroughly bitten by the bug, this is my fourth razor.  And for some reason I&#x27;m hoping it becomes my favorite.  I own a Parker butterfly, two Merkur three piece head razors, and just acquired this Edwin Jagger.  First off, I definitely prefer the three piece head to the butterfly.  The butterfly was my first DE and the shave I got was the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had!!!!!!  Then trying the Merkur three piece heads I found that I still got the same great shave with much less aggressive razors.  The Edwin Jagger is comparable to my Merkurs as far as aggressiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only concern about this razor, even before ordering, was that the handle would be slippery when wet.  My other razors have textured handles. Not a problem!  This razor is not slippery at all, even when the handle is wet!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like best about this razor is the feel in my hand.  It has weight, and it is a very balanced weight.  It is a work of art that gives a great shave.  I really like all my razors, but as I said earlier, the Edwin Jagger is on its way to becoming my favorite.</li>
    <li> This is my first double edge or safety razor of any kind.  I will not go back to disposable cartridge style shaving at any time in the forseeable future.  This is a great shave, takes nominally more time, but is a closer shave, and I feel like a bad ass when I;m done.  Probably because I;m using a &amp;#34;lost art&amp;#34; and shaving like I my grandpa, and great-grandpa did.  After my research, this is one of the better picks for an all around great quality razor, and it is fantastic. Quality piece!</li>
    <li> This Razor is of High Quality.  I am able to shave and enjoy a full Day without any stubble, as my electric razor would leave mid morning.  The Razor is solid, you know it is in your had when your holding it.  It is an attractive Razor as well which left out may attract some attention when you have guests over.</li>
    <li> Exceptionally comfortable but needs a delicate hand or it will cut you more than my grandfather&#x27;s old Gillette, but then it seems to cut closer too.  The only reason it is 4 stars is that the chrome plating seems a little soft; I baby it and it already has a small mark on the top.  Still, I liked it enough I bought two more for my boys when they are old enough to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Been using it for nearly a year now and it is my go to razor.  It took a little while to get the angle figured out but now I can shave cleaner and quicker than I ever did with the old Mach 3.</li>
    <li> Reading the reviews decided me on this razor.  It came quickly and the quality in appearance alone was surprising. After shaving with this I am resold. I felt no irritation which I did with the 5 blade w/soap strip razor I was using. So glad I returned to the style shaving I started with. Very happy with this.</li>
    <li> This razor is very well made.  However, it is not a good match for me.  I used it daily for a month before buying a Merkur with which I am much happier .  With the EJ, I tried various combinations of lubricant (shaving soap, shaving gel, and shaving cream) and 4 different blades (Derby, Merkur, Feather and Wilkinson Sword).  The Feather works best for me along with shaving cream.  I have to make numerous passes with the razor to achieve a close shave.  And I almost always cut myself with the EJ or am left with a painful razor burn that I treat with skin cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Merkur gave me a comfortable shave from the start.  I rarely cut myself with it or get razor burn.  The manufacturing tolerances are not as tight.  The EJ locks the blade in a fixed position.  The Merkur has a significant amount of play that allows the blade to be out of alignment so you have to be careful to position the blade before tightening the handle.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it&#x27;s so highly spoken of, both here and elsewhere. I had previously purchased a Merkur 180, and thought this would be an upgrade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say, on balance, it&#x27;s on a par with the Merkur, though frankly I like the Merkur handle better. The shaves are, for me, roughly comparable and both quite good. The Merkur is, however, a little spartan. Functional like the German tool that it is. The EJ is certainly more stylish, elegant, but I&#x27;m not crazy about it, but you might be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the other end of the elegance scale, you might check out the Lord L6. Kind of like the original Volkswagen, not elegant but gets the job done. [[ASIN:B004N77JVY Lord Premium Safety Razor Model LP1822L aka L6]] I get wonderful shaves from the Lord, better than the EJ at a fraction of the price, though I&#x27;ll still have my EJ in 10 or 20 years, while due to the less substantial construction, I&#x27;ll probably be on my 5th or 6th Lord.</li>
    <li> I will never be using a disposable or replacement head razor ever again.  This product has changed my shaving life forever.</li>
    <li> If you are interested in embarking on the incredible journey of classic shaving, I would say this is a great place to start. This razor is not exactly on the aggressive side; however, that may be the best part about it! Myself personally I seem to prefer more of an aggressive razor, although the DE89 seems to almost be the best of both worlds. I have used the DE89 for well over a year now, and have had nothing but a great experience! Edwin Jagger has to have some of the best customer service I have ever experienced. I experienced issues where the handle began to corrode or chip at the top, which to be honest may have been completely my fault as I was new to this form of shaving and did not properly understand how to care for the razor. Anyways, I reached out to Edwin Jagger with my issue and got a response within just a few business days requesting my information to send me a new one. Not only did they send me an all new razor, they did not request the old one I had ruined. All of this was done in just a matter of about 5 days, great product and a great company!</li>
    <li> Great shave.  I  use to use a Gillette fat boy 40 years ago, I had some relearning to do.  If you are starting out hold the end of the handle with your fingers to avoid putting to much pressure on the blade.  Will save on the nicks.  Shaver is nice weight, gives a good shave (I am excited to shave each morning), shaver looks great</li>
    <li> Make the switch from disposables and never look back</li>
    <li> FANTASTIC! It drastically reduced the amount of money I spend on shaving. It&#x27;s also more comfortable. This is nicely chromed and heavy. Well balanced I didn&#x27;t have to put any force on it. Has lasted without apparent wear or tear for two years.</li>
    <li> One sweet razor. I prefer its weight to that of lighter safety razors, but this should be evaluated by those who are considering a switch from multi-edge cartridge razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a Zen to shaving with a mug, brush, and DE or straight razor. If you&#x27;re a splash and dash sort who shaves before you run off to your corporate cubicle, this is not your best shaving option. If, however, you can be more relaxed, more thorough, and want a great shave, this is as nice as any razor that I have ever used. I like its length, which is just enough greater than Merkur 34C, to be noticeable to one with large hands. The chrome is deep, making the razor aesthetically pleasing if that is important to the buyer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember that your choice of blade is likely as critical as your choice of razor. This is not the place to get cheap; you will already be saving considerably over the purchase of cartridges. This razor comes with five Derby blades, and that is a good start. I would suggest, though, that a sampler of blades is a good idea, as you might find something that you really prefer, thus making your purchase of the Edwin Jagger DE89lbl perfect. I love mine.</li>
    <li> I have two Edwin Jagger razors and they are reasonably priced and expertly crafted works of art that shave very well.  I highly recommend them if you want to get into wet shaving, which is becoming more popular again.</li>
    <li> The handle is GREAT after you clean out the filings in the threads , I was lucky that I read other reviews and was prepared&lt;br /&gt;for the metal chips , I cleaned them out and the handle is wonderful ...</li>
    <li> Switched from multi blade razor (name brand) and really happy. Wish the handle was just a little longer but my fault for not purchasing a longer one. Durable, stylish, and effective. Derby blades it comes with are not the sharpest but you can purchase ones that are for a fraction of the cost of multi blade. Shaving takes a few minutes extra but very close without feeling like I took off 5 layers of skin. Overall very happy.</li>
    <li> Great razor, great shave, great balance, great price. Muhle and Jagger closed comb heads are the same.</li>
    <li> Best razor I have had. Easy clean up and I save around 175 a year from my old disposable ones.</li>
    <li> A fine razor.  It gives me consistently close shaves.  There is no reason to go back to the triple blades safety razor.</li>
    <li> Just getting back into shaving with a safety razor and am very happy with this Edwin Jagger.  The quality of the razor is excellent as is the workmanship and materials.  It is very easy to shave with; a pleasure to use.  The razor came with a 5 pack of Derby blades.  They work well for my beard.</li>
    <li> Very sturdily constructed. First time using a safety razor and I am definitely satisfied with the weight in hand and it&#x27;s ability to give me a good shave without irritating my skin.</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant at first, but after doing a lot of research and considering other products by Merkur and Parker, I went with this Edwin Jagger.  In all my research, I don&#x27;t think I heard one negative about EJ razors.  Got this one on sale for around 34 bucks at Amazon.  The first time shaving with it I cut myself up pretty good in many spots but I was pressing down a lot (I&#x27;m used to a Mach 3 and Fusion).  I&#x27;ve gotten better over the past few weeks and hardly cut myself at all now.  The blades that come with this last me about 6-8 shaves per blade.  I shave with the grain first, then re-lather and shave against the grain and even side ways sometimes... whatever it takes to get my face smooth.  This takes me a few extra minutes to shave with but I don&#x27;t mind... it feels kinda nostalgic in a way.  This razor costs a little more up front than a Mach 3 or Fusion, but in the long run you&#x27;ll save tons of money because the replacement blades are so inexpensive in comparison to Gillette and Schick blades.  Overall, I really like this razor... if you&#x27;re on the fence, get it!!  It&#x27;s excellent quality and the results are very pleasing.  After talking to a few of my friends, they&#x27;re also going to get one as well.  They could not believe how much less the replacement blades for these cost after they&#x27;ve been shelling out dozens more dollars each time buying replacement blades for their Gillette or Schick razors.</li>
    <li> After much research I decided to purchase this razor, it does not look like much but this razor is one of the best things I have ever purchased. It has good weight to it, not to aggressive with its cutting, has very good balance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would defiantly recommend this razor to anyone who is thinking about or already has made the transition from expensive cartridge razors to the wonderful world of classic wet shaving.</li>
    <li> Handle is too short for my taste.</li>
    <li> I have no idea how exactly I came upon this whole DE razor wet shaving business, but it started with insomnia at about 5am, shopping on Amazon because I had nothing better to do.  And I am happy beyond belief that I did, because this is perhaps the most life-changing thing I&#x27;ve done the past year, switching to DE shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is amazing!  I&#x27;ve never had a smoother, closer, nicer shave than this before.  I rarely ever nick myself, even with Feather blades.  And the irritation on my neck I&#x27;d normally get from my ridiculously expensive Mach 5 Pro Fusion vibrating 5-blade jet pack speedboat macguyver gizmo is a non-issue when using this.  And if I&#x27;d ever think about shaving against or across the grain with one of those gadgets, I&#x27;d get all sorts of painful ingrown hairs.  Not so with this guy!  I&#x27;m saving oodles of money and getting the best shave with some of the best scented shaving soaps ever, and I&#x27;m having fun while doing it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes, the chrome finish is gorgeous.  Best purchase of 2012!</li>
    <li> I have now been using this Edwin Jagger DE89 safety razor for nearly two years, and it remains completely flawless in appearance and delivery of the ultimately smooth and comfortable shave.  While any shave is literally \\&quot;at the hand\\&quot; of the shaver, the instrument one uses does have a tremendous impact on how well that shave is executed, and, enjoyed.  To making daily shaving more of a pleasant experience, and not a routine chore, I highly suggest an excellent DE razor like this Edwin Jagger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have reviewed, its craftsmanship is superb, the price is right (especially because it may well be the last and only razor you ever need to purchase), and the feel and ease of shave is remarkable.  Insert a good quality blade (individual preferences vary, but I use a Feather --- very sharp), put on a high quality pre shave oil, lather up a good shaving soap or cream with a decent badger brush...apply and shave.  It becomes a wonderful daily experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your skin will not be \\&quot;pulled along\\&quot; or \\&quot;scratched\\&quot; and irritated as with cartridge blades or cheap disposables --- neither of which will impart the shave you will receive from this Edwin Jagger DE.  And, if you are cost conscience, the overall cost of good double edge blades when compared to cartridge blades, is amazingly lower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Invest in a decent razor like this Edwin Jagger.  You will not be sorry.  (Take care if you are a first time DE blade and razor or wet shaver...it does take a little getting used to, and perhaps a nick or two will be necessary for you to learn your individual personal technique).</li>
    <li> Switched from a plastic older DE to this. WOW! Craftsmanship is top notch, it&#x27;s beautiful as well. Shave is better than the look of it!</li>
    <li> I had moved from an electric to a Mach 5 a few years ago due to skin irritation.  The Mach 5 was better, but was still having trouble - more so now that I wear ties and my appearance is more important.  I understood that a safety razor would offer more blade options, cheaper blades that could be swapped out more often, and a closer, more comfortable shaving experience.  After a bit of research, I settled on this Edwin Jagger De89lbl razor for my first double-edged safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived well-packaged in an Amazon box and packing pillows.  The razor itself was packed in a little black cardstock box and a bit of tissue.  There was a minimal instruction insert and a 5-pack of Derby blades.  The razor is beautiful - classic lines and a flawless finish.  It has a nice heft.  The 3 parts fit nicely together and are well made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I showered and then went to work on my first shave.  I had a cheap brush/bowl/soap combo from the grocery store (10 bucks) and my knowledge from what I had learned online (check out \\&quot;A guide to the gourmet shaving experience\\&quot; and the book \\&quot;[[ASIN:1463595344 Leisureguy&#x27;s Guide to Gourmet Shaving - Fifth Edition: Shaving Made Enjoyable]]\\&quot; here on Amazon) about DE shaving:  face prep, good lather coverage at all times, 30 degrees, with/across/against grain.  I managed to get a pretty good shave for my first time - better than the Mach 5.  I didn&#x27;t cut or abrade myself at all, though I didn&#x27;t try going against the grain.  On my second try the next day I did go against the grain for the final pass.  I still escaped injury and got a really good shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to trying other blades (Feather and WIlkinson&#x27;s Sword particularly) in a few weeks, and I think I could do with a soap that makes a better lather.  For now I&#x27;m going to use the scientific method and not change any variables unless there is a problem.  Once I run out of something I will upgrade.</li>
    <li> This is a high quality tool.  It is rather aggressive as double edged razors go, but it feels great in the hand and is heavy enough that I can mostly just let EJ and gravity do the work.</li>
    <li> Great quality you will love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m never going back to the multi-blade cartridges. The shave is good.  The feel and experience is excellent. Thank you</li>
    <li> I was heated after going to Costco and seeing a 20- pack of razors for $50!  Then and there I decided I was done with that nonsense.  As soon as I got home, I found a 100-pack of double edge blades for $15.  That was all I needed to see!  Regarding the razor handle, I did a little research both on amazon reviews and the web in general.  I don&#x27;t know why I was surprised, but there seems to be a lot of &amp;#34;instructional&amp;#34; youtube videos that are clearly part of some shaving man fetish niche!  All that aside, I ultimately settled on this razor and it has been great!  I get a great close shave that my wife loves.  It&#x27;s easier to get that close shave than with the 5+ blade disposables.  This razor also rinses with ease unlike the disposables that were impossible to rinse after a single pass.  Finally, I must admit a little unease with my first use.  I envisioned peeling my face like a carrot!  No problem though.  Setting a good angle determines the closeness of the shave and taking care to drag the razor in straight lines only keeps your skin unscathed.  I even go against the grain after first going with the grain.  Blades are good for 2 smooth shaves no problem, 3 can be done. I don&#x27;t think 4 would be wise.</li>
    <li> went back to wet shaving after getting tired of paying high prices for today&#x27;s multi blades.Started using my old gillette de razor and wondered why I ever stoped using a DE.So I decided to try the Edwin Jagger DE89Lbl. What a great buy.This razor out preforms my Gillette and is beautifully chromed.I highly recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> This thing is a beast. I love it. I got into wet shaving a couple of years ago, but never got a Merkur or Edwin Jagger - just some Lord&#x27;s and old school Schick&#x27;s and Gillettes. This thing is great. I gives me the best shave yet with my Derby blades. Plus, it looks and feels great. I hope the chrome plating lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Very nice shave.  The only thing I wish it had was a longer handle.  It gets a little slick when it gets wet.  Other than that, its worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve shaved twice now with my new razor and am impressed with how close the shave is. I have been a long-time user of the Gillette 3 Mach Turbo. I was very surprised with how thin and flexible the blades are as I only remember razor blades from about 35 years ago when my dad used to use them. I was worried about cuts/nicks being a first time user but had no issues. I&#x27;ve only shaved with the direction of my whiskers and will likely switch to both directions to get a closer cut. I use a pre-shave oil before applying shaving cream and recommend that as well.</li>
    <li> Bought this formy husband. It is a terrific razor! Just as everyone else stated. He has huge hands and is very comfortable with this razor. We got more Derby blades, added Williams soap and he is loving it! He gave up on electric razors...and razor burn! He is not a guy that grows a beard. He can go a couple says at least without shaving. Now that he used this razor, he has gone nearly a werk the shave is so smooth! Thanks for a great product Edwin Jagger!!!!</li>
    <li> This is the second DE razor that I have owned. This first being the Merkur Model 180 long handle. I&#x27;ve been wet shaving for about 5 months now (both head and face). I&#x27;ve tried many blades, creams, blah blah blah. OK..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the weight of this razor. Very well made. First thing I noticed. The blade angle is a little more aggressive than the Merkur. There was blood.. But, not the razor&#x27;s fault. I was applying unneeded pressure. YOU DO NOT NEED TO PRESS ON THE RAZOR. I&#x27;m getting closer shaves with fewer passes on my head and face with this razor. It&#x27;s more about careful, accurate passes now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also unsure of how I would react to the shorter handle as I&#x27;ve been used to a longer one my whole life. I actually like it better. I think it makes the razor more maneuverable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another aspect of shaving that the De89 has magnified is the significance of building a good lather. If I make a great lather, I have an effortless shave. If I short cut the lather process, my face/head pays. Spend a little more time in this department if you&#x27;re having trouble with this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied. I don&#x27;t know that this would be my first DE razor. It is more aggressive than the Merkur. With practice, I&#x27;ve grown to like this razor better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing. Try many different blades. Can&#x27;t recommend the DE sampler packs enough. Lots of people swear by the Derby blades that this ships with... I can&#x27;t stand them. They pull on my beard and gap my %$# up . The Astra SP blades work wonders for me. It really makes a difference - don&#x27;t knock the razor until you&#x27;ve tried many blades and improve your technique. Plenty of youtube videos out there to help you learn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars. I will use this razor for a long time.</li>
    <li> This is a nicely made piece.  I have been using this safety razor for almost a month now and am really enjoying it.  It well made and the accompanying blades are also quite smooth.  I am relatively lightly barded, so each blade lasts me about ten days.  The yearly cost savings will be very dramatic.  I admit that I did have to learn to shave all over again, but now I wonder how I got lured into the $5.00 apiece multi-bladed heads everyone uses now.  I&#x27;ll never go back to the multi-bladed heads again.  This thing is wonderful.</li>
    <li> Thinking this type of razor that I once used would be better than today&#x27;s models, battery operated, multi-bladed and electric, I purchased this razor.  Even using an excellent lather (Truitt), my other razors out--performed the Jagger.  Blades for it are cheaper than battery and multi-bladed ones.  However, the savings are worth it.  Most people avoid close shaves.  I wanted one.</li>
    <li> Well made. Nicely weighted. I like it. Simple as that. Beats the daylights out of disposables or over priced multi-blade razors.</li>
    <li> This is a very high quality DE razor which is heavy and a nice chrome finish.  I was shaving with a Parker for 2 weeks and was getting razor burn (was it me being a newbie to wet shaving or do I now have the right technique or was the Parker 99 more aggressive???).  Anyway, the Edwin Jagger DE89Lbl works great and I have not got razor burn even though I make 4 passes each time I shave.  I am using Person Blue blades. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This razor is heavy as compare to cartridge types.  I like it due to fact that I don&#x27;t need to apply any pressure to get a smooth shave.</li>
    <li> I use to use a double edge razor many years ago, and then got caught up in the cartridge revolution! But today cartridges are so expensive I decided to give the double edge razor a go! I forgot what a great shave you get from one of these! I can shave with a new blade everyday for a year on the same amount I spent for 1 month of cartridges! I love It!</li>
    <li> Switching from the multiple blade plastic razors to a double edge is something I wish I did long ago. I&#x27;m not one to evangelize over a dumb product but I&#x27;ve gotten this same razor for my Father and brother in law and the both love it. I wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted so much money on the Mach 3s over the years. Buy this razor and 100 razor blades and you&#x27;re good for a long long time.</li>
    <li> This is a beautifully built razor for an affordable price. Fit and finish is excellent, nice weight. I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> This is a super nice razor. It&#x27;s very sturdy and well balanced.  I will note that after about two years of use of my first one, I dropped it in the shower and the head broke off.  But I replaced it with a second one because it works really well.  I use this with Cremo Shave Cream, a Semogue 1305 Superior Boar Bristle Shaving Brush, and Astra Superior Premium Platinum Double Edge Safety Razor Blades. This is a great combo, especially when I shave in the shower, using my Cassani - Fogless Shower Mirror</li>
    <li> I purchased this to replace the numerous disposable razors that i have bought and accumulated that have worn out after 1 or 2 shaves. I was tired of throwing things away and the feel of the disposable was always an issue, sometimes having to press down on my face to get a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;My first shave with this razor produced the best shave I have had in a long time. although the handle is a bit short, I feel it compliments the heavy head well, allowing the razor to sit naturally on my face. Excellent product, and well worth the money.</li>
    <li> This is my second Jagger (got one to keep in my travel kit rather than swap back and forth) but rather than just add to the kudos for the excellent Jagger razors, here&#x27;s a nifty modification:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may find after becoming familiar with this fine razor that you&#x27;d like a bit more aggressive shave than the mid range exposure of these. If so, take a razor blade and cut off the edges with scissors (yep, you can), then sandwich the dummy blade under the real one as a shim (dummy toward handle, real blade on top). This increases the blade gap slightly and will give you a more aggressive shave. Some folks even use two or three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that increasing the aggression means a bit more care is needed, so you beginners get your technique down before trying this, eh?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was an old trick back in the day, and it still works. I find one shim does a better overall shave for me with my fav blades : Russian Astra, Israeli Crystal, German Wilkinson, and US Personna Blue.</li>
    <li> This was my first double edge razor and I really enjoy it.  It is easy to use and also easy to clean.  I have not cut myself once since I started using this product.</li>
    <li> Love the razor, heavier than the merkur 180, feels better in hand.  I had a chroming issue with the head and contacted Edwin Jagger through their website.  They asked for pictures and asked how I took care of the razor, to my surprise they stood behind thier product and sent a replacement head along with shaving samples.  Will highly recommend.  blades work for softer beards, mine is too rough.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it!  He has a very thick beard and has always complained that when his blade gets the least bit dull, he ends up with pulled hairs and nicks.  He has also been complaining of late of the HIGH cost of replacement razor blades for the newer razors and complaining that the blades didn&#x27;t seem to last any length of time at all.  Now he can use straight razor blades and replace them as needed and as often as he wants because they don&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg!  Sometimes new products are not always better products.  This is a nice, solid razor and is made very well. He said he would recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> This razor is great.  The chrome is flawless and everything goes together very well.  The handle and weight work well together as a razor.</li>
    <li> Takes a little getting used to, but the shave is as good as the modern cartridges. Definitively old school, reminds me of my grandfathers 1930 razor..</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my boyfriend and he loves it.  Has a nice weight to it,  sleek design and creates a close shave.</li>
    <li> I like this razor, but my review may be worthless as this is my first DE Razor.  It seems to have a nice weight to it, but the Derby blades sure don&#x27;t agree with my face.</li>
    <li> My first safety razor and I am super happy to have gone with the Edwin Jagger. This thing looks classy all the way. I like how it fits in your hand, the weight, and the overall build quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2/5/13 - I&#x27;ve been using this safety razor for about a month and I have to stand by initial review. It has great balance and so easy to use. Considering that I am a noob in wet shaving, I decided to pair the Edwin Jagger to Feather blades and wow it was an amazing shave!!!! No irritation, no nicks... just smooth skin. The Ediwin Jagger&#x27;s weight and balance just gives you the right amount of pressure to not slit your throat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do think, though, that getting some good soap is an important addition to this beautiful razor. I highly recommend look up Mike&#x27;s Natural&#x27;s Soaps. Great lather and lubrication for your perfect Edwin Jagger experience! Good luck guys!</li>
    <li> I still like my Merkur long handle best.  It is easier to use and no irritation.  This one is more harsh when going for baby butt smooth.  With Merkur or Feather blades, this one does a nice job... the handle is a tad slick too compared with my other razors.</li>
    <li> I learned how to shave on a Gillette DE that belonged to my grandpa when I was 15 or so. It was probably at least from the 40&#x27;s and was a solid performer. I never did get my own and eventually I stopped DE shaving when I moved to college because it was much quicker to just shave with those multi-blade garbage razors. Sometime ago, because of cost, I switched to disposables that I used to pick up down at RiteAid/CVS. Well, recently I needed to shave a 7 day beard, pulled out my new disposables and ended up with the worst shave of my life right before a dinner party. It took three razors for one shave. I was so livid, that the next morning I looked up DE razors and searched for about a day or two before deciding on this one. It has a nice weight, great chrome finish and I love the lines on the handle. Highly recommend this razor if you are getting into DE shaving or to add to an existing line-up. I also purchased this DE for my brother and a friend as gifts and had another friend buy it based on my recommendation. All three are happy and satisfied to get a fantastic shave and finally be free of the expense of cartridge shaving. I recommend this Razor for anyone that desires to be a Free Man while looking good being free again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I ordered this razor for myself. It has the lines on the handle for extra grip. The friend also ordered this, but the other two I ordered as gifts are the EJ DE89 without the lines on the handle.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor. The weight and length is perfect, the blade angle is just right, and it assembles easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cut myself once, and that was from bringing it toward my face too quickly. No razor burn or bad scrapes here.</li>
    <li> The handle was too short to please me.  And the stock blades sent with it were not very sharp.</li>
    <li> Solid and great looking.  The closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> This razor is pure quality. It is my favorite razor now and I recommend it to anyone that wet shaves or is looking to get into wet shaving. It is a pleasure to shave with. Well done Edwin Jagger!</li>
    <li> I purchased a cheaper model and wouldn&#x27;t do it again.... Spend the money on this one its worth the price....</li>
    <li> First safety razor, my face was smooth as silk. I recommend watching a few youtube videos on how to properly shave with a safety razor. It is far superior to the razors that are out now with the multiple blades. But, I do realize it will take a few shaves before i can comfortably adjust to this razor, i did knick myself a few times, it is an adjustment. but just a fun razor to shave with, and gets all those hairs</li>
    <li> I am in love with this. I didn&#x27;t know what I was missing till I used it. Been using it for several weeks now. I did good on this purchase.</li>
    <li> This is a BEAUTIFUL razor.  The chrome is so polished it looks like a brand-new mini motorcycle muffler.  The detailing is classy and understated.  It has a nice weight to it and is perfectly machined and symmetrical.  It is a 3-piece and feels sturdy even when disassembled.  It holds a blade steady and true with even reveal on both sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle length is on the shorter side.  I have large hands and had been shaving with a 4&amp;#34; Parker handle, so the length will take some getting used to.  But, otherwise it shaves very nicely, making the most of whatever blade you put in it.</li>
    <li> In my attempts to find the perfect razor for starting my path into wet shaving , I choose this razor , and could not be happier !  I think this is the perfect razor for anyone looking for their first safety razor.  It has a very good weight that feels great in your hand.  The weight provides the ability to let the weight of the razor perform the stroke rather than having to pull , and I like that.  I have used it for about a month now , and believe that it will hold up for a very long time . Also the design provides for easy cleaning .</li>
    <li> Looks beautiful. Easy to handle and to clean. The right length and weight in my hand.  My one caveat would be that other razors with more texture may provide more grip.</li>
    <li> LOVE this Edwin Jagger. It has an awesome weight to it and feels comfortable in the hand. The handle is designed to never slip even with heavy water or whatever you manage to get on it while shaving. Easy twist off for razor replacement. I&#x27;ve own  it for about a year and it&#x27;s still the same color chromed it hasn&#x27;t build any rust or discoloring.</li>
    <li> Husband loves this razor!  Makes a great gift!</li>
    <li> What a great razor.  After a few shaves, I felt an immediate and irrevocable bond with this highly polished piece of forged metal beauty.  Shave time has become ME time.  Dragging this thing over your beard makes you feel like your Clint freaking Eastwood.  Grab yourself this razor, a quality badger brush, a good shaving bowl, and some avocado shave cream by Taylor of Old Bond Street and you&#x27;re magically whisked away to a better place.  A place where you don&#x27;t have to spend $50 on razor cartridges every time you go to Costco.  A place where your wife doesn&#x27;t even bother to hijack your razor to shave her legs in the shower, simply because your Edwin Jagger looks too menacing and manly for a women to even bother.  It&#x27;s a wonderful place.  And this is a wonderful razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you buy this razor, be prepared for a little bit of a learning curve.  It takes a little bit of practice to become a Man&#x27;s man.  But you&#x27;ll get there.  And you&#x27;ll thank me for this recommendation when you wake up and can&#x27;t wait to carve an extra 10 minutes out of your morning to shave like a man should, with your Edwin Jagger, a real man&#x27;s tool.</li>
    <li> i havent tried any other shaving other than straight blade and this (plus the generic bic/gillette type disposable bleh, and electric) I prefer these with the BIC and Gillette blades so far. i&#x27;ve tried some of the other recommended but my face prefers the BIC and gillettes.</li>
    <li> Great looking razor! I&#x27;m sure you have all read the reviews on this razor so I&#x27;m going to be brief. The positive reviews are all true. I switched from a Gillette Fusion Pro Glide to this razor and got used to it within a week. The weight is perfect and with a good blade (my favorites: Feather &amp; Red Israeli Personna) you get a very close shave. A very good investment for sure. Excellent craftsmanship!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to double edge safety razor shaving.  I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 months now, 2-3 times a week.  I switched because I didn&#x27;t want to spend money on Gilette cartridges anymore.  They didn&#x27;t ever give a comfortable shave(not that I ever took time to shave like I have to do now).  This is a great razor.  It is mild so it&#x27;s perfect for beginners like me.  I have not had any cuts with it.  It is beautifully crafted and the blades self center when you install them, though I always look down the edges of the razor to make sure.  I went throught the sampler of Derby blades(they worked fine) and then bought the 100 pack of Personna blades off Amazon for $12.  The Personnas are only slightly sharper than the Derby but seem to last a little longer.  I bought the cheap Van Der Hagen Premium Shave Set which works better than you expect for $8, but recently upgraded to Taylor of Old Bond Street Shave Cream(Avocado).</li>
    <li> It is indeed a thing of beauty, works great too.  The problem is the stud looks like cheap casted steel, mine broke today, and I got it in April, that&#x27;s unacceptable for this quality name.  For that I would not recommend, my Merkur&#x27;s has lasted years of use and abuse in sub-freezing and extreme hot temperatures.  I clean all of them regularly to prevent deposits from getting into the steel.  The Jagger will be thrown out and not purchased again.</li>
    <li> After reading a lot of reviews decided to try this.  I have never used anything other than the popular 5 blade razor, and was a little worried about using this older style razor.  I&#x27;m not going to write a long review, there are already a lot of good reviews, I just want to say there is a learning curve to switching to this style of razor; that being said after some practice you get a great shave and I have yet to cut myself open like I thought I would.  All and all very good razor.  And hoping to save a lot on buying blades.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, but I&#x27;d get the longer handle one if I bought it again. Blades shipped with razor no good. Get the long handle.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this DE razor.  If you like paying about 15 cents for a DE blade as opposed to paying about $4 per blade for the newer multi-blades common in the modern razors (and getting about the same number of good shaves per blade) this Edwin Jagger is a very good option.  Old fashioned shaving is the new rage, dude!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll keep this short and sweet so you&#x27;ll quickly know the reason behind the epic failure of this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my first foray into safety razor territory after having become fed up with the constant change and rising cost of the cartridge style razors. After much research I settled on this razor. After a few weeks I was able to make decent nick free use of this razor. The shaves I was getting were so close that I didn&#x27;t need to shave every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a while, I noticed a very slight indentation in the curved top plate. Right above where the threaded screw is. I was very careful with my razor. Cleaned it after every use. Made sure it was dry after every use. As mentioned, I wasn&#x27;t using it more than 2 or 3 times per week. I was obviously over tightening the head, but didn&#x27;t realize. No way was I being heavy handed with it, but still over tightening must have been the cause of the slight indentation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t affect the performance of the razor and I was definitely more careful after I noticed the indentation. Then, just a few days ago and about a year since my purchase, I was GENTLY tightening up the head and the threaded screw sheared off the top plate. Thus rendering the razor completely useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll just have to take my word for it that I was not applying some serious torque when tightening up the razor head. The join of the threaded screw to the bottom side of the top plate must be a major weakness of this razor and when it fails it ruins the razor for good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not one of those who will go after the manufacturer (kudos to those that do). I just threw it out in disgust, vowed to never buy an Edwin Jagger again and will switch to a Merkur which was my second choice when I was originally trying to choose which razor to go for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buyer beware and happy shaving.</li>
    <li> Looks great, nice and heavy feel. For some reason I still get cuts with safety razors, I used the same with my straight blade too. Not sure why. My Mach3 doesn&#x27;t feel as nice but cuts much better and safer.</li>
    <li> This is an update on the performance of the Edwin Jagger DE89Lbl razor.  I bought this razor about 4 months ago.  This was a nice razor, but I discovered, as many others have, that the razor is poorly constructed.  I dropped the razor from sink level onto a thick shag bath mat.  The threaded screw on the cap broke off!  It appears to be some cheap type of coated metal.  I think pot metal would be several times stronger than this substance.  I will not try and replace the razor as shipping and parts make it prohibitive.  Nice while it lasted, but be aware this is not a quality built razor.</li>
    <li> Nice, simple, and solid.</li>
    <li> Leaps and bounds better than the $12 Chinese razor I got to &amp;#34;try out&amp;#34; safety razors without spending much. I wouldn&#x27;t bother going that route, and just start with this instead. The cheap twist-to-opens are a much worse experience, and I really can&#x27;t see anyone disliking safety razors if they currently use mach3-style cartridges. With the cheap twist-to-open, I wasn&#x27;t nicking myself particularly more than with this, but I could distinctly tell that a razor blade was running down my face. This is because the cheap twist-to-open doesn&#x27;t bend the blade nearly as much, leaving it almost completely straight against your face. More importantly, the blade stuck out a bit from the top and bottom guards, making it very aggressive. This Edwin Jagger razor bends the blade nicely and it&#x27;s lined up with the guards almost perfectly, so if you feel the two guards against your face you know it&#x27;s working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this Edwin, I can barely tell there&#x27;s a blade at all, but it&#x27;s still delivers an extremely close shave. Only got significant nicks on my neck, which is always a problem area with shaving. I&#x27;ve only shaved with safety razors about 5 times at this point, so I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll learn how to go easier on my neck with time. The nicks aren&#x27;t more severe than with a mach3, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fear of safety razors is largely misinformed, it&#x27;s very difficult to cut yourself significantly. Don&#x27;t be scared! It takes a while to get the hang of but the lifetime of saving an extremely large amount of money is well worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this razor.  It&#x27;s a nice size, has a sturdy weight in the hand and feels like it will last pretty much forever with reasonable use.</li>
    <li> I wish I had not waited so long to switch to using a double edge razor.It just staggers my mind how much money I wasted over the last 40+ years on multi-blade razors not to mention the unbelievable close shave this razor delivers.I now look forward to shaving since it gives me a refreshing feel that I haven&#x27;t experienced since my last shave from a barber.This razor gives me all the things I was looking for in a razor and certainly will last much longer than I will.I have shown it to all the YOUNG guys(30 - 40) at work and they are amazed with its sturdiness and construction and say they plan on switching over very soon.They also see the value in the amount of money they will save over their lifespan versus the multi-blade razors.Edwin Jagger certainly has a top notch product here and I would highly reccomend this to any shaver.</li>
    <li> I started shaving old school about two years ago after finding my dad&#x27;s old shave kit. Cake soap and brush, single edge razor. My total annual cost for shaving is less than $20 dollars. I highly recommend getting back to basics when it comes to shaving. Single edge razors offer less irritation, fewer ingrown hairs, healthier appearing skin and significantly lower cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I am no expert on safety razors, this one seems to be of exceptional quality. It is beautifully chrome plated, nicely weighted and very well balanced. I have rather large hands, and even though the handle of this razor is not as log as I would like it to be, I have had no issue with control or slipping. The blade fits securely with close precision so there is no issue with movement or having the blade at the wrong angle. This is just a fine quality shaving instrument that should offer many years of service.</li>
    <li> I have a &amp;#34;cow lick&amp;#34; on my neck, which has made shaving a painful nightmare. I&#x27;ve tried everything under the sun. I&#x27;ve used everything from the disposable razors to a $200 electric. All of them left my neck irritated and raw after one or two shaves. The De89lbl is a completely different story though. After learning how to use it (it took a few tries), I get the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had, with minimal irritation. Oddly, even if I do &amp;#34;nick&amp;#34; myself with this razor, the cuts don&#x27;t linger. They&#x27;re usually gone by the time I&#x27;m done shaving. Overall, I definitely recommend this razor to someone looking for a better shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advice:&lt;br /&gt;There are a TON of different blades out there, and they do make a difference. I personally like the &amp;#34;Shark&amp;#34; blades because they&#x27;re uber sharp and I have crazy thick facial hair. I would suggest buying a variety pack of blades along with this razor if you haven&#x27;t used a safety razor before. Also, invest in a shave set (soap and a brush). The soap, to me, is way better and cheaper than any cream you&#x27;re going to buy at Wal-Mart. As far as using the razor... It require MINIMAL pressure to shave with. Let the weight of the razor do the work, or you&#x27;ll be bleeding like a stuck pig. Watch a tutorial or read up on proper safety razor shaving before diving in. It will save you skin, and make you way happier with your purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Durable&lt;br /&gt;Provides a GREAT shave with the proper blade and technique&lt;br /&gt;Manly&lt;br /&gt;way cheaper than replacing the blades on your electric or &amp;#34;reusable&amp;#34; razaors&lt;br /&gt;Solid, heavy feel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The handle is a little shorter than you may be expecting (may the length of a deck of cards)... but I knew this when I bought it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a little getting used to.... As I mentioned above, learn how to use this thing before hacking up your face and neck. There are some great tutorials online</li>
    <li> Very nice looking double-edged razor and does a great job.</li>
    <li> This razor is made by a well known and reputable company. The razor looks nice and seems to be made very well. I&#x27;ve had some really nice shaves with this razor and have zero regrets. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> Razor reviews should be viewed as subjective, the &amp;#34;my razor is better than your razor&amp;#34; types of reviews hold NO credibility on certain &amp;#34;facts&amp;#34; alone - with that in mind, here is my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fit and finish is perfect, weight of handle to head ratio feels good in the hand and allows the head and blade to do the work as you just use your hand to tilt slightly and guide the razor direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design has lines, or raised curved ridges running in parallel with the handle that allows you to have a firm grip on the razor - I know this as I am one arm / hand handicapped at the moment and have NO problems at all just using the one hand to hold, and rotate as necessary the razor in just the one hand with out having to lay it down and re-position my grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model has a closed comb at the safety bar, this makes it a little less &amp;#34;aggressive&amp;#34; - in that less of the blade is open and exposed and applied directly to your skin.  All features of size, weight, comb, aggressive or not need to be paired to your face contour and whisker direction, density, and coarseness.  There is no such thing as one size fits all, or one that is better than any other because of a persons individual body and hair characteristics.  This can make trial and error a bit expensive using just the razor, or swapping out with a replacement handle to change weight ratios and length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knowing all of this, I choice this model based on quality, features, and to some extent pricing.  I was looking for a bit more tame, or less aggressive razor and opted to experiment with finding a perfect match of razor to face by testing different blades - also rated for sharpness and &amp;#34;aggressiveness&amp;#34; .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with razors, the blades themselves will be subjective as to the comfort and closeness they provide - again based on your face and whisker textures.  I found the supplied Derby brand of blades that came with the razor to not be a match for my face, I am switching over to the Personna blades, and may tweak to the Crystal brand if necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a more than modest neck scar (in a crease line) that I need to pay attention to while shaving, the closed comb of this razor has served me well in that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My suggestions:  Use a less aggressive razor, and tune in an aggressive blade unless you already know your whisker coarseness rivals that of sandpaper where an open comb safety bar would be better suited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a three piece razor, I wish they had a two piece with the same features and handle length, and head weight, they do not, I knew that, and am not deducting any stars for that.  I do deduct one star for one reason, the DE blades supplied stick out (on the non-shaving sides) past the head dome and deck.  Though they do not pose a real hazard to your face or other body parts while shaving, they do make holding the head and handle for disassembly a hazard to your fingers tips if and as holding the head by the side edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this razor if it fits your needs, quality, features, pricing are all there - give it try.my face, I am switching over to the Personna blades, and may tweak to the Crystal brand if necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a more than modest neck scar (in a crease line) that I need to pay attention to while shaving, the closed comb of this razor has served me well in that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My suggestions:  Use a less aggressive razor, and tune in an aggressive blade unless you already know your whisker coarseness rivals that of sandpaper where an open comb safety bar would be better suited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a three piece razor, I wish they had a two piece with the same features and handle length, and head weight, they do not, I knew that, and am not deducting any stars for that.

    <li> I own this and a merkur futur. This is a great razor and I recommend it to all who are starting in wet shaving.</li>
    <li> i can see the light now</li>
    <li> This little item is great. Saves quite a bit of money on shaving products and accessories (replacement razors cost anywhere from $0.25 - $3.00 a pack), and it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin irritated with razor bumps and dry skin the way that most double or triple blade disposable razors do. I have very sensitive skin - I am in my late twenties and still break out occasionally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very steep learning curve - the first few uses, make sure you have an alum block or styptic pencil - you WILL nick yourself at least once, and it&#x27;s almost impressive how much you can bleed from a small cut. Paired with a great shaving soap and brush, shaving with this will feel fantastic while lathering, shaving, and of course afterwards. If you have sensitive skin, I highly recommend also using a quality shave balm or oil to keep your face moist afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend using it in the shower; as much for safety as personal preference.</li>
    <li> A classic Merkur, a heavy duty Merkur and a butterfly Parker. The Edwin Jagger wins by a slim margin against the HD Merkur. The weight, balance, overall feel, etc...is superb. You will, in no way, be disappointed with this product. But throw away the Derby blades. Get feathers instead. Or 7 O&#x27;clock Gillette&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this Double Edger Razor for a few months and have no regrets about making the decision to purchase it. I had been using plastic double edge throw-aways for years and years and it just got to be ridiculous to have to keep buying them and I wondered about all the plastic and metal  going into the garbage. I happened upon the double edge razors and the return back to them by a lot of guys. A double edge razor was what I shaved with for a few years when I first started shaving, but at some point I went to the throw-aways, and I am not exactly sure why now. Anyway this razor is great, I may have nicked myself like once or twice and in a very minor way since using it, its such a rarity its almost not worth mentioning. This Razor is really a beautiful thing visually, the quality is exceptional. The plating is like perfect and it really shines. Its a work of art really. You do not see things made like this much at all today. It has a classic look, something you&#x27;d imagine your grandfather shaving with. I guess I have said enough there huh. Anyway, I was concerned that the handle might be too short on this razor ( I considered the long handled Merkur, but reviews of peeling plating turned me off ) but since the reviews were so good and it looked so nice, I thought I&#x27;d try this Edwin Jagger and it has worked well for me. I&#x27;m a bit over 6 feet tall and I&#x27;ve adjusted to the handle very well, its all how you hold it, closer to the shaving head works best really. Some reviews mention the handle slipping in your grip, well this can happen, even with the grooved handle like I have, just make sure your hand is reasonably dry, if its really wet take a second to dry it on a towel from time to time. I give this razor 5 stars for performance and quality . I definitely would buy this Razor again after using it for months now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Derby blades with this Edwin Jagger. I get a comfortable, reasonably smooth shave. I ordered a pack of 100 on here. I get like 4 to 5 shaves out of each blade easy. Its nice to not have to bother with the plastic throw-away razors anymore. I&#x27;ve never used the super expensive cartridge razors much, they would be oppressively expensive to use all the time, don&#x27;t know how guys can go that route.</li>
    <li> This razor is a lot better than any merkur at the same price. I would highly recommend, including to new safety razor users. I just wish it came with better blades.</li>
    <li> I gave this razor 5 stars because it definitely lives up to and exceeds our expectations. I would have been pleased even if it had been as good as a Mach type razor with the replaceable head. It far exceeds that expectation! This has got to be the nicest razor that my husband has ever used! I did a lot of research before settling on this razor. The reviews on the Shaving 101 site are what finally sold me completely on this razor. I have never seen my husband with this close of a shave in the fifteen years that we have been married.  He has only nicked himself once with this razor so far, just relax and enjoy your shaving time instead of going the slash and dash route and you will be fine. Just relax!&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this razor as a good buy. It will pay for itself within the first year just by the cheaper price of the blades. Replaceable head cartridges are insanely expensive and people really do need to find and alternative. This is it-The answer to that issue!&lt;br /&gt;My husband loved his razor so much that I tried it out and it was awesome! Once again I just encourage you to relax and enjoy the shaving experience (no slash &amp; dash!). This is such a fine piece of equipment that I could not resist and I bought myself a Merkur which I am just as pleased with. No more expensive razor cartridge heads for us!!&lt;br /&gt;I bought this razor for my husband for Father&#x27;s Day with this&lt;br /&gt;Brush: [[ASIN:B003WR3QSG B003WR3QSG]]&lt;br /&gt;Stand: [[ASIN:B00A3LVMMQ B00A3LVMMQ]]&lt;br /&gt;Soap: [[ASIN:B0071B7XCO B0071B7XCO]]&lt;br /&gt;&amp; Blades: [[ASIN:B0077LAJT2 B0077LAJT2]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B004SGKMA0 B004SGKMA0]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He absolutely loved his entire gift set!! We could not have gotten him a better and nicer set to make him feel special and appreciated. The blades? Oh what can we say about the blades? $20.00 for two hundred blades! How can you beat that? If you use one blade per week then each 100 count box should last about 2 years! We bought him two boxes so that is 4 years worthof blades for $20.00! You cannot beat that price on any other kind of razor on the market except for maybe a straight edge. So for the nicest and closest shave ever - you get the luxury of paying the least amount of money ever. Seems backwards but it is true!!&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and go ahead and take the safety razor plunge! This razor is well worth the price and you will not regret it!</li>
    <li> WOW!!! Words cannot express how my first DE (double edge) shave went with the Edwin Jagger DE89lbl went. My brother has been trying to convert me to wet shaving for a few years now but I never thought this old school art was worth the effort. If anyone is considering trying wet shaving, I suggest that you dive right into it by buying this razor. Here&#x27;s my experience. Today was my first shave ever with a safety razor. I used Cremo Cream because my badger hair brush is still in shipping. I will say that I felt cautiously confident in trying my first DE shave this morning because I have watched nearly 40 videos on the subject before my razor arrived. After taking a hot shower, I went straight into applying my Cremo and loaded the razor with the supplied Derby razor blade. I paid great attention to the blade angle and the pressure of the razor being applied to my face. I went for short strokes and cut the beard (with the grain) as taught in the videos. The razor seamed to melt right through my beard. I reduced the beard in my first pass without one nick or cut. AMAZING!!! I re-lathered by adding more water to the cream and went directly to my second pass in an (against the grain) direction. I was reluctant to go against the grain because most people perform that portion of their shave on their third pass. What would you know??? Not one nick or cut. No irritation, razor burn, or bumps. I began to take longer and longer strokes and loved the feel of this razor in my hands and against my face. This Edwin Jagger just moved effortlessly through the hairs. I literally just let the razor weight and the blade angle to all the work. I will admit that I have no ability to compare this product to others; however, I have just witnessed first hand what all the hype about this razor and wet shaving is truly about. After putting on an after shave balm/lotion, my wife and kids, after a detailed inspection, agreed with me that this morning&#x27;s shave was the best and closest shave I have ever had. It&#x27;s been 12 hours since my shave and I still cannot feel any stubble, truly baby butt smooth. After using up the 5 Derby blades, I will experiment using this AMAZING razor with some Astra blades for comparison. Furthermore, the chrome finish of this razor is awesome. It truly is a beautiful piece of simple ingenuity that I hope more people will someday experience. My only regret I have at this moment is not taking my brother&#x27;s advice sooner. Watch the GeoFatBoy review video regarding this razor. He too says WOW!!!ver had. It&#x27;s been 12 hours since my shave and I still cannot feel any stubble, truly baby butt smooth.

    <li> nice  and bloody smooth  shave mate . takes a few to get the techniqe  but with the right combo blade and shave soap you won&#x27;t go back .i rub on a few drops essential oil on  first and nicks are no more .  the razor itself .flawless mirror finish</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used a DER in many years.  This is fantastic and the weight and balance is wonderful.  Wish I had this years ago!</li>
    <li> I tried to get a close shave with this.  I used as directed. I spent plenty of time (more than I usually would with my fusion pro-glide).  The razor misses hair and I have to double/triple/quadruple shave.  I then can&#x27;t get it close.  I feel hair stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then take my regular razor (fusion pro-glide) and I can easily shave in just a few seconds to clean it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see how people say that it is a closer shave.  I tried to investigating if I was doing something wrong but...  Can&#x27;t htet it to work.</li>
    <li> This truly is a great razor. Many people talk about the finish and the look, but to me that is fairly unimportant. I bought a safety razor because I was hoping that there was a better way to shave. This has taken me two weeks, and a few painful shaves, but now that I have my technique down I can&#x27;t see myself ever going back to cartridge razors. I now get a closer shave and have less irritation and ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> Want a high quality, beautiful, forgiving safety razor?  Then, buy this one!  It looks great, it shaves great, and is more forgiving than cheaper DE razors I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to de shaving and I bought this after reading reviews and watching youtube videos. Only reason I&#x27;m giving this a 4 star is because I was hoping for the butterfly type opening to put in the blade. Instead, you have to undo the head and take apart components to put the blade in. Aside of that, it does produce a nice shave. Nicely balanced. Sometimes it does feel like it weighs too much while shaving. I&#x27;m still getting used to it though. I wish it gave  customers the choice of what pack of blades you want.</li>
    <li> Love this razor!  Top quality finish, great fit and shaves like a dream.  I have always been a fan on the 3 piece safety razor and cannot imagine getting a better shave than I get from this De89!&lt;br /&gt;I know this is just personal preference but coupling this razor with Feather blades really makes shaving a joy.</li>
    <li> The chrome on this razor is flawless!  Nice weight, easy to hold, an absolutely beautiful piece.  I&#x27;d say this is a bit more aggressive than the Merkur 180.  Looking forward to using this for many years to come!</li>
    <li> Great one to add to the group. It has the standard EJ/Muhle head and is very comfy, It does have a different angle to a vintage gillette so be sure to adjust your angle to what feels comfortable and use good product that&#x27;s slippery for the blade/razor for your protection. Never shave over a dry spot. Use common sense and you&#x27;ll get a great shave.</li>
    <li> I love this razor.  This is my very fist safety razor and I am impressed.  It looks and feels very high quality, and the performance has been amazing.  Very happy with this item.</li>
    <li> Pros: Excellent build quality&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The razor is much too mild and skips over thick whiskers without cutting.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Nice looking DE razor that works well on fine whiskers but will not cut the coarse whiskers, regardless of the brand of blade used.  This was not my first DE razor, but if it had been, I most likely would have gone back to a Mach 3.  I have had much better results with Merkur and Weber razors.</li>
    <li> The razor works fine.  Some might like the lower blade angle as it has a nice feel.  I still prefer my old Gillette for a more consistent shave.  But the real reason I can&#x27;t use it is that it&#x27;s not safe for this old engineer with less than steady hands.  I cut myself  - not on the blade - but it&#x27;s edge while trying to loosen the top for cleaning.  It&#x27;s not worth the pain and trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wrote the seller, iSpotBeauty, and they would fully refund an unused product.  I wrote back to see if there is any refund for a used razor, but haven&#x27;t received the courtesy of a reply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think twice before buying this razor.</li>
    <li> Upgraded to this razor from a Merkur Vision.  While the Merkur Vision is a good razor it repeatedly broke and the adjustment mechanism seized.  The EJ is simple, has an excellent finish, and provides a superior shave.</li>
    <li> This is my first DE Razor I have owned so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to. After 2 shaves I will not go back to electric or cartridge razors.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;The razor has a nice weight to it. It feels good holding it in your hand&lt;br /&gt;Nice close shave - after a few passes it&#x27;s the closest shave I&#x27;ve had&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;If I had any negative it would be with the included blades - when shaving there is some pull - this could be the blades or my technique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a fantastic first DE razor. It&#x27;s looks fantastic out of the box and feels good in the hand while shaving.</li>
    <li> Blades: With light beard I am getting two weeks use per blade.  I did not chose them, they came with my razor purchase.  My first introduction resulted in an affirmative experience.  I hope you have good luck with them as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Razor:  It must be disassembled to install a blade or clean thoroughly.  It will flush after shaving by loosing the handle.  I have yet to receive a nick, however I do let the razor weight do the cutting, I use no additional pressure, simply let the razor do what it is designed to do by it&#x27;s own weight.</li>
    <li> Razor does everything I have asked of it so far.  Still learning how to best use it.  But it is easy to change the blade and keep clean.</li>
    <li> As I am still a beginner and am still using this razor I highly recommend it. The angle of the blade is neither too aggressive nor to subtle. While the Derby blades included were a wonderful introduction to the world of safety razor shaving I found there to be others which performed better for me - namely the Gillette Silver Blues</li>
    <li> I gifted this to my bf along with the Van Der Hagen Men&#x27;s set about 5 months ago. He still uses it regularly and loves it. It&#x27;s got some weight to it, so it looks and feels like good quality. You need to buy the blades separate, and I can&#x27;t recall what brands we use, but everything we&#x27;ve bought has worked with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 12/2016: I also use this sometimes now! The cost of these blades compared to the cost of ladies razors is insane, so I gave it a try. The first use, I got a nasty cut on my knee and ankle. No pain or scaring as these blades are super sharp. Didn&#x27;t know I cut myself until I saw the blood. With a little more practice, this is now my preferred shave. I feel like I get a closer, slightly longer lasting shave, and the price per blade can&#x27;t be beat. I like the weight of this razor, and find it comfortable to handle. It&#x27;s not perfect, but easier than I expected it to be to maneuver. Ours is several years old now and still going strong!</li>
    <li> the craftsmanship is great.  I love the feel of it in my hand and the way it presses against my skin.  It bends the blade a bit when you put it together, which may be part of why I get such a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t believe some people would rather have an ultra-light razor with multiple blades.  Just not the same.</li>
    <li> The best shave i ever had, smooth shave no irritation. I am happy with it and i love it this edwin jagger</li>
    <li> First one I&#x27;ve ever used but Iike it. Has a little weight to it.</li>
    <li> This razor is exactly what I had hoped it would be.  Immaculate chrome plate, mechanically perfect, well balanced, medium aggression, a perfect fit for my hand, and not a cut or nick in sight after shaving.  What more can I say? This razor is worth every penny and then some. Don&#x27;t waste your time trying cheapo razors to see if you&#x27;ll like DE shaving, or if you&#x27;re an old hand at the game.  This razor is a thing of beauty.  I own 4 DE razors and this one out performs all of them and has the looks to match!</li>
    <li> This little safety razor is just so awesome. it looks great and it shaves great, if you know how to shave with one. I like it better, way better then disposable razors, i even like it better then straight razors becuse its easyer to handle. I am extreamly satisfied with this purchase! Highly recomend this product to anyone who shaves.</li>
    <li> This is a great DE razor.  It is highly chromed.  I&#x27;ve used it a three months now.  There are no signs of wear or rust or soap build-up.  The razor is  quality chromed.  It has perfect balance for shaving.  It comes apart into three pieces, so you may pack it carefully when traveling and thoroughly wipe it clean. It&#x27;s a great razor and it could be the last one you will ever have to buy.  This could be passed down to your grand children. It&#x27;s that solidly built.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful item.&lt;br /&gt;First off, I ordered it at 5:30PM on a saturday and It was waiting for me on Monday when I got home from work. Thanks Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, the quality of this razor is great. Nice heavy weight and the chrome is BEAUTIFUL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first time using a safety razor and the results were great. No nicks or irritation and a crazy smooth shave.</li>
    <li> Very sleek and perfectly weighted in your hand, this gives such a closer shave than any fusion/shick. It takes a little more time and finess to shave but well worth it.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality and top notch shaver. Very happy customer.</li>
    <li> If you are like me and are tired of the shaving companies acting like the oil companies and gouging us on their prices for razors and razor blades, look no further.  I have been shaving for 45 years and decided enough was enough, I am not going to pay $15 for a three pack of razor blades, regardless of how good they shave.  After doing some research, I decided on going back to a safety razor like I watched my dad shave with years ago.  This razor is very well made, has good heft, the fit is very good, lots of threads on the razor head stud, and good length of the handle.  The chrome finish is first rate, looks like it should be on a old classic Ford or Chevy. It shaves very, very smooth with the enclosed Derby Blades, in fact I ordered more of the Derby Blades.  I get a very close shave, no nicks, no razor burn, and realized that I have not had a shave this good in years.  Please note that I have used both the shaving soap and brush as well as the Gillette Foamy for Sensitive Skin and had great shaves with both, and I finish my shave with some Mennen Afta lotion.  You will not be disappointed in ordering this razor, the price is worth it as you will get a razor that will last for many years!</li>
    <li> prefect, just what i needed.great shipping, product was as described.</li>
    <li> This is a well made very nice razor. It shaves mild and smooth using Astra SP blades. While it&#x27;s a mild shaver it gives a very close shave with no razor burn with 3 passes. Worth every penny</li>
    <li> A beautiful, well designed tool.  I researched DE safety razors for about 6 weeks before I chose the EJ 89Lbl. I haven&#x27;t shaved with a DE razor since the 60&#x27;s and switched to the latest and greatest multi blade razors when they appeared.  I shave my face and head (chrome dome) and was concerned with the learning curve and associated nicks and cuts I would have to experience.  To my amazement after my first shave a smooth face and head (better than my mach 3), no cuts or nicks and at a cost of  only a few cents not $2 a blade. It took me no longer to shave than with my multi blade razor, fewer passes needed which also meant no razor burn.  I would give this more than 5 stars if possible.</li>
    <li> excellent razor recommended</li>
    <li> Bought my husband and son a safety razor for Christmas and I borrowed my husband&#x27;s one day. I knew I had to have my own. This one is a nice weight and works great.</li>
    <li> I have a few razors and it may be my preference but I like a longer razor. This is very short and I found it uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> it nice, works very well. but sometimes screwing them together doesn&#x27;t work. like the threads aren&#x27;t align correctly or something</li>
    <li> Did my research on this product before I made the buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was between this and Merkur 34C and have to say I love my choice. Thing is absolutely gorgeous and provides a fantastic shave. The weight is nicely balanced and the handle length is just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a little maintenance here and there this thing will last me for probably a life time.</li>
    <li> Quality is excellent great shave.</li>
    <li> This is my first safety razor in a lot of years and it seems pretty good. The chrome plating looks to be good quality and everything fits together as I imagine it should.  One thing I do find is that it seems a little heavy and when wet with soap it can be a bit slippery which initially made it a little difficult to control. I do like using it but I also find that if I have any tiny bumps or blemishes that I end up bleeding a little. A styptic pencil would probably be a good idea to have on hand to stop the blood from the little nicks or scrapes. I don&#x27;t think any of this is the fault of the razor but more me and my skin texture.</li>
    <li> works nice, get a close shave. I use taylor and bond cream and canned foam. sorry purists but I get a better shave with the canned stuff. closer shave and less nicks and cuts with Brut foam. I use the taylor on the weekend when I have more time just to use it up but will stick with canned stuff. I read all of the negatives about canned stuff and it has all these bad ingredients in it etc, does not bother me one bit. I go by actual results and get the best shave with this razor using foam from a can, plus it sames me a lot of time in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the first razor was sent back due to some bad chrome plating (bubbles in the finish) that probably would have been fine but annoyed me. the replacement razor was flawless. It also fell a foot into the sink and no damage etc. Nice razor, good balance and close shave for the most part. I have a dark beard and since these razors do not shave the hair below the skin, still have some shadow at times in the jawline/neck area.</li>
    <li> I am 22 years old and have blonde hair on my head and face. I was tired of having to keep buying blades and was looking to actually enjoy shaving, rather then not shaving for days because i didn&#x27;t like it. This is handmade in england and comes in a nice classy box. I was honestly nervous about shaving with this razor because im kinda a little girl when it comes to cutting my face :/ some people on here say there is a learning curve but after i did a few passes i caught on right away and it was relativly easy. It feels simular to shaving with anything else in my opinion. I bought the Taylor of Old Bond shaving cream sandlewood which smells very nice and the scent actually stays on your face for about 2 hours and it smells great. Overall im really happy i bought it and i am happy i dont have to spend any more money on shaving for awhile. It did cost me a little under $120 bucks at first for everything i needed. Very easy to clean and i look forward to shaving everytime! This razor will make you feel more like a man....</li>
    <li> Have had this razor for two weeks but it&#x27;s quite obviously a wonderfully built product. But, please PLEASE pay attention when people say this is very different than using the plastic this or mostly plastic that.  While the newer convenience razors are exactly that, they simply don&#x27;t shave as closely as an old-fashioned product like this. But, of course, that&#x27;s not only the good news, it&#x27;s the bad news. Sharp, sharp, sharp. If you have sensitive skin as I do, you need to really learn how to shave correctly--and slowly. Not sure I&#x27;m going to keep using this because I simply may be too impatient for it. If you have time to use it correctly you&#x27;re going to love it. If you don&#x27;t, you&#x27;re going to bleed.</li>
    <li> Before i start describing this review, i want to say this is my first DE razor and that it really gets the job done. i am 20 years old and have tried any \\&quot;commercial\\&quot; razor you may say or have seen on Tv(any price and brand). first, i got this razor after reading some reviews and think they were lies. However,after the first three shaves( a nick here a nick there), i improved(no more nicks) and saw results.in other words,thanks to this device i no longer get those annoying razor bumps.also, i enjoy shaving and it no longer feels like a chore(shave every two days). i TOTALLY recommend switching to DE razors and try this one if you are a beginner. Just remember, some may not get the proper technique at the first day like me. However, with practice the story changes</li>
    <li> I recently got this razor along with a Merkur. Both are high quality and work well, but the Edwin Jagger edges out the Merkur. The weight &amp; size make it super comfortable for big hands like mine. The chrome finish is also a bit nicer on the Edwin Jagger. I&#x27;m constantly rotating the two razors for further long-time evaluation. The key to shaving this method is to TAKE YOUR TIME. Give yourself 20 to 30 minutes. Enjoy a good shave!</li>
    <li> Great to hold with the lined version (lbl). I was choosing between the Merkur 34C and this EJ and finally chose this razor. The length of the razor is Ok to hold.</li>
    <li> Great razor! Absolutely recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is my entry into DE shaving and I am hooked.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and super fast delivery!</li>
    <li> comfortably heavy in your hand; nicely chromed finish;  solid, stable, delivers a smooth, efficient and effective shave; a pleasure to use; a reminder of the importance of craftsmanship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bought one for my son, to pass along the tradition, along with some Williams cup soap (like my grandfather and father used) a badger brush, and a porcelain mug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;am trying Pinaud aftershave from CVS; a 200 yr old recipe cant be all bad</li>
    <li> So much better than The Art of Shaving.. and a WAY better price.</li>
    <li> This thing works great.  Ditch the multi-blade monstrosities of marketing and gullibility.  It cuts easy, close, and comfortably without clogging.  And box of 100 blades for less than 10 dollars is a shockingly good value.  How this type of blade went out of style in favor of inferior modern safety razors is a testament to the market&#x27;s ability to sell snow to an Eskimo -- not utility or value of any kind.</li>
    <li> An excellent double edge safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the handle just doesn&#x27;t have the same level of grip as my Merkur 34C.&lt;br /&gt;I use shaving oil a lot and the handle can get a little slippery. Not a deal breaker, but noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent razor with great balance.&lt;br /&gt;I use it as my secondary razor for travel.</li>
    <li> My facial hair is really easy to shave. I simply shave in the shower or right after. This razor is a snap to use and super easy to clean.Just be careful while handling it! I knicked a finger while in the shower. The cut was so small but it bled like crazy. After using this thing a few times you&#x27;ll realize all those dumb 5 blade laser razors are a joke.</li>
    <li> 4 stars because I dropped it and it snapped at the screw.  Supposedly this is a common problem because they use cast steel.  It&#x27;s also not exactly the easiest to change blades.  The Merkur 34C is much easier to change blades, but it is a piece of junk.  If Edwin Jagger made something like the Merkur 34C, I would be in love.</li>
    <li> Love this razor. It has a great weight to assist in shaving. I have been using it for over two years with no problems yet.</li>
    <li> great craftsmanship and perfect weight.  Easy to use and clean.  Only razor I use now. Wasn&#x27;t a fan of the blades but great razor.</li>
    <li> A solid razor. The chrome finish on it is flawless and has a good heft.  The Derby blades in my opinion are good too.  I have purchased another to give to a family member as a gift.</li>
    <li> Good quality and first DE Razor.</li>
    <li> All I have to say is, awesome shave.</li>
    <li> Purchased Over 100 Replacement blades dirt cheap.....ONLY RAZOR I USE NOW, Until the day of my passing. Super Cost effective.</li>
    <li> Very nice razor. Great balance and feel. Quality shave. May buy another for my gym bag.</li>
    <li> Great finish, fantastic razor.</li>
    <li> After owning several safety razors this one is by far the most comfortable  and classy one to date .The weight of the razor and thickness of handle are perfect for me and make using it a pleasure. For the price I don&#x27;t think you can beat it.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging came as described and I would not hesitate using it as a gift presentation. The derby blades are also some of the best I have used .</li>
    <li> Great quality and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I have been using this razor for more than a year now and I absolutely love it. The quality is solid and the workmanship is immaculate.  I would say this razor gives me a close shave but at the same time, it is not very aggressive. This razor is a perfect start to the wonderful world of DE shaving!</li>
    <li> The first few times I tried shaving I got a few nicks but then I learned that the key to using one of these is to shave at the right angle. It takes some practice but if you a brain and figure it out you will get the best shave ever. Although its also extremely important to use the right kind of lubrication and the blade brand you use is also important. For me personally I have the best shave I have ever had using feather blades, this razor, and either noxema face cream(its made up of oils and a thickening agent that is like shaving cream so its actually the best thing ive tried surprisingly) or barbasol menthol version. Im sure theres better things than the barbasol but I&#x27;ve tried three versions of barbasol can and the menthol version I think is actually pretty good.</li>
    <li> Unless you have the facial hair of a women then please throw away the Derby 5 pack. Gives a sub-par shave. Don&#x27;t really know why E.J. would pair up with this company. Excellent Safety Razor, but it loses points for giving me crappy blades that ate my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other Reviewers are also correct on the slippery handle. I just try and keep my hand dry and so far have not dropped it. Have had the best results with [[ASIN:B0006M56BK Wilkinson Sword Double Edge single Razor Cartridge, 5 blades]]. One of the best shaves of my life.</li>
    <li> Better than i expected handle is not that short but then again everybody hands are different.</li>
    <li> Besides a great looking razor, the De89 performs amazing. There are loads of great reviews on this razor on the web, especially for beginners, and they are spot on. This was my first, and now after being fairly experienced in wet shaving, I have no need to try anything else. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s great for beginners and veterans alike. Weight and balance is perfect in my opinion, and I have no problems with grip. Gives a great shave, I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is something my 17yr. old wanted. He loves it and is hooked on a single-blade now.  He would recommend this product to anyone.  It takes a little getting used to but he is getting better at it.</li>
    <li> I had originally switched from a cartridge razor to a straight razor due to the amount of painful irritation I would get on my face, which would last all day, as well as the poor shave I got that required me to re-shave several times in order to meet uniform standards, which made my face even worse. The problem with the straight razor was that in order to not slice my throat, shaving took a very long time. While I preferred the straight razor over the cartridge, I didn&#x27;t always have that time in the mornings, so I found myself using the cartridge razor again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the safety razor. This razor has a solid weight at the head that requires you to put zero pressure in order to shave, (nor should you, heads up). With slow, short strokes, it glides across the skin, getting an incredibly close shave in the process. There is a learning curve, as you learn to stop putting pressure on the razor head, and to angle it so the razor is just barely touching your skin, but after a few days to a week the shave quality will be comparable to a professional straight razor shave in a barber shop. At the same time, you will find that your shave time has been reduced back down to nearly the same as when you were using a cartridge razor. All that for a better shave, with far less irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the learning period, you will slice yourself. Same as when you first learned to shave with the cartridge. Don&#x27;t be discouraged, you will learn quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Derby blades it comes with are good blades, but you may have to experiment with different blades to find the ideal one for your skin sensitivity and beard. I have very sensitive skin and a very thick beard, a terrible combination, and this combined with a simple moisturizing shaving soap bar and a drug store aftershave have completely eliminated my irritation. The good thing is the blades are cheap, especially compared to cartridge shaving, so this razor will shave you a lot of money in the long run. I was using Gillette Fusion cartridges before I got this... The difference in price between the replacement razors meant the safety razor paid for itself by my second pack of blades. Add in the savings with a long lasting shave soap vs the toxic canned stuff, and switching to safety razor wet shaving will put several more dollars in your wallet every month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the razor itself is resistant to rusting, so you don&#x27;t have to worry so much about that - Yet another big plus over my straight razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a very well crafted razor that combined with a decent shave soap, (I use the Van Der Hagen Deluxe soap, and got the Van Der Hagen Luxury Shave Set, all very cheap) and a proper wet shaving method will save you time, money, and irritation on your face. Definitely recommend for yourself, or as a gift.</li>
    <li> I purchased this probably a year ago and its still going strong.  I get a better shave then a multi bladed razor and at a very cheap price.  By small packs of razors and test what works best for you.  I didn&#x27;t like the derby razors, the Feathers and Astras worked best for me, the Feathers just slightly better but the Astras were cheaper and the performance difference was negligible.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone retro.  The cost of triple edge disposable razor blades is crazy.  So awhile back I switched to using a brush and shaving soap, which I&#x27;ve never regretted.  Now I&#x27;ve gone back to the traditional double edge safety razor.  I read many of the reviews on Amazon and it seemed to be that the top two safety razors were the Merkur and the Edwin Jagger with the Merkur seeming to have a slight edge.  But I first bought the Edwin Jagger because the reviews on the workmanship seemed to be better.  I was not disappointed.  It is a beautifully made product with a perfect chrome finish.  When I started using it everything was fine except the handle, for me felt a little short, and the razor is quite heavy 2.7oz/76grams versus the Merkur which weighs in at 2.1oz/61grams.  So I went ahead and then bought the Merkur.  The Merkur is also well made; just not quite as pretty.  The Merkur besides being lighter, also has a slightly longer handle, by perhaps a quarter inch, and the handle is smaller in diameter.  So for me, and my hand, the Merkur won the day.  I will say though that both razors with their respective blades will give you a very close, comfortable shave.  It all comes down to which one feels best in YOUR hand.  With either razor you&#x27;ll be getting your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> These were a superb price for a hundred blades. I have only had to use a couple of the blades.</li>
    <li> I have only used the safety razor for a short period now and I really enjoy the shave I get from it. I understand that this my be a subjective statement but I have no technical understanding to offer. Not knowing how to fully use the safety blade it has been difficult for me to shave around the chin and throat without cutting myself. After making a second pass however, the results are fantastic. I found the blade to be just aggressive enough for a beginner and I plan on using this hence forth. I do use an electric shaver to cover areas but I sense this will also stop once I get a handle for this shaver. I do suspect the chrome could have a problem if left in an environment that could cause such a result. The handle is also rather short for large hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Short handle&lt;br /&gt;-Learning curve&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 6-2014: The razor is fantastic and I am enjoying the shave I get from it every time I use it. I no longer cut myself but I still need a second pass because the blades included in the box are rather dull. I am currently on the hunt for better blades. The second pass does however produce the results I am looking for and so I stopped using an electric shaver long ago. The Nivea after shave helps with an irritation from my missteps while learning the techniques. I do dip the razor in hot water and rub down the chrome because the soap builds on the surface/blade if not cleared properly after each use which is where I do wish I had a proper stand for this. Currently I use off the shelf shaving gel and have no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Between an electric rotary shaver, cartridge razor, and this DE safety this one gave me the best results by far and am very satisfied with the purchase. Score remains at 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Not exactly travel friendly</li>
    <li> The razor is made well and has a balance feel to it. It is forgiving for new shavers but provides an excellent shave for the more experienced.</li>
    <li> One side of the razor shaves closer than the other, as if the head is a little off. Otherwise it would be five stars.</li>
    <li> I attend a college that requires men to be well-groomed/clean shaven and dressed in business casual attire. At first I bought the Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler Razor, but my facial hair is the consistency of steel wool and as my wallet grew thinner I would try to extend the life of the razor (whose cartridges I had to take out extra loans to pay for) and the blades dulled, my face suffered, and I looked for something new. I bought a Phillips Norelco YS524, which was great for styling beards, but after weeks of use, still left my face patchy and irritated and didn&#x27;t seem to reduce the time of shaving at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then looked into wet-shaving, read some blogs, articles, and youtube videos and took the plunge. There is a small learning curve, and getting good at using these razors takes practice, but what a difference it makes! I recommend getting a badger-hair shaving brush and either shaving soap or shaving cream you have to lather in a bowl before using this. I use Proroso shaving cream and an Escala brush, and it makes the experience more enjoyable. I didn&#x27;t use the Derby blades that came with it, but I ordered the Astra 100-pack blades for $10 because they are sharper, and this is the smoothest shave I have ever gotten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a beginner (like me) getting into wet shaving this or the Merkur 34C are great introductory razors that aren&#x27;t very expensive. This one is very streamlined and by far the shiniest object I own. If you are concerned that the grip looks slippery from the picture-- it isn&#x27;t and I haven&#x27;t dropped it yet. The craftsmanship on this razor is impeccable, and from the time you take it out of the box, until the time you complete your first shave, you will be more than satisfied with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mathematically speaking, switching from a Gillete Fusion (or other razor) to a razor like this should be cheaper within half a year, and you can afford to change razor blades (10 cents a piece) as often as you like. Beyondthat, this razor has given me a testosterone boost and a hobby that I truly enjoy waking up in the morning to.</li>
    <li> Beautiful classic razor. This is my first safety razor and I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long. Most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever had with no razor burn or cuts after 2 weeks. No need to worry about a proper technique. Just pick it up and start shaving. Almost look forward to shaving now!</li>
    <li> This is my first DE razor, and I am very much enjoying the experience.  I can&#x27;t really comment about how it compares to other DE razors, but I really like the styling of the chrome, and the razor seems to have good balance and weight and is comfortable to hold  &amp;#34;forehand&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;backhand&amp;#34; for each side of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The textured handle provides decent grip, even when wet, and the three-piece assembly is smooth and easy to put together.  There is some play in the posts with certain blades, but I am not sure if this is a tolerance issue with the blades of the razor itself.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to impact the quality of the shave though.  The chrome feels fantastic against my face, and provides very good feedback with each stroke.  I can tell how smooth my face is just by how easily the chrome plating glides through the lather.</li>
    <li> Never before have I used a real razor except for the cheap disposable name brands. I decided after all of these years to go back in time when my grandfather was alive and try shaving like they did back then. Always had fond memories of him shaving with a blade and brush and putting this rich lather on his face... It was a everyday ritual for him. Did some research on some sites devoted to shaving etc... saw Edwin Jagger and loved this razor. Love the detail and craftsmanship and the history behind this company. (if they been around for a few hundred years than they have to be good).  I have never had a closer shave before in my life. Yes, there is a little bit of a learning curve and yes I did get a nick here and there.... But those were rookie mistakes. I understand there are different types of blades etc... And I plan on getting a blade sample pack to try and find which blades work best. I will never go back to plastic disposables again. Just like the 3 bears states, not to big, and not to small, it is just right!  ( my version ). Oh... Get some glycerin shave soap if you are new to safety razors... I got some Van Der Hagen and works great and at a good price too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10-20-2012 : So far so good.... I really enjoy this safety razor. I got a great deal on blades that should last me a long time. I actually save money by not purchasing those throw away disposables. The weight and feel and the textured handle really helps keep a good steady grip. I suggest you get a good boar shaving brush to lather with and glycerin shaving soap and it will be the closest shave you will ever have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1-2-2013 Well..... It finally happened. I dropped it and the head of the razor snapped off. I know it is totally my fault but I was shaving in the shower and dropped it. Dropped it about 4-5 times before it finally broke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review of the Merkur 180 HD and why I prefer the EJ...&lt;br /&gt;I got this to replace the Edwin Jagger DE89Lbl ( 9 is the model year). I have dropped it in the shower a few times (totally my fault) and the head broke off. So I decided that I would try another brand just to see if there is a big difference. Well the Merkur arrived and I have shaved with it twice and it gives a pretty decent shave and the handle is slightly larger with a buckwheat etched handle with a good feel so it doesn&#x27;t slip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me I prefer the Edwin Jagger DE89BA11 Double Edge Safety Razor, Barley Chrome (the 2011 model). In researching the many DE razors out on the market, they also have models that have been updated hence the DE89BA11 because it was updated in 2011 with a slightly different weight distribution in the handle. So the 1st EJ that I bought was a older model DE89Lbl which is a 2009 model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately this info is not always in the product info and when trying to replace the EJ all they have on Amazon is the 09 model year and not the 2011. I had to go out of the Amazon sphere which I found several sites that do have the most current model and was actually a few bucks cheaper. As much as I love Amazon, you still have to do your research.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok... now for the reason I prefer the EJ razor over the Merkur.... the quality and the finish of the EJ is far superior. The chrome is brilliant, and not one flaw on the chrome of the EJ. The Merkur was lighter, but had many blemishes and just not as elegant in my opinion. Yes the Merkur is good, but I cant wait to get my Edwin Jagger DE89BA11 Double Edge Safety Razor, Barley Chrome (the 2011 model) soon. I will use the Merkur as a back up and possibly use to travel with so in case I loose it I still have my Edwin Jagger.ped it in the shower a few times (totally my fault) and the head broke off.

    <li> After researching DE razors for a while, I decided to buy the Edwin Jagger over the more popular Merkur.&lt;br /&gt;The choice was mainly due to the price of the EJ being lower than Merkur, and EJ came with it&#x27;s own good set of reviews by users.  So, for someone who had not used a DE razor before, shelling out extra for a more expensive razor did not make sense to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Razor:&lt;br /&gt;The razor by itself is almost great.  Great chrome finish, nice heft, and great shave.&lt;br /&gt;I say &#x27;almost&#x27;, because, I cannot, for the life of me, understand, why would razor companies manufacture a device that has the potential to maim one&#x27;s face, with a slippery handle!&lt;br /&gt;This is not an Edwin Jagger problem.  I see lots of other razors with popular models do the same - Chrome finish for the handles, with nary a ridge available to provide grip.  (Is it to keep the cost down?  I dont know. )&lt;br /&gt;In any case, I bought the model that had ridge lines to provide whatever little grip it can provide.&lt;br /&gt;Other than the constant slipping issue and how careful I need to be so as not to have a deep nick on my jaw, I am thoroughly pleased with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Derby Blades:&lt;br /&gt;This purchase came with free 5 Derby blades, and I am so thankful they decided to ship them free to be tried out.&lt;br /&gt;After using it, I realized that I will never buy a Derby blade again.&lt;br /&gt;It is very rough on my skin, and doesn&#x27;t feel sharp enough.  Worse still, it seems to lose it&#x27;s edge much sooner than I would like, and I only have an average growth.&lt;br /&gt;I also am aware that these blades are pretty cheap, and has worked well for a lot of people, but it is not for me. I dont mind paying some extra cash for the blades as long as my chin and jaw are not left with a burning sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s - I&#x27;ve noticed that, Wilkinson blades are awesome, and I intend to use them once I go through a whole set of 7 O&#x27;Clock blades that I had shipped from India.  The 7 O&#x27;Clock blades are not bad. They last longerthan the Derby&#x27;s for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving Technique:&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed when I shaved with this razor, is how forgiving the Gillete Mach 3 or razors of it&#x27;s ilk are.&lt;br /&gt;You cannot use the same strokes and methods that you did with your Gillettes or Schicks when you are using a DE razor.&lt;br /&gt;You have to use very short strokes, and you should NOT press into your skin.  You can stretch your skin using your other hand, and gently glide the DE razor in short strokes.  Go with the grain and not against it.&lt;br /&gt;Once you are done, do an encore, even though you think you look &#x27;clean shaven&#x27;.  You will not regret it.&lt;br /&gt;After the second shave, you will look shaven in a way you probably haven&#x27;t seen yourself, if you used a Mach 3 or whatever.  (I spend the extra time on the weekends with an &#x27;encore&#x27;, to score brownie points with the missus, who absolutely loves it!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with Edwin Jagger, and once I grow out of this/lose it/break it, I&#x27;ll look for an Edwin Jagger that has a good grip on it&#x27;s handle.</li>
    <li> One reviewer mentioned to go with a less aggressive cheap razor, I should have listened. This takes some time to learn.</li>
    <li> This is my first Safety Razor and I have no negatives to say about this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 6&#x27; tall with large hands and have no problem with the length of the handle or loosing my grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am able to get a close shave without cutting myself (at least not very often) and have no problem getting the hairs under my nose (I had read complaints with other razors that larger heads make this an issue).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to be simple and well built enough to not fall apart over time.  Time will tell if the chrome plating has any issues with the environment in my bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have mentioned, it looks and feels great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 year update: no signs of the chrome plating coming loose so far.  Still no complaints.  I have used it every day, replacing the blade once a week and it is still looks like new.</li>
    <li> It is a great piece. It is little piece of Jewel. I mean it.. the finish and Feel is great. I had a breezing experience buying it from Amazon. I will surely give 5 stars to this..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll never use a cartridge razor again. This product convinced me after the first use. My skin is sensitive so I easily get razor burn and ingrown hairs, but that&#x27;s a thing of the past.</li>
    <li> I really like this DE safety razor. This is the first time I&#x27;ve used one. I did some research and chose the one I thought had the most favorable reviews. It fits nicely in my hand and is just the right weight. If you&#x27;re new to DE shaving, take it slow and just let the weight of the razor against your face do the job. It takes a bit longer to shave in the morning, but it does a great job. Just like a &amp;#34;shop shave&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I received it promptly. The quality is very good. The only problem I have is, while tightening it is gets stuck every time and I need to unscrew it and tighten it again. It is a very good quality Razor.</li>
    <li> My first DE razor was a butterfly model being pedaled by a certain TV celeb.  It was OK.  The butterfly mechanism started to feel stiff and had mineral deposits that were too bothersome to clean and was not a pleasure to use.  After some research, I decided on the  EJ DE89Lbl, mainly because of a Youtube video showing the flawless chrome finish and simplicity.  I was not disappointed.  The deep chrome finish is jewel-like and cleans in a heartbeat.  In retrospect, I would choose a different handle for a more secure grip.  The longitudinal striations on the barrel might feel a little slippery to some.  The weight is perfect, no pressing with this razor.  With the supplied Derby blade and Cremo Creme, my shave was quick, painless and I&#x27;m not sure 3X the money would get me any closer to a perfect shave with my med-heavy beard.  Learning more as I go, cleaning and drying is mandatory after use and ensures an as-new experience every shave.  One thing I never see mentioned in these reviews is shaving in the shower.  Buy a fog-free mirror and shave just prior to exiting the shower.  Your stubble is clean and soft and affords you the best opportunity for a great shave.  My only nit-pic is no box! Even a cheap cardboard one will protect the razor when traveling.</li>
    <li> It is now a pleasure to shave because of this razor.  Chrome is great, shave is close and unmatched by cartridge razors.  I will never go back.</li>
    <li> This razor is awesome and will last a lifetime. Gives a great close shave. Pair it with some persona blades. Throw away the Derbys that it comes with.</li>
    <li> Got this after much research (shout out to Badger and Blade - Thanks guys!) as I wanted a quality piece that I will be able to use and keep for years. I have large hands, so the slightly longer handle vs the Merkur HD was ideal, plus judging from the reviews, this is an all round better razor (though not by much). That being said, it was smaller than I thought it would be, but really is the perfect size for the job and I have never cut myself. It has also never slipped when wet, and I could only see this being a problem if you get soap/cream all over your hands if you don&#x27;t use a brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are switching to DE to save money, spend a little more on the razor, get it right the first time, and for under $40 you can&#x27;t go wrong (when I bought it is was pennies over $30)! Hopefully it will stand the test of time, but judging by the built quality I am very confident it will!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a starter kit then I would recommend piecing together your own, this is what I purchased, and I am very happy with it, costing ~$75&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taylor of Old Bond Street Shaving Cream: Sandalwood - Top quality.

Stands can look nice, but aren&#x27;t really necessary)</li>
    <li> I am stunned by the incredible difference in shave quality with a double edge safety razor v. disposable razors, e.g., Mach, Fusion, et al.  Very much regret not switching over years ago.  And way, WAY cheaper.  I bought 100 Shark blades for $12.00.  Each blade gives about 5 good shaves.  Do the math gentlemen.  BTW, very easy to shave, no nicks or cuts from very first shave. Almost no stubble even after 24 hours.</li>
    <li> I am really glad I made this purchase.  It worked well the first run, and I agree it was a much closer shave than I have had.  I bought the parraso shaving soap that comes up as a suggestion and used a old shaving brush I&#x27;d inherited from my Grandfather.  I am really pleased with the simplicity of the setup.  I&#x27;d been putting a couple drops of baby oil on my cartridge razors and extended their life for weeks doing that, albeit with a much inferior shave to this EJ.  So I&#x27;m doing the same with this to see what happens.. taking it apart drying the blade a little and putting  a line of oil on the blade. The blades are so cheap, and the experience with a fresh one so pleasant I may abandon that ritual though.&lt;br /&gt;I am really glad I made the switch-- at least as an option when I want to do a special shave that has a bit more care and art involved in it.  Kind of a meditation, I can tell compared to what I was doing with cartridge razors in the shower.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll use this one in the shower as I think seeing how you are stretching skin is important to avoiding nicks.</li>
    <li> Excellent razor. Comfortable to grip with an extremely close shave using Badger hair brush and C. O. Bigelow shave cream. I would recommend this to any one looking to improve their shave and get away from the expensive money stealing modern razor.</li>
    <li> I just used this in my first DE ahave and it&#x27;s great. I got a very close shave, and was easy to use and assemble. Would reccomend this to anyone who wanted to shave with a safety razor. Forget those multi cartridge razors</li>
    <li> I had a Merkur razor my son confiscated from me, so I ordered the Edwin Jagger as a replacement so we could tell who&#x27;s razor is who&#x27;s. I had no issues with the Merkur and I have no issue with the Edwin Jagger, both are high quality products. I will say buy either product and enjoy safety razor shaving.</li>
    <li> Gave it as a gift to my son and he loves it nice to see a 20 year old enjoy something like this</li>
    <li> This razor gives a really great shave. The quality of the materials and workmanship is high and looks amazing. The price of this razor is lower than most high quality razors, and given the quality of this razor, is a tremendous value.</li>
    <li> Purchased the De89lbl double edge razor.  Chrome plating is beautiful.  Razor has good weight and feel.  Easy to change blades.  This razor will be used a very long time.</li>
    <li> This shaver for the money is the best, it has a very nice finish and glides across my face like a race car on a race track.</li>
    <li> You can never go wrong with an Edwin Jagger double edged safety razor and this razor is no exception. A great shave and a good looking razor.</li>
    <li> This is my first DE razor but I am very happy with it. It is high quality and works great.</li>
    <li> The only thing I would Chang if I could is the handle is a little short.  Otherwise it shaves great and it&#x27;s nice and heavy.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor. It has a nice weight to it. All you have to do is let the weight of the razor do the cutting. It comes with 5 Derby razor blades but I recently ordered the Gillette Silver Blue blades. The Gillette blades are much better and last longer. Being that I&#x27;m just a novice at this, the Gillette blades didn&#x27;t give me any nicks like the Derby blades. Overall, this is a great buy.</li>
    <li> This is my first DE razor. I cannot say enough how glad I bought it. I was torn between it and a Merkur 34C. Glad I got this one. Not aggressive. It does what you ask it to do. Using Derby blades. They are okay. I am hooked to DE because of this razor.</li>
    <li> I am a beginner to DE razor shaving, and this was my first razor. Needless to say, it was an easy and refreshing experience !&lt;br /&gt;The well balanced and medium lengthed handle gave exceptionalmaneuverability and as a result, I suffered no cuts from shaving. The blade cuts cleanly at a good length creating an enjoyable, shaving experience!</li>
    <li> Great shave at a good price. I was tired of buying refills for a triple track that clogged for twenty-five bucks, so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try. I bought this razor and 50 Feather double edge blades. The razor and the blades work great!</li>
    <li> came fast and its my first DE shaver.  had one when i was young but never appreciated it then.  now i do and i am pleased to have made this purchase</li>
    <li> have been de shaving fo a long time and this is on of the best and most beautiful that I owen.</li>
    <li> At 56 years of age, I have had it with the ever increasing cost of a simple shave.  After much research, I decided to switch to a double edge razor and chose the Edwin Jagger DE89Lbl razor.  I can not properly describe how surprised I was at the incredible shave the very first time I used it.  In the several days since, my shave has gotten better and smoother. I have not had any nicks or burns, my face feels like a new borns butt, and, the first time I used it, my wife said I looked great and wanted to know what I had done differently!  On my word of honor, this is the best shaving experience of my life.  When you couple that with the low cost per shave and the, believe it or not, feeling of stepping back in time and doing it like my father, well, I would have been a fool to not switch over.  The Edwin Jagger is heavy enough to just lay on your skin and let it do the work.  It is solid, beautiful, and a pleasure to use.  Treat yourself and purchase one today!</li>
    <li> Got one each for my father and brothers. My father had used safety razors before of course and brothers hadnt. All three are now using the safety razor instead of pricey disposables. Father said it seemed high quality ang recognized that the English in Sheffield had a history of producing quality things. Brothers cut themselves up a little until they learned it&#x27;s not a disposable and learned the proper angle and pressure. The ONLY difficulty I&#x27;ve had with mine is that the head screw is a little hard to line up properly and I&#x27;m worried about misaligning and chewing up the threads. Besides that, I keep mine in the shower and use it everyday.  Edit: So 18 months have passed. I must say, I have been disappointed. I dropped mine in the shower and the head screw snapped off. Then my father called literally 2 weeks later and said he&#x27;d dropped his onto the bath floor rug and his head screw snapped too. Why it the head screw so brittle? They must expect folks to drop them from time to time. Fortunately, I drilled through the top and screwed in a #10 x 32 machine screw and fixed it right up. But it&#x27;s still silly that it broke in the first place. Downgraded a star.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave my face for me would be the only real complaint I have</li>
    <li> This is a beautifully crafted, highly polished razor.  I decided to jump ship on the multi-blade razors and go back to what I watched my father shave with as a boy.  Unfortunately, my soft skin and medium to medium-light whiskers are no match for this razor.  After about a month of frustration and almost returning to the 5-blade world, I started to research and ended up buying a refurbished Gillette Black Beauty (1976) on E-bay.  OMG I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference.  No nicks, cuts or abrasions that I received with this razor!  I enjoy shaving with this oldie but goodie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, I&#x27;m sure this is a great razor for those of us with heavy beards and tough skin.  I would not recommend this as a first DE shaver.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful razor and it gives a very good shave to boot. The blades are a fraction of the cost of cartridges. Definitely a worthwhile purchase.</li>
    <li> This is my 1st ever double edge razor. I did a lot of research and am very happy with my choice. I can see me getting a more aggressive razor as I get better.</li>
    <li> Wow is this a nice double edge razor.  This razor is so nice that they should outlaw the old double edge razors that your fathers and grandfathers used.  I wasn&#x27;t sure that I would like this razor but wanted to try one to see if it would do as well as these over rated over priced multi-bladed pieces of plastic junk.  Ok, I love this.  My first shave with this razor was awesome as every shave that I&#x27;ve had after the first.  And this is with the blades that were sent with the razor (Derby razors).  This is a well built razor that is heavy enough but not too heavy to feel nice in your hand.  Good control with this.  You can tell this is a quality piece just as soon as you open the box and unwrap it.  I also understand that the razor you will use for the type beard you have will also make a difference in your shave you get, so choose the right blade through trial and error.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Rok H.</li>
    <li> I purchased these for my husband and son in law who are constantly lamenting the expense of the newer style of razor. They were both so pleased with the results of this product. They wondered why they hadn&#x27;t thought of going this route before.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product awhile back and almost gave up on it becasue my neck would get very bothered and cut up. It took me a solid 3 months to adjust to it but now that I have, it works like a charm. Gives a close shave with blades at $10 for a 100 pack (astra).  Just have to be careful and give it a break in period.</li>
    <li> I read an article on how great these razors are and figured i would give it a try. This specific razor is of high quality. You get what you pay for. This is manufactured in Britain rather than a Chinese sweat shop and it shows. I couldnt be happier. You dont need any fancy brush or creams to use, soap or lotion will do, although i hear great things about brush. There was no learning curve for me. I am 32 and have been shaving with a disposable razors since i was 14. If you dont know what a razor should feel like on your skin then be careful to not put pressure on the head and be gentle around the nose. It does take me longer to shave near nose than disposable. This razor shaves closer and is more gentle on the skin than a disposable. Based on the feeling i can see how too many passes could irritate the skin and could see how carelessness could cause nicks. I walked away with NO nicks the first time and still have not been nicked. It is also WAY cheaper in the long run vs. disposable.</li>
    <li> I knew I wanted to delve into DE shaving, but before buying I borrowed my grandfather&#x27;s 1953 Gillette SuperSpeed. While not the closest shave, it did the trick when paired with some Astra Superglides. The age and condition of the Gilette may have contributed to that as well as the relative dullness of the Astra blades. Knowing this, I jumped in and finally bought the Edwin Jagger after doing months of research. Took a couple of shaves to figure out the angle I needed, but I absolutely love this razor. My only complaint is that it can get a little slippery when your hands are covered in soap. I&#x27;m waiting for my Feather blades to arrive to see how close of a shave I can get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I want to say to anybody that is considering the switch to DE Shaving. It&#x27;s your face! Your face and the guy&#x27;s in the video may be completely different. You may have to go through some trial and error to find a shaving setup/process that works for your face/skin/beard. I personally cannot use any sort of cream to shave with. I can also shave against the grain with no issues. Learn your own face.</li>
    <li> Thanks to the extremely high costs of Gillette blades for Mach 3 and Quattro I decided to go back to a double edged razor.  It&#x27;s been decades since I used a double edge and I was a bit apprehensive so I figured rather than return to a cheap model like I used before, why not choose one with a good rating for quality.  When it arrived I was a slightly taken aback by the handle being slightly shorter than I was expecting but after a couple of shaves I adjusted so that wasn&#x27;t a problem.  The feel is solid and with the included Derby blades the shave was smooth as silk, albeit with a few nicks the first few times.  I&#x27;d forgotten what a truly close shave felt like, even the Quattro can&#x27;t compare to this!  The De89lbl feels and looks great and to say I&#x27;m happy is an understatement.  Since I haven&#x27;t used a DE razor in about 20 years I can&#x27;t compare this to other current models, but I can say I&#x27;m happy enough with this one that if I decide to buy another razor for use in another bathroom, it will be an Edwin Jagger for sure.</li>
    <li> I rarely write a reviews on my purchases in Amazon.  Honestly I usually write them if I find issues.  However I am making an exception.  This is really geared more to those new to safety razors as I am.  I purchased this razor, put it together and used it right away.  My first week of shaving experiences was terrible, why,  because I set the razor up wrong.  I set it up backwards and it simply wasn&#x27;t working at all.  I want to emphasize how important it is to set your razor up correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I set it up correctly, it worked significantly better.  I personally wanted sharper blades that what came it the razor, but this is a personal preference.  Overall I am incredibly happy, because this cheaper than any other shaving option and I am getting a better shave than I did with my five blade cartridge Gillette Fusion.  The blades on the safety razor also last longer as an added bonus.  I can not emphasize how much better overall the safety razor option is and this particular razor receives high marks from me and many others, not only here but on shaving sites as well.</li>
    <li> Produces a good shave with limitations:  the handle is too short to grip comfortably. The vertical ridges on the handle are very slippery and have caused me to cut myself numerous times.</li>
    <li> I purchased two of these razors, and both broke at the same weak point. The first one was dropped in the sink because the handle was too slick with shaving soap on it. It broke right below the head where the handle attaches. I replaced the razor and purchased a Weber Stainless Steel Bulldog Handle for the second one. This morning upon changing the blade and snugging down the handle, the post broke off in exactly the same spot as the first one. There was no trauma as in the first one, so the razor is either defective or these things are made to break with minimal usage. I will NOT be purchasing from this company again, and am going to a straight razor. I gave two stars because while it worked, it was a pretty decent razor. I would caution anyone considering purchasing this razor, as Edwin Jagger quality control seems to be lacking.</li>
    <li> Close shave razor. Easy to use. Used with pre shave and was suprised how close the shave was. Blades last longer then typical throw away.</li>
    <li> I just returned to safety razor shaving after a several decade journey through electrics and the various multiple edge &amp;#34;gimmick&amp;#34; razors.  My memory is perhaps a bit fuzzy, but this razor is better than the old ones I had so long ago and far better than the electrics, the Mach 3s, the Fusions, the Hydros, etc.  It has a great weight, and the pattern on the handle makes it easy to hold even if your hands are wet. Once again I get a baby-smooth shave, and at nearly 70 I didn&#x27;t think I would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One tip: I tried some of the special shaving soaps with this razor and found I didn&#x27;t need them.  A basic shaving gel works great for me and is much, much cheaper.  That coupled with the low cost of blades means that shaving is truly inexpensive for me now.</li>
    <li> Just switched to a double-edged razor and this one is a beautiful one to start with. It&#x27;s heavy, but comfortable in your hands, and looks like it will hold up for some time. I won&#x27;t go back to the gimmicky world of Gillette and Schick any time soon! (Note that you may have to spend some time finding the blades that work just right for you. The Derby blades that came with this razor worked pretty well for me.)</li>
    <li> Just recieved this razor in the last two weeks, and i have shaved with it about 3 times. The razor functions and look fantastic. My only complaint would be the handle is a bit short compared to modern razors, and for a big handed guy like me a long handled Merker may have been a slightly better choice. A minor quibble.</li>
    <li> I use this razor everyday, and it&#x27;s so many times better than cartridge razors it&#x27;s unbelievable to me they ever took over the market. It&#x27;s a closer shave, it&#x27;s more percise, and it is much easier on your face. I use to have problems on my neck with irritation and razor bumps. Now as long as I take my time, and go gentle (a new concept after using a cartridge!) the neck is done and looks fresh.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with my EJ De89. The finish is wonderful, the heft really feels good in the hand while shaving, and it&#x27;s been good to me in terms of shaves so far with just over a month of use. Easy to take apart and put back together, even though this is my first de razor. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Have been using at 1962 Gillette Adjustable Slim and was concerned that this wasn&#x27;t adjustable, but this isn&#x27;t an issue at all, as the razor is perfect as is. I am very pleased with the shave I get from this razor. It&#x27;s very cool to look at too--very shiny and beautifully designed. Recommended very highly.</li>
    <li> This is a nice razor. It looks and performs rather nicely. I would recomend this razor to anybody that has a fair to average hair growth. For me it is not agressive enough for my beard.  te razor blades for me is not sharp enough and gave me some razor burn. If you purchase a different blade you will see great results with practice.</li>
    <li> This is my first DE Razor and I am in love with shaving now, it&#x27;s almost like a new hobby. This razor has a very nice weight to it, and feels like really good quality. The derby blades that came with this SUCKED, or at least didnt work for me at all. I threw in an Astra blade and my shaves have been absolutely amazing.</li>
    <li> I was staying few days in my son townhome and I dont have my disposable razor , he lend me this Edwin De89lbll and I was so delighted that the feeling and performance was delightful that I got my laptop and ordered right away and next2-3 days I received it from Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is my very first Double Edge Razor and I got to say that I love this thing. It does get a little used to it but you learn real quick.&lt;br /&gt;Its easy to put together and take apart, it has a decent amount of weight but not to heavy.&lt;br /&gt;The blades are fair price so you&#x27;ll save money buy using this. I have to say that there&#x27;s nothing like using a DE Razor.</li>
    <li> This razor is incredibly well made.  I have a Merkur long handle razor, which, while good, still does&lt;br /&gt;not equal the craftsmanship on this razor. So it bends the blade ever so slightly to get just the&lt;br /&gt;right angle for a great shave.  An excellent blade in this razor like the Feather or the Bic yields&lt;br /&gt;amazing results.  My face feels like butter and remains smooth late into the evening. Do yourself&lt;br /&gt;a favor and get one.</li>
    <li> Simply the best.  I am an African-American man, and with that being said,  it has been a very difficult journey trying to find a good razor that works for me.  This razor works for African-American men too, mission accomplished.</li>
    <li> I got tired of paying so much money for razor cartridges that almost always left my face irritated, nicked or with ingrown hairs.  After reading about safety razors and watching YouTube videos on the subject, I thought I would give it a try.  I&#x27;m glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is absolutely beautiful and has a nice, solid feel.  The chrome finish is flawless and is not too slippery if it gets wet. The head is heavy and does most of the work.  You don&#x27;t need to apply much pressure to your face at all and you&#x27;ll get a nice close shave.  It takes a little getting used to, though.  It&#x27;s a different feel than from the light-weight plastic disposables.  Don&#x27;t be in a hurry when you use this razor.  Take your time and the results will be worth it.  Less irritation and a closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor came with 5 Derby blades.  Since this is my first safety razor I cannot compare them to others.  However, they do give me a great shave. I will try others to see what they are like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can see why this razor got so many great reviews.  It is a well-made razor that should last for many years.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This excellent tool from Edwin Jagger has met all my standards for a shaver. The blades are sharp, it looks great and shaves as close as a straight razor.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas last two years ago.  He got a decent shave with it.  The head snapped off after 1 year of use.  He meticulously cared for it.  It didn&#x27;t even get dropped.  I had high hopes for this since the reviews were great.  Will probably get him a Merkur next time.</li>
    <li> I am new to de razor shaving . But I have found out this is the way to shave. I have the edwin jagger de89lbl the only thing I dont like is handle. But the shave is great. But I am still learning. I have ordered a bulldog handle will see how that goes. But as for the switch to de shaving best thing I could have done . And I would highly recomend the edwin jagger de89lbl but with different handle</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to DE shaving and this razor has a great feel to it for me.  It&#x27;s got great weight to it and is a well constructed razor.  It does have a shorter handle which takes minimal time to get used to.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve now had this almost a month and it&#x27;s my favorite purchase in recent memory. Being half Irish I have been cursed with extremely sensitive skin. Shaving had always been a chore I hated because I was using the latest 5 bladed contraption that left me in pain after using it. So after doing some research I settled on this DE with a sampler pack of blades, some proraso soap and a badger brush. It took me a few shaves to get a feel for it, and I&#x27;ll be honest there was some cuts in the very beginning. Even with those nicks the feeling was heads and tails above what I had been using. I&#x27;ve settled on Astra SP blades as my favorite of the ones I&#x27;ve tried so far. I was surprised just how much of a difference there is between blades. I had heard great things about Derby, but as they say your mileage may vary. I found Derby too dull for my liking. I&#x27;m going to try feather blades next, though I will stock up on Astra SP as my everyday blade. I now look forward to shaving and rarely skip a day. After a month my technique has improved to where nicks and cuts don&#x27;t happen even on a 3 pass shave.</li>
    <li> this was a wonderful purchase. the recipient uses it often and I anticipate it lasting for decades.</li>
    <li> This safety razor will last you a lifetime and then you can pass it on to your first born.  The chrome finish makes it easy to clean, but I recommend a leather case to protect it from scratches.  The Derby razor blades work perfectly with this razor and you can buy a 100ct pack for about $8.  I&#x27;ll never buy another brand of razor for my face.</li>
    <li> I have refused to purchase Gillette Fusion replacement blades because of the high price.  The JAGGER IS OUTSTANDING.</li>
    <li> Well, the head of my razor broke off today.  Used this razor between once a week and once every other week.  Purchased in 2011, lasted 4 years. Was happy while it lasted but really dont think it should have broken so easily.  On the hunt for another razor now, will not be going with Edwin Jagger this time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for at least 6 months now; it&#x27;s one of the better things I&#x27;ve purchased on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The chrome is high quality (zero scratches so far), easy to clean (and stays clean), and the overall feel of the razor is SUPERB. I&#x27;ll probably have this thing for the rest of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving is a lot cheaper buying double edge blades as opposed to having to spend $20 for fusion blades every few months.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor about 3 months ago (now Sep 2012). The Edwin Jagger (EJ) De89lbl Double Edge Safety Razor has worked great for me and the best part about it is the extremely low cost of replacement razors (bought on Amazon).  I will say that it would be nice for the handle to be a little longer (the Merkur&#x27;s handle is about a half inch longer), the EJ however is heavier which I like and the finish looks great.  I read some reviews that it is slippery, but I haven&#x27;t noticed that at all.  Overall this is a great product and I would and have recommended a friend to buy one.</li>
    <li> Hubby loves it.  Really close shave and no nicks</li>
    <li> I also have the Merkur long handle. But this one by Edwin Jagger is much nicer/higher quality.  The chrome is excellent. The shave is a little more forgiving than the Merkur.  Aside from the handle .. When I hold both side by side they are almost exactly alike maybe even interchangeable head parts... So I think the fact that the shave isn&#x27;t as rough may be due to the EJ having a slightly smaller space between the bar and blade. If holding the two in your hands .... I think 9 of 10 guys would buy the Edwin Jagger. It&#x27;s a good gift idea for someone who can appreciate fine craftsmanship.</li>
    <li> DITTO all the other 5-Star ratings...and their observations...with the addition of this:&lt;br /&gt;For the longest time I used, and hated using, the plastic, throw away shaving-toys. Why?, &#x27;cause of their easily getting fouled-up with the residue of the whisker-whacking process...the hair &amp; lather. And then, so often, I wasn&#x27;t able to dislodge this gunk by shaking the device in the sink. I found that I was forced to use an old tooth brush to clean it...before using it again.  WELL!, that inconvenience is now but a faded memory...Ta-Da!...as this beauty has a wide enough gap to prevent said problem.</li>
    <li> For around thirty dollah, you can own the absolute best and cleanest razor in the world. It really does make you feel like more of a man when you set aside five or ten minutes a day to shave, which, up until I owned this remarkable razor, I really hated. Shaving with a flimsy plastic two to five edged piece of crap disposable razor is just not pleasurable. It&#x27;s work, it feels totally second (or third, or fourth) class, and about the only consistent experience is that at least one part of your face or neck will feel burned or irritated, especially when you (for some ungodly reason) decide to \\&quot;brace\\&quot; your face skin by slapping the crap out of your cheeks with some mentholated liquid alcohol that is actually flammable. Shaving sucks, man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until you decide to put in the effort and research and plunk down three ten dollar bills on this polished tank of beautiful function. It&#x27;s shiny, engraved, fluted, and feels like you&#x27;re holding the holy grail of razors when you heft it. And, actually, you are. It&#x27;s solid and perfectly balanced. It&#x27;s the difference between holding a stamped chef&#x27;s \\&quot;knife\\&quot; bought at Wal Mart and holding a full tang, forged J.A. Henckel. You never want to cut with anything else. For the price of this razor...which WILL last you a lifetime and then some...you could MAYBE get a superduper lubrication strip brandishing store-bought plastic five edged NIGHTMARE with five refill cartridges that will only make you sad and, depending on your prowess, leave your face bloody. Yes, your face; the only part of your body that is generally seen by everyone, every day, in all it&#x27;s unclothed glory. I bought a 100 pack of assorted double edged razor blades for around twenty dollah so I can narrow down even further the best combination for my skin. These blades are, obviously, double edged. The razor is beautifully crafted with exacting dimensions so the blade is curved into the perfect angle for shaving. It usually requires one stroke to cleave off every single whisker unbeLIEVABLY close to your skin with a fresh blade without a single spot of redness or chafing. Do you enjoy trying to clean cut whiskers from in between the multiple blades of your supermarket plastic beauty? Takes a car wash wand to unclog those. With this razor, a couple of twists to the handle actually opens and exposes the entire edge, without touching it or taking it out or manipulating it in any way. Hold it under the tiniest stream of water and EVERYTHING is washed away lickety split. Longer hair, short, thick whiskers, soap, and deposits wash away instantly. Re-tighten the handle and keep shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every man, truly, should indulge themselves with this. And go the extra mile and get a cream brush and old fashioned shaving soap. A perfectly hot, thick lather pushed up each whisker and even into the follicles make the razor glide through softened beards like a lubricated barbershop dream. And new double edged safety razors are available in every grocery store and drugstore in my area, and they are MUCH cheaper than those asinine replacement lubed cartridge pieces of crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You really can afford to own the absolute best of something. This is it.</li>
    <li> This is my first safety razor and I can&#x27;t imagine it gets better.  To start off, it fells like a man&#x27;s razor.  Heavy, Chrome, Beautiful but not girly.  It&#x27;s a piece of machinery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 31 and have only known the Gillete Razors over the years.  Once I started researching shaving and moustaches, I found the ArtofManliness.com.  Read the articles and reviews and got the bug to use a real razor.  So...I did some searching and found BadgerandBlade.com and theshavenook.com.  All helped me to reach the decision to buy the Edwin Jagger De89lbl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the shave is awesome.  I was so worried about the \\&quot;learning curve\\&quot; from the Gillete Fusion to this.  Scared to come out missing 3 layers of skin.  Not the case. No learning curve at all.  I&#x27;ve read reviews of people talking about razors hacking their face up, this one doesn&#x27;t do it.  I like the Derby razors that come with it too.  I&#x27;m still exploring which blades work the best, but think these are perfect for starting out.  I do have some Feathers and Red Persona&#x27;s and am eager to try them, but so far, the Derby&#x27;s are great.  It is weird to change the blade after 4 or 5 shaves, but at 25 cents per blade, who cares.  Not $5 per cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gents, if you only take 2 things from this, It&#x27;s a quality Razor  AND  Buy it.  Don&#x27;t think, click add to cart.  Get yourself a good pre-shave oil, a badger brush and soap (no more funky un-natural shave gels),and a good aftershave (Proraso Splash).  And a little whiskey is a good compliment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
    <li> I really like this razor, the weight of it feels really right in my hand.  But I was beginning to wonder how many different blades I&#x27;d have to try before I found one that really worked well.  Trying to find a perfect blade (brand) for my particular razor, shaving style, skill, face... It looked to be a long process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I noticed one day last week that my not having tightened the handle completely changed the shave quality of the blade I was using.  For the better.  So I decided too try it (loosening the handle) deliberately, and found that it changed the shave quite a bit.  The problems were, of course, the very limited adjustment range, and that loosening the handle even slightly allowed the head assembly to rotate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I visited the plumbing repair aisle of my local home store and bought a box of #36 o-rings, which seemed about the right size.  They were, and fitting one over the threaded post between the head assembly and the handle allowed me to adjust the pressure on the blade while preventing the head assembly from turning. The o-ring cushions and holds the handle firmly, and allows for a range of clamping pressure and head height.  Tightening or loosening the handle changes the performance of the razor, as expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s true of all razors, but this razor has a circular inset where the handle meets the lower head assembly.  The o-ring pretty much disappears into it, with just a thin black line showing at minimum pressure.  It looks designed and intentional, which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a sampler of blades when I bought the razor, and in my initial survey I found that their performance varied from ineffective to hazardous.  With the o-ring in place the aggressiveness of the blade can be increased, but not decreased.  The less effective blades work better, with all but the least effective becoming quite usable.  The hazardous blades got worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hypothesis is that the gap height, blade angle (resulting from the curvature) and leading edge position determine how well a given blade works with a given razor.  Looking closely with a magnifying glass I can see that tightening the handle from first contact to maximum pressure causes the blade curvature and angle to increase while at the same time decreasing the amount of blade exposed (slightly) and the vertical gap between the edge and the lower head assembly (quite a bit).  Blade stiffness also seems to increase, but I don&#x27;t have a way of measuring that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it!  And let me know if it works for you.  I&#x27;m very curious to hear whether it works for other people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Davee (resulting from the curvature) and leading edge position determine how well a given blade works with a given razor.

    <li> Great quality shaver I find this just a tiny bit more agressive than my Merkur 34c. I would say to anyone wanting to try DE shaving buy this razor you won&#x27;t regret it. Buy some blade sampler packs, my favorite blades are the Astra platinum they work great in every razor I have and are usually at a fair price.</li>
    <li> First shave with this and I got closer than I ever did with cartridges. Minimal razor burn, but I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s only because of poor technique.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve found DE shaving a pleasure with this razor. Even better than when I was a teen using Gillette DE razors. This razor is well built. The plating is thick and smooth. It is on the heavy side, and that&#x27;s what I like. Overall, great shaver with great quality of manufacture. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Screw broke off in the handle after a few months. Did not drop the razor, but the screw just broke mid-shave. Purchased five moths ago. Was great until then.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect choice for first-time safety razor users.  The quality of the Edwin Jagger DE89 series is top notch with flawless chrome plating.  The razor is fairly mild and won&#x27;t scrape or cut you in normal use (be sure to read or watch instructions on using a safety razor first!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While vintage razors can be fun to use, I prefer a new razor for beginners.  I had purchased a used 1960&#x27;s Gillette but did not realize it had been dropped at one point and the razor had an uneven blade gap.  This made for uncomfortable shaves with an increased risk of cutting the skin.  The DE89 is very consistent and has a formed blade gap that cannot be knocked out of alignment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One complaint you might come across is that this razor is made from &amp;#34;pot metal&amp;#34; and is susceptible to breaking when dropped or rusting if the chrome chips.  That is true, but there are two things to keep in mind.  First, these razors aren&#x27;t fragile and will stand up to the occasional drop (just like a cell phone).  Second, a machined solid steel razor costs around $200.  You can afford to replace this razor several times over at that price.  But the number of these razors rusting or breaking is very low.</li>
    <li> Best razor have ever used. Cheap simple tech. Just find the right blade for you. Nice balance to the razor.</li>
    <li> the finish on the product was good,the weight was good along with the size Ithought the handle would be to short but it was just the right lenght. Cant wait to try it with Feather blades.</li>
    <li> Very good quality, outstanding chrome work. Matched with the Derby blades I got a great shave. Would highly recommend this razor to anyone that wants a.real shave.</li>
    <li> Received as a gift. Outstanding product! Everyone has their own &amp;#34;thing,&amp;#34; but the look and feel of this razor are great! Solid.. no rattles or looseness. The handle might be a little short for some, but it works for me!</li>
    <li> Excellent razor but the handle was too short.  I took the longer handle off the Royal razor and put it on the Edwin Jagger and it was a big help.</li>
    <li> Bought it for the boyfriend and he fell in love with it... wonders why it took him so long for  him to switch to using one</li>
    <li> Build quality looks and feels great. Haven&#x27;t really gotten the hang of using a DE razor yet.. but as far as I can tell it&#x27;s a good rig.</li>
    <li> Such a great product. Well-made and appears extremely durable.&lt;br /&gt;Really like Personna, Wilkinson Sword, and Shark blades in here.&lt;br /&gt;The infamous Feather DEs are still a bit too sharp in this rig (and I do NOT have particularly sensitive skin).&lt;br /&gt;Hope to hang on to this for many many years...only time will tell.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving with plastic double and triple blade razors for over 40 years. After doing some reading, I decided to take a page from my father&#x27;s morning ritual and using a traditional safety razor. The difference is tremendous. Using feather double edge blades, I was able to give myself a quick, close, and comfortable shave. The handle has a good weight feel and seems to be built to last. Money will spent.</li>
    <li> Razor doesn&#x27;t get close enough, leaves about a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow worth of stubble around the nose and by the chin, I used three passes, with the grain, across the grain and against the grain and it did fairly poor job.  I tried different razor blades:  Feather, Astra, Super Steel, no luck.  Looking at threads on Badger and Blade this seems to be a fairly common gripe with this razor, you can use a spacer to make it more aggressive but I would just recommend a different razor.  It felt like I had to press down on it to try and get closer, which you&#x27;re not supposed to do.  If you want a similar razor to this a would get a stainless steal Maggard Razor that uses this head in the scratch and dent section for $15-17 if you want a similar Razor.    I switched to a 1960&#x27;s Gillette Red Tip Super Speed on the advice of the users in Badger and Blade and I&#x27;m happier with that.  I&#x27;m also eyeing a Muhle R41 and vintage Gillette Slim and Gillette Fat Boy, but supposedly the Red Tip is the best.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor.  I was torn between both this and the Merkur 34c and ordered both.  I tried cancelling the Merkur about five minutes after I placed the order but I got the \\&quot;no guarantee of cancellation\\&quot; message and they shipped it anyway.  I did send the Merkur back and had to pay return shipping for it and I wasn&#x27;t happy about it but that&#x27;s another story.    Anyway, I got this and I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.  It&#x27;s well balanced, along with being very easy to assemble and disassemble. It&#x27;s a three piece razor, which just means that you unscrew the handle and the other two pieces come apart so you can insert a new blade.  This doesn&#x27;t mean that the razor is cheap, it&#x27;s just that some razors are two piece (with the little screw that turns to separate the top like wings, so you can put in a new blade) or three piece.  In truth, I prefer a three piece because you want to keep the razor and razor blades clean, so it&#x27;s easier to clean up.    If you&#x27;re new to shaving with a double edged razor, let me tell you that a decent razor and compatible blades for you are essential to having a good, nick and cut free shave.  You might think that a razor is a razor, so why not just spend $5 or $10 on a cheap one? Well, that&#x27;s what I did initially and I regretted it.  I bought a cheap, $4 DE piece of junk and feather blades.  I looked like a horror show afterward, because of all of the nicks, cuts and blood.    So, what&#x27;s the difference?  Well, the cheapie had a big gap between the guard and the blade and there was no adjustment or alignment possible. From there, I got the feather blades.  Feather blades are generally accepted to be the sharpest DE razor blades out there.  Trust me, this is a recipe for disaster and that&#x27;s exactly how I cut myself up so bad - a razor with a large space gap, the sharpest blades I could find and my inexperience.    The EJ89 is different.  Aside from being a beautiful razor, it&#x27;s weighted very nicely and easy to control.  The gap between theguard and the blade is much smaller and the razor is aligned well. The advantage in having a lesser amount of blade exposure means that you will get a good shave but that it&#x27;s more forgiving in the fact that if you make a mistake, you either won&#x27;t cut yourself or you won&#x27;t cut yourself as bad.    If you&#x27;re converting over from using a cartridge razor, expect a small learning curve of about two or three weeks. When you&#x27;re shaving with a cartridge, like a fusion razor, you&#x27;re likely used to putting more pressure on the the razor and the blade to get a close shave and not worrying about cutting yourself.  With a DE razor, you can&#x27;t do this.  You don&#x27;t need really need to put pressure on the razor, you simply need to guide it and let the weight of the razor and the blade do the cutting.    The blades: these are every bit as important as the razor.    Derby blades:  A great blade to try or start with. They give an excellent shave, aren&#x27;t nasty sharp and I&#x27;d say they&#x27;re somewhat forgiving when it comes to errors.    Feather blades: If you like the idea of samurai sharp steel pressing against your face, so you can look like a blood sacrifice or someone who is trying to commit harakiri starting from your face down, these are the ones to go with.  I mean, you can try them in the future, just take my advice and don&#x27;t make them the first blade you start with.  You don&#x27;t have to have THE sharpest blade out there to get a smooth shave.  You can get a smooth shave with all of them without having to look like ritual death.    Treet blades: I like these.  They&#x27;re very sharp but not too sharp to cause a lot of nicks and cuts.  I get a great, smooth shave without any problem at all.  These are my preference.    Quite honestly, order a sampler pack of blades so you can experiment and see which blades work best for you.    Last, let me point out how cost effective shaving with a DE razor is: If you buy blades in bulk by the 100 or 200 pack, whether here or elsewhere, you can get those100-200 blades for the price it would cost you (or less) to buy a single 8 or 12 pack of Mach 5 Fusion blades.</li>
    <li> Perfect weight, balance and easy to clean and change blades. Will be buying another one to keep at work!</li>
    <li> Works well with derby extras and feather blades.  Razor has a lot of weight to it and seems extremely durable.</li>
    <li> hubby loves using it!</li>
    <li> This is a great razor although I didnt recieve the lined version. Mine came as smooth/polished, although after using it several times I&#x27;ve never felt the need for additional traction. It would be 5 stars if it was lined/grooved version as advertised. The original box is labelled as lined. So I believe this was manufacture&#x27;s fault, not amazon.</li>
    <li> After reading many reviews online (including those expressed in a blog dedicated to men with ridiculously thick beards), I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend.&lt;br /&gt;He&#x27;s suffered through electric razors that got stuck (ugh, the horror stories!), and through other blades that seemed to barely make a dent in his facial forest, but right off the bat this razor did the trick - he LOVES it.&lt;br /&gt;He had never used a safety razor before and, as the manufacturer advises, I too recommend going slow and gentle while getting used to this product.&lt;br /&gt;It works super effectively, so you only need a light hand.&lt;br /&gt;After a few uses he got the hang of it and now he can shave effectively and efficiently!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also good for the ladies too! Just remember, slow and steady and gentle!&lt;br /&gt;Smooth shave is an understatement!</li>
    <li> I have the Merkur 180 long handle and the Merkur Progress.  The Edwin Jagger DE89Lbl is much smoother.  For me, the Merkur&#x27;s are too aggressive and the with the Merkur Progress on 1 it still irritated my skin using Merkur, Feather, and Personna blades.  The Edwin Jagger with Derby blades worked the best for me.</li>
    <li> This is a first rate tool.  This is the second DE razor I have purchased from Amazon.  The first one was a Parker butterfly model.  The Edwin Jagger is very precise in comparison.  After a couple of weeks of practice I can get an awesome shave.</li>
    <li> The razor looks great.  The shave is mild and forgiving.  It seems perfect for a beginner.  My thick beard laughs at the derby blades, so definitely tryout a blade sampler pack.</li>
    <li> Beautiful razor, feels heavy in the hand, three-piece design makes cleaning easy. Quality construction and fair price. I would recommend this razor to any novice or veteran shaving enthusiast. I like to describe it has having a certain rugged elegance.</li>
    <li> So far, I like this DE razor and like the experience of using the DE razor. I was already wet shaving, my head that is, so I already had a bit of experience with shaving. I have nothing to compare this to. It seems mild for beginners such as myself. The chrome, fit and finish are absolutely amazing. I decided to go with the lined handle because it matches the lined base. I have no problem recommending this razor.</li>
    <li> After finding myself unsatisfied with standard cartridge shaves, I started looking into wet shaving. I considered a straight razor but wanted to start with something less risky and expensive. Enter the Double Edge Safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hesitated between the Merkur HD34 and this razor, and after reading reviews that they were both extremely high quality I chose this one due to the fact that it is slightly milder and less expensive. It is extremely well balanced and a pleasure to shave with. I have not found myself irritated and have had very few nicks. It turned shaving from a chore to a time i look forward to. I get unbelievably smooth shaves and my skin has cleared up too.</li>
    <li> I bought it in august 2014. It broke in may 2015-the thread is stripped and I can&#x27;t tighten it any more.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this razor.  After using more expensive razors (particularly the awful Merkur Futur) this one has won my heart.&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- great price&lt;br /&gt;- comes with five awesome derby blades (I haven&#x27;t changed the first blade yet!)&lt;br /&gt;- BUTTERY SMOOTH!!!!  It&#x27;s like angels sing when I shave now.  The blade is perfectly tensioned and you don&#x27;t even feel it on your skin.  I had no idea shaves can be this awesome.&lt;br /&gt;- zero nicks, no blood loss!  ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- effectively none, but I wish there were better ways to manage changing blades with DE razors.  Handling a wafer thin razor isn&#x27;t comforting.</li>
    <li> This is my first razor of this sort bought with only looking at photos online.  When I opened the box I was surprised that it was smaller than I expected but it handles just fine.  Chromes is super nice...this would make a very nice gift but it is just dropped in the box wrapped in paper.  It comes with 5 derby blades too so should get you through a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving....I was hesitant it would be tricky to do but you just set the guard parallel to your face and gradually tilt the handle up to you can just barely feel the blade and let it glide down.  This thing just glides right down and shaves super smooth.  If you tilt up to high yes you can stick yourself with the blade so just take it slow and you will get it. I like the shave I get with this especially since i have super coarse face hair.  I can shave daily with this and not get tore up which is what I had hoped for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me this takes no more time than shaving the normal way.  It cuts a little closer too so I get a nice smooth shave just on one to two passes depending on area.  Neckline already looks better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor itself once again look super nice.  If you have never had one before this ones is great!</li>
    <li> I have shaved for over 40yrs, and have used various razors, the Iast razor I used was the gillette fusion proglide, but no more. From now on its the Edwin Jagger De89lbl Double Edge Safety Razor it has provided me the best and smoothest shave that I have ever had. I wish that I could give this safety razor 5 stars but I could only give it 4 stars as for it does not have the butterfly type opening to clean and or change blades and It would be nice to have the handle alittle bit longer. A great shave at a great price. And the double edge razor blades are very affordable.</li>
    <li> I got tired of being forced to buy Gillette&#x27;s Mach systems.  I shave my face and head on a daily basis and go through razors quicker than the average person.  I got tired of paying for the Gilette&#x27;s every month.  I believed/hoped that there was another system so i bought the Jagger double edge.  Its a nice close shave but you have to change the razor daily, or flip it.  Ive cut my hands a few times and Ive added even more items to my bathroom countertop.  I can now see why that old technology and the Mach-3 system if new.</li>
    <li> This razor is well made, has great balance and is easy to maintain.  I reviewed many sources prior to my selecting this razor and I&#x27;m quite happy that I selected this particular razor.</li>
    <li> If youre looking at this review, it probaly means you are researching wet shaving and wondering which of the 2 razors always mentioned for beginners to choose - you should actually put down your money on.  Having owned both of these super popular and recommended razors I will provide the absolutely immediately noticeable difference.  As objectively as I can, here is the comparison of these 2 wildly talked about/recommend \\&quot;industry standard\\&quot; razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Merkur is the more aggressive razor, actually it&#x27;s rather noticeable (although still considered a mild/beginner razor)&lt;br /&gt;EJ is the much more forgiving razor and smoother (and the \\&quot;prettier\\&quot;, \\&quot;shiny\\&quot;, aesthetcially pleasing razor as people keep commenting).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Merkur is a much smaller/skinnier razor (the 34c which most people get.. come with a much heavier/thicker handle) and has a MUCH better grip (with the knerling pattern and \\&quot;ring\\&quot; near the bottom of the handle).&lt;br /&gt;EJ is chrome-plated and much smoother and aesthetically \\&quot;wow\\&quot;.  The hanlde is much wider and a bit longer, but the grip can easily become challenging if handle or fingers get semi slippery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Shave:&lt;br /&gt;I found the Merkur to be very noticeably aggressive and thus much more susceptible to discomfort and irritableness of skin. (but read on on my &#x27;ultimate lessons\\&quot; regarding all this below).  Most will tell you \\&quot;the more aggressive, the closer the shave possible\\&quot; and yeah theoretically i can&#x27;t argue.. EXCEPT.... the EJ hands down gives you a smoother, closer shave from my experience (my latest test was to use both during the same head/face shave.. using the same blade... with the Merkur getting the fresh Feathers blade and the EJ having gone through a full set of shaves that i end up typically having to toss out the blade when using Feathers).  Hands down the EJ was much smoother, needed less clean-up time to get there, and felt much more comfortable throughout.  I ended up using the EJ to clean-up the Merkur side (b/c the Merkur side was just becoming too uncomfy and raw on my head).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one advantage of EJ i&#x27;ve come to think of having read all the reviews is... the EJ head is somehow holding the razor just a bit better to create a closer, while more comfy shave and somehow EJ just seems to work REAL WELL with the sharper blades like Feather (infact Feather is specficially mentioned as a blade that works and feels REAL GOOD with the EJ razor).  Given that I have narrowed down my favorite blades to the mild and universally considered \\&quot;sweet spot\\&quot; Astra blades and \\&quot;sharpest in the industry/clinically sharp\\&quot; Feather blades.  I think that EJ feels comfortable and gives a nice smooth/close shave with both blades is a strong testament to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So.. winner EJ.  Its&#x27; far more forgiving.  It actually gives a closer shave on top of that (rare to hear both).  Seems to be compatible and work extra well with multiple different types of blades (be it mild or sharp).  Has the larger/longer handle (although not so good with grip.. but wait.. for my \\&quot;ultimate lessons\\&quot;), and i think is even cheaper now (on Amazon atleast by a few ~ you can get it for $28.. while the merkur i think is in the high 30/low 40s).  Plua it&#x27;s prettier, comes in a super nice box, etc.  It&#x27;s just hard to beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOW.. \\&quot;ultimate lessons\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;firstly on these two razors.  I recommend getting a 3-piece razor over a 2-piece razor (which is why I say if you like and want to try Merkur, get the classic safety razor instead of the 34c... the 34c is a 2-piece, the classic safety is a 30piece).  With 3 piece razors you can mix/match heads, holders, handles from any brand and mix them up to customize a razor exactly the way you like it.  This saves you some money as anything you buy you can use and swap with 3-pieces, not so with 2-pieces or butterfly heads (which are 1-piece).  dont&#x27; like the handle of the EJ de89 (most don&#x27;t.. ) not a problem - just get a new handle you like and you can still enjoy the benefits of the ej de89 razor head/holder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next.. what&#x27;s more important in yoru shave experience and performance is prepping your face well and the cr&amp;egrave;me/soap you buy to lather with.  And what you want to look for... is long lasting, and re-activating SLICKNESS ~ one that doen&#x27;t quickly dry up whie you shave.  The razor \\&quot;glide\\&quot; on your face is everything - so focus on SLICK (most people will just review based on latherability, richness, and smell - enh.. not helpful in the end).  Let&#x27;s face it.. we&#x27;re here to shave.. so how it comes off with the razor is really what&#x27;s important (not how it goes on!).  The best product i&#x27;ve found so far.. which i recommend you get , available locally in drugstores, is Cremo Cr&amp;egrave;me.  Its super slick, don&#x27;t need to lather, and re-activates with water.  By far the most comfy, smoothest, \\&quot;glidiest\\&quot; shave.  But I&#x27;m continuing my search now with soaps (figure they&#x27;re slicker than cr&amp;egrave;mes in general).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OH... brush.. Badger?  Boar?  Synthetic?  To beginners I would say get a synthetic until you learn more, get more experience, become more acquainted with what you like and brand names and reputations so you can hone in on the exact brush you want and why.  Can&#x27;t go wrong with a Synthetic until you can find better elsewhere. (they clean easier, dry faster, are soft, don&#x27;t shed as much, don&#x27;t smell, and cheaper.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Shaving and have fun....joy the benefits of the ej de89 razor head/holder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next.. what&#x27;s more important in yoru shave experience and performance is prepping your face well and the crème/soap you buy to lather with.

    <li> I&#x27;m so happy I bought this safety razor. The weight is perfect and it looks amazing! I get a really nice shave too!</li>
    <li> If you are reading this, it&#x27;s likely you too have gotten tired of the expensive cartridges or expensive replacement Electric razor blades, or want to return to a more classy era of shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I have used this Edwin Jagger for 20 months, switching from both the expensive multi-blade cartridges and Expensive Norelco electric replacement heads. I have also purchased and tried the Merkur Futur and the Merkur 180 long handle.&lt;br /&gt;  The Futur is very difficult to get a close shave especially under my nose and the blade adjustment of the Futur is a seriously over rated and unnecessary feature.  It would either not cut whiskers or cut me if not set just right. I hate it.&lt;br /&gt;  The 180 long handle feels lighter with less balance in my opinion but is better than the Futur and shaves pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;  I also steered away from the butterfly safety razors because they have moving parts to wear out and I wanted to know my blade was secure at all times. I feared the &amp;#34;missile hatches&amp;#34; would shift during shaving and perhaps change the blade angle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;1) Saves me a lot of money in blade cost. I pay $1.49 for 10 blades that last me over two months. I now pay about $8.50 / year for blades.&lt;br /&gt;2) The balance is wonderful. The weight of the razor does most the work.&lt;br /&gt;3) Price is just right for the lasting quality value and lifetime of use.&lt;br /&gt;4) The handle length is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;5) After 20 months of daily use, it has cleaned up with a toothbrush and Dawn dish soap to look as perfect as the first day I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;6) The chrome is impressive to look at.&lt;br /&gt;7) It does not slip in my fingers while shaving despite the chrome.&lt;br /&gt;8) A dull DE blade gives a closer shave than a brand new Norelco blade/head assembly.&lt;br /&gt;9) No hair tug and pull as I got with electric and multi-blade cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;10) The blade instantly rinses out and I have never seen any blade clogging with that dirty nasty whisker/cream soupy mess that never seems to come out.&lt;br /&gt;11) More hygienic than multi-blades and electric shavers because the blades clean out super well.&lt;br /&gt;12) No more pushing those light expensive cartridges into your face to achieve a close shave, the weight and awesome blade does the work for you.&lt;br /&gt;13) I no longer get any ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;14) Only 3 parts-nothing to break or wear out unless it often gets dropped or the handle gets overly tightened.&lt;br /&gt;15) The handle stays tight and in place with only hand tight torque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;I seriously cannot think of any except:&lt;br /&gt;1) (A training curve) It took me about three shaves to figure out the proper technique, but have never looked back.&lt;br /&gt;2) (Time) I can no longer shave while driving to work as I did with the Norelco. Was that dangerous?&lt;br /&gt;3) (An attitude change) I now look forward to my next shave.........Is that normal?&lt;br /&gt;4) The razor might out live me. I guess my kids might find it near the vanity and they can fight over it when I die.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I used to dread shaving, but now cannot wait till my next shave especially when combined with Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandlewood shaving cream or Proraso or another quality cream or shaving soap.</li>
    <li> This is the finest razor I have ever owned! After having wasted hundreds or possibly thousands of dollars on trac II, mach III,  et al I finally get an outstanding shave for literally pennies on the dollar compared to the current technology! A couple of bucks for blades and soap which outlast the multi-blades and foam by weeks in conjunction with the Jagger razor equals an outstanding shave at a fraction of the cost! The Jagger rocks!(no pun intended!). Why would you shave with anything else?</li>
    <li> I got this for my father with some other items, he uses old style razors, so far he loved it, no complaints! That&#x27;s all it matters.</li>
    <li> Pretty new to wet shaving/safety razor. Started with this razor and discovered that I this works well for me with gillette 7&#x27;o clocks (all colors) and feathers. Have since switched to merkur slant and get closer shaves. This razor feels like a much better razor than the merkur slant in the hand and I will certainly keep using it when I get sick of the occasional nick from the merkur. The weight feels perfect and the construction is flawless compared to the merkur which has very small imperfections.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think I could be more pleased with this razor, especially for the price. The weight and size are just about perfect, and the aggressiveness seems just right. I do have to admit that this is only my second safety razor, but is far superior to previous one I bought (a Merkur long-handle). I would recommend this razor over the Merkur, which for me was way too mild (and for some reason only shaves at all on one side of the razor).</li>
    <li> This is my first safety razor. It feels good in the hand, is a good size and weight, and is easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lots of blades available. I bought a sample pack that includes a variety of manufacturers. They&#x27;re all a little different and all certainly cheaper than shaving with cartridges. The expensive handle pays for itself the first time you don&#x27;t have to buy cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was a small learning curve to shaving with a safety razor, but I like the feel as I&#x27;m shaving and the results so much more than a Mach 3.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this razor. Use it every morning and actually look forward to shaving now. It is a quality product and looks great. Glad I am not paying $2 - $3 each for cartridges. I get a better shave with this razor. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> My 1st DE Shaver. Have barely had any nicks or cuts. Have achieved really close shaves using Personna Blades (Red and American Blue) and Astra blades. Have tried many blades with this DE and finding the right blade is more important I feel than the actual DE though. Looks great, but need to wipe down every few days to get the soap stains off and keep nice and shiny</li>
    <li> This product really is a very fine razor. I have used it for almost a year and the only complaint I have is the price. I suppose that if I were to stubby pencil the savings over the years on blades for modern &amp;#34;quattro&amp;#34; types, that I probably will more than break even over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone who has the money to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice weight, nice finish, smooth working and definitely quality product.</li>
    <li> This razor works fine. It has a great finish and it is easy to grip to an extent. Wet soapy hands do make it a little slick but still grippable. Even though I got the De89lbl the handle is very short. The blade works well but gave me razor burn when it was new. This may be the soap more than the blades but I will also be trying a multi-brand pack of blades to find the one that works best for my face. I am still on my first blade and just noticed it tugging a little today after 7 days of use. I find the position on my face really makes a difference. I only nicked my self the first two days of use. You really do need a light touch.</li>
    <li> So this is the third safety razor I&#x27;ve owned. This first was a Parker 96r, then I bought another TTO razor while in Australia, which is branded as a \\&quot;Comoy\\&quot;, but it&#x27;s a Weishi, the same razor they sell on tv and in retail stores. This Edwin Jagger has a shorter handle than my Parker, a longer handle than my Comoy, and is much heavier than both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shaved with this the first day I had it and couldn&#x27;t be any happier. I enjoyed shaving with my Parker, but I didn&#x27;t know things could get any better until I used this Jagger. The razor is held a little higher off of the comb than the other razors I&#x27;ve used, but it&#x27;s been a lot easier to get that cutting angle locked in my wrist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a three-piece razor, which I think holds the razor in place a lot better than TTO safety razors. I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s going to loosen while I&#x27;m shaving at all. I&#x27;ve noticed in other reviews people mentioning the handle being a little slippery, but I haven&#x27;t had that problem at all. With both of my other razors when I would do the final pass going against the grain, the razor would skip and snatch on thicker parts of growth. What surprised me the most was that not happening at all, the razor just glided over the hair with a clean cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finishing my first shave with this razor I hadn&#x27;t cut myself once, my face didn&#x27;t feel raw or irritated anywhere, and it wasn&#x27;t an insane amount of effort trying to get a great shave. This razor is also really, really shiny. The chrome seriously does look pretty fantastic.</li>
    <li> I just received my DE89LBL today an I can say hands down best razor ever, I am a in my 20s so I haven&#x27;t had many years of shaving, but always found it a hassle to shave. I was looking for a more cost efficient razor an came across the edwin Jagger at first I thought Ehhhh but I figured what could I lose to give this razor a try? I am in love best shave ever took a little longer then I thought but I&#x27;d give this razor a 100 out of a 10 to 10 question.</li>
    <li> Today, I shaved for the first time using a double edge safety razor with this Edwin Jagger with a Derby blade that came with it.  First off, it is very nice to look at and has an amazing finish on it.  I was a little aprehensive to try shaving with this type of razor since  I&#x27;m 40 years old and have always shaved with a disposable and I read many comments from others that  said scary things like: be careful! and there is a learning curve! and you may cut/nick yourself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All good comments.  Ok, not really!  I had a good first shave with it.  I did not nick or cut myself.  I did not find it difficult to figure out the angle the blade cuts at - it was actually very intuitive - if you have too wide an angle against your face it doesn&#x27;t cut your whiskers.  If you have too narrow an angle against your face, it doesn&#x27;t cut your whiskers!  Brilliant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all seriousness though, it is a solid feeling razor.  It seems to be well made.  It has an amazing mirror like chrome finish.  The thing looks and feels like it will last a long time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be afraid to try using one of these style razors - if you treat your normal cartridge or disposable razor with the respect it deserves against your skin, you will not butcher your face into hamburger using this one :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Edwin Jagger has a permanent job shaving my face!</li>
    <li> Great razor use it every few days. It&#x27;s nice! Great balance and weight.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a handsome razor, with good weight. The shave isn&#x27;t super aggressive, but close enough for me. Great lines and a good overall look.</li>
    <li> This is a really really nice razor. After having this for a few months using anything else just seems crazy</li>
    <li> No more razor burn after I&#x27;ve been using this, Maybe it&#x27;s just my skin type that reacts so well to the razor, but after I ditched the Gillette Mach 3 whatever bs they advertise everywhere for this safety razor, my skin is smoother, no more ingrown hairs or pimples on my neck area a day after shaving. Plus it&#x27;s reusable and blades (even great ones, I use Astra Superior Premium Platinum blades). Make sure you use a nice shaving cream and aftershave ( like the awesome Geo. F. Trumper)</li>
    <li> Best investment I’ve ever made.  Tired of spending hundreds of dollars a year for sub par razors, i switched to this razor to try it out, and haven&#x27;t gone back.  With the right blade, my face has never been shaved as smooth.</li>
    <li> Ordered the Edwin Jagger razor after reviewing many. Was not disappointed. Excellent product and would recommend this very highly</li>
    <li> My first DE razor. It works well and gives me a great shave. I have learned to make three passes. The first is straight down. The second is crossways. The last is straight down again. This works well for me. The Derby blades that came with it are okay, but the Personna blades I tried are much sharper.</li>
    <li> Great build quality and comfortable in the hands.  Provides me with a good close shave when paired with the proper blade.  Blades seem to last for 2 or 3 shaves, and cost about 11 cents each.  Quite a bit cheaper than the gillettes I used to use!</li>
    <li> This razor has given me the best shave of my life. I&#x27;ve got a sample pack, but I&#x27;m already at shave #3 with the first of the five included Derby Blades (which are considered to be beginner friendly).  And I&#x27;ve had the best shave of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been shaving since age 13. I have used either disposables, starting with the single edge Bic razors (the yellow/orange ones that look like their cheap ballpoint pens) and moving to most recently the Shick ST2 disposables. I&#x27;ve never used the swivel heads. With disposables, I&#x27;ve gotten maybe one good shave, and the rest of the time its like dragging a dull butter knife across my face. Even so, many times I have thrown out a disposable razor just from the start as too dull or nicked fresh out of the bag, for shaving. Sometimes two or three in a row.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used electric razors, never ever gotten a good shave or had one last either beyond a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t understand why I did not switch to this safety razor years ago! Leave aside cost, this is the best shave of my life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin, and have been shaving in the shower with the Schick ST2s and Barbasol shaving cream, usually cutting myself good every other day too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first shave, I cut myself (mildly) on the upper lip being too aggressive, since then no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am down to two passes, one with the grain, and then against. I had to do three passes or more, sometimes five, with the Schick disposables.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My set up: The Edwin Jagger De89lbl (you want this one because the vertical lines on the chrome handle provide extra grip, the other models are smooth). The included Derby razor blades, still on the first one. I bought the Van Der Hagen brush kit, including soap and mug, at a local place, but you can get the deluxe or cheap version here at Amazon for competitive prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shower, wash my face, shampoo, rinse off the shampoo and put on conditioner. Then, having soaked my brush inhot water in a mug while showering, I whip up lather with the brush and soap in the included shaving kit from Van Der Hagen, getting stiff peaks like whipping egg whites and its pretty easy -- takes maybe two minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shave with the grain and then against, maybe a pass on a few minor areas that need touch up (I go by feel).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: if you cut yourself go back into the shower, for a few minutes, that usually stops the bleeding. I then rinse off the razor, dry it, and put everything away. Put on some aftershave and you are done, total time including shower and shave is about 30 min. Not bad either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are transitioning from disposable razors especially if you have not used the stupid swivel heads you are good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few other tips: choke up on the razor like a chef&#x27;s knife when you are doing detail cutting. The shorter handle than the plastic disposables really does not make much difference, because you are going to be very gentle and using a choke grip for greater control. The weight of the razor will give you all the cutting power you need, unlike plastic disposables.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EJ recommends that you loosen the razor handle so the blade is not bent after shaving, I put mine in the medicine cabinet and use the shelf to loosen and tighten the handle, not touching the head of the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When putting in a new razor blade or changing, I do it before I step into the shower when the razor is bone dry, and use (I saw this in Youtube videos) a sandwich approach with thumb and forefinger on the short, non-razor blade edge side, to keep them together. I&#x27;ve seen other videos where a guy puts a towel down on the sink and uses the towel to stabilize the razor heads and does not even touch the head. I have not tried it but seems straight forward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend a variety pack of blades, part of the fun of this razor is trying different kinds of blades. That&#x27;s the point of a safety razor, you can have all sorts of different blades for dirt cheap and get the shave you want, it is endlessly customizable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my third shave with this razor and coming from disposables, I find it very similar to use, just nicer in every way. I plan on shaving one more time with this razor blade, then before shaving (again when the razor is dry) cleaning the whole thing with anti-bacterial soap, a toothbrush, and hot water. You don&#x27;t want to use bleach or vinegar because it will take off the chrome, keep it simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line on this razor is that you WILL save money, but the biggest advantage is the closest, least aggravating, smoothest shave you&#x27;ll ever have in your life. I already have the smoothest skin on my face after a shave. It is Baby Bare Bottom smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final caveat: the head is made of some zinc alloy, so don&#x27;t drop it. Yes you can get comparable vintage razors with stainless heads, you&#x27;ll pay a LOT more for them and they won&#x27;t be new either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot recommend this highly enough. The razor will give you the best shave of your life.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful razor.  The first safety razor in my wet shaving career.  The chrome on this is superb and fit and finish is world class.  I know I&#x27;m talking about a safety razor people, but it&#x27;s a very very very nice piece.  I would expect something that looked this good to be over $100, but I&#x27;m very happy that it&#x27;s not :)  I see this lasting a lifetime.  It has a nice weight to it so it&#x27;s easy to let the blade do the cutting and not have to apply pressure to get a good shave.  Blades fit nicely, the threading is also very nice and smooth.  I love it!</li>
    <li> First de razor I&#x27;ve purchased. Right call. Read reviews and decided on the appearance of this over the others. Weight is perfect for me. Barrel length is perfect for me. Works well with any blade I&#x27;ve tried. The weight lets the blade do what it&#x27;s designed to do even after 1 too many shaves. I&#x27;ve read where everyone rates the old Gillette&#x27;s the best for people just starting. I bought a &#x27;66 super speed. Great little razor, and definetly withstood the test of time well.  Shipped it to my father for his 70th birthday. To me, there is no comparison between this and the Gillette. I&#x27;d take this without hesitation.</li>
    <li> The is a very nice looking razor, shaves well, but very slippery to hold on to when shaving, This is not a good thing when your hands are wet. I would not recommend to beginner shaver.</li>
    <li> Finally decided to switch from expensive multi-blade cartridges to the double edge, and I&#x27;m glad I did. Used the derby blades that came with the razor, and it shaved perfectly the very first time I&#x27;ve ever used a double edge razor. I&#x27;m hoping I&#x27;ll no longer have to deal with ingrowns and pimples from shaving with those multi-blade cartridges anymore.  I bought a 100 pack of the derby blades as well, so I shouldn&#x27;t have to buy another blade for something like 4 to 5 years. Definitely satsfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I am very new to wet shaving so take what I say with that in mind. After listening to a very good friend tell me the virtues of shaving with a safety razor for a few months, I was curious. After going to the store to buy some more cartridges for my Schick Hydro 5 razor, I was convinced. I remember seeing my fathers safety razor shave equipment when I was a kid, but by the time I was starting to shave (1986), disposables had become the norm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After browsing the shaving forums and reviews on Amazon for months, my choice was down to this Jagger and the Merkur 34C HD. I couldn&#x27;t decide and from all the research I have done I believe the consensus is just pick one and go with it. They seemed very equal in recommendations to beginners. Well I chose the Jagger of course and I am very pleased with my purchase. The fit and finish are excellent. The chrome is like a mirror and flawless. The razor has some weight to it which makes it feel very solid and I can see it easily lasting a lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first shave with the Jagger was nerve racking but actually pretty smooth. I was pretty nervous about this new way of shaving, but the Jagger made sure it was a pain-free and enjoyable experience. Now after a few more shaves under my belt, my technique is slowly improving and the Jagger is helping me the whole way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just can&#x27;t find anything to complain about on the razor. I would recommend this razor to anyone starting out. While I am still learning proper technique, I am enjoying my shaves with the Jagger very much.</li>
    <li> Bought this years ago and still use it when every I shave. If you&#x27;re looking and its a great price... buy it</li>
    <li> There is a learning curve but I have not gotten cut by this thing.  It took about a week for me to be comfortable with this razor.  Shaves close and have almost no complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I am not a big fan of the way to replace the used razor.  You have to unscrew and disassemble it to change the razor.  You can get easily cut yourself.  Not the best design, but I still like the razor.</li>
    <li> I bought this with a packet of 100 blades and It&#x27;s very economical. I only go to the stores for shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;It can be a bit rough if you apply too much pressure with the wrong angle.&lt;br /&gt;To save blades from wearing out, I recommend you shave with electric shaver first then finish off with this shaver for a smoother and cleaner finish.&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s great and the price is quite reasonable, but I would prefer stainless steel material for more durability and a longer handle for more comfortability.</li>
    <li> Reason for 5 stars?  Because the Edwin Jagger it is exceedingly beautiful, shaves well, and is something I think anyone would be proud to own.  Interestingly though ... its not the razor I use to shave with in the final analysis.  However that&#x27;s not to say that it doesn&#x27;t provide a good shave ... because it does.&lt;br /&gt;Since 1960 I&#x27;ve been shaving with my father&#x27;s two old 1950s vintage Gillette razors (butterfly opening type ... one made in the U.S. and the other made in England).  But when he died I inherited his razors (so they&#x27;re special to me).  But this past April it occurred to me that these were the only razors I had shaved with all my shaving life ... so I decided to go ahead and see (for the first time) what it would be like to shave with a new razor.&lt;br /&gt;After researching a bit I bought a Merkur 23C (also known as the Merkur 180).  Its a nice razor with a very nice and relatively light, hollow 3-7/8\\&quot; handle.  However I found that it doesn&#x27;t provide nearly as close a shave as my old Gillett razors.  After shaving with the 23C I can re-shave with my favorite Gillett and take off more whiskers for that infamous \\&quot;baby bottom smooth\\&quot; shave.  I just can&#x27;t get that with the Merkur.  That made me curious. That curiosity led me to buying another razor called a Maggard (an internet search will take you to the Maggard site if you&#x27;re interested ... there are also a few good videos on Utube as well).  I bought a Maggard MR18 (for $15.95 no less) and found that it did provide a shave that is the equal to my favorite Gillett ... and in some ways better).  On the Maggard site I learned that the Maggard has the same blade gap as the Edwin Jagger (0.030 inches).  After investigating the Jagger I bought the Edwin Jagger DE89Lbl.  And there is no getting around it ... the Edwin Jagger is a most beautiful razor.  But I discovered that while it provided a closer shave than the Merkur ... it really didn&#x27;t quite match the shave I get with the Maggard ... not quite.  Why I wondered?  That question led me to the realization that what you really find on most sites is people&#x27;s opinions ... and that&#x27;s all  ... but nothing based on measurable facts.  And I realized that the manufacturers seem negligent in providing design type information (other than size and weight information ... excepy the Maggard site states info on blade gap).  That led me to realize that a razor is the result of a design process where a manufacturer constructs his razor based on certain parameters.  The question is ... what are those parameters?  Obviously two of them are blade gap and weight. For those who would like to know a bit about this read on:&lt;br /&gt;The aggressiveness of a razor largely relies on 5 different factors.&lt;br /&gt;  Blade gap&lt;br /&gt;  exposure&lt;br /&gt;  Blade angle in the razor&lt;br /&gt;  Razor weight&lt;br /&gt;  Distribution of the weight. (Heavy head/light handle vs. all heavy.)&lt;br /&gt;  Blade angle applied by the user&lt;br /&gt;The most important factors appear to be blade gap, exposure, and weight.&lt;br /&gt;The greater the blade gap the more aggressive.  The greater the exposure the more aggressive.  The greater the weight the more aggressive.&lt;br /&gt;The Maggard and the Edwin Jagger both have blade gaps of 0.030 inches.  What I discovered is that the Merkur 23C has a blade gap of only 0.025 inches (so blade gap wise its less aggressive and so isn&#x27;t as likely to provide as close a shave as the EJ or the Maggard).  Just FYI ... the Merkur 34C has a blade gap of 0.028 inches ... so it will likely be more aggressive than the 23C but not as aggressive ... and therefore not give as close a shave ... as the EJ or the Maggard.  I won&#x27;t discuss the razor weights here as that&#x27;s information easily found.  Information on blade exposure is almost impossible to find.  I wondered why the Maggard gave me a closer shave than the EJ.  I found what I consider to be the reason.  A three piece razor has a razor head made of two parts ... the cap and the base (where the safety bar constitutes part of the base). I found that the EJ cap and the Merkur23C cap have what appears to be exactly the same width (standing them side by side).  So the primary difference in the two is the blade gap ... and that appears to constitute the primary reason why the EJ provides a closer shave than the Merkur (and its a bit heavier as well I believe).  However ... the Maggard&#x27;s cap is not quite as wide as the EJ and Merkur caps.  This means the blade is a bit more exposed on the Maggard than it is on either the EJ or the Merkur.  And I think this is the reason it provides a closer shave than either the EJ or the Merkur ... it has a bit greater blade exposure ... and its heavier than either the Merkur or EJ.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway ... these are some of the things I&#x27;ve learned in my researching and I hope they help you in your search for the perfect razor.&lt;br /&gt;With that said ... I still will say that I am still pleased to own the Edwin Jagger as it is an exquisite thing of beauty ... something anyone would be proud to own.  But the fact is ... the razor I shave with now actually is the $15.95 Maggard.  And actually ... if one is not adverse to buying a Maggard that has some cosmetic imperfections he can buy such for $10.95!  In fact I just bought a couple of these for my sons.  Happy shaving ... and \\&quot;shave on\\&quot;!</li>
    <li> You are probably reading this because you&#x27;re like the majority of everyone who&#x27;s reviewed this razor... you&#x27;ve had enough... You want off of the big manufacture&#x27;s merry - go round world of overpriced gimmicky shaving.  In a word... welcome to the second best choice you&#x27;ve made this year. The first one being you&#x27;ve stopped allowing yourself from getting hit by the stupid stick anymore and you&#x27;ve escaped into the wonderful world of wetshaving... your second best choice? ...I&#x27;m getting to that give me GIMME SOME TIME WILL &#x27;YA... ...A little to much... yeah... your probably right... Uhem... The second best choice is actually up to you... BUY THIS RAZOR! Jagger razors have a good reputation for smooth shaving and if you&#x27;re patient (unlike me) you can buy it when the price drops (I bought mine at $41.00 but it does have a habit of dropping to around $35.00 down to $31.00). Snag some DE blades, find yourself some luxury shaving cream (like Paraso or Taylor of old bond street), pick up a quality badger hair brush (like a best badger brush from Parker), grab a good sized coffe mug (just raid your kitchen cabinets you don&#x27;t need to buy a fancy shaving bowl) and you&#x27;re ready to go. This razor seems to get raving reviews in a lot of notably shaving web forums but if you want more proof just look at the sheer number of five-star ratings this beauty has. ...I know Merkur has it beat when it comes to sheer volume in numbers but Merkur also seemingly gets pushed by a lot of mainstream websites so I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s more of a money inflated campaign and not so much a quality thing.  So choose the &#x27;ole loyal mom and pop shop razor and don&#x27;t give in to the Walmart juggernaut razor of the masses choice... just buy the &#x27;dern thing and get over it with.</li>
    <li> I have a long, thick beard so I don&#x27;t use this on my face. I am bald though and I do use this on my head and it works great. I always get a very smooth shave out of this razor when I combine it with a feather blade. This is a good quality razor for a more than reasonable price and it looks awesome. That chrome finish looks incredible.</li>
    <li> Great razor very beautiful and well made. My first safety razor and I made the right choice. I get a wonderful shave</li>
    <li> Perfect!  I have been shaving with this for the past several months and like it so much that I just bought the same one for my brother.  It is weighted just right and clearly shaves better than the cheap double-edge razor I was using previously (nicks are rare now).  The chrome is beautiful, the blades are easy to change without cutting yourself.  I have never had the handle loosen at all while using it.  it feels good in the hand and is not slippery.  Let me also recommend the 100 pack of Astra blades available on this site for a nice price (after trying about a dozen different well-reviewed blades, those Astra blades are my favorite).</li>
    <li> Other than the way that you load the razor (completely remove the head) I like it a lot.&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t have to apply any pressure to get a very close and smooth shave.  Very well crafted and solid.</li>
    <li> provides solid platform for shaving</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying that for $35.00, this is an absolute steal! It&#x27;s chromed out to the max. When I opened it up I was blinded by beautiful chrome plating. My 100th shave was as smooth and nice as my 1st. Perfect razor, and a great razor to get into Double-Edged shaving with!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to the old-school shaving world, as I&#x27;ve been a Mach-3 man since...well, I guess since they came out some 15-20 years ago (damn I&#x27;m getting old).  I remember trying my dads old butterfly-open safety razor as a teen and shredding my face, which pretty much put an end to any fascination with safety razors.  Now, since the SAME razor refills I used to buy at $5 bucks are now some $25 (thats some freaky inflation, folks), I thought I might rethink my position on going back to Mach-1 safety razors and give &#x27;em the &#x27;ol college try again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First thoughts:  This razor is b-e-a-utiful.  Wow!  Don&#x27;t see quality like this anymore in todays disposable world.  Nice weight also.  I cannot find a single flaw.  Very luxurious look and feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave:  I&#x27;ve very pleased to share, I&#x27;ve not cut my face to shreds yet.  I&#x27;m still on my first pack of Derby&#x27;s that came with the razor, but it seems I&#x27;m doing well.  The razor is very comfortable against the face, and seems to guide me to that just-right angle for the best cut.  No problems getting up under my huge schnoz, but am having a hard time with the crease-wrinkle thingy that runs vertically between my nose and upper lip.  Just cant seem to get in there.  It could very well be my anatomy, since it is pretty deep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final thoughts: the handle could be a bit longer, but I think that&#x27;s simply a product of all these years with the Mach-3.  Though, if it did have a longer handle, I might be tempted to grip it the same way and use wayyy to much pressure.</li>
    <li> Nice DE razor. Make the switch from cartridges, your wallet and face will thank you!</li>
    <li> Razor worked beyond expectation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to anyone looking into safety razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect weight as well as a very sharp look.</li>
    <li> Im new to the DE world and wanted to try. After much research, and speaking with folks, I picked this razor and have not been let down. I like the solid, quality feel. In my limited experience, I have concluded that the razor blades  are as important as the razor. I have used darby and currently use Persona. I prefer Persona. Different blades for different type beards. I have a medium growth. I am a work in progress when it comes to technique, but I love the closeness this razor provides. I actually look forward to shaving! Still experimenting on various shaving soaps. Only a few nicks after couple weeks.......Buy It!</li>
    <li> This is my first DE safety razor.  After doing some research due to skin issues with shaving I came across the idea of going back to a double edge safety razor.  I dug into the subject (badger and blade forums are awesome) and decided on this razor.  The item received was as described.  It felt good in the hand and the fit and finish is great.  This morning I used it for the first time and WOW!!  I&#x27;ve been using a disposable since I was 17 because my beard became to thick for an electric to deal with.  This is the first time I&#x27;ve shaved in 15 years and it didn&#x27;t feel like I had just rubbed my face with sandpaper.  My chin was smooth in one pass, my neck didn&#x27;t breakout even after going against the grain, it was a wonderful experience!  Do you homework.  Read up on technique and study some youtube videos and you&#x27;ll be all set.  I highly recommend this razor along with a good brush/soap/bowl kit.  I now look forward to shaving every day!</li>
    <li> Have been using this razor for about a month. I have previously used a Mach 3 and similar razors for the past 20 years. Love this new way of shaving! It&#x27;s much cheaper at 7 cents a blade, which lasts a week, and as I said the whole shaving experience is now much more enjoyable. I work at a job where a close shave isn&#x27;t really necessary. We all look a little homeless and scruffy, so that 5 o&#x27;clock shadow Don Johnson look is ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For this model though, the handle is super slippery, resulting in loss of grip. Then it fell off the sink, breaking in two (because of slippery grip). So now it&#x27;s garbage. Most expensive disposable ever! hahaf sink and it broke. Hooray! Am now justified in buying a Merkur and see if it&#x27;s a little better. Also, Derby blades are poor quality with regard to shaving performance. Astra much better.</li>
    <li> The Edwin Jagger DE89lbl feels nice in the hand, sports refined styling, and is sure to last a lifetime if cared for. What more could I ask for in a non-adjustable razor?</li>
    <li> I bought this double edge razor for my husband as a gift.  He uses it everyday and he says (and I feel) that it gives him a smooth face after he shaves.  He says that it feels so smoother than the 3,4&amp;5 bladed disposable razors that he has used for years.  Now he can go to the store and buy so many more double edged razors for less than a quarter of the price of those 3,4&amp;5 bladed disposable razors.  Less waste from the disposable packing too!</li>
    <li> My neck is one of those super sensitive necks(electric razors give me razor burn) and shaving simply once a week would result in terrible razor burn. After trying every trick the internet had for me and still finding no solution. I switched over to this safety razor and have not had razor bur since, even after shaving 4 days in a row! Wish i would have learned about safety razors when i first started shaving.</li>
    <li> Bought it as a gift.  It was well received, although, I now hear that the razors blades that come with the shaver is of poor quality.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my father for Christmas.  He loves it!!!  I bought this and the 50 pack blade sampler.  He gets to try out a whole bunch of blades and find the one that works best for him.  He said this gives him a great, close, shave.</li>
    <li> This was a pretty good razor: moderately close shave, OK feel, nice to look at. But then it fell about a foot onto the sink and broke in half. Very poor craftsmanship. Replaced with a Parker 92R, a massive improvement.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he tried it out and walked out with just a mustache! He says great product for shaving anything you need to have shaven. It works nicely and he says the most important thing, it did not clog up.</li>
    <li> I started shaving with a double edge razor forty years ago. I&#x27;ve tried every Gillette razor from the First Trak razors to the Fusion Mach 5. I even have a motorized Art of Shaving Razor for the Mach 5 blades, but with the Jagger and Wilkinson blades I get a closer shave. Yesterday, my wife said that my face might be smoother than hers! I see some fellas struggling with cutting themselves. My suggestion is to loosely hold the razor handle near the bottom with just your three fingers (thumb, index, and middle) and use the weight of the razor. Also, shave in the shower. For confidence, you can pick up an anti-fog-shower mirror from Amazon. They work well. Good luck!</li>
    <li> It lasted about three months. My gf knocked it out of the basket in the shower and the screw that seats in the handle snapped in two. Blame it on whatever you like, but any razor should be able to sustain a three foot drop to a rubber bath mat without breaking. I&#x27;m disappointed. Fifty bucks down the drain. I thought this was supposed to be cheaper than cartridge razors?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is in the design. This is a three piece razor. Unless you plan on babying the de89 and giving it a name and using it exclusively next to your bathroom sink, don&#x27;t buy it. Go with the Merkur 34c or a similar two piece razor. The difference in design makes them more durable.</li>
    <li> Item seems to be of good quality.  I was surprised that the handle is shorter than what I am use to using.  Looking forward to my first shave with this one.</li>
    <li> Nice chrome finish. Great weight and detail in the finish. Smooth when shaving and easy to clear and clean. Hard to beat for the price.</li>
    <li> I was always intrigued by DE and classic shaving methods. The misses got me a great Art of Shaving set for the holidays and i decided to go for it and purchase the DE razor as well. Its great. Not easy to use but certainly not a nic waiting to happen. I nicked myself once near the gap between my nose and mouth partially due to Derby blades being a bit dull (sharper blades like Bic and Gillete no nics ever!) I certainly feel in control and comfortable using this daily. I do look forward to shaving and its process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair grows in healthier and my skin is smooth. I would only say don&#x27;t rely on derby blades. try a sample pack, the derby&#x27;s didnt allow for a close enough shave for me and I got minor irritation going over and over areas. Razor is beautiful and easy to use. The lined plating allows for a nice grip when wet and the razor glides easily with a nice warm chrome surface to press against your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this razor to anyone who wants to be clean shaven</li>
    <li> Upon delivery the razor was packaged very well. Chroming on this razor is some of the best chroming I have seen, and you can clearly see that Edwin Jagger puts a lot of care into their razors. For the price you pay you are really getting an incredible razor that not only looks great but is well balanced and provides an incredible shave. If you are considering purchasing this razor do not hesitate to pick one up.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend who struggles with in grown hairs. This helped a ton. The quality is fantastic. Very heavy. The razor does the work for you.</li>
    <li> Beautiful razor.  Substantial feel.  Much better than plastic razors.  Respect the blade and you will get a much better shave all over your body than any plastic razor.  I feel fantastic knowing that I will not be contributing to the plastic island floating in the sea or a landfill.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my Edwin Jagger De89LBL.  It isn&#x27;t overly aggressive so it works well for newbies and it gives a very nice shave.  The head has good weight so it stays close to the skin giving a nice close shave.  It also has very good balance and feels really good in my hands.  Before this I used a really cheap DE razor I bought off Amazon for like $2.00 just because I was new DE shaving and wanted to see if it was something I would enjoy.  I thought the previous razor worked okay, but after I got my Edwin Jagger DE89LBL I realized I was really missing out.  This thing is so much smoother and gives an amazing shave.  My only complaint is the handle can get a little slick while shaving but that is easily remedied as you can purchase a different handle if you want.  It hasn&#x27;t bugged me enough to go out and get a different handle.  The other thing I love about this razor is it looks really good.  The chrome finish really pops and looks nice.</li>
    <li> this is an amazing deal for the money and stacks up against the more expensive.  Gives a smooth, clean shave. Easy to maintain and a pleasure to use. Clean shaves every time. A real find.</li>
    <li> I was the typical newbie. Young, skeptical, figured it was a small fad. I was wrong. At first using the included blades I got a fair bit of irritation. I was about to give up on DE shaving thinking that everyone was wrong and that all blades are the same. Luckily, i tried some different blades and now LOVE this thing. I have never had a better more comfortable shave. I don&#x27;t even do all of the brush and soap shenanigans, just some good ole Barbasol menthol does a great job.</li>
    <li> I have used a plastic razor for the last 40 years till I took the chance on a change.  I trully enjoy using this double edge product, and shaving with it is as easy as pie.  Had it for over a month now and have not gotten one nick - of course I can see how easy that can happen if your not paying attention and slide the razor sideways - but you would get that with a single edge plastic one just as easy.  Really pleased, it has a nice weight to it, and, I got a great buy for razors at my barber shop!!</li>
    <li> Best razor yet gives my sensitive face a smoth comfortable shave even with the sharpest razors. Will by more Jagger products.</li>
    <li> I have numerous Safety Razors and have used them all. From the Merkur 34C to a Parker and so on. This Edwin Jagger model DE89L is second to none. I probably have the most sensitive skin known to man. The weight is perfect as well as the size. If you are having any second thoughts on buying this razor then think no more. For the price you can&#x27;t beat and the craftsmanship is beyond great. Did I mention that the chrome is done by the same company that does the chrome for RR. Yes its that good.</li>
    <li> I looked forward to receiving this razor but I am very disappointed.  I disassembled to insert the razor and felt that the top was very light.  After looking it over I found that the top parts are made of chrome plated plastic.  I stopped shaving with plastic razors years ago.  I screwed the handle back into the plastic top and tossed it in the recycle bin.  It may have given me a great shave but couldn&#x27;t have lasted very long.  Plastic is for toys, medal is for tools.</li>
    <li> the product does not work that well. it is not well balanced, hard to control due to heaviness.&lt;br /&gt;it will not shave around corners well around the chin area.&lt;br /&gt;it will take you longer to shave. the only good thing is cheaper razors that go into it.</li>
    <li> I hated shaving when I used to use straight razors. The tugging and pulling were a pain and on top of that I would not get a close shave. As I still young, I would form pimples within minutes of shaving. I researched and found out about Double Edged Safety Razors. I found Edwin Jaggers to have the best reviews on Amazon when it came to the DE razors, so I gave this a go. Keep in mind that I am a beginner at using DE razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After shaving with the Edwin Jagger DE razors a couple of times, I noticed that there is no tugging and pulling. DE razors will by far give you the closest shave and my girlfriend can&#x27;t stop touching my face because of how smooth it is. I do not get any pimples at all. None. Overall, my shaving experience has definitely improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest problem I had with DE razors were the cuts I got on my neck and below my lips. This is mostly because I am a beginner and still learning the art of shaving with DE razors. I recommend that you use a high quality shaving cream with a shaving brush.</li>
    <li> I bought this Edwin Jagger double edge razor several weeks ago and this morning was the first time I tried it.  Several other reviews indicated this was the best thing since sliced bread. I&#x27;ll go even further.  I am kicking myself for using plastic throwaway razors that last for only 1 or 2 shaves for all these many years.  This razor is very easy to use.  I didn&#x27;t cut myself even once.  But the closeness of the shave completely blew my mind.  Much closer than anything I can remember.  This is a perfect razor for any man. It is beautiful to behold and well balanced.  It would make a wonderful Xmas present that is assured to please.  The ladies might consider this as a present for their men, who will think of them fondly each day as they shave, even long after the breakup / divorce! [[ASIN:B002RBF1PO Edwin Jagger De89lbl Double Edge Safety Razor Chrome Plated Lined Detail, Chrome]]</li>
    <li> I purchased the razor about 14 months ago. It was a nice razor with a good chrome finish. Did a good job. Basic razor, right. It came with a small rust spot on the underside of the top curved piece, next to the screw/stem. I soak my DE razor from time to time in vinegar to clean off all the stubborn soap scum/buildup. When I did this a second time with this razor the screw/stem began to corrode. I can still screw into the razor and use with no diminished effect. I wrote the Amazon seller about the situation, including pictures, and they said that because the razor has been used for over 90 days there is no warranty. They suggested I write EJ, which I did. No reply. I will try again to get in touch with EJ, but I am writing this review as I shop for a longer life DE razor. I am disappointed because these razors should last a lifetime. The Amazon seller is clinging to the warranty even though the razor is defective. Bad form. Upon further reading of the less favorable reviews of the razor, someone mentioned they chrome plate a cheap type of metal. Cheap enough to be affected by vinegar.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 10/6/2013:&lt;br /&gt;Shortly after I wrote my initial review I managed to get in touch with W/ EJ. They apologized for my getting one of the small percentage of razors that were incorrectly manufactured and sent me a set of new, in perfect condition top and base of cutting head plates. So I have been using the EJ razor this whole time. I still get soap scum build up even if I rinse in H2O after each use. I have soaked it in H2O2, isopropyl, and just water since receiving the new plates. The screw stem is slowly degrading.  I keep seeing the term \\&quot;Pot Metal\\&quot; with the reviews of this razor. My conclusion is that the parts that corroded would not have, had they been of a better quality. I will acknowledge that a less acidic solution than straight vinegar to clean the razor is prudent.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 6/8/14:&lt;br /&gt;The replacement part that screws into the stem failed again. It was slowly eroding since I put it in use last year. Today the stem would not screw in to the plate. The razor is no longer functional. I am not going to pursue another EJ, rather I&#x27;m gonna spring for an Above The Tie!!!! Happy Day!!</li>
    <li> the razor works very well but handle seems short compared to mercur i had before.. which i dropped and broke...other than that works great..</li>
    <li> I love, love this razor!  I&#x27;ve used safety razors for approximately a year now and I absolutely love this razor!  I used a Parker 22R long handled razor previously and after I dropped it in the shower, I sadly parted with it when it no longer provided a safe shave.  I&#x27;m so glad that I dropped it because I didn&#x27;t know that there was a superior razor to what I had!  The Edwin Jagger razor is awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shave my face every day and my head every other day using Derby Extra blades and to save myself a bit of time, I usually shave in the shower.  With the Parker I used to nick myself quite regularly, since switching to this razor, I&#x27;ve gotten nicked once!  This razor has proved to be a treasured tool in my house.  100% recommend!</li>
    <li> Classic, very well plated and well made! On of the best safety razors you&#x27;ll can buy for the price.</li>
    <li> as good as my merkur 34</li>
    <li> Solid product.  A year in I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> Just got this a few days ago and so far it is MUCH better than disposable razors.  It is a good weight, but the handle feels a little short compared to what I am used to, which is why four stares and not five.  A slightly longer handle would be helpful when shaving the backs of my legs, but as familiarity is gained, i do not believe that it will be a real issue.  I have been using the blades it came with and I don&#x27;t plan on changing that.  When used in conjunction with the [[ASIN:B00869RTM4 Jason Natural Products - Shaving Lotion Beard &amp; Skin Therapy - 8 oz.]], my legs are smooth and razor burn free.  This razor and shaving lotion have resulted in the smoothest shave.  In addition to the cost savings, one of the best parts, is that the shave lasts longer than when using disposable razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be sharing the wonders of this razor with all my female friends.  Women should really consider trying this razor; more cost effective, environmentally friendly, and a great shave!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information on women&#x27;s use of DE or straight razors, see Badger and Blade forum (thread: women and de shaving).  [...]</li>
    <li> The Jagger is a decent razor. The quality is on par with the Merkur 34C. HOWEVER, the shave is not nearly aggressive enough for my taste. The Derby blades (supplied with the DELbl) do this razor a huge injustice. So much so that I was ready to &amp;#34;pitch&amp;#34; this razor and return to the Merkur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After switching to Feather blades, 89 is a much better shave. The fit and finish is comparable to Merkur and Parker. I&#x27;ve only been using this razor as a daily shaver for about two weeks, so it&#x27;s too early to judge durability or longevity. It does seem to be made fairly well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 4 words: Razor good blades crap.</li>
    <li> Its a razor, it shaves. However, the handle is to slippery when wet and the plating is easily chipped.</li>
    <li> Just a little aggressive for my skin.  I like the workmanship, finish and quality of the build.</li>
    <li> Short handle, heavy and has a tendency to slip out of your hand.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like spending my money if I don&#x27;t have to.  More than that, I prefer function over form.  So after my wife decided should could no longer bear with the awkward way my beard grows, I had to remove it and keep it at bay, but I hate shaving.  No, really.  I loath it.  Razor burn, pimples, and ingrown hairs are the primary offenders, but the cost of cartridges and disposables that will do a somewhat decent job sends me over the edge.  Enter the DE safety razor market.  I did my research, read reviews, and spent time checking the prices and decided on this Edwin Jagger as my first.  I like the weight of it, the coolness of it, and the fact that I get a great shave at a fraction of the cost.  It came with five Derby blades which worked well on my face, but had problems with the angles, tougher neck hair and multiple grains that grows.  Didn&#x27;t want to waste money on a sampler pack to use blades I don&#x27;t like, so I read a few reviews and decided to go with a 100-pack of Astra SP Platinum.  So far I am thoroughly impressed and glad I went with that combo.  Amazon Prime 2-day shipping and $11.30 makes that $0.11 per blade.  Love DE shaving, love this Edwin Jagger razor, and will never go back to cartridges (God willing).  ONE NEGATIVE NOTE:  After 1 1/2 weeks of use the chrome has peeled off, revealing the base metal underneath.  Does not affect the function, but it sure looks bad.  UPDATE:  Once again Amazon comes through with great customer service by sending me a replacement free of charge!  The replacement has been in use for nearly 7 months and I still can&#x27;t say great enough things about it.  I use Astra Superior Platinum Plus blades from Amazon and purchased the 100-pack at $10.94.  That&#x27;s $0.11 per blade.  If you changed it out everyday it would still only cost you $40 per year.  These blades are sharper than Derby blades, but not as aggressive as Feather&#x27;s.  Say goodbye to Mach 3 and the other cartridge shavers for good!</li>
    <li> Quality item and fast shipping. Thank you!  A+++</li>
    <li> This is my first safety razor and couldn&#x27;t be any happier. It is built really well and is nice and heavy. It just looks awesome. It came with 5 Derby blades and both give me a real smooth shave.</li>
    <li> After I finished shaving I reached up to grab something out of the vanity and it slipped out of my hand.  It fell a total of MAYBE two feet and landed in the sink.  When I looked down I wasn&#x27;t happy.  The bolt connected to the handle snapped CLEAN off.  It is sitting inside the head.  It was a great shave, and it may look nice, but these razors are VERY poorly constructed.  This razor had so many great reviews I didn&#x27;t think it would have any problems.  After looking at all of the one star reviews on amazon it looks like it is a common problem.  As a matter of fact, after a quick Google search it looks like a HUGE problem based on all of the internet shaving forums I have visited.  If you buy this razor you better handle it like you are holding a vile of nitroglycerin.  This will be the last EJ product I ever buy.  Sorry for all of the caps, but I&#x27;m a little pissed off right now.  Looks like I&#x27;ll be getting a Merkur two piece.  Hopefully they are built better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I sent an email, a picture of the razor and my receipt less than 24 hours ago and got this response from EJ:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dear Dan,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for your email, which was passed to our department by a colleague.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are sorry to hear your news; there have been a few such instances out of the thousands we have sold due to similar misfortune.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor heads are made of high quality cast metal but, as I am sure you know if you are familiar with other cast items, Le Creuset for example, cast metal is robust but brittle and thus must be handled carefully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for your email, and including the photographs. From this we can identify the razor as a DE89L and see that the screw thread remains in the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not always clear why a head may shear, often it is due to over-tightening or being dropped. If the screw post is embedded in the handle, some of our razors can be returned for repair as we are able to remove the post and affix a new head. However with your razor this is not feasible so we will need to replace the razor for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please confirm your delivery address and we will arrange for a replacement to be sent to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We hope to hear from you soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kind regards,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Repairs Department - KC&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edwin Jagger Ltd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;www.edwinjagger.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;www.facebook.com/edwinjagger&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their razors may not be built sturdy, but their customer service is top notch.  I will still hold this like I am holding a vile of nitroglycerin though lol.</li>
    <li> Best Razor. Craftsmanship is a 10. Handling is a 10. Perfect weight. It glides over the skin and slices the hair right off, almost levitates. Yeah, I think levitate is a better word to describe it. All jokes aside best razor I&#x27;ve ever used. Hands down.</li>
    <li> Very nice razor.  The handle dissembles easily for quick changing of blades, yet screws on tightly for stability.  This razor is weighted very nicely, and seems finely crafted all around.  Some people have mentioned that the chrome wears off.  At first I thought that was happening too, but I think it was shaving cream buildup, since when I scrub it, or scratch it, the polished chrome surface shows through below, looking good as new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend getting the Escali razor and bush stand with it.  I think both my razor and my brush will last much longer with it, and it looks good and makes it convenient for storing.</li>
    <li> Favorite razor! Best shave yet. Your mileage may vary.</li>
    <li> I will never use one of those gimmicky multi blade razors again as this thing is mazing. If your even thinking about buying this just do it and you will be happy.</li>
    <li> excellant craftsman ship , one of the best razor i ever used.</li>
    <li> Cutting my fingers while trying to replace a blade isn&#x27;t my idea of a good razor. I quit using it the first week.</li>
    <li> Been shaving with the fusion family from Gillette for years and a few months back I took a dive into wet shaving by buying this razor. This razor and feather blades are perfect for my face; I can&#x27;t believe what I have been missing out on for so many years.</li>
    <li> Quality piece that is a pleasure to use and look at.</li>
    <li> This was my second safety razor purchase. The EJ razor is far superior to the cheap razor that I purchased at a department store. It has a nice weight and balance to it. Even though this is the &amp;#34;lined&amp;#34; model, it is still difficult to hold on to when your hands are wet. Over all, a good razor.</li>
    <li> I tried this out with high expectations but it&#x27;s not for me. I shave often and I take very good care of my skin. In my opinion this is a step backwards in time. Technology has come along way even in shaving. If you don&#x27;t think so, then you wouldn&#x27;t be shopping on Amazon. There are too many good products out there today that shave and feel allot better then this. My Panasonic electric razor is much faster and closer. http://amzn.com/B002N5MHLU I can also use it wet or dry. This will never replace a 5 blade razor either.  The only advantage of this is cost. Sorry, I&#x27;ll stick with Panasonic and Gillette. It&#x27;s the best a man can get!</li>
    <li> It arrived snapped in half. It wasn&#x27;t usable at all. However, it does looks good. Nice and shiny chrome with a good weight to it. Will be reaching out to seller for a refund. Very unfortunate. I was really excited to try it out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a lady and wasn&#x27;t sure this would work well.  I&#x27;d prefer a longer handle ergonomically for shaving legs, so I thought about the Merkur but I went with this one cause the blade angle&#x27;s not as &#x27;aggressive.&#x27;  Glad I did, I do get more nicks than I do with a safety razor on my legs if I&#x27;m in a hurry.  But it&#x27;s totally worth it.  I&#x27;m getting less ingrown hairs and the $$ saved is fantastic!</li>
    <li> My first safety razor and probably last.  Great quality, nice feel.  Just right.</li>
    <li> One of the best ones on the market. I bought one for myself and one for my Dad.</li>
    <li> After much research I decided to purchase the Edwin Jagger DE89LBl, for my return after many years to wet DE shaving. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my decision. This is a finely made, good looking razor that holds the blades well and is weighted just right. It also came nicely packaged. I highly recommend this razor for anybody considering either going back to wet shaving or experiencing it for the first  time.</li>
    <li> I like the gilette fusion. Im gnna stick to the fusion instead.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, wonderful product!! My husband loves it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my bf, among other items, for his birthday. He was always complaining about not being able to get a close enough shave. He also has sensitive skin. This little gadget fixed all of that. Good quality, worth the price!</li>
    <li> Best razor I&#x27;ve ever owned.  I have read all the reviews and it seems like this is grouped with the Merkurs and Parkers, but for the money it really is in a league of its own.  I chose this one and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  It is weighted in such a way that you only need to use the weight of the razor and there is no need for additional pressure on the part of the shaver.  It is an absolutely beautiful piece and provides a great shave.  I am throwing away all of my Mach 3s and fusions and using only this.  I am brand new to wet shaving and cannot believe I waited until I was 34 years old to start.  Don&#x27;t bother with the Utopia or any of the chinese $15 and cheaper razors-----they are garbage.  BUY THIS RAZOR YOU WILL BE VERY HAPPY.    I cannot give this razor enough praise!</li>
    <li> My favorite way to shave. This thing has heft to it with the amount of weight it has and the way they built it. It is nicely made. This shaver should last forever. If you prepping and thinking you will not be able to shave buy this and buy the soap and the blades....and it will be there long after you are dead.</li>
    <li> Great razor. Easy to use. Good grip when wet.</li>
    <li> Solid, high quality and I been saving a lot of money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying this product. I just need to know, when it&#x27;s time to change blades.. so glad that they sent a total of 5 blades.</li>
    <li> Great investment wonderful shaver with great balance</li>
    <li> As a way to save money from purchasing the ever increasing prices of cartridges, I decided to take the plunge and buy a double edge safety razor. I read a few reviews, including those on Amazon and around the web, and settled on this model.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll tell you, it does what it supposed to do. It&#x27;s known to be less aggressive than other models, such as Merkur&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was easy to screw apart the razor to mount a blade. And easy to put back together with a blade mounted&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first shave today with it produced no cuts. It was smoother than any cassette I&#x27;ve ever used. It was actually quite nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars, because it does what it was advertised to do, and does it flawlessly.</li>
    <li> This is the best thing I have purchased. It saves a ton of money on blades, even compared to Dollar shave club. I still buy regular razor blades for certain situations where I need to shave quickly or to touch up some hard to get places with this product. The best results I got from it was to trim the hairs down with an electric trimmer that I already had. I have a mirror in the shower and keep a cup to fill up with HOT water to let the blade sit in. The warm feeling of the steel feels great on your face! All in all a great purchase for the money and would highly recommend it to anyone thinking of moving away from the regular blades.</li>
    <li> Ok, I love this razor. I have always dreaded shaving because it felt like a chore with the standard Gillete razors and such. But with this razor, even after almost a year, I get excited to shave. The body of the razor has a very good balance and still has the ability to be gripped when wet. Beautiful and functional, I cannot recommend enough.</li>
    <li> This is my first DE safety razor. I&#x27;ve been using it for about three months now, and I really like shaving now. I&#x27;ve been thinking about getting an antique one that&#x27;s a little more expensive, but this one will definitely do for now. It has a nice finish and a good weight. I&#x27;d recommend.</li>
    <li> Works great, nice weight.</li>
    <li> Wet hands definitely slip on this grip. The ridged grip would probably work better. I have to stop and dry my fingers sometimes.</li>
    <li> When I first opened the box and took out the shaver I was immediately impressed with its look, weight and feel. It is slightly longer than my previous DE Shaver which is perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of shave that it gives paired with a good blade is just uncompromising. No pressure needed to be applied so to speak, the shaver did it&#x27;s work from the weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied buyer.</li>
    <li> Great Razor, very well made, using the razor for over a month and love it, great shave.</li>
    <li> Nicely weighted as expected.</li>
    <li> The only complaint I have is that the handle is a bit too short.  It does just as good a job as my old Gillette and I don&#x27;t have to break the bank on refills.</li>
    <li> Being in the military, I have to shave every day. This razor is great quality and easy to use. I found that blades are also super cheap. My store carries them 10 for $1.49! And the price isn&#x27;t all. This really gives you an amazing shave. I no longer get bumps and razor burn like I did with the 40 blade razors. Highly recommend this brand. The cost of this thing compared is a no contest.</li>
    <li> Pretty, pretty razor. Very high end. Paired with a chrome bowl and chrome handled brush this set looks great in the bathroom.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the quality of finish, weight and design. After 45 years of using multiple blade razors, I was surprised to learn this simple design provides the closest and best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a Jagger. Enough said. This a precision instrument and feels like it. Well built, handles like a dream and gives very close but maybe slightly aggressive shave. Paired with a Feather blade, it just doesn&#x27;t get any better.&lt;br /&gt;Do not waste your money on the cheap razors. Spend the $50 or so and get this razor. It will perform flawlessly for many lifetimes.</li>
    <li> came on time and looks just like the picture.  My husband was very excited to try it and says that i works great and is what he needs to start with to get comfortable with the shave</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re thinking about buying it, buy it. This razor has been a great first Double Edge razor, and many people who have tried several different razors still think this is one of the best. I liked the all chrome look, so I picked the 89, and the lined handle helps grip if I still have some shaving cream or soap left on my hands. This razor has some heft too it, perfect for the &amp;#34;no pressure&amp;#34; aspect of double edge shaving, you just keep it attached to you face and the weight will carry the razor for the perfect shave. I have not tried many blades, but the Derby&#x27;s included are perfectly adequate for first-timers, I hear they are relatively forgiving compared to some other blades. Edwin Jagger makes a great product</li>
    <li> It work great nice feel in the hand close clean shave</li>
    <li> I read an article about shaving in the Wall Street Journal and it stated that the best shaves were to be seen with a double edge (DE) razor so I took the dive.&lt;br /&gt;It certainly takes a lot more care to shave with the DE razor.  I have shaved with a Trac II style razor and Edge gel shave cream for 30+ years but I thought it would be fun to give the DE a try.  I do not feel I have a tough beard.  I used Edge gel and the DE and it felt like it was a closer shave.  When i shaved one side of my face with the DE and the other with the Trac II style razor, my wife felt the DE side was smoother but the difference was not significant.&lt;br /&gt;I have shaved for almost two weeks with the DE and only one minor nick.  Some day I will try the DE with a bristle brush and cream to see if that produces a closer shave.</li>
    <li> Works great, saves me a lot of money.</li>
    <li> This razor is pure quality. It has a good weight to it, It doesn&#x27;t seem like a $43 razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used Derby blades and I hardly nick myself. All I need is 2 passes, now I truly enjoy shaving. Get this razor because it is the only razor you will ever need. Experiment with different blades, each face is different. You want a blade and a shaving method that fits your face. My previous razor was a Lord Razor.</li>
    <li> I bought this last june and noticed yesterday while changing blades that the crome coating had came off the post. Very disappointed in this product. I will go to a antique store and buy a razor that was made with pride.</li>
    <li> this is a simple well designed shaver.  it has a solid feel to it.  firm against the skin.  one of these days i will get a merkur to compare against.  NEVER will go back to over priced four and five blade razors again. rick from pawn stars was right.  safety razors are the way to go.  just compare the razor blade prices.</li>
    <li> then is the best razor i have ever bought it is a lot cheaper to use than the mach 5</li>
    <li> Great build quality and a great shave when you get the feel for it. Nice balance. The 5 sample blades that are included didn&#x27;t work well with my skin/hair combo. Great success with this razor and Astra plat blades</li>
    <li> This Razor was everything I could have hoped for in the price range.</li>
    <li> It did work great. I dropped it on the floor while shaving and it broke in half....</li>
    <li> The Best Shaver Love it very fast Shipping</li>
    <li> My husband loves this.</li>
    <li> This is one sharp looking razor.  It is weighted nicely and feels right in your hand.  The shave isn&#x27;t as aggressive as I thought it would be since the razor actually bends the blade when you secure it.  This is a fairly safe and forgiving razor.  I was able to shave completely against the grain with no problems and achieved a real close shave.  The only variable is learning to get a better lather with my soap.  Once I master that I will have this down.</li>
    <li> This is the only safety razor I have used so I can&#x27;t compare it to any others, however, it has a very nice weight to it.  The craftsmanship on this razor is impeccable and the chrome is the best you will see.  This is definitely a blade that can be used for a lifetime and passed down for generations.  I&#x27;ve heard it is a very mild razor (less blade exposure) but with two or three passes I get the smoothest shave possible!  You may be spending a little bit of money here but you are buying a quality piece that will last a lifetime.</li>
    <li> I love it. It looks great and offers a great shave and is super sturdy. A one time investment will outlast you . Blade guard comes off and screws back on easily so it&#x27;s a breeze to clean or replace the blade.</li>
    <li> But it was a big mistake. I also bought some vintage Gillettes on Ebay and the adjustables are all better performers than this razor, particularly in regard to comfort with every blade I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: For some reason I am getting great shaves with the razor and Bluebird blades...cannot get razor burn and get great , close shave...</li>
    <li> Great detail and weight</li>
    <li> I have no nostalgic feelings toward wet shaving, but I started looking into it because, on a lark, I happened to click on an Amazon product recommendation for wet shave cream. Since regular cartridge shaving is a irritating (literally) and expensive, I figured why not give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did my research, and I was surprised to see how passionate some people are about wet shaving. I was skeptical that it would be the life changing experience that some enthusiast seem to claim, but I went ahead and bought a best badger brush, some VDH soap, and this razor. Nothing ventured, nothing gained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll try to update my review periodically and let you know how I feel about it as I get more comfortable with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FIRST SHAVE 1/19/13&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon un-boxing the razor, I was struck by how nice this thing looked. The entire thing is very shiny like a watch or a nice piece of jewelry, and the design is sort of utilitarian/ turn of the century chic. It really is a display piece. It&#x27;s pretty short, about 2/3 the length of my mach3, and it has a nice heft to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adding a blade was easy. Just unscrew the handle, sandwich a blade between the two head pieces, and then screw the handle back on. Voila.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One cheek into the shave I thought \\&quot;meh, this is really no different than cartridge shaving\\&quot;. But then I realized that it&#x27;s no different than cartridge shaving, but at 1/10 the cost of a cartridge. In about 2 months, the razor will have paid for itself, and I will be on track to save about $200 per year on blades. Solid win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the shave was when I noticed the difference in the quality of the shave. My shave was rather uneven due to my lack of experience using the razor. The close parts were much closer than I would normally have gotten with my mach3. Those parts of my face felt really nice. Really, really nice. The other parts were slightly worse than what I would have gotten with my mach3. I had some trouble finding the proper angle for tricky areas like my chin. It was pretty clear that once I get used to using the razor on the more tricky parts of my face, I should be able to get a very good shave all around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a skeptic at first, but I can see why experienced wet shavers say that you can get the best shave of your life with this type of set up. The only con, I can think of right now is that the razor is a little slippery when wet and I got a little hand fatigue from trying to maintain a secure grip. No biggie though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah, the soap and brush didn&#x27;t work so well for me. There&#x27;s clearly a proper soap to water ratio that I&#x27;m missing, and I am probably lacking some finer point of technique. I&#x27;m not very interested in becoming a later making expert, so I&#x27;m going to try it with another type of soap or maybe a cream. But if that doesn&#x27;t work,then I may just switch back to the canned stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 2/10/13&lt;br /&gt;It really is true what they say that finding the combination of products is crucial to having a good shave experience. I think that I&#x27;ve now found my own shave nirvana with this razor, feather blades, and a couple of different creams. That, combined with the right shave technique to bring it all together, and I am now a convert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was contemplating buying a Merkur HD so I could have a slightly more aggressive razor as a back up, but now I feel no need to tinker with current set up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 3/16/13&lt;br /&gt;I had to travel for a week, and I brought my Mach3 with me since TSA rules are vague regarding DE razor blades. Wow, what a reminder of how bad disposable cartridges are! My Edwin Jagger is clearly a better shaver all around. The blades last longer, the shave is closer, and it&#x27;s so much cheaper. I wish that I had discovered wet shaving years ago. I shave everyday now, and I actually enjoy doing it as well. I could never had said that about shaving with my disposables. Invest  little time in learning how to wet shave, and you&#x27;ll be happy you did.l be happy you did.</li>
    <li> he used it for a few months very successfully but had a prevailing bother about the inside of the handle hollowed out and collecting water, so he would have to use a cotton swab to clean it out... then, one got caught in there never to be seen again. the only reason he had to stop using this razor is because one of the threads for the screw part to hold the whole head on it wore off, so he was unable to safely use it, sort of like when a thread on a bolt wears down and a nut won&#x27;t stay on. I was annoyed because it only took a few months for it to happen, but he seemed pleased with it the short time he used it</li>
    <li> This razor is great.  The quality is top notch.  It does a much better job with stubborn hairs than the merkur.</li>
    <li> smaller then i thought it would be but very very good quality. after watching the how its made on hand made shavers i wanted to give this a try. im very glad i did. there alot cheaper then the disposable razors i used to buy. i have a very heavy beard and once you pick up how to use this as opposed to a now traditional disposable one this is a really great and cheap to use product.</li>
    <li> Shave great but very very slippery so I try to dry my hand every time, the grooves are vertical so your skin just slips, too bad, cause the shave is good when you have control, but who ever designed the groove was not so smart</li>
    <li> This is my first, and may be the last, DE Safety Razor. I say last because it is a great product and I may never see a reason to switch. The weight of the handle makes it so you don&#x27;t have to press down on the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for first time users. Of course I cut myself a bit when just starting out, but now the shaves are quick and clean. Make sure to use soap.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a college guy and I decided to take the leap from a multi-blade razor to the retro safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is aesthetically magnificent. It has a shiny chrome finish (the picture doesn&#x27;t do it complete justice). The razor has a nice, heavy feel to it, indicating the quality of craftsmanship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to my Schick Hydro 5 (battery powered). I understand it is comparing apples to oranges, but its my only frame of comparison!&lt;br /&gt;Much heavier - I thought the Schick had a nice heavy feel to it, but now it seems really cheap&lt;br /&gt;Shorter handle - since a safety razor doesn&#x27;t have a pivoting head on it, the shorter handle is a great fit to navigate it across your face&lt;br /&gt;Shave quality is the same - there is much debate as to whether safety razors give you a closer shave, and so far it is about the same quality shave. I blame this on operator error since I have only used the razor a couple of times I have not been able to master the art of shaving with this type of razor&lt;br /&gt;More fun - this razor is much more fun than shaving with a traditional razor. Yes, it takes a little more time, but there is a professional feel to whipping out this razor and shaving with it. Every one of my friends who has seen it instantly picks it up and is impressed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall - make the switch to a safety razor. The classic single blade will make shaving more fun, in the long run its less expensive, and it is a great conversation piece. This particular safety razor is high quality and looks great!</li>
    <li> At first I was worried the handle on this razor would be too short. But in practice, the short handle makes it easier to maneuver to get the angle you need at any time. It&#x27;s nicely weighted and the price is great too. Looking forward to many years of close shaves with this razor.</li>
    <li> I choose the Edwin Jagger De89lbl as my first DE razor after reading and watching some online reviews, everyone gave it amazing ratings and they were absolutely right. I guess I dont have much to compare it to however I can tell you that my first shave with this razor was amazing; no nicks or burns, almost to easy! It was so enjoyable I cant wait to shave again!</li>
    <li> Beautiful, feels GREAT in the hand, no issues with slipping or handling, and paired with Feather blades provides a pleasurable and close shave. I strongly prefer this DE for frequent use,&lt;br /&gt;but favor the SE (http://smile.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B002PQZEHQ/ref&#x3D;mp_s_a_1_1?qid&#x3D;1426540758&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;pi&#x3D;AC_SY200_QL40&amp;keywords&#x3D;straight+razor) for removing anything that might be called a beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The missing star is for the difficulty and danger involved with the process of removing and replacing the blade on this razor. I am not sure if there is a better method, but this one (holding the blade in place along with the loose head simultaneously in one hand while screwing the head down) makes me nervous as h3ll. I haven&#x27;t yet cut myself, but I sweat bullets every time. I feel far safer with the SE listed above.</li>
    <li> I got the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten, with no irritation. I have very sensitive skin, and this razor is fantastic for me. I did not try the included Derby blades. I bought astra&#x27;s blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not going to repeat many of the good things already written. I&#x27;m glad I made the move away from Schick and Gillette. Not only is my skin happy, but so is my wallet at ~ 10 cents per blade.</li>
    <li> I really love this product. I am very new to safety razor but it has been a great experience with EJ DE89.&lt;br /&gt;1. It is a lot smaller than I expected but has a good weight.&lt;br /&gt;2. It really looks very nice&lt;br /&gt;3. Very easy to use and dry&lt;br /&gt;4. Gives me a very close shave and it does not hurt my skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;5. It is very safe so you have to push very hard to cut yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I finally found a healthy and affordable way to shave. I tried shaving machines but they were very rough on my sensitive skin and will leave red spots. I start to use Gillette Mach2/Mach3 etc. They were very good but very expensive way to shave. Also, it still hurt my lower neck. This safety razor is very amazing. It takes little longer to shave but it is really good on my skin and gives me a very close shave. It takes time to learn so do not give up after the first shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Gillette Fusion multi-blade for years.  First of all, super expensive, second of all, just couldn&#x27;t get that behemoth into certain parts of my face (crease where chin meets lower face, cleft in chin, under nose); second, the damn cartridges only lasted 4 or 5 days and cost something like $4.00 each.  By accident, I came across and article on men switching back to a more nostalgic way of shaving.  These guys claimed that the old fashioned double edged razor shaved as close as the new multi-blade razors.  I was skeptical but had this thought:  I can buy 100 top of the line \\&quot;Feather\\&quot; blades and this razor for the cost of two 8 packs of Fusion cartridges so why not give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, it takes a little more time to prepare and shave and you have to pay attention when you shave.  No slathering on some lotion in the shower and dragging the thing all over your face without even looking.  But damn!  They were right!  No nicks, no cuts, and a shave much closer than I ever got with any modern cartridge.  Plus, I could get a close shave in places I really couldn&#x27;t reach before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know anything about all the nuances of wets having yet.  I know there are aggressive razors and mild razors and this one is said to be somewhere in the middle.  It is obviously high quality at a great price and shipped and was delivered on time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, for me, it&#x27;s a better shave at 1/10th the cost of Gillette Fusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, this product seems to be of a far better quality than the Merkur products which corrode rapidly and which Merkur refuses to stand behind blaming, in hundreds of cases, the user&#x27;s water.  I have the same water when I use this razor as I do when I used my Merkur.  The Merkur corroded, the chrome flaked off and Merkury told me to pound sound sand so I&#x27;m a devoted Edwin Jagger fan from now on.</li>
    <li> I just switched to wet shaving after 30 years of using cartridge razors, and I think I made a great choice for my first safety razor with the DE89LBL. The chroming is incredible on this thing. The only part that is not perfectly covered in gleaming chrome is the inside of the handle where the head post screws in, so I need to make sure that this is kept dry and lightly oiled to prevent corrosion. So far I&#x27;ve tried the included Derby Extra blades and a Wilkinson Sword blade and have been very impressed with the performance of the razor. The handle is probably not as grippy as knurled or rubberized versions, but I found the vertical lines help a lot when gripping the handle. It&#x27;s a bit more slippery with wet fingers, but very grippy when dry. The weight seems to be right for the overall size, but I still find myself applying what might be too much pressure when shaving. This is most likely my own bad habit developed after so many years of grinding cartridge blades into my face rather than the weight of the razor. I&#x27;m sure I will develop the correct technique over time. I&#x27;m glad I started with such a fine razor instead of opting for something at a lower price point, although the price of this razor was actually very good when considering the quality and design of it. If you&#x27;re looking for a great starter razor or want to add a quality razor to your collection, this is a perfect choice.</li>
    <li> This razor has the look and feel of a quality product.  It is well balanced and you need virtually no pressure for it to give you a clean, smooth shave with no razor burn no matter what blade you use.  When you put the blade in and tighten, it bends the blade down slightly to fit the metal parts of the razor.  this gives a better blade angle leaving less irritation and a more forgiving close shave!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Off the charts good.</li>
    <li> The blades are very sharp, but I feel like they get dull a little too quickly. That&#x27;s my first problem with this.... My second problem is that the handle is so short on the razor that it makes my hand hurt to use because I&amp;#34;m literally only using two fingers to hold it... If the handle was long enough to allow my entire hand to grip the handle then this would be a 5 star product. It is beautiful... Tough, solid quality item. When polished it shines like beautiful chrome should. Not a bad product at all... In fact, I recommend it to anyone looking for a close shave.</li>
    <li> One of the best razors I&#x27;ve used. For me it provides a less aggressive cut. I&#x27;ve bought more than a dozen razors and this is still one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> No rust and chrome still looks good.  Smooth shave with good weight.  Easy to clean and decent grip.</li>
    <li> Absolutely worth the money.  This DE89Lbl is just absolutely beautifully, the chrome is simple gorgeous and never seems to end.  The entire razor is polished to an outstanding shine.  The included Derby blades are great and help a first time wet-shaver make the transition from cartridge blades.  After only 4 days of shaving with the DE89Lbl I can say without a doubt that I will never be buying cartridge blades again,  they are not cost effective and are just murder on my face.  If you are going to buy this razor or another DE don&#x27;t sell yourself short, do the research, and buy some decent shaving supplies.  The whole process of shaving with a DE will yield better results then a cartridge can in both appearance and comfort of your skin.  All the steps are well worth it.  In closing, this is an outstanding razor and I would not hesitate to recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> I have several DE razors and this one is quickly becoming my favorite.</li>
    <li> After tons of research I selected this razor for my conversion from a Gillette Mac 3 to a safety razor. It&#x27;s a great razor that was easy to acclimate to with very little nicks or skin irritation. I bought an assortment of 80 blades to find the best suited for my face. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> smaller than i expected - but its perfect</li>
    <li> My husband love his new razor !</li>
    <li> I did alot of research about DE shaving. It was between the Merkur 34c or the Edwin Jagger DE89Lbl. I do believe I made a great decision on picking this one. I had a 4 day growth on my beard, and it whacked it right down. I had a few knicks on my neck, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting to be perfect for my first time. Yet the shave was perfect! I read and watched videos of guys saying that shaving with a DE is the best shave that they ever had. I have to agree with them this is bar far the best I have had. I will not be going back to cartridge razors.</li>
    <li> Great razor, cannot wait to use it with the Feather razor blades I just purchased</li>
    <li> I bought this for my dad for father&#x27;s day. He loves it says its the best shave he has ever had. Like others have said it looks amazing not a flaw in it. I have recommended it to people. The ones that have bought it loves it. If you are looking fora gift for ant man this is a very one. As soon as i can spend some money on myself I will be ordering me one.</li>
    <li> Comparing to my merkur 34c:  for some reason the 89 doesn&#x27;t give as good a result.  If you look closely at the angle of blade and everything else, they are so similar.  The result is different though.  Less effort is needed with the merkur, maybe because the handle is longer?  Less passes needed with the same astra blades too.  Just my opinion but the 89 just isn&#x27;t as good.</li>
    <li> I like this razor a lot.  This is my first razor so I don&#x27;t have much expeience. I been using for a year. I planned on getting a few different types of razors but once I got it and got used to it I never really felt the need to buy another one. I really like. Using the Astro Blade and Persona with it. Them feather blades are cool but unforfiving if your new to this. Works well easy to clean good size handle and good grip. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 is because I still. Have nothing to compare it to.</li>
    <li> Read all the reviews on different razors and went to mutilple shaving web sites. This was my choice and I could not have made a better decision. I truly enjoy shaving and this razor is a gem.  So far after using it everyday for three weeks I have not nicked&lt;br /&gt;myself once and I have now moved to the point where I use it just as aggressively as I did my triple bladed razor. The finish on this razor is awesome. Very quality razor all the way around.</li>
    <li> This is my first safety razor and I love it! I&#x27;ve never had such a close, comfortable shave with those Gillette razors or any electric razor. I&#x27;ve converted to safety razors forever!</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful, well balanced razor.  I&#x27;m totally pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Edwin Jagger is a top notch razor that preforms as or even better then other razors that cost hundreds of dollars</li>
    <li> Craftmanship is just outstand.  Very nice feel to it.</li>
    <li> Nice little heavy weight razor!</li>
    <li> This is a whole new league!! I mean its just amazing quality top notch craftsman ship !!&lt;br /&gt;amazing packaging.Something to cherish for the year to come :)</li>
    <li> After hearing about benefits of safety and straight razor shaving I decided to look into the idea of moving away from the Mach 3 that I had been using since they were introduced to the market in the late 90s.  The straight razor seemed a bit too intimidating for me, so I researched safety razors and based on reviews I chose the Edwin Jagger.  It has a nice weight/balance and feels quite comfortable in my hand.  The learning curve was short and after five months of almost daily use I am very happy with how close and comfortable the shaves really are.  For me, this razor provides a closer and more comfortable shave than the Mach 3.  It is certainly possible this improvement is the result of going a little slower and being more careful, but there is no doubt the shaves are better.  As a bonus, the blades that work best for me (the Derby&#x27;s that came with the razor) are very cost effective at about $0.09 each.  I would advise experimenting with blades and shaving creams/soaps to determine the best combination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside that I can think of is if you&#x27;re looking for faster shave this is probably not the razor that you want, my morning routine is now 5-10 minutes longer but worth every extra second.  Also, I don&#x27;t have another safety razor to compare this with, but based on my positive experiences so far it would be a hard sell to convince me to change.</li>
    <li> This razor really is beautiful in a manly way. The chrome on it looks very nice, it has no flaws that I can see. It seems very durable and should last for many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glad I bought this razor I have been wet shaving for a little while now.  I am loving it so far it does take me longer but the results are much better my face is so smooth after a 3 pass shave. If your thinking about trying it do it you won&#x27;t regret it! While I am still working on my technique. I will say that I was surprised at how easy it actually is to save with a double edge safety razor.  I thought I was going to cut my face to pieces the first several times but I have only nicked myself twice so far both being very minor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips&lt;br /&gt;get a good shaving cream!! (not one that comes in a aerosol can) and a badger hair brush! (doesn&#x27;t have to be super expensive)&lt;br /&gt;Watch videos on the technique for using a double edge safety razor and it will help a lot.&lt;br /&gt;Shave when your not in a rush, it will probably take around thirty minutes if you do a three pass shave when your first start out. Time does decrease as your get better at shaving with the DE razor to around 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Try different blades, sharpest isn&#x27;t always the best. Its about find the right amount of sharpness for your face to achieve a close smooth shave without irritation.&lt;br /&gt;Lock your wrist and don&#x27;t apply pressure just let the blade glide across your skin.&lt;br /&gt;last but not least have patience! shaving this way has a learning curve from holding the razor at the right angle to get a good lather from your shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons- none so far.  I only wish I had always shaved this way.</li>
    <li> are you a man?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;get it. and then shave with it. you&#x27;ll thank yourself. for being awesome. get it. seriously. get it.</li>
    <li> Handle is a bit smaller than anticipated and it&#x27;s not the &amp;#34;butterfly opening&amp;#34; model. Otherwise it&#x27;s a very nice razor</li>
    <li> I received my new safety razor and love it the blades are very cheap to buy and it looks sweet all chromed out just remember to let the blade do the work or you will be bleeding found that out the hard way it was just a habbit from using mach 3 blades the blades cost around 1.80 for 10 at walmart or you can pay 2.30 per blade the edwin jagger cost me 40 dollars but in the long run I&#x27;ll save a ton of money so if you are thinking of something different check out safety razors on you tube it kind of makes shaving fun again like when we started to shave but go slower and no pressure and be careful of the blades just putting them in the razor</li>
    <li> What a beautiful, amazing razor!  The weight and construction give it a solid feel and the balance is perfect.  I am new to wet shaving, and after reading numerous recommendations and suggestions I decided on this razor.  I feel this is a perfect &amp;#34;first razor&amp;#34; it might also be my only razor, unless I decide to pass it on to my son.  It is that nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not thrilled with the &amp;#34;Derby&amp;#34; blades that came with it, but I realize this is very much a matter of personal preference and I had several blade samplers ordered at the same time.  I would recommend you do the same.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent razor. Perfectly crafted, it looks slick. I&#x27;m glad I went with this &amp;#34;lined detail&amp;#34; model rather than the smooth chrome model. It&#x27;s balanced exactly the same and gives a little more grip to the handle. It even looks classier, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of balance, this razor is perfectly weighted. It&#x27;s not too heavy, but with a good blade you won&#x27;t feel the need to press against your face, which is a no-no anyway. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s ideal for medium-sharp to very-sharp blades. So, not the Derby blades that come with it. They&#x27;re really dull, and you&#x27;re going to want to try some other blades. I&#x27;ve listed three good alternatives below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After talking with some friends who have used butterfly-opening razors, I&#x27;m really glad I went for this one instead. It opens easily by unscrewing the handle, which releases from the top two sections, leaving three total chromed pieces and your blade. Simple, elegant, easy to use, and easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using Edwin Jagger&#x27;s Best Badger brush, Edwin Jagger Traditional Shaving Soap (Sandalwood), and Proraso Liquid After Shave Cream (the white stuff, balm-like with no alcohol). I shave down, then angled above the chin, then up, rinsing and lathering between each step. My hair is straight and thick, my skin is medium-fair, and my neck is relatively sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is my review of the blades I&#x27;ve tried. There are a lot of sampler packs on Amazon, but after doing some research I chose to order around 30 each of just a few different blades to try, avoiding all of the lesser-quality &amp;#34;filler&amp;#34;. I&#x27;ll compare here and there to Mach-3 blades since that&#x27;s what I previously used before switching to electric, and now this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, Derby is what is pictured at the time of this review and is what came with my razor. These you can practically rake across your face any way you see fit. They aren&#x27;t very sharp, on par with a Mach-3 that&#x27;s been used a few times. Shaving requires more strokes which leads to more irritation, especially on the neck. That said, I&#x27;d say these are a good blade if you&#x27;re super worried about cutting yourself, because it&#x27;s practically impossible. But even beginners might want to look elsewhere as these blades kind of ruin the &amp;#34;shaving experience&amp;#34;. Don&#x27;t be disappointed if you just bought this razor and have only tried these blades! Keep reading...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered a 100-pack of Astra SP Platinum (that&#x27;s Astra Superior Premium Platinum, not the regular stainless) since it&#x27;s under ten bucks at the time of this writing. These are great. Beginners, start here. They&#x27;re sharp enough that you don&#x27;t have to press the razor against your skin—which you shouldn&#x27;t have to! You&#x27;re supposed to let the weight of your razor do the work as you guide it along your face in short strokes. So naturally, these are sharper than Mach-3 blades, but if you do press a little, you probably won&#x27;t nick yourself. I love these blades because for me, they&#x27;re comfortable enough for everyday use and provide good, close shaves at a very inexpensive price. Easy on my neck with care. My go-to blade. Great for beginners and pros alike, and eligible for Subscribe &amp; Save!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wilkinson Sword Classic seem to be great blades for people who have their technique down pretty well. Compared to Astra SP Platinum, they are sharper. They provided the best shave of the lot, but I did nick myself here and there on my neck and below my chin the first time around. Do not push these blades against your skin. It doesn&#x27;t take much mastery to use these, and they&#x27;re worth working up to. Downside: more than twice the price of Astra SP Platinum. I&#x27;ll keep some of these around for days when I want the closest shave possible, or I just feel like something different. If you&#x27;re new to traditional shaving or think Mach-3 blades are sharp, maybe don&#x27;t start here, but definitely try them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feather &amp;#34;New Hi Stainless&amp;#34; Platinum Coated blades are exactly what the reviews say: sharp. My first shave I got a good amount of nicks, but my second I had almost none. I adapted well, and you have to; each brand is a little different and the best require good technique, but some are more forgiving than others. These are negligibly sharper than the Wilkinson Sword Classic but they aren&#x27;t forgiving at all and I didn&#x27;t achieve any better of a shave. They&#x27;re incredibly sharp compared to a Mach-3 blade. At 2x the price of the aforementioned and more than 3x the price of Astra SP Platinum, I won&#x27;t be keeping these on hand, but your mileage may vary. If you only want the sharpest blade around, this is it. Fun fact: these come ten to a pack instead of five.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I&#x27;m sticking with Astra SP Platinum for regular use and Wilkinson Sword Classic when I&#x27;m up for something sharper. I shave every other day, and either is priced reasonably enough that if I want, I can use each side of a blade just once for a fresh edge every shave. That&#x27;s about a 100-pack every year, so do the maths on price. Of course, both brands last much longer than this if you&#x27;re looking for even better value.s are exactly what the reviews say: sharp. My first shave I got a good amount of nicks, but my second I had almost none. I adapted well, and you have to; each brand is a little different and the best require good technique, but some are more forgiving than others. These are negligibly sharper than the Wilkinson Sword Classic but they aren&#x27;t forgiving at all and I didn&#x27;t achieve any better of a shave. They&#x27;re incredibly sharp compared to a Mach-3 blade. At 2x the price of the aforementioned and more than 3x the price of Astra SP Platinum, I won&#x27;t be keeping these on hand, but your mileage may vary. If you only want the sharpest blade around, this is it.

    <li> This review is more of an advertisement for safety razor wet shaving then a \\&quot;you must buy this razor\\&quot; review.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong the razor is great and nice at twice the price, but if you have done your research you know there are at least a dozen razors like this one in the same price range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this razor as my first DE razor, and I love it (note: I have no other safety razor to compare its performance to.  The razor is beautiful and solidly built, blades are easy to change and fit/finish are excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was worried about wet shaving in general because I have sensitive skin and my neck breaks out when I shave.  I have tried everything from high priced electric razors to disposables 1-5 blades, with no relief from red bumps, itchy skin and ingrown hairs.  Let me tell you I have never, never had a better shave than the one I get with my safety razor.  I hated shaving for all the reasons above and therefore would only do it 2-3 times a week.  In a professional work environment I felt like I came across lazy if I didn&#x27;t shave all the time.  Not only do I love to shave now but I look forward to it and even do it on the weekends when I am not going into the office.  Shaving does take a little longer and you need to pay attention more than shaving with and electric, but I wouldn&#x27;t have it any other way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line try it, you owe it to yourself.</li>
    <li> I bought it as a gift for my son and he loves it. He quit his Parker (gave it to me to try) and has nothing but good stuff to say about his DE89.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful razor. I bought my son one as a gift and he loves it. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> This is my first DE safety Razor and Its terrific! I&#x27;ve got a very difficult beard and have suffered with ingrown hairs my whole life, especially in the areas below my chin. I don&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;densest&amp;#34; beard but I do have VERY thick course hair so even if I try &amp;#34;growing it out&amp;#34;, as many have suggested, in my case that makes it worse because the hair will actually curl back into my skin creating big red bumps everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the De89 for almost 3 weeks now and, although not spotless, I can see a noticeable improvement. I hope with time it gets even better. The first thing I noticed is that its really NOT THAT DIFFICULT to wet shave. I saw so many you tube tutorials I thought it would be a lot trickier that it actually is. My only gripe/adjustment that I need to make is having to change the blades so frequently. With my hair I only get 3 or 4 shaves before needing to switch the blade. On the other hand, I suppose the sharpness of the single blade is the point of razor!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also found that it really helps that this razor doesn&#x27;t cut so &amp;#34;ultra-close&amp;#34; as everything I&#x27;ve used before (electric rotary &amp; foil, multi-blade razors, etc...). I&#x27;m sure that doing several passes I could get it &amp;#34;super clean&amp;#34; if I wanted but, because of the ingrown hair, issue I think its better to leave the stubble a little raised so it won&#x27;t sink under the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even putting the ingrown hair issues aside, the razor feels great! The weight is solid and I actually enjoy the little extra time it takes to wet shave. As my first DE Razor its excellent and I would recommend this model to anyone who is thinking of giving it a try.</li>
    <li> Tried using this razor and I could not get a close shave. I used a good quality shaving cream and tried different angles but inevitably I had to return to my cartridge razor with gilette trac 2 blades.</li>
    <li> This is the &amp;#34;gold standard&amp;#34; for starter razors when getting into DE Shaving.  This razor is solid and well-finished.  It&#x27;s a tad mild for me, now that I have been DE shaving for a while.  Hard to go wrong with this razor.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t believe I waited so long to move to a double edge razor. Great weight. grip and size</li>
    <li> For years and years I&#x27;ve used the Gillette 2 razor disposables from Costco... yeah, the pack of 30-ish. I always dreaded shaving because although my facial hair looks like a stubby/coarse \\&quot;5 o&#x27;clock shadow\\&quot; after nearly a week, it hurts to shave at that point with the disposables because it feels as if it pulls the hair out. After trying out my friends with a new Derby blade installed, WOAH what a difference. After doing a bit of research, it seems majority are really happy with the Astra Superior Platinums (100pk) and so I decided to go with those as well and couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> I grew up with only a single or double edge razor. None of the disposable or multi razor system of today. This is a great razor. Comfortable in my hand and well balanced. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Was using a Parker before this. This unit gives a much closer shave atleast for me. I use only magic shave oil and it works fantastic.</li>
    <li> Nice construction, solid.</li>
    <li> Love this razor.  Have used 3 or 4 types of blades and only 1 of them gave me any razor burn, so it was the blade, not the razor.  Going to the safety razor has allowed me to shave every day again- something I couldn&#x27;t do with the disposables (without a terrible irritation).&lt;br /&gt;Invest in a good soap too.  Makes all the difference in the world to how your face feels!</li>
    <li> After a year of using this razor I am very happy with the way it shaves. It looks great and still shines like new. Using it is great and very comfortable to use.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t compare this to the other popular brand, but this one works and chrome seems nice and thick. Been decades since I used a double edge blade and forgot how difficult it is to see when I get up next to my beard on my neck. I&#x27;ve had a beard for 40 yrs and was just wondering this morning what it might be like to use &amp; keep a straight edge razor sharp at home, cause this big clunky thing is too hard for my old eyes to see where to stop on my neck, next to my beard. It&#x27;s gonna suck if I have to get another pack of cheap throwaway razors just to do my beard line, right! I wonder how are others getting around this. ??</li>
    <li> I guess I am not the most credible person to write a shining review of this razor as my only real comparison was the nationally advertised MicroTouch One which in and of itself is not a horrible razor but its WORLDS behind this one.  I got BBS (Baby Butt Smooth) with 3 passes and some touch up on my problem areas with no irritation.  The build quality seems pretty good.  Feels very solid in the hand and even wet I did not lose my grip on it.  The weight and balance of it is good and I had a wonderful shave with it last night using a Feather blade.  I have some Derby/Wilkinson Sword/and Persona blades to try out but pair this with a feather and you are going to get a good mild comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> Very nice razor for someone new to wet shaving. I like the feel of it in my hand.</li>
    <li> Came exactly as described, happy with purchase</li>
    <li> this is the best razor I have ever owned the quality of this razor is unbelievable</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the razor for one year. I&#x27;ve used everyday. I only own this one razor. Chrome is still as beautiful as the day I got it. I&#x27;ve traveled quite a bit with it too. Good balanced feel and looks great in the holder. Very good shave. The Persona in blue box is my favorite, but Feather, Astra and Sharks all work very well. I&#x27;ve had no problem with the handle being slippery. I could see this as a problem if you were holding the handle toward the bottom like using a regular razor. You should be holding the handle much higher for a DE.  Hope this will be the only razor I will ever need for the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> First I like to say this is a QUALITY made item. The shave is great, nice comb groves to allows blade to have enough soap to cut without razor skin burn. The blade fits perfect in the guides without misalignment concerns.&lt;br /&gt;This and my Merkur 34c are my favorite out of my 7 DE razors. Weight is 2.6 oz handle 3 ½&amp;#34;. Nice weight balance and handling. You can use a feather blade without niches and burns. You won&#x27;t go wrong with this razor and I&#x27;m sure it will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;After shaving, of course you want to disassemble any DE razor to clean and dry, so not to get water minerals built up on it, that would cause future uncomfortable shavings, and prolong blade life. Don&#x27;t forget to flip the blade after drying.</li>
    <li> Be a man.  Do it right.  Plus I use a sharp new blade every day for 2.5 cents per side.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve been using Gillette fusion for years. This is a way better shave. It&#x27;s cheaper in the long run as well. The blade doesn&#x27;t get clogged up by moderately long hair. In fact. It doesn&#x27;t really get clogged at all. I shaved my chest with it to test it&#x27;s capabilities and it was awesome. Ez shave cut all the hair in one stroke. I bought the merkur long handle just before this. It wasnt as well built. The handle was hollow, it was built with a two piece design that came apart. The Edwin jagger is one solid piece. Sturdy strong thick and better manufactured in my opinion. I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I have both this Edwin Jagger DE89Lbl and the Merkur Heavy Duty #34 .  They are both great safety razors.  The Merkur is a two piece design.  The Jagger is a three piece design.  I personally prefer the German two piece design over the English three piece design.  I think the Jagger manufacturing quality is slightly better than the Merkur.</li>
    <li> My husband has a shave set that he bought without the razor, and I gifted this to him since it was on his wish list. The actual razor is pretty bad, in his opinion. Mostly he has is on the stand just for show, while he uses another brand of razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a convert.  I have been using this for about two weeks and love it.  Very short learning curve to adjust to technique.  Somehow both more comfortable and closer shave in a more affordable and more attractive package. Make sure you get a high quality brush as well and take your time.  Shaving went from my least favorite part of the morning routine to something I look forward to.</li>
    <li> Great razor, the handle is slightly smaller than I was used to but is easy to use.  Weighted nicely as well.  As others have noted it is not meant to be a fast shave razor.</li>
    <li> As long as the blades are good on this then my husband is happy with it.  It gives him a nice, clean cut and he says this is MUCH better than the disposable type.</li>
    <li> Like so many I had been using cartridges to shave with. I had considered making the switch for a DE razor for a while  and decided to place an order. My wife told me to just be patient. It turns out her father ordered one of the infomercial razors. I used it for a year and decided to order this razor. I am delighted I did. This is a very nice razor. The machining, plating and fit and finish are all top shelf. The weight of the head for me is just about perfect. I get a closer shave with this than my previous razor. This came with a 5pack of Derby blades to get you started. These blades for me did not work out quite so good. They began tugging on my whiskers after only the second shave. The razor itself is very good though. If you are thinking about this razor, do yourself a favor and just order it. I think you will be glad you did.</li>
    <li> The product itself will arrive in a handsome package and that&#x27;s worth mentioning but most of us will quickly discard it and dive on in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inside this package in a great razor. If you are pricing these out and comparing brands you should know that Edwin Jagger is a trusted brand often recommended to those starting out. Why? It&#x27;s not overly aggressive as others can be. From my perspective that is the only reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing you may hear a lot of is &amp;#34;Your mileage may vary&amp;#34; (YMMV). Different gents get different results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an easy to assemble/disassemble when you are changing blades. Just twist the handle and the unit comes apart. It&#x27;s three pieces and there isn&#x27;t much room for error or malfunction. It looks sleek and has an overall good weight to it. Remember if you are just starting out let the weight of the razor carry you through your shave. Cartridges may have you pressing down. No need here. Pop in a good blade and get started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A quality product that should last you &amp;#34;forever&amp;#34; (YMMV)</li>
    <li> I started with a Merkur razor, and was quite happy with it. However the Edwin Jagger beats the Merkur razor in most regards. My only complaint is that the handle is hollow, where as my Merkur was solid metal. On the other hand, the Edwin Jagger is so well polished, and the Merkur is only polished on the highly visible parts. I now have two very good razors, after a horrible mishap with a Parker. I tend to use this one the most. Buy it!</li>
    <li> Nice shave.  The head unscrews (in 3 pieces) to replace the blade, just loosen it to clean under running water. A little more care to replace and clean the blade, compared to a clamshell design.  The handle is a little slippery when wet.  I never nicked myself using the first (self supplied)  blade.  Includes 5 blades.  Seems to shave a little nicer then my clamshell style.</li>
    <li> Razor is sharp looking, and works like a champ.  The hubby likes the chrome on the razor, the weight, and the handle length.  He says it&#x27;s easy on the skin, and is glad he purchased this razor.      UPDATE:  Although my husband really liked how this razor shaved, he wasn&#x27;t loving the short handle, especially once it slipped out of his hand a time or two.  He still does use this, and still stands behind the product, but it&#x27;s no longer his go to razor.  If you&#x27;re someone who has larger hands (my husband is 6&#x27;4), you may like a long handled razor better.</li>
    <li> Ok so i ordered my first Edwin Jagger DE89 yesterday night around 10 o clock pm, and got it the next day at 6 o clock pm !!! Amazing service and the delivery was very fast! it looks better than i had imagined, the Chrome looks so luxurious and classy and shaves like a champ,100xs better than any disposable razor, i&#x27;ve been wanting to get one for so long,my grandfather had one and i used to use it sometimes, but i didn&#x27;t know were to purchase it he had bought it so long ago lol, i looked every were and no luck. then checked Amazon and YUP i found it. i feel bad for the people who don&#x27;t know about this old school stuff.much more better then these \\&quot;new\\&quot; Gillete Fusion Bullcrap, every week i had to buy a new disposable razor but this is gonna last a life time with the acception of buying 50 cent Double edge razors lol no bigggy, better then those 12 to 15 dollar cartridges. I HIGHLY recommend this product,i know it gets hard to decide which one to get because there are so many to choose from but this one is perfect the price is not to high and not to low so you know its not a cheap product, the size is perfect for shaving fits perfectly in the hand it has a nice grip on it, it looks AMAZING and the 5 blades that come with it are a very good addition, beginner or not it&#x27;s the one to get if your looking for something in the 30 to 50 dollar price range. your getting back what you put in trust me. overall 5 out of 5 stars get it you won&#x27;t be disappointed .</li>
    <li> My favorite razor. Absolutely the best!</li>
    <li> Great item - a gift for my brother.  He loves it.  Super quality, great product.  You will not regret getting this item!!!!</li>
    <li> Shave was nice while it lasted. After a few shaves the Shaver would not screw back together not worth buying again.</li>
    <li> Amazing razor!! Switched from gillete fusion to edwin jagger; the results are fantastic. No more irritations, very close shave. It is not as intimidating as it looks, it is a highly forgiving razor. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a cost efficient, promising shave.</li>
    <li> Bought as a replacement for a 1958 Gillette Fatboy that was my grandfather&#x27;s. The fixed blade is equivalent to a setting of 3 or 4 on the adjustable Gillette razor. I&#x27;ve been using for about a year. Feather blades work best, the Derby blades it comes with drag too much.</li>
    <li> Should not ever rust for any reason. This should be the last razor you will ever purchase, and of course Amazon carries a lot of different kinds of razor blades . I really like it .</li>
    <li> Quality Razor with an attention to detail in the chroming, performance is superb with a nice weight and design. This is the ultimate starter brush for somebody wanting to get into DE shaving; for the price there is no better razor.</li>
    <li> I will NEVER go back to a disposable blade again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received many warnings about how I will have invest heavily into bandages as the single blades will cut my skin. I have been using this safety razor holder for about a year and love it. I use it along with the Astra Premium Platinum Double Edge blades. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001QY8QXM/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fit and feel of the DE89Lbl is perfect in my hand and allows great control of my shave. I use a 100 % badger shaving brush to apply the soap and get a smooth clean shave. In a rush I can even dry shave with this razor and get a perfect knick free shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The upfront cost of the razor and blades may be a little more than a Gillette quarto set but the disposables don&#x27;t have a chance. One double edge safety blade lasts me about two weeks making the box of 100 good for about 4 years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will have to purchase one for my son soon as he is getting ready to start shaving and it will be a razor that will last him a lifetime.</li>
    <li> If its not my Merkur 34 I&#x27;m going for its this one. I have the best 2 razors on the market. Well made, nice finish. Can not go wrong with this one.</li>
    <li> This is the second safety razor I&#x27;ve tried and it is a real winner.  The other was a Parker 96R which is fairly aggressive and not as good an everyday shaver for me, but hey at least I can still use that one to get that tiny bit under the nose that this one doesn&#x27;t reach very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The DE89Lbl is not aggressive at all and I would recommend it to anyone starting out.  Irritation is minimal for me and nicks are non-existent with any blade I&#x27;ve used in it except the Feather blades. Be sure to read up on proper technique but this razor is certainly more tolerant of errors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the good razors have pluses and minuses, for this one it would be time.  I&#x27;ve found that it takes another two passes to get the level of smoothness that I was getting with the 96R but the lack of irritation makes it worth it for me. Maybe my preference will change over time as I get more adept at shaving this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The construction and finish were great. This razor is certainly great looking if that means anything to you</li>
    <li> Razor arrived ahead of schedule so that was awesome.  As many others have mentioned, the chrome on this is amazing! Edwin Jagger definitely takes pride in producing a quality product.&lt;br /&gt;So far the shave has been pretty good but I expect better results when my technique improves. I haven&#x27;t nicked myself yet so I can shave with a little more confidence in the future. I was worried I&#x27;d filet myself when I used it the first few times. (I&#x27;ve always used a cartridge razor ). If any one reading this has the same concern, don&#x27;t worry. As long as you lather up real good, let the razor do the work &amp; use the correct angle you&#x27;ll be fine.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Great starter safety razor, very mild shave. Great for learning technique  it looks amazing and the build quality is excellent. With that said, after you are more experienced with wet shaving i think most people would prefer a more aggressive razor i own 3 safety razors 2 which are more aggressive and i still enjoy shaving with de89.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor for a little less than a year. It has performed well and I have been very pleased with it. Until today. I changed the blade and as I screwed the top to the handle the peg screw attached to the top of the razor broke off. Looks as if the weld broke. I don&#x27;t believe I was overtightening. The razor has been well cared for. I would have thought it was made of stronger stuff. I will buy another brand.</li>
    <li> Wow! This DE razor is awesome! My 1st purchase. I decided based on reviews and looks. This razor is great. It&#x27;s chrome plated; real nice shine to it. The weight is heavy. I expected a lot lighter, but that&#x27;s not an issue. The razor is a 3 peice. It unscrews on the top neck area and simple to remove. The razor comes with a pack of 5 derby DE razor blades. This razor is very nice. I tried it as soon as I bought it. Managed to not chop my face up. Really wasn&#x27;t that difficult to use. Youtube helped a lot. If you&#x27;re looking into saving money and getting an amazingly clean shave, GET THIS ONE! I highly recommend ditching the fusion 10 blade dyson vibrator blades. This is all you need. I plan on purchasing many more to add to the collection.</li>
    <li> I wish I got the longer handle version, but the weigh on this is fantastic. First few tries nicked myself and my face was all bloodied but now i shave smooth and soft everytime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is not for pussies.</li>
    <li> The handle is a bit small but besides that great product.</li>
    <li> As many of people who get DE safety razor I did it mostly to save money; spend $20 every other month just in cartridges always make me somewhat uncomfortable. Finally I decided to check for options, the best option for me was to get a safety razor. Doing some research I end up getting this one, apparently is a good one to learn as to keep, there are some ones that are very &amp;#34;forgiving&amp;#34; but lack the ability to do a real close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also bought a cheap kit with a boar brush, soap and bowl for 10 bucks, http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001A3HPT0/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1 I really recommend to also buy a kit of sample blades. This safety razor comes with 5 derby blades which are probably the best ones or at least the ones I like the most, however everybody have different kind of skin and preferences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first shaves where just awfull, I got a very bad razor burns, ingrown hair I cut myself a few times. That&#x27;s why I recommend to watch some videos of how to do it properly; if you are like me, a person that has used disposable razor for all your life you will finally understand all those shaving references of end up with a ton of toilet paper in the face. After watching some videos and reading some advice I end up with a list of things to have in consideration&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Preparation of razor, soap and face&lt;br /&gt;* How to correctly handle the razor&lt;br /&gt;* Do a proper lather&lt;br /&gt;* Find the best order to razor, in my case with the grain, cross the grain and finally against the grain.&lt;br /&gt;* After shaving, cold water and some good cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gotta say, after my initial learning curve I must to say that I really enjoy to shave, its a complete process that I even look forward for it. Something to keep in mind is that it takes some time, I used to last 2 o 3 minutes for a fast shave with my old mach 3. Now I dedicate 10-20 minutes to get a very close and nice shave. Having this said if you are expecting to do it on rush you may end up with bloody results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: It fell from 2 feets and the head broke, come on, really?h you may end up with bloody results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: It fell from 2 feets and the head broke, come on, really?</li>
    <li> Never, EVER going back to anything else. Mach 3, Fusion, 7-bladed monstrosities are all a complete rip-off. This shaves just as well, if not better (once you are past the initial learning curve), and a 100-pack of blades are FAR cheaper than replacement cartridges for said monstrosities. Smooth, clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!!!</li>
    <li> Probably the best close shave I have ever had, just remember to take your time and let the weight of the razor do the work for you.</li>
    <li> the razor works perfectly with no alignment issues and doesn&#x27;t wiggle itself apart. the blade and is easy to assemble/disassemble. the 3 piece design makes it much easier to clean and remove soap scum than a 2 piece or 1 piece design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall would recomend for anyone trying to buy their first de razor</li>
    <li> From this manufacturer you would expect a strong product. You&#x27;ll be disappointed. One three-foot drop to the floor broke it, revealing what it&#x27;s made of, which is obviously not pure metal. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Great razor for the price, using Personna blues with great results. Never going back to triple blades! I&#x27;m also using this with Proraso shaving cream, and a pure badger brush.</li>
    <li> WORKS GREAT !! TOOK SOME GETTING USED TO SWITCHING FROM A MACH III BUT WATCHED A COUPLE YOUTUBE VIDEOS AND NOW I AM A PRO !!!</li>
    <li> The biggest negative of this razor is the length of the handle. Everything else is great but beware as it is hard to hold onto. Also, you will need to pick up some small washers to put on it so you will keep the head from moving after a few pulls.</li>
    <li> I bought the Edwin Jagger Lined DE razor as my introduction to wet shaving. The razor has by far surpassed my expectations. It has a solid weight and is well constructed. The head twists off easily for simple blade replacement. The ridges on the handle also help with grip. While I had contemplated buying a razor with a longer handle, I&#x27;m happy with this razor&#x27;s length. It fits perfectly in my average sized hands and fits nicely on the Escali Deluxe Chrome stand I also purchased. As a new wet shaver I found the included blades to be fine for starting. Overall, been over a month since I bought this razor and I would highly recommend it as a good value for quality and price to any new wet shaver out there. Been a nice transition from my former Mach razors.</li>
    <li> Very good razor. Not too aggressive. I like the derby blades that come with the razor. I have since changed blades to the feather brand. They seem even sharper. I have also joined The Wet Shave Club. The club mails out samples of blades, soaps and oils every month. Your first month you get a standard box that includes a razor ( looks like it&#x27;s a Merkur  that competes with this one) 2 different kinds of blades (10 total) 2 hard soap samples and alum matches. This is not an ad for them but I do enjoy trying a lot of different brands and products. This razor has helped turn a chore into something I look forward too. I really could not believe how relaxing shaving would become.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m no shaving expert, but this is a huge step up for me from a few vintage Gillette DE razor. This razor is more forgiving than most any other DE razor I&#x27;ve used and I get a better shave than most fancy disposables, if I do my part. Personna &#x27;blues&#x27; and Gillette 7 O&#x27;Clock &#x27;greens&#x27; are my favorites for an irritation free shave. Astra or Feather if i want a closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost a year later and there is no corrosion or quality issue. Rinse well because getting built up cream/hair out requires disassembly once it dries.</li>
    <li> Flawless chrome finish.  Nice weight.  This is my first safety razor and I have had no problems getting use to it. If you are new to safety razors, watch a video before using to get some tips.  Short strokes and using a really wet lather make things very comfortable.  For this razor, you unscrew the head and disassemble to install the blade.  I think that having a pop-open design (the kind that telescopes open when you unscrew it) would be slightly easier/faster.  I think the shave is definitely closer than your typical multi-blade razors.  I bought a 100 pack of the Personna Double Edge blades, so at 13 cents per blade, you can&#x27;t beat it.  I&#x27;m on my 4th day with the same blade and it still feels great.</li>
    <li> Recently switched from the multi-blades and recalling how I used to shave many years ago. Don&#x27;t know why I ever left. Have to do it (shave) differently as it&#x27;s not like using the multi-blades but so much easier, I can really keep these blades clean and free from build up PLUS- the blades seem to shave cleaning with less work AND last longer. Sorry it took this long to go back!!!&lt;br /&gt;Wish I&#x27;d done it years ago...</li>
    <li> On par with the finest tools I own. Form that go&#x27;s beyond function. I suppose if I continue to care for it like it deserves that it live out last me.</li>
    <li> This is the first DE razor I purchased and owned. It&#x27;s shiny, has a good weight on it, and provides a good shave. For about the month I owned it, I enjoyed shaving with it until I inadvertently knocked it on the floor from my bathroom sink counter(about 3.5 ft high) and broke it where the handle and head join. I contacted Edwin Jagger about it, and they said they could not provide me with a replacement head or new razor because it was an accident and gave me the link to a seller of replacement heads. Apparently, this is a common problem with this razor. A quick search can provide you with more information. I like the look and feel of it, but I would/did not purchase another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two stars for its weakness.</li>
    <li> Best razor on the market.</li>
    <li> I recently switched from disposable three blade razors to shaving with this excellent razor and love it!! I get a very nice close shave and less irritation. The learning curve for me was really low, I had a nick or two the first time. The razor is nice and heavy and very beautiful. It feels great on the face when warmed up with hot water. I use it with astra blades and porasso shaving cream in the tube. I&#x27;ll never go back to the expensive multiple blade razors.</li>
    <li> The head broke off after only about two months of use. I have a Mekur model and it has lasted several years so far... I would recommend that one, and it&#x27;s about $5 less</li>
    <li> THIS EDWIN JAGGER DE89LBL IS BEUTIFUL... Lots of people mention that this is a nice heavy razor. The weight of this razor is nice, it feels more solidly built. I don&#x27;t know if that is what really gave me a better shave, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the angle at which this razor holds the blade is much nicer than the cheap razor. The head essentially bends the blade slightly downward, which gives you a better shaving angle, a smoother shave, and also seems to be better on blade wear. The cheaper razor doesn&#x27;t have quite as steep an angle, which made it a bit tougher on my face and I seemed to go through blades more quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I am glad I spent the money on this razor. It provides a really nice smooth shave that has me hooked. The cheap razor will serve nicely as a backup or a travel razor, but this one deserves to be used every day.</li>
    <li> My replacement razor for the ultra-expensive Gillette razors (Fusion Pro-Glide).  Very happy with the sturdy, galvanized stainless finish.  Pack of razors costs between $1.49 - $3.50.</li>
    <li> This razor was very impressive its super high quality nice and heavy and the chrome finish is perfect. It was very easy to get a nice close comfortable shave with the razor.</li>
    <li> Super recomendada, muy buena calidad, el cromado el peso y el dise&amp;ntilde;o son muy buenos, es c&amp;oacute;moda para manejarla incluso si tiene las manos grandes, da una afeitada muy muy arras y deja la piel suave lista para el after shave, la recomiendo la mejor afeitadora de la historia.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and we love it.  He was shaving with a single blade disposable razor prior to using the Edwin Jagger razor so it was as easy transition for him.  I was tired of buying the disposable razors.  With this razor, he replaces the blade and we recycle the blade.  I&#x27;ve tried it and I plan on getting a similar one.  The only thing is that the handle on this one is very short.  I would recommend getting one with a longer handle.</li>
    <li> When it comes to shaving, it should be approached with the respect it deserves. After all, you&#x27;re putting a blade to your face. So why use a four bladed, plastic handled contraption that&#x27;s built to be tossed out every week? Why not buy the best tool you can and use it to start your day off right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to using this beautiful chrome and steel tool for the rest of my life. And if it makes my day even 1% better, it will be more than worth the few dollars it costs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: It&#x27;s been about a week now, and I&#x27;ve gone through all the Derby blades that came with this razor. I was slightly disappointed by the irritation I was getting on my neck, and I fortunately ordered the Feather blades everyone seems to be impressed with. I just used my first one and I agree - the Feather blades are WAAAAAAY better. No dragging or skipping on my face, and much less irritation. I&#x27;m not going back to Derby&#x27;s. The razor itself is still seeming like a great purchase though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: It&#x27;s been about 5 years since I&#x27;ve bought this razor and I haven&#x27;t once considered going back to disposables. I&#x27;ve evolved from scared 1st timer (didn&#x27;t want to slice my face off) to intermediate &amp;#34;pretty good&amp;#34; shaves to now - I do a up/down/left/right shave every morning without damaging my face and I come away with absolutely smooth skin. The razor blades seem important at first but now I can pick up any blade, leave it in the handle for a week, and barely even notice the difference between it and a brand new Feather blade (which are great btw). I imagine most guys will go through a similar process if they decide to start using a safety razor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, the savings in blades vs disposables has paid for this handle many times over by now. And the quality of the shave is just as good/better (after going through the learning process) than a disposable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TLDR: After 5 years of daily use, I would recommend every guy make the switch to real razors instead of disposables. Both to save money, but also to be a little more of a &amp;#34;real man&amp;#34; instead of a sucker.</li>
    <li> This really is a very good razor and it is easy to recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do think it positions the blade angle a bit on the &#x27;safe&#x27; side, which is why it is viewed as a good razor for beginners. For some this is likely a benefit, for others not so much. For me it was a small negative until i found a work-around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have gotten into the habit of loosening the handle (just to the point where the head will not spin easily) for the last shaving pass. This seems to let the blade spring into a slightly more aggressive angle and helps me get the proverbial baby-smooth shave. Anyone interested might try that out for themselves.</li>
    <li> Nice, solid razor. It is not a clamshell or butterfly design, like my old Gillette safety razor, but it is solid and well-balanced.</li>
    <li> I was iffy about buying one without having a chance to hold it in my hand. I like the weight , the handle size is just right for my hands ( size 14 pointer finger) .The build quality is spot on... I&#x27;m officially addicted</li>
    <li> After much research, I decided to go with the Edwin Jagger DE89 and man it is really nice. Great weight, beautiful finish, and the handle for me is perfect length. I am very happy with this purchase and I so look forward to shaving with my new Parker Silver back brush and Taylor of Bond St soap.</li>
    <li> Perfect weight and size. Gorgeous finish and looks much more expensive than it actually is. Best safety razor I&#x27;ve had yet!</li>
    <li> Well I have to admit it is a little strange getting used to at first, but once you get used to it after just a few shaves you realize how easy and safe it is.  I&#x27;ve been a Gillette owner all my life so that is probably why it was a little different than what I&#x27;m used to, but with the replacement blades being sooo cheap I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever go back to using a Gillette razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Edwin Jagger mostly in the shower with a mirror for the last 2-3 months and it still looks new.&lt;br /&gt;My wife has even been using it to shave her legs and she also enjoys it and with the blades so affordable, I can replace them more often and still land up with it being cheaper than the Gillette blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend this and may even be getting this for the men in my family for Christmas gifts.</li>
    <li> This safety razor is perfect in every way.  Absolutely love it.  Excellent shave when paired with Feather brand razors.  Also very easy to clean and maintain.  Besides that, if you care, the razor looks very good too!</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite DE Razor. It&#x27;s better than the Merkurs in my opinion. Simple, nice looking, functional, smooth shave, just brilliant. Thank you, Jagger!!!</li>
    <li> If there were 6 stars I&#x27;d give it that..very well built razor, fit and finish are perfect.. The quality of the chrome is flawless.. I have a medium beard and generally shave every day, but I&#x27;ve gone 4 days before and had a long tough beard at that point, the DE89 took it right off in two passes, three passes made me good as new.. The razor is aggressive enough and perfect choice for those like me who shave mostly daily,, however I think a Merker with a comb would work better for those who often skip a day or two and have heavy beards.. The Merkers are great razors too, but the fit and finish earn&#x27;t quite as nice.. I highly recommend..</li>
    <li> Love the finish, the handle design an all. Very easy learning curve for me (maybe it was because of my steady hands?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Rolls-Royce chrome style looks great!</li>
    <li> The razor is of great quality but paired with not so great derby blades. The blades work well in Merkur razors but from my experience and many others a good starting point blade for this razor is the Astra super platinum&#x27;s. Shipping was fast and in good condition when I received it.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Quality construction&lt;br /&gt;- Visually appealing&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;- Comes with a 5 pack of good blades&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Handle is a bit short&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great purchase. This works FAR better than any Gillette product and is 1/10000000th the price for blades.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been DE shaving for about 3 months before I took the plunge on this razor after just using a Lord L6 for a while. BIG DIFFERENCE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s much smoother in sitting on your face and the blades sit alot closer to the guards allowing you to shave with more confidence of not putting the wrong angle down. It has a great weight to it so you do not feel like you are constantly having to push down on it even just a little to feel the cut. Also, it is quite small and stubby, so if your hands are extremely freaky big, it would be a problem but otherwise just use your fingertips like usual and enjoy!</li>
    <li> My self described &amp;#34;persnickety&amp;#34; boyfriend loved this gift - the design, the fact that it will save him money &amp; reduce waste, and it&#x27;s 5 star performance. I thought he would end up cutting himself until he learned how to  use it, but the learning curve was much shorter than I anticipated. In fact, he didn&#x27;t cut himself once. He is very hard to find a gift for but congratulated me on this find.</li>
    <li> Love my Edwin Jagger razor.  It is a perfectly balanced razor and it&#x27;s gorgeous to look at as well.</li>
    <li> I hated shaving.  I got to where I only shaved on Sunday.  This provided me with a shave that would look nice in the early part of the week, and by Friday I was \\&quot;fashionably\\&quot; unshaven.  I actually liked that it was in style to have a three to four day beard.  Worked for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went from a disposable to Mach 3 and then to the newer (and battery powered) Fusion, with five blades!  My shaves were not that great, and not very comfortable.  And yes, I used various \\&quot;gooes\\&quot; in a way of cream out of a can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day I somehow stumbled upon looking at double edge razors on Amazon, and reading all the reviews.  I decided to see what all the fuss was about, all these fabulous reviews!  So I order the Edwin Jagger De89lbl, a badger brush, Porasso shaving soap, and Nevia Ice aftershave, for a start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I ordered all of this, I later had buyer&#x27;s remorse.  I thought that I might have just wasted my money.  I thought of getting back online to see if I could cancel, but then I remembered all the positive reviews, and thought: \\&quot;It&#x27;s worth a try.\\&quot;  I think I was also curious to see for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received my new razor and other items.  I shaved yesterday, first time with this new \\&quot;system\\&quot;.  All I can say is WOW.  Boy am I glad I didn&#x27;t cancel the order!  I hardly have any beard at this time, after yesterdays close and COMFORTABLE shave, but I&#x27;m already wanting to shave again.  What a great shave!  Now I&#x27;m looking forward to my next shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely five stars and worth the money and experience.  I still have several Fusion blades which I&#x27;ll keep for when the time may arise to use them.</li>
    <li> My first DE Razor.  Beautiful finish, perfect size for me at any rate.  Excellent value.  Paired with Feather brand blades.  The razor and 50 blades were still less expensive than an 8 pack of Gillette 5 blade cartridges at the supermarket</li>
    <li> I wish more people knew about this classic style of shaving. I have a thick beard and am fed up with cartridges. This is the best razor I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Had a competitor kit and got this also.  Since i&#x27;ve received this, I have not used any other razor handle.  the blades i&#x27;ve used plenty and seem to like the Astra and Bluebird, though you may like something different.</li>
    <li> Very Classy! I bought this razor set and was impress with the intricate chrome finish and its nice weight! I always take out the razor blade after each shave and wash the razor set with warm water and dry it properly and store it! I definitely cherished it! Great Gift!</li>
    <li> I have tried other razors, even ones that cost significantly more, and this is by far the smoothest and most forgiving one. While this razor doesn&#x27;t cut you with every mistake you may make, it is still capable of giving you a BBS shave any day of the week. Buy it.</li>
    <li> Many communities consider the De89lbl to be one of the most popular DE razors on the market, and for good reason. This razor is well built, comfortably weighted and very smooth to use. This is my first DE razor, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever outgrow it as my experience increases. The included Derby blades are not bad at all, but one should certainly pick up a sampler pack as well to determine which blade works the best for them. They can be found here on Amazon for excellent prices.</li>
    <li> Love it, was not long handled as described but is still good.</li>
    <li> This is a medium aggressive razor gives a really close shave.  It is great for beginner DE shavers because it can give a good shave while still being pretty easy to use and learn.  It has really good balance, and I really like the weight of it.  That is more of a personal preference obviously.  It is a classic 3 piece design that is really easy to clean and change blades (just don&#x27;t crank down on the threads or you could strip them).  Of course, E.J. is a really well respected company that has a history of making good products, which always makes buying easier.  The blades that are included aren&#x27;t great, so you may want to get some good blades at the same time as the razor.</li>
    <li> 6 months in, I can say this is a beautifully-made razor.  Heavy.  The handle length is satisfactory for someone coming from a Mach3 / Fusion background.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only concern is that it looks like corrosion is developing on the handle screw already.  I&#x27;m fastidious about rinsing the razor and letting it dry between uses, but I absolutely refuse to disassemble the head between shavings; if that&#x27;s what&#x27;s required for longevity of the screw stud, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll be pleased down the road.</li>
    <li> Love it. It&#x27;s my first one and I have no complaints</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, seems to be a well made product.</li>
    <li> Used 1 time.  Razor fell off of stand onto counter and the head screw broke into two parts.  Do not buy this item.  It will break if it gets dropped even a few inches.  The head screw is 100% faulty.  I purchase because there were so many reviews.  Didn&#x27;t think much about the 1 star reviews until mine broke and now I understand.  Heed the warning.</li>
    <li> Glad I did the research and settled on this razor. It looks awesome, but more importantly is gives a very nice shave with little to no irritation. I have been using the included Derby blades, but will now be switching to the Israeli Personna&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Great, with the exception of the handle being very slippery with the groves going the wrong way.  Can&#x27;t complain otherwise though.</li>
    <li> For me it&#x27;s an excellent DE razor. It&#x27;s manly and puts me back in time . I can&#x27;t not help thinking  about  my dad shaving every morning.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned two double edge razors and shaved with three. This has to be the best built of all of these razors. The finish is very nice. It&#x27;s more aggressive than the Parker 99R, which I enjoy. However, the handle on this razor is shorter than the Parker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless, a nice razor.</li>
    <li> Hands down the best razor I have ever used. I don&#x27;t shave with cream or soaps so this is the smoothest shave for me. Heat up your face and the blade and it simply glides with no issues.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent razor. Comfortable handling and beautifully made. I just wonder what &#x27;Lbl&#x27; means? My best guess is &#x27;Long Barrel Lined&#x27;.</li>
    <li> I bought this item a year ago and still work great! I am very pleased with the performance of this  razor. - Update: got broken after 4 years of use</li>
    <li> Do it and save some money.</li>
    <li> This is my first double edge safer razor and it has not disappointed!  This razor has just the right length and weight for my hand and has made learning to share with a DE very pleasurable.  For those looking for their first DE, I highly recommend this razor as it is not too aggressive.  Once you learn to shave with a DE you will NOT go back to those expensive cartridge razors.</li>
    <li> Good piece of Razer..</li>
    <li> This razor has a nice weight to it and as soon as I learn to use it correctly I am sure I will stop cutting myself! : )</li>
    <li> Fantastic Razor. Not only does it have a sleek look, but it is entirely functional as well. This is a three piece safety razor and the angle is just right. The weight is very well-balanced too, which makes for a much easier shave. If you are thinking about making the switch from disposable razors, or just looking for a new functional safety razor, this is your answer.</li>
