<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this one for a friend. almost kept it for myself, as the only thing wrong with my ej89 (i have the black handle) is the handle can be a little slippery.</li>
    <li> Great product but I went ahead and ordered the standard length Jagger razor as well. I think my hands are a little big for the Kelvin model.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using my Edwin Jagger Kelvin (EJ89 model) for over a month now, and I think this is a great double-edge safety razor for beginners.  It is a mild razor that is pretty forgiving to newbies that are still learning the technique of shaving with a double-edge blade.  You can still manage to slice yourself if you aren&#x27;t careful, but it is a lot more forgiving than other razors on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor has a shorter handle than normal EJ89 and Merkur razors, but I actually like it.  It seems to fit well in my hand, and it looks great!  The bright shiny nature of the razor is attractive on the counter, and I like the aesthetics of the razor handle.  The knurling on the handle also provides a good grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rated this razor down a star because I don&#x27;t think this is one that would last a lifetime like a vintage Gillette razor.  This is because the razor is made from a lower grade metal, and just coated with a nice chrome finish.  From my understanding, the chrome plating will eventually breakdown, and once exposed, the underlying metal won&#x27;t hold up like brass or stainless steel razors would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the &amp;#34;Badger &amp; Blade&amp;#34; site if you are looking for more information on wet shaving and all the different hardware and software one can use for shaving.</li>
    <li> My first Double Edge Razor and will be my last. I love it. Stupid easy to use. Can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve been paying out the rear end for Mach 3/Fusion safety razors my whole life when I could have been getting a better shave for pennies on the dollar.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband (shorter handles for guys and longer handle for ladies). We both shave with Edwin Jagger safety razors and we love our razors!! You can feel the quality and the angle is perfect causing no irritation! Closest, smoothest shave with this razor! My husband loves how the handle has some grip.</li>
    <li> Good razor but buy better blades. The ones that come with it are not good.</li>
    <li> GET ONE WHILE YOU CAN  A GREAT RAZOR</li>
    <li> This razor has become my daily choice, I really like the short handle.</li>
    <li> I requested and received this wonderful DE safety razor as a gift. First, let me say that I had started with a $20 safety razor, the butterfly style.&lt;br /&gt;The Edwin Jagger is much easier to use and easy to clean. The handle offers just enough grip for me and is really not too short. Overall weight is good. I dismiss the nay sayers.&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s my opinion:👍👍👍👍👍</li>
    <li> Quite different from my Gillette razor. I&#x27;m still learning to use it.  It can shave much closer than the multi-bladed mass-marketed alternatives.</li>
    <li> First safety razor ever. Takes some getting used to, but I like it. This razor seems very well made. I like the handle for extra grip, and the 3 piece design is actually pretty simple as far as changing blades. Using Astra right now, though the Derby blades that came with were just as good I think. Now I just want to get a good stand for my cheap but effective badger brush, and the razor. Proraso soap is great btw.</li>
    <li> The razor is a good size. It&#x27;s not too long or big so you can really maneuver it easily with your fingers for a detailed shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weight and balance is very good. It definitely feels like you&#x27;re using a razor and not a plastic Bic razor, which gives you more control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The finish is clean and it&#x27;s stainless steel, so it&#x27;s very easy to clean and rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The knurled grip gives you good handling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a beautiful razor for the price. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> A fine quality razor.  I have been using an Edwin Jagger long handle razor but I wanted to try the short handle version.  I prefer the short handle.</li>
    <li> I am completely in love with this razor!  A good friend turned me on to the virtues of a quality wet shave a few months ago, and handed me my first double-edged safety razor--a reconditioned 1950&#x27;s Gillette. I was so impressed after using it that I began to do more research by watching videos and reading some articles and blogs.  Soon, I began checking out customer reviews and it led me to this baby!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t even begin to tell you how pleased I am with this amazing product!  The fit and finish is gorgeous, and the shave is so close and stellar that I can hardly believe it.  My skin looks absolutely fantastic and feels baby smooth.  I will never go back to garbage store cartridges!  I am a fan for life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very, very, very happy!  Get this product, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Excellent quality--use Feather rather than Darby blades for an exceptional shave if you have been shaving traditionally.</li>
    <li> It is a short, well knurled E.J. 89.  The highest standards are upheld, as you would expect from Edwin Jagger.</li>
    <li> This really is better than the Merkur 34C. I believe it to be milder than the Merkur, probably due to the higher quality of polishing to the chrome plating. If you have small to medium hands, the shorter handle of this razor, and the Merkur 34C make for better control. I&#x27;ve looked at buying a stainless steel DE razor, but $174.00 is way to much. I instead bought 2 Edwin Jagger Kelvin razors. One for use, the other for a back up. $58.00. I use Personna Blades.</li>
    <li> Awesome shave, but handle is way too short.  Looks classy.</li>
    <li> I like the razor.  It is smaller than my previous razor but this is not an issue.  I</li>
    <li> Very good but feel very dangerous to use it ~</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this razor. I use a Merkur 34C in my travel kit, this one is far superior. The craftsmanship is second to none and I prefer the angle of the blade to any other I&#x27;ve tried. As soon as I come up with a good excuse, I&#x27;ll be buying another to upgrade my travel kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> The best shaves I have had in many years, since tha last time in clooege when I used a double-edged safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;New is NOT necessarily better!&lt;br /&gt;The quality is superb. The razor feels like an British Enfirld rifle; solid, made by serious craftsmen and ready to perform its fuction well.&lt;br /&gt;The Derby blades which come with the razor perform well. I am now using Feather Blades and they seem to last 3-4 weeks each.</li>
    <li> When it first arrived i loved this razor.  Nice short handle made it easy to use.  Then it happened.  Just like some other users, i was shaving in my copper bowl sink and dropped the razor from about 18&amp;#34;.  After it hit the sink i had 4 pieces.  Screw is sheared off right at handle so no way to remove and try to order repair parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advise not to buy this as at some point in your shaving you are going to get soap on you hand and have the razor slip out of your hand.</li>
    <li> Great razor.  This is the fourth safety razor I have tried.  The first three were all vintage Gillette razors.  I have tried a 1958 fatboy, 1940&#x27;s super speed, and a gold plated ambassador.  They were all great, and the Fatboy had been my daily shaver for the past few years.  I decided to try one of these new model razors after having a friend tell me he was very happy with his.  I have to say this razor is better than the vintage ones.  The head on this razor is the same as several others from Edwin Jagger, and the heads are made in Germany by Muhle.  I would imagine that all of the Edwin Jagger and Muhle heads work equally as well being that the handle would just be a different size or shape.  This handle is almost the exact same length and weighs almost as much as the Gillette fatboy.  I was hoping for a little more weight, but after shaving with it, it is fine.  I would say this is the shortest I would want the handle, and maybe it is a little too short.  Either way, the shave is incredible and I would be confident in recommending any razor with this head on it.  For those wonder about blades, I have tried several of those as well and find that the Personna Blades that are sold on Amazon in the blue box 100 count work the best for me, and work great in this razor.</li>
    <li> I really like the razor. The handle is a tad on the short side - other than that, it has a nice weight and works great!</li>
    <li> I have the D89 and got this for in the shower when my hands are wet/soapy...the knurling on the handle make it less slippery.  This is a wonderful product of high quality, as was my first Jagger.  I have a Merkur long handle for travel and it is noticeably less &#x27;finished&#x27; seeming vs. this..ie the chroming.  Good razor too but the Jagger seems a bit nicer.  If you like a great mix of quality, price and function this is a good choice.</li>
    <li> This is a decent quality razor.  It has an obviously heavy head and the handle seems noticeably light (almost too light) but when in use it is well balanced.  I would say this razor is on the mild side although it looks like my parker 91R and my merkur MK333c so I cant say why it seems feel milder.  All I can figure is the handle length is changing how I am shaving.  I like the thickness of the handle but I thought it would have been thicker based on pictures.  The checkering on the handle is enough to give a good grip, it is better than the basic merkur MK333c model but not as good as the Parker 91R (the checkering on the parker is incredibly deep and aggressive-I love it).  This Edwin Jagger razor has a heavy head like the Parker and a handle that LOOKS a lot like a short Parker 91R only it is much lighter and has less aggressive checkering.  If you are looking for a good quality short handled razor at a decent price, this is a good one to get (I&#x27;d choose this one over the Merkur MK333c any day...anyone want a slightly used Merkur MK333c?).  Its got heft and balance. EDIT: after using this razor a full week and comparing against a razor I just got from WSP that I got for the fat handle, I have a new appreciation for the wonderful quality of this razor.  GET IT.</li>
    <li> This is my first safety razor and I love it. I&#x27;m never going back to other razors again. The short handle works great for me and I have big hands.</li>
    <li> Nice presentation box.  Great shave so far.  I ordered the Mehaz butterfly at the same time ( http://amzn.com/B00ILOTR2E ), and find the shave to be nearly identical.  Finish and quality seem to be top notch, texture on grip works great with wet hands.  It holds the blade straight, and secure with no issues.  Classy and Timeless.</li>
    <li> I was ready to move up from my starter DE shaver: the Merkur 33C &amp;#34;Classic&amp;#34; shaver.  I&#x27;ve also purchased a Weishi/Microtouch One/Van Der Hagen shaver which was an extremely mild shaver. The latter took a lot longer to get a really smooth shave...but it was irritation free and blood free. The Merkur gave me some lessons in styptic pencil usage.  But technique improved and I&#x27;m pretty bleed-free in using the 33C...but it&#x27;s still a little irritating in the areas where I need to go over more to get to evasive whiskers...like the corners of the mouth.  So I felt ready to seek a milder razor but not one as labor intensive as the Weishi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking towards the Merkur 34C HD (easily one of the most popular shavers today) and in looking at other options, came across this Edwin Jagger.  It&#x27;s got the re-designed head that they share with Muhle and the EJ reputation for craftsmanship also was very appealing. But the cross-hatch knurled handle is what caught my eye.  One of the things that&#x27;s always kept me from looking to EJ is that most of their handles are highly polished and smooth.  I never like that design for wet shaving.  Well, once I ordered this razor and it arrived, the handle is thick, very grip-able and quite similar to the 34CHD.  Win-win!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor is beautifully crafted.  The chrome finish is flawless and the engineering of the design shows through. The short handle (3&amp;#34;) is the same as the HD and the 33C I&#x27;ve been using.  I actually prefer the shorter handle (and I&#x27;m fairly tall with larger than normal hands).  The balance was very nice in my grip. Control not an issue. My go-to blade at this time is the Israeli Personna blade and since that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m used to, that&#x27;s what I loaded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave was clean, blood-free and irritation free. Definitely more aggressive than the Weishi made razors, but less so than the Merkur 33C. A very pleasurable shave.  Regular routine includes proper face prep, Proraso green shave soap applied by badger brush and a three pass session.  BBS shave on the first try.  I will be testing some other blades in the near future (once I&#x27;ve used up my Personnas, Astras are probably my next order...they&#x27;re very smooth blades), but the shaver is fantastic for the money.  Highly recommended for relative newbies and experienced wet shavers alike.</li>
    <li> It was way to short of a handle. I wanted very much to like this razor due to the better grip but it was tiny!! I sent it back. Still using my trusty old Edwin Jagger.</li>
    <li> A fine small razor perfect for travel. Nice balance with a good grip (thanks to handle knurling) that allows finger tip control. After several shaves I found that this razor really likes a mild blade , such as Bic or Astra, that really lets this small razor shine! I will use it for travel while using my longer handles for every day.  I was going to return it due to the short handle but the full length knurling really makes up for short handle length for me.  Nice little razor it is............</li>
    <li> This is my second Edwin Jagger razor and it has become my favorite.  I find the shorter handle is easier for me to use, especially with the knurled finish on the handle which allows for a much more positive grip even when wet with shaving soap.</li>
    <li> Newish to wet shaving. This is my second D/E razor. The first was a Weishi $13 special and it kinda worked. But this here E J Kelvin is infinitely better in every way possible. Still need to spend a little time lining up the blade to the head before clamping the blade. The weight is nice, not too light and handle length doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. I&#x27;m only holding the razor with four fingers anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this razor to anyone and everyone. I got the Weishi as a starter but I think the Jagger makes for a better starters experience. And would be great for seasoned wet shavers too.</li>
    <li> This is basically a EJ DE89 head on a merkur 34c handle minus the knob at the end. The over all length is exactly the same and the handle is the same diameter.  The Kelvin is more head heavy for sure. The finish on the Kelvin is better but that won&#x27;t effect the shave. I would call the EJ more of a polished look and the HD a more industrial look. The grip on the handle is the same but the knob on the HD adds a little extra control I think. I feel like the shave is slightly more comfortable with the Kelvin but the HD is slightly more efficient. Either way you will walk away with the exact same shave in the end. The Kelvin is better for sensitive skin and the HD is better for a more coarse beard. The 2 piece design of the hd makes for slightly easier blade changes and you are far less likely to strip the threads or break off the bolt. However, with a little care that&#x27;s not an issue and the 3 piece design of the kelvin leaves your options open for handle changes down the road. For the money I say this is the best razor on the market by far. Also, don&#x27;t assume that more money equals a better shave cause that&#x27;s just not the case it comes down to good technique and finding the right blade to match your razor and skin type. This razor, a pack of Astra SP blades, a Semogue 620 Brush, and a tub of Taylor of Old Bond Street cream is what I would recommend to anyone just starting out. Google Catie&#x27;s Bubbles for arguably the best shave soap out there.</li>
    <li> I own several double edge razors &amp; this is my favorite.  It is similar to the Merkur HD, but seems to be of better quality.  I get a smooth shave &amp; hardly ever nick myself like I sometimes do with the Merkur.  The handle is short but gives a good grip due to the knurled pattern.  I also own a EJ 89 lined version but was never satisfied with the grip.  I would strongly recommend this razor to anyone.  You will also save lots of money if you have been using cartridge razors.  The blades are about only about 10 cents each.</li>
    <li> Like every Edwin Jagger razor with their current closed comb head, the shave is outstanding. It strikes that elusive balance of aggressive to your wiskers and mild to your skin. I&#x27;m not sure how they can do it while others fail, but I always get a close shave with it. Other razors seem to be hit or miss with me, especially some of the moderately priced Merkurs. This one gives me a good shave with any blade. I have never nicked myself while shaving with an Edwin Jagger. I have scraped myself a couple of times by thinking I could go over that area just once more. That would generally be ok if my skin was wet and there was shaving cream on it. Well there wasn&#x27;t. I won&#x27;t make that mistake again. Specifically to this model razor , the handle on the Kelvin is unique to Amazon. It is relatively short and handles really well. While some may think it is too short and too light, it is not. It is extremely well balanced. My belief is that those that do not like it want it to be like their current razor, what ever that razor is. This is it&#x27;s own model. It has great balance, a decent grip, and with the perfect head to carry and present the blade, gives an extraordinary shave at a very ordinary price. I can&#x27;t imagine anyone not liking it, though this is the anonymous internet, so they&#x27;ll always be a few. As far as appearance goes, the chrome is absolutely flawless. This is like jewelry. The knurled handle gets points for style, though it isn&#x27;t the sharp edged knurling expected of a great tool. The grip is improved over a smooth or lined handle, but it is a combination of form and function. It isn&#x27;t bad. I just wanted to point it out to give a complete and honest review. With this combination of style, chrome, maneuverability, and an amazing shave, it is a can&#x27;t miss purchase. Buy it.</li>
    <li> Better than expected! Great value!</li>
    <li> Bought this as a travel razor, but it&#x27;s contending for daily use.  I was surprised how well this shaved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My current daily razor is a Merkur 43C which I love, but as a two piece I didn&#x27;t want to risk damage to the long screw by packing it.  So I opted for the three-piece Kelvin at roughly half the price for its flatter packing profile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a shaving perspective it is first rate as the shave it provides is of high quality.  I was able to do a three-pass without irritation.  Having large hands, I held the handle with three fingers like a chop stick or pen.  Using this approach allowed for a functional and reasonably pleasant shave.  However, I removed a star because I find the handle to be the weak link in the design.  It is shorter, lighter, and the knurling provides less grip than I had hoped.  This traits would push it out of day to day use for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Be sure to assemble it correctly. My first use had the middle piece inverted.  There was zero blade gap and therefore zero shaving.  I was ready to return it, finding it useless.  Once I realized my error (bottom plate has an indentation for the handle) and assembled it correctly, I was able to get one of the best shaves I ever had.  I think one of the earlier reviewers may have made this error, because they complained the razor&#x27;s mildness was off the charts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m now on the hunt or a stainless steel handle that addresses the Kelvin&#x27;s weight, length and grip limitations, once that is in hand I foresee a frankenrazor that will be seeing daily duty and not occasional travel use.  Great tool with a minor mod.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update... I ended up paired a 4&amp;#34; heavy steel handle from a Mac razor and could not be happier.  While I still prefer the Merkur&#x27;s shave the Kelvin will see occasional daily duty going forward.</li>
    <li> The best!! Very smoth</li>
    <li> For a long time i tried my dad&#x27;s portable razor which had been the best portable razor i had seen till date. The sharpness that it had required me to use it very gently. Later i switched to Mach3 and have been using it for years until i finally decided to switch back to old school DE razor style. This razor is excellent in looks and build, the slight angle that it gives to the blade allows you to push the head against your skin deeper and gets you a closer shave. I get a very close shave and rarely any cuts with this.</li>
    <li> I love this DE. The &amp;#34;Kelvin&amp;#34; handle really adds grip and the stubby handle isn&#x27;t as inconvenient as I thought it might be. Once you get used to keeping your pinky under the end it&#x27;s nice. The three pieces secure together very tightly and doesn&#x27;t come loose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By far the best thing about this razor is the finish. It&#x27;s gorgeous.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t provide a close shave.  I had to shave the same are multiple times in every possible direction to get a close shave.  This is not what you want to do to your face.  The Jagger compares rather poorly to the Merkur 37c which takes the hair down smooth in one swipe.  The plus side to the Jagger is that it&#x27;s almost impossible to cut yourself.</li>
    <li> Excellent Razor - both quality and workmanship.  Handle is short but allows greater maneuverability.</li>
    <li> A tiny bit shorter than the DE89x series. Nice and heavy, short, exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Nice razor. Very nice finish. I bought this to compare to my Merkur 34c HD. While the finish is a tad nicer than the 34c, I believe I still prefer my 34c. The head is beautiful but the handle seems cheap to me. Light weight in feel and the Edwin Jagger engraving around the handle is not evenly embossed. Also, the threads for the head and handle are not machined to be exact...just close. Be careful not to cross thread when starting the handle. While I admit,I haven&#x27;t shaved with the EJ yet, if I was to go on feel of the razor in hand, I prefer my 34c at this point.</li>
    <li> Nice razor but too mild for my tastes.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this razor because I wanted a bit of a change from the Merkur 23C I bought at The Art of Shaving a few years ago. Then, I went of the salesperson&#x27;s recommendation and was looking into getting into wet shaving (mostly to get away from the expense of cartridges). When I bought this razor, I had a lot more information from my lurking in wet shaving forums and reviews from popular wet shaving youtubers. I&#x27;d known for a while that the Edwin Jagger DE89 was a popular razor out there. I kept putting off a decision to buy that razor, remembering that the purpose of my wet shaving was to keep the expense down in that activity. Recently, I noticed the Edwin Jagger Kelvin pop-up in my Amazon recommended (I browse a lot of DE razor gear on here). The handle of my 23C is pretty long and can get unwieldy in difficult areas like the back of my head (oh, I should mention I shave my head) and around my ears. I heard a few head shavers in the wet shaving community use short handles to keep a good control going when reaching those areas.&lt;br /&gt;So, I decided to plunge in and get the Kelvin. It seemed like a DE89 with a short, knurled handle. I thought that would be a perfect change from my old trusty 23C. However, it ended up being too mild a shave for me. It feels pretty good and glides well across the skin but never had the feeling of being too effective in cutting the hairs. I tried this for a few weeks and noticed I had to do quite a few touch-up passes after my normal 3 pass shave to get my beard/head down to where I felt comfortable with the result. I never got BBS when using this razor. I&#x27;ve tried concentrating on the angle and I always shave with a new blade, as my head hair is much coarser than my beard and tends to dull blades after one shave. I do a decent amount of prep beforehand including a pre-shower lather on my face and scalp to soften hair before I soak it in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;As my shaves were taking longer with this razor, I tried taking the bulk of the hair down the night before and doing a cleanup in the morning. That just started irritating my skin, as the time between shaves didn&#x27;t allow my skin to fully heal from the shave the night before. Eventually, I just caved in and bought a slant to increase the efficiency of the shave in not requiring as many passes to remove the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m not taking the rating down that far because it did do a decent job on my face and was a mild shave (as was expected when I bought the product). I just needed the practical lesson in what a &#x27;mild&#x27; shave was and that it wouldn&#x27;t work for my situation. The razor wasn&#x27;t bad, overall, it just wasn&#x27;t up to the task of what I was putting it to use for. I&#x27;m sure there are a few reviews out there that contradict my experiences but I did try to make this product work for me and it didn&#x27;t happen. Edwin Jagger makes fine products and I&#x27;ll not leave the razor to idle on the stand. I&#x27;ll keep experimenting with it to see if my own errors were part of the problem but more than likely I&#x27;ll pass it on to a friend or family member to start their own wet shaving journey. We are all different and what doesn&#x27;t work for me might be the very thing to jump-start a young (or older) man to kick the cartridge money-drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, the shipping was very quick and the packaging was very good.razor, I tried taking the bulk of the hair down the night before and doing a cleanup in the morning.

    <li> Love this razor. Now my favorite, and I rarely use my others. Beefy, solid and good looking.</li>
    <li> This razor is all that it is advertised. It is an excellent razor.</li>
    <li> Nice weight and finish, but the corners are a bit sharp and make for a less comfortable shave than with the 60 year old Gillette I was replacing.</li>
    <li> Wow, what a great safety razor.  A shorter handle than the standard DE89, with a barleycorn checkering pattern for better grip.  Never had it slip.  Makes almost any blade good, though I like Astra SP and Personnas in this one.  I&#x27;m going to give Feather another try as well.  The shorter handle makes it more agile but less flexible.  Probably a great razor for head shavers and folks who need to trim around the edges of their beards.</li>
    <li> Love the razor, price and service were just right.</li>
    <li> Really excellent razor!</li>
    <li> First safety razor in decades, feels great.</li>
    <li> This product works well as it should. Edwin Jagger is know for their chrome finish and it is amazing. The knurling is great but the handle seems shallow. If you are a vintage Gillette user, you will notice the difference in quality as most if not all Gillette safety razors are brass and have some weight to it. Otherwise, this razor is amazing and would recommend it to new and experienced users.</li>
    <li> Awesome razor!  Totally worth the money!  I am relatively new to wet-shaving.  My first razor was a Micro Touch One.  It does a decent job, but I read so may positive reviews about the Edwin Jagger and Merkur razors, that I decided I wanted to get one or the other.  Well, I went with the Edwin Jagger Kelvin.  It has the same head as the DE 89, only the handle is knurled as opposed to lined.  I love this razor.  My face is a smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt!!</li>
    <li> This razor is perfect in every single way. Its nice and heavy, excellent build quality and beautiful finish. Good grip and the smaller size gives you good control, since with DE shaving you use the weight of the head and not force. I will probably use it for the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> (Note: My review does not indicate a Verified Purchase because my wife purchased this razor with her Amazon Prime account as a Fathers Day gift for me.)    I already own the EJ DE89lbl and am very happy with it.  I got this razor specifically because of the handle.  It is shorter than the lbl (just under 3\\&quot;) and has an interesting looking knurling.  A number of people with larger hands complain about short handle razors.  My hands are plenty large, but I happen to like the look and feel of shorter handle razors.  I just find them to be more maneuverable and classic looking.  I own about 20 different models of safety razors and the Edwin Jagger DE89 head is one of my favorites.  It shaves extremely well and comfortably.  I enjoy the novelty of safety razors as much as shaving with them.  Because of this it is difficult to say which is my favorite, but this is one razor I will never part with.  If you are new to safety razors, I would encourage you to check out the plethora of instructional videos on YouTube.  It could make the difference between a great experience and a disappointing one.    Bottom line: This is a quality safety razor and one of the classiest I have seen, modern day or vintage.  The chrome finish is fantastic and almost looks like a Rhodium plated razor.  It looks like it could be a highly coveted vintage razor from days gone by. This razor provides an incredibly comfortable and close shave.  Everyone has different opinions about razor blades, but the one I&#x27;ve settled on and get great results with is the Personna Lab Blue (also available through Amazon at a fair price).  I find the heavier weight of the razor to be a plus.  The shorter handle puts most of the weight at the head, which is exactly what I find desirable when needing to let the weight of the razor do the work without applying pressure.  The knurling on the handle is really nice.  It took a while for this razor to become available through Amazon and there is currently a 2 to 5 week ship time.  It&#x27;s a little unfortunate, but was well worth the wait.  I plan on ordering a second one just in case this razor becomes unavailable in the future.    A caveat: reviews can become confusing when you see a range from 1 to 5 stars.  It is my opinion that if this razor receives less than 4 stars, it is likely because the reviewer either doesn&#x27;t know the proper technique of wet shaving, or has some type of affiliation with a competitor&#x27;s product.</li>
    <li> My first ever double edge was an Edwin Jagger DE89Lbl but the stud on the top piece that screws into the handle broke (I had it for 3 years) so I thought I&#x27;d try this one. The Edwin Jagger DE89Lbl has a lined handle while this Kelvin model has a shorter knurled handle. I got used to it right away but I prefer the longer handle on the Edwin Jagger DE89Lbl so I just switch them every once in a while. They both use the same shave head so the performance is exactly the same. The finish of the chrome is what I would&#x27;ve expect from Edwin Jagger which is flawless. Overall a good buy.</li>
    <li> This razor gave me the best shave ever. It is my favorite safety razor and I own 73 safety razors. The quality is second to none. My second place razor is an open comb Muhle, third is a Merkur 34C, fourth is a $20 TTO Mehaz, and fifth is the $16 Feather TTO.</li>
    <li> The photo gave the impression that the handle was longer, but I think the product is well made, have not try to shave with it yet. I do however, have a problem with delivery of this item, it took 7 days to be delivered and I am a prime member!!</li>
    <li> Excellent razor.. I have been using a vintage 1950&#x27;s Gillette for the past couple years - this razor is heavier in feel, and more chrome than nickle in appearance. The handle is short which is nice and it holds the heat from the water longer than the old Gillette. Very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> This razor arrived on a day when I was wearing three days of stubble, so I broke it out, took a deep breath, and started shaving. In a word, AMAZING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had a straight razor shave from a third-generation barber in Little Italy in New York, and this was the closest thing to that I&#x27;ve ever had. The next morning it seemed redundant to shave again, but I did just for the experience. Yes, I was a bit slower due to overabundant caution, but a couple weeks later I&#x27;m breezing through confidently. I also shave my head and was concerned about doing it with a double-edge razor, since I have a large scar on my head where I can&#x27;t see it to be careful. No problem! The short handle means you don&#x27;t need that silly flex head because the handle isn&#x27;t hitting your collar bone or the heel of your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone says use a light hand and no pressure... totally true! Imagine you&#x27;re shaving a balloon, and it&#x27;s easy. Vincenzo, the barber in New York used remarkably short strokes, so I emulate that, and get what other people can clearly see is a closer shave without irritation. Jump in! I&#x27;m going to save $200 every year or more on not buying the plastic throw-away (already garbage the day they&#x27;re made) cartridges. Save the planet and your wallet, and shave like a man. Go ahead. You deserve this razor!</li>
    <li> My first safety razor.  This little number provides a very close shave and goes through anything.  In fact, just the other night, I used it to completely shave off my beard, instead of just trimming around it.  Normally, I would have to take out my beard trimmer, splattered beard hairs all over the place, and then used my old five bladed cartridge shaver taking up half an hour or more.  Not this time, this razor trimmed off my half-inch long beard in no time without irritation.</li>
    <li> I am not a shaving connoisseur in any way, I don&#x27;t have 14 razors, unicorn haired brushes, etc....I am just an average guy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday I received my Edwin Jagger DE safety razor from Amazon. I will say I was a bit disappointed on how small the actual handle is. I know it says 3 inches on the web page but wow the handle is small. Regardless, instead if sending it back I thought I would try it out. I must say I was kind of nervous about using it since I have only ever used the disposable 3/4 blade kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving:&lt;br /&gt;The razor has a nice weight to it but once again I find the handle to be too small for my liking. I open the razor and insert a razor blade to begin shaving. As other reviewers have mentioned the blade does stick out the sides of the razor. I am not sure why it is designed this way but I see it as a flaw and potential issue when I get around to shaving my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I watched a couple youtube videos on how to shave with a safety razor so I was prepared. I shaved like I normally would but didn&#x27;t apply the same amount of pressure I would with a disposable. I did not shave 3 or 4 times in different directions like some of the youtube videos suggest. Just quick short strokes (hehehe) like i normally do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave was very close and very smooth. On par or possible better than what I normally get with a disposable. I shave my head 3 times a week so I will give that a shot next. Since there isnt any flex like a disposable I am a bit concerned but we will see. I will try and update this review after shaving my head.</li>
    <li> Beautiful! This is my second Edwin Jagger razor. I bought it for travel as the other one is for my use at home. The machining and chroming are absolutely perfect. The design is perfect as well. Gives a close shave without ripping my face apart.</li>
    <li> Oh. My. Goodness. This is the razor I have been waiting for. I have been trying to avoid Merkur razors because they are being recommended like iPhones. I have hoping to find something different that&#x27;s not what &amp;#34;everyone else&amp;#34; had or wanted. So I started my journey with no-name brand razors until I finally hit a wall with cost and qualities. My most recent purchase was a Feather Popular and I was looking for something with more bite than that mild razor. I turned my attention to Edwin Jagger and often times though to buying the razor but I just couldn&#x27;t get over the limited amount of handle types they had to offer. They were not attractive to me. Well, here comes Amazon to save to day with an exclusive EJ razor. It was more than worth the wait to get something unique and stylish. I love the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor sits good in the hand and has a good heft to it. It takes some getting used to since I started DE shaving with light and mild razors.&lt;br /&gt;I can get consistent close shave in two passes and it has a little more bite than than a Feather Popular. I&#x27;m currently using the supplied Derby Razors but I have many more in my collection that are much sharper I will use once I establish technique with this excellent razor.</li>
    <li> Great weight.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> Originally purchased the [[ASIN:B00PKGXZ24 WEISHI 9306FL Long Handle Version HEAVY WEIGHT Butterfly Open Double Edge Safety Razor with 5 YingJiLi Razor Blades]] during the Amazon Prime Day,  had been looking at getting into shaving with a DE Safety razor and made the jump.  The Weishi was ok and got me hooked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spent some time trying to decide between the Edwin Jagger DE89 and the Merkur 34C for an upgrade as they are both very highly regarded.  Then the Kelvin popped up on one of my searches and it appeared to be the best of both worlds, short heavy knurled handle and the EJ/Muhle head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is exponentially better than the Weishi in build quality and smoothness of shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking to get into wet shaving you really can&#x27;t go wrong with this razor.</li>
    <li> fit and finish are superb, weight is balanced, shave is sublime. thanks amazon for the textured handle!</li>
    <li> I grew up with Double Edge Razors.  I used the old Gillette&#x27;s through high school and my tour in the military, and then for the first part of my working life, about 20 years I guess.  Keeping up with the new technology I went back and forth with Cartridge Razors and Electric Shavers for the next 30 years.  Now that I&#x27;m retired I have more time to pursue some of the things I&#x27;ve been missing.  One of those things is enjoying a good soothing shave the way it was in days past.  A few months ago I happened to see an inexpensive DE razor and picked up.  I was hooked on Double Edge Shaving at once, even though that particular razor left a lot to be desired.  Back in the day the DE or Injector razors were the only choices. NO, Straight Razors were before my time, and only the barbers used them.  Even though today we have many more selections for our shaving equipment, I can truly say that Double Edge shaving is my method of choice.  Now to the point, this Edwin Jagger Kelvin, which is just one version of the DE89 series, is very fine piece of equipment.  Heavy, well built, nice balance, not too aggressive, comfortable grip and handle length, good finish, and most of all great saving results.  I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong with this one, I didn&#x27;t.  This is a very nice razor and one that you should consider in buying a new razor.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent razor.  I can achieve very smooth shaves with negligible stubble against the grain and zero irritation.  Of the nine double edge razors, this is the one I reach for.  Blade fit is excellent.  These blades work well for me in the Kelvin: PolSilver SI, Gillette Silver Blue, Astra SP, Personna Lab, and Personna Med Prep.  Try it, stay with it for 6 months, hope you like it.</li>
    <li> A better version of the Merkur 34 HD!  Love it!</li>
    <li> Got it with a stand. First time DE shaver. A few minor cuts the first time, but all good now.</li>
    <li> Great razor.  Nice finish.  Good weight.  Great shave</li>
    <li> Like it better than even my DE86 which has the same head, different handle</li>
    <li> This is a very attractive razor and elegant in its design. Very classy. It gives close, comfortable shaves, like other EJ 89 heads. It&#x27;s a light-intermediate head that will give great daily shaves. I prefer a moderate-to-aggressive sharp blade in it (Polsilver,etc.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The attraction, of course, is the shorter handle, which measures exactly 75mm. That makes it 5mm shorter than a Bulldog handle (80mm). The burling is functional and attractive, but not especially sharp, like the deep diamond cuts on solid chrome-plated brass handles; the look is more elegant, refined, but function lovers might like deeper cuts. So in essence, it&#x27;s a better gripping version of the 89lbl handle, only shorter. EJ has needed a better gripping, shorter handle, and I suppose this is one effort in that direction. It works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weight balance slightly favors the head on this razor, keeping it in contact with the skin without having to add much additional pressure. I like razors to favor the head slightly or be neutral, such is a quality of shorter, more traditional handles. It&#x27;s an Archimedes thing in reverse. Too much pressure is a bad thing in DE shaving. Overall, its an elegant attractive razor I recommend if you&#x27;re looking for that 89 shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a very pretty AND functional razor. You&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> Not sure if I am a good resource on comparison of DE Razors. This is because I am a HUGE Fan of Edwin Jagger Razors. My wife and family ALL own Edwin Jagger Razors.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this razor so I could have an extra one for travel and weekend getaways. I really like the knurling on the handle a great surprise. The quality &amp;#34;hands down&amp;#34; is impeccable! Take note that this handle is shorter than their standard DE Razor, but this is the reason I bought it. I received this yesterday and used it this morning. I must say the razor did not disappoint. Kinda enjoyed the shorter handle. Great product.</li>
    <li> First time ever using this type of razor, and I was astonished. Highly recommended for all men, unless you are just learning to shave as it could be dangerous.</li>
    <li> Well made razor, but the head unscrews from the handle to change blades.  It&#x27;s a design choice, that in my opinion makes it a safety hazard.  If you use too much force to unscrew the head and your fingers slip, they could be sliced by the razor blade.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had issues with shaving, especially with ingrown hairs, and it got bad enough I moved to just using an electric beard trimmer instead of any razor. However, doing this I was trimming all the time and honestly I missed the feel of a freshly-shaved face. A friend recommended using a DE razor, and there has been a movement away from expensive cartridge razors back to a more simple solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After doing some research I found that the Edwin Jagger razors had consistently good reviews and tended to be a mild shave. I chose this one because a) it is a &amp;#34;shorty&amp;#34; and b) it has a textured handle. Although I have large hands, I tend to not know my own strength, so a razor that required me to use a delicate touch was something I wanted. Once the shaver arrived, I was immediately impressed by the quality and feel of it. It certainly doesn&#x27;t look or feel cheap, and even though it&#x27;s a bit expensive for one&#x27;s &amp;#34;first&amp;#34; shaver, I feel like it is an excellent produce for the price. You get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t regret the choice! I used it with one of the included Derby razors and was impressed how simple using a DE was. Making sure to use the proper technique (e.g. no pressure), the shave was effortless and pain-free. Although this is dependent upon the blade, my skin didn&#x27;t feel burned or raw at all after the shave. I guess I was just impressed how light of a touch got the job done, almost like just running a finger over your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my first DE razor and first experience in DE razor shaving, and I have zero regrets. This razor has a mild shave, and it is almost idiot-proof for those trying out DE shaving. I HIGHLY recommend this razor for the novice shaver.</li>
    <li> Perfect solution to stop supporting corporate disposable plastic razors.  Super-close shave.</li>
    <li> So happy to be away from disposables and plastic.  Shave as close with a single blade as with 3 or 5 or what ever the new gimmick.  Get good blades and you will be very satisfied.  Love the short handle and quality feel of the razor.</li>
    <li> This 3 piece razor has a sturdy construction and a fine chrome finish.  It appears to be very similar to the Merkur 34C.  I have shaved about 15 times with 3 different blades from a sampler pack without cutting myself.  This indicates that if you use reasonable caution this razor should be good even for beginners.</li>
    <li> Fantastic razor. Beautiful!!  I like the short handle while it maintains the desired heft of a quality safety razor.  My preference of blades for this product are Astra blades.  I really like the handle...does not slip or slide!  Will be using this for a very long time!</li>
    <li> WOW!!!! What a great razor. I wish I had bought this sooner. I have Wilkinson sword blades and every time I used them in my old razor I felt like I was ripping my face apart and stopped using them... When I received this kelvin, I tried the Wilkinson blade the first time out. What a smooth, close clean shave. No ripping, no fear of nicks, just a great shave. The price is well worth it, if you want a good razor to start with or you just want a good DE razor.  My dad always said its always about quality first and price second. You wont be sorry if you purchase this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a merkur futur for about a year and the Edwin Jagger Kelvin gives me a closer shave and cleans out better when rinsing the razor off.  Has the same head as the de89 but a different/shorter handle.  Now my favorite razor and cost $40 less than the merkur futur.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality and shave experience!</li>
    <li> Received yesterday, and (of course!) used this morning.  Construction, fit and finish appear great. The head screws on perpendicular to the handle, the two pieces of the head fit are uniformly mated all around, and the chrome job is so bright I had to check to make sure it wasn&#x27;t internally lit.  Ok, that last part is an exaggeration, but not much. This thing is purty! This razor was purchased to replace a Micro Touch One (Yes, the one in the TV commercials- really not a bad razor. I just wanted something a bit better).  Functionally, it feels slightly more aggressive, and the overall quality is much better.  I used the same brand of blades (the Dorcos sold along side the MTO at Wally World) so as not to change 2 things at once.  The Kelvin gave me a better shave right off the bat. I&#x27;m looking forward to trying the Darby blades that came with it as well as the better blades in the Sample Pack I also bought. So, overall, I&#x27;m very impressed with this razor.  I tend to grip a razor high up by the head so the length of the handle isn&#x27;t an issue. The checkering has no burrs or anything unpleasant to the touch and provides a good grip even with soapy hands.  I hope to get years of service from it.  I might have to buy a second EJ because I have two sons and I&#x27;d hate for them to tear the family apart fighting over who gets this one after I&#x27;m gone. ;-) Update after a week- I like this razor. A lot. With the high grip I use, it balances very well.  It&#x27;s not a super aggressive design, but I have had some very close shaves this week using Astra SPs for 3 shaves and a Personna Med Prep for the list 4 (the 4th being the best shave I can ever remember).    My brother in law will be getting an Edwin Jagger for his upcoming birthday (yes, I like him).</li>
    <li> Great razor for the price</li>
    <li> Rather than repeat what the other 5-star reviews have stated, let me merely add that this razor is similar to the [[ASIN:B00JGR6GEW Knurled Handle DE Safety Razor - De89KN14bl razor by Edwin Jagger]] and has a 3/8\\&quot; shorter handle. I own the EJ 89 Knurled, and the handle measurement is 3 and 3/8\\&quot; long, measuring with the handle removed from the head. I have read other Kelvin reviewers state the Kelvin handle is approx. 3\\&quot;. If you would like an EJ 89  with a 3/8\\&quot; longer knurled handle, I would suggest the [[ASIN:B00JGR6GEW Knurled Handle DE Safety Razor - De89KN14bl razor by Edwin Jagger]], also available here on Amazon. (Measurements are approximate.) I do not believe the photos of the Knurled do it justice - the knurling is very fine and deep and appears much like the Kelvin. The knobs appear to be differently knurled and I believe there is a price difference.</li>
    <li> Mine got knocked off the ~3 foot high fink and hit the tile floor and the screw from the bottom of the head that threads into the handle snapped right off so now I can&#x27;t possibly just replace 1 piece because there&#x27;s no way to get the bottom of the screw out of the handle.  Very dissappointed.</li>
    <li> This weekend while shaving in the shower, the razor slip out of my hand and fell in the floor. The screw that holds the head and blade broke apart. After a close look, the metal looks like a sponge and not totally solid as I expected when I bought it. This speaks of the good looks but poor quality of the material and manufacturing process. Do they have spare parts? I doubt it.</li>
    <li> It had probably been 40 years since I had used a double edged blade razor!!!  I bought this because nostalgia got the best of me.  The razor is well made, but after a few shaves I remembered why they invented the newer safety razors!!!  I had forgotten why I had needed a styptic pencil years ago.  A nice razor, but no thanks,,,,,,I&#x27;ll stick with the modern ones.</li>
    <li> The chrome job on this razor is beautiful. The fit and finish is absolutely top notch. As good or better than anything from Merkur. Doesn&#x27;t really shave any better than 3 blade plastic disposables, but it is a whole lot more stylish. Takes a few weeks to learn the proper angle and shaving style for a DE. But once you switch, DE shaving will be a lot cheaper in the long run. DE blade is lasting about as long as the disposables for me (2-3 weeks).</li>
    <li> Quality DE 3 piece razor. This is one of my favorite razors. Has a nice heft to it and gives a great shave. I wished the handle was about 1/2 inch longer tho. Still it&#x27;s a very nice razor and very nice looking. I recommend it to anyone wanting to try wet shaving.</li>
    <li> Well made razor with the same quality build as other Edwin Jagger razors. It has the very nice Muhle head. Very mild razor as are all the EJ razors. Too mild for me but likely perfect for many. A great first DE.  I bought several and gave them as gifts to friends new to traditional sharing.</li>
    <li> This is my first safety razor, and it did exactly what it was supposed to do- it shaved the hair off my face. As others have noted, the handle is pretty short, but it really wasn&#x27;t a problem. Best part: with the cost of replacement blades, this thing is going to pay for itself in no time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A quick note to others who are buying their first safety razor, and are considering this one: Do it. Also, pay no attention to some of these other &amp;#34;seasoned veterans&amp;#34; of safety razors who talk about them the way a samurai talks about his sword. A lot of them take this waaaaay too seriously, and make it sound as if you need a black belt in ninjitsu to use one of these things &amp;#34;properly.&amp;#34; I pulled mine out of the box, having never used a safety razor before, and put in one of the blades that came with it. Presto. I shaved in the exact same amount of time I would have with a cartridge razor. Baby smooth, no nicks, no problem. It&#x27;s easy.</li>
    <li> I am glad I chose this as my first razor with its short and fat handle which I was looking for my first razor to purchase. It has a great balance as well as looking beautiful doing the cut. I strongly recommend this razor for the wet shaving beginners.</li>
    <li> Excellent razor.  Short handle allows good maneuverability under my jaw. The fit and finish are superb.</li>
    <li> Wow. This is my 2nd DE razor, my starter being the Weishi long handled butterfly. I was wondering if DE razors weren&#x27;t for me, but I decided to give this one a try because of the name and the great reviews, and I&#x27;m glad I did. I paid 30 dollars for this razor and even at twice the price I would have been incredibly happy. The Weishi was a good starter razor, but used to tear up the bottom half of my neck, which has always been a problem area for me. Even with 4 passes and going against the grain with the Kelvin, I had one nick and barely any razor burn, and that was my first time using it. I love this razor and will likely never use anything else again. I may even buy another just in case.</li>
    <li> This is my first safety razor, and I chose this one after reading far too many reviews of far too many options. I like that it has a knurled texture so that it grips well. I also like the heavy, solid feel. I was on the fence about the length (it is short), but it does feel good in the hand, and I don&#x27;t think I would want anything longer now that I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks. You can debate the merits of this razor compared to other razors for eons, but in the end, I&#x27;m satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> High quality, and gives you a $250 shave for 1/8 what those overpriced self- cleaning  electric wastes of money costs. :)</li>
    <li> Beautifully crafted and chromed razor.  High quality.  Performs well, but one should be aware it has a short handle and is fairly heavy.  Will try other blades, but so far have only used the derbys it came with.  DE shaving is an art and requires time to do it well.  After one shave you notice the difference between these and disposables.  Good creams and lotions enhance the experience.  ( note, I do put Vaseline in the threads of handle and on top post just to insure no water tarnish or rust, although this razor is of such high quality,I don&#x27;t think you would have that problem anyhow ).  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I love this razor! I found this razor on accident and read the other reviews which helped in my decision to buy. Edwin Jagger makes a fantastic razor and the shave is smooth and comfortable. For a great priced razor the quality and chroming I feel are second to none! The handle is very short like a Merkur 34C but comfortable to hold and easy to use and the head has a really nice weight to it.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely purchase this or other Edwin Jagger razors again and again. If you like wet shaving you should try this razor!</li>
    <li> A. Good shaver but the handle is a we bit short for my preference.</li>
    <li> Great razor, like the short handle, knurling gives good grip. For me the best EJ razor out there. Of course that&#x60;s just my opinion!</li>
    <li> Very nice fit/finish.  would purchase again.</li>
    <li> So forgiving! I&#x27;m still fairly new to DE shaving, started with a welshi then got a parker 82. The 82 is kind of difficult. While the welshi is easy to shave with it does take a few passes to get it down to smooth. The parker is a bit harsh and requires a against the grain pass to get smooth. The de 89 is so far superior to them both! Two passes with minimal against the grain strokes yeilds you a very smooth shave.  It gave me the confidence of a mach 3 but with she smooth glide of a de. The search is over this is my razor.&lt;br /&gt;The short handle made me look again but in use is much better than the longer handles as I feel much more in control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: the weight and balance of this razor finally helped me master the mantra. NO PRESSURE!&lt;br /&gt;Plus I cant stress this more, keep the angle as low as this razor will let you.  Its aggressive enough to allow you to drag the razor at some higher angles for tough spots but for other shaving keep that top cap as a guide so the razor is just grazing the skin.  That was the last thing i needed to do to make de shaving my go to of choice for comfort and closeness</li>
    <li> Poor quality control evident from the fact that on delivery a part of the razor handle had a piece of chrome missing. I expected much more from Edwin Jagger and from Amazon and was bitterly disappointed. It certainly is buyer beware, and hard to believe this from a company like Edwin Jagger.</li>
    <li> Solidly built little razor that&#x27;s great for both beginner and seasoned vet. Very comparable to the Merkur 34C -- pick your poison if you&#x27;re comparing these two for your first razor. This EJ has a slight edge in the styling, but both are amazing quality.</li>
    <li> My husband loves his Christmas present!</li>
    <li> Nice short handle 3 Piece razor. Very light weight which isn&#x27;t a plus for me because I prefer a razor with more heft to it. I find the claims of the superior fit and finish of Jagger and Muhle over Merkur to be greatly exaggerated. I do like the short handle but by far the absolute best of the various safety razors I own the Merkur Futur wins hands down. The Futur features make it the one to own if you just need one razor. Easy spring loaded pop of head [2 piece razor] for easiest blade changes just press the dimpled side of the head and it pops right off, an over sized head for a really comfortable shave, also its head is adjustable  [blade gap] for your preference or for those like me that don&#x27;t shave every day, whiskers rense out the easiest of all the safety razors I have tried. And lastly nice weight / heft to it. The Kelvin is a good razor especially for daily shavers but it  can&#x27;t beat the Futur and its superior design features.</li>
    <li> It is OK, but the handle is too short and light compared to the regular version of the EJ89.</li>
    <li> Great razor for a 1st timer. Easy to use and close shave.</li>
    <li> I have an above the tie razor - ikon oss - and this&lt;br /&gt;Edwin Jagger Kelvin Double Edged Safety Razor  is one of my favorite. I had a Edwin Jagger DE89 and let a friend try it. He liked it so much i let him keep it. Only thing about the kelvin i don&#x27;t like is the handle is shorter than the ED de89. since i had a nice handle from another razor that was longer, i use it on my new kelvin. And i just bought some&lt;br /&gt;Personna Double Edge Razor Blades, 100 Count .. and they are probably my favorite blades. Very smooth to shave with.</li>
    <li> Has a good weight feel to it. Nice and polish. Handle is a little short but gives a good grip.</li>
    <li> An excellent choice for an everyday, dependable shave. The extra short Edwin Jagger handle is wonderful - wish it weighed a few grams more. Still, the razor is a champ and really suited to a wide variety of skin/beard types. I would guess that 90% of men would find they can get a superb shave with this razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to DE shaving and this is my second DE razor. For me, with a Derby blade, this razor gave me my best shave ever on the first use. Truly exceptional product.</li>
    <li> The handle on this razor is just under 3&amp;#34; long. The Knurling on the handle is not very large, but enough to make a difference when shaving.  The head is a typical Edwin jagger head. If you are not familiar with Edwin Jagger razors. They are great and not over priced. I own six razors. Three Merkurs ,witch two of them are Progess Razors. Twice as much money as this Edwin Jagger . And they don&#x27;t give me a shave as good as either of my, two Edwin Jaggers. I also have a Weber Stainless steel razor, That shaves real well, I paid $75 for it. And the Edwin Jaggers gives just as close and more comfortable of a shave. If this is your first double edge razor and your not happy with it. you may as well stick with the cartridge razors. I don&#x27;t think you can find a better double edge Razor. Make sure you find a blade you are happy with before you give up. DE razor, Shaving Can Be very rewarding , once you learn how to use them.  (tip) watch a few you tube video&#x27;s on, DE shaving.</li>
    <li> This razor is fantastic! Close shave and beautiful chrome! I will definitely be adding more EJ razors to my collection. The handle is quite small as if it were a travel razor but I don&#x27;t mind. Medium aggressive shave.</li>
    <li> UPDATE 10/4/15: Several days ago, the thread that connects the head with the handle actually snapped apart as I tightened it. I&#x27;ve not even used this razor for one year and it abruptly breaks out of the blue. No other cheap plastic razor I&#x27;ve had has ever done this. I am very disappointed to say the least. EJ is supposed to be better than this. However, I&#x27;m only knocking my rating down to two stars because the razor did shave well while it lasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EJ better send me a decent replacement or I will take my business elsewhere. I will *not* accept this kind of poor product quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is shorter and lighter than the picture might suggest, but it&#x27;s durable, easy to wield even with my large hands, and works splendidly. It&#x27;s aggressive enough to give a baby smooth shave with few strokes, but not so aggressive that it&#x27;s too easy to nick yourself. The knurling on the handle is also a plus because it helps your grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind that this model is a three piece design and thus requires more effort in cleaning compared to butterfly style razors. You need to unscrew the top portion, which is itself two pieces that hold the blade, and then clean and dry the components separately before reassembling them. However, I feel it&#x27;s not that much more work and definitely worth the performance of this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless you grow the thickest hair that requires an even more aggressive razor, I think you&#x27;d be very satisfied with this product. I certainly am.</li>
    <li> I just received my Edwin Jagger Kelvin Double Edged Safety Razor yesterday, and used it for the first time this morning.  I am very happy with my purchase.  First I have to say that it is much smaller than I had originally thought.  This is not necessarily a bad thing, just a suprise.  And even though I have relatively large hands, it was not an issue to use.  It has a good heft to it, and the chrome plating appears to be of high quality.  The fit of the head to the handle was tight, and once my blade was in place and tightened, there was no play in the razor.&lt;br /&gt;Though this came with a 5-pack of Derby razors, I had also ordered a pack of Wilkinson Sword Blade razors, and that is what I used for my first shave.  The blade that I use I am certain will affect my overall experience each time, but for the first shave I am very happy with the results. This is also my first time ever shaving with a double-edge razor, so I&#x27;m sure as I acclimate to it, my experience will improve as well.&lt;br /&gt;So far I am please with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Hands down my favorite non-adjustable safety razor. I like the short handle and head heavy feel of the razor. I use it exclusively with Feather blades and get a close comfortable shave consistently. I like the knurling on the handle and find it very easy to control, even with wet hands.</li>
    <li> My first razor. Great safety razor. Shorter than average shavers. Nice weight and balance. The finish is perfect and it shaves great. I would recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> Excellent razor. Love the handle, it&#x27;s the same length as my 1954 Gillette Super Speed but thicker. Gives a great shave.</li>
    <li> I love this razor, great deal, great design. I especially love the length of the handle, since i prefer a shorter handle. For those that are curious, the handle is a little shorter than it looks in the photos. I was surprised when I opened the box, but for me that was a pleasant surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the razor fully assembled, it is pretty close to exactly 3&amp;#34; long. Some might find that too short, but I find it to aid in maneuverability. I like the knurling pattern too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint about this razor is the material it is constructed of. The chrome finish is absolutely beautifully done, no blemishes, super smooth like glass. I am not sure how thick the chrome layer is....but the real problem lies underneath. The zinc alloy material is not really made to last as long as the old days when they made them out of Brass. I only knocked it off 1 star for that, because the price was reasonable at $28. This would be a 2 star reduction at least if it was priced like the Muhle R89, which happens to have the exact same head design and is also made of the same type of material. There are a lot of reviews showing the head cap screw breaking off. I really don&#x27;t think that this will last more than 2 years but it might with caution. I wish they would offer this in at least solid brass or stainless, I would buy that in a heart beat regardless of price. This little guy paid for itself in just over a month&#x27;s use based on what I was paying for the cartridges, and provides a better shave with less irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the level of aggressiveness too. Nice close shave but not overly aggressive. The blades that it came with did not work well for me, Derby, and caused me to think I had made a mistake buying this because those blades were extremely harsh on my face. Once I started trying blades I have found a few that are performing amazing with little to no irritation. I seem to have coarse / wire like facial hair even though its not super thick, but I have very sensitive skin so blade selection is a HUGE factor.ection is a HUGE factor.</li>
    <li> Revised- the handle threading is stripped out and the head will not screw on any longer.   Great size for travel! I like the feel and balance and the shave. The handle is a bit small and takes some getting used to, and the shave is mild. All said, a good price and excellent value.</li>
    <li> Great little razor! Just note that the handle is shorter than most. With that being said, it makes handlng different, but not necessarily in a bad way. I find it to be well balanced. The quality is Edwin Jagger, enough said there.</li>
    <li> Razor is perfect for me.  Slightly more aggressive than the merkur 23c which is what I was looking for.  Baby smooth shave with two passes.  Grip is very good.  The weight of razor is well balanced towards the head and has enough heft.  The short handle is fine and easy to maneuver.  The texture is very nice, just enough to not slip but not sharp feeling and cheap.  I actually really like the way it feels.  Great for a second purchased razor.  This maybe too aggressive a razor for a beginner so do not press down on skin and watch the YouTube vids available.  The Merkur 23c is notably smoother but will not shave as close.  Its a trade off but if you want the baby smooth soft you&#x27;ll need this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 10/6/14:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say I am extremely happy with this razor.  I have recently tried its competition the Merkur HD and it was close but the Edwin clearly is far superior.  The Merkur shaved close but not baby soft.  It was a slightly rougher shave and I used it a few times to make sure all with the same blade I love the Gillette 7o&#x27;clock yellows.  I shaved with the Edwin Jagger again today and I have to say it was the best smoothest shave of my life.  It doesn&#x27;t scrape the skin kicking up tiny little flakes like the Merkur.  Its hard to explain.  But with the Merkur it just doesn&#x27;t feel as soft afterwards even though it shaves almost as close as the edwin.  The gap in the Merkur is smaller but the blade angle is different and more aggressive.  Although the gap in the Edwin is larger the blade angle is milder and this is the right recipe for my face at least.  The skin is left beautifully smooth and SOFT.  All I want to do is show it off for my wife to feel.  She loves it but admittedly is sick of me showing her :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have been using the Proraso pre shave cream, shaving soap and follow up with its lotion all green line.  I use the WSP Prince badger brush and it is far superior to the Parker that gets all the rave here.  Denser and actually is soft and not floppy like that huge Parker.  My search is finally over.  I just bought two more of these suckers for when my son&#x27;s grow up incase they stop making them they are perfect!loppy like that huge Parker.  My search is finally over.  I just bought two more of these suckers for when my son&#x27;s grow up incase they stop making them they are perfect!</li>
    <li> Shorter than the non-Amazon-exclusive EJ I&#x27;ve owned, but the knurling on the handle makes it worth it. Shaves great for me with a variety of blades.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor. It has the perfect weight for a good shave and accepts any DE blade you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is great quality, and was made in Sheffield, UK. For anyone considering a switch to a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; razor, this is a no-risk purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, I love that I can get more blades at my local drug store (if it is an emergency) or 100 blades for $9 - $12 on Amazon.</li>
    <li> The quality was very good. I thought that you replace blades by just twisting the handle and the top would open. Instead you have to completely unscrew the handle and the whole top assembly comes apart. Changing blades is a little awkward and more time consuming than it should be. Also I found the handle was a little short.</li>
    <li> This is way better than the Merkur classic.  It&#x27;s better designed and made.  I have both.  But the Samurai 202 short handle is actually better than this one because of the compact size and its actually heavier.  The heavier the razor, the better it is to shave.  Also, the smaller handle of any razors is easy to maneuver around the fact, giving you more control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Samaurai 202 is first.  Then EJ is second.  Merkur is 3rd.  All else are not worth it.</li>
    <li> My first razor was the Merkur 34 HD... Beautiful tool, not so aggressive as far as blade exposure, but still could not get a blood free neck... Then I went to the EJ89lbl and loved the head but the handle was too long for me...  Then I found the Kelvin... I use the feather, Gillette platinum and recently tried the Dorco 300 with surprisingly great results...    After un-boxing the Kelvin, it was so beautiful until I tried to put a blade in. The handle was on so tight, that I had to get a pair of pliers and pry the handle from the head. It appeared as though some form of cement was around the thread on the male end. I used a automotive wire brush to remove the substance after damaging the handle&#x27;s flawless finish.    I sent the original razor back and just received the replacement...  Everything is in perfect condition...Can&#x27;t stop smiling..</li>
