<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Really small they were not good for my project but I saved them for something else. The colors are not as bright as shown in the picture but they are nice.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed of this product. the pearls are smaller than it looks on the picture and the wheels are not full of pearls (even the picture has a lot of pearls in them). Don&#x27;t let the picture fool you.</li>
    <li> good product but the case i got was barely even half full. other than not getting many its a good product. they dont look cheapely made or anything but theyre smaller than i thought</li>
    <li> These tiny pearls make brides&#x27; nails beautiful and feminine for their special day.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with them. LOVE</li>
    <li> These are  small sized and flat backed.&lt;br /&gt;I got exactly what is pictured.&lt;br /&gt;They are iridescence pearls and are very pretty.&lt;br /&gt;1st time I have EVER received a wheel , from any seller,that is jammed full.&lt;br /&gt; Kudos to the seller for supplying enough.</li>
    <li> I actually purchased these to use in my card-making, not on nails.  They work perfectly, and are a much better price than any craft stores or even local nail stores.</li>
    <li> The container itself is as small as my palm &amp; very few pearls are in the container i&#x27;m certain there isn&#x27;t 1200!&lt;br /&gt;This picture doesn&#x27;t look like the product i recived</li>
    <li> The pictures shows a lot more pearls of each color then what actually come. I still like the colors and will definitely use them!</li>
    <li> The item arrived SUPER fast. The product itself was great in terms of quality. I was a little disappointed in the fact that I was expecting the bins in the wheel to be full but there were barely enough pearls to cover the bottom. This is the only reason for my 3 star rating.</li>
    <li> Just like every one else is saying, the picture is a bit mis leading. In the picture it shows that the wheel is full, but when I received mine they were half full. Wheel comes packaged in a separate piece of sealed plastic, so I was checking to make sure that there was no beads loose, but there was not. Overall, good value for the money.</li>
    <li> I love these little things. I share them with my granddaughter. She used them for her nail art and we both use them for scrapbooking and paper crafts.</li>
    <li> Came as expected, I&#x27;m satisfied with the product, it is a great way to not only decorate your nails but your shoes and phones also, just make sure you use glue instead of clear nail polish to stick them because they will easily fall of like any 3D art that hasn&#x27;t been stabilized.</li>
    <li> I love this wheel of fun. Pretty pearls with the flat back for nail art. There are countless designs to be made with this.</li>
    <li> I am sow pleased with my item, i hope to buymore next time, again thanksum giving you a very good rating</li>
    <li> these are a mix of colors, nice to make different designs on your nails. i liked the color assortment for sure</li>
    <li> I thought that I would get a few pearls, but they were full with pearls and all sorts of colors with it.</li>
    <li> got it was in good shap love it happy to use it and much more of it thank so much</li>
    <li> I added this to my nail design and when I painted the top coat over it, the color ran out of it and all over my nail.  I had to take everything off and re-do it since the color of the pearl ran all over the nail.  Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> I purchased this wheel and a silver wheel. Beware they are very small wheels. Not like the ones at the nail salons. I purchased them for a gift to a friend. I am sure she will like them because I ordered several nail items. Like brushes, and ect. Because of the amount of items I ordered it should take away of the smallness of the wheels...I hope..</li>
    <li> This item took a while to arrive, but it was also smaller than pictured. If you don&#x27;t mind the size too much, the pearls are okay.</li>
    <li> These beads are all the same size but varied in color and the color selection is nice. I love using these for nail decor :)</li>
    <li> This set is kinda great. Pretty much true to the picture. It just took a while to get here. Great for phone case making.</li>
    <li> I love this pearls. They look like&lt;br /&gt;at the picture, maybe a bit lighter in color. I am very satisfied with the amount of pearls.</li>
    <li> I would have given this a 0 star if I could. I received on average about 15 beads for each color.</li>
    <li> I love my different colored pearls stones!!! They are so Beautiful!! Cant wait to use them on my nails !!!</li>
    <li> I like these but the only issue is that I thought the wheel would have more beads than what I received. I mean there is room for more beads to fit. Other than that the colours are pretty although a couple are not exactly like the ones pictured.</li>
    <li> Item came as described in description ..but they were all mixed together and i spent about two hours trying to separate them</li>
    <li> These are very nice and easy to work with.  I just recommend using a sturdy pair of tweezers to grab them.</li>
    <li> I got these on time, which was great especially since they are coming from overseas. I love the contain their in, easy to keep organized. I havent used them yet but I sure they will work fine.</li>
    <li> The colors pictured are not what I received but still okay. 1.5mm the colors are as follows fuchsia, blue, orange/yellow, gray, lt. blue, hot pink, white, red, lt. yellow, lt. purple, black, pale pink. I received them a month after order date, I wish I had the dark purple instead of the gray, and I&#x27;m not too big on the color red either would have wanted the lime green. (I ordered these with a 2mm pack from VIP Beauty Shop 6 Color pearls and I got the exact same thing as this wheel in the same shipping package!!!!) I will be complaining. Quality control is not a strong area with these two pearl wheels. Don&#x27;t get me wrong the pearls are in great shape, but they need to sell what they advertise like everyone else I have ordered from over seas.</li>
    <li> These stones are perfect for nails, and a great variety for the price. Easy to put on nails and fun to look at.</li>
    <li> when recived some of the colored pearls were mixed didnt stay in place but still very good price and u do get the same produce they list loved it</li>
    <li> i have not ussed them yet. it looks better in picture. not alot in package. not too happy. i probably would not order again</li>
    <li> I just received my while of pearls. While the quality looks great, I have yet to use them yet. I was a little disappointed as I was expecting the wheel to be full, there was very little product and the colors were not at all what was shown. I guess you can&#x27;t expect much for $1.50.</li>
    <li> There are not very many pearls and they seem so cheap. Lucky they did not cost much at all. I would not recommend ordering.</li>
    <li> I thought the container would be bigger because it&#x27;s hard to get the pearls out but over all 5 star . (Shipping takes way to long)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so small. I thought it was going to be way bigger. How am I suppose to apply them. ( sad)</li>
    <li> Love the colors package was great  all came in one piece....Love wheels easyaccess to all the colors and the one you are working on....</li>
    <li> I enjoy nail art and bought these beads on a whim. Although they took a while to arrive from Asia (I believe they came from Hong Kong), the product is as described and easy to use.  I recommend applying them with gel super glue to your gel nail polish BEFORE curing then applying the top coat for added strength.  My only knock is that some of the beads (about 10) are imperfect and stuck to one another or are cracked.  Great value and very pretty.</li>
    <li> Love this got them pretty fast and thw size of this are great.. and the price is so good too.. I got three and I am very happy with it..</li>
    <li> Thank you for sending on time and I am so very glad that it was what I needed it made it easy for me</li>
    <li> You just don&#x27;t get as many as pictured...But they&#x27;re still pretty cute to use. A little pricey, but nonetheless, cute...</li>
    <li> They came in today and i was disappointed! Only has 5 colors ( hot pink, tan, pink, baby blue and white ) and the container is not even full ! Wish i can post a pic of it so u guys can see how bad it is! Dont buy this its a waste of money! The picture is fake it doesnt even look like that :(</li>
    <li> THEY ARE TOO SMALL, AND THEY DON&#x27;T LOOK LIKE THE PICTURE, YOU CAN BARELY SEE THEM, WHAT A RIP OFF.</li>
    <li> The picture shows more product than what they gave me. On the picture it looks like each color of beads can last for a while because there are so many. What I got was like a trial size amount. Good for one use...if you&#x27;re lucky to be able to create something out of it.</li>
    <li> Excellent little half pearls. I love the vibrant colors. They are a really nice size for small designs.&lt;br /&gt;Would consider getting more if needed</li>
    <li> Reeeeally small container and I received about 15 of each color. Big let down. Next time I will check who its shipped from. Hong Kong is such a rip off. Going to the craft store</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Of course its not going to come with complete full bins because its small and its for your nails. Good product. Thank You</li>
    <li> I ordered a ton of these, and they came quickly and in good condition. I had an issue with one of them being mixed up but just separated them and all was well. All the colors matched perfectly. I recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> well they came later than i expected and there very small i thought they would be bigger because i have big hands and i just cant hold them and less pearls came</li>
    <li> I ordered this sometime in December, together with some other items, Im still waiting on it and another one, that I had ordered the same time, I am not using this for nail art though.</li>
    <li> Love them and the colors. Can&#x27;t wait to use them. Not sure why people are complaining that they are small considering its nail art. What did u expect?!</li>
    <li> I like the variety of the colors as well as the size of the pearls. Great for the price.</li>
    <li> i HAVE USED THEM ON MY TOES, AND ON MY NIECE&#x27;S HANDS THEY ARE NICE. WELL WORTH IT. VERY CHEAP. WENT TO SALLY&#x27;S BEAUTY SUPPLY A FEW DAYS AGO, AND FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT WITH WAYY LESS PRODUCT COST CLOSE TO 10$ OH NO, i WAS THINKING IN MY HEAD THAT THEY ARE TRICKING SO MANY PEOPLE, I ACTUALLY FEEL BAD!!!</li>
    <li> Great selection and wheel makes this product very easy to use and keep rhinestone separated appropriately.  Loved this item, it was great!!</li>
    <li> The pearls were a lot smaller than I thought they would be. I should have realized this, I have multiple nail wheels, but it was still a little bit disheartening when they arrived. There are also a lot less than I thought there were going to be. If this was one of the less than a dollar products, I would have been chill with that, but they are a little more in terms of nail stuff and I was not expecting it. They are good quality though and work as well as I expected.</li>
    <li> They are round hard to put on maybe its just me but i don&#x27;t really like them thats just me.</li>
    <li> Item was nothing like the picture of bright colors, they were pale pastel colors. Wasn&#x27;t 12 different colors either, was only 10 with 2 colors repeating. Hardly any in the wheel except the pastel green, that one was half full but most were barely covering the bottom of the container. Guess it was worth the price. Disappointed in this item and won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I wish I would have read the reviews first each sections had about tens beads not filled to the top like the picture although they are pretty one color only fills up 1/4 of my nail waste of my time waiting for item and money.</li>
    <li> These little pearls are so fun. I&#x27;ve affixed them a couple of different ways.  I have used a layer of clear polish to set them when I was just adding them as a small accent to a design and clear coated them to seal them in place, and I have also used them in creating a &#x27;junk&#x27; nail.  For the &#x27;junk&#x27; nail I used nail glue.  They work good either way. the colors are truly pictured her.  After some abrasion form every day use of your hands, some of the color does rub off, but that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
    <li> Very cute. I like all the colors, they look good on my nails. I pick them up with my white rhinestone pen.</li>
    <li> Great quality &amp; will definitely order again in the future</li>
    <li> nothing like what it looks like. super tiny....colors are not the same. the amount of pearls is very small. i thought they would be bigger but not</li>
    <li> These are SO pretty. They can be elegant or playful. Some do have excess product around the rim making them in useable but most are great. Color lasts, product was shipped on time with no problems. Will order again when I am out!!</li>
    <li> I got &amp;#34;Cheeky&amp;#34; brand pearls - the colors are slightly different and the pearls are actually a little bit smaller than 2mm, but I really love them. I think the colors are even prettier than the picture, and I like smaller embellishments since I have small fingers, so...great!</li>
    <li> Pearls are very small and spaces are not full as shown on picture. Ordered other things at the same time from Hong Kong and received a week later, but these people took forever to ship out.</li>
    <li> The  picture  shown does not really shows what you&#x27;ll receive.  Very  disappointed with the product.!!!!!!!!!! Do  not  buy it or think about it twice.</li>
    <li> Smaller than I thought but this adds a little elegance for a small price... not a bad buy at all</li>
    <li> Love them I thought they would be bigger but it all good they work just fine and I able to make a lot of different designs thank you I&#x27;m a happy camper</li>
    <li> I love the pearls and how they come different sizes , easy to use for my nails . I love them just ordered 3 more wheels of them .</li>
    <li> Awesome! I love these awesome pearls they are so cute and handy.</li>
    <li> I love these pearls, they are different from the usual rhinestones used as nail art.  I used these pearls to enhance my floral designs on my nails.</li>
    <li> The colors I got were different from the picture, I got: lavender, pale yellow, black, white, fuchsia, pale pink, emerald green, silver, light green, goldenrod, deep blue, light blue.  Unlike the picture, where they&#x27;re all tiny, the emerald, silver, and goldenrod pearls in mine are about 4 X the size of the other beads. Also, when they arrived, a lot of the beads were mixed up in their compartments a bit. It wasn&#x27;t a huge deal, I just sorted the strays with my tweezers, it only took a couple of minutes.&lt;br /&gt;The shipping says it takes 17-28 business days (which is a LONG time), it&#x27;s shipped all the way from Hong Kong. Mine came 9 days before I was expecting it, which was quite nice :)</li>
    <li> Received very quick. Quality good.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re  all so tiny but for the price one can&#x27;t  complain...</li>
    <li> They are great quality and the size is just perfect for my acrylic nail powder flowers and the colors are just nice a lot to choose from:)</li>
    <li> I was not expecting this tiny package. I should have read the description better. BUT, I love the colors more than the Rhinestones Beads size.</li>
    <li> It is MUCH smaller than I anticipated. For the almost $7 I would think it would&#x27;ve been bigger.  The picture also shows each section is full.. not in this case. I always buy from Amazon and this is the first time I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
    <li> These are very pretty and a great addition to my Nail Art decorations.  I was disappointed they too over 4 weeks to get here and there is no way of knowing when you are purchasing something from Hong Kong until after you make the purchase.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much considering how cheap it was, so I was happy to see that the wheel was half full instead of having just a few pearls like some people got. Considering how expensive these nail art pearls can get where I live, I still think it&#x27;s a good deal for this product.</li>
    <li> The wheel is a lot smaller than i expected, like these size of my little girl palm....smaller than my cats head, smaller than the bottom of my water bottle, along with the pearls. Also the colours are off, by a lot. It arrived super fast though. I guess you get what you pay for</li>
    <li> The product came with all the colors mixed up. They are as described, but the chore of sorting them was unexpected. Their quality is a bit shabby but I can work with them.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use the product yet but they are very nice.  The container is very useful and necessary.</li>
    <li> I like these a lot they look really cute on my nails. The only thing that I didnt like was that when they shipped they got a &amp;#34;static charge&amp;#34; and they stick to the plastic top. I had to spin the top around to get them unstuck from the top and now they are good.</li>
    <li> These are so small..and you only get about 15 of each color... However still very cute.. And perfect for nails. I think these are too small for cellphone cases...</li>
    <li> These pearls were fine except for the fact that they gave me like 15 in each and not even close to as much as in the picture. The colors were dull and i was super disappointed. Overall they were good.</li>
    <li> They are very very small, much smaller than I thought they would be. The wheel is also not nearly as full as shown. The colors are still super cute though, and I WILL be using them. However, I&#x27;ll have to look on ebay for some bigger pearls now.</li>
    <li> Again, I always seem to think they should be larger.  but they are cute and I like the different colors.</li>
    <li> In this pic it clearly shows each wheel being filled with 12 colors, my wheel is barely filled! I know you get what you pay for but this is cheap, even for what I paid for! There may be 12-15 pearl beads per compartment, but no more! DONT BOTHER, I waited over a month for this garbage!</li>
    <li> Use these flat pearls for craft projects.  They are about 3mm in size.  On the downside, the wheel is hard to turn and if not careful there will be pearls ALL OVER!</li>
    <li> I ordered my beads in February and I received them about a week later. Which was a pleasant surprise. I like the beads, they are really cute.  The give my nails art a little extra pop! I just wished they came in a larger quantity.</li>
    <li> I like them but still haven&#x27;t used them or know what I&#x27;m gonna use them on. Will deside soon hopefully..</li>
    <li> When I got it, it only has less stone in each case, not as what I expect to have....too less!!!! I can only say a few!</li>
    <li> Like many other reviews stated, there are not a ton of pearls in the package. I got around 20 of each color. There was a nice selection of colors and the item arrived quickly. Great for the price!</li>
    <li> I received these pearls and they come small but the colors differ from the picture which is good lol I didn&#x27;t want orange but there useful for deco-den and other things I love mine</li>
    <li> My clients have enjoyed these ,they are really tiny but a great price to add to my nail art collection for my clients.</li>
    <li> I enjoy doing my own nail designs and although it took forever and a day for this item to arrive, I was pleased with these pearl stones. They are the same size as regular rhinestones and just as easy to apply.</li>
    <li> Came I&#x27;m early and it looks like the sizes vary slightly ! Perfect for pedicures on my small toes ! Already used them and I&#x27;ve got some compliments ! Amazing</li>
    <li> Picture is not at all what I received. Was very disappointed. Will not be ordering from again. Was really hoping to be able to use this product on my clients.</li>
    <li> You wait for so long. You finally get it and there are maybe 10 stones per color. Not bright like shown, very light. I won&#x27;t buy from this seller again. Good thing it was only a dollar. Well never use these as I wanted bright stones. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> it nice i didnt get to use it because  i lost it but that ok i ind it one day lol good for the price</li>
    <li> I wish I could give 0 stars. Instead of these I got fake flower petals. I wish I never bought them</li>
    <li> This is awfull I didn&#x27;t even get the right order! I got a pack a craft beads not even worth a dollar! Do not buy this product it is awful</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> I just received my color pearls there super little but I haven&#x27;t used them yet . I&#x27;m sure there still do the job but just keep in mind before you buy them there very small.</li>
    <li> Such an assortment of colors and they came on time and the price was good. I will definitely reorder these when needed.</li>
    <li> I was astounded to see the tiny size of the container...a little larger than a quarter coin. Plus the beads are micro tiny and scarce. Each slot in container is less than half empty...wish they were at least full of little beads. $10 total cost with shipping ...I though was too much for such a small amount of product...I think I wasted my money :( not a satisfied customer</li>
    <li> I love doing my nails and getting this nail supply make it better both at home n in the nail salon. I love them and also they look cool to.</li>
    <li> So far these are the best pearl style rhinestones I have tried. Sizing is true. Great mix of colors as well.</li>
    <li> i love them on my nailt and my phone cases great complements love them will be orderiing again soon l</li>
    <li> Cheap nail pearls that are exactly what you can expect them to be.  I thought it was a good amount for the money and the colors are all pretty.</li>
    <li> I wish I had read some of the other reviews before purchasing.  I usually do but for some reason(probably the price) I just bought it without looking.  As other reviewers state, when it arrives it looks nothing like the picture in terms of fullness.  The wheel is more empty than it is full.  It looks like there are 20 of each color.  2 stars for a very misleading picture.</li>
    <li> So many different colors for nail design. This has lasted a long time for multiple uses. Will but again in the future.</li>
    <li> I am happy with the beautiful color of these pearl beads.  They will be a wonderful addition to the nail art collection I am building.  Packaged tight and fast delivery.</li>
