      <li>It&#x27;s by far my favorite powder!!!</li>

      <li>Use this with the Bella Terra Make-up Primer and love both of them...</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>and they all love it.  </li>
      <li>I recommended to so many friends</li>
      <li>I should be able to find make-up</li>
      <li>This is much better in my opinion.</li>
      <li>and i said okay.  </li>
      <li>Love it.  </li>
      <li>I love how this powder makeup looks on me, it covers some blemishes</li>
      <li>Anyway I love this product, bought it again, and will keep buying it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad i did though</li>
      <li>I have healthy skin.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t make me break out (rash or acne), covers very nicely, the tone I chose matched perfectly (much to my surprise), and doesn&#x27;t need touched up during the day.  </li>
      <li>I tend to beak out easily with most face makeup..but not with Bella Terra.</li>
      <li>i love how this covers and goes on smoothly</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never had a foundation I&#x27;ve loved THIS much.  </li>
      <li>love this makeup, get a lot of compliments and it is so fabulous looking to wear and enjoy it as wll</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very happy to say I now wear make-up everyday :)</li>
      <li>It has a light coverage -</li>
      <li>Great for your skin, covers so well and last all day.</li>
      <li>like it will not cover a bruise but does make your face look good while still maintaining a natural look.</li>
      <li>first tried out the product in Houston at a booth in the Mall, so I was pleased</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s worth that price, not the $60.00 or the $100.00!</li>
      <li>Love this makeup and fast shipping</li>
      <li>Bella Terra was intended to be my replacement powder, but after ordering it (and spending more than 2x as much)</li>
      <li>and so i have been trying to find something that was gentle and didnt cake up and didnt cause more breakouts.</li>
      <li>Love it, very natural</li>
      <li>I was first introduced to it in a mall kiosk and have worn nothing else since!  </li>
      <li>Love this product..looks so natural!</li>
      <li>I love the natural feel and coverage it gives.  </li>
      <li>Watts Beauty was by far the best all around and least expensive (Double Win!), but I haven&#x27;t been able to find my shade anywhere.  </li>
      <li>I bought my first container at the kiosk in the mall</li>
      <li>and I rarely miss a day when I don&#x27;t need make up since I am still in real estate.  </li>
      <li>In less than 4 hours, the foundation floated off most of my face and landed in my fine lines, wrinkles, and around my nose.  </li>
      <li>obvious reasons, having added shimmer to a product that also makes me oilier than normal, is kind of disaster.  </li>
      <li>I am very prone to allergic reactions and acne.  </li>
      <li>Fast service</li>
      <li>It covers very well.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have shiny and sparkling add-ons that give you that “glow” but that only work for perfectly smooth skin.  </li>
      <li>I like it better than any other mineral product out there.</li>
      <li>I would only wear make-up on special occasions.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product, I&#x27;m 40 by the way.</li>
      <li>but I firmly believe this is better.</li>
      <li>If you have sensitive skin try this one out!</li>
      <li>especially when i bought my first one at a mall kiosk...</li>
      <li>I should have known to walk away completely when the girl tried to sell it to me for $100.00!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in my early sixties, and hope I can continue to purchase and wear it.</li>
      <li>Well, that gets old.  </li>
      <li>I am 60 years old.  </li>
      <li>I am 74 years old</li>
      <li>The old foundation I used for 7 years only had 3 natural ingredients in it, and it still made me break out in acne a couple days after using it.  </li>
      <li>I have tried Bare Minerals</li>
      <li>the other hand, it didn&#x27;t get really cake-y</li>

<li> The old foundation I used for 7 years only had 3 natural ingredients in it, and it still made me break out in acne a couple days after using it.  </li>
<li> I have tried Bare Minerals</li>
<li> the other hand, it didn&#x27;t get really cake-y</li>
<li> If you have little wrinkles and lines they will be highlighted and even those that you can’t see normally will be noticeable.  </li>
<li> What is really helpful is that this one small container lasts me over one year</li>
<li> I have a LOT of trouble finding mineral foundations for my sensitive skin.  </li>
<li> Have used several different brands of mineral powder make up over the last few years, but this is my fav....</li>
<li> In the last few years, I&#x27;ve used Bare Minerals/Bare Escentuals, Physicians Formula, and Watts Beauty.  </li>
<li> I can only imagine how quickly this stuff would fail in the summer months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> To cover dark spots you may need a little extra right on the spot with a small detail brush.  </li>
<li> and it didn&#x27;t seem to make my pores look bigger, which has definitely been a complaint with Bare Minerals and Physicians Formula.  </li>
<li> My husband hates when I wear makeup, but he actually complimented the other day when I was wearing it.</li>
<li> The overall face may need a little refreshment by the end of the day</li>
<li> Never using other types of cosmetics.</li>
<li> I have a little dark spot in one of my cheeks that I make disappear with this product.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over a month now, and have had no breakouts.  </li>
<li> So I poked around the internet, did a little research, and decided to give this stuff a try.  </li>
<li> the price was unbelievable...</li>
<li> I compared it to what I had received in the past,</li>
<li> I can wear everyday, no matter what my skin type!  </li>
<li> I have oily skin and this foundation not only failed to control shine, it seemed to make my skin even worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
<li> It also doesnt give that crazy glow that Bare minerals does.</li>
<li> However, at least those products managed to stay on my face.  </li>

    <li> Love this product. Give me the flaw looks.</li>
    <li> i love how this covers and goes on smoothly</li>

    <li> I love this product!  It is the best makeup I&#x27;ve ever used and the color is perfect.</li>

    <li> Love this product..looks so natural! I tend to beak out easily with most face makeup..but not with Bella Terra.</li>
    <li> Have used Bellla Terra mineral foundation for a number of years. I was first introduced to it in a mall kiosk and have worn nothing else since!  I love the natural feel and coverage it gives.  I&#x27;m in my early sixties, and hope I can continue to purchase and wear it.</li>
    <li> love this makeup, get a lot of compliments and it is so fabulous looking to wear and enjoy it as wll</li>
    <li> love this makeup easy to apply, and good coverage.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for years.  I am 60 years old.  I have healthy skin.  This does not clog pores or cause your wrinkles to show like a lot of makeup.</li>
    <li> the price was unbelievable...especially when i bought my first one at a mall kiosk...NEVER AGAIN!  I should have known to walk away completely when the girl tried to sell it to me for $100.00!  Then when I said no way, she gave me a &amp;#34;deal&amp;#34; of $60.00 and i said okay.  I found this on Amazon for $32.00 including the shipping! it&#x27;s worth that price, not the $60.00 or the $100.00! This is really good stuff!  i just put moisterizer and a pat of this stuff!  Voila! flawless and ready to head out!</li>
    <li> Excellent would recommend!</li>
    <li> Ever since I started to use this product my face doesnt break out. My skin is more beautiful and glowing. Never using other types of cosmetics. If you have sensitive skin try this one out!</li>
    <li> Great price  I loved it</li>
    <li> So far the best mineral foundation I&#x27;ve found out there.  It doesn&#x27;t have shiny and sparkling add-ons that give you that “glow” but that only work for perfectly smooth skin.  If you have little wrinkles and lines they will be highlighted and even those that you can’t see normally will be noticeable.  This product doesn’t do that.  It covers great and coverage lasts all day.  I have a little dark spot in one of my cheeks that I make disappear with this product.  It is still gone by the end of the day.  The overall face may need a little refreshment by the end of the day but coverage remains.  To cover dark spots you may need a little extra right on the spot with a small detail brush.  Anyway I love this product, bought it again, and will keep buying it.</li>
    <li> This gives great coverage and color.  I like it better than any other mineral product out there. I have some age spots and it even worked well in covering those !</li>
    <li> Nice coverage and color. Fast service</li>
    <li> I love Bella Terra!! This is my first time buying online and this product is great! I bought my first container at the kiosk in the mall and i wont do that again! I&#x27;m glad i did though so i could see how wonderful it is. This lasts forever also! It covers very well. I have acne damage to my skin and so i have been trying to find something that was gentle and didnt cake up and didnt cause more breakouts. This is perfect. It also doesnt give that crazy glow that Bare minerals does. I am oily already and dont need extra shine. This is much better in my opinion.</li>
    <li> In the last few years, I&#x27;ve used Bare Minerals/Bare Escentuals, Physicians Formula, and Watts Beauty.  Watts Beauty was by far the best all around and least expensive (Double Win!), but I haven&#x27;t been able to find my shade anywhere.  Bella Terra was intended to be my replacement powder, but after ordering it (and spending more than 2x as much), I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;d recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) There is no mention anywhere in the product description that the foundation has a shimmer to it.&lt;br /&gt;2) I have oily skin and this foundation not only failed to control shine, it seemed to make my skin even worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For obvious reasons, having added shimmer to a product that also makes me oilier than normal, is kind of disaster.  Coating my face in shellac probably would have left me with the same result.  In less than 4 hours, the foundation floated off most of my face and landed in my fine lines, wrinkles, and around my nose.  AND THIS WAS IN OCTOBER!!  I can only imagine how quickly this stuff would fail in the summer months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, it didn&#x27;t get really cake-y and it didn&#x27;t seem to make my pores look bigger, which has definitely been a complaint with Bare Minerals and Physicians Formula.  However, at least those products managed to stay on my face.  Back to the drawing board...</li>
    <li> If you want to just tweak your look this is perfect.  It has a light coverage - like it will not cover a bruise but does make your face look good while still maintaining a natural look.</li>
    <li> I have a LOT of trouble finding mineral foundations for my sensitive skin.  I am very prone to allergic reactions and acne.  The old foundation I used for 7 years only had 3 natural ingredients in it, and it still made me break out in acne a couple days after using it.  I would only wear make-up on special occasions.  Well, that gets old.  I should be able to find make-up I can wear everyday, no matter what my skin type!  So I poked around the internet, did a little research, and decided to give this stuff a try.  I absolutely LOVE it!  I&#x27;ve never had a foundation I&#x27;ve loved THIS much.  Doesn&#x27;t make me break out (rash or acne), covers very nicely, the tone I chose matched perfectly (much to my surprise), and doesn&#x27;t need touched up during the day.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over a month now, and have had no breakouts.  I&#x27;m very happy to say I now wear make-up everyday :)</li>
    <li> I love how this powder makeup looks on me, it covers some blemishes but if you wear the eye primer underneath to cover redness, pimples, or scars then you will get a more flawless coverage. I will recommend this makeup powder.</li>
    <li> Have been using the product for quite a while, it was a re-order.&lt;br /&gt;I first tried out the product in Houston at a booth in the Mall, so I was pleased&lt;br /&gt;that I could reorder on-line.</li>
    <li> Love it, very natural</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic light powder make up that gives excellent coverage.  I am 74 years old so I don&#x27;t want make up that gets in all the cracks and crevices and stays all day, and this is it.  What is really helpful is that this one small container lasts me over one year and I rarely miss a day when I don&#x27;t need make up since I am still in real estate.  I have tried Bare Minerals but I firmly believe this is better.</li>
    <li> Love it.  My husband hates when I wear makeup, but he actually complimented the other day when I was wearing it.</li>
    <li> my wife looked all over for this make up and shes happy she finaly found it she loves the quality</li>
    <li> Great mineral foundation won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this product from this supplier before and haven&#x27;t had any problems, but this time I ordered TWO of 8 gram foundations in Nutmeg and it isn&#x27;t even close to the color I wear. I compared it to what I had received in the past, (which was exactly the same as I had purchased from Bella Terra in the past) and it not even close, it had a very yellow tone. I feel as though I have been ripped off buy this supplier and will not order again. BEWARE! I would have returned it if i hadn&#x27;t take the oversized bar code sticker off the bottom. I might still try.</li>
    <li> Great for your skin, covers so well and last all day. I highly recommend this product, I&#x27;m 40 by the way.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a 2nd time I am purchasing it.  It&#x27;s by far my favorite powder!!! I recommended to so many friends and they all love it.  No need for foundation I put my moisturizer and powder and my skin looks flawless and not dry</li>
