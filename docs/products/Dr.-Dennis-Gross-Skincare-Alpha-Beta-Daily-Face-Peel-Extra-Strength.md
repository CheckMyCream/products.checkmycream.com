      <li>With the department store ones, I used it on my face for more than 2 minutes and neck for 2, and it would still be moist.</li>
      <li>Works great, can really tell a difference.</li>
      <li>im satisfied</li>
      <li>Love, love love these.</li>
      <li>So - I used to love these.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how many compliments I get on my complexion.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!</li>
      <li>a beautiful glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t have to use the SkinCeuticals products to get that same glow</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t write many reviews, but if a product has really affected my life to the point I would be devastated if it was discontinued, I figured I&#x27;d better.</li>
      <li>Just make sure you don&#x27;t have a wedding or something to go to during the first week or two.</li>
      <li>Completely clean my face before bed and prepare it for the overnight serum.</li>
      <li>Overall, its a good product.  </li>
      <li>Makes my face feel clean and smooth, but didn&#x27;t see any really changes.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Nothing will ever get my smooth skin back, but consistent use of this product makes an amazing difference.</li>
      <li>It hasn&#x27;t really done anything for the fine lines between my brows and around my mouth.</li>
      <li>I used to have amazing skin and in recent years had a bacterial infection that literally created boils all over my face.</li>
      <li>This is an amazing daily peel.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
      <li>I rarely ever get any pimples anymore, and when I do I wipe it with these</li>
      <li>Easy to use, helped with my complexion, lasted a long time and arrived quickly!</li>
      <li>I used more frequently in beginning, I&#x27;ve been using for almost 2 years now, and prob use just twice a week (unless having an unusual breakout like I mentioned).</li>
      <li>Seriously you guys, I&#x27;ve used EVERY product out there and the natural stuff is the best you&#x27;re gonna do - not this overpriced snake oil.</li>
      <li>Took about a month to really see results but so worth it.</li>
      <li>I love Dr. Gross products and these are my absolute MUST have.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about two months, and I have really seen a difference in my skin.  </li>
      <li>Your skin will look so much brighter and healthier.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference after using this product for weeks.  </li>
      <li>Would recommend for a daily refresher so moisturizer goes on smooth and so does makeup</li>
      <li>It is a two step process and does not take much time at all.  </li>
      <li>Used to get a good discount on Amazon, however, it&#x27;s back to full price in the whole line of Dr. Dennis Gross, no incentive to buy from Amazon other than home delivery.</li>
      <li>My skin had a healthy glow after using the product and it kept my acne cleared up but did nothing for the dark spots.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t live without these!</li>
      <li>This product makes my skin very smooth, but my step 1 container was missing 4 pads.</li>
      <li>My skin is so smooth after starting them only after a couple days of using them.</li>
      <li>It leaves my skin very soft.</li>
      <li>After you get through that period your skin will adjust and become very soft and clear.</li>
      <li>It is the only thing that truly works and if you have insurance and/or get the generic Retin-A, it is so much cheaper.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I carefully separated the pads for use each night and I am sure that 4 were missing.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin and rosacea, and this extra strength doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
      <li>Once you are finished with the second step you should wait till your face naturally dries and apply your makeup.  </li>
      <li>Not sure that I saw any true benefits.</li>
      <li>I first tried this product a couple of months ago after having some trouble with breakouts after using Murad.  </li>
      <li>I get the same benefit from these pads when cut in half as I do with them whole.</li>
      <li>These pads are much thinner and smaller than the single use packets so it was harder to apply.  </li>
      <li>When you first start using it be prepared for about 4/5 days of extremely tight, dry, flaky skin.</li>

<li> The single use foil packets are about the same price</li>
<li> I understand price increase, but a product going from $ 0.88 per application to $ 1.33  ($0.45 increase) is a genuine rip-off!</li>
<li> didnt hurt my skin like other products and i instantly noticed an improvement in my scars and skin texture and tone.</li>
<li> I will keep using this as long as I can afford it!</li>
<li> I am obsessed and it really makes your skin soft and glowing.  </li>
<li> I like the single use sheets.</li>
<li> you do decide to try this product, you can cut the pads in half to make it last twice as long.</li>
<li> The pads are a lot smaller than what I purchased in department store, about half the size.</li>
<li> The second time around after using for two months has made little improvement.</li>
<li> They were also soaking wet</li>
<li> See other reviews not just here, but Sephora and all over the web.</li>
<li> Not sure if it is the same seller fulfilled by amazon.</li>
<li> I used for a couple of months then stopped due to cost and then started using them again.</li>
<li> I can compromise in other areas of my beauty routine, but I won&#x27;t compromise with this!</li>
<li> Cut them in half to save on cost.</li>
<li> Jacking up the price isn&#x27;t going to make their product a success-people will buy less or switch brands.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m pretty disappointing.</li>
<li> But the ones I bought in amazon dried out in about 2 minutes.</li>
<li> At any age, I can say that use of this product will definitely make a dramatic difference in the appearance of your skin.</li>
<li> Sometimes I get lazy with my nightly routine</li>
<li> The result is huge pits as if I&#x27;d had the worst case of pox and scratched them all off.</li>
<li> As far as wrinkles and hyperpigmentation goes, this stuff doesn&#x27;t work - and it&#x27;s not just me being disappointed (although I am, and $82 lighter)</li>
<li> Just wish they weren&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s too expensive to keep using just to see if it works over time.</li>
<li> Is it a fake?</li>
<li> This turned out to be a disappointment.  </li>
<li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product!  </li>
<li> I was very disappointed that for this price I did not get what I paid for.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not sure that I saw any true benefits. I used it for about a month.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It makes my skin so smooth and bright!</li>
    <li> Excellent exfoliator!</li>
    <li> This product makes my skin very smooth, but my step 1 container was missing 4 pads. I was very disappointed that for this price I did not get what I paid for. I carefully separated the pads for use each night and I am sure that 4 were missing.</li>
    <li> Great product! Great price! I have used it before, but this is the best price I have seen!</li>
    <li> I first tried this product a couple of months ago after having some trouble with breakouts after using Murad.  I purchased the 14 day trial from Sephora and loved the results.  Looking for a better price for the product I came to amazon and purchased the 30 day treatments.  These pads are much thinner and smaller than the single use packets so it was harder to apply.  They were also soaking wet so you have to wring them out before using.  The single use foil packets are about the same price so I started purchasing that instead of the jars.  Overall, its a good product.  My breakouts went away and also the splotchy redness.  It leaves my skin very soft. It hasn&#x27;t really done anything for the fine lines between my brows and around my mouth.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, helped with my complexion, lasted a long time and arrived quickly! I recommend it to be part of routine.</li>
    <li> I do like the way it makes my face feel.  I noticed this because i stopped using it then started back. My skin missed it!</li>
    <li> Best exfoliant out there, and I&#x27;m a product junkie. Your skin will look so much brighter and healthier.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon is the cheapest place to buy it, I researched extensively!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing daily peel.  I use it with a day off for a weekly glycolic peel and couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results.</li>
    <li> Love, love love these. Just wish they weren&#x27;t so expensive. Completely clean my face before bed and prepare it for the overnight serum. I have noticed a difference after four weeks with brighter clearer skin.</li>
    <li> It works.  You can feel your skin reacting to the ingredients.  I like the single use sheets.</li>
    <li> Seriously you guys, I&#x27;ve used EVERY product out there and the natural stuff is the best you&#x27;re gonna do - not this overpriced snake oil. As far as wrinkles and hyperpigmentation goes, this stuff doesn&#x27;t work - and it&#x27;s not just me being disappointed (although I am, and $82 lighter) but SCIENCE says so.&lt;br /&gt;Save your money and buy witch hazel and you&#x27;ll get the same results.</li>
    <li> Love this!  I can compromise in other areas of my beauty routine, but I won&#x27;t compromise with this!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t write many reviews, but if a product has really affected my life to the point I would be devastated if it was discontinued, I figured I&#x27;d better. This stuff is amazing. I rarely ever get any pimples anymore, and when I do I wipe it with these and it&#x27;s gone the next day. I can&#x27;t tell you how many compliments I get on my complexion. I used more frequently in beginning, I&#x27;ve been using for almost 2 years now, and prob use just twice a week (unless having an unusual breakout like I mentioned). Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!</li>
    <li> Makes my face feel clean and smooth, but didn&#x27;t see any really changes. Would recommend for a daily refresher so moisturizer goes on smooth and so does makeup</li>
    <li> i just used it just for 3 days ..im satisfied&lt;br /&gt;maybe i can order again...im looking for day and night cream</li>
    <li> I love Dr. Gross products and these are my absolute MUST have.</li>
    <li> Works great, can really tell a difference. Used to get a good discount on Amazon, however, it&#x27;s back to full price in the whole line of Dr. Dennis Gross, no incentive to buy from Amazon other than home delivery. Can get anywhere for the same price. Major disappointment after more than a year of ordering.</li>
    <li> Dr. Dennis Gross skincare products are a daily regime.  I use the moisture tint and that is all I use on my face after cleaning it.  When I use the Alpha Beta Face Peel I use an exfoliating cleanser and then use the face peel.  It is a two step process and does not take much time at all.  Step one face peel pad will tingle a bit but don&#x27;t worry it just means it&#x27;s doing its job. Once you are finished with the second step you should wait till your face naturally dries and apply your makeup.  Do not use any retinol products that night or the next morning after the face peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to use after my peel SkinCeuticals CF Phloretin and Hydrating B5 Gel.  My face after the peel simply glows!  Not greasy but a beautiful glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t have to use the SkinCeuticals products to get that same glow but it all helps for a happier and healthy face.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product!  I am obsessed and it really makes your skin soft and glowing.  I use it every morning and have seen a change in my skin.  I will continue using and would tell anyone that asked to buy it!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> So - I used to love these. I used for a couple of months then stopped due to cost and then started using them again. The second time around after using for two months has made little improvement. I&#x27;m pretty disappointing. I don&#x27;t know if the formula has changed or my face has decided these just aren&#x27;t working anymore. Either way, I&#x27;ve moved onto another product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this before and it&#x27;s excellent. Amazon has the best price on it.</li>
    <li> This turned out to be a disappointment.  It came recommended by a make up artist, plus it got good reviews here so I decided to give it a try.  One month later and I don&#x27;t see any changes. I stopped using my Retin-A  so I could try this but that was a big mistake.  Now My acne is flaring up all over again.&lt;br /&gt;From now on I am sticking with Retin-A. It is the only thing that truly works and if you have insurance and/or get the generic Retin-A, it is so much cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;If you do decide to try this product, you can cut the pads in half to make it last twice as long.</li>
    <li> My skin had a healthy glow after using the product and it kept my acne cleared up but did nothing for the dark spots.  It&#x27;s too expensive to keep using just to see if it works over time.</li>
    <li> Really love these. See other reviews not just here, but Sephora and all over the web. I used to have amazing skin and in recent years had a bacterial infection that literally created boils all over my face. The result is huge pits as if I&#x27;d had the worst case of pox and scratched them all off. Actually it&#x27;s worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing will ever get my smooth skin back, but consistent use of this product makes an amazing difference. At any age, I can say that use of this product will definitely make a dramatic difference in the appearance of your skin.</li>
    <li> Best skin peel available without a doctors appointment!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference after using this product for weeks.  Don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
    <li> Cut them in half to save on cost. I get the same benefit from these pads when cut in half as I do with them whole. I actually have at times cut the pads into thirds. More bang for your buck!</li>
    <li> My essential product. I have very sensitive skin and rosacea, and this extra strength doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. exceelent product.</li>
    <li> good but not gold! 90 applications for the same product (step 1 and 2) was the same price only 2 months ago, and now you get 60 applications (step 1 and 2) for that price.I understand price increase, but a product going from $ 0.88 per application to $ 1.33  ($0.45 increase) is a genuine rip-off! Jacking up the price isn&#x27;t going to make their product a success-people will buy less or switch brands.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about two months, and I have really seen a difference in my skin.  I saw an improvement within a couple of days.  My skin is clearer, brighter, and smoother.  Love it.</li>
    <li> My girlfriends are asking me what I&#x27;m doing differently...they all are using this poduct now!</li>
    <li> Really great product! I am in my mid 30s and all the sudden started getting breakouts. I went to get a cleansing facial and bought this product after trying it. Took about a month to really see results but so worth it. No breakouts, smaller pores and a glow to my skin. I will keep using this as long as I can afford it!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! My acne scars are fading, my skin is glowing, and all in all my skin looks and feels amazing!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without these! My skin is so smooth after starting them only after a couple days of using them. Sometimes I get lazy with my nightly routine but I always go back to using them.</li>
    <li> This is my fourth order for this product. When you first start using it be prepared for about 4/5 days of extremely tight, dry, flaky skin. After you get through that period your skin will adjust and become very soft and clear. Just make sure you don&#x27;t have a wedding or something to go to during the first week or two. I also suggest using it at night before bed because of the temporary redness to your face. You&#x27;ll wake in the morning loving your skin.</li>
    <li> Love this product too expensive tho</li>
    <li> loved this stuff. didnt hurt my skin like other products and i instantly noticed an improvement in my scars and skin texture and tone.</li>
    <li> I bought it a couple of months ago. Not sure if it is the same seller fulfilled by amazon. The pads are a lot smaller than what I purchased in department store, about half the size. With the department store ones, I used it on my face for more than 2 minutes and neck for 2, and it would still be moist. But the ones I bought in amazon dried out in about 2 minutes. It does not seem as effect as well. Is it a fake? I do not know. But I think I will stick to department store or online skin store.</li>
