    <li> A little large and hang off the sides but I&#x27;m okay with the size. Very pretty!</li>
    <li> I think these are too big to use on fingernails unless you like the big bold look.  I&#x27;m going to incorporate these creating my mosaic tiles.</li>
    <li> the pieces are amazingly beautiful but they are not practical. when I opened the package and saw the bows I thought the earrings I ordered arrived early. to my dismay they were the 3D bows. I will mount them and use them as a pair of earings and three necklaces.</li>
    <li> These bows are much bigger than they appear in the photo. I think they will work for someone eventually but currently they are just inventory among my nail charms.</li>
    <li> I order these for the second time. Waiting for them inpatient cause my costumers love dramatic nails and they love these big bows. They  keep asking about them. I sell these for 5 dollars each when I put on nails and my clients are very happy with the price. They get 2 every time they come thats why I bought 10 orders of these</li>
    <li> These are displayed as nail art.  This bow would take up 3 of my nails - they are huge IN SIZE</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for !</li>
    <li> Way bigger than I&#x27;d expected. NOT A NAIL DECAL. More for cell phone cases and things that need bows. I probably won&#x27;t use them.</li>
    <li> Love them so much ... Came before the estimated delivery , and they are very shiny I&#x27;m very pleased with this product of you love 3d art espically bows I suggest you buy this</li>
    <li> To big for nails but very nice!</li>
    <li> Love them! So pretty :)</li>
    <li> fast shipping and the bows are great! perfect for Nail art</li>
    <li> to large for your finger nail</li>
    <li> These are soooo adorable &amp; HUGE! they overlap my thumb, which says a lot about the size lol it definitely stands out!</li>
    <li> Very pretty and shiny! Easy to apply and durable! Just a bit too big but very very very very pretty!</li>
    <li> The bows are so big it does not even look right on your fingernail</li>
    <li> These bows are much bigger than the picture makes them look! They are huge and are not good for nails. They are way too big, and the picture makes them look small enough for nail design. Not a happy customer!!!!</li>
    <li> Pretty but too big for finger nails.</li>
    <li> The bows are super cute but they are HUGE. The actually bows come out of the nail and I have pretty big nails but other than that they are very sparkly and cute.</li>
    <li> These are awesome so dazzling and fun.  I have bigger fingers so when I placed iron me ring finger it was prefect fit.  I have not used these yet, can&#x27;t wait though.  I will rebut, and have a cartful of others.</li>
