    <li> Great product and great tip:  for best volumn blow dry hair while bent over and when 50-75%&lt;br /&gt;Dry add one pump of product to hands.  Rub into hair especially where volume is needed and continue drying into your preferred style.  You will be pleased and surprised.  No stickiness either.</li>
    <li> This such is great.  After checking numerous grocery stores and Target for weeks, I decided to order online.  Couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied.  It&#x27;s light and holds well.</li>
    <li> This the only stuff that will work on my crazy curly hair!!!</li>
    <li> If you have ANY frizz, this is simply the best.</li>
    <li> Best product by far for curls. I have natural curly hair and have found nothing that comes remotely close to this product. Even the high dollar stuff in salons dose not compare. Unfortunately the stores quit selling it and I have to buy it on amazon. Their loss. Those who say it doesn&#x27;t work are not using it correctly. It does. I have pics to prove it. I am VERY vain when it comes to my hair. I will be the first to tell you this stuff is the bomb. It works. It is awesome..... I can show pics of my hair with this stuff and my hair with other stuff. There is a HUGE difference.</li>
    <li> My hair will always be poofy but it did take the friz got a little sticky but  then smoothed out .</li>
    <li> I tried this on a recommendation from a friend that loves it. I did not notice any difference on my hair. Will not buy again for me.</li>
    <li> I really love this product. Its wonderful on my hair. it works great on damp hair and dry. Takes away the frizzies and curls my curls nicely.  I was very upset when they stop selling it in the stores. I tried several others. Nothing compares to this. I was so happy to find it online.</li>
    <li> I have thin curly frizzy hair and i looove this product. Calms my curls down.. I buy in various quantities so i never run out.</li>
    <li> This stuff works the best with my super curly but fine hair - but I cannot find it in stores in my area.  Very happy to be able to order through amazon!</li>
