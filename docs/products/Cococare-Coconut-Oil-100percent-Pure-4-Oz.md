      <li>coconut oil moisturizes my skin without a greasy feel and leaves it so soft.</li>
      <li>It is extremely greasy when first applied, but, if you give it some time and massage it in, my skin will be almost completely non-oily.</li>

    <li> I love this oil and the price. It doesn&#x27;t have that coconut scent to it, but that&#x27;s perfect as I use it in my hair and hate that I start smelling like a pina colada after using coconut oil in my hair for a few days. I also use it in scrubs and add oils and it&#x27;s worked out great for me. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love it, its great on my skin felt the difference after just one use only thing i don&#x27;t like it doesn&#x27;t have any coconut smell which i was hoping for.</li>
    <li> I purchased these for my son and daughter-in-law after using this brand for a couple years.  I do not experience any issues with chapped lips no matter how long these NE Ohio winters!  I NEVER use Chap Stick and only need to use this a few times a week during the dryest conditions.  Best. Purchase. Ever.</li>
    <li> I used it for making lotion bars where it is nicely moisturizing, but even in Iowa (which is not usually over 76 in the spring) I had to add extra wax to keep the bars in a solid state until used.</li>
    <li> Worked as expected as a scalp oil for dry scalp</li>
    <li> Great for hair growth,  you see proven results within a month of using this.  I will always purchase this product.</li>
    <li> I love the 100% Coconut Oil and will buy again. I am using it on my hands, legs and rub in my hair from time to time.&lt;br /&gt;It does not have any smell so if you are looking for that, don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> Keeps dry skin shiny and has no odor at all! I hate the smell of cocount oil but it works wonders on my skin. So I searched for an odorless bottle of coconut oil and found this one.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet, but this was a convenient way to stock the medicine cabinet for the little one for dry skin.</li>
    <li> Delivered as promised and we love this product. Thank You..</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this product. My skin is so dry and Cococare coconut oil moisturizes my skin without a greasy feel and leaves it so soft.</li>
    <li> It Didn&#x27;t Work for Me  Too Gritty for my Beard and Afro!</li>
    <li> This coconut oil is great. I use it on my skin during my shower, especially for shaving my legs, and it leaves my skin smooth. I&#x27;ve used it for about four months now, reordered a few times, and I&#x27;m very happy with it. It&#x27;s liquid over 76 degrees, so it softens in the shower. As summer sets in, it&#x27;s more liquid than solid all the time. Even as a solid in the wintertime, it softens and melts as soon as it hits the skin making it easy to smooth on.</li>
    <li> Great stuff!!  it&#x27;s making a huge difference in my husband&#x27;s rough hands.</li>

    <li> This stuff is GREAT!!  My hubby loves it. It is far better than the stuff at the big box store.&lt;br /&gt;This was our second order. Super fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I had never used coconut oil before, so I tried this first due to the good reviews.  At first it took time getting used to having the oil solid, warming it up in my hands, and then applying it (I live in San Francisco, so, it is rarely warm enough in the house for it to stay liquid), but, I was able to manage it.  The oil is almost completely scent-free, and seems completely neutral.  It is extremely greasy when first applied, but, if you give it some time and massage it in, my skin will be almost completely non-oily. I tried another type of coconut oil from Whole Foods, but, it smelled horrible and I had to return it.  I am back to purchasing this again!</li>
    <li> Good to throw in your survival kit or B.O.B.  You can use it as fuel, to protect against wind burn/dry skin, or eat it...loads of calories!</li>
    <li> I like the oil but I wish it was in a bigger container so I don&#x27;t have to buy so often.  I use every morning and sundays in the steam room.</li>
    <li> Delivery was prompt, coconut oil works fine and liquefies easily.</li>
    <li> I love the product.  It spreads on nice, is odorless and sinks into the skin quickly to not leave you super greasy.  The only thing I wish, is that it came in a container with a tiny opening.</li>
    <li> Coconut oil changed my life! It arrived very quickly and I immediately put it to use! Its great to use in homemade body scrubs and as shaving cream!! My legs were smooth for days (which never happens for me)! I&#x27;ve also been using it to moisturize my face and my skin is clearing up!</li>
    <li> this stuff is wonderful  under 80 degrees its a solid ....over 80 in turns into a liquid ........great easy to use ....</li>
    <li> Love how soft it makes my skin feel</li>
    <li> I will never EVER buy this again. It has such a strong chemical odor. Not coconut oil. Ew.</li>
    <li> arrived quickly and was exactly as described.</li>
    <li> Great product. Excellent delivery time</li>
