<li> If I decide to use a flat iron, I use 1/2 a pump of the aragon oil, just to make it shine.  </li>
<li> I have long, thick, course, straight, asian hair and the Herstyler aragon oil products allow me to wash and go.  </li>
<li> goes a long way.</li>
<li> i like a thick lather that i can get all the way down to the scalp and you need more than a small size like the size of a quarter.</li>
<li> very hydrating, if you have long or thick hair i would advise getting a bigger size, it only lasted me a little while.</li>
<li> Purchased this for my over processed and dry hair.</li>
<li> I HAVE REALLY DRY HAIR</li>
<li> and I blow dry</li>
<li> But for average to course hair I totally recommend it.</li>
<li> This product calms them down actually has my hair looking twenty years smoother.</li>
<li> Mine only came with conditioner, no shampoo so I was let down on that.</li>
<li> but these are not scent at all and one of the shampoo arrive only with half of product because the bottom of the bottle was cut</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I received my hair products one of my hair conditioners and one shampoo was busted open! Not happy at all!</li>
    <li> very hydrating, if you have long or thick hair i would advise getting a bigger size, it only lasted me a little while. the saying a little goes a long way never works for hair care products for me. i like a thick lather that i can get all the way down to the scalp and you need more than a small size like the size of a quarter. the conditioner went faster, but if you use a leave in or something you could probably make that one last longer.</li>
    <li> Shipped fast, I love this product!</li>
    <li> wife loves this product</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I expected...</li>
    <li> I love this product. Me and my whole family!</li>
    <li> good shampoo &amp; conditioner</li>
    <li> It did work nice on me</li>
    <li> Love love love left my hair super soft for my iron. Almost like salon hair</li>
    <li> I am giving this as a gift. I am sure it will be great</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner!!!! It has the right amount of oils and leaves my hair extremely healthy.It is the BEST shampoo and conditioner I have ever used for my hair and I don&#x27;t plan on using anything else. Works really well with the Heat protective straightening cream. The hair styling spray however, has too much water in it for my hair and made it start to curl again right after flat ironing. But over all an awesome line of products that worked miracles with my frizzy extremely curly bi-racial hair. It worked better then relaxers or keratin treatments on my hair, which is awesome since I am trying to avoid chemicals at all costs.

    <li> Love it, wish it didn&#x27;t come in such a small package</li>
    <li> This is not the same product that can be purchased straight from herstyler. It&#x27;s gross and smells like cheap coconut shampoo. Will not be purchasing from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Love and shall purchase again.</li>
    <li> I really Love the conditioner and the shampoo it makes my hair very silky and looking healthy.....the delivery of the product was very fast!</li>
    <li> This is honestly the best shampoo &amp; conditioner I&#x27;ve tried - &amp; I&#x27;ve tried everything. Of all the salon &amp; drugstore brands nothing compares. I have thick, wavy hair that gets out of control easily. When I use Herstyler products it looks 100% better. Leaves my hair silky &amp; smooth with no flyaways. It smells great too, like fresh, clean roses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may not be right for you if you have very fine or oily hair, it has serious moisture content. But for average to course hair I totally recommend it. Getting ready to order another set of 4 right now.</li>
    <li> I received a shampoo and conditioner from my daughter who purchased it from a temporary booth in the mall, I have thick course hair and I blow dry it smooth My hair is colored and dry , this product makes my hair shinny and soft as silk without being fly away, I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> seemed to make my hair thicker than usual. I will still occasionally use this product though and will recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried the real stuff. It has a very earthy smell and I loved it. Bought from this seller and smelled like coconut suave shampoo. Yuck.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product. Waste of money for small amount &amp; I expected a better result.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair soft and silky. It smells great! Before drying my hair I use the Herstyler Serum w/Argan Oil. Then again before I straighten my hair. This keeps my naturally poofy hair controlled but with some volume.</li>
    <li> easy to use. Leaves my hair smooth, soft and smelling amazing</li>
    <li> Thought I got a deal at the mall only to see if I can find it on Amazon...I did find it on Amazon and instead of paying $49 for one pair of shampoo/conditioner, I only paid less than $15!!!! I LOVE this product. It makes my hair feel soft. My hair is usually somewhat course.</li>
    <li> I have thick wavy hair and this is my absolute favorite to use for taming frizz plus it smells great! Because it&#x27;s so hard to find I love that not only can I get it here but to get it as a bundle is wonderful!!</li>
    <li> Delivery of this item was awesome and love this product. It makes hair healthier, shinier, and more manageable. I highlight my hair blonde and am a hair product junky :) this is great!</li>
    <li> only this brand has been able to keep my hair nice soft fluffy and healthier than ever.thank you very much</li>
    <li> This is not the same shampoo and conditioner that is sold by herstyler. This was a cheap knock off, and my purchase has been returned. I will not purchase from this seller again, as it seems that the products inside of the bottle are not what are labeled on the outside.  The consistency, texture and fragrance are completely different than the real herstyler product line.</li>
    <li> Wonderful products!!!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is cheap and the conditioner doesn&#x27;t even work as a conditioner.</li>
    <li> this makes my hair feel so nourished and smells so good.it really helps my unruly hair more manageable.great for color treated hair.</li>
    <li> I want the right item i order in the ounce i order it in..</li>
    <li> I love using this product my hair it always leaves it soft and lush. I will definitely buy again from amazon for the savings.</li>
    <li> Mine only came with conditioner, no shampoo so I was let down on that. I like the product but expected conditioner and shampoo.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my over processed and dry hair. The price and shipping was fair, but the product did nothing for my hair. I had to use twice as much product as my regular shampoo and conditioner. Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> This product leaves my hair shiny and soft...the best shampoo and conditioner I have ever used. Only a small amount of both is needed.</li>
    <li> Mix it with my regular shampoo and conditioner and it works great on my natural curly hair!  Look Ma, no frizz!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best hair care product I have ever used. I am at that age where the kinky grays start to form. This product calms them down actually has my hair looking twenty years smoother. I have a warning. I have purchased this product at fairs and malls for much more than Amazon sells it for. Only buy it on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Its a fine shampoo and conditioner does just what it says but often i felt that it left my dry scalp and hair greasy feeling and heavy. It does leave a nice shine do don&#x27;t be heavy handed when using this a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I love the hairstyler nursing and moisturizing shampoo and conditioner with argon oil set four.  It&#x27;s perfect for color treated hair It leaves my hair feeling soft, looking shiny &amp; it smells fabulous</li>
    <li> Absolutely love the way this shampoo and conditoner leave my hair silky soft. I first tried this product by purchasing at a kiosk at the local mall.  Since then I&#x27;ve been hooked.</li>
    <li> Love the way my hair feels after shampoo.</li>
    <li> I HAVE BEEN USING HERSTYLER SHAMPOO AND CONDITIONER SINCE LAST YEAR I HAVE REALLY DRY HAIR THE CONDITIONER HAS HELPED MY HAIR TREMENDOUSLY I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE WITH VERY DRY HAIR</li>
    <li> Lightning fast, well packaged and for once-no leaks!! This has happened when buying shampoo from other sellers! I will be back!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Have been purchasing it for a few years</li>
    <li> Very nice. Keeps your hair soft and full</li>
    <li> Makes me feel like I walk out of a salon every morning. LOVE this stuff!!</li>
    <li> I ONLY use Herstyler hair products.  I have gotten my mother-in-law an sister hooked on the aragon oil products.  The shampoo and conditioner leave my hair shiny and soft so I don&#x27;t need to put any other products on afterwards.  I have long, thick, course, straight, asian hair and the Herstyler aragon oil products allow me to wash and go.  I use the Herstyler aragon oil hair mask once a week as a deep conditioner.  If I decide to use a flat iron, I use 1/2 a pump of the aragon oil, just to make it shine.  Great product!</li>
    <li> The product is great, but I ordered two shampoos and two conditions and the package came with four conditioners and no shampoo. I still really like the product and it&#x27;s not worth dealing with returning it but it&#x27;s also not what I ordered, hence the lower rating.</li>
    <li> Not close to the real product</li>
    <li> Very disappointed with this product, the reason that I bought it is because the scent is great but these are not scent at all and one of the shampoo arrive only with half of product because the bottom of the bottle was cut</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t help much. Not that good.</li>
    <li> Fake! It smells different and doesn&#x27;t makes my hair feel the same way that the real one does. it works like a regular shampoo and conditioner, but it was cheap though..</li>
    <li> The product was great, I loved it and will buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
