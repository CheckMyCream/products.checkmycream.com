    <li> MEOW! Feeling a little feisty or going to dress up as Ariana Grande for Halloween? This would be so perfect! It is slightly uncomfortable on my head since it is all metal. It is great quality for the price! Make sure you look at how long it will take to get to you though!</li>

    <li> They look exactly like the picture and I loved them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only problems are that one part of the ear broke off of the headband part on the first wear. And when I tried taking them off, the ends scratched me and gave me a mark on my face. So for anyone who buys this, be careful because the ends of the headband are pretty sharp.</li>
    <li> Daughter loved it. It even came with glue for repairs. She&#x27;s worn it almost 10 times, and haven&#x27;t needed the glue yet. Metal headband can be uncomfortable when worn with glasses.</li>
    <li> So cute! I wear these out everywhere now</li>
    <li> They came broken, the ear wire separated from the band</li>
