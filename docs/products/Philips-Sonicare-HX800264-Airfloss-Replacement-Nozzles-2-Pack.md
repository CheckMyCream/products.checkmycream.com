      <li>Arrived in great shape.  </li>
      <li>I am happy with my purchase.</li>
      <li>Although flossing is great for gum health.</li>
      <li>The Philips Sonicare Airfloss System works great on folks with braces.</li>
      <li>These tips fit perfectly and they work great.  </li>
      <li>Good thought to have something mechanical to floss teeth</li>
      <li>Good to have a backup in case a nozzle breaks.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>They can good and sturdy.</li>
      <li>I bought this with some trepediation, but the reviews were good</li>
      <li>Being a user of Sonic Care toothbrush, I wanted to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The air-floss works great, it is easy to use, 5-6 press of button and it builds up pressure for air-flossing.</li>
      <li>The replacement heads are nice to keep on hand.</li>
      <li>I love my sonicate air flosser and it was nice to have the replacement nozzles.  </li>
      <li>One must already own a Philips Airfloss flosser to be able to use these tips.</li>
      <li>Good product as a supplement to the device, although haven&#x27;t had a chance to use these yet, since the original is working fine/</li>
      <li>Great product, I switched from a competitor and this is far superior to Water Pik products.</li>
      <li>This is wonderful as you can put listerine in it and it not only flosses, but kills bacteria.</li>
      <li>more so floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>That is, you&#x27;d be better off with toothpicks and</li>
      <li>My gums deserve for me to be sure I always have the heads on hand.</li>
      <li>After using it I can say that All who said it works better that manual floss were just trying to sell this product.  </li>
      <li>I have used the Air Flosser for about 4 months and love the way it gets the debris from in between the teeth better than just brushing and flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Debris gets blown out between my teeth for the most part and when there&#x27;s something stringly that the Airfloss can&#x27;t get out, I just use</li>
      <li>and she stated that she was glad that I introduced this item to her as she loves the way it keeps her teeth squeaky</li>
      <li>Anyone with permanent bridges or crowns would love the air flosser</li>
      <li>I am pleased with it all.</li>
      <li>Could someone design a better product?</li>
      <li>My teeth are whiter and the stains were mostly gone within 10 days.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s quick, easy and effective.</li>
      <li>and it is very quick.  </li>
      <li>Easy to change out and work with.</li>
      <li>The flosser itself does fine - got it at recommendation of dentist.</li>
      <li>But the replacement nozzles are just fine.  </li>
      <li>I have not used the replacement nozzles yet but expect they&#x27;ll be as fine as the one on the Sonicare.</li>
      <li>and I can floss much more quickly than if I did it with floss.</li>
      <li>I love the product - It is fun and easy to use.</li>
      <li>Amazon does a great job with add-on purchases though so replacement is easy and relatively inexpensive.</li>
      <li>Frustration free packaging is the way to go for the discount.</li>
      <li>Replacements fit correctly</li>
      <li>but I suspect that is to ensure no water leaks through the friction fit.</li>
      <li>Made cheaply.</li>
      <li>The price is certainly worth being able to floss without interruption.</li>
      <li>Love my new sonicare air floss &amp; glad I can get replacements online in a timely manner.</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t like the original.</li>
      <li>They do what they are supposed to do and are for replacement if the original nozzle goes kaput.</li>
      <li>love it so much that I recommended it to my sister</li>
      <li>These fit and work perfectly as a replacement for the original broken while in suit case on an airline trip</li>
      <li>Easy to use, quick, and way more effective than flossing in half the time.  </li>
      <li>pretty effective, better than traditional floss.</li>
      <li>The only issue I have is that they do not do a great job of cleaning out those places where my teeth are very close together or overlapping.  </li>
      <li>These were the same configuration as the original ones, and I can say that they are very easy to interchange.  </li>
      <li>I use the Sonicare Airfloss daily, sometime s more often.  </li>
      <li>I have more to say on the next review of the brush heads....</li>
      <li>I would recommend it to anyone who is interested.</li>
      <li>You will note a review I did later about the Conic Care Air Flosser that love.</li>
      <li>I plan to buy more once our current ones wear out (which they show no sign of doing).</li>
      <li>I have some crooked teeth and those do not easily allow the water to pass through, but most teeth are normally spaced and the burst of air and water do a good job.</li>
      <li>But that is minor compared to being able to feel the difference.</li>
      <li>it is easy and no mess to clean up from flossing with regular floss.</li>
      <li>Although I think you will only need one for a very long time, it is good to have some backups.  </li>
      <li>It is so much easier to floss</li>
      <li>I bought this one for my grandson since he just had his braces taken off and doesn&#x27;t like to floss much.  </li>
      <li>There really isn&#x27;t a lot that one can say about the tips themselves, except for the fact that they work.</li>
      <li>It looked very bulky.</li>
      <li>Product is ok but not wonderful, these replacement heads however are fine to replace the original one.</li>
      <li>but the original should last for awhile.  </li>
      <li>I am still using the first one after the first year, with an occasional cleaning.  </li>
      <li>would highly recommend this product to anyone, who would like to floss, but does not like the threading process.</li>
      <li>and I highly recommend this item to anyone that is concerned with their dental health.</li>
      <li>In fact, it seemed useless and I was happy to return it.</li>
      <li>I was a shame I had to have other items in my order to get this item free shipping.  </li>
      <li>is a new product; I am still evaluating the effectiveness of the product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Or use this first to get some gunk out, and then do a final cleanup with some floss</li>
      <li>So far the Sonicare Air Flosser works like a charm.  </li>
      <li>I have gone back to using my Water Pik which works very well.</li>
      <li>I really needed this item, my husband, daughter &amp; I all use one air floss and obviously do not want to share the same Nozzle.  </li>
      <li>At the very least, if there&#x27;s more than one user of the Airfloss, then there should be one tip for each used.</li>
      <li>once in a while, since bacteria possibly my build up near the opening.</li>
      <li>It barely contains enough liquid to get through two flossings.</li>
      <li>but it is certainly easier and takes less time</li>
      <li>It really cut down on my tartar.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product is a waste of money. If you have teeth that are tight together, forget it! I&#x27;m back to using floss!</li>
    <li> We decided to get some extra nozzles for our sonicare airfloss, so that we only needed to have one airfloss to share between myself and my husband.  These were the same configuration as the original ones, and I can say that they are very easy to interchange.  At this point we have been swapping nightly for several months, no issues with the airfloss working properly.  The only little trick is to turn it off before you remove them (so you don&#x27;t accidently spray water all over).  I plan to buy more once our current ones wear out (which they show no sign of doing).</li>
    <li> The Airflosser is awesome!  It really cut down on my tartar.  I use Listerine mouthwash instead of water or air.  Works great!</li>
    <li> Although I think you will only need one for a very long time, it is good to have some backups.  I am still using the first one after the first year, with an occasional cleaning.  Frustration free packaging is the way to go for the discount.</li>
    <li> So far the Sonicare Air Flosser works like a charm.  I have used the Air Flosser for about 4 months and love the way it gets the debris from in between the teeth better than just brushing and flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it so much that I recommended it to my sister and she stated that she was glad that I introduced this item to her as she loves the way it keeps her teeth squeaky clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 5 stars and I highly recommend this item to anyone that is concerned with their dental health.</li>
    <li> Love my new sonicare air floss &amp; glad I can get replacements online in a timely manner. Replacements fit correctly</li>
    <li> These replacement nozzles work great - Airfloss is must have produce.  I would recommend this product to anyone who hates to floss their teeth.</li>
    <li> Good thought to have something mechanical to floss teeth but it is a useless product. Water shoots everywere. Container to hold the water is hard to fill and is so small you need to fill it twice just for one flossing. Stay away. Could someone design a better product?</li>
    <li> I love the product - It is fun and easy to use. But it should have come in the box especially at Christmas. I purchased one before and it came with the box.</li>
    <li> Great product, I switched from a competitor and this is far superior to Water Pik products. Easy to change out and work with.</li>
    <li> These things work and work well.  I got the Sonicare a while back on a whim and have been amazed at how well it works.  Easy to use, quick, and way more effective than flossing in half the time.  Other than periodic changing of the tips this machine requires no maintenance.  The only downside is that since they are such a limited market only Philips makes the tips.  Amazon does a great job with add-on purchases though so replacement is easy and relatively inexpensive.</li>
    <li> pretty effective, better than traditional floss. Im using it every day now. Will buy another one for my wife soon.</li>
    <li> I love my sonicate air flosser and it was nice to have the replacement nozzles.  Anyone with permanent bridges or crowns would love the air flosser it is easy and no mess to clean up from flossing with regular floss.</li>
    <li> Product is ok but not wonderful, these replacement heads however are fine to replace the original one.</li>
    <li> You will note a review I did later about the Conic Care Air Flosser that love. I thought this would be the prefect match for the Air Flosser but it was not even close.</li>
    <li> These are spare items for use with the Sonicare Airfloss electric flosser. They do what they are supposed to do and are for replacement if the original nozzle goes kaput.</li>
    <li> I use the Sonicare Airfloss daily, sometime s more often.  These tips fit perfectly and they work great.  The only issue I have is that they do not do a great job of cleaning out those places where my teeth are very close together or overlapping.  But even dental floss or tape has a tough time with these as well.</li>
    <li> Although flossing is great for gum health. I did not enjoy flossing using the floss thread. My dentist recommended waterpik. It looked very bulky. Then I came across air-floss from Sonicare. Being a user of Sonic Care toothbrush, I wanted to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The air-floss works great, it is easy to use, 5-6 press of button and it builds up pressure for air-flossing. The time taken to floss is about 1 minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Total time for brushing and flossing 3 minutes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I floss regularly and my dental hygienist is happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product to anyone, who would like to floss, but does not like the threading process.</li>
    <li> Not sure if this really gets between the teeth as well as regaular flossing but it is certainly easier and takes less time</li>
    <li> I have always hated flossing my teeth so on the advice of my dentist I ordered on of these.  It is so much easier to floss and it is very quick.  I would recommend it to anyone who is interested.</li>
    <li> Frustrated by years of Waterpic sloppiness, I ordered the Airfloss. I was totally disappointed. Puffing three shots of wet air was unsatisfactory to do the job. In fact, it seemed useless and I was happy to return it.</li>
    <li> Learned the hardway after dropping my flosser in the shower.  It&#x27;s good to keep extras! lol  The price is certainly worth being able to floss without interruption.</li>
    <li> One must already own a Philips Airfloss flosser to be able to use these tips. There really isn&#x27;t a lot that one can say about the tips themselves, except for the fact that they work. Although Philips has nothing to say about whether one should replace the tips after a period of usage, it may be advisable to do so once in a while, since bacteria possibly my build up near the opening. At the very least, if there&#x27;s more than one user of the Airfloss, then there should be one tip for each used.</li>
    <li> Arrived in great shape.  I am one who would rather have extra heads just in case.  You just never know.  My gums deserve for me to be sure I always have the heads on hand.</li>
    <li> air floss broke after two month&#x27;s super weak sauce for a $100 product</li>
    <li> These fit and work perfectly as a replacement for the original broken while in suit case on an airline trip</li>
    <li> That is, you&#x27;d be better off with toothpicks and more so floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This leaves a lot of material behind. Too gimmicky and not efficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or use this first to get some gunk out, and then do a final cleanup with some floss</li>
    <li> Good to have a backup in case a nozzle breaks.&lt;br /&gt;This is a new product; I am still evaluating the effectiveness of the product.</li>
    <li> It does not have enough power to remove food particles from between the teeth.  I have gone back to using my Water Pik which works very well.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t like the original. Made cheaply. I have more to say on the next review of the brush heads....the end!</li>
    <li> Not sure about the effectiveness of the airfloss system just yet.  But the replacement nozzles are just fine.  As expected.</li>
    <li> Everything went well with my transaction, overall order and purchase. I am pleased with it all. Thank You !</li>
    <li> PERFECT! GReat value!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using sonicare tootbrush since 2004 and this product blew me away. I hated flossing with a passion but since the air floss came, I dont mind flossing pretty much everyday.</li>
    <li> I try to order replacement tops where I can but the original should last for awhile.  They can good and sturdy.</li>
    <li> saved time;easy to order;aved gas+++never seen in  retail store; I broke the one which came with the unit and as I stated previously, I have never seen them in stores</li>
    <li> Reading the comments before buying this product, I was a bit wary but after using it I have nothing but praise.  I flossed the usual way after using the Airfloss and was pleasantly surprised at how well it did.  I would recommend it to anyone, especially to those who are not in the flossing habit.  It&#x27;s quick, easy and effective.</li>
    <li> Strings and fingers in my mouth, getting the floss stuck on my teeth...I hate flossing. I bought this with some trepediation, but the reviews were good and I have a Sonicare electric toothbrush I like. I use it all the time and I can floss much more quickly than if I did it with floss. Debris gets blown out between my teeth for the most part and when there&#x27;s something stringly that the Airfloss can&#x27;t get out, I just use regular floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One charge lasts a long time, so I can take the Airfloss with me on trips and not have to ever recharge it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use mouthwash instead of water in the reservoir. The reservoir could be a little bigger. It barely contains enough liquid to get through two flossings. But that is minor compared to being able to feel the difference. My gums are healthier because I use the Airfloss daily.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ll eventually need replacement nozzles.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon is lowest price I found, and ordered them when I ordered the basis unit itself.&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t need them for quite a while, but when you do, they&#x27;re there and don&#x27;t have to suffer sticker shock in the local drugstore or Walmart.</li>
    <li> Good product as a supplement to the device, although haven&#x27;t had a chance to use these yet, since the original is working fine/</li>
    <li> I have not used the replacement nozzles yet but expect they&#x27;ll be as fine as the one on the Sonicare.</li>
    <li> I really needed this item, my husband, daughter &amp; I all use one air floss and obviously do not want to share the same Nozzle.  I was a shame I had to have other items in my order to get this item free shipping.  C&#x27;mon, basic hygiene peeps.  Send them in a padded envelope instead of a giant box.</li>
    <li> The Philips Sonicare Airfloss System works great on folks with braces. The replacement heads are nice to keep on hand. I am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I still use floss once a day but this helps take the stains away from coffee and tea.  My teeth are whiter and the stains were mostly gone within 10 days.  I would buy it again.  I don&#x27;t like to use bleach on my teeth and this does nearly as well with a lot less sensitivity.  Although I use tooth sensative toothpaste but I brush after I use the Sonic Care flosser.  Great dental hygene instrument.  Way to go Sonic Care.</li>
    <li> not like there is a choice - these were only replacements I found at the time. I actually bought them at the same time so my wife could have one and we&#x27;d have a spare - so far no need for spares, they should last a long time since they see little wear. they are bit snug to pull out to swap but I suspect that is to ensure no water leaks through the friction fit. The flosser itself does fine - got it at recommendation of dentist. I have some crooked teeth and those do not easily allow the water to pass through, but most teeth are normally spaced and the burst of air and water do a good job. I like to use some mouthwash in it and biggest complaint is difficulty to fill it without spilling.</li>
    <li> I went for it after my dentist suggested. After using it I can say that All who said it works better that manual floss were just trying to sell this product.  Now that i have it , I do use it but because of this product I could not give up manual flossing.</li>
    <li> My husband has one and has gotten very good dental visits since using it.  I bought this one for my grandson since he just had his braces taken off and doesn&#x27;t like to floss much.  This is wonderful as you can put listerine in it and it not only flosses, but kills bacteria.</li>
