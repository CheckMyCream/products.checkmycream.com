      <li>it gives you a delicious Tan!</li>
      <li>I loved!</li>
      <li>All the sunscreens/oils don&#x27;t stay oily and they work great, even after swimming.</li>
      <li>I am sooo happy Amazon continues to carry this tanning spray.  </li>
      <li>Carrot root extract is another ingredient which is a great antioxidant for skin protection - and</li>
      <li>This one is particularly great.</li>
      <li>the bronze color it gives you is amazing!</li>
      <li>This is a good product.</li>
      <li>And It smells good to.</li>
      <li>And the light formula and great scent doesn&#x27;t hurt!</li>
      <li>smells good.</li>
      <li>Does a good job of bronzing me, and smells good too.</li>
      <li>Awesome product and works great if as me you don&#x27;t wanna spend the whole day sunbathing</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>Would not use on fair skin you would burn for -sure, but my skin type works wonders..</li>
      <li>Great for a quick tan when you want one.</li>
      <li>Worth a try if you&#x27;re looking for a reliable LIGHT outdoor tanning product that smells great!</li>
      <li>I love this product, it smells good and the oil texture is light.</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>This product gave me a nice color skin, and protected me from the sun light...</li>
      <li>, Angel I&#x27;ve found I like the best, second is ever after tan extender, it lasts 24 hours, kisses tan darkner</li>
      <li>but once it dries its ok.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>Rather have lotion it tans better</li>
      <li>Love this tanning oil.</li>
      <li>Like all Australian gold products, this one is superb.  </li>
      <li>I tan easily with or without lotions.  </li>
      <li>so it is easy to apply .</li>
      <li>No greasy feeling and easy to apply.</li>
      <li>works  just as good as the high price lotions plus this is a spray</li>
      <li>Vitamin E is obviously fabulous for skin.</li>
      <li>The more sweat the better, this also didn&#x27;t really provide that milky smooth skin you get from bronzers combined with after tan darkening, firming, wrinkle remover lotion</li>
      <li>ive use this stuff for over 2 years now, love the smell, doesn&#x27;t stain clothing, is absorbed into skin, no gooey oily residue, got a tan line in 2 days.</li>
      <li>but for most people this stuff would be great, for like a quick tan in a stand up bed, a shirtless walk or jog, it really isn&#x27;t oily, the reason I only gave four stars, instead of five, is because it doesn&#x27;t seem to spread very far, lotions cover a good amount of area, to cover myself evenly with this, by the time I was done bronzeing up</li>
      <li>I purchased this for the first time during a vacation out of state and fell in love with the formula.</li>
      <li>the dry oil smells great and significantly helps me tan.</li>
      <li>this is for outdoor tanning, it is ok, leaves a very oily feel on your skin.</li>
      <li>If you need to exchange old skin layers for new, this is a great product.</li>
      <li>I absolutely can NOT find this product locally, so when I ran out of my first bottle I was so happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Worth the price no doubt.</li>
      <li>The golden brown color and the smoothness of my skin</li>
      <li>It may feel a bit sticky going on, but the results are so worth it.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t make it so you feel oily and definitely gives you a nice bronze color.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is the classic tropical Australian Gold scent that smells just as good hours after applying and is non-offensive.</li>
      <li>It has no greasy feeling, is very easy to apply, you can go out into public right after tanning</li>
      <li>This is my absolute favorite outdoor tanning product so far!</li>
      <li>With all that being said, I may not buy this again, but it does actually work and cleans up easy!-)</li>
      <li>This gives good color and is good for short day tans but definitely not for those long, hot days. . . .</li>
      <li>, 3 or less is perfect, an occasional level one bed is even better, level 4 or 5 beds aren&#x27;t for me, as they do nothing, don&#x27;t really even darken me more, plus while I tan I turn off every single fan and turn up every single lamp, I love the sauna feeling, this also doesn&#x27;t cake on</li>
      <li>This oil goes on easily, no streaking, no oily feeling, results were great, much darker in one day at the beach.</li>
      <li>, it makes your skin turn more red, but you have to put it on before and after bed and after showers.</li>
      <li>The product really delivers what it promises!</li>
      <li>I really recommend!</li>
      <li>Neutrogena used to make one that was wonderful, unfortunately they don&#x27;t anymore.</li>
      <li>so-that&#x27;s ok if I use a different lotion tomorrow and don&#x27;t skip a tan,</li>
      <li>Love Australian Gold products.</li>
      <li>I actually like the most</li>
      <li>, I don&#x27;t even know how many pumps I used, though it did the job very well, I have different skin, so</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product more than anything else out there for deep, dark tanning...</li>
      <li>The shipping from the supplier was fast.  </li>
      <li>thanks Juan</li>
      <li>This is just orange watery liquid that streams out in one place and is very sticky.</li>
      <li>Tyrosine, is responsible for this claim.</li>
      <li>Tyrosine is an amino acid that melanin (responsible for the pigment of your skin) is made from.</li>
      <li>Use sparingly as it REALLY intensifies the sun during exposure.  </li>
      <li>Using this product after only a couple times in a tanning bed, I get a smooth, even, full body color that is sexy to say the least.  </li>
      <li>There are instant natural bronzers in this product thanks to the black walnut shell extract which provides a great glow after applying.</li>
      <li>brings a smile to the opposite sex.</li>
      <li>Honestly I was just curious to try this and wanted a cheaper lotion to switch out with other ones, or use different ones in different level beds, I&#x27;m Indian and Italian, so I have olive skin, which to get a decent, good looking tan I need red in my color, which is what I was hoping this would provide, well it definitely made me more bronze than red,</li>
      <li>If you have had enough soon and is ready for boosting it up, you should use this one!</li>
      <li>I live near the ocean.</li>
      <li>I enjoy tanning year round.  </li>
      <li>Also, their products have a fragarance that is soft.</li>
      <li>The formula also states melanin as an ingredient so the idea is to boost your skins natural ability to produce melanin, which is then darkened by your skin&#x27;s reaction to UV Rays, thus speeding up your tan.</li>
      <li>I believe it does boost my skin&#x27;s natural ability to pick up color from the sun.</li>
      <li>Obviously this isn&#x27;t a miracle product - but what it is is an affordable, reasonable outdoor tanning product that had some thought put into its formula for your skin&#x27;s benefit.</li>
      <li>I pair it with either the Australian gold SPF 8 or 15, depending on how much sun I plan on getting that day.</li>
      <li>Australian Gold products in various SPF with bronzer are all worth the price for the ease of uniform application.</li>
      <li>This is not a dry oil in my opinion.</li>
      <li>It is a dry oil, so your skin is left smooth and silky - not sticky or slick.</li>
      <li>I have different needs, I like to stick with black bronzers or higher, with a middle level or lower tanning bed</li>

    <li> The shipping from the supplier was fast.  Too bad I don&#x27;t care for the product, it goes on sticky and stays that way.  I&#x27;ve used other dry oil products before and they weren&#x27;t like that.  Neutrogena used to make one that was wonderful, unfortunately they don&#x27;t anymore.</li>

    <li> This gives good color and is good for short day tans but definitely not for those long, hot days. . . .</li>
    <li> It prob. works but it burned me so bad I had blisters all over my skin.  I used this with Australian Gold Dark Tanning Oil Intensifier.  OOH THE PAIN!!!</li>
    <li> this is for outdoor tanning, it is ok, leaves a very oily feel on your skin. you will definitely need to take a shower when you are done tanning.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I am sooo happy Amazon continues to carry this tanning spray.  It gives an extra pop of bronze color when tanning.  I use it for tanning both outside and at the salon.  It may feel a bit sticky going on, but the results are so worth it.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Australian Gold!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been using this product for a week now in a tanning bed . works  just as good as the high price lotions plus this is a spray so it is easy to apply . smells good.</li>
    <li> used before like the product</li>
    <li> Love Australian Gold products. This one is particularly great. I have the best tan, and I don&#x27;t peel.</li>
    <li> Like all Australian gold products, this one is superb.  I tan easily with or without lotions.  This oil goes on easily, no streaking, no oily feeling, results were great, much darker in one day at the beach.</li>
    <li> I live near the ocean. I go tanning every year. I do not burn easily or excessively. I already had base tan when I used this product. I burned head to toe- I never experienced anything like it. Every inch of my skin was red for several days, and then everything pilled. Forgive me for the details, but I had skin laying on the floor all around the chair where I sit. If you need to exchange old skin layers for new, this is a great product. Everything came off up to 2-3 layers. It was pilling, then next layer would pill, then next layer and it did not stop pilling for weeks. I do not see it saying anywhere that it is &amp;#34;Tingling&amp;#34; product. There is no warning about increasing burn potential. If I had time to sue the manufacturer, I would, because the damage was extensive.</li>
    <li> The product really delivers what it promises! I loved! I used it once and now I got a beautiful tan!</li>
    <li> I really recommend! This product gave me a nice color skin, and protected me from the sun light... thanks Juan</li>
    <li> Like this oil. Does a good job of bronzing me, and smells good too. Great for a quick tan when you want one.</li>
    <li> This product is recommend if you are tanned already. If you have had enough soon and is ready for boosting it up, you should use this one!</li>
    <li> I enjoy tanning year round.  Using this product after only a couple times in a tanning bed, I get a smooth, even, full body color that is sexy to say the least.  It has no greasy feeling, is very easy to apply, you can go out into public right after tanning and you&#x27;ll see the eyes watching you when you walk by.  The golden brown color and the smoothness of my skin I get using this dry oil brings a smile to the opposite sex.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product more than anything else out there for deep, dark tanning...it gives you a delicious Tan!</li>
    <li> This is a dry tanning oil. So you will not receive any moisture to your skin from it but the bronze color it gives you is amazing!</li>
    <li> Was sticky and smelled! Gave me a very dirty appearance after 1 tan which washed off! Gross!</li>
    <li> This is a good product. It was delivered before expected And It smells good to. It is a little sticky after applying but once it dries its ok. Worth the price no doubt.</li>
    <li> Awsome product! As expected</li>
    <li> Great product for tanning!</li>
