<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have rosacea, so I have to be very careful about what I use on my face.  I put a little of my face cleaner on the sponge and, very lightly and gently swirled the sponge across my entire face and neck.  After rinsing, my skin was smooth and soft.  The next day I did not know what to expect, whether I would be broke out or not.  Turns out, I still had smooth, soft skin.  No redness.  It&#x27;s hard to explain, it&#x27;s like a smooth glaze is on your face.  The texture of my skin was the same all over, smooth and even.  Very nice.</li>
    <li> Really great for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> The Konjac sponge for mature skin is wonderful. I have been using it for a short time, but it leaves my skin glowing and fresh looking. I will certainly but it again. Good product.</li>
    <li> I got this for my mama and she really enjoyed it!&lt;br /&gt;She stated after using it, her face felt softer.&lt;br /&gt;The konjac sponge is a super gentle exfoliator. It can feel slimy and weird if you haven&#x27;t used something like it before, but just stick with the texture.&lt;br /&gt;I wash my face with oil, so I clean my face with oil and washcloth before using the sponge (so does my mama). I don&#x27;t use any harsh cleansers, and only use my konjac with water. It does a great job exfoliating, and I can tell the difference in my skin&#x27;s softness when I use it.&lt;br /&gt;As far as the turmeric in the sponge, I think its effectiveness is due to the exfoliating properties and not the infused properties of the turmeric. But the color is fun and if it works for you, it works!</li>
    <li> This is a very gentle, yet effective, way to exfoliate and cleanse your face.  I feel it also stimulates circulation. I soap my face with a quality sulfur soap and then use the sponge for a few minutes...allowing the benefits of the soap on the skin.  I enjoy using it---have had it for 3 months now.  Waited to review it after I had used it for awhile.  I will definitely get another one, and consider the charcoal one as well (with my bamboo charcoal soap).</li>
    <li> The Konjac sponges are great for exfoliating. They are gentle on your skin, but do a great job ! Leaves your skin glowing !</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know if it helps my &amp;#34;mature skin&amp;#34; but it is good for gentle exfoliation. I use it after a light peel or if my skin is irritated from retinol - times when using a strong physical exfoliate is not prudent. You absolutely still need cleanser to remove make-up or sunscreen. The sponge without product doesn&#x27;t make a dent in mascara under eyes, but I do like that the shape of the sponge lets me wipe under my eyes without having to shut them.</li>
    <li> I love it. It cleans my face very well. I would recommend it</li>
    <li> This sponge is great! I noticed after using it my skin looked brighter, cleaner, and softer. Lately I have been having trouble with breakouts(I think due to the water in my new apartment) and this helped calm down red spots making acne significantly less noticeable. I have problems with my face feeling either tight, plastic-like, and just flat out uncomfortable after using any type of cleanser. My skin actually feels normal after using this. I will be having family members using this for sure!    ***Update  I just had to add more to this review, I think this sponge is so so so awesome. My make up goes on so beautifully after using this and it even seemed to have lightened my skin! I recommend using it not only on your face but on your neck and chest area as well.    This seems to be a pretty good regimen with this sponge:  1. Cleansing oil  2. Turmeric Sponge  3. Spray with rose/lavender water  4. Moisturize with jojoba oil.</li>
    <li> This works remarkably well.  The dark spot on my cheek is almost gone.  A miracle.  Think in just a little while longer using this sponge, the dark spot will be completely gone.  Makes your face feel clean and so easy to use</li>
    <li> no noticeable changes</li>
    <li> it left my skin feeling clean, most likely keep using it</li>
    <li> Best konjac sponge I&#x27;ve tried yet (and I&#x27;ve tried MANY brands). Shape and included suction cup allow it to hang dry completely to prevent mildew. I just reordered, and my first sponge lasted four months. A very good value, especially considering it has absolutely cleared my acne-prone skin. Will continue to order from Leonie.</li>
    <li> These are the best!! I&#x27;ve ordered the other brand &amp;#34;My Konjac&amp;#34; which was a great product, but the Leonie is a better quality sponge. I like to wash first with my favorite (Acure) face wash first. Then use the sponge to exfoliate &amp; get all the benefits of natural goodness this product offers. I now buy them as gifts for people too :)</li>
    <li> Wow! This is an amazing product! I have noticed less redness and dryness on my face. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I liked it but didn&#x27;t last long</li>
    <li> Great but wish it was 3 times bigger so I can use on my body</li>
    <li> I love this sponge.  I&#x27;m 57 and like to gently exfoliate every day.  This is gentle, and effective.  I use it over my closed eyes and eyebrows too.  Much better than a washcloth.  I have read about the advantages of turmeric and I don&#x27;t know how it will affect skin in regard in inflammation but I will definitely be buying this again.</li>
    <li> It does leave your skin feeling soft. However, the feeling only lasts for a few minutes after having used it. I dont see any proof of exfoliation.</li>
    <li> Amazing product for daily cleansing of skin.</li>
    <li> This sponge is so nice and very easy to use.  My face and neck feels and looks (most importantly) so smooth and clear, once I&#x27;m done.  I will continue to use and buy FOREVER!!!!!  Thank you so much for producing such a wonderful product that works so well for my sensitive skin.  Will be on the lookout to try others that are just as suitable.  Again, thank you forever.</li>
    <li> This Konrad sponge with turmeric is really great. My skin is very sensitive to many skincare products so using a sponge that doesn&#x27;t require soap or cleansing creme is wonderful. My skin feels soft, clean and rejuvenated. I highly recommend this sponge.</li>
    <li> I have used the Leonie Tumeric Konjac Sponge for a few days now. So far, I like it. Although I have not seen any miraculous changes, I do appreciate the daily gentle exfoliation and the ability to cleanse my face without cleanser. I also appreciate that it came with a suction cup to hang it up to dry. It is also a smaller size than another konjac sponge I purchased, but I think the smaller size is perfect for my face. The other brand konjac sponge I purchased did not come with a suction cup. Overall, I would purchase this again if I continue to be pleased with it.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect when I ordered this sponge, but I absolutely love it. After just one week, my skin is softer and I think looks better than before I used it.  Update : After using for awhile, my eyes got seriously dry -- -the skin around them got very scaly and I had remembered reading this in earlier reviews. Sadly, it happened to me so I no longer use.</li>
    <li> The perfect balance of exfoliation texture and gentleness for everyday cleansing. The sponge is really soft and you don&#x27;t need much force to use it. Just lightly massage your face and you&#x27;re done. I don&#x27;t even use any cleanser with the sponge and I use it on a daily basis. Very  nice.</li>
    <li> The Konjac sponge arrived timely in a properly heat sealed package.  Yes, the sponge was damp inside, but it did not smell weird.  It was very clean and oh so soft to use.  Never felt a sponge this soft.  I have only had it for a week and the first time I used it, my face turned red.  I believe it is from the gently exfoliating action.  I also did not apply a moisturizer afterwards.  Since then, I have been using it twice a day and apply a toner, serum and moisturizer on my face afterwards.  My friends tell me that my face has a healthy glow with a light, natural blush on my cheeks.  I do not use any cleanser with the sponge and I do not apply any makeup at all.  I am 41 years old and purchased the turmeric sponge, because I freckle easily.  It has been only a week, but so far I enjoy the softness of the sponge and the mild exfoliating effect.  It is also very easy to use, although I do not hang it up in my bathroom to dry (no proper air flow).  I hang it up in the bedroom and it usually will take several days to dry so it is never totally dry if I use it twice a day.  I am its only user and I intend to boil it for a few minutes once a month to get the germs out.  I&#x27;ll have to see how long it lasts.  This is my first review on Amazon.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Could not use.  Prefer the original Konjac sponge.</li>
    <li> I love my Turmeric Konjac sponge - bought a second one for my sister&#x27;s Easter basket!  It makes my skin feel so smooth and soft without adding chemicals and lotion!</li>
    <li> I have been used it for 3 days now and so far so good for sure dont notice any thing on my face now, i use it with my foaming clenser to clean my face and neck.</li>
    <li> I ordered this sponge after reading about it in a beauty blog. I ordered the yellow one for matured skin. It is supposed to help with age spots. So far, my skin is looking pretty good! It is smooth and exfoliated. I add my own soap so I can have the clean feeling when I am done. I have only used it for a week but am pretty impressed with the results!</li>
    <li> I have seen some improvement in my skin since using this sponge.  It is not too harsh which can be a problem with stiff brushes but not so soft as to not do anything.  I am pretty sure I will be purchasing this again once mine is used up!</li>
    <li> Loved the fact that there are different types of sponges depending on type of skin. It&#x27;s a rarity to have an offering for those of us with maturing skin. The shape and size accommodates well in my hand. I&#x27;ve haven&#x27;t quite grasped the concept that cleanser is not necessary, that the components of the  sponge is enough. Only reservation I would have is not the actual product but the packaging that it comes in- too much plastic for my taste; otherwise, I&#x27; m happy massaging clean my face!</li>
    <li> Love this product - it works well with my sensitive skin and it leaves my skin smooth and clean. I highly recommend buying this sponge.</li>
    <li> I was a bit hesitant to believe all the reviews on these sponges, but was pleasantly surprised after I used it for the first time.  My skin texture was smoother and felt incredibly soft.  And that was without cleanser!  It left my skin feeling very clean and &amp;#34;awake&amp;#34; (not sure how to describe it) without any drying sensation.  When I awoke the next morning, it still felt good and skin tone was more even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tonight will be ,my second use and I am looking forward to seeing the results.  Very effective, does what it says, and is so much cheaper than other beauty products!</li>
    <li> I tried the turmeric and the charcoal sponges.  I have mature, 55 year old skin, that is sun damaged and still oily in the T-zone.  Both cleaned really well, but the charcoal sponge dried out my skin too much (flaking/peeling on cheeks and forehead).  However, the turmeric sponge was incredible.  It made my skin so smooth and clean without drying.  Just like they said it would :)  I would recommend the charcoal sponge if you have younger, oil skin; and the turmeric sponge for those with more sensitive or mature skin.  Both were packaged so that they arrived wet.  They dry out and then become soft and supple when soaked in water before using.  I will definitely be buying again.</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly. Just started using and I like it so far. I would recommend especially for those who have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This is my first Leonie Turmeric Sponge. It removes dead skin gently and is better than any other face sponge I have used. My face is very smooth after using it. Worth the price.</li>
    <li> Delivers exceptional facial smoothing that leaves your face feeling like a baby&#x27;s bottom! Minimizes and refines your pores especially if you have large ones. Get rid of your blackheads! Always use your apple cider vinegar or toner afterward to restore face to full PH balance. Use of this sponge is only for gentle exfoliation as is described.</li>
    <li> I recently bought a Konjac sponge, and I am loving it!  My face feels so smooth, but it is so gentle that I my skin is also not abused.  I also bought a Clarisonic a few months back, and now I am regretting that purchase.  I think the Konjac sponge gets as good, if not better results!&lt;br /&gt;I have the sponge for mature skin, turmeric....so can only report on that.  Looking forward to seeing what the longer term results will be.</li>
    <li> I love the texture of this sponge right from the start. Add a little cleanser and it produces a thick lather. Skin feels soft and smooth after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely recommend to friends.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I wanted to try this to see if everything I&#x27;ve heard about them is true, and although most people I know use cleanser with this, it works well without any, making it great for traveling. I love the pamphlet&#x27;s suggestion that when you&#x27;re done with it, to use it in your plant containers for additional source of water for your plants.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Face feels fresh each time.</li>
    <li> I am using the sponge and I like it.  I am not sure of the bebefits but I do like it better than a washcloth.</li>
    <li> I currently use Differin, which causes my skin to be even more sensitive than usual.  The konjac sponge never aggravates my skin, and gets rid of the little flakies I can wake up with.  It&#x27;s a great, non-abrasive exfoliating tool.</li>
    <li> Excellent texture, great quality.  They last up to 3 months and maintain their shape nicely.  I prefer them to other brands</li>
    <li> I saw a similar product (the charcoal version) on a wellness type of show &amp; just had to check into it.  I am really leery of face scrubbers because it really is possible to create more problems than you solve when you use a &amp;#34;scrubber&amp;#34; that is either too harsh or with irregular edges (causes scarring).  This one is such a lovely, simple  addition to a skincare routine.  I&#x27;m pretty sure that I&#x27;m using less cleanser &amp; am getting a gentle effective cleansing - I can really see the difference in my pores.  I love that it is simple and hygienic - just thoroughly rinse after each use.  I dries VERY quickly so bacteria doesn&#x27;t have to chance to contaminate - when the sponge is dry it is hard so make sure to wet it well before use.  There are a number of versions depending on your skin type too.  The price of this sponge is offset by needing less cleanser - pays for itself.  Am so happy I found this product - is definitely going to be a repeat purchase!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a little less than a week now and so far I&#x27;m pleased with the results. It leaves my skin feeling super soft and exfoliated. I do use it along with my facial cleanser at night to remove make up but in the morn I just use the sponge with warm water.</li>
    <li> Very gentile yet very effective sponge. I highly recommend it for any one; especially for seniors. I recommend the body sponge too. My only suggestion is they would attach a string to the body sponge to hang when not being used.</li>
    <li> This sponge is my favorite of the 3 I&#x27;ve tried; green tea, charcoal and tumeric. It actually feels a little moisturizing when I use it! I don&#x27;t really use physical exfoliants anymore so this allows me to scrub after a day of yard work or a camp out or something, without actually damaging my skin.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any difference.</li>
    <li> This thing is really small. I would not order it again. I wish they had one 10X bigger. That&#x27;s all I got!</li>
    <li> I love it!  It makes my skin feel so soft and smooth.  I love the fact that I&#x27;m not using any soap on my skin!  Good cleansers are so expensive and I&#x27;m avoiding that using this sponge.  I am very happy with this product and will buy again!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this sponge! It is so easy to use and feels great. It has replaced my Clarisonic! I will definitely be buying more in the future. Also, it was delivered very quickly with no problems!</li>
    <li> LOVE this on my face!  A gentle scrub-nothing too harsh but you can still feel it working!</li>
    <li> I purchased two Konjac sponges a couple of months ago - this turmeric one as well as a charcoal one. I have to say I didn&#x27;t expect much, but was pleasantly surprised. I love them both and prefer to alternate them. The texture of this turmeric one, when dry, is a little harder than the charcoal one. It takes a little longer when running under water to soften up and begin to feel like a sponge you can use on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They really work so well. Personally, I do still use a little cleanser on my face, or apply a dab to the sponge. A little cleanser goes a long way though, because the sponge does seem to help it foam up more easily. I have been a loyal user of the Clarisonic for daily face washing for years. I have to say, I honestly believe I&#x27;ve noticed a better improvement with these sponges. My face feels cleaner when I&#x27;m finished and the texture and appearance of my skin seems to have improved. It&#x27;s smoother and just looks healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also struggle with adult acne at times, but since using these sponges, I have noticed that I have really not had any breakouts. The rest of my routine has remained the same, in terms of using a face wipe to wipe off my makeup somewhat before washing my face (I find this helps), and the other products I use. So I think the sponges must be helping. They&#x27;re durable and have a tiny string attached to them, so you can hang them to dry when you&#x27;re finished. For the price, it&#x27;s worth giving it a shot. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> This was my first time trying out the Konica sponge. The first day I tried it without any face wash and noticed my skin felt clean and a lot smoother.  After a week of use, I can already see a difference in that my face is brighter with less dark spots. Can&#x60;t wait to see what my face looks like a month from now. I love that it is a natural product, feels like a mini massage on the skin. I will also be saving $$$ since I won&#x27;t be needing face wash anymore.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! It leaves your skin feeling smooth and clean. I like that it&#x27;s simple to use and small enough to maneuver easily. No miracles but it delivers what it promises!</li>
    <li> its amazing you can see the result in 2 weeks</li>
    <li> Within 3 days of adding the sponge to my regiment, my face broke out -- not in pimples or blotches, but acne.  Meanwhile, absolutely nothing had changed in my cosmetic products, diet, medications (exactly 2 of them, the dosage of which has remained the same for nearly a decade, sleep pattern, or stress level.  Nothing.  So, now I&#x27;m using my 20something daughter&#x27;s prescription sulfacetamide lotion, which she applies when she occasionally gets a pimple, and praying I&#x27;ll get rid of these red mounds before attending a conference this weekend.</li>
    <li> Turmeric konjac sponge not worth the extra money.  Very small sponge.  I like my Black Paint sponge better it was cheaper, larger,free shipping, and I received it in two days.  This company took almost two weeks to get the producgt to me.</li>
    <li> I love this facial sponge and have used it regularly since purchasing a couple weeks ago. My face feels smoother as a result. I plan to buy another for myself and for my daughters. Thanks for the fast shipping too!</li>
    <li> Wonderful. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> At 44, I&#x27;m beginning to get the dullness of middle-aged skin so I needed something to exfoliate.  I also suffer from mild rosacea and occasional ezcema flare-ups, so it had to be very gentle.  I have been using it for nearly 4 months and I am very happy with it.  The slightly rubbery texture exfoliates without reddening or abrading my skin.  My skin has regained a lot of its smoothness.  I plan to keep using it in anticipation that it continues to deliver on its claim.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Clarisonic for years, but thought I&#x27;d give this a try based on the reviews and am glad I did.  It&#x27;s different, but definitely leaves my face feeling soft and clean, but not dry.</li>
    <li> Not as braisive as it needs to be.</li>
    <li> UPDATE:  I did not see a difference between washing my face with a baby wash cloth (soft on one side, textured on the other).  In fact, I noticed that my skin was drier from exfoliating every other day with this sponge.  I stopped using it, started using a wash cloth again - exfoliating a couple times a week with the textured side, and my skin is better.  Not a miracle product, in my opinion.   I am 30 years old with 2 young kids - which means my skin and hair have completely changed in the last several years :( .  My skin, which was once oily and acne prone, is now very dry with hormonal breakouts.  Also, it seems that it needs to be exfoliated on a daily basis, as it quickly begins to feel a little rough and look dull.  I have a very minimal skin regimen:  cleanse with a natural soap and moisturize with some Argan oil.  I needed something to replace my not so natural Queen Helene Aloe Exfoliating scrub.  I considered making my own, but I don&#x27;t have time or patience for that.  After a quick search, I found this little guy.  I checked out some reviews and decided to give it a shot, since it met my requirements of an all natural, daily exfoliator.  My first impression was that it was not exfoliating enough.  However, after the third consecutive day of using it, my skin felt nice and smooth.  I was just used to a more abrasive scrub, and this is probably safer for my skin than what I was using.  It seems to be a good daily exfoliator that will keep your skin soft and smooth.  It should be noted that I do not have sensitive skin.  Some people have claimed that these sponges have actually caused them to breakout.  In my personal experience, whenever my skin is being stimulated by something new, it does tend to break out.  But, I think that is the impurities that are just sitting there under the surface, and it is like a detox.  If I do breakout, I really think it will be from that and not so much the material of the sponge.  As for use, I decided to wash my makeup off with a gentle soap first, and then use this with just water.  I really love how clean my face feels after using it.  I love that I only need water to feel a true clean.  It is an easy step to add into my precious no-kid time at night (and I&#x27;m all about protecting my kid free time and making it as efficient as possible!).  Also, I really love that there is a suction hook to hang it on so it can dry out (I read in a review to make sure to squeeze out as much water as possible so that it is as light as can be to avoid the sponge falling apart at the string).  My husband picked it up and used it on his skin and head (he shaves it with guard 1, and has some exposed skin at the front where his hairline goes back), and he really liked it.  He isn&#x27;t the type of a guy who enjoys excess grooming things, so I am going to jump on it and get him one as well.  However, I think I&#x27;ll get him one that they claim is better for oily/acne prone skin, since that is what he has.  All in all, I like it.  However, could you get the same scrub with a wash cloth?  Maybe....so thats why I left a star off.  If I still like it when it is falling apart, I&#x27;ll totally get another.</li>
    <li> Great sponge. Really softens and smooths skin. Love!</li>
    <li> Good exfoliating sponge. Gets in all the corners well. I have not really noticed a difference between the colors. They are each supposed to do something different, but I don&#x27;t notice it. I have tried four different ones. A little expensive, but they last a long time. I was fortunate to get these on sale.</li>
    <li> I bought this sponge because it was the only konjac sponge with turmeric in it and I am in love with that spice. I lived in India for almost 10 years and many women there swear by turmeric for its exfoliating and anti-aging properties. The sponge itself is fun to use as it makes a squishy sound but leaves my face very clean even without cleanser.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually white reviews for skin products because I don&#x27;t seem to have amazing results from any product.  This is one product that I have a noticed a difference.  The first thing I noticed was that I wasn&#x27;t having breakouts....which even at 52 I still get on a regular basis.  I also think and my husband agrees that my skin is brighter and the wrinkles aren&#x27;t as pronounced.  My skin doesn&#x27;t seen as dry.  I also have the French Clay that I alternate with the turmeric sponge.  Fantastic product and you cannot beat the price!</li>
    <li> I have tried it for a week now and like a lot. It&#x27;s gently exfoliates and massages my face skin and skin looks more plump. I would like to try now other sponges from this brand with different infusions.</li>
    <li> 5 STARS....ABSOLUTELY SAW RESULTS WITHIN A FEW DAYS.  MAY GIVE AS CHRISTMAS GIFTS TO MY 4 BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTERS. GLAD I READ THE ARTICLE LEADING ME TO THIS WONDERFUL PRODUCT.  WILL PURCHASE AGAIN FOR SURE. THANKS.</li>
    <li> Good sponges - especially helpful if you have dry, flaky winter skin.</li>
    <li> It worked great HOWEVER after less than 1 month it started growing MOLD !! I did rinse it after each use and squeezed the moisture out. It was hung so that air flowed all around it. Not sure what the problem is. Not satisfied.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week now and it did wonders to my skin. I have a sensitive skin and even cleansers/soaps for sensitive skin, still leave my face flaky on the sides.  And now is almost gone, it has reduced at 90%.  It exfoliates without irritating my skin, I have also noticed an slight glow to my face, can&#x27;t wait to continue seeing the improvements!</li>
    <li> I love this sponge, it leaves my face feeling great.</li>
    <li> I love this sponge. It feels great to use and my skin is soft and clear afterwards.  I use it with and without cleansing products.</li>
    <li> Does work well without any cleanser, although mostly I use a touch. Face feels very smooth after use.</li>
    <li> Most nights, I use the oil cleansing method (castor oil and olive oil) to clean my face. However, after yoga class, when traveling, and on days when I don&#x27;t wear makeup, I want something quick, easy, and portable. I had read good things about konjac sponges, so I decided to give one a try. I chose this one with turmeric because my skin is on the sensitive side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy with this product. It is not only simple and portable, but it makes my face feel super clean and smooth but not at all dry. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have replaced all of my other exfoliators with daily use of a konjac sponge and this one works great. My last one I bought that was a different brand fell apart in about a month which was pretty disappointing. This one is much denser and I don&#x27;t think will have the same problem. They&#x27;re supposed to latabout 3 months bfore needing replacement if you take care of them. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see what effects turmeric has on my skin, but I&#x27;ve heard good things. It shipped and arrived in 48 hrs. It was even delivered on a Sunday. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I love the way my skin feels after using the Turmeric Konjac sponge. A nice clean feeling without being dry. Also, I like the shape of the sponge. I have only used for a short time but I plan to reorder for myself and friends.</li>
    <li> Great sponge. My skin feels so clean after using it.</li>
    <li> Like the way it cleans my face and makes if feel soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical, as is my nature, that a mere sponge could make any difference.&lt;br /&gt;I was wrong! two uses I noticed a difference in my skin&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;appearance. Three days later, I received compliments on my skin,&lt;br /&gt;asking what I did. :) Go figure! I do not have perfect skin, age spots, sun damage (loved&lt;br /&gt;the sun for years) and acne scars. That being said, the little tiny&lt;br /&gt;sponge has helped in a very short time.The company contacted me&lt;br /&gt;before I received the sponge, with instructions, etc.. I did contact them&lt;br /&gt;and they immediately replied. I would buy again, definitely.</li>
    <li> I really like this little sponge. It has a very unique feel, and is fun to use. It&#x27;s totally sensitive of my very sensitive skin. I want to love the clarisonic, but it&#x27;s not great for my sensitive skin. This is actually much better for me.</li>
    <li> I was amazed at how nice this sponge is and how clean my face felt, even when using no cleaners or soap. I will definitely order again .</li>
    <li> Texture great for providing the perfect amount of exfoliation. Not sure if the Turmeric adds to anything since I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to but sounds like a good idea. I would get another one once this one deteriorates.</li>
    <li> This is my first purchase and I must say from the first use I am very pleased.  The packaging was nice, but not hard to open.  The sponge is gentle but has great exfoliating properties.  I have had the sponge for 5 days and I can tell the difference.  My skin looks brighter.  I am looking forward to my next purchase.</li>
    <li> At first, I was hesitant to try the Konjac Sponge.  When I decided to, I was amazed at how gentle it is to the skin.  I am a senior citizen and I have dry patches on my forehead even though I use moisturizer daily.  The sponge gently evens out the rough parts and my skin feels soft after use.  Thank you for this sponge.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the Leonie Konjac sponge. I thought that it was just hype about how I would immediately feel and see the difference in my skin, but it&#x27;s not!  My skin felt smoother that it ever has even  smoother than when I&#x27;ve had professional chemical peels. Also, the peels didn&#x27;t eliminate the darkish mask  I had around my chin and mouth area due to aging and the effects of the sun, but the Leonie Konjac has cleared most of it up in about a week&#x27;s time. I kept looking in the mirror to confirm that most of the discoloration was gone because I couldn&#x27;t believe what I was seeing, smooth, clear, and  glowing skin !  The Leonie Konjac is now a part of my daily regimen.  My next purchase will be one for my body, can&#x27;t wait!</li>
    <li> Love that this is anti-bacterial, my face is feeling smoother after just a few days!</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! My skin has never looked better, and breakouts cleared up in two days. Will definitely continue to order</li>
    <li> I have been using this a couple of times a day since receiving it and I love how it feels. This is definitely not a cheap sponge that will fall apart in no time. If you use it as instructed it should last for a long time.</li>
    <li> Not sure if this has helped but it feels good.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a week and really like the way my skin feels.  I use the sponge alone, with no cleanser, and my face feels very clean and not at all dry.</li>
    <li> Really wonderful! Makes my skin feel soft but does not scratch. Wonderful to be using natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> Nicest Konjac sponge by far.  I have purchased some other Konjac sponges from different retailers and have been pleased with the way they cleanse my skin.  I have to say so far this is the best one.  The thing I am most happy with is the shape, most Konjac sponges are round and somewhat hard to wash with.  The sponge&#x27;s pear shape makes it easier to hang on to therefore easier cleanse with.  It comes with a suction cup holder (also a happy plus).  The sponge itself is a marvel.  I cannot believe how clean my face feels after cleansing with this sponge.  I am very happy with my purchase and I definitely will buy again and recommend. Excellent product.  *The manufacturer will send you an e-mail promising a 50% off coupon if you review this product.  This is my second purchase of the sponge and I never got that coupon so be warned.</li>
    <li> Second time ordering this product. I liked the way it felt on my skin. It was very gentle and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Unexpectedly soft, lathers really well, and leaves the skin feeling soft and healthy! Wish the sizes were larger!</li>
    <li> I felt the difference on my skin (softness) immediately; after 3 days later  friends asked me. ...&amp;#34;.did you do botox&amp;#34;?.......say no more. .....</li>
    <li> Love this magical sponge! After the first use I wasn&#x27;t impressed but after using it for a few days I can tell a huge difference in the smoothness and radiance of my skin. Will definitely be keeping this in my skincare regimen.</li>
    <li> This sponge is great, I feel a difference in the smoothness of my skin and I live how i is biodegradable and natural. Turmeric  has great anti aging properties! Can&#x27;t wait to try their other sponges</li>
    <li> The first sponge I received was opened and I was disappointed.  Great customer service.  Within 24 hours customer service contacted me to facilitate a return or exchange.  When I received the replacement sponge, it was unopened, and I really like it.  It really cleans your face and it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin or leave any residue.</li>
    <li> I have been using the turmeric konjac sponge for 5 days and already notice an improvement in facial skin tone and reduction in flaws.  Hopefully continued usage will result in further improvements.  I also use a lot less cleansing product with the sponge.</li>
    <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this sponge.  Living in FL ( and like being in the sun) has caused my skin to toughen up. Once I started using this sponge my skin has returned to its soft, smooth , albeit older texture.</li>
    <li> I love this sponge!  I noticed a definite difference after the first use.  I cleanse my face first, then message my face and neck twice a day with the Konjac Sponge.  It is very soft, infused with turmeric,  it fully exfoliates my face and neck.</li>
    <li> The sponge is a little firmer than other sponges and exfoliates my skin.  My skin feels softer and (I think) looks brighter.  I think it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
    <li> Having rosacea at age 64 it is difficult to find products that don&#x27;t dry out, irritate or bring on a full blown outbreak. My dermatologist told me to use Vanicream soap and moisturizer, period. Those products did not improve my overall skin but they did keep me from having horrible flair ups. I also never felt as though my skin is really getting moisturized. I was always trying more and more expensive products to try and find help. And all it would take is one day to find out if it was a success or failure. And so far all have been failures. Until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me say that I know there is a 50% off coupon reward for posting a positive review for the Leonie sponge, but if you want to check.....I NEVER give reviews! But in the week that I have been using this sponge my skin feels cleaner than it has in YEARS and it hasn&#x27;t dried my face out. Plus the large pores on the nose area don&#x27;t seem as prominent, there has been no fair ups, no irritations and even with the basest of moisturizer (the Vanicream, which is what Pharmacists use as the base compound for mixing ingredients) my skin feels amazing. I have only used the soap a couple of times and plan on going a week without using it and see what happens. I am actually keeping a record of how my skin looks and feels each day and am excited to see how this all pans out in a 30 day period. Buy it or not, it has no affect on me one way or the other, but I am absolutely tickled with this sponge and plan on ordering a bunch to keep and a few to give to friends.</li>
    <li> I love this sponge! This does the job very well....better than I expected. It keeps my skin looking and feeling great.....without a cleanser. I love the shape, too. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 9 months, now. I&#x27;m 66, and I&#x27;ve always been blessed with a good complexion, but, this makes it look more radiant, smoother and firmer. I always, toss it in my handbag, when I&#x27;m on the go. I keep it in the little plastic zip lock bag, that it comes in, so it stays wet enough to use, whenever you&#x27;re ready. It&#x27;s great for freshening up, during the day, and, it&#x27;s a must in the summer. It&#x27;s great for after a workout, convenient in the car, on a plane......anywhere. I just rinse it out, when I get home....and, it&#x27;s ready for the next time. I will never be without my, Leonie Turmeric Konjac Sponge, again.</li>
    <li> wonderful pampering of your face. I am gland I discovered these. never will I be without them</li>
    <li> I never write reviews however I&#x27;ve used this everyday since I&#x27;ve bereceived it.......7 days ago.  I noticed a difference the first day.  My face felt soft after I used it and all day after that.  The same goes for the next day.  Since then it&#x27;s only getting better and better.,softer and it a nice sheen to my complexion.  I bought the one with Turmeric in it.  LOVE this product it&#x27;s definitely 5 sponges for me.</li>
    <li> Im already a HUGE fan of all the konjac sponges I&#x27;ve used...that is, except for the ones that jag any special ingredients added. The others, being of varying brands, have broke my acne prone, sensitive skin out. They have also been expensive. This I went ahead and tried because of the turmeric specifically. I can&#x27;t rave about it enough! My skin is smooth, my pores are smaller, more even and radiant!! I&#x27;m in love! I&#x27;ve only been using it for three days!</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have purchased this brand of sponge.  I just love how well it cleans my skin and it leaves it feeling soft and clean.  It is very gentle on my skin.  I will continue to purchase this sponge.</li>
    <li> It wakes me up in the morning when I&#x27;m getting ready for work.  Other than that I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s really doing anything else.</li>
    <li> Very nice, will purchase again in the future.</li>
    <li> Just used it for the first time...everyone is getting on for Christmas !!!  My skin feels like a baby&#x27;s !!!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!!!!! It came packaged so professionally. It has a brochure on the different konjac sponges, the benefits of each kind, how to use it, etc. I was impressed when it came in a sealed plastic bag and it was moist and immediately ready to be used. The quality is amazing as well. I use it every day for over two weeks and it looks brand new. I have bought other brands and they always seem to start falling apart after a couple weeks. The most important reason why I love this sponge is because of how it works so incredibly well. I know the turmeric one is designed for aging skin....but even though I&#x27;m in my mid 20s, I can see a huge difference in my skin after using it. My skin is very fair, often with some red patches on my cheeks (from sun/wind sensitivity). I&#x27;ve noticed that the sponge always makes me look so refreshed, young, and glowy in the mornings after I use it the night before. I usually use it every night before bed, and with no other cleaners or soaps. I love the fact that it is so convenient and easy to use. I noticed that with this particular brand, it does not require a long time to &amp;#34;soak&amp;#34; it before using. I sometimes use it in the mornings as well on the mornings that I do not shower. This is an amazing product, and as far as I&#x27;m concerned it is the best of it&#x27;s kind. Also, I have tried the activated charcoal in another brand, and the turmeric one in this brand....I highly recommend the turmeric. I got the activated charcoal before because I have acne prone, fair skin. However, the turmeric one seems to take care of my acne and make me glow even more. This is one of the most amazing products I&#x27;ve ever ordered on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I love these facial sponges. They provide a great overall cleaning for skin and are delicate, yet do the job of other more abrasive devices. The fact that it is natural just adds to its appeal for me. The price is affordable too. This little miracle is now a permanent part of my daily skin routine - the results have been noticeable!</li>
    <li> This sponge is very nice.  I love the softness and ease of use.  I&#x27;m definitely going to re-order.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a great product.</li>
    <li> I read about these sponges in a health magazine and gave it a try.  Amazingly,  using it makes my skin silky and smooth, just like everyone says. It is gentle, not abrasive at all so you can use it every day.  I am 67, my skin has been a trial all my life yet thanks to this little sponge it&lt;br /&gt;is the clearest it has ever been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s tidy, it hangs on your mirror or tile wall and is  actually rather fun to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;use.</li>
    <li> i keep this in the shower and it is very easy to use and my skin doesn&#x27;t feel dried out!</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t the first Konjac sponge I&#x27;ve bought. I&#x27;ve tried about 5 different brands and I&#x27;d have to say this is my second favorite next to the Pursol Konjac sponge. I deducted a star because it&#x27;s not as durable as the other sponges that I&#x27;ve used but it&#x27;s still great quality. Konjac sponges are awesome and although they don&#x27;t last very long, they do a great job with cleaning the skin deeply and gently.</li>
    <li> Today is May 12, 2014; I received the turmeric konjac sponge on May 7.  With the first use I felt it left my skin with a very clean feeling without drying it.  I used just tepid tap water, no cleanser, morning and night. Previously, no matter how good a cream cleanser was, it left a coating on my skin.  As a septuagenarian, I hope to reasonably slow the inevitable march of time with continued konjac good cleansing and the use of sunscreen. This works like a Mr. Clean household block sponge ! - but gentle, for the face and neck, a good thing.  If possible hang the sponge where it&#x27;ll catch a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;Calyx</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t worth the price, Walmart $2 sponges are better.  If you need some real exfoliation and massage, it wouldn&#x27;t work for you.</li>
    <li> I really like this sponge. I don&#x27;t think I have ever used anything like it. But it makes my face feel so clean and soft. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> This sponge makes your skin feel wonderful, they are so natural and gentle whilst moisturising I would highly recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> What a difference.  Age spots actually look a little better and my skin is much smoother. Very happy I found this great sponge.</li>
    <li> I saw no difference in my skin at all, but it was a nice face scrubby.</li>
    <li> I love this - I was skeptical but I will keep ordering them. I use this after my con air exfoliating brush and it makes my face as soft and smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt. There are several kinds for the face and I haven&#x27;t tries the others but I&#x27;m very impressed with this one.</li>
    <li> This sponge is great! I bought one given the good reviews and I had read about the benefits of using a Konjac sponge. I have used it twice; first at the end of the day, after using a make-up remover and then using it in the morning pre make-up. Both times, the sponge feels great (very light and mushy) on the skin and left my skin clean and refreshed. Totally enthralled with the ability to plant a used sponge into a garden or potted plant to help with moisture etc.</li>
    <li> Have only used it for a week, but am very impressed! Will most definitely order this again. Going to get one for my daughter in South Africa.</li>
    <li> I purchased this sponge for the first time and have used it every other day for the last week and I have to say that my skin texture has definitely improved.  I was debating about buying a Clairsonic, but now I won&#x27;t.  I&#x27;ll just keep using the Leonie sponge!</li>
    <li> I absouletly love this sponge. I have the charcol sponge and I am getting ready to buy the green tea sponge! Great product!</li>
    <li> makes my skin smooth and softer than it used to be, but I don&#x27;t think it can completely replace scrub, at least during summer.&lt;br /&gt;Very interesting product, planning buy as gifts to friends</li>
    <li> I am so glad I found this sponge!  I love it so much that I purchased one for my 3 closest friends, my mom, and my sister.  It is so gentle yet somehow exfoliates everything away.  My skin is tighter, brighter, and feels so soft.  And it feels like a spa treatment while using it.  I cannot recommend this product enough.</li>
    <li> I hang it in the shower and use it in the morning.  It is soft, yet really feels like it is cleaning deep.  My first one lasted longer than I thought it would, with daily usage.  It was a gift from my daughter-in-law, and I liked it so much I ordered another one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll buy one for every one of my friends this holiday season, and they&#x27;ll thank me for the rest of their lives.  These sponges are incredible!  You won&#x27;t believe how your skin looks and feels!  Try one--just once, and you, too, will be hooked for life!</li>
    <li> This product is awesome. It&#x27;s made my skin so much softer without the use of soap. After washing my face it feels like my face is super soft and not right like it normally is after washing. Also, my face feels hydrated throughout the day. Love it!</li>
    <li> Thought I&#x27;d try this out after hearing rave reviews online and I have to say &amp;#34;I love how it makes my face feel!&amp;#34; Just soak it, add your cleanser and rub away the day! It&#x27;s so soft you hardly know you&#x27;re using it!</li>
    <li> Nothing special at all, mad at myself for believing the awesome reviews.  Can&#x27;t believe I spent this much money on a stupid sponge.</li>
    <li> Soak it well in warm water before use. Leaves your skin smooth and nice.</li>
    <li> When I got it i though this&#x27;s not going to work. But I decided to try it. After two weeks ooh i could feel a difference. But my strige to hang up broke off after a couple of days. Couldn&#x27;t hang to dry. : (</li>
    <li> I has this long standing problem with eczema in the corner of my right eye and eyebrow, also corner of nose. I tried scrubbing it, different creams including a prescription one. Nothing helped. Within four day&#x27;s of using the Konjac Sponge the eczema is gone. I think it maybe the ability to move the sponge into crevices in your face.  I am just happy to have the itchy, flakey mess off my face.</li>
    <li> I love that this sponge is very gentle on my skin. I can see some results after using it about 4 or 5 times. My skin is looking a tad bit brighter. I look forward to continued results!</li>
    <li> These feel so good. I enjoy mine and got one for my daughters mother. I hope she will enjoy it as much as I. I highly recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> this sponge came with it&#x27;s own suction cup hook for the shower. I felt an immediate difference. my skin was smoother without feeling dry and no redness.</li>
    <li> The sponge is just the right texture for gentle exfoliation.  I use this one just on my face, after cleansing, but I believe you could use it with a cleanser also.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and it&#x27;s holding up well.  I just squeeze the excess water out and hang to dry.</li>
    <li> The Leonie Tumeric Konjac Sponge seems to be working in regards to helping my acne not flaring up. As of now I am washing my face morning and evening with this sponge. I have been using neem soap with it. Using diluted Food Grade Hydrogen peroxide as a toner and vitamin C mixed with distilled water as a serum. Hoping to see results @ getting rid of acne.</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd time I&#x27;ve purchased this sponge because I really like it. It is not too harsh for my sensitive skin and did not flake apart as it aged, like many facial sponges have a tendency to do. Each sponge lasted about a year before it needed to be replaced.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Konjac sponge for mature skin. I like how smooth the sponge leaves my skin. I will most definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> I really like this sponge.  It makes my face feel clean without tightness.  I also like that it comes with a suction hook so I can hang it up to dry.</li>
    <li> I really like my new facial sponge. The turmeric smells light and aromatic. I have been having hormonal breakouts and the turmeric seems to be calming. I use it morning and night. I have not added my own cleaner, as I use a scrub a few times a week.</li>
    <li> With the first wash I could tell the difference. It does what it said it was going to do and my skin felt great awards. It comes with care instructions so you know how to treat this sponge. Outstanding product.</li>
    <li> I had never heard anything about this product! So, I was very curious to learn more about it. I also want to use all things 100 percent chemical free and organic. I know living most of my life in Florida,. I have had more than my share of sun exposure and now have the sun spots lightly pigmented on my very fair &amp; delicate skin. I am glad to find this product and has worked for me! I am a natural, green-eyed women and I have always been very concerned about good skin care. I am going to buy 2 more for my friends for their Easter goodie bag at our Easter lunch next week!  Jennifer D Gonzalez</li>
    <li> The reason these have such a high rating is that the company offers you 50% of your next purchase with a positive review. I like the product, but it starts deteriorating was too quickly (mostly because of the string they put through it for hanging - that area started falling apart after a couple weeks)... If these were half the price they would be worth it, because at this price you would need to spend around $100 per year... It seems like Konjac is just a very short lasting material.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m managing to use it every day and am enjoying the gradual change in my skin.  Really love this product</li>
    <li> I love my latest edition to my sponge collection.  this is my second sponge.  I absolutely love it, it&#x27;s gentle to my skin and feels great.  A huge step up from my washcloth, cleans easily after use.  I can use with our without my facial cleanser.  Gives my skin a pick me up.  I plan on buying another one to put in my suitcase!</li>
    <li> Skin felt smoother after one use. I will purchase it again in the future. I was skeptical at first but pleasantly surprised with the results. I use it daily now.</li>
    <li> I love using this sponge for my mature skin needsI have a 50% off coupon please send me another at 1/2 price the tumeric sponge I have and use am and pm is wonderful I would like to try the bare natural asap thanks much barbara childs 201 e howard a10 tryon nc 28782</li>
    <li> First let me say, the comany was fantaastic. They really care about the satisfaction of their customers which for me is very refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;I found the sponge to be okay, i was not sure what it was all about when I read about the sponge in a magazine article about beauty products  and I figured for $10 I could afford to try it.&lt;br /&gt;It does a great job exfoliating my skin and I like that I am not using chemicals etc. to do it but so far I so no real changes in my face BUT it has not even been about 10 days since I have started using it and I have no plan to stop using it so maybe with time I will see additional benefits.</li>
    <li> Did not know if this sponge would really work. have used for 5 days and can already tell a big difference in my skin. I really love this product and plan on ordering more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Konjac sponge for 2 weeks now. I love it! I have very dry &amp; sensitive skin. My skin is glowing and feels great.</li>
    <li> As a professional esthetician, I am always looking for new ways to clean and exfoliate the skin. Well I found it here--very gentle and stimulating. I like that you can use it on the lips and eyelid area and its provides a stimulating massage without being hard on that delicate skin tissue.I would definitely recommend it to family and friends. Fast and friendly customer service.</li>
    <li> Cant wait to try it!  Love my Konjac Sponges!</li>
    <li> Yes, it&#x27;s pricey, but I LOVE this sponge - the texture &amp; the fact that it has a little string hook for easy hanging/drying.  My sensitive, sun damaged skin loves it too.  After two weeks, my skin is glowing &amp; I have had NO allergic reaction, which is saying a lot since my skin is extremely sensitive.  I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect when I bought this, but I am so happy I did! The concept of cleanser-free washing is totally foreign to most of us, but my skin has vastly improved in only days since I started using it! After a light buffing, my skin glows and seems more receptive to my care products applied afterward. I use argan oil only and when I wake up, my skin looks renewed. I am really excited about this! All ladies with aging skin need one of these Konjac sponges! I ordered a clay based one for my teenage daughter and she loves hers as well. Get on board ladies! This is game changing!</li>
