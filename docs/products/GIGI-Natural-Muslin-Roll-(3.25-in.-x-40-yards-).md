<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works great. No issues.</li>
    <li> Major necessity. it grips the wax like nothing else. and if you are someone that will be doing A LOT of waxing this is a lot cheaper and more convenient than the pre-cut strips. i absolutely love these things. the only con is that they shed a little bit, but oh well, nothing is perfect!</li>
    <li> This is a must when using sugar wax. I cut the strips to the lengths that I need and I can use the strips more than once. I will always use muslin strips with sugar wax.</li>
    <li> I bought this item together with the whole set of waxing. They work great. I would recommend this set to my friends</li>
    <li> Great!! Easier to wax my legs I can cut the length I want!!</li>
    <li> I like that you cut the muslin to the size you are comfortable with but what I didn&#x27;t like was that the threads would get loose and the wax came through.  It&#x27;s a bit too thin for me.</li>
    <li> Not sure how much else you need to know about this product, it&#x27;s a roll of muslin for waxing.  There&#x27;s a lot of it, it&#x27;s a great width for waxing legs &amp; is easy to cut for use on other areas.</li>
    <li> Great price, great shipping time and great strips.  They are a nice quality, cut easily and I think I might have a life time supply now..</li>
    <li> Best muslin ever. Works like a dream and I love the convenience of the roll. You can just snip the size you need.</li>
    <li> I would buy this again, great price and easy enough to use. I feel the fabric is a touch too thin, but when there is so much I can let it go. The material has a tendency to leave threads around which I find annoying, but not a deal breaker.</li>
    <li> This roll is perfect for cutting custom size strips.  It is a large roll and should last a while.  Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Well, it&#x27;s basically like any other Muslin Roll I assume. My wife likes it, and not much to say about it</li>
    <li> This was what I was looking for. I like how it&#x27;s unbleached and you can cut to any size. Just like my salon uses so it&#x27;s perfect. Works well with the all purpose honee wax. Great buy!!</li>
    <li> Used it several times very satisfied with the results.</li>
    <li> I love it. Simple and precise.I used the other small strips and each time I forget some part of my legs.   With this roll is impossible to be imperfect.  I used it for 1 time and now I will never use others.</li>
    <li> This works great on long strips that need waxing.  Like my wife&#x27;s long legs.  Will be ordering more very soon.</li>
    <li> I just needed refills, so I probably didn&#x27;t need to buy such a large amount, but the price was right and now I just need to figure out a place to store it.</li>
    <li> Except for the few loose threads coming from the sides when you cut these into separate strips, the value is much better than buying the strips. These equal the amount of 3-4 packs of regular strips, so it&#x27;s the best deal out there.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m really happy with this purchase the roll was bigger than i thought, it came on time and in perfect conditions, excellent!</li>
    <li> This is a great product just make sure you have good sheers when you cut it or your home or business may look a little over decorated for Halloween. :)</li>
    <li> This product works great and would definitely butymore of. I would definitely do business with this company again.  Very Happy.</li>
    <li> Muslin strips are 10000 times better than the paper ones they put in the waxing kits. However these were too coarse, so you can&#x27;t reuse them as many times as I would like to. The wax goes through the strips by the second use which makes it messier since you&#x27;re touching it with your hands.    I find Natural Muslin Epilating strips by GiGi much more effective. Even though you can&#x27;t cut them the size you want, they work better and last longer, so will ultimately save you money.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! You can cut the strips to the length you need, and pull several strips on each length before discarding. Adheres very well to the sugar wax. Very tough and sturdy, and very easy to use. I highly recommend for home waxing of face, bikini, legs, underarms, etc.</li>
    <li> I use alot of this stuff to complete my torture effect when I yank the wax off my face. It&#x27;s hard trying to stay beautiful!</li>
    <li> This is a great value for as many waxing strips you can get out of this. You can cut any length easily. This isn&#x27;t a bad thing but beware when you first take it out of the wrapper all the left over strings go everywhere. Other than that they work great, you can reuse these strips too! Perfect match with my Satin Smooth Wax and GiGi Warmer!</li>
    <li> I have used this roll, it is really huge and will last long. The quality of it is really good. I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> Quality is kinda cheap, a lot of shreads come off and stick to your hands, because when you wax your legs with this product the wax consistently seeped through the material. Bad experience, I expected much better!</li>
    <li> I ordered one two years ago and its not even half way gone. I wax small areas about once every two weeks; upper lips, chin, eyebrows, and armpits. I&#x27;m very happy I invested in this because I probably have another two years I can get out of it. I love that you can cut the size and shape you want.</li>
    <li> Purchased this Muslin Roll to use with my home waxing kit. Works great! A lot better than the paper like one that came with my kit. Happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Perfect to go along with my waxing stuff. You just cut the length you need for what you are waxing and for at home use it lasts such a long time.</li>
    <li> Gigi brand is great, the muslin roll is perfect for body waxing, I usually use the same strip about 3 times or for a better example 1 strip per leg. If you know how to wax and apply a thin layer it works nice. If you don&#x27;t know how to wax keep practicing and keep your hands clean. Down side of the muslin is the wax can get through and make your hands sticky, another is if you cut small strips for facial wax the threads begin to fall off the edges. It&#x27;s still the best, I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else</li>
    <li> Item is exactly what I wanted , thank you!</li>
    <li> GIGI actually makes good muslin. I am not a GIGI fan , but this is a wonderful product from them, and I will be purchasing more.</li>
    <li> So perhaps I&#x27;m more old school but I think these are the best you really can buy as far as muslin for waxing. I bought one 11 years ago and just ran out! It&#x27;s huge when it comes to you and works on any type of hair waxing and any type of wax</li>
    <li> very good but only for use by women,not men&#x27;s work.i buy for my use and my boyfreind but does not work for</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using GiGi products for years and have always been very happy. This muslin is perfect, thick enough that wax doesn&#x27;t seep through and the roll is big enough to last a long time.</li>
    <li> It ripped down the middle a few times I used it. I would try the other type next time. But the roll looks like it will last a long time. The edges were cut straight so it frayed a lot. Makes a mess...</li>
    <li> I did not like. When I had trouble using it to adhere and the expected results were not satisfactory. ITry another type of fabric and it worked better.  think there are very economic fabric that best meet function.</li>
    <li> This was a total disappointment after having the wax and warmer also by Gigi.  Didn&#x27;t even use the whole roll- bought precut strips that were made out of different material after 1 session of use.  I think more wax seeped through onto my hands than stayed on my legs.  Super messy and the fabric sheds/frays. skip it and buy different strips!</li>
    <li> I’d definitely buy it again, it cleaned the area perfect without leaving any hair behind and really easy to use.</li>
    <li> This product works really well, I&#x27;m very happy with it :D I love that it&#x27;s one big roll so you can determine the length of your own strips.</li>
    <li> Product is thicker than what she normally uses.  Feels like good quality but, what do I know about stuff like this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Gigi muslin strips for waxing but decided to order the roll instead in hopes that I would get more out of it. I think it will last longer than the pack of pre-cut strips I had previously. This roll is good quality and the material seems a little thicker than the pre-cut strips. You definately need sharp scissors or pinking shears to cut this so it doesn&#x27;t fray and leave strings all over the place. Next time I need epilating strips I will re-order this instead of the pre-cut strips... I really like the fact that I can decide how long they need to be.</li>
    <li> Love this Gigi Natural Muslin Roll and it was at a great price. I have been using the same roll for the past 5 years and would not change it.</li>
    <li> It does the job. I like that I can cut my own strip sizes. I will point out that I am a waxing novice. I only wax myself. If you leave the strip too long on the honey wax, it will seep through a bit. This is why waxing takes practice and should be done quickly. Great product. Will purchase again when I run out.</li>
    <li> I love that I can make these into different lengths as needed. Perfect for any waxing. Defiantly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this and it came with 2 rolls at the time. It is pretty stringy but it gets all my hair off. I&#x27;m an Aftrican American female and I have thick coarse hair. Trust me it works. I started with some regular wax strips and they hurt lol. Then I got the Muslin wax strips and I loved them but I wax a lot and it just was one size. So I finally got the roll and I&#x27;ve never been happier. I would recommend this product to EVERYONE!</li>
    <li> I have always liked using this product - and I like it even better at these prices that amazon offers!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay for muslin. The strips themselves are nice, but expect it to unravel at the edges and make a lot of mess. I hang it on a ribbon tied horizontally around something so I can roll it easily to cut it, but the strings get all over everything especially while dealing with sugaring.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend.! Bid with confidence</li>
    <li> The muslin cloth is so much better than standard cloths for waxing. It grips the hair and the wax perfectly. For the cost you get plenty. Worth every plenty.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a muslin roll loyalist for a while now. I am moving on to FantaSea non woven strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-- Dirt cheap and gets the job done !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-- Wax bleeds through. Sticky hands are no fun.&lt;br /&gt;-- These shed threads ... a lot. Didn&#x27;t make me stop using them, but can be annoying to some.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what to say about this product. It is still sitting somewhere in the closet brand new. I bought this with the wax that came with it, same brand and it did not work. I had to was the same area over and over and needless to say I was in pain and tears at the end of this. Maybe it&#x27;s just that I didn&#x27;t have experience doing this, but either way I did not like this at all.</li>
    <li> GIGI natural muslin roll is durable and lasts long. I&#x27;ve had it for quite a while and use it very regularly.</li>
    <li> I have been using this wax for many years, the only thing is that it&#x27;s very hard if you have some wax left on your body to get rid of. You do need to get the cream that helps get rid of the wax.</li>
    <li> I wax often and love this! In my opinion these are by far the best strips! Not saying its painless though!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed. Huge, too. Easy to cut and store and will last forever. To add, it makes no mess.</li>
    <li> The edges shred alot, but I guess that is the same with all fabric waxing strips. The thickess is good though.</li>
    <li> It is very good quality and perfect thinness. It does not damage my skin but pick up wax and hair relatively easier.</li>
    <li> This is SO much better than the pre-cut strips. You can cut to your desire and it lasts so much longer!! I was buying the strips pretty often probably once a month and I purchased this a few months ago and I still have plenty left. It also doesn&#x27;t fray as bad as the pre-cut ones in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Easy and good quality!</li>
    <li> I was buying those teeny, tiny strips before I found this.  Man, this is fabulous.  You can cut off a long piece and do your lower legs with one piece, then your upper legs with another piece and be done in a flash.  The quality is fantastic so it removes the wax and hairs no problemo.  I am sold.</li>
    <li> GOOD QUALITY, WELL WORTHTHE MONEY.</li>
    <li> These are alright, they&#x27;re not bad and they get the job done. I do recommend getting cloth wax stops though, those work better.  Also wax won&#x27;t seep though if you don&#x27;t put so much wax on, a lot of wax won&#x27;t make the waxing better, just messier. I took cosmetology, I know how this works ;)</li>
    <li> This muslin roll is super because you can cut whatever size of strip you need to work with. The material is soft to the touch and the strip can be used several times before being discarded. It is professional quality and lasts a relatively long time. I have had mine for several full leg waxes now. I think it is the best strip to use!</li>
    <li> This Muslin tape roll is as big as the picture makes it seem. Was very impressed with the amount you get.</li>
    <li> I was shocked at how big the roll was. It was way larger then I expected. The strips work well for eyebrows. Only 4 stars because the shipping was 6 bucks. Also cutting the strips is a little tedious.</li>
    <li> Love these better than the pre-cut strips. You get  more for your buck. Great so you can cut to size</li>
    <li> very good product i love it i use it with all purpose gigi wax removes the smallest finest thin hair to the darkest coarse hair very good.</li>
    <li> Just like the stuff I used in high school cosmetology while learning how to wax. Works perfectly with hard wax. Gives you some extra grip instead of just ripping the wax off and I personally think it hurts less. You can cut the strips to any size you prefer. The only annoying thing is the loose strings that come off the edges sometimes but not to big of a deal. Very pleased will definitely order this again when i run out.</li>
    <li> I ordered this roll to use for larger areas. I had the small precut strips for my face, but I like how I can cut any size I want out the roll. I didn&#x27;t have any problems with fraying after cutting my strips, and the rolls seems to be a bit thicker than the precut strips.</li>
    <li> This material is very flexible and conforms well to all those weird spots that are hard to wax (knees are my nemesis). It does occasionally shed threads, but it&#x27;s not falling apart - just a few stray threads off the edge. This stuff combined with microwave wax works really well for me. My hair is NOT easy to pull out - Nair has absolutely no effect even if left on for 3x the recommended time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought GiGi Natural Muslin Rolls several times in the past and from other Amazon vendors.... However, the stuff I got from this seller in particular looked and felt very different - thinner and looser woven fabric. When I waxed my legs using this product the wax consistently seeped through the material and onto my hands making the experience that much more agitating. I have a strong suspicion that this item is actually a knock-off and not the REAL GiGi Natural Muslin Rolls (which are actually quite nice).</li>
    <li> it shreds all over the floor when you attempt to cut it.&lt;br /&gt;There are little pieces of fiber all over.</li>
    <li> last forever. works great. highly recommend. better than pre-cut strips...you can use one strip after you cut it several times before it gets to full of wax....very economical.</li>
    <li> Good with the Gigi coffee wax</li>
    <li> This product collects wax and hair nicely but if you press too hard it&#x27;s also taking pieces of your skin with it.&lt;br /&gt;I just recommended to be very careful and mindful of that and the little excess strings that tend to appear out of nowhere. Otherwise nothing but nice things to say about this product.</li>
    <li> Works well with the wax.</li>
    <li> I personally think if your gonna wax it shouldn&#x27;t be the cloth ones like this it should be like the paper ish kind or whatever it is like what they use for eyebrow waxing this didn&#x27;t work very good for me</li>
    <li> I bought the roll over the pre-cut strips and I&#x27;m glad I did.  It doesn&#x27;t take long to cut up the whole roll and was worth the savings.  The Muslin worked well enough.  Word of caution, if you put the wax on to thick it does soak through.  That was a noobie mistake.  &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Larger roll than I expected should last a long time for one person. Works well with GIGI All Purpose Honee wax.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for my at home eye brow waxing. Lots of value here</li>
    <li> Love cutting just what I need! Makes it really easy to use just the size you need. Good quality muslin.</li>
    <li> I love that I can cu my own length of strip needed, but these are VERY thin, and the wax goes straight through it. By the time I have one or two spots waxed, my hand is coated and it&#x27;s difficult to continue on without rubbing wax-off on my hand. I won&#x27;t be buying these again.</li>
    <li> The material is soft and works well.  When I used the strips, the hair came off easily and it was not sticky. I have no complaint.</li>
    <li> Anyway, its bad quality, its not easy to take wax away from your skin!!! Don&#x27;t buy it!! And it has strong smell!!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s not really sticky and smell good, unlike order gel or waxing. I will order again sometimes soon</li>
    <li> I perfer this material over the one I got with the kit actually!</li>
    <li> These strips are fantastic! I have an at-home wax kit and I use these strips quite frequently. One roll has lasted me over a year so far and it still has plenty to go. They are well made strips that are thick and sturdy. I love how I can cut off the just the right amount. I definitely will buy these again!</li>
    <li> Gigi wax machine, collars, muslin strips and baby oil are all required purchases.  The wax is extremely sticky!  This is the best product so far that has worked for me!  Transaction went very smooth!</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for, real &amp;#34;cloth&amp;#34; strips. Hate the ones that are half cloth half plastic. they are really rough on the bikini area. Thinking of bringing these to my Brazilian waxer!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for another person, hopefully they like it, as they wanted to try this product.</li>
    <li> I was really pleased with this Muslin Roll. It wasn&#x27;t too stringy as muslin can sometimes be when it is cut. This roll works well because you can cut the strips to your own preferred size, rather than buying the pre-cut strips which tend to be large and lead to a lot of wasted Muslin. I would recommend this for at-home use and also for Salon/Day Spa use.</li>
    <li> I am not used to this kind of strips, so I am learning to use them now, and it seems to be okay.</li>
    <li> Works well. Super large for professionals also.</li>
    <li> Recommend this product</li>
    <li> Item is as described. Love it!</li>
    <li> This is the best type of muslin I have used. I&#x27;ve used many types and brands and this has to be my favorite. highly recommend. I got the role because I wanted to cut according to my liking. Gigi also has muslin strips which is the same thing but already cut in strips.</li>
    <li> This muslin roll allows you to cut the strips the way you want and to save money. This is my second time purchasing the same product.</li>
    <li> I expected this product to be exceptional based on all the stars it has. I am very disappointed. The Muslin roll is way too thin. Very cheap material. The wax seeped through to the other side and made my hands sticky from the wax. Would not recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> The strips were great but some of strings were lose. This caused the material to get on my carpet and on my shirt which was annoying to get off.</li>
    <li> I like that I can cut them into my desired size/shape. The only issue I would see with this product, is if someone does want to sit there and cut each strip. (it might get tedious) It grips the hair as well as the normal strips</li>
    <li> Ok quality, does its job. It had threads popping out all over when arrived. muslin is on the thinner side. I prefer slightly thicker Gigi muslin, the quality was better before.</li>
    <li> Everything as described. Thanks</li>
    <li> I think Muslin is the best material for waxing. This frays a lot but is super convenient because you cut the size you want and reduce waste. Haven&#x27;t found anything better.</li>
    <li> Tenes para por lo menos unas 20 secciones de piernas y mucha sobra para las cejas ,en frente de clientas  quedas muy bien , el mundo real ,se usa cada rincon .</li>
    <li> I have been using this for many years now.  They work great and I can use the same strip over and over to get a whole arm waxed or the entire lower leg, sometimes even both arms.</li>
    <li> It  gripes hair nicely but sheds a lot. Make sure you Grab a broom or vacuum because its messy  to cut. only plus is that it is a lot for the cost.</li>
    <li> I like this Muslin Roll Waxing strips. I love that I am able to cut it into any length that I choose instead of being stuck and buying the ones that are already cut for you without them knowing your proffered length. What I like doing is cutting in up and folding in half--using both layers to strip away waxed area. That&#x27;s just me. It can get pretty stringy and undo itself but I figured that&#x27;s only if you have it thrown around.. the texture of it seems to pick up the light wax residue there after, which is a miracle. Good job, GIGI</li>
    <li> Amazon suggested I buy this with the hard wax that I bought, but you don&#x27;t need it. You ONLY need this for soft wax. Not a bad product, but just a FYI to future buyers.</li>
    <li> I use this with my gigi pot...the muslin is ok...its a bit thin, and frays like crazy..but does the job..would be easier to work with if it didnt fray as much, and the hot wax sometimes seeps through the thin fabric..not sure if thicker exists, but its a loooonnngggg roll..so ill be using this one for a long time!</li>
    <li> This is the best way to go when waxing. The muslin seems less painful in comparison to other products when pulling out hair. It&#x27;s easy to cut into any size you want. The roll is really big and will last a very long time; I&#x27;m still using one roll after about 30 waxes.</li>
    <li> This roll is very substantial and I am sure will last quite a while.  It is also a very nice product. The muslin is just thick enough but also very soft.</li>
    <li> I was debating on buying this versus pre-cut strips but went with the roll instead because of the price. Much cheaper. After cutting off a couple of strips, I realized that the roll sheds more than my dog. I wish I was exaggerating. Since I have carpet on the floor, this meant vacuuming right after. This pain in the neck is totally worth it. It successfully pulls off every strand of hair and sometimes even skin. But that was my fault because I was in a rush and forgot to cool off the extremely hot wax before placing it on my skin. I was completely impressed to see my bit of skin and blood on the strip though. That meant it totally works. Be careful not to burn your skin off though. It&#x27;s not fun. Just like the hot shower I took right after. I am not proud of that day.</li>
    <li> Very long lasting and practical to cut pieces as needed, it is really great to have it in a roll!</li>
    <li> Very clean, and it works great if you use it right. It never falls apart on you or shreds, so this is one time you should definitely splurge for a name-brand product.&lt;br /&gt;My only issue was that I had a little trouble tearing it, but a pair of scissors easily fixed that.</li>
    <li> This is very strong flexiable. great way to save money. Only down side is the ends tend to \\&quot;shed\\&quot; Great for any size of waxing</li>
    <li> It was really stringy and it kinda fell apart. Its just sitting in a corner in my room now. Dont know what to do with it.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and just as described. All Gigi products are great for home use.</li>
    <li> This product was just as i expected, good quality. I like that I can easily cut to the length I need.</li>
    <li> Good product, my only complaint is that GiGi must cut their large rolls of muslin at an angle because the stuff frays like crazy on the edges.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very good product.. I have used it 5 years ago and I in any zone for waxing .</li>
    <li> glad these aren&#x27;t precut so you can use as little as you want (which is better actually with grip) I still have this roll quite stocked. good for summer, will last you quite awhile!</li>
    <li> Nothing special but great price and tons of product. Easy to use.  You need to cut to fit the area you are working but worth the money</li>
    <li> Great product I would recommend it to anyone! I really enjoyed what I received. Merry Christmas to all and a Happy New Year</li>
    <li> We used the Sally Hansen \\&quot;all over\\&quot; wax kit on my legs and didn&#x27;t have enough of their included papers.  For the next waxing, we had GIGI&#x27;s Natural Muslin Roll on hand.  My dear and wonderful husband loved working with these (he&#x27;s my waxer!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being able to adapt the length is a great option.&lt;br /&gt;Some wax did seep through, creating a bit more of a sticky effect--not a deal-breaker in the least.&lt;br /&gt;Minimal shedding of the muslin.&lt;br /&gt;Best part:  He estimated that he&#x27;s got 4-5 waxings with this roll.</li>
    <li> I have ordered the same product 2 times so far - the last order I received was the best. The product is great and does not leave anything on the skin. Highly recommended. Price is great and shipping is very fast.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I starting doing DIY sugaring instead of buying wax kits every two weeks.  This pack is probably too much for me and these do shed a bit but I like using them plus I will save a lot of money so I will deal with the cleanup process from me cutting the strips.</li>
    <li> I am new to self waxing and I was told by a pro that I needed to purchase hard wax. I assumed (I know, my bad) that I would need a muslin roll as well. So when I received my shipment, I read on the roll that it was for soft waxes:( wish they would have mentioned this information on the description:/</li>
    <li> Have used this a few times now and it works perfect, and it was bigger than I thought it would be.  I would absolutely recommend to people.</li>
    <li> I like having the roll so I can cut exactly the size I need depending on what area I&#x27;m waxing, but the threads come loose and stick to the wax.  It&#x27;s thinner materal than the Gigi pre-cut strips that I&#x27;ve purchased before so the wax seeps through and makes my fingers sticky, I solve that by layering a second strip on top of the one I&#x27;m  going to pull. All said, it does pull the hair up well.</li>
    <li> It works great but the little shreds that come off get everywhere. They were a hassle to clean and I had to use a lint roller to get them off of my clothes. I probably won&#x27;t use these again.</li>
    <li> Works great and last a long time.  Sometimes strings will come lose on the edges of the strips, but that doesn&#x27;t stop the effectiveness of this product.</li>
    <li> Bet item to use when waxing and very durable . Was a great price for the amt you recieve</li>
    <li> Good quality.  I cut in half and then to size that I needed for different parts of the body</li>
    <li> Awesome... A huge roll for a decent price!</li>
    <li> It seems easier to just peel the Gigi wax itself. Doesn&#x27;t seem to stick on tightly enough, or maybe I&#x27;m just doing it wrong.</li>
    <li> I got this to go along with my Gigi wax kit. It worked perfectly. It sticks to the wax and has grip for pulling the wax up.</li>
    <li> very economical, you can reapply it few times, it does not leave residue; i&#x27;ve been using it for years, highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> The roll is so big that it will last a long time, but it&#x27;s thin and the wax will bleed through. I&#x27;ve never tried any other type, so I don&#x27;t have one I could compare it to or offer a better alternative.</li>
    <li> I will be using this roll for the rest of my life, it&#x27;s huge!!</li>
    <li> It is a good size roll. It is as shown.</li>
    <li> I like the roll because I cut it to size really easily. It takes about a half a roll for me to do both full legs.</li>
    <li> i liked these strips, sooooo much cheaper than getting the pre-cut ones. they are really good, and cheap. i highly recommend these</li>
    <li> Like that you can cut to the size you need. Much less expensive than the pre-cut strips.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great value for quantity, but is not the muslin I am used to for waxing. This is more fabric-y, than the slightly textured wax strips I am used to using. Sometimes, I don&#x27;t feel as though the wax sticks as well to it. I am still learning, but I probably won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I am aware of the brand and the reviews did warn me that it seemed like the company GiGi was getting cheaper. This was SO thin the wax would soak through even before you were ready to rip. I got wax all over my hands! It shed the threads too. Terrible. I&#x27;ve since gone to woven cotton/canvas.</li>
    <li> What I expected:) the roll is big.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t used It yet. I need to cut it into peaces first.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> Just what the description states. This roll will last you a good while. Reliable shipping. Its always better to buy the roll instead of the strips and cost effective too</li>
