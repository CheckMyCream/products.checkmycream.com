### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I have been buying cosplay wigs for over two years now and it is one of the best ones I have ever bought.</li>
      <li>I LOVE IT!!!</li>
      <li>But it held together beautifully</li>
      <li>The color is great too-</li>
      <li>I was happy with the look of it.</li>
      <li>but it was great.</li>
      <li>For the price, this is really a great wig.</li>
      <li>The color is great and the cut is good as well.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
      <li>I really love the way it looks!</li>
      <li>, it fits great, and it&#x27;s comfortable to wear.  </li>
      <li>which was nice.</li>
      <li>It also tangled very easily.</li>
      <li>Great product, exactly as pictured.</li>
      <li>Good quality, arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a shame because I would like to wear it more often.</li>
      <li>Ordered the white for a Ghost Costume and it was awesome.</li>
      <li>Very happy with purchase and was totally worth the extra shipping to get it in 3-5 days</li>
      <li>The wig tangles extremely easily.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice wig and it looked exactly like I thought it would.</li>
      <li>It looks nice until it ends up tangling, and the color is really pretty.</li>
      <li>and I was worried about the fit</li>
      <li>The wig is very long and would be great for a cosplay or anime costume.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t look super cheap--the hair looks more real than some super cheap party wigs.</li>
      <li>This was full, soft, not shiny, and amazing.</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t much though, so I&#x27;m okay with it.</li>
      <li>For an 11 dollar wig I guess its not bad.</li>
      <li>Not bad for a costume wig.</li>
      <li>For some reason the wig doesn&#x27;t fit just right.</li>
      <li>I got the wig in the blonde color for a Halloween costume and its awesome- especially for the price!</li>
      <li>Very pretty and not as shiny as I thought it would be.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s thick, the color is beautiful, and it is CHEAP.</li>
      <li>It is very thinthough, but I use it for my fem!Noiz cosplay and i wear a hat over it and it looks fine</li>
      <li>The product came about a week earlier than expected, which was great!</li>
      <li>Fun wig.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s simply confusing because all the other wigs I have purchased from this lovely store have fit perfectly.</li>
      <li>It looks nicer, is more realistic, and much cheaper than any wig I could have bought in a Halloween store.</li>
      <li>The wig was very full and soft.</li>
      <li>The only thing I would say is an issue is the netting being somewhat visible in the back, but as long as I rearrange the hair right, it&#x27;s fine :D</li>
      <li>other than that is is nice and full.</li>
      <li>a darker blonde than most of the wigs in this range I&#x27;ve been looking at, and since I&#x27;ve got naturally darker hair, I didn&#x27;t want a super light wig.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s soft, it doesn&#x27;t tangle easily,</li>
      <li>Nice quality, came much sooner than expect, almost three weeks earlier!  </li>
      <li>The bangs were at a good length and I like the little bit of curl it has to the hair.</li>
      <li>I ordered this for a bachelorette party and it is the first wig I have ever purchase.</li>
      <li>I will be gladly returning to this company in the future.</li>
      <li>I still like it and hope to use it for a cosplay or normal wear in the future. :)</li>
      <li>it isnt very shiny like you&#x27;d expect.</li>
      <li>The netting isn&#x27;t as thick as most wigs so it doesn&#x27;t look super poofy while wearing it.</li>
      <li>The blonde color is a slightly more orange than blonde, so keep that in mind.</li>
      <li>so with me having dark brown hair its really easy to spot under the wig.</li>
      <li>so I suggest that if your looking for a high quality wig that you spend a little extra for better quality.</li>
      <li>I ordered a blonde wig and what I got had a lot of orange in it, which made it look even more odd.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s what you pay for, it ends up being a bit on the thinner side, so the netting is semi-easy to see in the back if you wear the wig with the hair in certain ways.</li>
      <li>I ran a detangling brush through it and was surprised by the lack of shedding.</li>
      <li>It has plenty of hair, but it does not look remotely natural.</li>
      <li>so it is obvious that it&#x27;s a wig and not real hair, but by adding some slight roots to the top with some dark eye shadow, it looks much more realistic.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a high end wig, obviously, but it&#x27;s full.</li>
      <li>This could be styles/cut, but with all of the other negatives it is not even worth it.</li>
      <li>This wig obviously isn&#x27;t made to be put into a high ponytail.</li>
      <li>It did arrive about a week early and it came with a free black wig cap (even though black would not be my color of choice.)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little thin on top, and the hair is very slippery</li>
      <li>Not very authentic looking, but that wasnt really the point of why I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>

<li> The wig is somewhat thin but yet full enough to look presentable.</li>
<li> It is extremely platinum blonde, not yellow like the photo.</li>
<li> I needed something long so it could be styled.  </li>
<li> The wig is very nice, the only problem is the mesh q is in several parts, the worst is in the front.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t wear the wig for very long without a headache.</li>
<li> So for most people I don&#x27;t think it will be as bad.</li>
<li> then I have to carefully place the bangs to hide my hairline in front.</li>
<li> It shipped faster than expected</li>
<li> Its thinner than other wigs I&#x27;ve bought in the past, but I don&#x27;t have any problem with my natural dark hair showing through, and there&#x27;s still plenty of hair to work with.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong though, its definitely still blonde!</li>
<li> Whatever the hair is made out of is very strange and does not look/feel like hair in the least.</li>
<li> It was a little longer</li>
<li> I do have a few problems with it though.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> The hair is nice and silky and not as shiny and awful as all the Halloween store wigs you see.</li>
<li> The wig was as pictured but, it was missing some wefts in the bangs, you could see the cap... but</li>
<li> why four stars?&lt;br /&gt;The wig cap is small.</li>
<li> Usually wigs give me a headache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Finally, the cut of the wig was awful with the bags hanging down in front of the face.</li>
<li> but it is of poor quality.</li>
<li> The wefts are thin  </li>
<li> This looked so bad I ended up ordering another wig and let my niece play with this one.</li>
<li> I have insane amounts of hair, though.</li>

    <li> Not bad for a costume wig. Doesn&#x27;t look super cheap--the hair looks more real than some super cheap party wigs.</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT!!! It&#x27;s soft, it doesn&#x27;t tangle easily, it&#x27;s thick, the color is beautiful, and it is CHEAP. The bangs were at a good length and I like the little bit of curl it has to the hair. It was a little longer then I thought it was going to be, which is actually good.&lt;br /&gt;So why four stars?&lt;br /&gt;The wig cap is small. I can&#x27;t wear the wig for very long without a headache. It&#x27;s a shame because I would like to wear it more often. I have insane amounts of hair, though.

    <li> The product came about a week earlier than expected, which was great! However, once I opened it, some of the hairs fell out. It wasn&#x27;t much though, so I&#x27;m okay with it. I ran a detangling brush through it and was surprised by the lack of shedding. The wig is somewhat thin but yet full enough to look presentable.

    <li> Great product, exactly as pictured. The blonde color is a slightly more orange than blonde, so keep that in mind. The wig is very long and would be great for a cosplay or anime costume. I would recommend the expedited shipping as I received the wig in about two days!</li>
    <li> For some reason the wig doesn&#x27;t fit just right. It&#x27;s simply confusing because all the other wigs I have purchased from this lovely store have fit perfectly. I still like it and hope to use it for a cosplay or normal wear in the future. :)</li>
    <li> Ordered the white for a Ghost Costume and it was awesome. I have purchased 20+ wigs for my various Halloween parties and Halloween projects. This was full, soft, not shiny, and amazing. I seem to have a bigger head and I was worried about the fit but it was great. I will be gladly returning to this company in the future. It took about 3 weeks to arrive.</li>
    <li> I ordered this wig in blonde for a Halloween costume.  I needed something long so it could be styled.  It&#x27;s a little thin on top, and the hair is very slippery: we had to coat it with hairspray to hold a style.  But it held together beautifully, it fits great, and it&#x27;s comfortable to wear.  Usually wigs give me a headache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wig arrived on time, about a week before the end of the delivery time frame we were given.  It looks nicer, is more realistic, and much cheaper than any wig I could have bought in a Halloween store.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for a bachelorette party and it is the first wig I have ever purchase. It has plenty of hair, but it does not look remotely natural. Whatever the hair is made out of is very strange and does not look/feel like hair in the least. It also tangled very easily. I ordered a blonde wig and what I got had a lot of orange in it, which made it look even more odd. Finally, the cut of the wig was awful with the bags hanging down in front of the face.

    <li> The wig is very nice, the only problem is the mesh q is in several parts, the worst is in the front.&lt;br /&gt;I like it but it is of poor quality.</li>
    <li> For an 11 dollar wig I guess its not bad. I do have a few problems with it though.&lt;br /&gt;I personally bought the Blonde wig for a Fionna the human cosplay and I was kinda upset when it came in. The wefts are thin  so with me having dark brown hair its really easy to spot under the wig. The wig tangles extremely easily. I wouldn&#x27;t take it out of the package unless you have a can of Motions spray nearby. The mesh of the wig does not encompass all of my hair line so the bottom of my hairline sticks out unless I pull the wig back then I have to carefully place the bangs to hide my hairline in front. It did arrive about a week early and it came with a free black wig cap (even though black would not be my color of choice.) All in all I got what I paid. An 11 dollar wig is going to be an 11 dollar wig so I suggest that if your looking for a high quality wig that you spend a little extra for better quality.</li>
    <li> I got the wig in the blonde color for a Halloween costume and its awesome- especially for the price! Its thinner than other wigs I&#x27;ve bought in the past, but I don&#x27;t have any problem with my natural dark hair showing through, and there&#x27;s still plenty of hair to work with. The color is great too- a darker blonde than most of the wigs in this range I&#x27;ve been looking at, and since I&#x27;ve got naturally darker hair, I didn&#x27;t want a super light wig. Don&#x27;t get me wrong though, its definitely still blonde! The hair is nice and silky and not as shiny and awful as all the Halloween store wigs you see. Very happy with purchase and was totally worth the extra shipping to get it in 3-5 days</li>
    <li> Good quality, arrived quickly. Would order again.</li>
    <li> Ordered this for a costume, it looks like the picture. Very pretty and not as shiny as I thought it would be.</li>
