<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Got 2oz bottle and the smell is great. Very refresh and cool off your face</li>
    <li> The smell of the rose and the quality of the product is just amazing ! I highly recommend it  ! :)</li>
    <li> perfect rose water. been spritzing it on throughout the day, and my skin is glowing! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Very nice product and packaging.</li>
    <li> Great product!! I won&#x27;t use a different toner!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. It&#x27;s very light and refreshing, and I noticed a decrease in redness in my skin within a few days. I will continue to use this toner as long as it is available.</li>
    <li> I first heard of rose water as a skincare indulgence on a high school trip to the Renaissance Faire. Our “Fair Maiden” chaperones took us to shops where we learned about the distillation process, the purity of rose water and its use by women in high societies. It is a product with many beauty benefits that has been used since ancient times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary rose water toner for review purposes. Teddie Organics Rose Water Toner works great for daily use on my skin as a refresher or to treat mild acne. If I have a breakout, I target treat the area with a rose water toner solution. Rose water toner is an excellent remedy for acne because it contains antiseptic and antimicrobial properties. I have sensitive skin and Teddie Organics Rose Water Toner is gentle enough to use every day. It also smells fantastic. It is organic and unrefined rose water, but smells aromatic and reminds me of a blooming rose garden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides using it to spot treat acne, I love using toner to minimize pores and fine lines. I see a noticeable difference after using toner in the morning and night. My face feels tighter and noticeably better after regular use of a rose water toner in my skincare.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d give this 10 stars.  This organic rose water is so refreshing and pure it instantly lighten up my face and mood.  I have oily skin and works great to remove excess oil and hydrates at the same time.  I use this daily as a toner and spray on my pillows at night. Perfect for summer days to spray on your face for a quick freshness and glow.  Buying another one for my sister.  Love the product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to order a pure rosewater hydrosol that is actually 100 percent rosewater vs  having an oil or rosewater combo. This rosewater delivers exactly as promised-it has a subtle but distinct smell that&#x27;s refreshing and it&#x27;s very soothing sprayed on the skin-i had a minor forehead breakout that cleared faster after using a few spritzes. Love the glass bottle and it arrived intact and fast. So far very pleased with this brand-a great smelling, genuine rose water that I would reorder again</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful rose water,  smells soft and it feels so good on my skin.  Love it...a gift from the gods.</li>
    <li> This is a gorgeous product.  It is so fresh and pure.  I&#x27;ve tried a number of rose waters because I love it as a toner, and i enjoy the delicacy of the fragrance - it&#x27;s very calming.  This Teddie rose water is the best I&#x27;ve had.  And I have an organic rose garden...!</li>
    <li> I just love the smell and feel of this toner as I spray it on my face and neck.  It is so refreshing!!  They have a loyal customer forever.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m delighted with my purchase, I&#x27;ve been using it for only three days as part of my night time routine and my skin looks super nice and soft the next morning. I don&#x27;t like wearing makeup (except for my eyelashes and a clear lip balm), is better for me to nourish and pamper my skin, this Rose Water is a great addition to my collection. Nobody has sent this to me, I paid for it, and I don&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I love this ORGANIC rose water it&#x27;s perfect</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing and refreshing! This company takes care of you and truly values there customers!!</li>
    <li> Great as a refresher and i sometimes soak a cotton ball with it and use it as an astringent.</li>
    <li> Love this as a toner and facial mist. Smells great, is very gentle and leaves my skin super soft. I don&#x27;t know that I could ever go back to a regular toner after this. This is just so much more gentle on my skin. Great product!</li>
    <li> Really good product. It instantly calms and soothes my skin.</li>
    <li> I love the way my skin feels moments after I spray this on my face, sooo soft! I use it at night before going to bed and again in the morning after I get out of the shower. The packaging is beautiful and it smells great. I have really sensitive skin, but have had no adverse reactions to this product. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Love this. No complaints,  worth it than sisley or shiseido.&lt;br /&gt;Love you teddi</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Fantastic product!!!! I love this Rosewater!! It&#x27;s a great price for the quality you get and I just love the company. They really care about the customer. I will definitely be buying from them again and would highly recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price. I will definitely be a repeat customer</li>
    <li> I love it, and use it only on my skin after each shower. It softens and revitalizes my skin, while giving my skin a youthful, healthy looking and feeling.</li>
    <li> Teddie Organics only delivers the best quality. I am obsessed with their rose water. I spritz myself with it every morning and night... I keep an extra bottle on my night stand or a refreshing wake up spritz!</li>
    <li> Arrived safely packed and quick! The product itself is well made and has been amazing for my face. I heard of this brand through Amazon and will now look at the rest of the product line since the rose water has been so refreshing and pure! Thank you and highly recommended</li>
    <li> I am truly obsessed with Rose Water. Rose Water is one of those items that has a wide variety of uses. From being a good cleanser, as well as working to balance the Ph levels as well as acts as an anti-inflammatory as well as can aid dry skin in moisturizing. This is a pure form of rose water, which truly makes it a great product to have in your skincare arsenal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is pure heaven. I just discovered rose water in the past four months, and have already used up a whole bottle already, it&#x27;s one of very few &amp;#34;empties&amp;#34; I have. I use rose water toner more than any other skincare product I own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing about this particular product, my spray doesn&#x27;t spray a nice just, but more of a narrow stream, it&#x27;s not at big of an issue though, I just use it on a cotton ball and then apply.&lt;br /&gt;* Sample Provided for Testing &amp; Review</li>
    <li> So far so good! It&#x27;s only been a few days since I started using the product, but it seems to be keeping my skin moisturized and it smells good!</li>
    <li> I love this rose water!  I can not compare it with other brands since this is my first time using rose water, but I am definitely pleased with this brand and will be a repeat customer.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I really love this product. I use it as a facial toner. It&#x27;s very light and smells great. It hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts on my face. I&#x27;ve only been using it for two weeks but I want to keep it apart of my beauty routine. I also wasn&#x27;t sure if I would prefer the spray nozzle or using a Colton ball but I really love that it has a spray nozzle because I just spray and go.</li>
    <li> I like rose waters in general, and this one does not disappoint. It has a lighter fragrance to it, so it isn&#x27;t overpowering. The customer service is also outstanding; I had a question on another issue and they were prompt and very courteous. Definitely give it a try!</li>
    <li> Great product and the maker/seller corrected a minor issue immediately without compromising quality.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product I recently started adding to my DIY vitamin C serum.  Will most certainly order again. Thank you for the outstanding service!</li>
    <li> Very refreshing. Wish the spray were more like a mist because I have to spray it on my hand then pat it on my face since the spray is too strong and not of the water will fall. Other than that it&#x27;s great! I live in dry weather and have dry skin so I want to use this all the time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been hearing wonderful things about rose water for quite some time so I was excited to try this. I cannot believe how much I am in love with this product. I opted for the 4oz bottle and am using it as a spray. It has helped clear up some adult acne I have. I am using this as a toner after I shower and can&#x27;t get over how amazing the smell is. My face doesn&#x27;t seem so inflamed from the acne, and it also is less oily than it was before I starting using this.&lt;br /&gt;In addition to using it on my face I have been spraying it on my arms and neck to cool down and just to smell it. I truely enjoy the scent so much that I&#x27;m spraying this several times a day. It&#x27;s an added plus that this is USDA approved organic. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product and will, without a doubt, purchase this for my daughter and mother. This product will be part of my beauty routine for the foreseeable future. TWO BIG THUMBS UP!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
    <li> Love Teddie Organics Rose Water Toner!! The best toner I&#x27;ve tried so far!! It leaves my face feeling clean and hydrated. I&#x27;ve also applied it to badly sunburned skin. It immediately calmed my daughter&#x27;s &amp;#34;angry&amp;#34; skin and the redness lightened. Wonderful product!</li>
    <li> Rose Water Toner smells wonderful and feels refreshing and hydrating!  I received a bottle with a pump dispenser (not spray) and customer service was prompt and courteous and took care of my issue.  They reached out to me even before i received the product.  I will order this product again.</li>
    <li> Item was wrapped very well and packaged perfectly. Have only been using a few days but love it already. The smell is calm and not overwhelming,  I also like the organic rose smell! My skin feels toned literally after spritzing! It&#x27;s been 100+ here and the light mist feels great! I have angry blemish prime oily skin which is really angry right now and the toner seems to calm it dramatically. I spray on a lot before bed and wake up with redness reduced dramatically and bumps are visibly smaller. My pores seem to look smaller too! Great price for the 4 oz size! Will definitely be buying more :)</li>
    <li> The rose water is great but bottle is cheap and never sprayed.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s refreshing and I love the scent.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Let me first say that although I have a slight Amazon addiction, this is the first review I have ever written. I understand that Teddie Organics is a small business and they are local to me, so I&#x27;m taking the time to review this product. It is wonderful. I use it to spritz on my face after showering to add moisture and hopefully help with wrinkles. I recently had a baby and my skin was feeling dry due to all the hormonal changes. This rose water has helped hugely! I spritz it on my face, it smells great and quickly dries without any alcohol or anything else except rose water! My skin feels better, and has a slight rosy glow that lasts from morning until evening when I wash my face again. I&#x27;ve also been using it on rough bumpy skin on my arms and legs and seen improvement there too. I will be buying this again.&lt;br /&gt;As an added plus, the essence of roses is supposed to have one of the highest vibrations, which explains it&#x27;s healing (wrinkle fighting) properties. It is also said to enhance your mood. Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Love it! Very refreshing!</li>
    <li> I love this toner.  I use  it daily, and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  I will purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Great product, carefully packed. Thanks.</li>
    <li> The spray doesn&#x27;t work well. It&#x27;s hard to press. It doesn&#x27;t come out as mist. Better use it with cotton pad. The smell is good.</li>
    <li> I love it! It&#x27;s very refreshing and the smell is great! It&#x27;s wonderful on hot days to spritz a little on your face and neck to give you a quick cool down. And the smell of rose petals is an added bonus. I&#x27;ve been using it everyday for about a week and my skin already feels more soft and hydrated. I&#x27;ve been sharing it with others and they all seem to love it too! I&#x27;ll def. be buying more!!</li>
    <li> I am going as organic as possible which not only includes what I put in my body but on it as well.  Rose water is a great skin toner/refresher and I love this one.  Just spritz on your face and wipe of before bed to get rid of makeup and spray on after washing have in the morning before moisturizing!</li>
    <li> Love the Rose Flower Water! I use it throughout the day. Wonderful for freshening up. The sellers are really nice people to work with.</li>
    <li> This gives my skin a wonderful finish after applying makeup. A spritz here and again throughout the day keeps my skin &amp;#34;happy&amp;#34; and looking good!! Tried it on a whim but will continue to use it!!</li>
    <li> Great as toner and face freshner</li>
    <li> I was hoping when I purchased the organic rose water that the smell would be subtle and not overpowering, it&#x27;s PERFECT and I love the spray. Teddie Organics also has great communication.  I will be buying this again and I&#x27;m going to see what else they have to offer.</li>
    <li> Awesome customer service and I an very happy with the quality of the rose water. I use it as a cleanser fir my face neck and chest. I use argon oil with it to remove my makeup at night and just the rose water in the morning.  I use it as eye drops and a tsp in a couple of cups of water as a rinse on my hair to condition it sometimes. :)</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough good things about this product. I use this Rose Water Toner as well as their Rosehip oil on my face, and my skin has never looked better. I&#x27;ve used countless high end expensive dermatologist and department store products, and these are honestly better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The owners are also incredibly nice and helpful. The sprayer on mine stopped working, and they apologized and sent out a replacement asap! Great company and great products. I&#x27;m completely impressed!</li>
    <li> This rose water smells very lovely and feels so refreshing on my face. I&#x27;m glad to have found a rose water that is pure organic rose water compared to many other brands with added chemicals.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It&#x27;s a great facial toner/hydrator plus more.  One unexpected benefit is the way it soothed/calmed an inflamed patch of itchy skin on my arm.  This spot has been an ongoing problem off and on for years that I have found no immediate relief for until now.  I am more than happy with the fresh scent and benefits of this all natural rose water spritzer. Due to a mistake by their supplier, my 4oz. spray bottle came without the spray cap.  However, customer service was excellent and they quickly sent me the 2oz. travel bottle with the sprayer intact to use and then refill with my 4oz. bottle.  Awesome!</li>
    <li> Love, Love Love Teddie Organics Rose Water!! This was my first purchase and I will be back for more.</li>
    <li> It smells and feels fabulous. Great product!</li>
    <li> Great I really like it.</li>
    <li> I just received the product, but so far I can tell it is good quality and 100% pure. Not only that, but great customer service from the seller. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had oily, acne-prone skin since I was a teenager and have tried every product on the market with little success. I decided to order this toner as a supplement to my current routine. I&#x27;ve only been using the rose water toner for a week, but my skin is clear for the first time in 10+ years. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Great product and great customer service. This is the first time I&#x27;ve used rose water and I am in love. It calms irritated skin and I&#x27;ve been using it on my foundation brush and Beauty Blender too. Teddie Organics will now be the only place I shop for organic products.</li>
    <li> I am thrilled with this product. I&#x27;m using it as a toner and a mist to set my makeup. The sprayer was defective and the seller immediately sent out another bottle with correct mister spray at no charge. This will definitely be a staple in my makeup.</li>
    <li> I have owned this product for several weeks. WOW!!!!!!!!!!  It smells amazing and it&#x27;s so refreshing on your face. I am getting towards that age and hot flashes are occurring. This cools you off and calms you down. I keep my bottle in the frig so it&#x27;s nice and cool when it is sprayed on my face.</li>
    <li> I have been using Teddie Organics ORGANIC 100% Pure distilled Rose Water only for a couple of days and I really like it.  The complexion of my skin looks already better and I also like the smell.  The item arrived in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> After being introduced to the benefits of rose water, I really wanted to incorporate into part of my daily skin routine. However, I was having a hard time finding a good quality and brand of rose water. I stumbled across Teddie Organics in my search and after reading about the company and the numerous glowing reviews, I decided to purchase from them. Their customer service is wonderful! They follow up with you after each order to make sure that your product arrived okay and really encourage you to contact them with any problems. I love the product and its beautiful glass bottling.</li>
    <li> This is an absolutely beautiful product and Teddie Organics provides unusually great customer service. My pores are pretty much invisible after just a week of using it. I&#x27;m going to continue buying it as part of my natural skincare regime.</li>
    <li> I have been using Teddie Organic Rose Water for 2 weeks and can see and feel the improvement in my &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; skin. I have additionally spitzed my face several times throughout the day to cool off during the summer heat. I am very happy with this product - I plan to continue using!</li>
    <li> Hello I purchased the Teddie Organics Rose Water over a week ago and Love it!,  The scent is Beautiful very earthy like a true  rose.  I have tried others and the scent is fake to sweet!  Not only is the scent wonderful and I like the idea of it being organic it is very soothing and very hydrating I take it on my 3 mile walks and spritz it on for a pick me up also the aromatherapy really helps to keep going😌Also right before bedtime it&#x27;s wonderful!  After I wash up I spray it on a cotton pad to wipe on my face and it picks up the last traces of what the cleaning did not get and leaves my skin feeling soft and wonderful! I would highly recommend this product‼️. One more thing the CS has been Great! The family that owns this small business follows up with you to make sure you are happy with their product and I like very much supporting small business that takes great pride in what they sell♥️</li>
    <li> Really calms my sensitive/easily inflamed skin - really noticed a difference in the softness! Rarely write reviews, but thought this might help someone turn from skeptic to purchaser ;)</li>
    <li> I use it for my everyday face toner after I cleaned my face. It doesn&#x27;t make your face dry, which I like about it. And it also has an awesome natural rosy smell</li>
    <li> Excellent product! I have super sensitive skin and had read about the benefits of rose water.  I knew I wanted pure rose water,no fillers, no junk!  After searching my local Ulta, with no luck, I took the good ol&#x27; internet. That&#x27;s how I found Tedddy Organics and I love it!  It leaves my skin soft and moisturized.  I also mix it with rhassoul clay for a cleasning mask that has almost rid me of my adult acne.&lt;br /&gt;I just got it and I&#x27;m going to have to buy more soon because my friends and family all want to try my cleansing mask.</li>
    <li> I have been using the product about two weeks consistently, and I enjoy the fresh feeling on my skin.</li>
    <li> I love this product and I love this company! In this world of fast and anonymous I was surprised that within a day of making my order I received an e-mail from the company thanking me, giving me an expected shipping time frame, encouraging me to check the product when it arrives, and giving me direct contact to the company should there be any problems. Too be fair...there were no problems, the product arrived within days, it was perfect, no leaks, no issues, and the quality is fantastic...so I did not need to make use of the customer service, but I did write back to say thank you and heard back within an hour. Top notch service! Had there been an issue I trust it would have been resolved immediately and with kindness and concern. I love the rose water, I have used rose water before and I like the results, what will keep me shopping at Teddie Organics for my rose water is first, the quality - I take great care with what I put on my skin - I trust that Teddie Organics rose water is pure, it&#x27;s chemical free, it&#x27;s not tampered with, and it works! Second,  customer service, I feel loyal already and this is my first purchase. Finally, the sprayer on the bottle - it sprays in a wide even mist, products I have used before have misted in areas so you end up having to use more to get the coverage you want. I love this product, I will recommend to family and friends, I will shop here again.</li>
    <li> Wonderful, clean product. Such a pleasure to use, only surpassed by the excellent customer service. Only positive things to say about this small family business.</li>
    <li> Teddie Organics Rose Water and Rose seed Oil are magical products.  After only a few days  using both products my face seemed to glow, and&lt;br /&gt;mature acne spots were less visible.  Its been a little over a week since I stared using both products and I am so o o o pleased.  After cleaning my face I use the toner &amp; then the Rose seed oil on my face.  The results are amazing.... the absolute best product I&#x27;ve ever encountered.  Wish I had known about this years ago.  I will buy again and again, and look for more organic rose products from this company.  Thanks so very much for your wonderful products.</li>
    <li> Very nice product.  I spray it on my hair as well as my face.  It makes my wavy hair soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I heard rose water is great for the skin and hair. I was nervous to order because I really can&#x27;t stand the smell of roses. Therefore I do not like the smell of this product. That is just a personal thing. Nothing to do with the product. After about 10-15 minutes I don&#x27;t seem to smell it anymore and have asked my husband if I smell like roses and he says no. Thank goodness for that!  I spray it on my face after washing it and it feels very nice. It feels like it tightens the skin without making it feel dry. The biggest reason I bought it is for my hair. I hope that it helps with the dryness  I get on the ends. Typical hair products are full of silicones and oils. I have a closet full of them. Even really pricey products like Kerastase.  I really like how this is working. I feel like it helps the health of my hair without weighing it down or drying it out. I have only been using for a few days but I am hopeful that I will continue to see a nice improvement with my hair and skin.  So far I would say I will repurchase.&lt;br /&gt;Btw, the emails I have received from the company after purchasing shows that they really care about your happiness in your purchase. I imagine if you had a problem with a broken bottle or something like that, they would take excellent care of you.</li>
    <li> I love this rose water, it smells great, and refreshing. I only wish it came in a bigger bottle because I use it a lot.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product! Love that it&#x27;s a ONE ingredient product- it seems like everyone else wants to put extra stuff in it. I&#x27;ve always loved rose water and tried several different ones. Very happy with it and will be re-ordering, for sure!</li>
    <li> This is my first time to use rose water on my skin and now I&#x27;m a believer--it&#x27;s the best product I&#x27;ve ever used on my skin to tame redness and even post peel inflammation.  It gives me a nice fresh glow without make up and doesn&#x27;t make my face oily. I like this specific brand of rose water because it is not diluted with other ingredients and is totally organic. Just love it so much, I ordered 2 more bottles.;)</li>
    <li> Great customer service and my skin has been clear and hydrated since using the product!  Update: After months of using this product, it is absolutely a permanent part of my skincare regimen. It is perfect in the summer to cool off as well as hydrate your skin and in the winter, it is a lightweight toner before I put on my lotion. My skin has stayed hydrated throughout the duration of using this product and I love it. Also, I definitely trust Teddie Organics quality. Amazing.</li>
    <li> Great product, great company.</li>
    <li> Love it.  So soothing.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few days now and so far so good. The smell is pleasant and smells just like a rose. Good size bottle and the shipment was fast. Great communication from the sender.</li>
    <li> Nice product and I liked it, but since then I&#x27;ve tried another brand which has become my favorite.</li>
    <li> Just received and started using.  Love the fragrance and how it makes my skin feel afterwards.</li>
    <li> I purchased the 4 Oz bottle which does not come with a spray top, it has a pump top, it just doesn&#x27;t spritz your face. Best to use a cotton round or ball to apply this product. It smells AMAZING, just like a fresh bouquet of roses. It&#x27;s very refreshing feeling on your face. Great toner, my face feels so hydrated. *sample provided for review*</li>
    <li> I love this product!! It&#x27;s great to use after cleaning my face, as well as when I just want a little refreshing mist on my face. It smells so pure, just like roses in a bottle :)</li>
    <li> This is a great product and I appreciate that its organic-especially important since it is a facial toner.  It has a nice delicate fragrance and I like using throughout the day.  The customer service for this company is fantastic.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. I&#x27;m hooked! I&#x27;m in my second bottle in two montjs</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for -- lovely rose water smell, no other ingredients, and attractive packaging as well.</li>
    <li> After Several uses it would not spray. It is like the pump got stuck.  The product itself is good but the pump is malfunctioning.  Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> This works great! I love the feeling it gives my face after I spray it. It&#x27;s so refreshing! And to make it even better, the owner contacted me after I received it, just to make sure I enjoyed it. I even asked him a few questions, and he responded (so it wasn&#x27;t an automated thing). I really enjoy this.</li>
    <li> Teddie organic rose water does not disappoint! I&#x27;m usually not a fan of floral scents but I really like the scent of this. It&#x27;s simple and seems so elegant. I have been spraying it on my face daily in the morning, at night, and throughout the day when I want to feel refreshed. The smell is inviting and relaxes my mood. My acne has cleared up a lot and the redness in my cheeks has greatly decreased. My pores look visibly smaller and I don&#x27;t notice any blackheads on my face. I&#x27;ve also noticed the little bumps I would get on my neck/chest area are gone. My skin looks and feels moisturized and visibly brighter. On top of the amazing results I have seen while using it on my face, I have even used it in my aromatherapy diffuser. The scent is so calming and helps you relax after a stressful day. I have a new outlook on rose scents thanks to Teddie Organics. I can&#x27;t believe I went so long without this stuff! *sample provided for testing and review*</li>
    <li> Love the rose water it is  helping to relieve my skin when irritated and leaves you feeling refreshed. I would definitely but this product again.</li>
    <li> I love this toner and my 10 year old begs to use it.  I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy the scent and the product, but not too crazy about the spray on the bottle.  I like to mist my face with the rose water throughout the day because it helps me feel fresh and it also keep my face hydrated, I bought this particular toner because it was in a spray bottle, but the spray shoots out the toner instead of spray/misting it.  I since then put it in another bottle that does have a mister on it, and I love it so far!  I would have given it 5 stars if it wasn&#x27;t for the spraying issue.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Moisturizers, tones, and refreshes. Great customer service and follow-up from the company owners. The scent is also very nice and light.</li>
    <li> I do like it, but the smell is not as &amp;#34;rosey&amp;#34; as I would have like.  Smells very strong.</li>
    <li> Love this andI will definitely purchase again. First time I have ever used rose water, but always read about all of the benefits. I&#x27;m so happy that I chose Teddie Organics Rose Water as my first try. It is really great. -Ashley</li>
    <li> Teddie organic rose water feels so soothing to my over sensitive (eczema prone) skin and it adds a healthy glow to my 50 year old face.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product but the sprayer on the 4 oz bottles needs to be improved. I have purchased 2 bottles and have had issues with both. I used a sprayer from a bottle I had from another product. Otherwise&lt;br /&gt;I love your rose water. Great for sensitive, acne prone, combination skin. No residue, light scent, perfect!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I&#x27;ve been using it daily to freshen up and energize my face. My skin looks and feels amazing. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> After shaving, I use an alum block to help reduce redness and inflammation, but still end up with red dots if I try to get a really close shave. I added this to my routine after the alum block (but before aftershave balm), and now no longer get the red dots. Thought I&#x27;d try using rose water since it was use post-shave in the shave I got at one of The Art of Shaving stores, which was the closest shave I ever had and I didn&#x27;t end up with any redness or dots. So it seems that there is something to rose water. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Just used it for the first time...Leaves no weird residue. Feels great on my skin and smells lovely! Will be back to comment on its effectiveness.</li>
    <li> We really like Teddy Organics Rose Water Facial Toner.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this rosewater for about a week. Bought the rosewater because I have rosacea. I&#x27;m noticing it does reduce the redness from the rosacea, but probably haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see all of its benefits. Will update this review after longer use of product.</li>
    <li> Started using it and after a week I could see and feel the difference in my skin, soft and radiant! the only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the atomizer gets stuck sometimes if I don&#x27;t wipe it clean after I use it, but other than that I love this product and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use anything else as a toner.</li>
    <li> Did not like the smell. Did not see the effect. Want my money back.</li>
    <li> Great product great seller</li>
    <li> Received this from my mother as a gift--now my whole family loves Teddie Organics! I am a teenager with very angry, sensitive skin that becomes highly irritated and inflamed with very little or even no provocation.  Lately I have been washing my face with only warm water, which has improved it&#x27;s constitution, but I still have blackheads and occasional white heads (usually about 3 or 4 on my face at a time).  Before I got this, I started using a different rose water solution from Jane Iredale.  I really liked it and had planned on ordering more, but after this I will never go back!!!!  The pure stuff worked WONDERS.  Within two days, my skin is smoother, my pores are tighter, and my acne and redness has gone down so much!  No longer does my face feel irritated, painful, or itchy.  This even got rid of a stubborn spot of eczema on my neck, something even prescription topical steroids hadn&#x27;t fixed.  I AM HOOKED.  I am about to head off to college in a few weeks and will be ordering another bottle ahead of time so I won&#x27;t have to spend even a minute  without it.  Is it pricey?  Yes, it pains me to shell out so much for a single product.  But when that product eliminates my need for any other facial product?  SO WORTH IT.</li>
    <li> Great Product and very prompt delivery!</li>
    <li> I ordered this rose water at my friend&#x27;s recommendation and am happy I did!  I especially like the sprayer feature. I have been using it for about a week now and just love it. My face and neck feel more hydrated and softer.  Fast shipping and great customer service. I am so happy to have found this product!</li>
    <li> Outstanding product. Felt the difference in my skin almost from the first use. It&#x27;s softer, brighter and it stays that way throughout the day. Teddies Oeganics appears to be genuinely interested in their customers&#x27; opinions and needs. I will gladly purchase from them again.</li>
    <li> The company provides great quality organic rose water. Customer service is great. Will order again when I run out.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves it! Her skin looks and feels more hydrated and its 100% all natural.</li>
    <li> I have used pure rose water for my face for years and fine that this particular brand is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;This is the first time I have purchased from Teddie but it will not be my last.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve finally found an item I can use after cleansing that wipes away any left over debris and moisturizes at the same time. Leaves you feeling fresh and clean with no foul ingredients. Teddie organics delivered this product in a timely fashion, with great packaging and an amount of product worth every penny. Will definitely order again</li>
    <li> Very nice product. It was shipped fast and came in good condition. Extacly as i expected.</li>
    <li> A really wonderful product that smells incredible! I just wish it sprayed as more of a mist so you could more easily use it on your face.</li>
    <li> Very fast delivery , good product, smells nice and feels good on my skin ! Will order again !</li>
    <li> Love the product itself, the rose water works great on my sensitive skin. The only thing I do not like, is the bottle that I got. The top does not come out as a spray like the one shown (which is one of the reasons why I chose this product over others). Mine has one hole that comes out as a stream which makes it hard to apply.</li>
    <li> I love it! It smells very natural and gently like roses - I spray it on in the mornings and/or use it for cleaning my face in the evenings. The smell goes away fast, perfect!&lt;br /&gt;And to know that its organic feels good, I will use it for my little girl, too!&lt;br /&gt;Its a little pricier than others but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Amazing product--so refreshing.  Also, fantastic customer service.  I would not hesitate to recommend and will be repurchasing as soon as I get through my first bottle.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, wonderful Customer service</li>
    <li> Feels good on my face, but something about the smell that I&#x27;m not too thrilled about. My mom on the other hand loves it, so maybe it&#x27;s just me.  Having said that, the seller Teddie Organics have the best customer service. They are amazing and respond to your concerns immediately and take action right away. So thank you for that Teddie Organics, 5 stars on customer service.</li>
    <li> Really like this... after a work out, before bed, anytime... so refreshing and dewy. Highly recommend... good for your skin!</li>
    <li> One word: AMAZING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have all sorts of allergies so I hesitated on trying rose water.  However, the reviews were great so I gave it a chance.. and boy, I am happy I did!  Not only is it refreshing and smells wonderful, I noticed an improvement on my skin.  I have combination skin and menstrual break outs.  Now, my skin is glowing.  When I ran out, I was given a Japanese brand of rose water and I tried it out.  Not even close.  Teddie Organics is the best product ever.</li>
    <li> This product has transformed my complexion and minimized my pores!! I love it!</li>
    <li> Nice scent, not overwhelming. Feels good on the skin. Will continue to use.</li>
    <li> Love this rose water - great quality, packaging, and exceptional service. I am new to using rose water, so I have not been using it long enough to adequately judge the effectiveness, however it appears to be a great quality rose water. It was delivered exactly as described and I am especially pleased with the customer service I have received from Teddie Organics. I am looking to purchase a few other items, and I would definitely look to purchasing it from them due to the quality of service I have received.</li>
    <li> I broke-out the two separate occasions I tried this. I really wanted it to work because of all the good reviews, but it did not work for me :(. Then again, my face is very sensitive, breaks out to even shea butter.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving 4stars for customer services though...keep it up!</li>
    <li> This is best product, I love it, will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Great product. Great packaging. I wish all companies took as much care as this one to insure liquid items don&#x27;t leak!</li>
    <li> i have extremely sensitive skin but i have no problem using this product. it refreshes and soothes my face as advertised. also the aroma of this toner is natural and pleasant. i will definitely re-purchase it in the future.</li>
    <li> Wonderful! You can tell they care about their product quality.</li>
    <li> Great product line, a definite redo!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the product and even more so with the seller.  One of the bottles I ordered was broken when it arrived and after contacting Teddie Organics, I had a replacement bottle within a few days.  Highly recommend both the product and the seller!</li>
    <li> I purchased this Rose Water (4 oz) for the first time a few weeks ago and am incredibly impressed with both the product and the customer service.  Prior to my order arriving I received an e-mail from the co-owners of the company stating that there had been a slight error on the side of their supplier and that the 4 oz bottle may have a pump top as opposed to the advertised spray top. They encouraged me to let them know if I received the pump top bottle and to contact them if I preferred the spray top version instead.  I had ordered the Rose Water to use as a facial spray toner, so when I confirmed that I had received the wrong top they IMMEDIATELY sent me out a complimentary 2 oz bottle of Rose Water with a spray top!  The Rose Water itself smells heavenly, feels great on my skin and I love using it underneath my moisturizer.  I use it to both hydrate and tone and am really loving the product so far.  My impression of Teddie Organics is that they are very proud of their products and that customer satisfaction is a priority.  I will definitely order from them again.</li>
    <li> I have to first say what an awesome company this is. I bought this rose water to spray on my face as a toner but when it came in it was a pump top (not what I was expecting), however, the product smelled so divine I decided to just try to use it with a cotton ball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It felt amazing and I wasn&#x27;t mad about the top anymore but then the company actually contacted me via email-- they apologized about the top, suggested the use of the cotton ball, and then said if I wanted the spray feature they had a solution. I respected the fact that they were honest enough to apologize without a complaint and on top of that they sent me a free bottle with the spray feature, via priority mail!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their product is divine and their customer service is excellent! I&#x27;m looking through more of their products because I actually feel good about purchasing from them!</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift. It smells great and is very refreshing!</li>
</ol>
