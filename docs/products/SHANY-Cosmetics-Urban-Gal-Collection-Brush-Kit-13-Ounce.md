    <li> Got these brushes on time and I love them!</li>
    <li> These brushes are perfect. Just the basics you need. They are durable and clean easily. The put on product smoothly and evenly.</li>
    <li> I would change one thing about this travel set. I would add another large fluffy brush for blush, count our or foundation. I hate using the same large brush for all of those because I don&#x27;t want blush all over my face or splotchy bronzer.</li>
    <li> These brushes are very soft and durable. They don&#x27;t shed a lot  even after washing. The case is nice with the magnetic closing.</li>
    <li> The brushes were not the best quality but what can you expect for such a low price. I use them for traveling so I wont mind leaving them behind.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used the sponge applicators to put my eyeshadow on. I&#x27;m getting a little older and wiser. The sponge pulls the eyelid too much so I thought it was time to look into buying brushes. These are great. You even get a powder/blush brush and eyebrow brush. I have found that none of the bristles come out like the cheap ones so this gets a 5 star rating.</li>
    <li> I like the box it came in and the brush kit.  Although I was expecting more sturdier brushes, they will suffice.  I am a satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> For the begginer make up artist is a really great start !Excellent quality,presentation ,dont&#x27; smell funny ,hair is soft and the bag is awesome too!</li>
    <li> got for our niece. She loves them. work well for what she uses them for.  would buy again if in need</li>
    <li> For only $10, this was such a good purchase. I just got these yesterdays, each of the brushes are soft and very sturdy. I&#x27;ll update my review on how these perform when I apply my makeup</li>
    <li> Great brush set love the convenient travel case, arrived in great time and recommend this brush set to anyone looking for a quality set of brushes.</li>
    <li> I use these brushes everyday. Easy to clean, use, soft bristle, It&#x27;s a great brush kit if your a beginner.</li>
    <li> Have not really used these yet as I am still using what I bought a few months ago...also from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;The length of the handles are just right - not too short and not too long. The bristles seem to be of good quality.&lt;br /&gt;I love the whole set and the price is not bad either and the set would be good for when I travel....so I&#x27;ll give it 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Amazon.</li>
    <li> my first make up set, it is okay I suppose not too sure what else to say since I am a noob</li>
    <li> This brush set is well put together, a brush for every need. The case is lightweight and very durable. Very good value</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these brushes!!! After I cleaned them they were incredibly soft. I haven&#x27;t had any shedding problems and they didn&#x27;t smell when I first received them. I also ordered some more shany products and am in love with those as well. I also ordered brushes for Christmas gifts because of the good quality. Think I&#x27;ll be sticking with them for a while.</li>
