      <li>That&#x27;s fine if you&#x27;re just taking makeup off before bed, but if you want your eyes totally free of makeup you may need to follow up with some eye makeup remover.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This definitely gets rid of all your makeup at the end of the day. It even removes glitter or sparkles that were on your face. I would definitely repurchase this again</li>
    <li> I loooove these. I use them after biking to work, or after a workout if I don&#x27;t have time to shower. They are so soft and smell so good! I first discovered them in New Zealand, and am so happy that I can buy them here in the US.</li>
    <li> Come in handy for backpacking &amp; camping.</li>
    <li> Remove the make up and the general &amp;#34;blah&amp;#34; stuff on my face at the end of the day.</li>
    <li> These are not too scented, clean mildly.  Pretty large.  Could be more textured.</li>
    <li> Best face wipes! Gentle enough for your eyes as well. I have acne prone skin and it doesn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
    <li> UGH these are the greatest!!! When I was living abroad, I couldn&#x27;t find these anywhere and I missed the heck out of them...I feel like I had raccoon eyes the entire time. I give them four stars because they don&#x27;t make them in larger packs than 25, but other than that, these rule.</li>
    <li> These are great for quickly cleaning your face and they leave me feeling refreshed.</li>
    <li> Loves these facial wipes for when my face gets really oily in the middle of the day, it usually takes the oil almost all away and leaves your face feeling fresh!</li>
    <li> These are a great alternative to other face wipes such as Neutrogena or Burts Bees.&lt;br /&gt;The product is used to wipe your face at night and clean off your makeup - without having to wash, take a shower, etc. It is supposed to be convenient and &amp;#34;simple&amp;#34; to use. It is supposed to be for sensitive skin with no irritants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would recommend. I would recommend for the behavior and product type as well as the fact its for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Good product, even for sensitive and dry skin.</li>
    <li> My kids use everyday. Easy to take anywhere</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo971UVKM3OBAY]]I do not have overly sensitive skin but my wife does. She is not able to the use the exfoilating wipes that Simple makes, [[ASIN:B00CHHK0CW Simple Exfoliating Wipes, 25 Count]] so we decided to try the Simple Cleansing Facial Wipes in addition to the exfoilating wipes. These wipes suit her sensitive skin much better and I use these as well when I do not want to use the exfoilating wipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like these wipes for several reasons... they have no fragrance, they contain no ethyl alcohol and they do not have oil. They leave my skin feeling clean, cool and refreshed. They do not dry my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seal  of the package is very effective at keeping the moisture in the package. I also like that these wipes aren&#x27;t overly saturated with liquid... they&#x27;re just the right amount of damp to clean your face and neck. The size is just right too, they measure  7\\&quot; x 7.5\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was quite confused at first that the packaging clearly states that these contain \\&quot;No Alcohol\\&quot; yet in the ingredients is listed \\&quot;Ceterayl Alcohol.\\&quot; I called the company to inquire about this discrepancy and was informed that \\&quot;No Alcohol\\&quot; refers to the lack of Ethyl or SD Alcohol. The claim made is that Ceterayl Alcohol is actually a \\&quot;fatty alcohol\\&quot; and is not in fact drying to the skin but actually aids in moisturizing the skin. I find this to be confusing to the consumer... it certainly was to me and I let the company know my feelings about the \\&quot;No Alcohol\\&quot; claim.</li>
    <li> I use these because I have dry skin and can&#x27;t wash my face with water twice a day. I tried 2 other brands and they both irritated my skin.  Simple products do the job and don&#x27;t give my skin any other problems.</li>
    <li> I use this every night &amp; it works well. It even gets the waterproof makeup off my eyes! It&#x27;s also not harsh on my skin.</li>
    <li> I use this before I wash my face at night. I take my makeup off. it doesn&#x27;t take all of my makeup completely off as I can see some foundation on a cotton ball when I wipe my face with astringent. I use this because it doesn&#x27;t burn my skin or make it sting as regular makeup remover wipes do because of the alcohol content. It&#x27;s sensitive enough for me, and it works for now until I can find a more effective makeup remover/skin cleansing wipe.</li>
    <li> These are fantastic. I purchase them regularly now and use them daily.</li>
    <li> I have used other facial wipes before to remove my make-up but these are the best I have tried. No perfumes and it leaves my skin clean and feeling soft. I recommend these for anyone looking for a good cleansing wipe without a heavy perfume scent.</li>
    <li> I have ordered these before and this is my recommended brand of makeup wipes.</li>
    <li> It is not easy to find items that do not contain exotic substances or have exotic smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not mined fragrance but they all get mixed up with other items and you start smelling like a chemical factory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vitamin may be a good selling point and some things are absorbed in the skin. But I cannot detect any vitamin goodness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The store well and are easy to handle. The directions come on the package. There is even a&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a problem with the exfoliating version. So I suggest that you test it on a small area before diving in for the first time. If you do find that you have an allergy you will not want to give the product a bask wrap; just be aware that that many people have allergies to the most benign sounding substances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway enjoy a clean face and live fragrance free.</li>
    <li> Keep these in my nightstand for evenings I&#x27;m too exhausted to do anything but fall into bed. Do a nice gentle job cleaning off the makeup and daily grime.</li>
    <li> I love these - especially for travel. Easy to use and I don&#x27;t have to be near sink to have a clean face or take off makeup. They don&#x27;t dry my skin out.</li>
    <li> These are great for a quick wipe and refresh for times that you can&#x27;t wash your face fully.  They do not remove eye makeup properly and are a bit harsh under the eyes.</li>
    <li> Really nice. Got this as part of my bridesmaids gifts to give my girls i hope they like them!</li>
    <li> These are my favorite face wipes. My esthetician recommended them and they do not make me break out (which I tend to have a problem with) sometimes if it&#x27;s tricky getting your eye makeup off- wet the cloth a little more and that usually helps.</li>
    <li> I have used these for at least a year and love them! They have caused no irritation or redness on my sensitive skin.  I have tried many different products and they burn or make my face red and these have done neither! They are simply refreshing and (used with the exfoliating wipes every couple of days) I haven&#x27;t needed any other products to clean my face. I highly recommend these!</li>
    <li> These face wipes are so convenient &amp; so easy to use – they leave my face looking great, really awesome as a makeup remover and you can keep a pack in your car so you can clean your face at any time. My skincare regimen is pretty extensive, but this is a must! Two other must haves are the best face cleanser I have found [[ASIN:B00VSF4T26 Skingenixx Complete Exfoliating Facial Cleanser!]] and best moisturizer  [[ASIN:B00VSCKY1E Skingenixx Hyaluronic Acid Facial Moisturizer.]]. These are all great products that work! I would recommend that you try them!</li>
    <li> I used these camping. Worked great. Kept my face clean and breakout free. I would buy these again for vacations and gym bags too.</li>
    <li> perfect for removing make-up and cleansing by super sensitive skin</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really like the product, I bought these wipes with the intention of using it before I went to sleep cuz I&#x27;m usually to tired/lazy to use my regular cleanser which I use in the morning.  The wipes were too thick for my liking, it was like a thick napkin. My face didn&#x27;t feel clean after using it, they weren&#x27;t really moist (idk if they were suppose to be like that or not, but I guess I just got used to using acne pads that are really moist). I&#x27;m not sure if this would be a good way to remove makeup since I don&#x27;t wear makeup. I think I&#x27;ll just stop being lazy and use my cleanser at night and just give these to my mom</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using these cloths, it is great for my sensitive acne prone skin. I only use them to remove makeup if when i wear it.</li>
    <li> now I&#x27;m obsessed.  I hate facewash because it dries my face out.  I wish these came in larger wholesale sizes because I go through these so quickly!  My skin is awesome, works well around my eyes and doesn&#x27;t dry me out.  Definitly not the harsh chemically feeling and works just the same if not better.  Takes off my makeup and cleans as well.  Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> This make-up remover wipes are great! They are very soft and wet so make-up comes off pretty easily and I&#x27;ve even used them twice sometimes!</li>
    <li> I love these wipes when on the go! They are easy to use and extremely convienent.  I get the same just washed feeling as I do from using soap and water.  I always love Simple brand products because they are great for my sensitive skin and don&#x27;t contain harsh chemicals.</li>
    <li> I have a very sensitive skin so was looking for wipes that would be gentle and at the same time would remove dirt and eye makeup.&lt;br /&gt;This was exactly what i was looking for. I do tend to break out when i use new products but this one did not.</li>
    <li> A step above the most sensitive skin rated wipes from the store. I use these almost daily and need this level of gentle effective cleaning. Great for a fresh face when you crawl into bed exausted and realize you forgot to wash. Great for all needs!! My hands love them!</li>
    <li> Best prices through Amazon with the same quality and fastest delivery I could have imagined.  The product really does take the day&#x27;s grime off your face leaving it feeling squeaky clean with very little effort.</li>
    <li> good price, good product, have been using them&lt;br /&gt;since they came on the market. Leaves face&lt;br /&gt;feeling clean, removes most everything.</li>
    <li> It removes some of the makeup off but the wipe feels too rough on my skin.  The pouch is small, resealable, durable.  Never irritates my skin and can be used several times throughout the day.</li>
    <li> One daughter loves them and the other doesn&#x27;t. But there a good price and you can buy as many or as little as you would like!</li>
    <li> I got this with a coupon, so i didn&#x27;t mind trying it out. I don&#x27;t usually use wipes, so it&#x27;s hard for me to compare it to other brands, but the wipes seems a little on the dry side. They seem to do a decent job with cleaning, but since it&#x27;s not moist enough, I still wash my face after using them.</li>
    <li> I purchased these wipes since they were advertised as a face wipe for sensitive skin.  However it just ended up irritating my skin even more.  The wipes were very rough and not soft at all.  It also didn&#x27;t take all of my make off.  I always end up using another make up remover to get anything the wipe missed.  I will definitely be going back to the original ultra calming wipes I had for sensitive skin before.</li>
    <li> I am lazy before I stumbled into bed. I also wear make up. Though I&#x27;ve had the proper washing technique demonstrated to me by my husband who doesn&#x27;t understand why I need a facial wipe, I insist that turning on the water, waiting for it to warm up enough not to freeze my face off, and scrubbing off water proof mascara whilst water runs down my elbows is a barrier to maintain appropriate facial hygiene. I&#x27;ve tried many wipes before, but always break out (with pimples, not song and dance). I do have sensitive skin, but couldn&#x27;t find a good product that works. Until now! These are moisturizing and really do the job!!! I sound like a neutrogena commercial.. but for like 30 year olds. Try these! Only complaint? Only 25. Not even enough to get me through a solid month, bros?</li>
    <li> Are there really all ingredients listed? [...] and [...] sources indicate parabens and other highly dangerous components. Why is it so hard to take care of consumers&#x27; health instead of poisoning them.</li>
    <li> I use these everyday and they are simply the best cleansing cloths I&#x27;ve ever tried, and I&#x27;ve used many!</li>
    <li> Picked these up a few days ago at Target &amp; haven&#x27;t had a chance to use them until today and they are AMAZING! They took off all of my makeup with ease, no sticky residue after using them which I LOVED! Highly recommended</li>
    <li> Our favorite facial cleansing cloths!</li>
    <li> no burning, no face reddening, very gentle product comparatively.  Sent was pleasant, and not overpowering, would recommend this product to all skin types.</li>
    <li> I got this for after gym class to put in my gym locker at my High School, I don&#x27;t wear makeup at all ever but I do get very oily especially my t-zone and my nose. Yesterday night after washing my face in the shower I tried one of the wipes on my face but not near my eyes. Maybe 5 seconds after my face got every hot and itchy and red, I waited a minute and when that didn&#x27;t subside I washed my face with cold water and my face was fine after that, thank god I didn&#x27;t get it near my eyes. I also read other reviews saying that there is EDTA in this product which is a harsh chemical, this product false advertised that there is no dyes, chemicals or perfume in it. Unfortunately I have blonde hair and blue eyes which means I&#x27;m very sensitive to allergies and I also have sensitive skin, I really wanted to use this for school but now 6 bucks wasted I have no idea what to do with them. Never use any new products without reading the reviews first.</li>
    <li> Bought these at a brick-and-mortar, not Amazon. HORRIBLE. Wipe is rough (ugh), but more problematic is the fact that I could feel a warmth/burning after using it. I was tired so I just went to bed... Woke up with redness and little pinhead whiteheads. Took an antihistamine, but 24hrs later it&#x27;s worse!! Just applied 1% hydrocortisone to my face to see if I can catch this irritation/allergy before it gets any worse. Such a misleading product.</li>
    <li> I love these wipes. They take off all of my makeup with just one wipe, but they aren&#x27;t so wet that they drip. They don&#x27;t dry my skind out, or make it greasy. I tend to have very sensitive skin, and these are great for it.</li>
    <li> As advertised, Simple is good for sensitive skin. I suffer from adult acne and struggle to find products that keep it under control without burning or damaging my sensitive skin. I also use their facial scrub which uses rice as an exfoliant, rather than plastic (that&#x27;s people....many products use PLASTIC to exfoliate your delicate skin!!!!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I order this regularly through Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe and Save and comes out cheaper than the drugstore.</li>
    <li> My daughters and I love this product.  We use this when we are busy or to lazy to wash our face.  My one daughter likes to carry them in her sports bag to freshen up.  I like them when I am just to tired to wash my face.  Great product and price is competitive.</li>
    <li> Great value and product. My teenage daughters use these every day and are quite pleased with them. I used to buy a more expensive brand and found out these work terrific for the cost.</li>
    <li> Works very well though these leave a moisturizing residue on my face - like a film or sheen that I would rather not have. Never irritates my skin and can be used several times throughout the day. Removes oil and dirt (the weave of the fabric is what does the scrubbing and cleaning - imagine one of those super expensive Bounty paper towels) without harsh chemicals.</li>
    <li> My fav makeup-romver wipes.</li>
    <li> I received a 10ct of these in my WalMart Beauty Box and I feel in love. These are great to keep with you when going from work to the gym or school. They don&#x27;t require water or even a sink and cleanse your face so you feel wonderful and refreshed. I have sensitive skin and my face did not break out or become overly dry. Def. reccomend this product</li>
    <li> I have used these wipes for a long time.  I have combination, sensitive skin and these cleansing wipes really work well.</li>
    <li> Love these face wipes. I have been using them for a couple of years and cannot use anything else - as it will irritate my face.</li>
    <li> These are my favorite facial wipes.  They do a great job removing all of my make-up including my eye make-up.  I&#x27;ve actually gotten several friends using them.  I&#x27;m too lazy to stand at the sink and wash my face so this is a good alternative.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these. These face wipes are by far the best I have used and I use them a few times a day just to wipe away any oil. The wipes smell very fresh and none of them were dry at all. They make my face feel so clean and I definitely will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> I used these and within 24 hours had a severe allergic reaction that I&#x27;ve never had before to any skin products. My skin broke out in red, itchy bumps  anywhere it made contact with these wipes, even on my eyelids and especially around my mouth. I have no idea what I could be allergic to in these wipes since this has never happened before, but my skin is somewhat sensitive to skin products. I currently use CeraVe face moisturizer, which is very gentle on my skin but maybe something about the combination of the two could have caused this reaction? I&#x27;m not sure, but I would strongly caution anyone with sensitive skin against these wipes. The red itchy bumps took about a week to clear up and thankfully didn&#x27;t leave any scars.</li>
    <li> Love this product, I usually buy it in stores if I don&#x60;t have any left but its nice to stock up anyway.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> Works well to remove make up and grime on sensitive skin.  I received this product in exchange for an honest review.  I would buy these again.  They leave your face feeling clean and refreshed without over drying.</li>
    <li> These wipes are so convenient! I use them anytime, day or night. It&#x27;s such an awesome feeling to use one right after waking up in the morning and right before going to bed. I love how refreshed my face feels! *I have received this product as a promotion in exchange for my honest review. I have received no instruction or influence by anyone. All thoughts and opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> These do a good job of removing ALL of my makeup.  So handy to use and toss.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin.  This doesn&#x27;t irritate it, surprisingly.  Works to take off makeup.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these face wipes! Get them in my monthly subscription from Amazon!</li>
    <li> These are a fraction of the cost of the facial wipes I usually buy.  Great quality.</li>
    <li> I am really pleased with this product which I have been using for several months now.  I am especially happy that they are sold as a 2-pack and as an Add-On Item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I order all the time from Amazon so automatically that it is easy to forget to use the Add-On feature.  So, I enter them as a purchase but before purchasing put them in the Saved For Later option (That may not be the exact name.) and add them in when I purchase something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS--there are many different Simple products available on Amazon.  When I ran out in the past (before the Add-On feature) I had bad luck in local stores--empty shelves with only the products I didn&#x27;t want left.</li>
    <li> The wipes are not sufficiently moist and do not easily remove makeup. A bit disappointing! They are unscented - which is nice but just not damp enough.</li>
    <li> works great, even on waterproof eye liner and waterproof mascara!</li>
    <li> A very soothing and cleansing way to wash your face and look radiant day after day.</li>
    <li> It said buy one get one free and I only received one.</li>
    <li> Great price and good for sensitive skin! Love them!</li>
    <li> I like simplistic, basic, no chemical stuff for my face and eyes.  Will always continue to use.  I like that it removes eye shadow, eye liner, and mascara AND face makeup.  I use one side for my eyes, flip over, the other side for my face.  I follow up with the Simple Facial Scrub Cleanser (not sure exact name).  So I do like the line of Simple products.  Gets all my makeup off cleanly.  Smells fresh, no harsh smells.  Amazon has best price.</li>
    <li> The fabric the wipes are made from are very rough. I feel like it scratches my eye area. I&#x27;m going to go back to Walmart brand.</li>
    <li> Good product. Leaves your face clean and moisturized</li>
    <li> Bought these just because they were inexpensive, and I needed face wipes fast. They work, but they feel almost abrasive on my skin. They may not have perfume, but they do have a scent, to my nose, and it&#x27;s very unpleasant. Won&#x27;t buy again, but not a total waste since they do actually work.</li>
    <li> These are exactly what they are called--simple.  Use them daily to take off make up and grime from being outside on a ranch...nice to your face...get em.</li>
    <li> These feel so great an refreshing at he end of the day. And they take off my waterproof mascara.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do a good job removing makeup, I have to use two cotton balls of toner after.</li>
    <li> these are a bit coarse in my opinion but they get the job done. They aren&#x27;t to soapy which is a plus. I don&#x27;t have a sticky residue on my face. My face actually feels clean. These are excellent for a gym bag or if you have to travel a lot and need to freshen up.</li>
    <li> they freshen without stripping your skin</li>
    <li> Anytime I try to use makeup removers or facial wipes my eyes sting and turn red, even the Organic and Say Yes brands. this stuff is gentle on my skin and eyes and i love them!</li>
    <li> I use these facial wipes every evening before I moisturize and I just love them. My skin is somewhat sensitive, but I have never had any issues with redness due to these products, and they are fairly soft. They do not leave my skin feeling dry, but they also don&#x27;t leave an oily residue on my skin. The wipes are big enough to wipe down your whole face and neck. They do okay with waterproof mascara and other eye makeup, but tend to leave a bit of smudginess behind when used to remove eyeliner or mascara. That&#x27;s fine if you&#x27;re just taking makeup off before bed, but if you want your eyes totally free of makeup you may need to follow up with some eye makeup remover. Other than that, no complaints!</li>
    <li> I have tried SO many different facial wipes to take off my make up since I always seem too lazy to give my face a full on wash every night before bed. These are my favorite wipes BY FAR! Not only do they take off all my make up (including mascara) but they don&#x27;t leave any sort of residue or oilyness on my face and I don&#x27;t break out with these! Which is huge! Every other wipe I had tried - from the inexpensive to the ridiculously expensive - they all made me break out if I didn&#x27;t rinse my face with water after using them. Which, for me,  totally defeats the purpose of having a wipe instead of washing my face in the sink. These are the only wipes I&#x27;ll use now.&lt;br /&gt;I also use the [[ASIN:B00CHHK1C6 Simple Facial Wash, Moisturizing 5 oz]] and the [[ASIN:B009RNUH7M Simple Moisturizer SPF15, Protecting Light 4.2 Ounce]] in my daily routine.</li>
