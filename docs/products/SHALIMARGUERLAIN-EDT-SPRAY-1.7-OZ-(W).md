    <li> SATISFIED  WITH  PRODUCT  RECEIVED  AND  ITS  PROMPT  DELIVERY....</li>
    <li> This is not the real Shalimar.  Fragrance does not last like the original. You have no recourse if you buy this product, returns are not allowed.  Save your money !</li>
    <li> As always perfect mom loved it</li>
    <li> this is my mothers favorite perfume</li>
    <li> As advertised quick shipment thanks yall</li>
    <li> If you have not tried Shalimar for a while, it is time to get spraying this lovely sweet scent again.  Your presence will linger alluringly after you have exited a room.  Just don&#x27;t overdo the amount you use.</li>
    <li> I give this as a gift to my best friend  and she loves it</li>
    <li> Have been using Shalimar for many years.  Occasionally try other perfumes but always return to Shalimar. It is the only perfume that I receive compliments and people want to know what I am wearing.</li>
    <li> While this was a requested gift, the quality seems to be on par with what was expected of it.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife on her Birthday. She love it, and I love the smell</li>
    <li> Just as she did Flower Bomb!&lt;br /&gt;She loves it and I am obliged to like it too.&lt;br /&gt;So these are her 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;(Personally I preferred Flower Bomb, but that means little or nothing).&lt;br /&gt;Bob</li>
    <li> I have used Shalimar Eau De Toilette Spray since I was 18 and am now 66 and have never been without it!</li>
    <li> I tried to switch perfumes a couple of times, but have always come back to Shalimar.  I love it.</li>
    <li> When young folks are turning to Bobby Brown and other flash in the pan fragrances, this classic perfume stands in a class of it&#x27;s own. Hard to get and overpriced in department stores, I have found Amazon to be my new source. When I was young and still attractive, the guys told me it smelled so good that they wanted to drink it. I still wear it because if it&#x27;s wonderful essence, but also because my kids identify me with Shalimar. I feel naked without it.</li>
    <li> A classic fragrance. My mother has been wearing this for over 50 years and I will always associate it with her.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite! I love that I was able to purchase it in the 3 oz size.  Would buy from this vendor again.</li>
    <li> I have worn Shalimar off &amp; on for a long, long, time. I&#x27;m dissapointed with this as the scent just doesn&#x27;t last. Not sure what the problem is, but next time I will get the Perfume &amp; buy it in a dept store!</li>
    <li> Very Nice, Just what I Needed...</li>
    <li> Shipping was great &amp; I received this as a gift from my husband. This scent is so wonderful! I have been getting it for the past 5 years.</li>
    <li> Great price for this size bottle! Original unopened package. The real deal for a great price.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing Shalimar for 50 years! OMG it is wonderful and the price was spectacular- Great Seller - Great Product! So good, I bought 2.</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite and at a nice price</li>
    <li> This was purchased for my wife who has worn this classic fragrance for 55 years. It is a light, oriental fragrance and not a heavy flowery scent.</li>
    <li> Just like I remembered if from years ago.  Lovely and light fragrance.  I get compliments every time I wear it.</li>
    <li> This was purchased as a gift for my grandmother. She personally loves this scent.</li>
    <li> Best price I found! NO problems. Great experience. Will buy again when needed.I have been using shalimar for years and LOVE it.</li>
    <li> Wife wears it…ran out of it…so I get her a BIG bottle at a LITTLE Amazon price. What could be better?</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been around since the beginning of time and sells well so obviously it is a well-known and loved brand. The blend of notes just weren&#x27;t to my personal preference. Not as &amp;#34;vanilla-y&amp;#34; as I wanted. Beautiful and classic package. I gave it to my Mom and she liked it. Came quickly and packaging was intact.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sorry to have to agree with those who suggest this is a modified product.  It has been my favorite for almost 50 years, but this latest purchase is missing something - it seems to lack depth of scent and does not have the long-lasting character I am used to.  Really too bad.</li>
    <li> What more can I say I&#x27;m 55 and all the women in my family wore shalimar and still it is the only parfum i ever wear since I&#x27;m 14 LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
    <li> I have worn Shalimar almost all my life. I have tried other fragrances, but always come back to my Shalimar</li>
    <li> I am not sure this isn&#x27;t counterfeit. It is not the same color nor does it seem to smell exactly like my previous bottle. This does not have the intensity of the older one and yes, they are both Eau de Toilette spray.&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, the bottle is a bit awkward to hold and spray.</li>
    <li> The fragrance doesn&#x27;t last long and the scent is not like the original Shalimar</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mom for mothers day.  Great gift.  This is her favorite perfume.  Great price.  Also bought lotion.</li>
    <li> First let me state that I have been wearing Shalimar daily for as long as I can remember. I wear no other scent.  It has become my trademark.  So much so that when my daughter put some on my young grand daughter said &amp;#34;you smell like grandma mommy.&amp;#34;  It is a scent that people remember and find welcoming and pleasant.</li>
    <li> I have worn Shalimar for many years, at least 40yrs, and I Just love the fact I can get it at a great price!!!</li>
    <li> I bought my wife her first bottle of Salamar when I was in the Navy and was in a port in France. She loved it and has been using Salamar ever since.&lt;br /&gt;Buying it through Amazon is a great savings.</li>
    <li> It still has the fragrance I enjoy but seem a little off from the original one I purchased.  I assume coming from Amazon that is is the real deal.</li>
    <li> Counterfeit! Do not buy!</li>
    <li> Only fragrance for my bride!</li>
    <li> I have used this for many many years, the only smell that I use.  Great price and customer service</li>
    <li> Still my favorite after 50 years.  Smells yummy.  Quality is consistent, packaging perfect.</li>
    <li> Shalimar has always been my perfume of choice. It has been hard to find in my area now and I was happy to see it listed on Amazon. It has a delicate scent and not too heavy like most of the perfumes out there today. I have had many people ask me what perfume I am wearing because it has such a wonderful scent.</li>
    <li> This is not Shalimar.  This is a poor imitation of the fragrance I&#x27;ve been using for years.  A complete waste of my money.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s her favorite and I bought it here because it was a lot less expensive than buying it from Saks or Nordstroms, etc.</li>
    <li> Bought 2 bottles for my wife.  She&#x27;s been wearing this since 1964.  Was very pleased with both price and prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> Nice warm scent.  This has been my signature scent for over 20 years.  Nice and light and not overbearing.</li>
    <li> Been using this for years, Nothing comes close to the real thing...imitations aren&#x27;t even close. Worth the $$$ for the real deal.</li>
    <li> I have been using Shalimar for about 4 to 6 years and it is a wonderful fragrance.  Just love it. Lee</li>
    <li> Best smelling perfume ever!</li>
    <li> I just love the Eau de Toilette Shalimar!  It is soft and feminine just like the lady that I am.  Men notice the fragrance and always comment on it&#x27;s beautiful scent.  Nothing like wearing a classic to stand out in a crowd.</li>
    <li> item as described. fast shipping</li>
    <li> Shalimar never fails.  It is classic.  In my business, I hug a lot of people and many, many times am rewarded with a hug in return, but also with the question, \\&quot;What are you wearing?  You smell so good.\\&quot;  Shalimar has never let me down and I&#x27;ve worn it since I was in high school.  I am now a senior citizen and still have stuck to my Shalimar.  When other \\&quot;fragrances\\&quot; cause people to turn away, aggrevate allergies, etc., Shalimar does not.  In one word, I would have to say Shalimar is Timeless!</li>
    <li> Item exactly as described and received in excellent condition.</li>
    <li> I was amazed at the size of the bottle in addition to the price.  I am so pleased and now I don&#x27;t have to worry about running out of the Shalimar because I can&#x27;t afford the price at Macy&#x27;s, Nordstrom&#x27;s or Von Maur.  It was way above my expectations!</li>
    <li> love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m technically not allergic to any perfumes, but the VAST majority tend to upset my sinuses.  Shalimar is the only one I&#x27;ve ever been able to find that didn&#x27;t, and it has a *wonderful* smell - I get lots of compliments on it when people actually get close enough to catch a whiff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;looking at product page just now, I definitely wouldn&#x27;t buy this at the current price ($79 after shipping)... when I made my purchase, it was from the seller \\&quot;Diamonds &amp; Jewelry\\&quot; and cost $54.99 (with free shipping) - that was an *excellent* deal!</li>
    <li> I have been using Shalimar for about 35 years. While this version of Shalimar is okay, it is not the traditional, classic Shalimar I LOVE. This product needs to be identified appropriately.</li>
    <li> This is not real Shalimar, it is a knockoff. Am Returning product.</li>
    <li> This was a gift to my friend who has a Birthday in December.  She has been using the Shalimar for many years. The product was due to arrive sooner and was held up by the ice storm we had in Dallas.It still arrived with in a very short time . The price of the Shalimar was excellent. This company was great deals on toilette sprays and perfume. I have used this company before and have always been pleased with their products.</li>
    <li> Shalimar my favorite scent.  Been buying Shalimar since the 1970&#x27;s.  Great price for the De Toilette recommend to anyone who loves a soft scent.  So many compliments over the years.</li>
    <li> We bought the first bottle at Water Tower Place in Chicago on a whim.&lt;br /&gt;She used to have it as a girl and I loved the smell.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon made it easy to get it again.&lt;br /&gt;We checked prices of the major Internet chains for this product and Amazon was very close.&lt;br /&gt;Then with 2 day free shipping for Primer members - it was an easy decision.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this is real Shalimar. I previously received authentic Shalimar as a gift and fell in love with the scent. This product has a similar scent, but is \\&quot;off\\&quot; enough that I will not buy it again. From now on, I&#x27;m going to a retail store and buying it from a place where I can try it out first.</li>
    <li> This bottle of Shalimar was much cheaper on Amazon than at the department store. I needed to replace one that is nearly gone.  I checked at the store and online and this was much better by probably 20 % or more (don&#x27;t recall the exact numbers).  As long as I can get free shipping and save money, I am here!  I am a big Amazon fan!</li>
    <li> It is my favorite fragranceand has been  for many years.Beautiful memories from wearing this! I also like the lotion .I would like to see &amp;#34;Special Sales &amp;#34;on their products.</li>
    <li> Great delivery. Love this product</li>
    <li> The samples are fine.  I would have rated them five stars, but they don&#x27;t smell like the cologne, which is what I like.</li>
    <li> First time I have bought the toilette in years. Forgot how wonderful it is.  I have used a whole bottle of cologne and in same time only 1/3 bottle of toilette.  Do not use nearly as much</li>
    <li> The timeless fragrance of Shalimar goes on for ever. On the sholders of a woman pleasing to her and her man.</li>
    <li> All I can say is this is  Exotic, Romantic and Classic. Packaged nicely love the classic shape of the bottle! Looks so elegant on my vanity! Nice price and delivered in a Prime timely manner to my door. This is a classic scent! I know they have worked out with modern chemistry; but I have been satisfied with my purchases so far! I have made several purchases and I&#x27;m pleased.  THE CLASSIC SCENTS WILL ENDURE THE TEST OF TIME! Today imitations and celebrity scents flooding the beauty market are sad carnival fruity cotton candy colored water fancy bottles with dangle charms will not stand the test of time. Just the name Shalimar gives visions of scented warm nights with the lingering of soft exotic aromas not overpowering but intense hints of spice and floral scents. I love it and it makes me feel wonderful and that is what counts in my book! ~K</li>
    <li> Just wonderful...authentic product, beautiful classic perfume in a gorgeous bottle. I love it and will order more. very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I like to get a great price for the original authentic Shalimar, and this meets the criteria.  Shalimar is my signature scent, and I love the undertones on vanilla and sandalwood.  I would recommend this seller for your Shalimar purchase</li>
    <li> Shalimar has a nice scent to it.  I have been wearing it since I got it as a gift for my 16th birthday and that was a loooooong time ago...</li>
    <li> great product.  good seller</li>
    <li> Excellent...a bit pricey but great fragrance.</li>
    <li> Great price! I usually spend this price on a smaller product. This is the only scent my wife will use!</li>
    <li> As I have said once before -- both my Aunts have always used Shalimar and they trained me at an early age to use Shalimar...and I am still using it.  Just love Shalimar -- would never change to another perfume, toilette water or cologne.  This time around instead of using eau de perfum -- I ordered the toilette.  Its very nice.  Not strong but just right!! I wish they would bring back Shalimar light -- this was just fabulous.</li>
    <li> A classic, but wish they hadn&#x27;t changed the formula.</li>
    <li> I have been using this perfume for a very long time. My grandmother used it and I loved the way the perfume smelled on her. Whenever I wear this perfume people stop me and ask what I am wearing. I think that it is a very classy beautiful perfume that is so different then much of the perfumes out today. I was concerned when I read reviews saying that people thought the perfume smelled differently then what they remembered or that this was not the original perfume, and/or that it was a knockoff. I don&#x27;t smell any difference at all.</li>
    <li> Great product, the wife loved it - :)</li>
    <li> Gorgeous scent!  I have used it for many years and always receive compliments.</li>
    <li> Shalimar is my favorie perfume - this arrrived as described in a large bottle.  Great Buy....I would buy it again!</li>
    <li> The first time I sampled this in a local store I was hooked and it is the only scent I wll use. It makes me feel good and that&#x27;s what important. I just spritz it on lightly so its not overpowering. Yes it is a bit pricey&lt;br /&gt;but I&#x27;m worth it.LOL</li>
