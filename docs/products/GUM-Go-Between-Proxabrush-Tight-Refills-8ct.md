      <li>Just glad to get them.  </li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t find these in the stores locally, and was happy to get them through Amazon at a good price.  </li>
      <li>AND THIS IS SURELY</li>
      <li>But I haven&#x27;t been able to find them&lt;br /&gt;for</li>
      <li>so I was glad to see it here on Amazon.</li>
      <li>many others were wider.</li>
      <li>Recommended by my dentist &amp; hygienist for gum health for cleaning between teeth, better than flossing.</li>
      <li>The long handle works best for me since it gets around my teeth better.</li>
      <li>They bend easily and I don&#x27;t yet know how many times they will flex before breaking.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good deal, a good savings over individual packs, also since we travel a Loy</li>
      <li>They do fit ok, but would have preferred the ones I ordered.</li>
      <li>Easy to find, easy to order, easy to use.</li>
      <li>Thankfully, I was able to order these quickly and easily.</li>
      <li>, I appreciate that this is a more economical way to purchase them.</li>
      <li>Ordering from Amazon was not only easier than driving around, but a 6-pack of the packages was a great bargain.  </li>
      <li>A LIFETIME SUPPLY I WILL ENJOY USING THEM ALMOST FOR FOEVER</li>
      <li>Have to use these permanently since oral surgery, so hope they continue to be available</li>
      <li>I never feel that my teeth are really clean until I have used Go Betweens.</li>
      <li>Be sure you really need &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>New item, good price, fast delivery.  </li>
      <li>and I got them quickly.  </li>
      <li>These are much better and more comfortable than the wide model.</li>
      <li>Good dental care made better with these little brushes!</li>
      <li>Since I use these pretty regularly and they need to be changed fairly often</li>
      <li>These are great for cleaning between tight spots between teeth.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t useful for me.</li>
      <li>So I do believe they are well worth what I pay for them.</li>
      <li>Not as useful as the wide size, but still good.</li>
      <li>I use all the time and find them as useful as dental floss in cleaning between your teeth.</li>
      <li>Good marks from my dentist since using these little things</li>
      <li>can use them a number of times before throwing them away, and rinse them with hot water after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product is excellent for cleaning between the hard to reach back teeth.  </li>
      <li>These really work well for getting between teeth to remove food.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>My dentist suggested using the Proxabrush; it&#x27;s so much easier than just flossing.</li>
      <li>They fit the long handle that I have.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I think that the little brushes do a better job than floss.  </li>
      <li>They seem to loosen the plaque a little better.</li>
      <li>the brush proves that, then I brush the regular way.</li>
      <li>These are small enough to get between my teeth &amp; do a good job of helping me with my dental hygiene.  </li>
      <li>Could not get the right size locally.  </li>
      <li>6 packs sloppily wrapped in plastic, but the retail package itself is in fairly good condition.</li>
      <li>The first two (Upper) were no problem with flossing and brushing.</li>
      <li>Seller sent me exactly what I needed, with just enough packaging without wasting a tree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Came quickly and were just as expected.</li>
      <li>Just watch how far you place in the proxabrush, if pushed too far then it doesn&#x27;t get all the way between the teeth.</li>
      <li>I like the &#x27;brush&#x27; action as I feel it cleans my teeth and gums in addition to flossing.</li>
      <li>Wire too soft.</li>
      <li>The new ones are narrow at the point and quickly thicken out.  </li>
      <li>They get into most of the small between teeth gaps that the larger brushes do not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I used to able to find small totally cylindrical brushes made by GUM.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I had expected...  </li>
      <li>But this product has been hard to fine elsewhere</li>
      <li>Initially didn&#x27;t want to buy so many, but I realized that a supply of them would mean I wouldn&#x27;t have to reorder soon.  </li>
      <li>only problems with the tight ones is that the wire is so fine they don&#x27;t last very long (and bend too easily) and there are still some teeth that tight are still too big to get between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>the Wide and Ultra Wide feel like I am putting a full size Christmas tree in between</li>
      <li>I really like these little brushes for cleaning between teeth and these are narrow enough to fit in the smallest gaps I have.</li>
      <li>In between the teeth where they did fit, it didn&#x27;t feel like they cleaned as well as the stiff rubber ones by the other brand.  </li>
      <li>Really works for tight areas.</li>
      <li>The refills I had before were shaped as shown in the little picture on the package -- straight like a pipe cleaner.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not t he same &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34; go betweens this company made in past.  They do not do the job!</li>
    <li> I use these on a daily basis and they were difficult to find so when I got the opportunity I purchased a quantity of them.  They do a great job between my teeth and I am very satisfied with there use.</li>
    <li> There is a piece missing between this product and the handle, this product does me no good and is NOT returnable.&lt;br /&gt;I am not a happy brusher!</li>
    <li> Good product if you have gum disease.</li>
    <li> My dentist suggested these after peridontal laser surgery.  Have them with me everywhere.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t like the metal core on the brush.  prefer the plastic cleaners from GUM.</li>
    <li> Same as what you get in the pharmacy at a price that I can&#x27;t find anywhere else. They do make thinner, cylindrical gobetweens. These are conical but, pretty small.</li>
    <li> I ordered &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34; brushes.  some were tight.  many others were wider.</li>
    <li> No problems. Exactly as expected, just like samples dentist gave me.  Have to use these permanently since oral surgery, so hope they continue to be available</li>
    <li> The tips are too narrow and flimsy.  Not worth purchasing.  I&#x27;m probably throwing out the rest.</li>
    <li> hard to find. awesome product</li>
    <li> These are much better and more comfortable than the wide model.</li>
    <li> This is a dental hygienist recommended item which is difficult to find in stores.  Seems to work well and is intended to assist in cleaning areas between teeth not reachable with a toothbrush and not cleaned well with floss.</li>
    <li> I really like these little brushes for cleaning between teeth and these are narrow enough to fit in the smallest gaps I have.</li>
    <li> Came quickly and were just as expected. Good job.</li>
    <li> These are fractionally larger at #414 than the #412, but still get between my tight spaces, and they last longer, too.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Does a good job. Does not replace floss. My dentist recommends.</li>
    <li> Good marks from my dentist since using these little things</li>
    <li> This product was Recommended by dentist to remove food particles.  Not a substitute for flossing.  Addition to your dental cleaning.</li>
    <li> Not as useful as the wide size, but still good.</li>
    <li> I never feel that my teeth are really clean until I have used Go Betweens.</li>
    <li> Delivered when promised. And, a proxabrush is proxabrush, etc.</li>
    <li> Just watch how far you place in the proxabrush, if pushed too far then it doesn&#x27;t get all the way between the teeth.</li>
    <li> These are small enough to get between my teeth &amp; do a good job of helping me with my dental hygiene.  I floss before I brush between &amp; flossing is truly not enough the brush proves that, then I brush the regular way.</li>
    <li> My dentist suggested using the Proxabrush; it&#x27;s so much easier than just flossing. The tight size is hard to find in our area, but, of course, it&#x27;s on Amazon. Easy to find, easy to order, easy to use. Great value.</li>
    <li> The Proxabrushes do a great job of cleaning between my teeth and my dentist and oral hygienist have noticed the difference.  They remove food particles even after I have done a thorough job of brushing.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended I use the proxabrush with the tight (small) heads.  Good luck finding them in the store!  Ordering from Amazon was not only easier than driving around, but a 6-pack of the packages was a great bargain.  They arrived as promised in great condition.</li>
    <li> Drug stores just don&#x27;t carry the size for teeth that are close together.  Thankfully, I was able to order these quickly and easily.</li>
    <li> I have recently had 4 molar implants. The first two (Upper) were no problem with flossing and brushing. The last two lower implants have been more difficult to take care of because of the food that gets lodged between the implants and around the post. There is an area that drives me crazy until I get the food out so I have been on a mission of sorts to see what works best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First my dentist gave me samples, and then the hygienist gave me some different ones, plus I purchased some refills at the drug store.  I have brushes and picks in every size and shape, but at least I have some favorites and this product is one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This refill is a #414, is color coded GREEN, and is for \\&quot;tight\\&quot; areas.  There are actually four sizes: Tight, Moderate, Wide and Ultra Wide.  I can use the \\&quot;tight\\&quot; size in between all of my teeth at the gum line and the \\&quot;moderate\\&quot; fits in a few areas.  Both the Wide and Ultra Wide feel like I am putting a full size Christmas tree in between my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can use them a number of times before throwing them away, and rinse them with hot water after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be forewarned:  These are REFILLS for either a Proxabrush brush or a similar one made by Oral B.  I would advise purchasing small quantities at first to see what size fits your dental needs.  When the brush is inserted into the handle it is the size of a regular toothbrush and probably not something you would carry in your purse.  You might want to purchase something smaller for travel or eating out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this size for a while. It seems that all the major drug stores including Walmart only Carrie wide. There are four sizes. I know that when I turn to Amazom I always managed to find what I&#x27;m looking for. I&#x27;m really happy with the product. Great fit.</li>
    <li> Very good product!  Exactly what I had expected...  I previously ordered supply and had no hesitation for re-order...  Very pleased customer. :-D</li>
    <li> MET ALL EXPECTATIONS - PROMPT SHIPMENT AND THIS IS SURELY A LIFETIME SUPPLY I WILL ENJOY USING THEM ALMOST FOR FOEVER</li>
    <li> New item, good price, fast delivery.  No complaints.</li>
    <li> bought this product here online because it&#x27;s hard to find in the drug store.  It&#x27;s probably because of the labeling...&amp;#34;tight&amp;#34; means small or able to get into small spaces.  Their labeling methods needs to be reviewed.  Good product though, if/when you can find it.</li>
    <li> I have used these &amp;#34;pick-like&amp;#34; objects by another brand that contained no metal, and they worked well but did not have any specifically for tight areas.  I tried these.  The sharp metal kept hurting my gums, and were not small enough for the tight areas after all.  In between the teeth where they did fit, it didn&#x27;t feel like they cleaned as well as the stiff rubber ones by the other brand.  These picks are a good idea, but the others worked much, much better for me.  I would not recommend these.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find these in the stores locally, and was happy to get them through Amazon at a good price.  Initially didn&#x27;t want to buy so many, but I realized that a supply of them would mean I wouldn&#x27;t have to reorder soon.  After all, I use them every day.</li>
    <li> Even through they were &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34; they are very short and narrow.Be sure you really need &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  Definitely removes food particles left behind that brushing misses. Will improve my dental checkups.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with these Gum Go Between Proxabrush refills because I had surgery on my gums years ago and have had to use these proxabrushes for a good 20 years.  I receive great checkups at the dentist every cleaning visit.  So I do believe they are well worth what I pay for them.</li>
    <li> Great product....just what the Dentist ordered.  Would have preferred the holder being shipped via amazon like these were because of the extra shipping involved.</li>
    <li> My mom.  She used to use oral b brush filler, but oral b is discontinued.  This is about the same size and fits, as another review noted, the oral b brush holder.  6 packs sloppily wrapped in plastic, but the retail package itself is in fairly good condition.</li>
    <li> None of the pharmacies or drug stores had these Gum brush refills.  When I found them on-line, I ordered a bunch.  Dentists prescribe the refills for these brushes.  I don&#x27;t know why they are so hard to find.  Anyway, they are what I wanted and I got them quickly.  I can recommend this seller.</li>
    <li> Can use only with GUM replacement brushes so it has a limited usefulness. The GUM products are somewhat confusing mix</li>
    <li> These are great for cleaning between tight spots between teeth. Though I still floss I like these better, like a furry tooth pick.</li>
    <li> It takes practice not to bend the brush when pushing through tight spaces. They are very effective getting food particles you didn&#x27;t know were there even after brushing and flossing.</li>
    <li> These work well for my teeth that have various amount of space between them. They fit the long handle that I have. The long handle works best for me since it gets around my teeth better.</li>
    <li> Just what a wanted and at a great price.  Thanks</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good deal, a good savings over individual packs, also since we travel a Loy I can put packs, in pocketbook, suitcase and the bathroom too</li>
    <li> happy with both item and seller</li>
    <li> clean teeth, happy teeth</li>
    <li> This performs as it should...great.  I think that the little brushes do a better job than floss.  They seem to loosen the plaque a little better.</li>
    <li> I wish the description used the numbers that are on my trial package from the doctor. But this product has been hard to fine elsewhere so I was glad to see it here on Amazon. Seller sent me exactly what I needed, with just enough packaging without wasting a tree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect. Will buy it again here.</li>
    <li> I use all the time and find them as useful as dental floss in cleaning between your teeth.</li>
    <li> You get six packs with this.  We thought we were over paying and then got a lot of product. 48 pieces.</li>
    <li> Refills for my brush andwas as expected</li>
    <li> Fits between my teeth, Great Product.</li>
    <li> They are way tpo short. They barely come out the other end of the tooth unlike the ones that come with individual handles. Because of this they become bent and distorted. Will not buy these again unless changes are made to improve them. A big waste of money.</li>
    <li> On time and as advertised</li>
    <li> Good dental care made better with these little brushes!</li>
    <li> NO HANDLES WERE INCLUDED WITH THE BRUSHES!!!!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s horrible that they were not included or even described not&lt;br /&gt;being included before I purchased Proxabrush refills... c</li>
    <li> The \\&quot;tight\\&quot; proxabrush refills are just what I wanted and ordered. They get into most of the small between teeth gaps that the larger brushes do not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only problems with the tight ones is that the wire is so fine they don&#x27;t last very long (and bend too easily) and there are still some teeth that tight are still too big to get between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also ordered \\&quot;wide\\&quot; only because I couldn&#x27;t find \\&quot;extra-wide\\&quot; on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For both sizes, the brushes eventually wear out - getting either shorter or come off the wire, but each one lasts at least a week for my use (daily).</li>
    <li> I had been given samples from my dentist. I ordered the medium, but was sent the tight ones instead. I decided to go ahead and keep them. They do fit ok, but would have preferred the ones I ordered. This is why I rated it a 4. Would have given them a 5 if I had received what I had ordered.</li>
    <li> Not the same as they once were.  The brush length is too short and the stems are weak.  Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> I interpreted &amp;#34;Tight&amp;#34; as for use with teeth that are close together. Instead, the Proxabrush Tight Refill starts small at the tip, buts get increasingly large at the base. It isn&#x27;t useful for me. I used to able to find small totally cylindrical brushes made by GUM. But I haven&#x27;t been able to find them&lt;br /&gt;for over a year.</li>
    <li> Really works for tight areas.</li>
    <li> great product - as advertised</li>
    <li> The refills I had before were shaped as shown in the little picture on the package -- straight like a pipe cleaner.  The new ones are narrow at the point and quickly thicken out.  I don&#x27;t like that -- afterall, I ordered tight because I need the narrower size and the thicker ones are difficult to use in tight spaces -- DUH.</li>
    <li> I ordered the long narrow shape. The shape of the brushes on the package show the long narrow type, however, the brushes are a narrow cone shape.</li>
    <li> Good product at a great price.</li>
    <li> Since I use these pretty regularly and they need to be changed fairly often, I appreciate that this is a more economical way to purchase them.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent for cleaning between the hard to reach back teeth.  I like the &#x27;brush&#x27; action as I feel it cleans my teeth and gums in addition to flossing.</li>
    <li> Used before.  Could not get the right size locally.  This answered that problem.  Just glad to get them.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> These really work well for getting between teeth to remove food. They bend easily and I don&#x27;t yet know how many times they will flex before breaking. My expectations are they will work great until it is time to replace the brush. Easy on the gums too!</li>
    <li> Wire too soft. Bend on slightest pressure.</li>
    <li> Very hard to find! Recommended by my dentist &amp; hygienist for gum health for cleaning between teeth, better than flossing.</li>
    <li> wrong product back to floss</li>
    <li> Brushes are too short.</li>
