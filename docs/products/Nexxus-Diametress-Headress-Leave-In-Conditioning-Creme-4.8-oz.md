      <li>I can use this product in much the same way I&#x27;d use gel or mousse, though, and I get excellent results with no allergy problems.  </li>

      <li>I miss the original leave in conditioner which has been discontinued by Nexxus.</li>
      <li>The best leave-in conditioner that I have ever found in the past 10 years.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! I am heartbroken that it is discontinued. I was delighted to get this on Amazon. I highly recommend this product. It arrived on time and is as described.</li>
    <li> I have used Nexxus Headress leave in conditioner for years. It is a great product for my long, permed hair. Wouldn&#x27;t go a day without it!</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and thought I would give this a try. I also use the volumizing shampoo and have loved that for some time now. The conditioner is very runny, but once in the hair, it makes combing through it very easy. I am not sure if it provides more volume or not? I don&#x27;t really see a difference but it is a nice leave in conditioner either way.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t use gel or mousse, as I&#x27;m allergic to some ingredient in them.  I can use this product in much the same way I&#x27;d use gel or mousse, though, and I get excellent results with no allergy problems.  AND it keeps my hair in good condition.</li>
    <li> It leaves hair just a little too stiff for me and it&#x27;s unclear just how much will work for volume and how much is too much.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, it&#x27;s not a bad product but it isn&#x27;t how I want my hair to feel</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t ever order this product.</li>
    <li> No luscious volume whatsoever</li>
    <li> This is my wife&#x27;s favorite product. This is all she uses. It comes in a user friendly tube. Great buy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years.  It&#x27;s a decent detangler, a great conditioner, a voluminizer.  No silicones!  Lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this 4 times now.  I should have followed another reviewers suggestion to use very little (dime size portion) but the first time......I used a quarter size and it wasn&#x27;t pretty.  After that fiasco.....I used the dime size (remember...a little dab-will-do-ya).  Success!!&lt;br /&gt;My hair has always been very fine, straight, lifeless, and thin.  Now due to thyroid issues.....let&#x27;s just say there isn&#x27;t as much as there used to be.  Thyroid disease &#x3D;  hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;This product makes it feel thicker, lay better (less sticking-up issues due to its straight nature) and feel nice when touched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff.  I wish they could incorporated a magic potion into this so that I could grow more hair.  In lieu of that......this is surprising good.  Just don&#x27;t use much.....goes a long way and if needed add a bit of water to wet hair before blow dry if your hair feels too dry to blow.  Works for me.</li>
    <li> This was my first use for this product and I love it.  I&#x27;m a fan of Nexxus and this just continues the treadition.  It makes my hair appear and feel fuller without looking greasy.</li>
    <li> I miss the original leave in conditioner which has been discontinued by Nexxus. This replacement is OK until I find another brand of leave in conditioner.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used for fine thin hair.  I&#x27;m not crazy about the matching shampoo, but this is by far the best conditioner - it doesn&#x27;t build up or leave your hair sticky - adds just the right amount of volume - truly makes the hair thicker and fuller.  I notice  a HUGE difference when I don&#x27;t use it - shopped everywhere to find it again and then resorted to Amazon (thanks Amazon of carrying everything we could want!)....so happy to find it again!!! Get it - you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> I love love love this. I also use Nexxus the ultimate deep conditioner with this product and let me tell you it is a lifetime staple for my hair. I was a product junkie however now I am just a Nexxus girl.&lt;br /&gt;I am African American with low to moderate density which is getting thicker as the months go by however the thin strands will not change just the density. My hair is considerate a 3c-4a. I am telling you this works for me. I have already ordered another one before the other one runs out. I am hooked.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Great for fine hair. I have not been able to find it in stores, so I was glad to find it on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I have used this product...Nexxus Headress...for over 5 years and I am very pleased with the consistent results.  This leave-in conditioner keeps my hair looking healthy and never flat...it&#x27;s easy to apply and then blow-dry for a salon look.</li>
    <li> Great product so happy that Iwas able to purchase this now that you can no longer get them at the store, Awesome!!!!!</li>
    <li> Great product - hard to find in stores - great for curly frizzy hair- good price</li>
    <li> I thought the Headress leave-in conditioner would be too heavy for my thin, straight hair.  But its perfect!  Not greasy, doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair.  Its very nice.  Its the only thing I&#x27;ll use now.  I do like the new packaging, too.</li>
    <li> A standard item for me. Love this product.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about 4 years and I LOVE it!!!</li>
    <li> It keeps my hair manageable! I really discover how much I love it when I run out and realize the difference it makes.</li>
    <li> I have used this leave-in conditioner for several years.  It is great for my hair, plus it smells wonderful.  I would recommend this product to people with any type hair, but it is especially great for people who need volumizing hair products.</li>
    <li> This is NOT the same formula as in the past. It seems watered down.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost 15 years,,,, trying to locate a comparable product regardless of manufacturer.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years.  It has been great for my hair.  I am disappointed that Nexxus does not allow it to be sold in stores or beauty parlors anymore.  It is also becoming very difficult to find it on line.  It is a great product!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> The best leave-in conditioner that I have ever found in the past 10 years. It&#x27;s almost impossible to find anymore in stores or hair salons. Hopefully Nexus hasn&#x27;t stopped making it. You don&#x27;t have to waste time using a wash out conditioner after shampooing and it&#x27;s not sticky or oily like other leave-in conditioners like Paul Mitchells. It gives your hair more body and helps keep it in place especially while flying through the night if you&#x27;re a Vampire.</li>
    <li> I was looking for the original Nexxus Headress leave-in conditioner that I got years ago (one bottle lasted me a couple of years), and couldn&#x27;t find it.  I did find this product on Amazon.  It was less than I used to get for more money, but I gave it a try because I really loved the original product.  I&#x27;m happy that it does the job--with an extra benefit of added volume to my hair.  Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t have the wonderful, salon quality fragrance that the product had when it first came out.  I will keep using this product, but I sure miss the original fragrance.</li>
    <li> Only need a small dab! Keeps hair soft and manageable - but if you use too much you&#x27;ll get pancake flat hair. I&#x27;m a Nexxus girl and may or may not purchase this again. I don&#x27;t get any additional volume.</li>
    <li> Use this along with the Shampoo &amp; Conditioner for coloured hair as well as the lightweight leave in conditioner. LOVE THEM!</li>
    <li> it takes forever to get through a bottle. it&#x27;s messing up my shampoo-to-conditioner stockpile ratio.</li>
    <li> This was a great product, been using it for many years . It has been delegated from the NEXXUS product line.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, just what I expected. Onward and upward!</li>
    <li> This product is great for fine hair.  Adds volume.  It is hard to find.  Glad I could get it here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> My hair is so short I still have tons left. It works great but I won&#x27;t need any for awhile.</li>
    <li> Great leave in conditioner. Leaves hair feeling very soft.</li>
    <li> I love this product and I also like how fast it came to me</li>
    <li> I have thin but long hair. Serums often weigh my hair down making it appear even thinner. My hair is also dry &amp; frizzy &amp; a little uncontrollable. I live in the desert. To make matters worse, I was on a thyroid drug for 3 months and my hair started falling out. I don&#x27;t blow dry. I&#x27;m a product minimalist &amp; really only want to spend 10-15 seconds per day on my hair. Tops. But I still want to look socially acceptable &amp; healthy. If I didn&#x27;t have to brush this rat&#x27;s nest, I&#x27;d be in heaven. If I put a bit more than a silver dollar sized amount of this leave-in conditioner on my damp hair &amp; comb through &amp; loosely roll it in a bun before bed, my hair comes out looking healthy in the morning. Or you can do this in the morning. It performs better when coupled with a bit of a serum on the very ends &amp; when a generous amount of this conditioner is used. It doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down so you can use more. It is the best leave-in I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve tried everything. Also, I&#x27;ve discovered it&#x27;s best to let your hair air dry slightly before rolling it into a bun. Putting the bun higher on your head gives more volume. And really, make sure your hair isn&#x27;t just loose when you sleep with damp hair - you want to roll or braid it to avoid a frizzy look on the morning. Then you, like me, can have healthy looking 15-second hair regardless of what nature served you &amp; regardless of your demanding non-hair oriented schedule.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff for volume..nothing can compare</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I am pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product for fine, thinning hair.  My hair is so much more manageable with this product than any of the dozens of other products I have tried.  Do yourself a big favor - try it, you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
    <li> I want to bye the product</li>
    <li> Have used this product for a long time but wasn&#x27;t able to find it in stores any longer. It truly does provide conditioning and adds body hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and love it. But now, it&#x27;s become a &amp;#34;leave in&amp;#34; product and I&#x27;m quite disappointed. Not nearly as nice - I am aware of of it much more than the rinse-out product. Why Nexxus every fooled around with this product is beyond me. It was just perfect as it was. I&#x27;m still hunting for a good replacement.</li>
    <li> yes but it is thinner than previously  .. I tried to find nexxus headress that has a thickening leave-in but although some companies such as yours say they have it - they do not . ..</li>
    <li> Wish this still existed in stores.  Works just as I expected it to and I will continue purchasing it for as long as it is available.</li>
    <li> product seems to do what it says it will do.</li>
    <li> I have very dry hair so after shampoo and conditioner I apply this leave in conditioner and my hair is soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> amazon is the only place I can get it, and I love it-thickens fine,, flyaway strands</li>
    <li> I love this product and am sorry to hear that it&#x27;s been discontinued.........but $71.00 for an 8.5 oz tube?  NO WAY.  I&#x27;ll find something new to use.</li>
    <li> I love it! It gives my hair sooo much body! I will surely be purchasing this again. i use it once every 2 weeks with a normal wash and set.</li>
    <li> Amazing! Well be purchasing again! Makes my thin hair thick and beautiful. It&#x27;s a MUST buy ladies.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about 8 years, and it works perfectly on my fine, colored,  slightly curly hair.  It holds the curls in on those days when I want perfect hair (put it on, finger style it, and let it dry as is), and it holds the body in when I let it dry then tossle my hair into a more funky look.  One by one the retail suppliers of this product have discontinued it, so I&#x27;m delighted I can still get it through the ever reliable Amazon!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product, I have thinner hair and need some additional volume, this is a leave in volumnizer.  Helps hold my hair in place without being too stiff or greasy looking.  But the stores in my area do not carry it for some reason so when I buy it I buy several.</li>
    <li> fast shipping, and this product is amazing.  i am always hesitant to use too much conditioner on my super fine hair, but this leave in conditioner actually makes my hair fuller and thicker feeling, i love it!  worth the money, only need a dime sized amount for my long hair.</li>
    <li> made my hair nice and soft</li>
    <li> This nice and smooth but I can&#x27;t use it every day because it builds up.  My curly hair looks good for the two days I wash it, but then it gets frizzy soon thereafter.  I live in Florida so there&#x27;s much to do except to straighten hair.  Since that is not an option I will continue to use it, as it is good enough, and keep searching for another product.</li>
    <li> Perfect git on time very satisfied</li>
    <li> Best conditioner for my thick hair.  Love it, but it is very hard to find locally.  Glad it&#x27;s here.</li>
    <li> I had bought this product in Florida, but have been unable to locate in Ohio area so I tried to find it online.  I certainly was&lt;br /&gt;pleased to find it available on Amazon.  This product makes my hair more manageable and gives it more volume--I have very&lt;br /&gt;thick hair, but it never seems to go the way I want it to after sleeping on it.  This product works wonders!!</li>
    <li> Super product - can&#x27;t find it in stores anywhere anymore, but I love it!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter and I&#x27;m the one using it.  Love it, takes the place of conditioner, and leaves my hair soft.  My daughter uses it, too, but I kinda kidnapped it.</li>
    <li> This product is runny and does not easily apply to wet hair.  Makes hair very heavy and dull.</li>
    <li> Too bad this leave-in conditioner is no longer being produced. I quite love it!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I have fine, flat, thinning hair that has a bit of a wave to it. This is the only product that gives my hair back it&#x27;s life and volume.  No other product out there works !</li>
    <li> The best product, ever!</li>
    <li> So far I have been happy with it.  Most conditioners make my hair uncontrollable on the day that I wash it.  So I was looking for a leave in conditioner hoping that it would give me more body and control.  There has been some improvement.  I have some natural curl and with the summer months I have more of a hair problem.</li>
    <li> This product is so amazing! I&#x27;ve been using it for many years and I am always told how healthy my hair looks. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever stop using this product. I hope Nexxus never stops making it. It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I have very fine, thin hair and this product builds body I love it. Don&#x27;t know what i would do</li>
    <li> This really provides only a bit of volume and the cream itself is very thin and runny.  Won&#x27;t order it again,</li>
    <li> I have used this for years and love it on my  hair. I couldn&#x27;t find this locally and was so excited that I could order it online and get it shipped to me.</li>
    <li> Great product. Went crazy when my salon quit carrying it. Grocery store had it for a while, then they quit carrying it. Very pleased I found it online at Amazon. Good price too.</li>
    <li> Really like this.  Doesn&#x27;t leave hair feeling weighed down.</li>
    <li> good price, just what I needed. I have my hair straightened and need a light leave in conditioner for the ends.</li>
    <li> I have looked for this product for a long time as I had forgotten the name of the manufacturer.  When I entered it on my web page up popped exactly what I wanted on my Amazon account!  I am so pleased to have found it again and my hair is responding as it did before to this wonderful product&lt;br /&gt;Thank you again!</li>
    <li> My mom loves this stuff!</li>
    <li> This will be the 2nd tube I&#x27;ve used and I actually see a difference and have had folks tell me my hair looks thicker so in my estimation  it rates a FIVE.</li>
    <li> This Headress Lucious Volume Leave-in Conditioner is not the same as the old Headress Leave-in Conditioner that was thicker, creamier, and detangled my long wavy hair.  It was the best conditioner ever!  Now, I use Nexxus Humectress to detangle first, rinse, and then put the leave-in on.  This new formula is kind of watery but it still does a pretty good job of keeping the waves in tact and the frizz down.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used this product in years but I was going to the FL. Keys and knew my hair was going to be impossible to handle. This hair product is great for the summer time frizzes!.</li>
    <li> Works great with my hair in Florida.  Without this conditioner, I am a double for Frankenstein&#x27;s wife.  Not a great look.</li>
    <li> Headress conditioner is a fabulous product.  It acts as a styling product and a conditioner.  My hair is never stiff or sticky.  It is soft and full instead.</li>
    <li> Great product for my 90 year old mother&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;She is glad Amazon still carries it!</li>
    <li> This is the best leave-in hair conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used. Conditions your hair quickly and leaves it very soft. You don&#x27;t need a lot, so a tube lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a long time, its great.</li>
    <li> This product, with a different name (Luscious Volume Leave-In), has the identical list of ingredients as Headress Thickening Leave-In Volumizer, which, apparently, is no longer sold under that name.  Compared to the also discontinued, and much earlier product, Volumizing Leave-in Conditioner, the first three ingredients listed are identical; however, the remaining ingredients are different, although some ingredients are the same but listed in different order.  Nonetheless, all these products seem to feel and behave similarly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product very rapidly and packaged protectively but not excessively.</li>
    <li> The best conditioner in my opinion, is one that can be left in when used.  This is it, and I have used it for many years.  So thankful that AMAZON continues to make it available.</li>
    <li> a very good product I have been using for over 30 years as it is a stay in conditioner which leaves my hair very soft and manageable</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was  looking for @ a great price...</li>
