<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have bought this and Versace Pour Homme from Macy&#x27;s for the past few years. I was skeptical that these wouldn&#x27;t be authentic because they are half of the normal price. However, once I received the bottles, I compared them to the boxes and bottles I had kept from my previous Macy&#x27;s purchases. They are exactly the same and they smell exactly the same. This item and Versace Pour Homme are both 100% authentic. You have nothing to worry about. If you haven&#x27;t smelled this cologne before, it has a very light and pleasant smell. I spray it 5 times every morning. It lasts all day. Even when I wash my clothes, they still smell like the cologne. When I get out of the shower, I still smell it on my skin. I have noticed I received complements from older women.</li>
    <li> Great cologne for a great price. Smells great! Price is good. Glad I bought this. You will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> My favorite late spring/summer scent by far. Wouldn&#x27;t wear it in the colder months, but right now it&#x27;s great. Projects well, lasts all day for me, though I&#x27;ve heard from some that it doesn&#x27;t last long on their skin. A nice alternative to Bleu de Chanel. The 6.7 ounce bottle is just what I need.</li>
    <li> My husband has worn this cologne for several years. Smells really great on him and I&#x27;m very picky about what he wears. This was a great deal - especially for 6.7 ozs.</li>
    <li> Love this ! Bought for my boyfriend. . Best scent out there . Last for a long time</li>
    <li> love it!!!! honeslty the best purchase!!! its NOT toooo strong JUST perfect..if i were u i would spend the money on this PRoDuct</li>
    <li> Love the smell. Great value. I would of given this a 5 star but I wasn&#x27;t happy with how long it took to be delivered.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my grandson he loves it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great scent and a great value! Love that we have this resource for so many great products. The scent is fresh and light, definitely a favorite!</li>
    <li> Great scent great price</li>
    <li> I give this 5 stars as it is cheaper than you can buy in the stores, my husband loves it as do I!! He gets compliments on how good he smells all the time : )</li>
    <li> Resistant aromat.Made in Italy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the 3.4 oz bottle prior as my significant other worked for a well-known department store.  Smells the same, same quality.  I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on it, although due to it&#x27;s lighter scent, you might have to use nearly double the sprays as you would a more potent cologne, especially when going out on the town for a full night.  The scent is very light, very clear, very effective at putting off that good hygiene vibe women love.  Most women don&#x27;t care what you smell like as long as it&#x27;s clean.  This scent pulls it off with style!</li>
    <li> Excellent price and delivery.</li>
    <li> The price is right for what you are getting. It is in my line-up. Grown folks stuff</li>
    <li> I just received it in the mail and i want to give it as a gift from the reviews I can tell its amazing smell</li>
    <li> I recieve it on time, no probems at all.</li>
    <li> Quite satisfied. A good purchase. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> great smell.  mild but last a good while.  If you like strong smelling cologne, this one is not for you.</li>
    <li> Great product, Great Price</li>
    <li> This stuff smells amazing!  It is not a over powering smell is perfect for our family with many people who are sensitive to smells.</li>
    <li> You cant beat a deal like this...I love this cologne and the price for this bottle is worth it....shipping was great,,,no complaints at all...wearing this every day</li>
    <li> I almost don&#x27;t want to tell anyone how much I love this cologne so that no one takes my scent!  This is my 4th or 5th bottle in 4 years!  I get more compliments that anyone around.  And the price through Amazon was WAY cheaper than a department store...even more reason why I love it!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t last as long as the one I got from Sephora, the smell is extremely faint after about an hour. The smell is correct though. For half the price it&#x27;s worth it, I recommend spraying it into your clothing at the thickest parts of the fabric to maintain scent.</li>
    <li> Great cologne smell lasts a long time and it smells great what more could you ask for out of a cologne. Always get compliments on how good I smell whenever I wear this</li>
    <li> Fragrance doesn&#x27;t last for even half day. Wouldn&#x27;t be buying this cologne again.</li>
    <li> My own personal favorite. One can&#x27;t really &amp;#34;go wrong&amp;#34; when purchasing this product.</li>
    <li> You wont beat this price. Usually buy from store, it cost around $79.00 for half the size of this bottle!! Great Deal!! Will for sure order again!!</li>
    <li> This is one of my FAVORITE fragrances! PERIOD! Clean, Fresh and lasts all day without being over powering! I&#x27;m constantly having strangers tell me how nice it is &amp; asking me for the name of it! And you can get a great deal on Amazon for this product compared to other fragrances of similar class &amp; quality; about $60 for 6.75 onces &amp; one of the best bottles on the market! It&#x27;ll class up your collection!</li>
    <li> Great sweet smell vanishes quickly unless a big amount is applied but every girl loves it!!! Must buy!</li>
    <li> Probably my favorite cologne so far. I&#x27;ve bought many different types over the years, and this one gets the most compliments. Spirit Millionaire or 1million, Gucci even Acqua de Gio are not as good, and I own and love those too. Versace Men has a medium strength fragrance that lasts a long time even half a day later you can still smell the lingering cologne on your skin or clothing, but its not repulsive or strong enough to make others uncomfortable in the room, in fact you&#x27;ll most likely get a hug. My girlfriend absolutely loves when I wear it, and its definitely worth buying. Its great for both Day time and Night life.</li>
    <li> Best deals on the net.</li>
    <li> 6.8 oz bottle for the price of 3.4 oz. Every man needs this fragrance in their collection. I love it plus it was a great value!</li>
    <li> Smells great thank you!!!</li>
    <li> The product does not seem genuine...</li>
    <li> I saw this product in a sephora and came back to amazon just to check the price and it was literally HALF the price. In the store it was 95, and i got it for 50. Great value for such a designer cologne</li>
    <li> It does not last as long as the one at the store but works for now it was cheaper probably not as much whale vomit</li>
    <li> The price is awesome for what I got, I thought I was getting the smaller bottle but received the huge bottle!!</li>
    <li> First thing i done after receiving my bottle was check the batch code...&amp; i&#x27;m very happy to learn that i have a fresh bottle from 7/2014.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Versace Eau Fraiche is a light fragrance, so its not supposed to be a beast. But in hot weather it projects, &amp; people can definitely smell you..Even if you cant smell yourself. But if any of you are skeptical of your purchase...Simply check your batch code.</li>
    <li> Got it for a considerable discount (bigger than what I can see listed at the moment). For those people (like myself) who don&#x27;t get tired of the same scent every single day, this is just a perfect purchase and it will last quite some time (I hope)</li>
    <li> I am a lil skeptical and not too sure if this is the actual real/genuine product...</li>
    <li> This cologne is amazing. I have never been complimented as many times as when I wear this.</li>
    <li> 1) It is definitely genuine. 2) The 3.4oz. size has always been more potent than the 6.7oz. size.  I have been using this fragrance for years and I notice this difference in the scent&#x27;s longevity even in department store stock relevant to bottle size.</li>
    <li> would recomend this to anyone. well worth the money and lasts a descent amount of time. I havnt met a person to not like it so far.</li>
    <li> I purchased this cologne from a mall when I was living at the beach five years ago. It is one of my favorite scents, and I have received plenty of compliments over time. The cologne gives off a sweet woody scent on me, but unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t last as long as a few other colognes do on me (Lacoste Red, Polo Black, Chanel Bleu). But it still lasts a solid four hours. The reason it might not last longer might be because of how it mixes with my pheromones. Remember, colognes mix with your body&#x27;s pheromones and that alters the scent a bit. So always spray cologne on your wrist when you are shopping to see if it smells as good on you as it does on the tester strip. That all being said, I do recommend this product to friends and will buy more of it in the future.</li>
    <li> My Versace smells good my wifey loved it</li>
    <li> THANKS FOR PROVIDING US GOOD PRICE. ITS REALLY TOOO GOOD &amp; EASY TO PURCHAGE ..............................I REALLY LOVE IT...:) AMAZONE IS BEST</li>
    <li> apparent son 25 likes it as he wanted it and has not complained yet.&lt;br /&gt;Guess his GF does too.&lt;br /&gt;They are supposed to be getting back together as she is the best one he&lt;br /&gt;has brought to the house.</li>
    <li> Best spray I&#x27;ve bought, smells clean and nice</li>
    <li> Smells really really good ðŸ’¯</li>
    <li> I was very excited about getting this fragrance, but with the first spray out of the bottle, I knew it was a fake. I have bought this product in stores before and this is simply not the product advertised. I hope there is some way I can get my money back :(</li>
    <li> Love this cologne and probably will always use it!! I have been using it for 3 years and have zero regrets. I choose it over the others at all times.</li>
    <li> I had bought this in Macy&#x27;s and liked it. I&#x27;m very picky when it comes to colognes, but this one smells pretty good. When I seen the price on Amazon I had to buy it. I paid the same price at Macy&#x27;s for the 3.4oz bottle, this one is 6.7oz so it&#x27;s double the size! Great buy but try it out at your local Macy&#x27;s or other department store to see if you even like it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what has happened to this Eau De Toilette but it simply does not have the scent endurance I have previously come to expect from Versace. I have purchased this several times from local retailers and the scent would easily last all day; I really enjoyed knowing that it was there at the end of the day. I purchased this time based on price and the successful experiences I have had with Amazon. Amazon came through but either Versace has changed the formula for this product or it has been &amp;#34;watered&amp;#34; down some how. It smells like the product I have purchased before but simply doesn&#x27;t last as long as I have been accustomed to. I will try purchasing or sampling locally to confirm my experience with this latest purchase. Versace should be ashamed if they have tampered with the original formula.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t last as long as the one I got from Sephora, the smell is extremely faint after about an hour.</li>
    <li> A very nice fragrance that I&#x27;ve outgrown. I would highly recommend it for&lt;br /&gt;the gentleman who has never used it before. If you wear it off and on for&lt;br /&gt;1-2 years, you&#x27;ll get bored with it.</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff. Love it on my husband. Stays strong without being overpowering. Love that it lingers on his clothing! Worth the money and Amazon has the lowest price i have found.</li>
    <li> This cologne smells heavenly. My husband loves it and he has been approached by many people, women and men, to ask him what cologne he was wearing!</li>
    <li> I love it. The product is a huge bottle of cologne and it was sold to me at a great price.</li>
    <li> Very  well  satisfied  with  my  purchase !</li>
    <li> Do not buy....Its FAKE FAKE FAKE WATER WITH A FRAGRANCE. YOU&#x27;VE BEEN WARNED.</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume for my hubby&#x27;s bday and we love it!!!, not to mention that every body always ask him what is he wearing. My father and brother in law bought it too. Is really light but last the whole day.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t last as long as some cologne&#x27;s but it manages to pull compliments quickly  enough to where it doesn&#x27;t seem to be a problem. Definitely a fresh smell!</li>
    <li> Nice colonge. Stays on throughout the day, and seems to become prevalent as you are more active. Not overpowering, and still pleasant. The bottle is rather large and it lasts a VERY long time.</li>
    <li> This is a really good price at lease half of major box retailers.  Wife loves it!  Was like three times more else where.</li>
    <li> Every single time i have this on , i get compliments from everyone. I get asked what i have on. even by strangers</li>
    <li> Great deal, arrived quickly!  Genuine product, and smells amazing!  I was skeptical that it might be a knock off, but the cologne is very fragrant and came in original packaging.</li>
    <li> The fragrance is magnificent.The volume received for the price was great. I  have recommended this product and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> The item was a better price than department stores. This cologne smells incredible . I highly recommended for man , they will love it.</li>
    <li> Smells great for a summer time scent! I use this everyday and people love it! People ask where I got it from all the time</li>
    <li> Great Scent. My husband loves it and gets compliments all the time.</li>
    <li> Fake don&#x27;t waist your money over this.</li>
    <li> Surprised at how big the bottle actually was. This was a great value. I only wish the had some sets of it.  Quite satisfied!</li>
    <li> Let me first say I was skeptical to buy such an expensive item on amazon.  I buy this in Macy&#x27;s for 100 bucks so this offer seems too good to be true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To this day I question wether this product is real or fake. I have owned this product before from Macy&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My verdict:&lt;br /&gt;It smells like the the original, it seems to last as long as the original and it looks like original.&lt;br /&gt;So far from my use I believe it to be real. But I still can&#x27;t understand why such a low price exists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I say BUY IT. It smells like a present ocean breeze with special favors. I cannot describe it, it sort of compares to nautical brand, and such.  It has a very light smell that does not over power the smelling senses but it does overpower the urge for a female to say you smell great!&lt;br /&gt;My girlfriend LOVES it, and the girls in college all complement me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if this product were to be declared fake, it smells amazing and it lasts a good while throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;You will feel better about yourself with higher self esteem because of compliments!&lt;br /&gt;Great for casual spray!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it 4 out of 5 stars because I believe nothing is perfect and as I stated before the price is questionable.</li>
    <li> Received product in three days. Smells great but doesn&#x27;t last. Maybe it just doesn&#x27;t mix with me. Still overall good purchase.</li>
    <li> Just as expected.... only problem is, now that I&#x27;m married I can&#x27;t wear this any more.... I mean, unless my wife is out of town and I&#x27;m heading to the bar and I&#x27;m PREPARED to be swarmed by hot horny women.</li>
    <li> I love this scent, it&#x27;s the freshest of the many fragrances I own. It&#x27;s very a very light aqua, so it would be really hard to over do it with the amount of spritz you use. The scent starts getting close to the skin after about 3 hours, so in order to be noticed someone would have to be very close to you. For the short amount of time it lasts this fragrance is my favorite.</li>
    <li> usually don&#x27;t like aquatic, fresh, citrusy fragrances. But this one was a very good surprise!&lt;br /&gt; I really liked it. It&#x27;s very summery and fresh.</li>
    <li> smells good and good quality and good price</li>
    <li> This is a nice cologne that has a distinct, but subtle smell. The person who wears it interacts with people daily and it is not an overbearing smell that leaves you with a headache.</li>
    <li> I just bought this cologne  , it&#x27;s NOT AN original !!!!!! Has leaking from the top , has no smell !!</li>
    <li> I feel like that this cologne is not up to standards on strength. I had tested the fragrance in stores and it seemed much stronger and longer lasting. I suspect this product may either be too old or watered down.</li>
    <li> I got the parcel but the bottle of that perfume was in cracked position so the perfume leaks out so plz send me the new bottle or refund</li>
    <li> This cologne is really loud.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for my 16 year old son...and it really stands out.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle....is HUGE !&lt;br /&gt;This will last a man a long time...because he wont need to use much , as it smells so loud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t buy it for my husband... but for the son, mehhh....&lt;br /&gt;LOL</li>
    <li> This was not the first time I buy this cologne and definitely won&#x27;t be the last.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Amazon for their great service and awesome price!&lt;br /&gt;The scent is soft and smooth and last for a long time, always get complements when I wear it.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t go wrong with Versace... I would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> My wife chose this for me after testing many different colognes at a store. We&#x27;ve been quite happy with it, and this size (6.7oz) is about twice the size and half the cost of the one we bought from a retail outlet. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I am not a hundred percent certain this product is the real thing. This is my boyfriends favorite cologne and he has purchased the same product from Macy&#x27;s serval times, but I purchased this on a whim because the price was way cheaper. The smell of this cologne doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long as the same product bought from Macy&#x27;s. Normally, I can smell the cologne all day long, this cologne I can maybe smell for up to an hour and it is very faint. Any true Versace fan knows the true product has a very bold and lasting scent.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells amazing! I got it for my boyfriend and I&#x27;m always sniffing him now. He really likes it as well and had received so many compliments. It&#x27;s light but noticeable, slightly musky but not too much; just prefect.</li>
    <li> Everything I expected!!!</li>
    <li> Anyone looking for a signature scent should really love Versace Eau Fraiche. It&#x27;s a bit like a cross between the signature cologne created by Gianni Versace - the Versace Pour Homme which is so ocean like and fresh with under tones of musk and another wonderfully light and clean cologne, L&#x27;eau D&#x27;Issey by renowned and eclectic designer Issey Miyake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cologne is stronger than both the above but not over powering and devoid of those heavy, dreary tobacco and leather essential oil based colognes that slam people in the face. To my nose the top notes are of Amber and Musk middle notes would be citrus and cedar and it&#x27;s an elegant balance, taking the heavy notes of sage and the musk and softening them to a whisper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a unique and wonderfully inviting scent - Highest Recommendation</li>
    <li> Very good product.. also its the real deal, i compared to my last bottle... dont hesitate to purchase this, you&#x27;ll be missing out..</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift and I must say this is an amazing cologne.  It last me all day and my girlfriend LOVES IT!!!  I am getting the bigger bottle for myself when I run out of this one!</li>
    <li> This cologne is very good.  It has a soft fragrance, not loud.  You only need to spray a little on your hands and massage it on your skin.  I have received compliments about this cologne.  I am very happy that I ordered this fragrance.  I love to smell good!</li>
    <li> Husband has been wearing this cologne for years-he loves it. He was running low and I didn&#x27;t want to pay the $30 extra that Macy&#x27;s was asking so I started surfing the net to c who had a deal, this was it!  Ordered it, received the merchandise - He&#x27;s happy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is an authentic product! If it&#x27;s not it&#x27;s a really close knock off.</li>
    <li> shipping was fast bottle is huge. didnt really look at the size i guess when i ordered it. when it got here i was like wow.  big, lots of smell good.</li>
    <li> I get all the ladies now. This odor is hard to beat, which makes it even harder to beat the women off. This should have come with a stick to help defend yourself with</li>
    <li> This is probably my favorite men&#x27;s fragrance. However, I have noticed that my nose tires of it after a week or two, and I have to take a break from it. I don&#x27;t recall ever having this problem with a fragrance before.</li>
    <li> Great price, the verdict is still out as to whether or not this is 100 percent authentic, but it is close enough. It kind of has an oily feel to it but for half the price of what the stores charge, I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> I love this cologne ! Been wearing it for 6 years and amazon has the best deal anywhere</li>
    <li> Fake,maybe too old or watered down, after 2 minutes can&#x27;t smell anything, fake, don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> Very nice deal ill like it.&lt;br /&gt;thank you.</li>
    <li> It smells delicious.  I think it smells best after a couple hours of wearing it, when it&#x27;s toned down a bit, but I like subtle scents so others may like it full strength.  My husband really likes it.  Only need one squirt to smell wonderful.</li>
    <li> This is a great men&#x27;s fragrance.  I have a lot of ladies compliment me on the fragrance.  One push on the spray bottle is plenty and lasts all day.  The smaller bottle lasts about a year and the large bottle is a much better buy.  Quality product!</li>
    <li> Very good to use for a summer fragrance.</li>
    <li> Excelent product and delivery</li>
    <li> My husband is going to love this cologne, has an amazing smell.</li>
    <li> Versace made this fragrance very light,I would really wear this fragrance in the summer.Its good,not a five star.the longevity is like 4-5 hours,it does not project like a beast,and those are the downfalls of this fragrance...</li>
    <li> Great price and delivered promptly</li>
    <li> This is FAKE. I had 3 before,this one like water.DO NOT BUY YOU WILL REGRET.</li>
    <li> drives women crazy lol</li>
    <li> Very displeased with product. I&#x27;m always shopping at amazon.com. Seemed as if it was a legit company it coming from the original makers, I guess I was wrong. I&#x27;ve bought this cologne as a gift before, and the smell stuck through the whole day. This is one although has to be reminded of its scent every 2 hours. It&#x27;s horrible. I bought a Cool-Water by Davidoff, I&#x27;m more pleased with that $25 purchase. Oh yeah, didn&#x27;t know Versace was so tacky to just basically slap a sticker on the back of the bottle (not even engraved, like my previous bottle)</li>
    <li> I bought a larger bottle in hopes of havig to shop for cologne less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s is SO much weaker in smell than a smaller bottle I received as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can barely smell it after spraying it on. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s a larger bottle or just plain inconsistency in there formula. //</li>
    <li> Very happy with my purchase this was the Real deal, quality product, huge bottle, and it smells great not cheap. A+&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend</li>
    <li> Everthing it&#x27;s ok , arrive just in time in my local, the package don&#x27;t have any troubble and the price is so cheap for that reason a buy more</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very good spray , the price, the smell are just unbelievable! I&#x27;m really satisfied with the product!&lt;br /&gt;I receive a lot of compliments from a lot of people even people who doesn&#x27;t even know me when i wear it.</li>
    <li> The item came on time and was perfect</li>
    <li> I have been using Versace man for the past 4 years. I would always purchase at Nordstrom, and purchasing online had never crossed my mind due to all he knockoffs out there. With the holidays approaching, I asked my wife to get me this. I mean, it&#x27;s almost half the the price of what I normally paid for a bottle this size, so how can you go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife and I are very skeptical, and after reading some negative reviews, I almost didn&#x27;t order it. As soon as it arrived i analyzed the packaging and it all looked legit. I still have a bottle of Versace man with a little cologne left that I purchased at Nordstrom, so I did the old wrist test. I sprayed the one I ordered via Amazon on my right wrist and my old bottle on the left, after a few hours or running errands and a shower, the smell was equally as strong in both. Even now as I write this review I can still smell it lingering on both wrists. My conclusion? It&#x27;s the real deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This fragrance is very fresh yet elegant, one that can be worn during the day as well as evening. Lets not forget that we all carry fragrances different due to our own body essence, but this goes well with me. Lots of complements and quite long lasting without being overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without a doubt, one of my favorite fragrances ever made.</li>
    <li> Idk wether to buy this I feel like it&#x27;s fake or something? Idk if I should buy this??</li>
    <li> This was a great buy at an amazing price.  I got a great smelling cologne for half the department store price.  The product was in it&#x27;s original packaging and arrived on time. I hadn&#x27;t smelled it before and I took a big chance in ordering it but I &#x27;m really glad I did.  This cologne is my new favorite !!!&lt;br /&gt;It smells really good and the scent lasts all day.  I&#x27;m already begining to recieve lots of compliments from everyone.</li>
    <li> I love the smell when i got it. Now, i don&#x27;t notice it anymore, because i&#x27;m use to it. Ive had it for a couple months. Not a day goes by without someone telling me how good i smell. Seriously though. Its a great product. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> My chemistry and its fragrance work together and I have gotten random compliments on how pleasant it smells from both women and men (the layer saying I&#x27;d get a lot of women smelling that way, to which I replied, &amp;#34;I have my woman&amp;#34;  Also, this time around, its was about 50% lower in price, a big plus.</li>
    <li> This is a good scent for everyday wear, fresh and clean. I ordered the 6.7 ounce thinking it would not be the real deal- guess what, it is!</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne for my brother for last years Christmas. Over time I sprayed it on me a couple of nights that I went out and I have to tell you, I use a lot of expensive cologne and I have never received so many compliments as I do on this one. None stop compliments for how I smell sooo amazing and people always ask me what it is, even from strangers. So I eventually decided to buy it for myself and instead of 3.4 ounces I bought 6.7. Girls LOVE the smell of this cologne and also I&#x27;ve noticed many guys compliment on it as well. I would VERY much so suggest this cologne to anyone out there that is looking to smell really sexy. All I have to say is if you do buy it..get ready for some compliments.</li>
    <li> Awesome buy, smells great. Packaging and bottle were correct. Does not appear to be a knock off. Again, great gift.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cologne for sometime now. The only thing different is that this is the first time that I ordered it from Amazon. I used to think that Perfumania had some of the best deals for colognes but I got a really great deal here on Amazon. I basically got double the size that I usually get from Perfumania and ONLY $5 more. Can&#x27;t beat that!!</li>
    <li> The scent is great. It lasts a very long time even though its a fresh scent. Smells best when I&#x27;m sweating.</li>
    <li> Not the real deal AT ALL! I bought it for my boyfriend because I LOVE the way it smells. I wanted to save some money and bought this and was HIGHLY disappointed. The smell wears off within an hour, if that long. Never again. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Buy from a more reputable source.</li>
    <li> This was a great buy!  I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere cheaper!  It is the big bottle and will last my brother for a while!</li>
    <li> One of the best colognes that I have ever bought, lasts around 7-8 hours on my skin, and the projection is fairly solid. Very linear smell, maybe watch some review to make sure right for you.</li>
    <li> Nice sweet scent, easy on the nose but strong and masculine enough for men. The ladies love it, I love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn a lot of expensive cologne but I am thoroughly satisfied with this one.  It definitely has staying power and the ladies love it!!!</li>
    <li> I was a little leery purchasing this product as many have stated that it possible could be counterfeit. Got my product this morning and serial numbers match up and the fragrance is authentic! I love this cologne, it is fresh and clean and lasts on me all day, and my wife LOVES it on me. I have previously used Euphoria and this cologne smells and lasts so much better. I would recommend staying with purchasing through Amazon. They make sure that the product is the real thing! You can&#x27;t beat the price. My local shop has the 3 oz bottle for $72. This is a great cologne at a GREAT price!</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift and the recipient has been well pleased.  Have not personally used the product, but we each have our own favorites so I can fault this item.</li>
    <li> the ladies love it. not to strong and the smell last for ever!</li>
    <li> First off I just wanted to state that I bought this completely blindly going only on the fact that it was made by Versace.  That being said I only ordered the smallest bottle in case I really didn&#x27;t like it but now I kind of wish I&#x27;d gotten a larger size! This stuff is amazing! The first time I put it on I had to PRY my girlfriend off of me! Its gota very clean, refreshing scent to it. I&#x27;m no expert on all the different, subtle nuances and notes that make a cologne smell the way out does but I would say this may fall into the musk-y category but only slightly. ÃŽ mean it&#x27;s not citrusy so... to me it kind of reminds me ofa cleaner, lighter, less musky version of blue jeans.I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and smell so good, and is a good price for this perfume I will buy other</li>
    <li> Every time I go out, I put this on and no matter where I go, some woman at some bar always comments about it. trust me, this stuff is AMAZING.</li>
    <li> Bought this for husband and hmm I LOVE it! It is a great price, delivery was actually faster than what they said it would be!! I recommend!</li>
    <li> product smells like it was mixed with more alcohol and looses scent faster than an original Versace.</li>
    <li> I love this cologne. The scent is fresh and clean, a few sprays will last the day. People usually ask what it is I&#x27;m wearing and for the price of the bigger bottle it&#x27;s a steal in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;A &amp;#34;tip&amp;#34; I tell my friends is to spray it sparingly on their shirts/jackets, it makes the scent carry further if they&#x27;re going out or just want a little extra scent. Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 5 years. I love it.</li>
    <li> great price for all this good juice!!!</li>
    <li> Smelled nice but will not last long</li>
    <li> I give it a 5 star... its looks just like the one i bought from macy&#x27;s and the bottle looks exactly the same so i think its authintic to me, I recommend yall trying this.... it smells awesome ;) i get alot of compliments from alot of girls, and it last on me for about 6 hours on my skin and clothes so yea i give it a 5...</li>
    <li> This scent is very nice. It works for everybody! This smells best in the summer because it is very light and will be just the right touch in hot weather. Would recommend to anybody looking for a summer scent. Also very underpriced on Amazon compared to sephora!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t miss fragrance.  Excellent value.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my brother as a birthday gift, he likes it because it is mild and relatively inexpensive..</li>
    <li> Legitimate product, not a counterfeit. And one of my favourite scents. Long wearing, very aromatic and a touch on the sweet side. If you like armani aqua de gio etc you&#x27;ll like this. Also great value, huge bottle for 40 dollars.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted this and when I got it, no regret at all. Loved it every second I smelt it.</li>
    <li> My husbands favorite and such a great price</li>
    <li> First off, this is my absolute favorite cologne for my husband.  I have been making him wear this for the last 3 years.  It isn&#x27;t heavy, but it is strong enough that you will smell it throughout the day and even on your clothes after you have washed them.  It is a very clean smell - which I love! I don&#x27;t like dark, musky colognes. And *VERY IMPORTANT* (because I was skeptical): THIS IS THE REAL DEAL!  I was scared because I saw that a couple of other reviews stated that this was a fake.. but when it came in, I sprayed it in my office just to see if I could tell right away if it wasn&#x27;t legit, and it was in fact the real thing!  When I came into work today I could still smell it at my desk (where I sprayed it the day before) and it smells delicious, just like my husband. ;)</li>
    <li> My husband loves this cologne and this is by far the cheapest and best place to buy it!</li>
    <li> The product was everything I wanted.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite colognes, great clean scent.  A classic and will always have a place in my collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot imagine anyone being disappointed with this cologne, and I constantly get complements on it when I wear it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It&#x27;s a huge bottle and smells wonderful.  You won&#x27;t go wrong with making this purchase. Excellent!</li>
    <li> First off, I find it laughable that the negative reviewers complained this cologne is watered down. The bottle is labeled Eau Fraiche, so if you do your research you will know that out of the 4 levels of dilution, Eau de Fraiche is the most diluted (followed be Eau de Cologne, Eau de Toilette, and Eau de Parfum being the strongest, least diluted). I love this cologne for my husband because it is Eau Fraiche...there&#x27;s nothing worse (for woman anyway) than choking on a man&#x27;s cologne because it is way too strong. This scent is light and affords you the pleasure of spraying yourself a couple times without \\&quot;overdosing\\&quot;. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Any man fortunate enough to have discovered this cologne knows this is some nice smelling stuff.  The most obvious/noticeable aspect of this scent is the citrus; it&#x27;s distinctly grapefruity.  Underneath the scent of citrus is a woody quality, with a deep, clean, aquatic finish.  Definitely \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; smelling, but not sharp on the nose; it&#x27;s extremely pleasant and the smell lingers nicely.  I can tell you positively that women LOVE this cologne and men frequently ask me what scent I&#x27;m wearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing about this fragrance is that it&#x27;s versatile.  I could wear this every day to work, although this is best worn on a date, especially during the day.  Probably \\&quot;more\\&quot; appropriate in the sunshine or in the summer, but totally wearable otherwise.  And as an added bonus, not a lot of guys wear this stuff.  It&#x27;s not like Chrome, Cool Water, Light Blue, Jean-Paul Gauthier, Drakkar Noir and Eternity, which seemingly every guy has.  A lot of guys seem to be ditching Acqua di Gio (which also is a best-seller but, in my opinion, for good reason; I think it is one of the best, if not THE best, smelling scents out there) because it doesn&#x27;t last long and a lot of dudes wear it, including high school and frat boys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a replacement signature scent, I would strongly suggest that you consider this one.  A tad more acute and citrus smelling than Acqua, but again, nice and pleasant and DEFINITELY lasts longer, if you&#x27;re worried about that.  LOVE Versace Eau Fraiche!</li>
    <li> This was my first legit cologne purchase for myself, and my expectations were set high after reading a lot of the customer reviews. When I received the delivery, I noticed how carefully the item was packaged -- this was a plus. After opening it up, I sprayed once or twice on my chest and wrist to &amp;#34;get a taste&amp;#34; of the scent. There are some users claiming that the cologne comes on strong and lasts long. By strong I think it means how well you, and others, can smell the fragrance, right? Well, that&#x27;s not what I got. I thought my nose was plugged at first, but it&#x27;s really hard for me to pick up the scent unless I tilt my head down to smell what I sprayed on my chest. I wave my wrist around and I can barely smell it unless it&#x27;s up close to my face. Do I need to spray it 4 or 5 times on a particular area so others can smell it? I asked a friend to stand next to me, and she didn&#x27;t notice a thing until I swung my wrist in front of her face (lol). I highly doubt Amazon would accept a return on an open cologne bottle, but holy moly. There goes $67 *insert sad face*</li>
    <li> instant classic, this turns heads every time i weat it. it is kind of light but it lasts on the skin all day and night</li>
    <li> Was not packaged right and it came broken and cracked. I had to go to the mall and buy the same product . It was for a birthday present. It was a very big inconvenience.! Watch out when buying from this seller.</li>
    <li> Got it for 50 dollars that is a steal love the smell of Versace and so does my lady. GREAT deal</li>
    <li> my boyfriend absolutely loves this cologne. he always recieves compliments</li>
    <li> This fragrance ALWAYS gets me compliments. I love the smell.</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s my issue... this has ZERO staying power as a scent. I purchased some smaller versions that seemed to be better, but this large size is basically scented water. BOOOOOOOO.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s huge! Should last a loong time. My girlfriend loves it too.</li>
    <li> I got the set of the body wash, cologne, and after shave from Macy&#x27;s a few years back and it cost me probably around $100 bucks or so (and when I got it from Macy&#x27;s they only give you the smaller bottle, not the big gulp bottle like this one)...but hold on a minute...they gave me a free travel bag that was probably worth at least a whopping $15-20 with my expensive purchase, so who is laughing now. (Probably Macy&#x27;s)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved this cologne from the first time I bought it and when I ran out of it I wanted more.  Thankfully for Amazon had it for much cheaper then Macy&#x27;s and I was excited for it and to wear it.  I love this cologne and it is one of my favorites and would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> My friend really loves this fragrance and appreciated getting this gift.</li>
    <li> Very nice item for my husband</li>
    <li> Every time I wear this product there are so many people who comment.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this! It&#x27;s diluted. My girlfriend who has experience with Versace says it&#x27;s too light. I have worn it and the smell was completely gone within two hours. Too bad I can&#x27;t return it. Don&#x27;t waste your money and buy from a better reputable source like Saphora.</li>
    <li> Very big! Very nice. My husband like it :)&lt;br /&gt;It smells great too; I would recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;FYI it is really big.</li>
    <li> excellent and delivered on time</li>
    <li> FAKE FAKE FAKE! IMITATION!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why people say its a fake product. It&#x27;s sold directly by amazon and I hardly doubt they would sell anything fake.  I am happy with it and you get a lot for what you pay. For instance my local perfume shops sell have a bottle for the same price</li>
    <li> I smelled this scent in a magazine and fell in love and needed to purchase it for my husband. We ordered from Amazon and were pleased with the quick shipping. Totally worth the money!</li>
    <li> Excellent price. High quality cologne. Smells wonderful. My son was beyond happy. He buys a lot of cologne. The big size !!</li>
    <li> I love this smell. It is seriously my favorite men&#x27;s cologne. Too bad it is so expensive, but I think it is worth it. It came very fast and was undamaged. Overall a good buy!</li>
    <li> If your are a cologne addict like myself this is a must get item for Christmas. I just got this cologne and i am loving it.</li>
    <li> I like it smells!!! GoodðŸ‘Œ</li>
    <li> If you want girls to ask you what that wonderful smell is and be able to say its you then buy this fragrance.  Get it from amazon itself or you might get a fake so ive heard.  The big bottle is a steal at 60 some dollars.  Its will last forever.  I love this fragrance.</li>
    <li> The item arrived just fine but began to leak a day later while still in the box...had to be a faulty product.</li>
    <li> Product was exactly what it says. Large bottle, smells great, good price, defiantly will buy more when it runs out!</li>
    <li> Very good smelling cologne. This is a very cool and fresh fragrance. Great for people who DON&#x27;T like strong or musky smells. Great Price!</li>
    <li> Super low price!  I was very pleased with my purchase and the transaction.</li>
    <li> Cheaper than the store but quality is not cheap.</li>
    <li> My son loved it, especially since it was such a huge bottle. The price was really good and more so when there was no taxes, or any shipping and handling.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t determine if it&#x27;s fake or not as the fragrance only last up to 4 hours.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments - most thing it&#x27;s Acqua Di Gio though.</li>
    <li> i chose this frangance ,,,because it is smooth...HAVE USED ANOTHER FRANGANCE FOR OVER 15 YEARS...NEEDED A CHANGE ....Man Eau De Toilette Spray Men by &amp;#34;Versace&amp;#34; 6.7 Ounce was the best choice after searching for over a year...wdo</li>
    <li> Not the real stuff, the scent/smell doesn&#x27;t last long at all. It&#x27;s cheap and not worth it!</li>
    <li> Great smell I like to mix on with my body spay creating a invigorating aroma.</li>
    <li> Great product at a fantastic price. My girlfriend can&#x27; keep her paws off of me when ever I&#x27;m wearing this.</li>
    <li> I got a sample card of this cologne and liked it a lot. The best price was on Amazon and it appears to be authentic with regard to packaging, bottle, etc.&lt;br /&gt;As some other reviewers have stated it does not seem to last very long. Two to three hours at most, I&#x27;ve had other cologne&#x27;s that lasted much longer but this one has a lighter, fresher scent, so maybe that&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;Very clean scent that has presence but won&#x27;t over power. I&#x27;ve had several women ask me what I was wearing and with most of the colognes I&#x27;ve had maybe one or two would ask, so this one gets the ladies attention better than some!</li>
    <li> Though the bottle was huge, the scent does not last - maybe its not the real thing?? I will not buy again.</li>
    <li> The product arrived quickly and the price was exceptional!! I am very pleased with the quality and the prices can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
    <li> Loved it, strong smell stays on for long time.</li>
    <li> Great Fragrannce but the spray head stopped working only after a week :/</li>
    <li> Ladies,  if you like your man smelling fresh and sexy, choose this one. Can&#x27;t keep my hands off my husband when he wears it. Guys: the scent is fresh, clean and masculine. Not overpowering, but it lasts a good, long while.</li>
    <li> This cologne is tied for #1 in my collection along with Vera Wang for men. Makes me smell like new money!!!! I would reccomend these two above any other.</li>
    <li> This is not MAN it is disgusting cheap drugstore cologne, do not buy this stuff stinks big time</li>
    <li> man, a huge amount of cologne for the price... highly recommended... amazing smell as well...</li>
    <li> It has a soft scent that women love.</li>
    <li> I love this purchase and will continue to order again. The savings are great and can be seen. I&#x27;m a happy customer.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the real deal!! Took a glanced at the price,  then I said oh WTH whY not!  I&#x27;ve been using the Versace Signature for years and still is my FAVORITE, but this one here  is no doubt my choice as a daily fragrance. The fresh  light scent is just perfect during day.</li>
    <li> bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it, his friends are jealous. it smells amazing and the bottle is huge. I would definitely recommended it.</li>
    <li> I been using this perfume for over a year. I used to buy it from Macy&#x27;s and I loved it so did my wife. I wanted to save some money buying it from Amazon. I regret that. ITS FAKE NOT The Real perfume. The smell disappears in 10 minutes. I Thing that Amazon does not check the sellers sources. Its a big scam going on and I wrote to the manufactures about it and they are looking into it..</li>
    <li> Really big bottle of quality cologne, smells great and the smell lasts.</li>
    <li> my boyfriends favorite cologne! usually I spend more on a smaller bottle.. was pleasantly surprised how large the bottle is:)</li>
    <li> This is 100 percent authentic and is at a great price. It smells great and everyone compeliments the bottle and the &amp;#34;Versace&amp;#34; style</li>
    <li> This cologne smells amazing.  I&#x27;m very picky on the colognes I buy and this one has gotten the most compliments so far.  It lasts for about 4 hours, so I&#x27;d buy a smaller bottle for work.</li>
    <li> I should say this is one of the best Colognes. Girls love it too. Smells really good. Thinking of buying another one in the future.</li>
    <li> This cologne  is amazing smells great don&#x27;t listen to any negitive feed back!  Buy it its totally worth it! Thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;mchoosing this rating because i like the products i&#x27;m berry happy with my items I am satisfied with my purchase, exceeded my expectations,&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> Very exotic and interesting smell.</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne as a gift and the person loved it. It&#x27;s definitely worth the price and it smells great! The price you pay for this bottle is the price you pay for the small bottle in any retail store. Amazon is great!</li>
    <li> This was a gift requested by my brother in law. He loves this scent.</li>
    <li> This cologne was from a batch made in 2007 so not only is it old but the smell lasts for about 5 minutes. I have no doubt this is authentic but when it&#x27;s 8 years old it hardly does its job.</li>
    <li> Smells great my wife is always complementing me on how good I smell!!</li>
    <li> Fake don&#x27;t buy!!! I bought 2 of them and it doesn&#x27;t last  I want my money back</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband for Christmas.  He just recently started using it, and we have used this product before but this barely has any smell and seems like it&#x27;s watered down or something.  Will not be purchasing from here again.</li>
    <li> Absolutely awesome! Smells fresh, crisp and exotic. Something you want to throw on for a day around town or for a cool night out. I&#x27;d recommend this to ANY guy looking for a new cologne.</li>
    <li> really great value for price</li>
    <li> what a great deal. I bought a bottle half this size for more at the department store.</li>
    <li> The real deal! Had a bottle from Dillard&#x27;s still to compare it to and no doubt in my mind this is 100% Authentic &amp; Fresh!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will most certainly be a repeat customer!  Would Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I saw a add for this in my cosmo and had the boyfriend smell it and we both loved it and had to buy it! If we were going to buy it we had to get the bigest bottle so we bought this one. It did take a long time to ship though (almost 4 weeks to get to us) but we love the smell so much we got over that. Great great smell!</li>
    <li> I really couldn&#x27;t believe how large this bottle was. This is a great value for a fantastic cologne. My girlfriend really loves it when I were it!</li>
    <li> This is a great, light scent.  It lasts so long and develops throughout the day.  It smell different in the evening than it did in the morning after applying but the lasting scent is so delightful.  I would say this would be best for summer, or warmer weather; but it also is not out of place in the frigid temperatures of Idaho either.  This was a great addition to my cologne arsenal.</li>
    <li> This was a gift and very economical compared to the department store price. My husband loves this fragrance and it is not too overpowering so I enjoy it as well.</li>
    <li> Great cologne just received today and its exactly like my old one from Macy&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> smells good. nice product</li>
    <li> This is an amazing cologne, I wear it almost everyday, it stays for really long time, and I really get a lot of compliments on it. It smells amazing. It is a must to have in your collection. I would totally recommend this one to everyone.</li>
    <li> Smells as strong as the ones i bought from the mall, good stuff!!!! My girl loves it too :)</li>
    <li> Bought for a friend after his ran out, he had others but none that compared to this one. We are both in love with it</li>
    <li> Boya Boy...I&#x27;m really confuse??? I bought that cologne from Amazon...&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not really sure it was the real thing???!!! it was soo weak compare what I had before....</li>
