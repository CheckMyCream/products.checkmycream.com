      <li>Great price - a fraction of Canada based prices; very rapid delivery; very satisfied</li>
      <li>Love love love this product!</li>
      <li>love it, would not use mascara without it</li>
      <li>Love that i got three bottles for the price.</li>
      <li>I use a dryer one as my top coat</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
      <li>It works better with a thinner mascara though.</li>
      <li>Better product than the one they sell on one of those home shopping clubs.</li>
      <li>AND WITH MORE VOLUME.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The lash extender worked pretty good on my lashes.</li>
      <li>so now I just have 2 perfect bottles just sitting there and $30 down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It stays on very well and makes my eyelashes look nice and full.</li>
      <li>so that was cool.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s not bad for the price.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s pretty easy to use</li>
      <li>Looks more like real lashes than many of the long lash mascaras.</li>
      <li>I dont know if im using it right</li>
      <li>even if you do it right?</li>
      <li>I use a red and white tube from Loreal and they go great together.</li>
      <li>They make your eyelashes look considerably longer but the product gets everywhere and it tends to come off easily.  </li>
      <li>but I finally really like what it does for my lashes!</li>
      <li>really works!</li>
      <li>very desapoint thank you very much</li>
      <li>really makes your lashes thicker</li>
      <li>and  the shipping was fast .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Really adds volume.</li>
      <li>Really makes my lashes much longer than with just mascara.  </li>
      <li>Kind of messy, but clean up is easy and my lashes are incredibly long, so the mess is worth it.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t remember so many fibers falling under my eyes thru the day making me look like I had dark circles.  </li>
      <li>If your looking for a cheep way to enhance your eyelashes without fakes this is a decent product to use.</li>
      <li>Use a lash curler first, have the mascara and the lash extender open and then apply, mascara first, extender, mascara to seal</li>
      <li>, I do this technique two times, wow results!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it in the past from QVC, but they don&#x27;t carry it anymore, so I was glad to find a source for it.</li>
      <li>Need to work fast, don&#x27;t let the mascara dry, yes some will fall to the bottom lid but just brush off with a soft brush.  </li>
      <li>I really like this fiberlash enhancer, it doesn&#x27;t spill onto your face like some other brands do.</li>
      <li>it bothered me so much and my eye got all red and looked like I had pink eye just because it was so irritated...</li>
      <li>You have to really keep your head down.</li>

<li> You have to really keep your head down.</li>
<li> The product is not what expected it was  dry and look old product .im</li>
<li> THE ONLY THING IS THAT ONCE DRY AND ADHERED TO YOUR LASHES,</li>
<li> Not perfect but better than any other I have tried.</li>
<li> Give you long lashes.</li>
<li> However, I didn&#x27;t hold my head down enough to look in the mirror and some of the fibers got into my eyes, and I had to rinse my eyes out.</li>
<li> Now that I have it down, it not only makes my lashes look longer, they look fuller and thicker!</li>
<li> I tried to use it as directed, but had a total mess.  </li>
<li> VIA WET MASCARA</li>
<li> But if you have thin lashes, it won&#x27;t really make a difference.</li>
<li> Also, I blow off the brush before applying it so that I have minimal drop off on my face.</li>
<li> I am giving this four stars instead of five because the black does fall down on your face, so you have to be very careful applying it.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s kinda messy and it gets in the eyes but other than that its extends lashes.</li>
<li> I took the product to a friend who does make-up for functions and she thought it was a mess too.</li>
<li> It takes a little practice</li>
<li> Once those little fibers get I to your eye</li>
<li> but its a little clumpy but does make your eyelashes longer!</li>
<li> I was using a thick one with it</li>
<li> A little disappointed, hope my clients don&#x27;t return this product for a refund.</li>
<li> /&gt;However, it lost serious brownie points by being so annoying!</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s way too annoying if it gets in your eye</li>
<li> This product is horrible.  </li>

    <li> This product is horrible.  I tried to use it as directed, but had a total mess.  If you wear contacts, forget it.  I took the product to a friend who does make-up for functions and she thought it was a mess too.</li>
    <li> I cannot go out without applying this.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of years and it&#x27;s great.  Really adds volume. Try it... I&#x27;m sure you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Great price - a fraction of Canada based prices; very rapid delivery; very satisfied</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  Really makes my lashes much longer than with just mascara.  I&#x27;ve used it in the past from QVC, but they don&#x27;t carry it anymore, so I was glad to find a source for it.</li>
    <li> It takes a little practice but I finally really like what it does for my lashes! It works better with a thinner mascara though. I was using a thick one with it and it got too clumpy.  Now that I have it down, it not only makes my lashes look longer, they look fuller and thicker! I&#x27;m very happy with this product :)</li>
    <li> Been using it for quite some time. Looks more like real lashes than many of the long lash mascaras.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t remember so many fibers falling under my eyes thru the day making me look like I had dark circles.  I used plenty of mascara before, and after to seal the fibers.  A little disappointed, hope my clients don&#x27;t return this product for a refund.</li>
    <li> Once you get the hang of it you will have the most awesome lashes.  Need to work fast, don&#x27;t let the mascara dry, yes some will fall to the bottom lid but just brush off with a soft brush.  My lashes never looked so good.  Better product than the one they sell on one of those home shopping clubs. Go for it, you will be thrilled with the results.

    <li> I am giving this four stars instead of five because the black does fall down on your face, so you have to be very careful applying it. That said, it does work great. Just be sure the mascara you use is fairly sticky before applying it. I use a dryer one as my top coat so it doesn&#x27;t smear. Also, I blow off the brush before applying it so that I have minimal drop off on my face.</li>
    <li> Love that i got three bottles for the price. I dont know if im using it right but its a little clumpy but does make your eyelashes longer! &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! My lashes look fully and bigger. I love it!!!!!</li>
    <li> They make your eyelashes look considerably longer but the product gets everywhere and it tends to come off easily.  I find myself having to reapply it a lot and sometimes it gets into the crease of my eyelids but it&#x27;s not bad for the price. If your looking for a cheep way to enhance your eyelashes without fakes this is a decent product to use.</li>
    <li> I really like this fiberlash enhancer, it doesn&#x27;t spill onto your face like some other brands do. It stays on very well and makes my eyelashes look nice and full.</li>
    <li> love it, would not use mascara without it</li>
    <li> THE ONLY THING IS THAT ONCE DRY AND ADHERED TO YOUR LASHES, VIA WET MASCARA, IT FLAKES OFF,  GETTING INTO YOUR EYES, AND MAKING YOUR VISION BLURRY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INITIALLY IS AWESOME AND MAKES YOUR EYELASHES APPEAR THICKER, AND WITH MORE VOLUME.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BY THE END OF THE WORK DAY, (8 hours), MY EYES WERE SCREAMING FOR  EYE DROPS, TO COMBAT ALL OF THE FLAKES FROM THIS PRODUCT THAT WERE IN MY EYES.</li>
    <li> The lash extender worked pretty good on my lashes. I can tell a difference as opposed to just putting on regular mascara. However, I didn&#x27;t hold my head down enough to look in the mirror and some of the fibers got into my eyes, and I had to rinse my eyes out. You have to really keep your head down. It is just trial and error until you master it.</li>
    <li> Works great depending on the mascara you use. I use a red and white tube from Loreal and they go great together. Otherwise it gets sort of clumpy and doesn&#x27;t extend as well.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT !!!! it&#x27;s kinda messy and it gets in the eyes but other than that its extends lashes. But if you have thin lashes, it won&#x27;t really make a difference.</li>
    <li> really makes your lashes thicker</li>
    <li> love it! really works!</li>
    <li> I gave this thing 2 stars&lt;br /&gt;1 star is for the fact that yes...this product does work.&lt;br /&gt;2. Yes the lashes look good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it lost serious brownie points by being so annoying! Once those little fibers get I to your eye there&#x27;s no getting them out...it bothered me so much and my eye got all red and looked like I had pink eye just because it was so irritated...take an eyelash in your eye x&#x27;s 5---it hurts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the combo pack because it was a bigger bang for my buck...but that can only happen if you actually USE the product...the second that happened with my eye I stopped using it so now I just have 2 perfect bottles just sitting there and $30 down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried contacting the seller or anything, but still...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So--yes this does technically lengthen your lashes...but it&#x27;s way too annoying if it gets in your eye and it HURTS....even if you do it right? Throughout the day the fibers fall off onto your cheek and when you wipe them away they smudge mascara on your face...so that was cool.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best way to have great lashes.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty easy to use and  the shipping was fast .&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love love love this product! It does take some getting used to but it is wonderful if you know what you are doing</li>
    <li> This extender actually thickens which is what I wanted. Not perfect but better than any other I have tried.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful if you have thinning eyelashes</li>
