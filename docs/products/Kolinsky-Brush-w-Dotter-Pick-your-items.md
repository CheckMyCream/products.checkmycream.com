<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not cheapo, this brush will last. Had a fine tapered edge and it is the perfect size for doing a french nail or cleaning up messy edges. Good sturdy bristles, nice size dotting tool. Also it came very fast</li>
    <li> This is the best bush I have used for french nail.  I recommend this to any one who wants to make a pecfect french.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, the brush is a little too stiff, making difficult to clean around the nail. however considering the price it fits the purpose, but be very careful and precise when using it.</li>
    <li> Quality made brush with nice stiff bristles. If you paint your own nails, this is a must have for cleanup. The stiffness isn&#x27;t too stiff tho, you can make perfect smiles or half moons with this. It&#x27;s got perfect weight, it feels solid in your hand,  Love mine.</li>
    <li> Great tool for fixing nail polish mistakes and also for nail art</li>
    <li> good for french manicure, white line application</li>
    <li> Very nice large sturdy shaping brush. Perfect for the middle finger and thumb. Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> This is a great tool.  The brush is very even and works like a charm.  I&#x27;m new to doing my own gel nails, but this really made my life easy.  It works really well and didn&#x27;t take me long to get used to.  Great buy.</li>
    <li> This product is light weight and small just the right tool. Love, the feel of this nail tool and perfect for nail french tip with the brush. The brush is soft and playable for any job with nail gel or acrylics. The other part with the tip is great for making designs to perfection. This is a needed tool for any nail job, unlike other tools that dont have a double ended nail tool.</li>
    <li> This is the best French Manicure nail brush I have ever owned! I am a salon professional and go through many nail tools &amp; brushes often, however this one is a high quality brush. I have not experienced any bristles fraying and it still looks like new after 5 months of use. It makes doing French tips super fast and easy... I&#x27;d say so easy that you don&#x27;t have to be a salon professional to do it, but will stand the test of time if you are a professional using it daily on clients. If cleaned and cared for properly, this brush will not disappoint! I will not use any other brush for French manicures on my clients or myself again!</li>
    <li> I really love this brush.  The only downfall is that after some use the bristles start to fall off.</li>
    <li> Not bad, I was wanting a little shorter bristols and harder.</li>
    <li> I love this brush.It is high quality and it goes smooth on the nails. I feel like a professional when I use it, and the dotter is perfect.</li>
    <li> Perfect for easy cleanup! Honestly, nothing beats a Kolinsky brush when cleaning up your nails after painting or doing art. The brustles do not break down with repeated use of acetone. The bristles don&#x27;t come out like I&#x27;ve had with other brushes. It&#x27;s so easy to make a clean line and your nails look great!</li>
    <li> The brush works great as it should and leaves no residue.  It feels comfortable on my hands.  Finally, a brush worth buying.</li>
    <li> I had brought this to clean up my nails when I paint them myself. Being that I have a hard time painting my nails myself and always get polish around the edges. So I brought this to clean up the excess polish and I have used it numerous times now and it&#x27;s a great tool to have have for at home manicures.</li>
    <li> She is my new best friend. Love it how it cleans the top of the nail bed by the cuticle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been doing my own gel nails for quite a while; but I&#x27;ve always struggled with the smile line.  This made it so much easier!  Wish I had found and purchased this a long time ago.</li>
    <li> I have been looking at this product for a while and I decided to buy it and I am pleased with it!The shipping was fast and I will be ordering&lt;br /&gt;this again!</li>
    <li> Works really good as a clean up brush not sure about French tip haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it for that but totally worth the price</li>
    <li> I am not a pro but I used this brush to clean the edges of my nails. Works so well! I highly recommend this for your basic bail tools. The brush is really high quality. When it&#x27;s wet with remover, the bristles are smooth and don&#x27;t separate. Love it</li>
    <li> The brush works very well if you want to do French Manicure, but the other end of the nail brush is useless.</li>
    <li> Mine came in the mail missing the detail portion. The brush is still nice quality ao i will keep it, but im glad i got this on sale. Now i need to go buy detail pens or find another brush like this one. This time at my local Sally&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used this to clean up french tip lines yet but I&#x27;m a licensed nail tech and have loved this brush for cleaning up around the cuticle of my shellac manicures. The dotting tool works equally as well as other tools you can purchase, the real hero here is the brush. Bristles are firm with just the right about of give and they don&#x27;t splay outwards when you put pressure on them. Love it!</li>
    <li> I am a rank amateur at doing my own French manicure, but this brush has really saved my sanity.  I&#x27;ve gotten better at applying the polish, but it&#x27;s this brush that makes the finished polish wearable.  I tried a number of other, finer brushes because I couldn&#x27;t understand at first how a thicker one could produce a fine line.  I finally figured out that I should swipe in circular motions to get the edge *just right* - and now I&#x27;m so pleased to be able to do my own gel manicures.  If you don&#x27;t get it at first, keep trying and watch some YouTube vids - this brush really is the best tool for the job.</li>
    <li> Love this tool for doing my french manicures...it does exactly what I wanted it to do - would highly recommend</li>
    <li> Perfect for nail clean up or making white tips for French manicures. Dab in acetone, tap off on a towel, then use it barely damp to clean up nail polish or make a white tip. To do this put on a layer of white over the nail tip - don&#x27;t be perfect. Then use this brush with a very small amount of acetone to wipe over the excess - side to side, to create a crescent tip.</li>
    <li> Not as how I expected and didn&#x27;t help me with my french at all. The bristles were cut unevenly too</li>
    <li> Thank you for your shipping soon actually this product I love helps me a lot to use that I&#x27;m giving it. I recommend this product is of very good quality.</li>
    <li> The brush is so handy when doing French tip manicures, especially for beginners. plus it has a dotter, now that&#x27;s just perfect.</li>
    <li> I love this tool. It helps me create such nice french manicures. The bristles stay firm. I&#x27;ve already used it 3 times since it arrived and it&#x27;s still working perfectly. Great quality brush.</li>
    <li> I got this brush for do-it-myself French manicures. It&#x27;s has sturdy brush and a nice handle. The shipping is fast and the product is as described. I would recommend the seller and the product.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush to use for doing gelish french manicures. It creates a perfect smiley line for the french tips. Very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> This brush is worth the $$ I paid for it.  It creates the best smile line for French manicures.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used on customer yet but I think it&#x27;s good</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used the dotting tool much. Does work well though!  I bought another one do the reviews will be the same. Bristles are kinda wide so be careful. However, they are nice and flat which is great for clean ups. The come clean easily and I live em.</li>
    <li> I got this brush to do my own French Manicure with shellac. It works great. One smooth swoop and it gives a perfect smile line.</li>
    <li> Ok, alittle on the small side and very expensive for what they are</li>
    <li> very nice brush work great real kolinsky hair recommend to any one will buy again</li>
    <li> This is a very high-quality brush, and the dotting tool, of course, does just what it is designed to do! What I need a brush to do for French nails on gel polish, though, this brush is not right for. Or perhaps, it&#x27;s my skills which aren&#x27;t right for the French manicures I&#x27;m doing--and this brush could help--I hope I&#x27;m not downgrading it wrongly. In any case, I prefer to stick with the $1 elf professional concealer brush from Target, bought more than one at a time, to swipe the smile line for gel French manicures with alcohol, and clean up regular polish with acetone. Other peoples&#x27; training from fancy instructors may be superior, but this high-quality brush is just too big to find a use around my polish station.</li>
    <li> I wish this brush was my boyfriend. Dependable, strong, yet gentle enough to make perfect French ;) If you have not mastered the one stroke french or for general clean up...this is the brush to use.</li>
    <li> Good quality for the money. Shipped very quickly. I&#x27;m very happy with the product and I would buy it again</li>
    <li> This brush is easy to use; doing a French manicure is so simple with it. The brush creates perfect half moons, and though it took me a little while to figure it out, the other end is super useful for making dots or other patterns. The end result was as if a professional had done my nails. I&#x27;ll be doing my nails at home a lot more often now that I have this brush - I totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> They sent me a different brush than in the photo, it doesn&#x27;t have a dotting tool and is large and round, not the flat curve I wanted for  a french manicure.  I&#x27;ll return it and may update my review if the issue is dealt with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:  They sent me a label to return the wrong item and sent the new item quickly.  It looks like a good product, sturdy enough, so I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought it to clean up my nail polish mistakes, it works great. I love it! It&#x27;s a bit pricey tho.</li>
    <li> My nail tech instructer had this brush in her collection and when i used it i fell in love! Perfect for round the edge clean up applying acrylic and the dotting tool is perfect for flowers!!</li>
    <li> This nail brush is exactly what I was looking for. The bristles are firm, making the medium easy to manipulate. The pick is incorporated which makes the corners and edges east to clean and straighten. I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
    <li> This brush worked out very well -- I use it for at-home french manicures, as well as to clean up the edges of my nails and cuticles when I do a sloppy job of painting them or am using darker colors.  For someone who isn&#x27;t the most steady-handed, this is a real help.</li>
    <li> So far, so good.  Have used it about 6 times thus far and have been pleased with the result and quality.</li>
    <li> This nail brush is easy to use and a great product for the professional or for someone who does nails at home.</li>
    <li> I wish I would&#x27;ve known such a thing existed long ago!!  This brush is amazing.  I&#x27;ve used it several times now.  The lines are so clean, the appearance is similar to getting gel nails when they use the metal &amp;#34;pink cutter&amp;#34; in the salon.  I gave myself a pink glitter french today.  Buy this brush today and save yourself a lot of frustration, it does a gorgeous job!  And you can effortlessly clean the paint off your skin also.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for with quick delivery.</li>
    <li> Helps so that I can clean up the &amp;#34;smile&amp;#34; line.  Does what it is supposed to do and the bristles are stiff enough to do a good job.</li>
    <li> It is really easy to make straight lines or &amp;#34;smiles&amp;#34; with this brush. I have ordered few brushes for french manicure in Amazon before, but they are not even close to this one. You will have beautiful french manicure every time you gonna use this brush. And you can use the other side of the brush to make some &amp;#34;polka&amp;#34; dots or flowers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend it !</li>
    <li> Works perfect! Love it! Great for French mani/pedi or to remove nail polish on edges . Also great for art work</li>
    <li> The bristles are stiff and the brush in general is decent quality. I use it to clean up the sides of my nails after I paint them and it does the job.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t even get the right product.  Mine was a make up brush.  no design tip end either.  Sucks</li>
    <li> Its a great product!!! And I recommended to my friends that does nails.</li>
    <li> Its grate makes French very nice</li>
    <li> This brush came fast. Very well made, and sturdy. I love my french manicure even though I am not a professional. I love this brush, I would recommend this to anyone who are doing their own french manicure.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been doing my own gel manicures for a couple of years now. Last fall I bought this brush and it caused a HUGE improvement in my French manicure technique. Fast forward a few months. Now I&#x27;m taking an art class and I&#x27;ve learned that Kolinsky bushes are like the finest you can buy. They&#x27;re made from the tail hairs of a Russian weasel -males only. They&#x27;re VERY expensive! I&#x27;m still very much a beginner artist so I can&#x27;t really say how that matters, but this brush is much higher quality than my other nail brushes. I just got one Kolinsky watercolor brush, and my uneducated eye can&#x27;t see much difference between the hairs on it and the hairs on this nail brush. Can&#x27;t tell you what this information means, but maybe an artist will find the info useful.</li>
