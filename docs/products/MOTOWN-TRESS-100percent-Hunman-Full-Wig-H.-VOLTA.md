    <li> THIS IS THE FIRST SHORT WIG I REALLY LIKE. IT FITS MY HEAD PERFECTLY. THE ONLY THING I WISH IT HAD ARE COMBS TO KEEP FROM MOVING. I LIKE THE FACT IT HUMAN HAIR SO I CAN STYLE IT ANY WAY I WANT TO. IT CAME AT A RESONABLE TIME. I AM VERY HAPPY AND SATISFIED WITH THIS PRODUCT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH!!!</li>
    <li> I viewed several youtube tutorials with ladies modeling this wig, before I purchased it, so I had some idea of how this wig would look on me.  I have been wearing it a few days now and I get compliments on how great it looks.  Given the opportunity, I would definitely purchase this wig again.</li>
    <li> This wig is Amazing! I&#x27;ve received a lot of compliments while wearing it. I decided to curl it right out of the box because I didn&#x27;t want the flat hair look. Great quality human hair wig. I purchased it because of the reviews and they were absolutely correct.</li>
    <li> This way is an awesome wig! Compliments every time I wear it! I wear it daily and was thinking of buying another one.</li>
    <li> It ok, I wore it out the pack but I suggest taking it to your hair dresser</li>
    <li> Great for wig virgins.</li>
    <li> The hair was very shiny and felt like synthetic hair. It would not curl.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this wig!  it&#x27;s got a natural look and great feel.  Lots of compliments when wearing this number!!! will be ordering another one, diiferent color.</li>
    <li> I love this sassy look. Im probably gonna order again this week. Ive had it for a while now..time for a new one</li>
    <li> I like this style wig and always gravate to the same wig type according to my teenager...It is a sophisticated style but in the summer you will want to fling it across a room because your sweating soo much..Definitely a winter do!</li>
    <li> This wig is great! It looks good on me and I received so many compliments on it.  No one knew it was a wig.  It does not look wiggy at all. I was able to change the swoop bang to either side and it still looked good.  It is my new go to wig on bad hair days. The only thing I did not like is that the sides of the wig pinched a little bit, but if you adjust it properly its just fine.</li>
    <li> The item arrived on time. This wig does not look like the displayed picture and it does not fit well. I should have returned it but did not want the hassle.</li>
    <li> I bought this wig for my mom for Christmas and she absolutely loved it! It looks so good on her.  I recommend this wig.</li>
    <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!! Very natural looking I just took it my stylist and let her take a little bulk off the full side and bam!</li>
    <li> The only problem was a piece of the stitching in the back of the wig was loose. I had to sew it back on the track.</li>
    <li> I was clicking around amazon looking for wigs and this popped up as a suggestion.  So, I went over to YouTube and did a search to see how it looked out of the package and on a regular person.  The reviews were pretty good and it looked very natural.  I ordered it in the off black and it came within 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looked good straight out of the packaging.  The cap fit pretty snug.  I have a large sized head.  I&#x27;d definitely reccomend corn-rolling your hair for the best results.  If you have any bulk underneath it will definitely show,  I used a flat iron to bump the banges a little and it was ready to wear.  The quality of the hair is nice.  It&#x27;s about the texture of relaxed black hair.  It looks like a really nice sew0in weave.  The back is tapered well.  If you&#x27;re so inclined you can take a razor comb and taper it down more.  And do some face framing, thinning of the bangs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have any complaints at all about this unit!</li>
    <li> I really like this wig but only gave it 4 stars because it could&#x27;ve been a little longer in the back to make me feel more comfortable with it and not feel like I have to keep pulling it down in the back. But over all I do like it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this wig.  I am natural and I was looking for something cute to wear for a wedding that I am in this summer.  I did not want to get a sew in or have weave glued to my head.  This wig is the best.  I wore it this weekend to test it out and I received so many compliments! I&#x27;ll probably order it in different colors.</li>
    <li> The clips break easily but other than that great wig human hair yes</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing it since I bought it.  My granddaughter whose 12 has even asked if she could wear it to school.</li>
    <li> I gave this wig two stars, for two reasons. One: shipping time was good. Two: general wig construction good. That&#x27;s all the good now to cons...Ugly! Looking at the picture, the wig looks hip, fresh, youthful, and modern. Wig actually on, looks like an absolute granny@!The bang is too heavy. The overall style again something a granny wouldn&#x27;t even wear. Soooo disappointed. Looks wiggy, especially in the back. Not tapered well at all. I would NEVER suggest this wig to anyone. I was so excited to get the darn thing that I took the tags off before putting it on. Can&#x27;t send it back now, so I guess I will try to sell it at a yard sale. Maybe I can sell it to someone old...say 90!</li>
    <li> The hair fit me perfect for a everyday look.</li>
    <li> I orders this wig December 24th and have not worn it. It does not look anything like the picture. I will definitely not order again. Just a waste of time!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just OK. The bang is very heavy and thick.  May take some time to get used to it.  It was</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had better wigs.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t happy with this purchase at first but after taking some time clawing through the wig with my finger and claw comb the wig now look like I got a really cute short hair cut.</li>
