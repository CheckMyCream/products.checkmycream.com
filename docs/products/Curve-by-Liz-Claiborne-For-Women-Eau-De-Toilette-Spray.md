      <li>kinda flowery, thought it was more like cool water, its okey but</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this perfume for many years and love it, but since I can&#x27;t find it at stores anymore, this is the first time I&#x27;ve ordered it online.  </li>

      <li>To my surprise, i found out that this is not an original Curve .</li>
      <li>but I love the scent (floral, but not too sweet) and it is very reasonably priced as I am not one to spend $$$ for perfume.</li>
      <li>I took a chance and bought 2 because of the price and because I love it so much and am not disappointed.  </li>
      <li>sweet.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s always been the same good quality of curve ,so</li>
      <li>not bad for the price</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s one of my favorites being clean and simply fresh.</li>

      <li>I definitely will buy it from here from now on. :)</li>
      <li>My husband absolutely loves the aroma!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a light and airy scent, not heavy or&lt;br /&gt;sickening</li>
      <li>I found this exact size at the mall for $50.</li>
      <li>At first i thought it was just me</li>
      <li>This is my favorite and only perfume I use.  </li>
      <li>but not what I expected, thought it would smell more like coolwater, since its blue, but its more flowery, tolerable</li>
      <li>and you don&#x27;t have to spray much on.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for years and and bought it from many other places and Amazon is the cheapest place I&#x27;ve ever purchased it.</li>
      <li>the smell only lasts a fraction of the original.</li>
      <li>Not as fancy as many other perfumes</li>
      <li>Price is nice, but the scent does not last as long as Curve that was purchased in a B&amp;M store.</li>
      <li>Could not find in any stores, this was a Christmas present ,she was so happy to get it as she loves it, could find other curve but not the blue one.</li>
      <li>I got this perfume because everywhere I went the prices were just too high</li>
      <li>I wear this everyday and have for many years.  </li>
      <li>this has to be very old.</li>
      <li>This is a huge bottle, and will last a long time.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s a fake.</li>
      <li>I have used the original Curve by Liz Claiborne for women for several years.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s difficult to find it now that they changed things around and made new</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> To my surprise, i found out that this is not an original Curve . I have a 3.4 ounce bottle that I&#x27;ve been using for several years now and this one from AMAZON is a diluted version of that. the smell only lasts a fraction of the original. At first i thought it was just me so i asked my parents, both of whom have bought or used Curve. They both agreed there was something wrong with it, especially with the strength of the smell(i had not told them it was fake at this point). As a result we came to unanimous conclusion. This Curve bought directly from Amazon is FAKE.     I&#x27;m very disappointed especially since I&#x27;ve been their customer for over 4 years now.</li>
    <li> This is a smaller bottle than I thought.  But I love the smell of this stuff!</li>
    <li> Good purchase, good price</li>
    <li> I ordered a $25.00 bottle of Liz Claiborne&#x27;s CURVE women&#x27;s perfume and it hardly has any fragrance to it at all.  I&#x27;ve used this perfume for many years and love it, but since I can&#x27;t find it at stores anymore, this is the first time I&#x27;ve ordered it online.  It seems to be watered down and hardly has any fragrance to it.  I&#x27;m very disappointed with it.</li>

    <li> Fast shipping, they kept me updated of the shipping status, the product is exactly as described, excellent for the price,I&#x60;m very satisfied with this purchase. Keep up this excellent service guys!!!!</li>
    <li> I love Curve, always have. Fast &amp; nicely shipped. Always get prays for the nice sent, which makes me feel like a million bucks. Definitely worth trying, NO dissapointments here, go for it.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite and only perfume I use.  I&#x27;ve used this for many years and can&#x27;t do without it. I have received lots of compliments over the years and people ask me what perfume I&#x27;m using all the time.</li>
    <li> I use to wear this perfume back in the 90&#x27;s. I found this exact size at the mall for $50. I decided to check it out on Amazon and found it for way less.&lt;br /&gt;This bottle still smells the same as it did back then.&lt;br /&gt;I can say that I am very pleased with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, always get told I smell good and asked what type of perfume I&#x27;m wearing when I wear this.</li>
    <li> I used Curve and I alway purchase this product because it has a delightful fragance. And serve the purpose in which I purchased it.</li>

    <li> I highly recommend excellent product, I am satisfied with the same quality product.</li>
    <li> It stinks and I have a headache that will not go away, its really strong scent. :(</li>
    <li> Sprayed it on my wrist when the package came.  3 hours later, can&#x27;t smell it at all.  Wish I could return it.&lt;br /&gt;I will just accept that I will never find the original again. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have always enjoyed the scent of curve. It has nice light scent and you don&#x27;t have to spray much on. Liz Claiborne Rocks!!!</li>

    <li> My favorite! Love the size and packaging as well.</li>
    <li> I have made several attempts to contact the company I bought it from but they don&#x27;t answer their email.  I have been buying this product for years &amp; I have never had the perfume go bad. this has to be very old.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume!  I&#x27;ve used it for years and always get complimented on how good it smells.  No need for a daytime and a night-time fragrance...this one is both.</li>
    <li> Me encanta un delicioso aroma.</li>

    <li> My husband absolutely loves the aroma!</li>
    <li> Just as described and a Quality Product AAA+++ at a Great Price :)</li>
    <li> Price is nice, but the scent does not last as long as Curve that was purchased in a B&amp;M store. It also smells slightly different, but still nice. This is a huge bottle, and will last a long time.</li>
    <li> Love it! Great value (ounces for dollars) will be ordering again when I run out. Great shipper!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s a fake. The fragrance only lasts for a little while. Won&#x27;t be ordering it again. But I guess that&#x27;s what you get for $20 bucks!</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted,,The fragrance is crisp and alluring,  The price is amazingly is affordable for an upscale perfume such as Liz Clairborne fragrances.  Shipping was very fast! I just love the citrus and earthy accents.  Curve is a must have fragrance!  It lasts all day and into the evening as well...</li>
    <li> I miss this fragrance.  It&#x27;s one of my favorites being clean and simply fresh. I took a chance and bought 2 because of the price and because I love it so much and am not disappointed.  The color looks deeper blue, but smells the same. I liked it so much, I just reordered 2 more for storing.</li>

    <li> Excellent product and delivery on time</li>
    <li> kinda flowery, thought it was more like cool water, its okey but not what I thought&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its okay but not what I expected, thought it would smell more like coolwater, since its blue, but its more flowery, tolerable</li>
    <li> not bad for the price although very fresh, I thought it was a more watery sent than a flower sent</li>
