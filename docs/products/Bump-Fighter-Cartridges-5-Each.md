      <li>These blades have GREATLY reduced my issues and i go weeks without a single bump.  </li>
      <li>(cool shave gel &amp; after shave razor bump</li>
      <li>After my initial shave with the razors i thought it was good</li>
      <li>The best thing&#x27;s that come along for the shaving black man since the razor was invented!!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pleased to receive more for the same cost!!</li>
      <li>I would most definitely pay more of</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not the closest shave, but you won&#x27;t tear your face up in the process, which is worth it in my opinion.</li>
      <li>This my friends is the BEST razor around for African American men with sensitive skin or ingrown hair</li>
      <li>Very, very forgiving.</li>
      <li>Thank you very much</li>
      <li>Finish it off with a little bump patrol and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
      <li>It still leaves a pretty close shave.</li>
      <li>but subsequent shaves made me realise i was better off with my depilatories.</li>
      <li>Product is exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>I absolutely swear buy them!  </li>
      <li>First time using this product.  </li>
      <li>Exactly what I needed to control hair bumps</li>
      <li>I am a 42 year old white male and have been dealing with ingrown hairs for many, many years now before realizing you can do something about it!  </li>
      <li>I rate Bump Fighter very high on the list of shaving products.</li>
      <li>Only blade that give me a smooth shave without bumping.</li>
      <li>My face didn&#x27;t seem to flare up as much.</li>
      <li>Thanks for the fast shipping, could not find these razors at any store, was a Father&#x27;s Day gift for my husband</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t make a very close shave, so it doesn&#x27;t scrape or irritate the skin, nor pull.</li>
      <li>After the Bump shave, you can go over the face with a single-blade throw-away for a really close shave.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>These blades really do the trick.  </li>
      <li>Very close shave, no nicks,razor-burn or bumps.</li>
      <li>Reasonable price, for a quality product.</li>
      <li>I have use these every other day  for many years now and have never gotten saving bumps.</li>
      <li>Fine for the office but not as professional as I&#x27;d like when speaking/presenting in public.  </li>
      <li>Recommendation: get a high quality razor and protective foam, or a high quality electric.</li>
      <li>oh how surprised he was, because he also had been looking for them, he was using one that was wore out and old, thanks again, I would recommend</li>
      <li>I highly recommend them for Guys with sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I think it would work if you just had sensitive skin, but the razor itself is pretty low quality-</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found that more passes helps for those looking to get a closer shave just especially after you rinse your head off, clean it up while it&#x27;s still wet and get those few strays.</li>
      <li>It certainly does not shave nearly as close as the triple and quad-blade razors, but that&#x27;s a big part of the reason why it prevents bumps (I suspect).  </li>
      <li>I would recommend this product to any man with problems with hair bumps, and sensitive skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Gives me the best shave!</li>
    <li> I useto have acne for years and hated shaving my face because every time i did it would break out. Then i bought bump fighter and since these blades do not cut below the epidermis they do not irritate like most razors do. In all they cut clean and wont break your face out if you have acne.</li>
    <li> I have a thick beard and sensitive neck so I tired this.  I think it would work if you just had sensitive skin, but the razor itself is pretty low quality- it tugs a lot and is somewhat painful for me to use even with a fresh razor.  The shave is not very close which I would be willing to overlook but for the other issue.  It also nicks a fair amount if you try to get a close shave with it.    I will keep this for my chest because it wasn&#x27;t that expensive but wont replace it.      Recommendation: get a high quality razor and protective foam, or a high quality electric.</li>
    <li> I purchased these razors after searching in stores for weeks.  I absolutely swear buy them!  My boyfriend has the most gorgeous skin!  He shaves every morning and has no irritation, razor bumps or ingrown hairs.  His skin is soft and touchable.  I love these razors!!!</li>
    <li> I develop bumps on my skin when I shave below the surface, so traditional razors do not do the trick for me. I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and have always had a good experience.</li>
    <li> Maybe these &amp;#34;blades&amp;#34; are sufficiently dull to be used for head shaving, but they&#x27;re woefully lacking for face shaving.  I&#x27;ll have to look for another Trac-2 alternative.</li>
    <li> Excellent product highly recommend to others.</li>
    <li> If you suffer from razor bumps and skin irritation - this product is a must have. I don&#x27;t shave home without it!</li>
    <li> This my friends is the BEST razor around for African American men with sensitive skin or ingrown hair problems.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this product that was easily found at Walgreen&#x27;s or Walmart, (But no longer available in stores)For a number of years. The blade never touches your skin and leaves a smooth and nick free surface. No other razor comes close to this product for the desired affect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use it in tandem with \\&quot;Bump Patrol\\&quot; (cool shave gel &amp; after shave razor bump treatment)And you won&#x27;t believe the great result!!! Even if you prefer a different razor, The Gel &amp; Aftershave works wonders in clearing up bumps like nothing else. It&#x27;s a shame that my only means of purchase is on the internet and not at my local convenient store. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this (these)Products, Give it a try.</li>
    <li> I used to purchase these at Walmart; however, recently Walmart suddenly stopped selling them.  Price is better at Amazon, so I&#x27;m happy.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of razors, but these are the only ones I use.  What I especially like about them is that you don&#x27;t have to worry about nicking yourself even if you&#x27;re rushing and shaving with reckless abandon!  It&#x27;s not the closest shave, but you won&#x27;t tear your face up in the process, which is worth it in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a white guy that gets embarrassing razor bumps and ingrown hairs that are very similar to what many African American men deal with. These blades have GREATLY reduced my issues and i go weeks without a single bump.  Ignore the fancy 5 blade vibrating razors (marketing only) and give these a shot.  You will not be sorry!  Just give your neck some time to heal from your old razor, and you&#x27;ll soon see a big difference.</li>
    <li> Razors work extremely well, not a SUPER close shave but close enough.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong for those that have the blackman&#x27;s condition. I have been using these for over 10 years now.</li>
    <li> This product works great.  Been using it for almost 4 years now and I have nothing but rave reviews for it.  try it.</li>
    <li> Used these blades for 12 years great for bald heads. Safe on your skin with no nicks or abrasions, great blades for keeping you smooth. This blade will help to minimize bumps even in trouble areas.</li>
    <li> This product is one of the best I have found to fight Razor bumps. I am a black male and have been fighting Razor bumps for over 20 years now. After trying Bump Fighter, I noticed a big difference. My face didn&#x27;t seem to flare up as much. I noticed my skin to be smoother and not as many bumps. I rate Bump Fighter very high on the list of shaving products.</li>
    <li> The razor is made with little barriers so the blade doesn&#x27;t touch the skin. I like how it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like the other ones where the blade touches the skin. It still leaves a pretty close shave. I like how it has holes in the plastic part, because I can run the blade under the water and it clears out the stubble and soap (I shave in the shower using bar soap as my shaving lotion).</li>
    <li> This item meets my expectations</li>
    <li> The bumpfighter blades are essential for getting a close shave without creating the sharp pointed hairs that curl around and grow back into the skin.  I use them regularly and I don&#x27;t have painful shaving events anymore.</li>
    <li> Very close shave, no nicks,razor-burn or bumps. Reasonable price, for a quality product. TRY IT!!</li>
    <li> Great for sensitive skin and definitely an awesome shaver</li>
    <li> I always order these online because I can&#x27;t find them in stores anymore.  When I did find them, I had to buy the razor handle to get the 2 blades.  The price is great for 15 refill blades.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years and never had a razor bump (unlike other razors.)  A must for me.</li>
    <li> I cannot find this at any Wal-mart or K-mart.The blades do their job without tearing up my face.If you are a Black man who needs razor blades designed for our facial hair, this is the item for you.</li>
    <li> IF you have issues with ingrown hairs this product will help. I have used it for 15 years now. Short of doing hair removal this is best product for me.    I can not find it locally anymore os i have to buy it online.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the order.</li>
    <li> My husband loves these razors.  He can shave with far less irritation.</li>
    <li> These blades are the best if you want  a close shave without  bumps. have used them for YEARS!!!</li>
    <li> Prompt and exactly as expected.</li>
    <li> I STOP SHAVING FOR A FEW BUT WHEN I GO BACK I HAVE BLADES THEY WORK WONDERFUL. TRY IT YOU WILL LIKE IT</li>
    <li> Has helped a great deal with ingrown hairs.  First time using this product.  Very pleased with it.  Nice smooth shave.</li>
    <li> Product performs as designed but doesn&#x27;t provide as close a shave as the disposables.</li>
    <li> If you suffer from pseudophlicalitis-razor bumps; this is the best of breed. I have been using for 15 years.</li>
    <li> Only blade that give me a smooth shave without bumping. The blades are hard to find in other locations and stores.</li>
    <li> It works for me.  The only one I use.</li>
    <li> Thanks for the fast shipping, could not find these razors at any store, was a Father&#x27;s Day gift for my husband and oh how surprised he was, because he also had been looking for them, he was using one that was wore out and old, thanks again, I would recommend</li>
    <li> My dermatologist turned me on to this and it definitely works.  Haven&#x27;t had one now in two months since switching.  Also using Aveeno shaving gel.  I am a 42 year old white male and have been dealing with ingrown hairs for many, many years now before realizing you can do something about it!  It certainly does not shave nearly as close as the triple and quad-blade razors, but that&#x27;s a big part of the reason why it prevents bumps (I suspect).  by the end of the day I have a midnight shadow (vs. a 5 O&#x27;clock).  Fine for the office but not as professional as I&#x27;d like when speaking/presenting in public.  Hard to find refills.  This order took a while to be received (via regular no rush shipping which is what I paid for).  Not a problem unless you&#x27;re down to your last refill.  The pack arrived with (3) 6-blade refills (total of 18 blades) not the (15) that is advertised.  I&#x27;m pleased to receive more for the same cost!!</li>
    <li> The best thing&#x27;s that come along for the shaving black man since the razor was invented!!!</li>
    <li> Good Product for those with sensitive skin &amp; prone to ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> After reading several reviews i decided to buy this product.I thought i had finally found a solution to my razor bumps,but that was not the case.After my initial shave with the razors i thought it was good but subsequent shaves made me realise i was better off with my depilatories.</li>
    <li> These I love I would most definitely pay more of</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed to control hair bumps</li>
    <li> No way can you cut yourself while shaving with these serrated blades.  I can move the shaving handle with blade in &#x27;every which way&#x27; direction, and not risk getting &#x27;nicked.&#x27;  [cut].  Very, very forgiving.</li>
    <li> This is a bargain price for these razor blades , it&#x27;s hard to find them in stores. I love the smoothness of njy husbands face after shaving, I&#x27;m so glad they&#x27;re acailable through amazon.</li>
    <li> When carefully cleaned by rinsing, these cartridges offer a long use. They don&#x27;t make a very close shave, so it doesn&#x27;t scrape or irritate the skin, nor pull. After the Bump shave, you can go over the face with a single-blade throw-away for a really close shave. Track-2 blades fit the handle, but can irritate the skin.</li>
    <li> These blades really do the trick.  Will continue buying them in the future.  Great product !  Thank you very much</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Bump Fighter for years.  It provides a great shave and minimizes razor bumps.  Very happy with this product--couldn&#x27;t imagine anything better</li>
    <li> This item is difficult to find.  Very glad I thought of Amazon.  Product is exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I have always used this but it&#x27;s not on the shelves anymore so that&#x27;s why I get them here now</li>
    <li> I never use anything but Bump Fighter Blades. I&#x27;ve been using them since 1982 and I have never had any problems with bumps after I shave! I highly recommend them for Guys with sensitive skin. Best blades money can buy for a Black Man&#x27;s face!</li>
    <li> Just what the hubby was looking to use.</li>
    <li> Not a good razor at all. It leaves ton of rough. Its cheap and shows it.</li>
    <li> For a long time, my son has been searching for a razor that would help control the red bumps that he gets from shaving, and to no avail until BUMP FIGHTER! This is a FABULOUS product and you can&#x27;t beat the price that you get on Amazon. Thank you!</li>
    <li> it is really hard for me to find the refill paks where i live. I got a great deal and didn&#x27;t have to search all over town for them:)</li>
    <li> Great product for the money !.... I always use this product and I love shopping on amazon for the great prices.</li>
    <li> I thought these items were being discontinued because the places around here that have been selling these razors have stopped carrying them. I&#x27;m glad I was able to find them again.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to any man with problems with hair bumps, and sensitive skin. This is a very excellent product.</li>
    <li> This product is slowly being removed from store shelves. Amazon still has them through various vendors. Some shave better than others so I am not sure why. Packaging is the same as store bought. Price is better when purchased in bulk</li>
    <li> Produces a nice smooth shave!  Highly recommend bump fighter razor to any black man who is seeking&lt;br /&gt;a nice smooth shave.</li>
    <li> The razors work great! A good close shave without accidental cuts.</li>
    <li> These razors are perfect for those looking to get a nice shave without the afterburn or irritation. I recently started using these to shave my face and head and have no complaints so far. Prior to that I was using an Andis Outliner II (which I still use to shape my beard and cut my hair back down prior to shaving it again when it grows out or for the occasional dry shave on my face). Usually get a few solid uses from each cartridge before I have to swap out, which isn&#x27;t too bad. I usually swap out my razor cartridge every two shaves if I&#x27;m doing both my face and head, more uses if I&#x27;m just doing my face. Now if you&#x27;re looking for an extremely close shave, you may want to look elsewhere. See, these razors are designed to cut close but not close enough to where your curly hair starts to grow inside your skin. I&#x27;ve found that more passes helps for those looking to get a closer shave just especially after you rinse your head off, clean it up while it&#x27;s still wet and get those few strays. Finish it off with a little bump patrol and you&#x27;re good to go. Baldies of the world unite! : ) PEACE</li>
    <li> I have been using these blades for many years now. And aim very satisfied with their results.I will contour to purchase them in the future.</li>
    <li> Works great. Finally and item that does what it says. shaved with this product and have not seen any bumps, even around the neck line.</li>
    <li> Very good shave.  Thanks</li>
    <li> I have use these every other day  for many years now and have never gotten saving bumps. Smooth shave too!</li>
    <li> Received the blades, but &#x27;2&#x27; of the blades did not have razors in them!!&lt;br /&gt;WOW!</li>
    <li> these started out to work well for me</li>
    <li> I was not initially introduced to the product by Amazon, but rather through another retail seller. After noticing the seller no longer stocked my favorite brand razor, turned to Amazon for the solution. I was very  happy to find it here! As a man of color, this product was a great value to me and a must-have as a regular shaver.</li>
    <li> I chose Bump Fighter products because my beard is thick, my skin is sensitive, and I get razor bumps when I use other products.  With Bump Fighter, I get a clean, close shave everytime--no stubble--and I get up to three or four shave out of every cartridge.</li>
    <li> I am Caucasian, but this the only shaver that works for me. I cannot use an electric</li>
    <li> For more than just your face, too.</li>
    <li> It works well for those with razor bumps, however it&#x27;s not a close shave.  You want neccessarily look completely clean shaven with this unless you just have a thin beard.</li>
