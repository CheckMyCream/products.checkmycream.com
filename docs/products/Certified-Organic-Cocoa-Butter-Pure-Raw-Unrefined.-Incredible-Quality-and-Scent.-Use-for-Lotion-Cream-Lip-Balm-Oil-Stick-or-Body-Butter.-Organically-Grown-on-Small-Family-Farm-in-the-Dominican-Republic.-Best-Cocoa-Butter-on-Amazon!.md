      <li>The cocoa butter smells so delicious and came  in the form of a block like white chocolate.</li>
      <li>Came quickly and made a nice body butter from it.</li>
      <li>They smelled earthy and were easy to manipulate into the products.  </li>
      <li>The shea butter came in a Tupperware-like container that was relatively easy.</li>

      <li>My lotion smells really good and makes my skin really soft.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!!!!</li>
      <li>Personally I prefer a product packaged on a smaller scale to a product that is perfectly packaged by a machine, especially if I can get a product this good!</li>

      <li>it melts smoothly and absorbs quickly.</li>

      <li>Arrived quickly, and work very well in my recipes.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe that we have tried so many different products and nothing worked for him.  </li>
      <li>They worked very well!</li>

      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>For an easy body butter melt (double boiler):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My dark spots are fading nicely as a result.&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend this company and this product.</li>
      <li>Very well made chopsticks and lotions</li>
      <li>; My cocoa butter came in a ziplock bag as a wide &amp;#34;Bar&amp;#34; that was easily cut with my kitchen knives.</li>
      <li>These whipped up into a very fluffy and lovely consistency.</li>
      <li>Which has worked so far in my pregnancy...</li>
      <li>Both items looked and smelled old.</li>

<li> They definitely went back and not worth the money!</li>
<li> I bought it to make lotion bars and other natural body products, but as soon as my boyfriend saw and felt the Shea butter I had to pull out half the pound for him to use undiluted on his skin.</li>
<li> and they are really dry.</li>
<li> No longer dry on my hands and feet.</li>
<li> In one weeks time his feet are so soft and there are no more dry patches.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love it.  It is just what I ordered.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! I use it to make moisturizer with essential oils.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and as promised!</li>
    <li> I love the cocoa &amp; Shea butter! It&#x27;s amazing! I use it to make lotion, beard balm, body scrub - all kinds of stuff.  I will definitely order again when I need more!</li>
    <li> Really excellent, pure products.  Arrived quickly, and work very well in my recipes.</li>
    <li> Deeply disappointed. Reasons I purchased this&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Certified Organic&lt;br /&gt;2. Pure Raw&lt;br /&gt;3. The &amp;#34;freshest&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I didn&#x27;t realize the rest of the review had been cut off. When I purchased this it was advertised as organic and what I received had the consistency of wet sand and had started to smell rancid. Looks like the company has upgraded it&#x27;s packaging and hopefully that&#x27;s not a problem for them any more.</li>
    <li> I used both of these products to make my own body and hair products.  They worked very well! They smelled earthy and were easy to manipulate into the products.  I would definitely purchase from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Great quality at a great price. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Will work perfectly for the body butter recipe I have for Christmas gifts.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Very well made chopsticks and lotions</li>
    <li> Arrived damaged and unusable. The product was not safely packed... I guess I got what I paid for.</li>
    <li> It is not what is pictured. It was sent in plastic to go containers and were cracked with holes in them. Both items looked and smelled old. They definitely went back and not worth the money!</li>
    <li> Love this product , bought it to make body butter and the quality amazing!!!! The coco butter scent smells like chocolate. My daughter says she just wants to eat it lol. The Shea butter is so fresh you can use it right out of the container so moisturizing the consistency when making the body butter was perfect. The packaging is great with re sealable bags to keep it fresh I will buy this product again. Thank you Sandra</li>
    <li> Awesome and will definitely order again!</li>
    <li> The cocoa butter smells so delicious and came  in the form of a block like white chocolate. In fact, that how white chocolate is made, from cocoa butter.The shea butter does not have any smell and was pack inside a plastic container. I also read that Shea butter ranks from grade &amp;#34;A&amp;#34; to &amp;#34;F&amp;#34;, with A being the highest quality. This Shea is grade &amp;#34;A&amp;#34; but the information is not on the title like the competitive product and I almost missed it. The price is good too. The shea butter is lumpy but I did some research that it has to do with the type of butter, not the quality. This is my second order after a week. I melted the cocoa butter in a double boiler. Then added coconut oil and mint oil to make my lip balm. I mixed the shea butter with cocoa butter and coconut oil. Then added a few drops of Argan oil and lavender oil to make lotion. My lotion smells really good and makes my skin really soft. I am thinking about adding carrott seed oil for SPF and to remove wrinkles. I heard that Argan oil and carrott seed oils are very good for hair and skin.</li>
    <li> Good quality products.  They arrived quickly and in good condition. They are great for body butter and soap making.</li>
    <li> Very nice and creamy has a lovely texture to it, lovely smell.</li>
    <li> Great quality!!!! Made body butter for several serious scars from a burn on my face and arms.  My dark spots are fading nicely as a result.&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend this company and this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these to make DIY lotion bars and lip balm. Excellent quality. Will definitely use again.</li>
    <li> Product is not packaged like we are used to seeing in a store, but the quality of the cocoa and Shea butter is outstanding! The cocoa butter smells delicious and although the Shea butter doesn&#x27;t smell as wonderful (not offensive, just not delicious) it melts smoothly and absorbs quickly. I bought it to make lotion bars and other natural body products, but as soon as my boyfriend saw and felt the Shea butter I had to pull out half the pound for him to use undiluted on his skin. It&#x27;s great for moisturizing tattoos and dry skin and he prefers it&#x27;s relatively neutral scent. However, when the Shea butter is combined with the cocoa butter and beeswax in a lotion bar everyone loves the scent and extra moisturizing product.  Personally I prefer a product packaged on a smaller scale to a product that is perfectly packaged by a machine, especially if I can get a product this good!</li>
    <li> I purchased these both on more than one occasion and have not been disappointed it the quality and quick delivery time.  Thank you.  My clients love the combination I use with these two butters and more for the animals and themselves.</li>
    <li> Great smell and good shipping</li>
    <li> This is by far the best FOOD GRADE cocoa butter and shea butter price out there. Please note that food grade is significantly better quality than just &amp;#34;organic.&amp;#34; My cocoa butter came in a ziplock bag as a wide &amp;#34;Bar&amp;#34; that was easily cut with my kitchen knives. The shea butter came in a Tupperware-like container that was relatively easy. For an easy body butter melt (double boiler):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 cup shea butter (about half of a 1lb order)&lt;br /&gt;1 cup cocoa butter (about half of a 1lb order)&lt;br /&gt;1 cup of SWEET almond oil&lt;br /&gt;1 cup of coconut oil&lt;br /&gt;2-3 drops of peppermint oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells like christmas (dark chocolate and peppermint) and works amazing!!!</li>
    <li> Deliciously silky, beautiful butters....arrived quickly and packaged well....and when I made my homemade body butter, I fell in love!!!! My skin has never been softer!!! Highly recommended!!!!</li>
    <li> Good quality cocoa &amp; shea butter!</li>
    <li> Great quality and price! I will be ordering again!</li>
    <li> I bought both of these for making my own lotions and face moisturizer with essential oils. These whipped up into a very fluffy and lovely consistency. I love the way my skin feels when I use my homemade lotions. This will last you a very long time too. I love it so much I am going to start making stuff for friends and family too!</li>
    <li> Eight-star product over the excellent product</li>
    <li> Great quality. Excellent packaging. Will order my cocoa butter and shea butter from this seller again.</li>
    <li> great product,great price</li>
    <li> I bought the Cocoa butter and Ivory shea butter about three weeks ago.  The quality of the Cocoa and she butter are top of the line. I made my own body butter with it and my skin feels like silk. No longer dry on my hands and feet. I have also used it on my husbands feet and they are really dry. In one weeks time his feet are so soft and there are no more dry patches. I can&#x27;t believe that we have tried so many different products and nothing worked for him.  I love the shea and the cocoa scent.  The price is great and you must try their products you would be disappointed.</li>
    <li> When I opened the bag to remove the butters, I was shocked to see that one of the butters were placed in a quart size &amp;#34;ziplock&amp;#34; bag.  I mean a ziplock bag that you would buy for personal home use.  Not a ziplock for commercial use.  It seemed strange to me that it was packaged that way but the product looks and smells fine.  It was purchased for homemade soaps, lotions, etc.</li>
    <li> Love this!  Came quickly and made a nice body butter from it.</li>
    <li> I combined these two, added coconut oil and made my own ani stretch mark salve. Which has worked so far in my pregnancy... Knock on wood. Product came as advertised, good quality.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s wonderful to have the ingredients to make your lotion or body butter.  It&#x27;s also great to simply apply the oil directly to your skin.  I&#x27;ve purchased this more than once, and definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Both products were great.  I made homemade lotion with these products, almond oil, coconut oil, vitamin E, chamomile oil, beeswax and borage oil.  It is excellent for controlling psoriasis and eczema.  Also terrific as an everyday lotion.  These products were perfect for making the lotion and were packaged nicely to hold the leftover product until next time!</li>
