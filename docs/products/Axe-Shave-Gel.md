### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>/&gt;Normally foams are convenient, however you do not get the best quality.</li>
      <li>I used it with my Mach 3 razor and was really impressed with the results.</li>
      <li>This probably the best shaving cream I have used!</li>
      <li>All in all, I&#x27;m extremely happy with this product.</li>
      <li>Chilled is a great way to describe this gel, and a great feeling to have on your skin.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a cooling shave gel, you might want to look elsewhere as this product did not do a great job as a cooling gel.</li>
      <li>All in all, this is a good product in comparison with the competition.</li>
      <li>Its not sticky, lubricates well for your razor, and is a good product.\\&quot;</li>
      <li>Also leaves skin feeling good, without drying.</li>
      <li>But my legs were smooth afterwards and I felt good about it.</li>
      <li>I would have liked the gel to generated more foam.  </li>
      <li>Thankfully, Axe has given us a pretty great one.  </li>
      <li>Gives a great, smooth, clean shave.  </li>
      <li>This one is pretty good in getting a close shave and it has a good clean aroma.  </li>
      <li>That said, this still does a competent job and leaves your face feeling refreshed and not overly-scented.</li>
      <li>It just smells manly, like girls would love it.  </li>
      <li>However, I did love the scent on my face after using this product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice, smooth shave.</li>
      <li>and so I&#x27;m always searching for a &#x60;better shave&#x27; (as I think most men are).  </li>
      <li>I have had better</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just ok.</li>
      <li>Maybe i just watched too many of their commercials.</li>
      <li>I liked the cool feeling and scent of this shaving gel.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy with that combination of products but always am trying new products.  </li>
      <li>I figured if it is good enough for men on their face it ought to be good for my legs too.  </li>
      <li>This line of body products are all quite good and reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>Cleans up easily.</li>
      <li>Razor moved easily on my legs</li>
      <li>Axe products are just overpowering and way too strong.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t leave razor burn, feels good on the skin, and has a nice, fresh masculine scent.  </li>
      <li>This is very likely a great product for men who might need to shave their heads as well as their face.</li>
      <li>: The gel is so watery that it cannot produce a rich foam</li>
      <li>However that requires a real gel to work, but this Axe \\&quot;so called\\&quot; gel converts into a foam on contact, before even I&#x27;m able to use my brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found that I&#x27;ve had to use significantly more shaving gel in order to get a clean shave than I normally would.</li>
      <li>That makes this favorite shaving gel so far.</li>
      <li>Nothing exceptional and, to be certain, over five shaves I used, alernately my Merkur Double Edge and a Gillette Cartridge style.</li>
      <li>It stays on the skin instead of slipping of and had a very refreshing feel and scent.</li>
      <li>shave gel provides a nice, smooth shaving experience and leaves your skin hydrated and not feeling dried out.</li>
      <li>and I was able to do job quickly without any obstacles.  </li>
      <li>He said he didn&#x27;t notice it being any more \\&quot;chilling\\&quot; than similar shaving gels.</li>
      <li>\\&quot;Axe products are consistent, and this is no exception.</li>
      <li>Both worked well enough but there was no noticeable difference and use of the product did not produce a better shave.</li>
      <li>For other people, this might be a different issue, but it wasn&#x27;t great for</li>
      <li>It is a refreshing formula that sinks into the pores of your skin and delivers a soft and smooth shave.  </li>
      <li>Compared to Edge, it leaves a sticky residue on my face that I have to wash off with soap and gets very foamy out of the can rather than on the face.</li>
      <li>This shave gel works really well.</li>
      <li>Lather is good, but not so thick that you can&#x27;t see where you&#x27;re shaving like with many other shave gels &amp; creams.</li>
      <li>Comes back to life with a fresh splash of water on the face when needed.</li>
      <li>so doesn&#x27;t go very far.</li>
      <li>It really does not, as the \\&quot;chill\\&quot; is barely noticable.  </li>
      <li>The other ones i have used created big foams, but this guy is more of gel than foam.  </li>
      <li>could image that Axe designed this to help, but after seeing real foam in action, I could not go back to lower quality.</li>
      <li>K Gillette Fusion Hydra Gel Shave Gel, Ultra Sensitive, 7-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 6)]]</li>
      <li>For the last year or so I, switched to using a ([[ASIN:B000G647Y8 real shaving brush]] + gel combination, which brings together the close shave of traditional methods, with the convenience of the modern.</li>
      <li>so I must admit I felt quite masculine after I used this product.  </li>
      <li>My normal standard is using Remington Alpha Gel with a Glide razor.  </li>
      <li>Simply rub it in your hands then apply it as you normally would.</li>
      <li>This is one of the few shave gels that has not given me razor burn or any irritation (I have pretty sensitive skin, which can be a burden when it comes to shaving).  </li>
      <li>My husband complains that most shaving gels are hard to use since it slips out of your wet fingers.</li>
      <li>It only takes a little but works really well.</li>

    <li> Too expensive for what it does. No better than $2 gel shaving creme from Walmart.  I just got it to match the small of their other products I was using.  It&#x27;s only 7 oz. so doesn&#x27;t go very far.</li>
    <li> Pro: Unlike [[ASIN:B001E5E24K Gillette Fusion Hydra Gel Shave Gel, Ultra Sensitive, 7-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 6)]], the Axe is bottled in aluminum and therefore will not rust and leave a ring of brown mark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: The gel is so watery that it cannot produce a rich foam like [[ASIN:B002UUT44Q Nivea for Men Q10 Energy Shaving Gel, 7-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: I am going back to Nivea.</li>
    <li> it was shaving cream. I have had better and I have had worse.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not like Farrah Fawcett was in my bathroom and slathered it on my face. If that was the case, I&#x27;d give it 10 stars.&lt;br /&gt;For those of not old enough to remember the commercial with Farrah and Broadway Joe, go google it.</li>
    <li> This line of body products are all quite good and reasonably priced. You could purchase 100% generic products for less money, but you&#x27;ve likely already decided not to if you&#x27;ve considered any of these options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shave gel provides a nice, smooth shaving experience and leaves your skin hydrated and not feeling dried out. This is very likely a great product for men who might need to shave their heads as well as their face.</li>
    <li> This probably the best shaving cream I have used!</li>
    <li> In the sense that any off the shelf shaving product works, this one does. Nothing exceptional and, to be certain, over five shaves I used, alernately my Merkur Double Edge and a Gillette Cartridge style. Both worked well enough but there was no noticeable difference and use of the product did not produce a better shave. What was different was the smell. It reminded me of a bag of almonds or walnuts kept too long and then opened. A heavy, unpleasant muskiness that on three occasions, in an enclosed shower, led me toward nausea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Axe is a brand high on the list of those products the young who love it and will buy it regardless of quality. What I say, at least to them, isn&#x27;t relevant but to others, remember you&#x27;re not getting anything you couldn&#x27;t get, and for less, at the grocery store or a big box pharmacy. Also, smell isn&#x27;t an integral part of a shave, slipperiness and protection for the skin are. This offers little of either.</li>
    <li> My husband is a big fan of the Axe products, so I picked this out for him to try. He said he didn&#x27;t notice it being any more \\&quot;chilling\\&quot; than similar shaving gels. Bottomline is, it works...but so do the other shaving gels that my husband has used...and price usually dictates which brand he will be using, since he can&#x27;t really tell them apart, other than the individual scents. That being said, this scent wasn&#x27;t as strong/overpowering as some of the other Axe products.</li>
    <li> I hate shaving.  If I could get away with never shaving again, I would.  Sadly, I work in an industry that frowns on heavy facial hair and so I&#x27;m often forced to shave it all off.  Sad but true, different shave gels spurn different results and experiences and so I&#x27;m always searching for a &#x60;better shave&#x27; (as I think most men are).  Thankfully, Axe has given us a pretty great one.  Chilled is a great way to describe this gel, and a great feeling to have on your skin.  It is a refreshing formula that sinks into the pores of your skin and delivers a soft and smooth shave.  It also moisturizes your skin, which is a bonus.  This is one of the few shave gels that has not given me razor burn or any irritation (I have pretty sensitive skin, which can be a burden when it comes to shaving).  All in all, I&#x27;m extremely happy with this product.</li>
    <li> When I received this Axe Shave Gel, I was expecting an upgrade from what I was currently using. But it was disappointing to see it become more of a foam than a gel, which I prefer for shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally foams are convenient, however you do not get the best quality. For the last year or so I, switched to using a ([[ASIN:B000G647Y8 real shaving brush]] + gel combination, which brings together the close shave of traditional methods, with the convenience of the modern. However that requires a real gel to work, but this Axe \\&quot;so called\\&quot; gel converts into a foam on contact, before even I&#x27;m able to use my brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could image that Axe designed this to help, but after seeing real foam in action, I could not go back to lower quality.</li>
    <li> My normal standard is using Remington Alpha Gel with a Glide razor.  I&#x27;m happy with that combination of products but always am trying new products.  Unlike the alpha gel, which stays jelly, the axe foams like an Edge gel.  It works well, but isn&#x27;t&#x27; something to write home about - I didn&#x27;t damage my face, but I didn&#x27;t feel as protected as I am with the alpha gel.  I think the strongest play that this product has, is its matching Chilled after shave gel.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t care for this one at all. Compared to Edge, it leaves a sticky residue on my face that I have to wash off with soap and gets very foamy out of the can rather than on the face.</li>
    <li> I am a fan of shave gels and was hoping this would have some of the same cooling features of the menthol shaving foams of years past.  It really does not, as the \\&quot;chill\\&quot; is barely noticable.  That said, this still does a competent job and leaves your face feeling refreshed and not overly-scented. It compares favorably to Edge gel. I would give Edge the advantage on lubrication but give Axe the advantage on scent.</li>
    <li> It only takes a little but works really well. Simply rub it in your hands then apply it as you normally would. Lather is good, but not so thick that you can&#x27;t see where you&#x27;re shaving like with many other shave gels &amp; creams. Also leaves skin feeling good, without drying. Cleans up easily. Comes back to life with a fresh splash of water on the face when needed. Gives a great, smooth, clean shave.  Didn&#x27;t leave razor burn, feels good on the skin, and has a nice, fresh masculine scent.  Not the old-timey barbershop scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a lot of success with Axe&#x27;s products lately, but I&#x27;m sad to say that this shave gel was not up to par with many of their other products. It&#x27;s not so much that there&#x27;s anything wrong with this shave gel, but there isn&#x27;t much right either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave gel&#x27;s biggest problem is that it&#x27;s not foamy enough. I&#x27;ve found that I&#x27;ve had to use significantly more shaving gel in order to get a clean shave than I normally would. For other people, this might be a different issue, but it wasn&#x27;t great for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t mind the fact that this shave gel isn&#x27;t too foamy, you might want to give this one a try. If you&#x27;re looking for a cooling shave gel, you might want to look elsewhere as this product did not do a great job as a cooling gel. It&#x27;s just ok.</li>
    <li> Review from my husband, John: \\&quot;Axe products are consistent, and this is no exception. It&#x27;s a nice, smooth shave. It&#x27;s a scent that you will either love or hate! Its not sticky, lubricates well for your razor, and is a good product.\\&quot; My notes - He would have put 4 star, but I had to remove one. Axe products are just overpowering and way too strong. TO me, they always give that sense of &#x27;trying too hard&#x27;.</li>
    <li> I have just recently resumed shaving after sporting a fall and winter beard.  This one is pretty good in getting a close shave and it has a good clean aroma.  All in all, this is a good product in comparison with the competition.</li>
    <li> This shave gel works really well. When I used it my face seemed to get a lot less nicks and cuts, and my shave was even closer than normal. I used it with my Mach 3 razor and was really impressed with the results.</li>
    <li> Axe brand is geared towards men.  However, I dared to use this product even though I am a woman.  I have decided to use this cooling, foaming gel to shave my legs.  I figured if it is good enough for men on their face it ought to be good for my legs too.  Razor moved easily on my legs and I was able to do job quickly without any obstacles.  Product has distictly manly fragrance so I must admit I felt quite masculine after I used this product.  I followed the process by applying Axe after shave moisurizing gel on my legs...  I know - I have no shame.... But my legs were smooth afterwards and I felt good about it.</li>
    <li> I used it twice now.  I put the foam into hands and rubbed it over my face.  I would have liked the gel to generated more foam.  The other ones i have used created big foams, but this guy is more of gel than foam.  I prefer it to be foamy than gel, so i guess it depends on who uses it.  However, I did love the scent on my face after using this product. It just smells manly, like girls would love it.  Maybe i just watched too many of their commercials.</li>
    <li> I liked the cool feeling and scent of this shaving gel. My husband complains that most shaving gels are hard to use since it slips out of your wet fingers. For whatever reason this one does not. It stays on the skin instead of slipping of and had a very refreshing feel and scent. That makes this favorite shaving gel so far.</li>
