      <li>I love this concealer!</li>
      <li>This leads too soo many sparkles on my hands because as I am using it the name comes off and it&#x27;s all over my hands!</li>
      <li>the consistency of the product as you blend and dab with your fingers creates a pretty flawless nice finish.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;d be good alone as a very light concealer</li>
      <li>Happily it doesn&#x27;t seem to accentuate fine lines.</li>
      <li>always amazingly blendable&lt;br /&gt;-Not</li>
      <li>I purchased the Dream Lumi in the color Nude, it&#x27;s a nice color</li>
      <li>I like the the product, it glides on and blends nicely.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply, easy to wash off, good color for fair skin.</li>
      <li>and I have a very light tan complexion.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Probably i would like a more liquidy , easily blendable, add as you want more, kind of product</li>
      <li>For many years now I have been using Touche Eclat by Yves Saint Laurent to brighten under eye circles.</li>
      <li>Its a highlighter basically so you wont be able to try and cover any pimples with it.</li>
      <li>I am pleased.</li>
      <li>This was not the case however with Dream Lumi and Touche Eclat is better.</li>
      <li>I just wish more came in a tube.</li>
      <li>and I use it to highlight more than conceal.</li>
      <li>love these concealers by maybelline.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll just use it more of a highlighter for my nose and cheek bones.</li>
      <li>Love love love.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite undereye concealer that I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
      <li>I love this</li>
      <li>Great product for those people with not too much of an under eye problem.</li>
      <li>Love this product and would recommend it.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a lot of staying power for covering blemishes, but for highlighting and contouring, it&#x27;s one of my favorite drugstore products.</li>
      <li>and I love having that highlighted look under my eyes and on my cheekbones.</li>
      <li>one of the better concealers out there.</li>
      <li>Love the applicator method.</li>
      <li>Great coverage for a cheap price and fast shipping!</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s also slightly pink tinted and this color matches my skin perfectly.</li>
      <li>I just think I got a shade a bit too light, but that&#x27;s ok,</li>
      <li>I also like how easy it is to use.</li>
      <li>The product is easy to apply and works well.</li>
      <li>This concealer is lightweight and easy to apply.</li>
      <li>Came very quickly.</li>
      <li>The highlighting formula works wonders, and it blends easily.</li>
      <li>and once I lighten I expect it to be fine .</li>
      <li>This highlighting concealer is easy to use and gives you light where you need it.  </li>
      <li>consistency is quite smooth, but sometimes doesn&#x27;t blend as easily as I&#x27;d like.</li>
      <li>Then this product sets into fine lines something that doesn&#x27;t happen with Touche Eclat.</li>
      <li>This color nude is great for those of us who have a yellow under tone.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s too light.</li>
      <li>Maybe the color I got was too light for me</li>
      <li>So I tried this out as an under eye concealer but the shade is too light of me.</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t think its that light.</li>
      <li>It makes me looks fresh and awake!</li>
      <li>The product is lighter than I expected it to be but it blends out great and does not settle in my crease</li>
      <li>The Dream Lumi is not a bad alternative to Touche Eclat, as it does brighten the eye area and did not cause any irritation.</li>
      <li>I got the recommendation from the blog Maskcara and quickly went through two tubes.</li>
      <li>For its price the Dream Lumi is adequate which is why I have given it three stars however I will not be purchasing it again.</li>
      <li>and I swear by their mascara&#x27;s, in my opinion they&#x27;re even better than the high end ones.</li>
      <li>But I do recommend this if someone wants light coverage and a highlighter.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the staying power--</li>
      <li>Its definitely worth the price.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Nice color, but make sure you get the right shade, there are about 3-5 different shades available</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;-Nicely blendable when using the right tools</li>
      <li>Its just the right weight and can be used all over your t-zone, under eyes, etc.</li>
      <li>finish is nice, and lasts long, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend layering this over a powder, so</li>
      <li>For someone with younger skin, this would probably be great, especially for the price.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and looks natural every time</li>
      <li>I might try again with a darker tone and maybe with primer first.</li>
      <li>So that is the only reason I gave it 3 stars instead of more.</li>
      <li>Gives pretty glowly look.</li>
      <li>You instantly look more awake.</li>
      <li>I have tried some pretty expensive concealers over the years and this one works the best for me.</li>
      <li>This product is absolutely amazing at covering under eye circles and any dark spots.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re also hereditary, which means I pretty much can&#x27;t get rid of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is a decent concealer for the price!</li>
      <li>(I don&#x27;t really recommend your fingers)&lt;br /&gt;-Good</li>
      <li>you never know how much product is in the brush.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I wanted to highlight my face but not too much</li>
      <li>Another thing that really bothers me is that the packaging of the product.</li>
      <li>really makes your skin glow</li>
      <li>If you have very oily skin</li>
      <li>Worked very well with my complexion.</li>
      <li>I really like this product</li>
      <li>i really like this shade for my skin tone.</li>
      <li>i use for the whole t-zone</li>
      <li>Really brightens up your eyes.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I got the nude and I have medium skin tone, and it works perfect for me.  I wanted to highlight my face but not too much and this works great!</li>
    <li> Worked very well with my complexion. With yellow undertones, this product helped tremendously to cover up my awful dark circles (hereditary). It stays all day long when paired with a setting powder, and truly does everything it says it does.</li>
    <li> The product is good, good coverage for undereye darkness and discoloration. I just think I got a shade a bit too light, but that&#x27;s ok, I&#x27;ve tanned over the summer and once I lighten I expect it to be fine . So that is the only reason I gave it 3 stars instead of more.</li>
    <li> I love this but I don&#x27;t use it as my only concealer. I have very dark circles and put a heavier concealer on under my eyes and then I put this along the circular &amp;#34;edge&amp;#34; of my dark circles. The illuminating/highlighting effect works very nice. It&#x27;d be good alone as a very light concealer but if you have heavier circles you would probably want to tag team this with a heavier concealer. Either way, it&#x27;s a very good product and you can use this also as a mid-day touch-up over your existing foundation/makeup etc. I like it and I&#x27;m not a big Maybelline fan!</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely amazing at covering under eye circles and any dark spots. It brightens up your eyes really well and makes you look wide awake. Its a highlighter basically so you wont be able to try and cover any pimples with it. Its definitely worth the price. However, it does start to crease under my eyes after a couple hours. It starts to wear off but stays on for a decent amount of time. Another thing that really bothers me is that the packaging of the product. Because of continuous use,the brand name written on the pen-like product comes off.This leads too soo many sparkles on my hands because as I am using it the name comes off and it&#x27;s all over my hands! And when i use my hands to apply it on my face, i see glitter and sparkles all over my face! The packaging is not good but the product itself is amazing.</li>
    <li> Came very quickly. I love this concealer!</li>
    <li> I am a little concerned how quickly it will run out based on the amount of clicks it requires to get product out, but the product itself does what it is suppose to. It isnt a heavy concealer and I use it to highlight more than conceal.</li>
    <li> I tried this I have tried tons of concealer a I have been fortunate enough to inherit the chronic  dark circles of a zombie ! This worked well a little goes a long way I am a medium yellowish tone except under my eyes of course I tried nude and did the job well a went a shade lighter due to the pigment under my eyes being darker significantly it worked well and covered well too if you have puffiness the lighter shades tend to show it through a little more.</li>
    <li> For many years now I have been using Touche Eclat by Yves Saint Laurent to brighten under eye circles. I was curious to see if a cheaper product could provide similar results. I like Maybelline and I swear by their mascara&#x27;s, in my opinion they&#x27;re even better than the high end ones. This was not the case however with Dream Lumi and Touche Eclat is better. I purchased the Dream Lumi in the color Nude, it&#x27;s a nice color and I was happy with how it looked on me. Unfortunately it&#x27;s hard to apply as way too much product comes out at once. There&#x27;s either no product at all on the brush or a large amount of it, which is a waste as only a little is needed for under the eyes. Then this product sets into fine lines something that doesn&#x27;t happen with Touche Eclat. The staying power is average and the consistency is a little too thin. For its price the Dream Lumi is adequate which is why I have given it three stars however I will not be purchasing it again. The Dream Lumi is not a bad alternative to Touche Eclat, as it does brighten the eye area and did not cause any irritation.</li>
    <li> I have always used YSL Touché éclat #3 but it is outrageously expensive so I am continually on the hunt for something less expensive. This is pretty good but not great for me personally. It covers dark circles nicely but is a little dry and more matte than I like (I have &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; dry skin with some fine lines).  Happily it doesn&#x27;t seem to accentuate fine lines. A little goes a long way. The color is a little light for me (medium tone Asian skin) but is close enough to be usable and it doesn&#x27;t cause raccoon eyes. I might try again with a darker tone and maybe with primer first. For someone with younger skin, this would probably be great, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> The product is lighter than I expected it to be but it blends out great and does not settle in my crease</li>
    <li> First off, let me start by telling you that I have severe dark circles. They&#x27;re also hereditary, which means I pretty much can&#x27;t get rid of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I didn&#x27;t buy this to act as my normal concealer, just for some extra brightness. This product does definitely give brightness to the under eye area without looking fluorescent or fake. This particular shade has a peachy undertone and really compliments my golden-toned skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is quite smooth, but sometimes doesn&#x27;t blend as easily as I&#x27;d like. I suggest using a damp sponge or a buffing brush to blend this under your eyes or even around your face for a very natural and flawless-looking highlight, like on the bridge of your nose, chin, between your brows, and on the tops of your cheekbones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The finish is nice, and lasts long, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend layering this over a powder, so wait until you&#x27;ve applied this to set your face if you normally do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Nice color, but make sure you get the right shade, there are about 3-5 different shades available&lt;br /&gt;-Gives brightness to the face, but not a ton of coverage&lt;br /&gt;-Nicely blendable when using the right tools (I don&#x27;t really recommend your fingers)&lt;br /&gt;-Good finish and lasting power. If you have very oily skin I recommend setting with a powder if you don&#x27;t already.&lt;br /&gt;-Very affordable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Not always amazingly blendable&lt;br /&gt;-Not a lot of coverage (IMO)&lt;br /&gt;-Not a lot of product in the tube</li>
    <li> Love love love. Easy to use and looks natural every time</li>
    <li> This is truly the best highlighting concealer on the market.  This color nude is great for those of us who have a yellow under tone.</li>
    <li> Been using this brand for years! Love this product and would recommend it. Great coverage for a cheap price and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> This is a decent concealer for the price! I also like how easy it is to use. I am pleased.</li>
    <li> I have tried some pretty expensive concealers over the years and this one works the best for me. Is extremely creamy .</li>
    <li> I use this as a brightener for under my eyes and along my brow bones. It makes me looks fresh and awake! I love it! Great for HAC.</li>
    <li> This highlighting concealer is easy to use and gives you light where you need it.  It definitely doesn&#x27;t disappoint.  I wbuy it again.</li>
    <li> the consistency of the product as you blend and dab with your fingers creates a pretty flawless nice finish. I found no residue or happy wrinkles afterwards, that i know of. one of the better concealers out there. although it was a little too light for me, i mixed it with a darker concealer i had. but really good nonetheless.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite undereye concealer that I&#x27;ve ever tried. I got the recommendation from the blog Maskcara and quickly went through two tubes. I have very dark circles, so I apply it in a large triangle under my eyes. The highlighting formula works wonders, and it blends easily. You instantly look more awake. It doesn&#x27;t have a lot of staying power for covering blemishes, but for highlighting and contouring, it&#x27;s one of my favorite drugstore products.</li>
    <li> I really like this product The only reason why I give it 4 stars is because it does not really conceal my under eye dark circles as well as I hoped. I have to apply a lot around that area to cover it up, but even then It not the best concealer. Maybe the color I got was too light for me but I don&#x27;t think its that light. I got the color nude and I have a very light tan complexion. But this works as a great highlighter and I love having that highlighted look under my eyes and on my cheekbones. So maybe I&#x27;m thinking of putting a different concealer under my eyes and using this over it and everywhere else i want to highlight. But I do recommend this if someone wants light coverage and a highlighter.</li>
    <li> So I tried this out as an under eye concealer but the shade is too light of me. I like the the product, it glides on and blends nicely. I probably just picked the wrong shade so it&#x27;s too light. I&#x27;ll just use it more of a highlighter for my nose and cheek bones.</li>
    <li> love these concealers by maybelline.  I put it on let it sit for a minute than tap tap tap</li>
    <li> Should have bought the next darker color....totally my fault....but this is a great concealer/highlighter....works especially well on my mouth wrinkles and eye circles (gosh, that sounds depressing....). I like it and will continue using it!</li>
    <li> I tried applying this under my eyes, but it immediately started burning.  I&#x27;ve never been sensitive to makeup before, but if you are I&#x27;d avoid this product.</li>
    <li> I have pale skin but it&#x27;s also slightly pink tinted and this color matches my skin perfectly. The product is easy to apply and works well. I got it 3-4 months ago and have been using it daily on a few spots on my face and I still seem to have plenty left. Oh, and it works well for brightening up dark circles under your eyes.</li>
    <li> great for contouring! really makes your skin glow</li>
    <li> This concealer is lightweight and easy to apply. finishes soft and keeps almost 6-8 hours. Hides dirk cycles very good!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price. Pair this highlighting concealer with a primer and it looks flawless! Really brightens up your eyes.</li>
    <li> The concealer works exceptionally well with a sponge. They blend out so well and hold my translucent powder until night time!</li>
    <li> i really like this shade for my skin tone. the coverage is awesome. I just wish more came in a tube. i use for the whole t-zone</li>
    <li> Although its a &amp;#34;highlighting conceler&amp;#34; its surprisingly not too shimmery or heavy. Its just the right weight and can be used all over your t-zone, under eyes, etc. My only negative comment is that it doesn&#x27;t come with much in the package.</li>
    <li> Great product for those people with not too much of an under eye problem. Doesn&#x27;t crease. Lightweight. Good colour range. Illuminating without looking overly shiny and no sparkles. Love the applicator method.</li>
    <li> I like this concealer but I bought it to go around the&lt;br /&gt;eyes and it doen&#x27;t cover as well there.</li>
    <li> This item looked like it was expired.  It was sticky and all cracked and flaked looking.  Disgusting....I will shop retail for makeup from now on.</li>
    <li> It is like a pen . Brush is along with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But you never know how much product is in the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will have to rub lots off on your hand and then apply on under the eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still it feels like there is lots of product under the eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this is the problem i faced with all Pen concealers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably i would like a more liquidy , easily blendable, add as you want more, kind of product</li>
    <li> Really good for under eye coverage and highlighting.  Easy to apply, easy to wash off, good color for fair skin.</li>
    <li> I like the color, brush, brightening effect, and smoothness.  I&#x27;m not crazy about the staying power-- it needs to be re-applied quite a bit, even with powder over it.  And the product only takes up half the tube, so the size seems deceptive.  A brand new one, once you twist until it starts coming out, is literally only half of the tube, and that&#x27;s a bummer.  But I do like it enough to recommend it.</li>
    <li> I use it as a highlighter for bridge of my nose and cheekbones. Gives pretty glowly look.</li>
