<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Granddaughter&#x27;s Christmas gift.  Loved it</li>
    <li> This was a wonderful buy of a favorite scent!  Fast shipping and can&#x27;t beat the price.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have used Pure Turquoise since it was first introduced. At that time I could buy in  at most upscale department stores. Then it became scarce so now I have to order it online.  I was surprised that very few of the perfume specialty websites stock it. Thanks Amazon,   I am ordering the biggest bottle available on here. Please Ralph Lauren, do not discontinue  this wonderful fragrance. It&#x27;s perfect whether wearing jeans or a little black dress.</li>
    <li> Perfume box looked like it was thrown under a stack of books for a year before it was sold; so don&#x27;t plan on giving the perfume as a gift unless you plan to unwrap it for the person you&#x27;re giving it to.  Perfume was same as advertised.</li>
    <li> I bought this fragance for gf she really loves. I will recommend it to everyone who needs a good fragance</li>
    <li> I love the products that I ordered, they where EXACTLY what I was looking for. I planned to travel with them as a gift for my friends. I ordered them 7 days b4 my trip and I will very worried if I will receive them before I travel; luckily for my I received my products 3 days after my order... so everything worked out fine for me.     Am happy with my sellers that my product was shipped on time, and I receive them right on time. I will buy from them again.</li>
    <li> Excellent service, excellent product. I was amazed at the speediness of the service. Thequality of the product was exceptional. I am telling all of my friends that this is a deal they can&#x27;t miss.</li>
    <li> Pure Turquoise is a clear, clean floral scent, then dries to a woody scent. On the one hand, it&#x27;s almost like touching a turquoise stone - cool. On the other hand, it seems like an aquatic floral on me. My skin amplifies the white florals - orange blossom, lily, catcus flowers, plus rose. Dries to a vanilla woody scent, but in a bizarre twist, RL Pure Turquoise often reminds me of brandy &amp; coke. I like it but it&#x27;s too floral in the heart and too weak at the base for me to love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me, Pure Turquoise isn&#x27;t the American Southwest, but it does transport me to another place. It&#x27;s more like a white floral symphony next to the ocean, complete with deep breaths of fresh air &amp; ocean wind blowing in my hair. I can see &amp; smell sand, but it&#x27;s marine sand not desert sand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pure Turquoise wears close to the skin with good longevity. Once dried &amp; the florals have had their say, it&#x27;s close to a second skin on me. I consider it a personal indulgence or an experience, rather than a scent that projects an image, style, or personality. Personally, I like it, but it doesn&#x27;t always wear well on me. When I don&#x27;t care for it, it&#x27;s too white floral in the heart and too weak at the base for me to love. Otherwise, it&#x27;s 5* all the way.</li>
    <li> The only one for my sweetie.</li>
    <li> I am so glad to find this on Amazon. It is my all time favorite perfume! It is hard for me to describe the scent. It has a clean and crisp yet dressy scent. I know that doesn&#x27;t make sense. It is not floral or fruity, which I don&#x27;t like so if you can&#x27;t stand fruit or floral, this scent is for you. I love it!</li>
    <li> The perfect Mothers Day present. Harder to find since it is no longer carried in the major stores. Price for the 4.3oz bottle was cheaper on Amazon than the 2.3 bottle purchased at a specialty store.</li>
    <li> Last year I was disappointed to find out that department stores no longer carried Pure Turquoise by Ralph Lauren (and I thought it had been discontinued).  I saw it on Amazon but figured that it may be discontinued stock and no longer resemble the fragrance that I grew to love.  Last week I searched the Ralph Lauren website and found it (although, it wasn&#x27;t easy), so I came back to good old Amazon to order it.  I got it a few days ago and it was still the soft, long-lasting, feminine scent that I enjoy (and get several compliments on).  Thanks Amazon for carrying it at an unbeatable price!</li>
    <li> I love the scent of Pure Turquoise and have been disappointed to find it is not carried in department stores anymore. I was very happy to discover it on Amazon and hope this means that the production of it has not been discontinued entirely. I received my order in the mail a few days after purchase and am very happy with it. Hopefully, I can continue to buy it here in the future!</li>
    <li> This fragrance is WONDERFUL. I am very sensitive to most perfumes, as many of them give me headaches. This one is unique, clean, refreshing, and just PERFECT. Hopefully it will continue to be available, because it has become one of my top 5 faves.</li>
    <li> I love this scent, Ralph Lauren&#x27;s Pure Turquoise! The scent isnt too strong, isnt too weak, and isnt too much like a little girl. Its a scent for a woman and it lasts all day long for me! I cant put it on in the afternoon before work, go home and its still there when I get home to relax from a long day at work.</li>
    <li> I am so disappointed to hear that production has stopped and Amazon does not sell this item anymore. I have enjoyed wearing it for many years now.</li>
    <li> I love this cologne. It has a fresh, clean scent. It also has a sexiness about it as well. Great for day or evening. I would highly recommend this one.</li>
    <li> one of my favorite perfumes! its very clean and fresh with a hint of sweetness!</li>
    <li> I have used this since it first came out (2005? 2006?)  and I have loved it ever since.  It was $100 for a 1.7 oz. bottle when it first came out and I just purchased the 4.2 oz. bottle for $30!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s a little harsh for summertime but in Winter and Fall or when it&#x27;s cold (here is Seattle that&#x27;s about 75% of the time) it&#x27;s an awesome perfume!  It has more staying power than most of the other perfumes I own (I&#x27;m typing this at 4:00pm and I have been able to smell it since I put it on at 7:00am!)  I have a lot of perfumes including many Britney Spears ones, Ralph Lauren&#x27;s Ralph, &amp; Hot, Armani Code, etc. and this one is by far my favorite.  It has a mature, sophisticated scent to it while still appropriate for someone my age to wear (24).  LOVE THIS! :)</li>
    <li> I love this fresh scent. It is feminine without being too floral and sweet.  I wish they continued to make the entire line.</li>
    <li> WOW, you cannot beat this price anyhwere , this is the best house of Lauren fragrence- great for spring and summer.</li>
    <li> I bought this, since I like the Lauren by Ralph Lauren scent, so I thought I would try something different. This is a nice scent, not too strong, and not too light.</li>
    <li> Not all stores carry this scent, but SHOULD! My favorite by far, this perfume always takes me above the clouds where the air is mixed with earth&#x27;s most special places... Caribbean waters, Arizona sunsets, Sequoia shaded forests. An outdoors scent with a hint of citris. LOVE it!</li>
    <li> I love this perfume, it has perfect smell [not too strong nor not to low] for me. It stays on you all day and this is the best perfume I have ever used. Its hard to see that no major stores carry this perfume anymore. I would recommend this product for anyone who are looking for the good one.</li>
    <li> She loves it and was super simple to send to her since she is so far away during the holidays</li>
    <li> I wish that they would reconsider selling this scent in stores again, because there is no other scent that compares to it as far as I&#x27;m concern. It&#x27;s a one of a kind.</li>
    <li> I had a bottle of this perfume from years ago and my Mom smelled it and loved it, so I gave her the rest.  About a week after I smelled her wearing it and really missed it.  I didn&#x27;t want to ask for it back, so I purchased this one and I&#x27;ve been wearing it non-stop for the hot weather.  It smells refreshing and has a really distinct scent.  Clean and perfect.</li>
    <li> Once fragance is sprayed on it last a minute,you can&#x27;t smell it on your skin or clothes, I am very disappointed, Is this replica of Ralph Lauren</li>
    <li> I wore this perfume years years ago and the scent is the best! The perfume was discontinue in the department stores. And a friend told me to go on Amazon. Yeepie to my friend Willis...</li>
    <li> My Wife Loved It!  I had been looking in the stores for this for a while and finally found it online.  YaHoo!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to buy this perfume forever! I had a much smaller bottle of this and I was treasuring the remaining few drops in there, thinking that I will never be able to get another bottle. BUT despite of some negative reviews that say it smells stale or like alcohol we did purchase it, and I do not regret it! It smells perfect! Just as my other one from a department store! Go for it!</li>
    <li> This was a Mother&#x27;s Day gift for my wife - her favorite fragrance and HARD to find.  She was thrilled and I was king! Great price, fairly quick delivery.</li>
    <li> i did think the smell was the real kind like i have need a refund, not happy with product. Thank You</li>
    <li> I love the sent ,it&#x27;s. One of my favorite I give it a 10</li>
    <li> ...to find out that the perfume I bought for Mom for Christmas was OLD.  She is in the hospital and will be receiving hospice care, I finally found this perfume (her favorite) here and had it shipped. While visiting for an early Mother&#x27;s Day surprise, found the perfume.  It&#x27;s old! It&#x27;s yellowed, and even smells old, not like the original. She didn&#x27;t have the heart to tell me as she knew I&#x27;d looked for it for so long.  So sad.</li>
    <li> I was sad when Ralph Lauren discontinued this.  I have been pleased to find it at Amazon and at a slighty better price than my local department store.  I find it to be a light summery scent and wear all the time in spring and summer.</li>
    <li> This is the only perfume I have used since it was introduced 5-6 years ago.It is a light fresh scent that is neither overpowering or cloying. I would recemmend this perfume to anyone who likes a unique, fresh scent. Unfortunately, Ralph Lauren no longer makes this perfume. I wish, wish, wish Lauren would bring this scent back.Thank you Amazon for restocking my supply!</li>
    <li> I wish Ralph Lauren would brong this wonderful fragrance back to life in his line. It is a gentle scent and I get many compliments when wearing it.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product and the larger product size is a perfect way to buy.  This was a well received birthday gift.  The price is very competitive.</li>
    <li> This is a sporty, yet, fresh smelling fragerance</li>
    <li> Wife Birthday Present. She cannot find it most places. It is always a surprise for her.</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume, best price</li>
    <li> Being a lover of Ralph Lauren fragrances for men I was curious about getting this for my wife since this particular perfume is not sold in the country where we live.  It turned out to be much better than expected.  Elegant yet still very juvenile.</li>
    <li> I searched to find the best price for the 4.2oz and you had it...would order it again in the future.</li>
    <li> my signature fragrance.</li>
    <li> My favorite scent. To</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before. I&#x27;m sad it&#x27;s being discontinued!&lt;br /&gt;Anyone who wears this will love it and others love smelling it on you!</li>
    <li> Finding original Lauren is difficult and this my wife&#x27;s next favorite fragrance. She will always buy this or Lauren when she can find it.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best fragrances made by ralph lauren, my wife has been wearing it for years. I only buy if its sold and shipped by amazon. Thanks amazon for a good product and affordable price.</li>
    <li> My sister introduced me to this several years ago.  I wear it daily and have received numerous compliments. It&#x27;s lovely.</li>
    <li> Recently  a coworker of mine came to work wearing this fragrance and several of us were asking what she was wearing it was a lovely fragrance?  She told me it was Pure Turquoise although she thought it was discontinued.  Sadly, she was correct, I looked everywhere at all of the local better retailers.&lt;br /&gt; Happily Amazon came through again not only did they have it, but they had the larger size at a great price...Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> I have loved Turquoise since seeing it by chance at Lord&amp;Taylor NYC when there for a business trip years ago. It is now almost impossible to find -- evidently discontinued - so I am very happy to find it here. The scent is light and perfect for everyday wear and I have always been complimented on it.  It is not sickening sweet or overpowering like so many others. Your perfume should not walk into a room before you do!</li>
    <li> I like this perfume but would not recommend to another unless they have smelled first, because my likes are not for everyone.</li>
    <li> Pure Turquoise arrived and was just as expected. I&#x27;m under the impression it has been discontinued in dept. stores so I ordered it here. Not only was it cheaper but I got a bigger size. Smells great and no difference between my amazon perfume and the \\&quot;department store\\&quot; perfume.</li>
    <li> I remember this perfume from years ago and I looked it up and  found it....smell the same as I remembered it!</li>
    <li> receive my package after they sent it to the wrong address but now that I have it I love it it smells so wonderful I work out to dinner last night and my husband loved  .  It</li>
    <li> I get so many compliments on this perfume. I love that it is not a common fragrance; I like to be unique!</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted !!!!</li>
    <li> Pure Turquoise was gift to friends  who just love the smell of it. Very light and not heavy.</li>
    <li> Love it and price was great!!</li>
    <li> Pure Turquoise by Ralph Lauren its a great parfum. it has  a very unique aroma.its not sweet. its not fresh like citrus. its very elegant. /the price is good, and the size too,its 125ml/ i will order it again for sure.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume by Ralph Lauren.  I am so glad I found it Amazon.  Looked everywhere for it but found it here!</li>
    <li> Bought previously from a department store, but lives up to its name via Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Can only truly be appreciated after a woman has worn it an hour or two. Absolutley amazing. From the bottle or on a card or your wrist you can tell nothing about it. It&#x27;s not flowery, nor fruity, but is more deep and powerful than this.&lt;br /&gt;This is an evening scent, and possibly the finest of its kind. For a daytime scent, I might suggest Escada for a number of its lively scents.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite scents. I think it&#x27;s great for the summer and the winter months.  It reminds me of the way my mom used to smell when she came home from the department store when I was little.  That might sound weird, but it&#x27;s a comforting scent to me.  It&#x27;s very fresh and clean.  It layers well with vanilla scented creams, too (at least on me).</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite cologne, although I am a Ralph Lauren junkie in general, I love his elegant fragrances. It never ceases to amaze me how many times I get compliments whenever I wear Pure Turquoise, the scent is such a classic that appeals to everyone. I have been wearing this for many years, it&#x27;s my &amp;#34;warm weather&amp;#34; scent that I never tire of. If you&#x27;re looking for a distinctively feminine fragrance that is modern, clean, and fresh, you&#x27;ll enjoy Pure Turquoise. What does it smell like?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;#34;A perfume from Ralph Lauren crowned with the precious stone turquoise is named after it - Turquoise. The fragrance is rich and opulent. It opens with black current blossom, soft powdery – velvety violet leaf, lily-of-the-valley and cactus flower Cereus that flourishes at night. The heart is floral and composed of orange blossom, Bulgarian rose and desert lily. The base brings patchouli, birch, amber, powdery – soft vanilla Bourbon and narcotic rum.&amp;#34; ~ Fragrantica</li>
    <li> I hope Ralph Lauren never stops producing this exciting, sensual perfume.  I love it and buy several bottles at a time, just so I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
    <li> llego bien pronto y sin bien seguro no roto ni derramado ,  ya he comprado 3 frascos. me gusta mucho</li>
