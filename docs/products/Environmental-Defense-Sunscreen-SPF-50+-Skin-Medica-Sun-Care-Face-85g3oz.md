    <li> Love this product.  Doesn&#x27;t make my face shiny and I have very oily skin.</li>
    <li> As usual, SkinMedica hits it out of the park. I LOVE this sunscreen. I love the way my skin looks when I wear this sunscreen.  I look forward to putting it on everyday.  Does not clog pores.  Wonderful!</li>
    <li> Love it, Great product</li>
    <li> a little pricey but well worth it. I cycle frequently and this sunscreen holds up for a good while even in hot weather.</li>
    <li> Love it and highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I got turned on to this after doing an IPL (laser facial) last year.  It is really effective and still feels like nothing on my face... not greasy at all.  It&#x27;s the only sunblock I&#x27;ve ever tried that doesn&#x27;t feel thick or greasy on my face.  I put this on every day on top of my moisturizer (and foundation when I wear any) and my skin looks great and not shiny at all.  It&#x27;s worth the money.  One bottle lasts me a long time, like months, and I use it on my chest, neck and face at least once a day (more when I&#x27;m at the beach).</li>
    <li> SkinMedica makes great products and this is no exception. I use it daily as my facial lotion.</li>
    <li> Not as good moisturizing. Thicker than expected.</li>
    <li> My wife states it works as described.  She likes all Skin Medica products</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  All products from this company are great</li>
    <li> This sunscreen was recommended by an esthetician for my face and neck, and it works beautifully without causing any reaction to my sensitive skin.  I&#x27;m a tennis player, and fair skinned so it is essential to cover up with protection. I only use this product now for my face and neck.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted - works great.</li>
    <li> I break out when I use most sunscreens on my face.  I was handed this at a family outing and never broke out.  I won&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
    <li> Works as advertised and does not leave your skin looking white or washed out</li>
    <li> This 50 SPF is not without odor as the 30 SPF is. I can&#x27;t use it on my face as intended.</li>
    <li> So far I like it. Absorbs quickly and clear. No white residue with the zinc oxide.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful sunscreen. It does not have a scent which I like. It also very moisturizing. Perfect for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I like this sunscreen so far</li>
    <li> Best I have ever used</li>
    <li> the only sunblock that doesn&#x27;t burn my face.</li>
