      <li>My with it.girl happy</li>
      <li>Love this!!</li>
      <li>product lasts all day, which is a pleasant difference.  </li>
      <li>I received it very quickly and was quite happy!</li>
      <li>It also makes a good semi water proof eyeshadow for all of you ladies with veiny eyelids like me.</li>
      <li>I love this discontinued product!</li>
      <li>and i love it!</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product!</li>
      <li>It works well and goes on nicely.  </li>
      <li>This particular color is VERY light on the skin, and would probably be best as a primer, but i love how it looks, and could probably be layered to look brighter.</li>
      <li>I love it : )</li>
      <li>I love that this product is primer and shadow all in one.  </li>
      <li>I have tried many eye shadows that say they don&#x27;t crease, but end of day</li>
      <li>I going to go look for more.</li>
      <li>I love this product but with it being discontinued has anyone found an equivalent both in blaze beige color and (mostly) in cost?  </li>
      <li>THANK YOU True Beauty for carrying my favorite eye shadow!  </li>
      <li>This eye shadow is my favorite with a little shimmer and perfectly blendable</li>
      <li>It does crease by the end of the day but is easily smeared out.</li>
      <li>I ususally put it in the inside corners of my eyes and lightly on my eyelids.</li>
      <li>I really wish they would introduce more colors.</li>
      <li>And all night and the next day if you&#x27;re having that kind of day.</li>
      <li>Everything seems to be in the $20 range and still not the right color.</li>
      <li>For me it is only a primer to even out skin tone and to make eyeshadow color more true.</li>
      <li>was okay with spending a little more knowing it was discontinued..</li>
      <li>I love it and will not go back to using Clinque touchbase again.</li>
      <li>I also like to layer it with other eyeshadows for a more made up look.</li>
      <li>Love this and the dark brown.  </li>
      <li>no matter how much I put on, I couldn&#x27;t get any colour payoff (and I have super pale skin).</li>
      <li>This is the best shadow to use as base.</li>
      <li>Not only does the shadow last a really long time, but you don&#x27;t have to use very much on your eye so the bottle does too.</li>

<li> So much for this being primer and shadow - not sure what it was supposed to be, but I immediately threw mine in the garbage.</li>
<li> I can put off having to go thru the trial &amp; error of finding a new shadow that suits me a little while longer.</li>
<li> however I was super disappointed when I was shopping at Big Lots the other day and found this exact same product for only $2!&lt;br /&gt;Needless</li>
<li> It also keeps eyeshadow on all day long.</li>
<li> I put this on and then pat some loose powder on and it stays un-creased until I take it off.  </li>
<li> A half hour later, when I looked in the mirror, there was nothing on my lids and my undereye area looked shiny.</li>
<li> It works as a great base with some color and my eyeshadow goes on so well over it!</li>
<li> It just sort of made my eyelids look wet.</li>
<li> Total waste of money.</li>
<li> This is my holy grail eyeshadow base - I simply haven&#x27;t been able to find an equivalent.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> It provides a nice shimmer base also.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used this eye shadow for the last several years but am unable to find it in the stores locally anymore.</li>
<li> Will definitly purchase the other colors.</li>
<li> As far as I can tell this is the only primer/base product out there without going to an expensive brand</li>
<li> This is a terrific product, not sure why it&#x27;s become so hard to find.  </li>
<li> I usually get irritation or have allergies to eye makeup.  </li>
<li> This is my go to product for making my eyes look less tired and brighter.</li>
<li> Sorry Clinique.</li>
<li> I use this as a base coat, then a darker powder eye shadow on the brow bone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I used Clinique touch base in canvas for &gt;10 years</li>
<li> I use it as a base</li>

    <li> I bought this as soon as i could and i love it! This particular color is VERY light on the skin, and would probably be best as a primer, but i love how it looks, and could probably be layered to look brighter. Will definitly purchase the other colors.</li>
    <li> I love that this product is primer and shadow all in one.  I usually get irritation or have allergies to eye makeup.  I even tried more expensive hypoallergenic brands and had to throw them out.  This is the only eyeshadow I can wear all day.</li>
    <li> For me it is only a primer to even out skin tone and to make eyeshadow color more true. I used Clinique touch base in canvas for &gt;10 years and then this product came out. As far as I can tell this is the only primer/base product out there without going to an expensive brand and I looked for years trying to cut costs of having to use Clinique. This product lasts alot longer too and doesn&#x27;t require you to use your fingers for application since it has a convenient wand. It does crease by the end of the day but is easily smeared out. I love it and will not go back to using Clinque touchbase again. Sorry Clinique. Hello Covergirl!!! I did also experience the burning feeling but did not associate it with this product until I read someone else&#x27;s review that mentioned a similar feeling.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! It works as a great base with some color and my eyeshadow goes on so well over it! One of my staple items now!</li>
    <li> Love this and the dark brown.  I have tried many eye shadows that say they don&#x27;t crease, but end of day it&#x27;s all in the crease of my eye lid.  I put this on and then pat some loose powder on and it stays un-creased until I take it off.  Even next morning it&#x27;s still intact.</li>
    <li> This eye shadow is my favorite with a little shimmer and perfectly blendable</li>
    <li> Love this!! I use it as a base and it&#x27;s perfect!! It also makes a good semi water proof eyeshadow for all of you ladies with veiny eyelids like me. It also keeps eyeshadow on all day long. And all night and the next day if you&#x27;re having that kind of day. Good product can&#x27;t do my makeup without it!</li>
    <li> This is the best shadow to use as base. It helps rest of eye shadow stick and stay longer. It provides a nice shimmer base also.</li>
    <li> I love this discontinued product! This is my holy grail eyeshadow base - I simply haven&#x27;t been able to find an equivalent.&lt;br /&gt;I was okay with spending a little more knowing it was discontinued..however I was super disappointed when I was shopping at Big Lots the other day and found this exact same product for only $2!&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say I stocked up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this eye shadow for the last several years but am unable to find it in the stores locally anymore. THANK YOU True Beauty for carrying my favorite eye shadow!  I can put off having to go thru the trial &amp; error of finding a new shadow that suits me a little while longer.</li>
    <li> I got this in Beige Blaze and tried it immediately on naked eyelids. no matter how much I put on, I couldn&#x27;t get any colour payoff (and I have super pale skin). It just sort of made my eyelids look wet. A half hour later, when I looked in the mirror, there was nothing on my lids and my undereye area looked shiny. So much for this being primer and shadow - not sure what it was supposed to be, but I immediately threw mine in the garbage. Total waste of money.</li>
    <li> Delivers as advertised. Family owned. Will buy here again.</li>
    <li> Just watch out that you apply evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product lasts all day, which is a pleasant difference.  I use this as a base coat, then a darker powder eye shadow on the brow bone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t want metallic, then this isn&#x27;t the product for you.  This shadow shimmers.</li>
    <li> Not only does the shadow last a really long time, but you don&#x27;t have to use very much on your eye so the bottle does too. I really wish they would introduce more colors.</li>
    <li> I love this product but with it being discontinued has anyone found an equivalent both in blaze beige color and (mostly) in cost?  Everything seems to be in the $20 range and still not the right color. Help!!!  Product specifics and location on where to purchase will be helpful.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find it anywhere. I like it. Do recommend it. I going to go look for more. My with it.girl happy</li>
    <li> This is a terrific product, not sure why it&#x27;s become so hard to find.  It works well and goes on nicely.  I received it very quickly and was quite happy!</li>
    <li> This is my go to product for making my eyes look less tired and brighter. I ususally put it in the inside corners of my eyes and lightly on my eyelids. I put an eyelid primer under if I want it to last all day but it lasts well even without the primer. I also like to layer it with other eyeshadows for a more made up look. I love it : )</li>
