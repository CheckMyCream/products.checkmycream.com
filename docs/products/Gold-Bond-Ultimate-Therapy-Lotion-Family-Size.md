<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Thick and creamy with no greasy after effects. Absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t smell perfumy. The best moisturizer I&#x27;ve found for my family&#x27;s dry skin. Works well for the guys and for me.</li>
    <li> Love this product, but received bottle with a pump that did not work!</li>
    <li> I really like this brand</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t leave home without it! Dry skin is a thing of the past.</li>
    <li> This lotion works very well on my son&#x27;s skin.  He has eczema, and it treats it and keeps it away when i use it daily.</li>
    <li> Really good lotion. Only one that we have found that actually works on my husbands extremely dry and itchy skin.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Fair price.  Shipped free within two days (PRIME) makes me happy</li>
    <li> As advertised. Good value.</li>
    <li> This product moisturizes as promised, the issue I have is, I used it once and my nostrils became extremely irritated. I&#x27;m very sensitive to fragrances and the scent of this is way too strong and overpowering for me.  I normally check to see that the bottle says unscented but I was rushing on my way out the store and I usually find that drug store lotions that focus on dry skin are unscented. I&#x27;m disappointed to say the least, I don&#x27;t know why adding scent is necessary unless a person is specially looking for a perfumed lotion.</li>
    <li> Great healing lotion.  I have very dry skin, and this is soothing, pleasantly fragrance-free, and leaves no greasy or sticky residue of any kind.  The product is 5-star all the way, but the packaging is slightly problematic.  Due to the thickness of the lotion, the pump will not work on the last 1/4 of the product.  A bottom-capped squeeze bottle would allow use of all of the product without wasting any.</li>
    <li> If you live in a state where winters are rough,  you most likely suffer from dry skin.  This does a great  job healing dry skin.  It has a very neutral clean smell, none of that perfume stuff.  It just works!  Nuff said.</li>
    <li> Works great. Shipped as promised.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I have eczema and this stuff keeps it under control. It is amazing. The smell is nice, though some people do not like it.</li>
    <li> Nice to have this harsh New England winter.</li>
    <li> This cream is by far the best I&#x27;ve tried! Since I usually avoid using products with fragrance, I was a bit hesitant to try this. Now that I have, I&#x27;m glad I did! The fragrance is very light and pleasant, and it almost disappears after application. It leaves your skin super soft and smooth, without that greasy feeling I hate. Plus, it stays on even after washing your hands. Thanks, gold bond, for such a great product!</li>
    <li> My skin has never felt better in the winter.</li>
    <li> This stuff is like magic healing cream for your hands.</li>
    <li> If you suffer from extremely dry skin this stuff is awesome. You may have to use it once in the morning and again at night but so worth it.</li>
    <li> It helped my dry hands.  I can&#x27;t say it was any better than any other product but it did the job and the price was fair.</li>
    <li> This lotion works great.  I love the rich texture of  it as well as its clean scent (no  menthol).I  use it  all over my skin after I bathe,  Mt skin stays soft and supple, despite living in a very dry building.  It relieves itching and dryness.  The ingredient, aloe, is what sold me.  I recommend this product to all normal to dry skin types.</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  Definitely worth the few extra $$ compared to much cheaper Stuff. With Goldbond Lotion, I only have to put on 1-2X a day versus, 4-5X a day with anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this is the 20oz Bottle versus the same stuff for the 14oz bottle at Walmart which costs $2 more than Amazon.  No brainer, especially since it&#x27;s free Prime shipping.  save yourself a few bucks and go through Amazon.</li>
    <li> This lotion makes your dry skin feel better.  You can use it anywhere on your whole body.</li>
    <li> We have very hard water and one of my previous doctors suggested my trying this--so far so good and it has a very pleasant, light scent.</li>
    <li> A very effective lotion, calming and healing.  It smells good too.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Combats dryness during the cold winter months.</li>
    <li> Although its ingredients are similar to Vaseline Intensive Care with Aloe, it is more concentrated and heals dry skin more quickly.</li>
    <li> I always need to use lotion after I shower due to drying of skin. It works great to prevent chapped skin and stays on even after washing your hands!</li>
    <li> Works great on my dry, itchy skin. I continue to buy this. First cream I buy more than once  :)</li>
    <li> Pump is inoperative.  Not worth returning item over but sure is a hassle to remove the pump each time for use.</li>
    <li> i cant live without it</li>
    <li> ALWAYS USE THIS ON MY SENSITIVE SKIN</li>
    <li> Historically, I tended to choose lotion by scent. But as someone working in the food industry, spending a lot of time with dogs, and going to school, I do a lot of showering and really frequent hand washing. Once I tried this lotion, I was sold and would trade the best scented lotion any day for a bottle of this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, I&#x27;ve found it really convenient to keep a bottle in my shower. Once I towel off, I apply it everywhere, even to the feet. It dries pretty quickly, and skin is left smooth and hydrated-- never sticky or greasy. The lotion does have a light clean scent, but not very noticeable so it&#x27;s just as useful for the whole family. If you are someone who prefers more scent, it is very easy to add just a few drops of your favorite scented oil to the lotion bottle and stir using the pump wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has been so helpful and has quickly become a must-have for me.  The bottle lasts a long time; you&#x27;ll find yourself needing to apply less often because it has a lasting moisture. The only thing that could be negative is that once you get down to 1/4 of a bottle, it becomes difficult to pump. I&#x27;ve actually begun combining this leftover lotion with other scented lotions to get the best of both worlds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product to anyone struggling with rough, dry, or irritated skin. Once you use it I think you&#x27;ll be sold.</li>
    <li> Best lotion available</li>
    <li> My skin has never felt this soft.</li>
    <li> Love all my Gold Bond lotions.  Battle dry skin and Gold Bond takes care of dry flakey skin.  Love love love Gold Bond😊</li>
    <li> It was used by my brother who has extremely dry skin (dry fish scales looking, dry skin cells peeling off, with some reddish patches or skin sores...I don&#x27;t know what to call it but it&#x27;s due to dryness). So only after or within a week of application as you would normally apply a lotion, it shows a very big improvement. The itchiness, dryness, soreness is more than 90% gone. It&#x27;s a real skin dryness healing therapy specially for this winter or cold weather days.&lt;br /&gt;I tried to use it also and it&#x27;s better than other lotions I&#x27;ve used. I will be ordering soon through Amazon once my current lotion that I&#x27;ve just bought is near finished.&lt;br /&gt;The best SOlotion so far ever used for extremely dry skin.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and It does give right moisture to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the problem I&#x27;m having is the pump. After using a few times, somehow the pump was broken and I couldn&#x27;t use it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;I just assume it is because of cream might be too thick?? I have 4 bottles at home and all of them have same issue.</li>
    <li> Buy a smaller bottle and you might have success with this product.  The lotion is so thick it won&#x27;t work it&#x27;s way thru the spout.  After lots of swearing at the bottle my girlfriend came in and put a competitors spout in and that worked fine.  I find it hard till give a product a good rating when you can&#x27;t get it out of the bottle.  It&#x27;s like rating a soft drink that&#x27;s in capless bottle. I like other gold bond products but this bottle designs falls very short.</li>
    <li> Fantastic. Very helpful for my sensitive skin after shaving.</li>
    <li> Lotion is great. I had a defective pump though so I had to either resort to squeezing hunks of lotion out through the top or dipping the pump straw and smearing it on my dry hands.</li>
    <li> Many say it is too thick but for me that consistency allows me to remain ash-free &amp; thoroughly moisturizes the skin for a soft, smooth feeling. A little bit more pricey than other brands but definitely worth it. I normally buy it from Drugstore.com with free shipping, however they were out of stock and I found it on Amazon for $0.03 cheaper. If you order it via Auto Ship you will receive an even deeper discount.</li>
    <li> I was using this between application of topical prescriptions, but find that sometimes I&#x27;ll use it instead.  More convenient and not as messy.</li>
    <li> Love this Lotion, it really does help with really, really dry skin just like they say it does. I&#x27;ve already re-ordered.</li>
    <li> I have had horrible dry skin since I was a little kid. I dread the winter months because the cold, dry outside air makes it even worse and so does turning the heat on. It has been worse than ever this year until I tried this lotion. Literally, within two days of using gold bond ultimate healing lotion my skin is almost completely back to normal! After 24 years of dry skin I finally found something that works!</li>
    <li> Recommended by pharmacist  to use for my daughter who has skin problem,,,psoriasis,,has been using in combination&lt;br /&gt;with Vitamin a ointment</li>
    <li> Great product. Already healing my dry skin on my knee.  And very large.</li>
    <li> to me this lotion is the best of all even Aveeno</li>
    <li> It does effectively moisturize, but this is a fairly greasy lotion. At this price point you can find lotions as effective without the greasy feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, it works as a body moisturizer and has done what I needed this winter. However, I think one is better off with Lubriderm or a drug store generic version of that.</li>
    <li> I have other creams that I use for my body but I tried this as a topping for my famous vanilla pudding instead of whipped cream and it was wonderful.  Also works well as a mayonnaise for various cold cut sandwiches.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS.  I use it all over my body daily.  It doesn&#x27;t leave any gross, sticky residue and smells pretty good too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s super moisturizing and it really does last, if not all day, most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside (this happens with any lotion I&#x27;ve found) is that in the summer heat, this stuff gets all over my leather seats in my car if I&#x27;m sweating.  That&#x27;s a pretty specific problem though, and not one that has deterred me from using this product.</li>
    <li> Perfect for the winter months.  Its thick consistency seems to last much longer than regular lotions.  I have extra dry skin and this works great for me.</li>
    <li> Great buy Great product</li>
    <li> Thicker than normal.  Great for hands.</li>
    <li> Use this regular on my hands and arms.</li>
    <li> When I got the bottle the pump did NOT work at all.</li>
    <li> Was recommended this lotion by a nurse during a extended hospital stay. They always no the trick. I absolutely love this location it&#x27;s quick drying, has a light feel and stays in even after a light hand rinse.</li>
    <li> Perfect for harsh winters. One of the best features about this lotion is after an application your hands aren&#x27;t left &amp;#34;oily.&amp;#34; I use daily to avoid dry and cracked skin throughout harsh winters. This size is a great value.</li>
    <li> The Gold Bond Ultimate Healing Skin Therapy Lotion is wonderful for my hands in the dry winter months. Also it is useful as a general hand lotion.</li>
    <li> Super Great Product !!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Works great used every other day on dry skin by a 70 year old man.</li>
    <li> Really good for my very dry skin.</li>
    <li> Gold Bond cured my dry hands in a matter of two days. At first touch; Gold Bond feels dry for a lotion but once you work it in, it just does the job so well and most important, it doesn&#x27;t leave your hands feeling oily!</li>
    <li> great price for the size!</li>
    <li> I have finally found a lotion that moisturizes and smells just right with any perfume that I may or may not be wearing. Feels great on skin and absorbs great.</li>
    <li> I began using lotion as my after-shave treatment years ago. After trying several different lotions, I&#x27;ve stuck with this Gold Bond. It absorbs quickly, does not feel greasy and I much prefer the very light scent over that of typical after-shave treatments, although I&#x27;d prefer no scent at all.&lt;br /&gt;  This lotion also works well for other typical uses of lotion: dry skin, rough spots, etc. Overall I think it is a great product at a fair price.</li>
    <li> Best lotion available!!!</li>
    <li> Love that its not greasy</li>
    <li> Great product.  Thick and rich.  I&#x27;m very happy with it and would recommend it.  Really big bottle.</li>
    <li> FANTASTIC!!! This is the first lotion that has helped my dry skin.  It worked so well I bought a bottle for my sister and one for my daughter.  Dry skin is real problem in my family and I am considered &amp;#34;smart&amp;#34; because it works so well.</li>
    <li> I like the lotion -- but the pump doesn&#x27;t work -- the lotion is really really thick (maybe old ? ? ) Absorbs quickly which is important to me as I don&#x27;t like &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; on my skin.</li>
    <li> It really helped my problem skin. I would suggest it for anyone with dry skin. It works immediately. Especially good for itchy skin.</li>
    <li> was so thick it will not pump</li>
    <li> this stuff works excellent</li>
    <li> This is our top pick for keeping our skin smooth without adding a strong scent or greasiness.  We apply it after a shower or bath while skin is still damp and it seals in moisture and keeps working a long time.  Although it costs more than some brands, you tend to use less to cover the same area, so it all evens out in the end.  With some cheaper brands, we end up using more lotion (and applying it more often), so this just makes more sense to buy.  Thank you, Gold Bond, for having such wonderful products!</li>
    <li> I am out in my garden daily doing this and that and often forget my gloves. That&#x27;s why I use Gold Bond Ultimate Healing Skin Therapy Lotion every day and my hands always look good. I also use it all over after I shower. I order it from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;It is really wonderful stuff!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s the only lotion that works on dry cracked winter skin.  It seems to heal as well.  We love it.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion. It is good for dry skin, chaffing &amp; irritated skin. Many uses. Smells good and not oily.</li>
    <li> We have been using GB for years....Amazing product with proven results. Your skin will appreciate the quality, feel, smell and it completes our daily skin scare...Outstanding!!!</li>
    <li> The pump did not work 😠</li>
    <li> Like the cream, but the dispenser broke after using it twice. Left with a container full of cream that is very difficult to get out.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite everyday lotion.  I keep some in my purse, in the kitchen, at my desk, and in the bathroom.  My husband also likes it because it isn&#x27;t oily or greasy and doesn&#x27;t have a scent.</li>
    <li> My wives favorite.  This is a thick semi greasy lotion that absorbs/dries well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I however am allergic to some unknown chemical in it.  I have never been allergic to any other lotion. For some reason anytime I use this I break out in a rash around my eyes.</li>
    <li> Lotion is fine, but the pump doesn&#x27;t work well; sometimes not at all.</li>
    <li> Purchased this due to the really good reviews on here, glad I did.  The stuff is quite thick, though not greasy, we usually put it on after our bath/shower, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The best body lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. My skin type is extremely dry and this product has been the best solution.</li>
    <li> Stuff is way greasy! Works but is extremely Greasy!</li>
    <li> I love that this has been working well for my hands. Not greasy. Has a very light scent that doesn&#x27;t make me ill like some other perfumy fragrances.</li>
    <li> I have had severely dried and cracked fingers my entire life. To the point where they bleed out of nowhere and are excruciatingly painful, but after a couple weeks this did the trick and I don&#x27;t have to worry about that. I recommend this to anyone with severely dried skin.</li>
    <li> Hard to believe I had to order this online because I could not find it in stores. Good lotion but does not magically fix dry hands. Works about as good as any other</li>
    <li> totally love the lotion for a cold dry winter this is the only thing that helped my dry skin....! love it!</li>
    <li> I have tried several other products and this is by far the best.  You will notice a huge improvement in one day.</li>
    <li> we&#x27;ve tried dozens of types of hand lotion... as a group of nurses who wash their hands often this has proven by far the be the best solution to our cracked, dried hands.  Thanks Gold Bond for yet another great product</li>
    <li> I am not a huge lotion fan, but my skin dries out with changing weather conditions.  As far as lotion goes, this stuff is great.  Very mild scent, and lasts a long time without being greasy.  This is the only kind I will buy, and this is a great deal for how much you get.</li>
    <li> For me and my sensitive skin this is the best lotion I have used to date!  It is usually very pricey and I stock when there is a special. I was pleased to find it here on Amazon and at such a good price.</li>
    <li> I have really dry skin, so gold bond is always great.  I like this lotion, but it is definitely on the thicker side, I just mix it with a thinner one (like jergens) for easier application... works great.</li>
    <li> We are big fans of this product and jumped at the chance to purchase family size bottle. However, it was impossible to pump the product out of the bottle resulting in having to empty the contents into a jar and spoon it out as needed.  Most inconvenient!!!  Perhaps the content is too thick for the pumping mechanism provided.</li>
    <li> This particular Gold Bond lotion is used by our family at home and at the office; it works exceptionally well - just with the &amp;#34;feeder straw&amp;#34; were a little longer to get the last bits out; the lotion is so thick it is difficult to get the last bit out.</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth, fresh scent last all day. I can even feel it on the next morning I wake up. I&#x27;m from Houston but moved up north and its really dry out here, my skin was becoming harsh. This definitely did the trick</li>
    <li> I suffer from a bit of psoriasis, and I&#x27;ve found that the Gold Bond lotions work very well for me.  They&#x27;re very heavy - take a little effort to massage in - but they&#x27;re long lasting and quite soothing.  They&#x27;re also pretty much odorless and don&#x27;t seem to harm clothing, which I appreciate.</li>
    <li> Very thick. Not quite as effective as Gold Bond&#x27;s anti-itch lotion, but very nice for regular use. (Be sure to cut off the bottom inch of the bottle when the plunger stops working -- there is a lot of lotion left.)</li>
    <li> Like it but Gold Bond Diabetic Skin Relief Lotion is better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a type 2 diabetic and this cream works great for my feet and legs, it really softens the skin on the bottom of my feet.</li>
    <li> I used it a dry patch of skin and felt immediate difference. The patch is much softer.</li>
    <li> The lotion was so thick it wouldn&#x27;t pump out. Otherwise, it&#x27;s good lotion, but perhaps it should be packaged differently.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell you any more about how good this is without being redundant, but I can give you additional information that would have helped ME:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1) The scent is *not* &amp;#34;fresh, clean&amp;#34;; it&#x27;s definitely floral. But it&#x27;s so faint that it shouldn&#x27;t bother anyone except those allergic to scents of any kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2) If, like me, you expect a lotion to be runny - as in the normal definition of &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; - and you don&#x27;t like runny, then this is the cream for you. Someone complained, about the cream version, that it was so thick it didn&#x27;t completely absorb into their skin. Gold Bond&#x27;s &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; stays put where you apply it until you rub it in, just like a good cream should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(3) That &amp;$*(&amp; pump!! This is my second bottle of a Gold Bond product. I used about 1/3 of my first bottle before the pump just stopped working... I thought. Well, when I bought this bottle, brand new right out of the packaging, the pump didn&#x27;t work, so I knew there was some secret to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The secret is that it&#x27;s not good enough to just unscrew the pump to the &amp;#34;open&amp;#34; position. Even after you do that and the pump pops up, it *still* may not depress. In that case, you have to unscrew the base cap and pull the pump out enough to grab the clear base around the spring. If you grasp the base of the clear portion with your fingers, and then rotate the pump with your other hand, you will find that it clicks a little into place. I had to do that twice before my pump top would depress.</li>
    <li> I have very itchy legs when it gets a little cold outside and often wake up in the middle of the night scratching. I have found some relief with a prescription steroid cream but I don&#x27;t like using steroids. I have tried many different lotions and concluded that they were all the same (useless). And then I tried Gold Bond Healing. At first I used it 2-3 times a day and after the second day, no more itchy legs. After the 4th day, I only needed it every other day, thus the term &amp;#34;healing.&amp;#34; I couldn&#x27;t believe that this worked better than the prescription steroid cream. Note that when I first opened it, I needed to pump it about 10 times before anything came out.</li>
    <li> Smells great and not greasy. i use it on my daughter who has slight eczema on a small part of her back and after applying it on her body after baths, its gone!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!  Soothes and heals dry and cracked skin.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> This lotion feels so soothing to my skin. It also has a light but refreshing feel and cool scent. I&#x27;ve seen a difference in my skin&#x27;s texture. It definitely is way smoothing and clearer than before.</li>
    <li> This moisterizer made my dry legs and arms very smooth again. It really does heal.I recommend this to everyone !</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  But you only need to use a small amount compared to other lotions and it seems to survive even washing to some extent.</li>
    <li> So far this alongside vitamin c bar soap, has healed my dry skin, which has not only hydrated my skin, but prevented further acne.</li>
    <li> excellent moisturizing and healing qualities stays on all day, does not feel greasy light pleasant fragrance, highly recommend to all skin types to keep the ashiness away</li>
    <li> It dries in seconds, no greasy residue, pleasant smell, heals cracks of skin in a day or two, works even better for my family than Carmex.</li>
    <li> Does this stuff ever work!!  After using it extensively this &amp;#34;brutal&amp;#34; winter, I cant attest that it works when your hands dry out and begin to crack.  In just a few short days, skin is healing.  Non-greasy and pleasant smelling.  FANTASTIC.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion out there.  Very creamy out of the bottle and on the skin, not at all greasy.  Very soothing for dry, irritated skin.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years (after trying everything else out there) and still think it is super. The soothing, moisturizing effect lasts for hours.  I have several skin conditions &amp; most be very careful with what I use on my skin, so this lotion has been fabulous for me.  I hardly ever give 5 stars, but this lotion deserves it.</li>
    <li> Purchase this item 2 times and both times the pump did not work,  Will never buy this again I found it a waste of $$ since I have to take off the pump &amp; cap to use thiis.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. This lotion is not greasy like the other lotions available of the market today. The smell is mild enough to use a work and not overpowering. The container lasts a long time. With my sensitive skin, this is great and does not cause any irritations. Would recommend for anyone!</li>
    <li> We keep comimg back to this lotion.  It&#x27;s so thick and creamy that we use one squirt of this stuff where we used to use two squirts of the other brands we&#x27;ve tried.  And, best of all, it really works to cure my dry skin problem here in Arizona.</li>
    <li> I stumbled on this lotion accidentally when my hands dried out at work. There was a bottle on the table, so I went for it, and boy was I surprised! I&#x27;ve always hated lotions, particularly because my hands just wind up greasy and clammy. This is wonderful lotion. Suddenly at 25 I need lotion for itchy skin. This fixes it! The lotion is lightly scented, so light that you barely notice it. It is non-greasy. It also makes my skin feel amazing, and helped keep my from peeling after a sunburn!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it, and will be buying again!</li>
    <li> Everything was what I expected</li>
    <li> This seems to be a very good moisturizing lotion.  For someone with very dry skin, I appreciate anything I can use that obviates that.  I am enjoying this, but there are other lotions out there that satisfy me just as much.</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE this lotion. It really moisturizes your skin and doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy or smelly residue. My skin is really dry due to a thyroid issue. I can&#x27;t use any lotion with a lot of perfumes as it actually stings in the small cracks in my skin. This is the only lotion that I have found that I can put on without having to wash my palms. I constantly wash my hands and this seems to really last through my hand washing. Definitely non-greasing. I have bottles of this lotion in each room and in my car. Great lotion!</li>
    <li> I live in a very cold, dry, windy climate.  In the winter my hands really suffer.  I have sensitive skin and this works great for me.</li>
    <li> YES I LOVE  THESE THEY WORK QUICKLY I HAVE THEM ON  THE SUBSCRIBE &amp; SAVE PROGRAM TOO</li>
    <li> I have severely dry hands that are also sensitive to additives and this works fabulous, without irritation.</li>
    <li> I have really dry skin.  This helps a lot, until I find a miracle!</li>
    <li> The only lotion I use.  Makes my skin feel soft and my skin doesn&#x27;t itch when I use this lotion.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion I have come across for repairing dry, damaged skin. Gold Bond foot and/or hand cream is also wonderful and reasonably priced. This lotion is thick and perfect to use right before bedtime. You&#x27;ll wake up still feeling it&#x27;s effects.</li>
    <li> Always use this lotion in the winter as my hands crack easily and this lotion keeps my  hands in good shape!</li>
    <li> This is the only brand of lotion that I use, and it has to be the &amp;#34;healing&amp;#34; gold bond, not any of the other varieties.  I use it every day after I shower, and it&#x27;s fantastic, especially in the winter when my skin would be extra dry</li>
    <li> I read another review about how this cleared someone&#x27;s seborrhea so I bought it for my daughter, because her&#x27;s sometimes goes over her forehead and around her ears. Other medications for it are oily and smell horrible, so I thought why not! Well, my daughter is completely clear! She loves it and her skin is smooth. Lotion smells good and does not leave oily residue. She is so happy! Can&#x27;t recommend highly enough</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion we&#x27;ve found for dry skin in the winter time.  Highly recommend, super reasonable with subscribe and save.</li>
    <li> favorite lotion for everyday use. quick healing and great for night or day. was worried i wouldn&#x27;t like it in the summer bc i sweat a lot but it&#x27;s been great so far.</li>
    <li> Love the lotion, dislike that the pump was broken on this when I received it. So now i have to unscrew the lid and squeeze a blob out to use it :( not good</li>
    <li> This have distinguished itself against many competitors available to me, I live in an arctic environment and it seems like there are bottles moisturizers in every office and dorm and I would say this is the best of what I have used.</li>
    <li> Had an operation this winter and was laid up recovering in a warm house - lack of exercise and sitting around in the dry air really affected my skin.  This product made a huge difference - it seems to last instead of just sitting on the skin and washing right off.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for an all purpose healing lotion for serious skin dryness. This has helped very much. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite lotion. Good weight, not too greasy. NO SMELL!! I am very sensitive to smell and I use this on my face to I like that it does not smell. My whole family uses it.</li>
    <li> This product is too thick for the pump and it is impossible to get all the lotion out of the bottle!!  I worked for hours to empty it into 2 jars but I know there was some left in the bottle when I disposed of it.  Perhaps the solution would be to package in a jar instead of that costly useless bottle!  It&#x27;s a waste of money!</li>
    <li> This lotion is the best body lotion I&#x27;ve found so far for my extremely dry and sensitive skin. Like other reviewers said, the bottle is awful and leaves about 1/5 of the product left at the bottom. I&#x27;ve tried cutting the bottle open (so difficult!!) and tried microwaving like other reviewers suggested. This works perfectly, just be careful the bottle gets hot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s still worth it, despite the packaging. I haven&#x27;t found another lotion (that is this affordable) that does the job.</li>
    <li> MY SKIN IS FEELING AND LOOKING SO MUCH BETTER.  THANKS GOLD BOND.</li>
    <li> Before i got this lotion to review I had previously seen it in a magazine. I tried it out and i love this lotion. It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, it absorbs quick, and it moisturizes your skin very well. I would recommend this product. It even helps if you get a sunburn to stop the peeling. This is the only lotion i will use now. It also smells really good but not to overpowering. I prefer the squeeze bottle of this lotion over the big one with the pump though. I realized every time about a quarter of that lotion gets wasted in those big bottles because the pump doesn&#x27;t work when it gets that low, and the bottle is so big you can&#x27;t get the rest of the lotion out. It is a little pricey but really worth what it cost. I was given this product for free in return for a honest review. The review is honest and 100% my own opinion.</li>
    <li> Best lotion I have found, and I&#x27;ve tried them all.  Not greasy, really, really thick - more like a cream, and I still feel moisturized at the end of the day. I have very dry skin.</li>
    <li> Very thick and nice smelling.</li>
    <li> this is one cream that never changed after I started to use. Great product</li>
    <li> Perfect, Exactly as Described.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent cream.  I have eczema and it relieves the dryness very well.  I use along with CeraVe.</li>
    <li> You are worth it too!  Treat your body to the protection it needs from the drying winter weather.  One of the best things about this wonderful lotion is that it is non-greasy.  I bought three to have in the three locations where I find myself in my home.</li>
    <li> After trying what seems like every hand lotion on the planet, I found Gold Bond a few years ago.  Unfortunately it&#x27;s also fairly expensive so I&#x27;m always looking for sales.  When I stumbled on this deal on Amazon I was thrilled since not only is the price good, but the bottle is huge.  I find Gold Bond to be the perfect amount of moisture without being sticky, while still being rich and thick.</li>
    <li> This is the greatest skin product.  I use it on my back which gets itchy in the winter time and it relieved it right away.  It is also great for hands and like they say you can feel it working even after you wash your hands.</li>
    <li> Feels good and definitely not &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; when put on. Like oily per se. Idk how to explain it but I recommend. Smells all right.</li>
    <li> This lotion is over the top fabulas!  I have used it for over a year and I will buy nothing else.  I use it on my face too.  It feels great!!!</li>
    <li> If you are suffering from extremely dry skin and I mean ultra-extremely dry skin, Gold Bond&#x27;s lotion is the solution. Ultimate healing is a fitting name for this excellent product. I wash my hands...a lot and as you can imagine they can get painfully chapped; whenever I have a bottle of this on hand, like now, my hands are completely fine. The product itself is excellent, really excellent, however the pump is a liability; as in, the pumps seem to have an inordinately high defect rate.</li>
    <li> Only thing that works on my dry skin.</li>
    <li> My husband stole my purse-sized container of this lotion, and asked if I could order more.  Here&#x27;s the review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, I love that it&#x27;s available in a pump size.  All lotion in the world should come with a pump.  It just makes sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gold Bond itself is an incredible product.  I love their powder, and the lotion does not disappoint.  This has a great, silky feel and leaves skin smooth.  The pleasant scent is not too strong or overpowering.  Perfect for man or woman or anything in between.  Gentle enough to use on face (yes, my husband does this) or kids.  Not oily or greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving this an A+.  My husband&#x27;s skin feels great, but you&#x27;ll have to take my word for it.  It&#x27;s a great product, a great size, and a totally worth it great price.</li>
    <li> This lotion works great on my elbows and ankles where 50+ years of use has rendered them dry and hard.  I am a man and like the fact that this lotion is relatively sent free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only negative is it is almost impossible to get the last bit (5%?) of lotion out of the bottle as the tube that pumps the lotion up does not go all the way into one corner but just floats in the middle.  Not a deal breaker but if you hate wasting it may drive you crazy. :)</li>
    <li> I first tried the smaller tube size and liked it well enough to get the larger economy size.  I expect to buy it again.</li>
    <li> Great quality lotion, the moisture lasts much longer than other brands I have tried. I like it because it is sort of thick like cocoa butter but easier to spread/ apply.</li>
    <li> My skin is a good test bed for lotions and creams. Given I have bad skin, I&#x27;ve tried half a billion lotions and creams over the past decade. And Gold Bond Ultimate is definitely one of the finest I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had to describe this in a [long] sentence, it would be, &amp;#34;an every-day medium-weight moisturizer that is easy to rub in, wears lightly without that &#x27;heavy feeling&#x27;, does not clog pores, does not irritate acne, and is capable of moisturizing even very dry skin, but without being greasy.&amp;#34; And I would also have to add that, &amp;#34;it is an excellent product for post-shaving treatment, including for usage with mixing with an aftershave, as it helps right razor burn and is not irritating to freshly-shaven areas.&amp;#34; So please forgive my sentence for running on...it&#x27;s just I have a lot of positive things to say!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gold Bond has a reputation for making very good products, but some which are rather greasy. This lotion follows that tradition of great performance, and yet it does a fantastic job at not being greasy and not leaving that weird &amp;#34;residue&amp;#34; feeling that some moisturizers can leave. Put this on and a few minutes you&#x27;ve done forgotten about it (likewise you&#x27;ve done forgotten about dry skin as this stuff knocks it out.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both my personal usage, and all of the great reviews here are good indicators that this is one of those &amp;#34;do-all&amp;#34; lotions. That is, whether you have eczema, healing sunburn, dry skin, light friction burns, cracks/abrasions from drying, or one of the many conditions that can cause bumps/abrasions/marks/changes in skin, it can handle it and it works well on many different types of skins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing these reviews show is that this is a great lotion at avoiding irritation, and that applies to many different skins given skin (and people) are different. Some lotions contain various ingredients that can make some skin very ticked off. Unfortunately, I am one of those people. Ten minutes after a lotion with one or more of these (many) ingredients and you&#x27;d think I am the red counterpart of the Blue Man Group. Not an issue here. So for those with sensitivities, this is a good candidate to try to see how it works. I dare say you will most likely be pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The way people use lotions differ depending on their needs. I personally use this as a &amp;#34;day&amp;#34; lotion, and it&#x27;s one of my top preferences for this role. After showering and as a night version, I use Vanicream&#x27;s original Cream. It is a fantastic cream, but as the name implies, it&#x27;s a heavyweight cream. VaniCream at night and this Gold Bond in the morning and I have a heavier weight cream for repair at night and a lighter-weight lotion for day that still delivers excellent moisturizing. I personally do not like the feeling heavier creams leave during the day and so this method for me works great (and I recommend it to anyone looking for some quality skin care for around-the-clock effectiveness!) If you do not like that &#x27;icky&#x27; feeling heavier weight moisturizers can leave, you will be very impressed by how well this works despite how lightly it wears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downsides to this are 1) the container, and 2) the price. The container I will gripe about because (like most every other pump) the pump does not get all, or even close to all of the lotion (I generally save &#x27;empty&#x27; bottles, and after I get 4 or 5 empties I cut them open, scoop out what is left, and generally have half an entire bottle from my recovery expedition). The other is price, but it&#x27;s worth noting that almost all of the good lotions are going to have a premium, plus you do get a lot of lotion here (20 ounces) for the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall, this is a great lotion. As these many great reviews show, this lotion delivers some serious repair power to skin, but without greasiness and without using ingredients that commonly cause irritation to those with sensitive skin. In other words, AWESOME STUFF!utes after a lotion with one or more of these (many) ingredients and you&#x27;d think I am the red counterpart of the Blue Man Group. Not an issue here.

    <li> BEST lotion for the winter!</li>
    <li> This lotion is a bit thicker than I expected but it easily applies, has a nice fragrance and softens my skin</li>
    <li> This is really the best lotion and the family size is a great bargain.  This is very good for any kind of sensitive skin.  And if your skin isn&#x27;t sensitive it&#x27;s perfect for that too.</li>
    <li> If you have dry skin, you may wish to try this Gold Bond skin lotion.  I walk a lot and my feet get dry.  And we have a wood burning stove which dries the air.  I tried the Gold Bond cream for my feet and liked it.  It didn&#x27;t sting as some other lotions with more scent in them do.  Decided to get a large container like this 20 oz. one to keep around the house to use on my feet and skin.  It works fantastic, never stings, has a pleasant scent, is nice and thick and stays on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It adds a protective layer of moisture.  It is hypoallergenic.  It has worked for me. I apply it to my feet when I go out to walk, get on the treadmill or return from walking. Or it&#x27;s great to put on just before bedtime.</li>
    <li> It is the best I&#x27;ve ever tried. I really don&#x27;t know what more I can say. Dry skin is gone !!!</li>
    <li> Product works great for me.  Gold Bond needs a better pump assy and they could use a clear bottle so you can see when you are getting low.</li>
    <li> I suffer on occasion from Monkey Butt. As far as I can figure out, &amp; from what my dermatologist has told me about Monkey Butt, it is not a hygiene issue: Monkey Butt appears to be caused from either using too much laundry detergent on your underwear, or not using a long enough rinse cycle in addition to being exposed to really high temperature &amp; humidity. The perfect place for Monkey Butt to proliferate, therefore, is the asscrack. What happens is- your buttcrack gets chafed &amp; it spreads from there until your entire ass gets red as a monkey&#x27;s ass. For that, you need to get you a rag on a stick dipped in turpentine for a selfie, OR go to a doctor and pay $200 for some annie bitopical ointment. Gold Bond do not work on it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I have very sensitive skin and allergies.  I was breaking out in itchy rashes prior to using this however since I started using this product, several years ago, no more itchy rashes from other products!!</li>
    <li> I occasionally get these random dry spots on my body - normally my legs. I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of lotions, creams, etc to relieve them but nothing works - except this! Great product for extremely dry skin. Has a very thick texture.</li>
    <li> The two stars are for the product, which I like.  But as others have said, a lot of thick lotion collects in the bottom and lacking bolt cutters, it is impossible for me to open the bottle to recover it the way I have to do with your foot cream, which has similar bad packaging.  Either you have terrible engineering in your company or are crassly trying to increase turnover and sell more product.  Either choice doesn&#x27;t reflect well on you.  So I&#x27;m done.  Gold Bond anything is not worth buying as long as it is packaged in this disrespectful, avaricious way.</li>
    <li> I will buy this again. it is so soothing</li>
    <li> GREAT QUALITY - GREAT PRICE - HUSBAND LOVES HIS GOLD BOND TOO !  A+</li>
    <li> I think most of gold bond products are overrated and over advertised. None of it works as it is advertised for me.</li>
    <li> I have eczema that&#x27;s aggravated by cold temperatures outside, heater on inside, dry weather, etc.  I haven&#x27;t had a problem with it since I started using this lotion 2 years ago.  2 whole years of no skin issues.  And it has a nice smell.</li>
    <li> This stuff is thick and and lasts all day. It comes out in almost a solid product. You can tell that they add very little to no water to this lotion. You can squirt it on your hand, turn your hand upside down, and it won&#x27;t fall off your hand. It also does not leave your skin oily or greasy. This is a fantastic quality product, and I am a lifelong user!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  It makes your skin feel so smooth and it absorbs quickly so there is no residue.  If you have extremely dry skin then this is the lotion for you.</li>
    <li> Good lotion if you can get it out of the bottle.</li>
    <li> product was as advertised fast delivery</li>
    <li> softening and very pleased</li>
    <li> good lotion ,not greasy , decent scent. the bottle is so full of air though that it takes at least 4-6 pumps to get a little out everytime</li>
    <li> love the smell  non greasy  order every month</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion.  It is heavy but I like the feel of my hands after using it.  You only need a little so one bottle goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This is the first lotion that I&#x27;ve used that keeps my dry hands and cuticles moist.  In my line of work, I wash my hands probably 20 times (or more) a day.</li>
    <li> I have REALLY bad skin (eczema). Most lotions do not work that great for me, and I always use the same kind. I purchased this because of the great reviews. I must say, it does work pretty well and makes my skin feel relief after applying. The only thing that bothers me is it is kind of heavily scented. So I don&#x27;t use it that often because it works up my allergies. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a really good lotion. If they made an unscented version, I would definitely use this more.</li>
    <li> good and does what it advertised</li>
    <li> Lotion is great, but the pump doesn&#x27;t work. I tried running hot water through it, thinking the lotion had dried/congealed, but even this didn&#x27;t work. Defective pump seems to be a common problem described in the reviews.</li>
    <li> Gold Bond is the BEST!! no other lotion comes close.</li>
    <li> Soaks in and heals.  Not greasy!</li>
    <li> really works well at treating rough chapped winter skin.  I&#x27;ve always used fragrance free before but this scent was very light and hardly noticeable.  I will use this product again.</li>
    <li> Much less expensive than my old $44 stuff to handle my rough heals and works as well or better.  My new sheet purchases should go down.</li>
    <li> husband uses it also. we have had a COLD winter here and it only makes good sense to try and protect your bare skin and he has to be outside a lot. i will recommend to a large group of trivia players who complain about itchy winter dry skin-cost i consider to be reasonable too.</li>
    <li> And I have tried all kinds. I live in Denver where hand lotion is a must every time you wash your hands. This goes on nicely and stays on without making your hands greasy.</li>
    <li> The only lotion for me!  Thicker than Curel.  Good stuff!</li>
    <li> Best lotion ever and nongreasy!  Priced better than a drugstore.</li>
    <li> Best overall lotion I found. Used once a day keeps hands and arms soft.</li>
    <li> thick but not greasy.  absorbs well. leave skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> Best lotion for dry skin</li>
    <li> Works great, and has a pleasing fragrance.  Also absorbs into your skin quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel on your skin.</li>
    <li> See my review for Gold BondCoQ10 lotion!  They are ALL GREAT LOTIONS!</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion.  It is a heavier, richer lotion and I feel like it is much better for my dry skin than the thinner lotions.  I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> Great lotion. You could call me a lotion addict, I give this two thumbs up.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t like scent as much but its great for your skin.</li>
    <li> My daughters favorite</li>
    <li> Now that I need to ware compression hose for my lower legs. The gold bond ultimate healing lotion works great at keeping my legs moisturized in the evening. Great for the skin with a lite scent. Works for me. Also great for your hands at night.</li>
    <li> I accidentally bought this thinking it was the regular intensive healing hand cream. While it does moisturize well it has a lot of pitfalls. First, the smell isn&#x27;t the best although it is tolerable. It is also very greasy. I work in a medical setting and whenever I touch my rolling stool it leaves a greasy hand print which is awkward and hard to get off the leather. I also dislike that it doesn&#x27;t absorb as well...it leaves little chunks of waxy stuff behind that rub off onto my clothes leaving an unsightly white film. All in all it accomplishes its purposes as a moisturizer but I would only suggest it for night time use.</li>
    <li> Cleared up my bad dry skin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s keeping my skin hydrated!</li>
    <li> I totally love this lotion. Not only does it help heal the scuffs and flakes on my skin, it works to heal sunburn and insect bites. I love this lotion! I even use it on my face, and I have extremely sensitive skin. Works for me!</li>
    <li> This is really great lotion; however, it should be sold in either a tub or a tube because it is more of a cream.  The pump is inadequate for the consistency of the product.  Once you know this, you can immediately transfer into a different vessel, but the first time it catches you unaware.  I have bought this in both stores and at Amazon because I really like it, but the pump quality has always been the same.</li>
    <li> Gold Bond is a nice moisturizing lotion without SPF.  It seems to be super thick coming out of the pump.  My other bottle of Gold Bond lotion with SPF is very creamy and spreads easily.  I don&#x27;t know if this is supposed to be thick and harder to spread on the skin, or if I got a bad bottle.  It&#x27;s moisturizing though and that&#x27;s why I purchased it.</li>
    <li> there is no better lotion on the market, PERIOD. ive tried them all. just look at the ingredients.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend has incredibly dry hands all the time from constantly having to be around water. This lotion is the only lotion he will use. Doesn&#x27;t leave the greasy feeling and doesn&#x27;t have a strong fragrance other than just that &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; smell.</li>
    <li> This is pretty good.  It softened up the dry skin on my hands/forearms right away.  Its a big bottle too so that&#x27;s good since I use it about 2-3x per day.  Only issue is there is a strong fragrance that some might not like and it doesn&#x27;t absorb immediately but still quicker then average.  I think if the diabetic version was larger and cheaper I&#x27;d prefer that instead (no scent/fast absorbing) but this works too</li>
    <li> Winter is terrible for me. I don&#x27;t do well in the cold, so a hot shower + cold morning air &#x3D; terrible flaky dry skin. This Gold Bond lotion soaks in well and has eliminated all my problems. My skin is smooth and flexible, even outdoors. I use it on my face, arms, and entire upper body My last bottle was a 14.5oz, which I haven&#x27;t finished yet, and it lasted me all last winter, and will easily last me all of this one. (12/14/2013 now). This being a 20oz, should last me until 2016. $10 for 3 years of relief is a small price to pay for sure.</li>
    <li> My doctor recommended vaseline for a treatment for my dry, cracked feet.  Well, that lasted one day.  I love Gold Bond, and saw this Gold Bond Ultimate Healing Skin Therapy Lotion, so gave it a try.  It&#x27;s a perfect medium between hand/body lotion my doctor&#x27;s awful remedy.  It goes on thick, soaks in quickly but leaves a light layers on top of the skin.  This is great, because I wash my house slippers once a week, and any of this wonderful lotion that comes off stays in my slippers.  My feet are always in contact with the cream.  I use it nightly after my bath/shower to seal in the moisture, then on goes the slippers.  It worked!  My parched, cracked skin is now pink and healthy.  It took about a month to really show, then they really continued to improved quickly after that.  I am diabetic and have to take great care with my feet.  I HIGHLY recommend this product to anybody with troublesome feet and those with beautiful, healthy skin as well.</li>
    <li> I did not buy this from Amazon but I rarely have a product work as well as this one so I had to review.  I have had eczema most of my life and this is literally the only lotion (including the prescriptions from my dermatologist) that has kept the eczema completely away, which NEVER happens, especially during the winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To top it off, I can put this lotion on in the morning (I use it all over my body) and wake up the next day still feeling the lotion on my skin.  My skin is incredibly moist and soft, the lotion is thick and creamy and blends right in.  For the first time in my life at 30 years old, I have gone dry skin free through the entire winter.  I will not use anything else but this lotion, you must try to see for yourself!</li>
    <li> I use lotion on a regular basis and this is the best long lasting and thick, I&#x27;m out . think I&#x27;ll order more after this review</li>
    <li> I use this product all the time - in my opinion it&#x27;s the best hand cream on the market!&lt;br /&gt;Great value for money.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lotion.  Yes, it feels a bit greasy and it is thick.  It is light on fragrance and feels good on my skin after application.  The lotioned skin will feel a bit sticky to the touch afterwards, but I don&#x27;t find it to be an issue.  It is my go-to body lotion and I turned my wife on to it and she likes it too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had not had issues with the family size container until the last two I received on subscription.  I had to pump for several minutes to get it going the first time I came across this issue.  Yesterday though, repeated pumps seemed futile.  Today, I came across the following helpful video on youtube:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;7NK-d66Vu30&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the instructions and was able to resolve the issue.  Using a small tub filled with warm water (closer to hot than luke warm), I drowned the whole dispenser piece and started pumping until water was coming out.  During this process, you should see the lotion move up the tube and into the dispensing area.  Some lotion may be salvaged by anticipating when it comes out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once the water started coming out, I took the dispencer piece out of the water and pumped it till almost all of it was gone.  Just some drops left.  I replaced the dispencer back into the bottle and pumped and was disappointed it didn&#x27;t work after a few pumps.  I took the dispencer back out and saw some lotion was in the tube.  I started pumping and could see the lotion move up the tube.  I pumped and emptied the remaining lotion.  I placed the dispencer back in again and this time after a few pumps, it worked!</li>
    <li> works beautifully,  I work outside, constantly washing hands with terrible cheap soap which dries and cracks my hands,  This feels soooooo good,  just like therapy for real.  love it</li>
    <li> Great lotion at an outstanding value.  I prefer it over any and all lotions I have used in the past, and that includes a great many names of both popular and &amp;#34;healing&amp;#34; varieties.  It is not unscented, but has a subtle and pleasing aroma, is thicker than many lotions but seems to be absorbed more effectively by the skin.  I have used everything from home-remedy to high-end boutique products and find this suits me better than any of them.  I highly recommend this Gold Bond Healing Skin Therapy Lotion for both general purpose and problem skin areas.</li>
    <li> Great lotion, can&#x27;t find Family size in stores</li>
    <li> Coming from warm climate and settling in cold climate, my skin has become more sensitive and very dry. Gold Bond really helps my skin in winter!! It&#x27;s not greasy but you will feel that you have applied the cream. I would definitely recommend to every one who is struggling with Dry Skin!</li>
    <li> This is the best, most effective lotion I have ever used. I don&#x27;t like using products like Aveeno because they tend to be greasy and too thinly spread. This lotion is thick but quickly sinks into the skin so that I can put it on my hands at a red light and be able to use the steering wheel after the light changes to green. I love it! The only problem with this brand is that a few times I have gotten faulty or easily broken pumps.</li>
    <li> This stuff works well, but when you put it on you feel all wet and waxy and greasy. It doesn&#x27;t absorb fast at all. But it works, so that&#x27;s good :)</li>
    <li> For years now, this is my favorite hand and body lotion, after spending years going through every brand, cheap and fancy alike. This package is a great value. The only thing that always and issue with these pump packages is, that you still have plenty left in the bottle and the pump just don&#x27;t reach it anymore so you have to cut it open and put it in a different container.</li>
    <li> First time trying this brand for lotion. Works great but is a little greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin in the Winter, and this product is a life-saver.  I keep one at the office, and one at home throughout the dry Winter months.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what they were thinking when they put men&#x27;s fragrance in this!  It&#x27;s the same lotion we&#x27;ve had for years, but it smells like a man.  UGH.</li>
    <li> it is great.It actually works very well on my husband&#x27;s very dry skin. We are definitely buying it again this winter</li>
    <li> I hate greasy lotion, but this is not greasy at all. I don&#x27;t use lotion often, but during the winter, my hands dry out sometimes, and this stuff works great!</li>
    <li> This is the best value I&#x27;ve seen in a product I have loved for years.  There is nothing better for winter skin.</li>
    <li> I usually do not use lotions because they make my skin feel greasy.  The Gold Bond moisturizes the skin without leaving a residue.  I will certainly purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Great product love the bigger size my wife uses it like crazy.</li>
    <li> I like the lotion. But the pump on the container does not work properly.  This is the second bottle I have had and both pumps were not working.  It makes it difficult to use as squeezing the bottle to get the product is not all that easy.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for dry heals.  Only problem was initially getting pump to work since lotion was clotted in the pump.  Had to remove pump and pump hot water through it.  Now works perfectly.</li>
    <li> good location, do not know about healing qualities.</li>
    <li> Gold Bond is the best winter lotion.  It is much thicker than most other lotions, but doesn&#x27;t smell bad like Eucerin.  Plus, it is creamy and not oily, so sinks into your skin instead of making you sticky.  This is my go to lotion from Oct to April.  In the summer I use Aveeno, which is lighter.  This is a great price for this size as well.</li>
    <li> I started using Gold Bond after my nephew&#x27;s recommendation. He works as an officer frequently out doors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has been the best lotion I have ever tried. My skin is extremly dry up to a point that feels burning and cracks. After I started on Gold Bond, bye bye dryness. Of course, it is not a one time application. If I use it at least once a day, my skin will not crack.</li>
    <li> Loved this lotion! It is what I&#x27;ve been looking for and finally found it. Have purchase other Gold Bond lotions but this is the best.  I like it because it&#x27;s not watery and  is thicker than the other Gold Bond  lotions.</li>
    <li> The best lotion I have used and believe me I had tried a bunch.  I have very dry skin and this helped my skin feel softer as soon as I applied it.  I can&#x27;t wait to try some of the other Gold Bond products.</li>
    <li> Good stuff for dry skin!  I live in FL and I am outside almost everyday in the sun.  My skin needs all the help it can get for moisture and this lotion definitely helps my skin with moisture.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I love the smell, it&#x27;s a clean, non-overwhelming scent that doesn&#x27;t clash with whatever perfume you may be wearing. Absorbs quickly, thicker than regular lotion, comparing to St. Yves, and leaves hands feeling moist but not greasy; mom used to rub Vaseline (petroleum jelly) on me growing up, so I run from moisturizers with same texture and consistency.</li>
    <li> Our favorite everyday lotion, easy to put on and not sticky or gooey.  Doesn&#x27;t leave hands feeling goopy and works to prtoect skin for this warehouse shipper who is constantly handling paper and boxes with frequent hand-washing.</li>
    <li> good stuff good price.</li>
    <li> Great for swimmers in chlorine all the time...</li>
    <li> HAD PUT UP WITH MUCH ITCHING,ALL OVER MY BODY,AND IT SURE WAS ANNOYING.THRIED OTHER THINGS, INCLUDING BODY LOTION,WITH NO HELP,,GOLD BOND LOTION CAME TO THE RESCUE...NO MORE ITCHING ! I LOVE IT AND WILL REORDER ..........&lt;br /&gt;WITH MY GOOD OLD PRIME .  MR. BROWN</li>
    <li> This lotion really helped my dry skin stay soft and hydrated for a full day.  It&#x27;s non-scented, rich and absorbs quickly leaving your skin feeling soft. This is my new favorite body moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Pump dispenser did not work, not worth returning because shipping cost more than the product so I have to dump it my hand by unscrewing the top huge waste</li>
    <li> This is great for men and women.  You can use it on your face and entire body.  Not greasy and no smell.</li>
    <li> I got this in a smaller bottle at CVS for the same price, so it was a NO brain-er to get it from this site. I love how it works on my feet and knees. It is a good product for me.</li>
    <li> As a nurse I wash my hands constantly and I have yet to find a lotion better than this one.  I still get dry hands from time to time but this is the one to beat.  It is thick, soothing, moisturizing, non greasy, and non scented.</li>
    <li> Great stuff I live in the desert so need a high quality lotion for dry skin and this fits the bill</li>
    <li> my go to lotion. its rich and thick works very well i have dry skin year round and when i go pick this up it makes a huge difference. my thirsty skin usually will absorb a lotion and wham within an hr i look ashy again not with this lotion it lasts several hrs. my son has eczema and it works well on the go as well when he forgets to put his aquifer on.</li>
    <li> Pump fell apart apart upon opening!  Product is OK but dispenser is junk!  Tried transferring into another disp, but didn&#x27;t work either.</li>
    <li> I started using this and fully agree with the highest reviews but was dissatisfied with the waste when it congealed and became too hard to pump or even pour when low. I propopsed to transfer he contents to a plastic kitchen container and use as a cream but being paralyzed cannot do so myself and my caregiver found it too much trouble, so I switched to the lotion in tubes, which is not the same as this although it is almost as effective. I would return to this product in an instant if it came in a more accessible container like a tube, or as a cream in a jar.</li>
    <li> Good stuff,  I use it regularly.</li>
    <li> Love how soft this makes my skin without the greasy feel. Also stays moisturized for a full day. I especially need this because I frequently swim and have dry skin from the pool, but this definitely helps!</li>
    <li> My husband has never commented on how soft my skin was until I started using this. I used to buy all sorts of expensive perfume-y lotions but he likes this the best!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t want to sound like a bad ad, but this lotion really does leave my hands soft and supple. Great if you want other people to think that other people do &amp;#34;outside work&amp;#34; for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I used Gold Bond, my hands would be a cracked and bloody mess every winter. The upside was that no one would want to shake my hand, which probably reduced disease transmission. But no more! My hands are in such good shape that I don&#x27;t even want to use them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And this has a pretty good odor too. Your spouse will never say something like &amp;#34;Are you stinking up the car by putting that s**t on your hands again?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a few bottles so I can have on in every room AND in the car. Really, if I could drink this stuff, I would.</li>
    <li> Growing up, I was never taught by my parents to moisturize my skin, so I generally had very dry and sometimes cracked hands &amp; feet, and when winter came around, my face &amp; ears took a beating too!  My wife tried for years to get me to use different lotions, but I hated how greasy I&#x27;d feel both putting it on and hours after.  This stuff very initially feels greasy, but upon rubbing it in, the feeling goes away quickly and you can go all day without feeling like you&#x27;ve got a set of greasy gloves &amp; socks on your hands &amp; feet.  I also never go without putting it on my face either (whether summer or winter).  I highly recommend this stuff to anyone - it&#x27;s completely transformed my skin without being an annoyance!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lotion. Nuff said?</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry skin (I often say my skin feels like it&#x27;s 2 sizes too small), and get these bumpy red patches on the back of my calves and arms that itch like crazy.  Have tried just about every cream and lotion out there, otc and prescription. Tried this based on a few reviews with a &amp;#34;what do I have to lose&amp;#34; attitude, and was amazed.  I immediately felt relief from the itching - I think it was the first night in a long time I didn&#x27;t wake up scratching my legs. Within a few days the skin was smooth, the itch completely gone.  I can&#x27;t believe I have been suffering all these years.  I have both versions, one is unscented and one is very lightly scented. The light scent is very pleasant, not overpowering, and goes well with any fragrance I choose to wear.  I used the unscented the first month because I didn&#x27;t want to irritate my skin, and I&#x27;m allergic to just about everything under the sun!! I have my next doctor&#x27;s appt soon and I can&#x27;t wait to show him the improvement and tell him how I did it!!</li>
    <li> This is the best we have ever found</li>
    <li> I really appreciate the relief I get from Gold Bond lotion. I suffer from dry skin and really depend on Gold Bond for help.</li>
    <li> Works for my sensitive skin over the long cold winter! I wish they made hair products too for the New England winters</li>
    <li> This is the best product of it&#x27;s kind on the market, smooth, not greasy, no stinkum, just a perfect solution for the winter itchies.</li>
    <li> Anything Gold Bond makes is quality, and this lotion is no exception.  The best for hands, face, feet....you name it.  If I had one complaint with this size when I bought them previously on Amazon the pumps were crap and broke almost right away.  I had to go out and buy a pump for this size jar to keep on hand, but this last shipment seems to have fixed that problem</li>
    <li> does not feel greasy, soaks in quickly</li>
    <li> It works, but it WILL leave your skin feeling greasy despite the &#x27;non-greasy&#x27; claim.</li>
    <li> This one is a good lotion for winter. The smell of aloe is mild, refreshing, and long-lasting, and your skin feels great for a long time after you have put on this lotion. I recommend trying this out to see if it works for you.</li>
    <li> l LIKE THE LOTION, BUT THE PUMP DOES&amp;#34;NT WORK AND LOTION WASN&#x27;T FILLED TO THE TOP.</li>
    <li> I purchased this lotion about a year ago and I have been looking for it since.  It is the best skin lotion that I found.  I use it every day at night or after the gym and I can see a big improvement with my skin</li>
    <li> Winter skin -- arghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh This works and puts a stop to it quickly! Not greasy, pleasant scent, fast acting -- what more can you ask for??</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like to write negative review since in this case the actual product, the healing lotion, has worked well during the seven days i have used it. It does what it says it will. The bottle arrived along with two other items in a  box from Amazon. The lotion was packaged in a plastic bag, I assume to keep the contents from spilling into the box. The lotion however did spill into the plastic bag but not on the other items. Not a big deal. However sending back to Amazon would have been expensive and I chose not to do that. Instead I thought a courtesy note to the manufacture telling them about the broken pump and asking for a replacement pump(only). What ticks me off is that the company would not even answer the mails and they certainly did not send me a replacement. Now I have a broken down bottle that I must try to pour what is a very thick lotion onto my hand to use. I even tried to transfer the lotion to another bottle and due to the thickness the lotion will not flow that well. Looks like I am going to have to cut the bottle in half and then dip into the contents when I need some. The lotion is five star. The service from the mfg. is \\&quot;one star\\&quot;. A closer inspection of the pump shows that the top portion of the pump is broken around the screw cap with the plastic being extremely thin.This is definitely a manufacturing issue.I would suggest that you think twice about ordering this product through the mail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received letter today (3/15/2014) from company which said if I would mail bottle back to them they would send me a coupon. The letter contained a mailing label from company.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for years now. I started because I love to garden and my hands take a real beating in the summer time. I used to get a lot of cracks in my knuckles and on the tips of my fingers because of winter dryness, too. But I don&#x27;t get them anymore and I have moved to a drier climate as well.&lt;br /&gt;I even use this lotion on my face, morning and night, as does my husband. I do have good genes, but I think this helps to keep me looking younger (and it doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg.)&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other formulations of gold bond, which I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with, such as the COQ10, but this one is the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried!</li>
    <li> Nice lotion. I have others that work as well and cost much less. I am one of those people that must lather on the lotion after my daily shower so I need a good product that is also affordable.</li>
    <li> I have mild eczema on my arms, and I find this stuff works as well as, if not better than, some of the steroidal creams that I have been prescribed in the past to mitigate the flare ups. I would love to give the product 5 stars, but unfortunately the dispenser that the cream comes in is awful. Out of the 4 times I have ordered one of these bottles, twice the pump on the top the bottle was broken, requiring that I unscrew the lid every time I want to use it. I don&#x27;t know if this is due to damage in shipping or defective bottle design (my guess is that the cream is so thick that a standard pump isn&#x27;t really enough) but it&#x27;s really annoying!</li>
    <li> It smells very clean and the formula is thick. I expected so much more from goldbond especially since I have had good experiences with their products in the past. I was disappointed to see that it did not make any difference.</li>
    <li> i have super dry skin, this lotion saves my arms and legs from eternal dryness, i apply right after i shower, and boom, lovely soft skin!</li>
    <li> I love this type and brand of lotion.  Works the best of ALL I&#x27;ve tried</li>
    <li> I first tried Gold Bond&#x27;s Ultimate Healing Skin Therapy Lotion in a trial size, and I was impressed, so I ordered the 20 oz. size from Amazon. It has a light, pleasant fragrance. I&#x27;m not a fan of watery lotions, so I love that this one is thick--and yet it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. I mostly use it on my always-dry hands and on my cuticles to keep them from cracking, but it&#x27;s a great body lotion as well.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!  It helps keep my very dry skin moisturized.  The fragrance is very light and I am not allergic to it.  The fact that it is not smelly and that it actually works is wonderful.  I have been buying the smaller size for quite some time now.  This larger pump looks like an excellent deal money-wise... as long as it pumps all the way to the bottom.  If it does not, I will come back and change my review but for now, I love it!</li>
    <li> I always run out of things like lotion so I decided to try subscribe and save through Amazon. This lotion is great. Some of the lotion wont come out at the bottom. Have to take the lid off and bang it out. Other than that, no complaints</li>
    <li> For me this lotion works the best at moisturizing my skin all day long. Helps to keep dry scaly or flaky skin at bay. I use it every morning. I would recommend this product for those who battle dry skin. I have been using it for over 2 years.</li>
    <li> I am very finicky about my lotion...this is the only lotion that I will consistently buy. Super thick and moisturizing.</li>
    <li> This helps my husband&#x27;s cracked feet as well as the only other cream that workes, Crabtree &amp; Evelyn Gardeners Hand Therapy, which is $18 per 3.4 oz tube. We&#x27;re saving a ton of money using the Gold Bond!</li>
    <li> It it the only lotion I use now. My sister is an RN, and she first recommended it. It absorbs easily without leaving a residue and doesn&#x27;t wash away. I only have to put it on once a day, and I&#x27;m all set for all day hydration.</li>
    <li> Gold Bond Ultimate Healing Skin Therapy Lotion does what it says it will! No false advertising here! It makes your skin feel soft as velvet. I would recommend it highly!</li>
    <li> It would be nice if the squirt thingy worked. Instead, I snort the cream with a straw to get it out of the bottle.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff. It&#x27;s the only lotion I use now. It just does wonders for your skin and this is a much better deal than you&#x27;ll find in the store. I HIGHLY recommend. For any skin type but best for the dryer skin.</li>
    <li> could not use either of two I bought, pump on one was broken on arrival the second broke on first use. I use and love other Gold Bond products, but, I&#x27;d never buy this again. Doesn&#x27;t deserve the one star.</li>
    <li> Great product, works well.  However you really have to work to get any lotion out when the bottle is about half full.  You have to run it under hot water and try banging it on the counter.  This usually damages the pump. I finally solved the problem by transferring the lotion to a bottle with a heavy duty pump. The bottle that I use is  also clear so I know when to add more lotion.  Otherwise great product.</li>
    <li> I love gold bond products. They work as well or better than some of the more well known brands.</li>
    <li> Very helpful on my haands,  arms etc.</li>
    <li> I looooove this lotion! ! It soothes dry skin and heals skin irritations like mosquito bites. I was itching so bad after I had 2 mosquito bites on my leg,  after I put this lotion on, it stopped the itch and healed them I absolutely love this lotion</li>
    <li> kept skin very healthy use everyday</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry hands and thus is the best lotion I&#x27;ve found.  It is not greasy at all and hardly has a fragrance.  If I use it daily my dry skin is gone!</li>
    <li> Everything went as expected - no problems - The whole process was seamless - Even with a broken bottle, the replacement was seamless - as always the purchase was pleasant</li>
    <li> this is a good size for the price, it is smooth and stays on for a long time, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I am going through radiation treatments for breast cancer. My doc first gave me a greasy ointment, aquaphor, a vasaline  type product. But he said I could try a cream, and after trying other samples I discovered Gold Bond Ultimate. OMG, it WORKED! It is cool and healing and the most wonderful product I have tried. I need to shower it off before I get the treatment, and then as soon as I get home I slather it on a few times a day and before bedtime. It softened the burned skin right away. Its been wonderful. Not sure if I will be able to use it if my burns start to blister, but the doc said it might help speed the healing and prevent the skin from drying too much during the last weeks of radiation. Wish the american cancer society had suggested this and not make us going through suffering this painful treatment side effect, when there is a product like this available, over the counter, not a prescription.  Anyone else use it for this?</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. I get bad winter skin including itchy irritated skin, dry patches...all that. Everyday after I shower I put this stuff on and now my skin is amazing. Best stuff on the market. It&#x27;s a bit thick, so in the summer it may be too much, but that&#x27;s the only bad thing I can think of for this product.</li>
    <li> The best cream I have ever used so far, it even works better than the powder I use to avoid feet transpiration. Amazing.</li>
    <li> Amazon had the best price on this lotion and it is a lot better then other brands.</li>
    <li> Good product, but mine had a broken pump.</li>
    <li> Though pricey, it&#x27;s a good lotion.  We use it daily</li>
    <li> light, clean, fresh scent. absorbs quickly. thick but not greasy!</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite lotion for dry skin. I have tried others that are extremely oily and greasy, but this is the best.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion, it really works for me. I really like the soft scent.</li>
    <li> Love this. noticed a difference right away. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Have used Gold Bond Lotion for years.  Can&#x27;t beat it for keeping skin soft!</li>
    <li> Not what I thought I ordered but I love gold bond</li>
    <li> Best Lotion in the world looking for a lotion that will mosterize hydrate and repair skin to absolute beautiful not doubt no lotion can compare to but I love cetaphil hydrating lotion as too Very great products</li>
    <li> Got two some how but will use.  Have very sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Gold bond is great, but the pumps  don&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Love this product for my feet and knees. It really works to keep them soft after a shower (while your still moist) applying with in 3-5 minutes after a shower is supposed to be the best times for any lotion to do the best job on your skin. Enjoy</li>
    <li> Living in Denver you still don&#x27;t feel the heat in the hot dry weather and easy to burn your skin.  This makes a perfect help with that with the aloe and that great lotion.  Does double duty on the burn or just to wear for everyday.</li>
    <li> The pump was broken which makes the lotion almost worthless.</li>
    <li> Great product, It does exactly as the product describe on the bottle. I like it will purchases again.</li>
    <li> i find Gold Bond products great!</li>
    <li> THE BEST!!!!  Just try it.  New soft skin.</li>
    <li> AWESOME&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; i have bad eczema this helps alot I do need dr prescribe medication but gold bond is the best I tried them all which they had a body wash.</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly and as described.</li>
    <li> This lotion is great. The quality is great and has a fresh feel when I apply it to my skin. My skin tends to get a lot drier during the winter months so I am glad I found this lotion instead of relying on a humidifier. This lotion will last at least 24 hrs on your skin. I usually apply it on my whole body right after a shower and it feels great. I also put it on my face and doesn’t feel sticky at all. The aloe is great to keep your skin radiant and I feel like this lotion has done that for me. The scent is not bad. I like the aloe and tea herb scent it has. This bottle will last you a long time especially if you don’t need it constantly like me. I noticed that buying it on here saves me a lot of money rather than getting a smaller one at my local stores.</li>
    <li> Pretty good and smells nice.  Somewhat effective in healing my skin irritations.</li>
    <li> This is one of the very best lotions I have used for dry skin.  It is not greasy and the moisturizing lasts all day.</li>
    <li> The lotion was fine, but the top/pump arrived broken, so I&#x27;m going to have to buy something to dump the lotion in.  I gave them four stars because they are refunding without me having to return a liquid product, and it was clearly a new bottle, just defective. Still like the lotion a lot.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion as it soaks in fairly fast and keeps my skin moisturized during the driest winter days and the reduced humidity cause by the dry air of the furnace.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff. I don&#x27;t know where I ran across it but I&#x27;ve been buying it ever since and it&#x27;s perfect. It doesn&#x27;t smell too strong and lasts a long time (and through a hand washing - that&#x27;s important!)</li>
    <li> Good lotion, but the dispenser is broken.</li>
    <li> This stuff works good at moisturizing my hands. And getting rid of dry, cracking, bloody knuckles pretty quickly and effectively. But it is a bit greasy. And the cream is very thick. I found myself having problems using it because I couldn&#x27;t really touch anything after I used it, it never really dried or absorbed completely like other lotions do. no matter how little I used, there was always residue even hours later that would get on everything I touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its good for if you just put some on, and sit on the couch watching tv or a movie or something. And it gets washed off a little while later when you use the bathroom. But I wouldn&#x27;t use it if you are going to be touching things after. At least give it some time before washing it off because it does work pretty fast.</li>
