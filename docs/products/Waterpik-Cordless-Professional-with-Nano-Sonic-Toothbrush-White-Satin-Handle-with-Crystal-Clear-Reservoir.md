      <li>I still use the original as it&#x27;s bullet proof and works great, my dentist thinks so to.</li>

      <li>To be fair to water pik, this was originally designed as a travel pik.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty happy with it</li>
      <li>The manual (or was it a reviewer) indicates that a full charge is good for about a week.  </li>

      <li>I love this thing....</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s lightweight yet solid and fits my hand perfectly.</li>

      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>i like the water flosser, better that using the floss.</li>
      <li>I love this.</li>
      <li>Glad to cancel my order as it was not in stock, but asked why my machine died...</li>
      <li>I like that it&#x27;s portable or not connected to anything, but it would be better if you could change the pressure of the water.</li>
      <li>Not my favorite.</li>
      <li>Sooo much better than floss and picks.  </li>
      <li>Great deal, fast shipping</li>
      <li>Floss is much better.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without my waterpik.</li>
    <li> Chamber leaks occasionally.</li>
    <li> this item is good for what i need.  One thing i would have liked was a little bigger water capacity.</li>
    <li> I complete waste of money! The water pic needs to be held straight up or after just a few seconds the pump will not pick up the water in the handle. It&#x27;s also VERY bulky and even on high pressure it has very low pressure. Run away! Don&#x27;t purchase this product</li>
    <li> Great help with my gum disease.</li>
    <li> Works great! My dentist is happy.</li>
    <li> the waterpick with the basin is better</li>
    <li> It was a nice idea but it was really really awful. It just did nothing, water came out like a gentle rain. It can&#x27;t hold enough water to last more than a minute. Get the plug in type with the larger tank. Those are wonderful. This failed miserably and I&#x27;m surprised they are still selling it.</li>
    <li> I liked the product. Easy to use, clean perfectly the gaps between the teeth. has enough pressure compared to sink model</li>
    <li> I needed to take my waterpik on trips and this is one I can do. It is a water powered flossing.</li>
    <li> Why are these things Always soooo noisy !!!  But it works just fine</li>
    <li> THESE ARE GREAT. WE RECOMMEND THEM TO EVERYONE @ OUR DENTAL OFFICE</li>
    <li> The water container leads</li>
    <li> I am pleased with this Waterpik.  The low setting has pretty firm water pressure, at least a 2-3 on my countertop version, the high setting is maybe 4-5.  It has a hole on the side so you can hold it sideways under the faucet to fill it with water, that is great in case you have a shallow sink or a low faucet.  The reservoir is not very big and I didn&#x27;t time myself using it, so I&#x27;ll guess around 30 seconds on Low per fill up.  It was shorter on the High setting.  But it just made me be more efficient and use it quickly.  The whole point of getting the portable is for when I&#x27;m away from home and most likely won&#x27;t be spending my usual LONG time cleaning my braces.  If you have braces, I recommend the ortho tip (it came with it).  I use the the jet tip to clean the gumline and the ortho tip to scrub on the front, top and bottom of my brackets.  I&#x27;ve only used it once, so I&#x27;ll update after I see how long the battery lasts.</li>
    <li> Very smooth transaction.  Quality product.</li>
    <li> everything is fine apart from it&#x27;s volum. it&#x27;s too big for small hand. but the water will last about 30 seconds only when it&#x27;s full filled.</li>
    <li> so far so good i had one for year i did not like it but this one sames okay i hope</li>
    <li> great product and timely delivery</li>
    <li> Works great in my opinion. Doesnt take up too much space on the counter. Has 2 speeds. I have been using the slower speed and works fine. I used the second speed a few times and my gums were bleeding in a few spots. But boy, did my mouth feel clean! It takes 2 dill ups for high spped and the entire mouth. Vey happy so far!!!</li>
    <li> Rec&#x27;d. product earlier than estimated and happy with the use of it.</li>
    <li> This works so great....loved mine so much I bought one for my grandson too!  Love that it is smaller/cordless compared to the big tank one.  Seems less messy too.</li>
    <li> Received this as a gift and love it!&lt;br /&gt;Excellent quality, a really great product.&lt;br /&gt;Vendor was fantastic. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Very happy with it.  Came quickly, great price and works like a champ.</li>
    <li> Works as described but if you have a regular Waterpik you will be disappointed. Not enough power and doesn&#x27;t hold enough water. I bought it for travel so it was sufficient</li>
    <li> Excellent price for a great Cordless Water Flosser!</li>
    <li> Works well and the battery last long</li>
    <li> Nice idea, but awkward and messy to use.  I returned it.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Very convenient being cordless and tubeless. Could be slightly more powerfull. Just slightly. My DDS would probably say it was fine....  :-)</li>
    <li> Product lacks power is bulky, hard to use and messy. Love the standard water-pic but would not ever use this unit except in emergencies. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Well, silly me.  I thought that a&amp;#34; portable&amp;#34;  Waterpik could be used on travel. How wrong I was.  I have to stay in the confines of North America, otherwise it will self-destruct.  The fine print states that the electronics are only compatible with our system.  It does not state anywhere in bold print  - DO NOT USE FOR FOREIGN TRAVEL - DO NOT USE WITH ADAPTERS OR CONVERTERS.  (Every other appliance that I bring on foreign travel does not have that prohibition.)  After calling Waterpik, I found out that I am out of luck as far as getting a replacement.  My waterpik is destined for the trash.  Even though others have encountered the unfortunate demise of their unit because of use outside the US, Waterpik has not opted to make their instructions any clearer.</li>
    <li> I just got braces (lingual on the top, regular on bottom) and this thing is a life saver. I get so much stuck in my braces after eating, this thing makes it super easy just to blast it all clear. I like the handheld version--I did not want to take up counter space with the larger counter-top model. So far I am happy with it.</li>
    <li> Useful when on the road. Water tank empties faster than I was expecting.</li>
    <li> functionally good, but ultimately terrible quality, i got about 5 or so uses before it failed to charge</li>
    <li> Better attachments. Toothbrush action very weak.</li>
    <li> We cannot be without one of these.  I just love them.</li>
    <li> Great alternative for portable water pic.  Easy to use.  Filling chamber now more accessible but concerned that plug on opposite side may still allow water to run over open plug area.</li>
    <li> Excellent easy to use very little maintenance</li>
    <li> I drips all over the place</li>
    <li> One of my favorite things</li>
    <li> I love this thing.... awesome</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold much water....must be held upright, hard to do back bridges if you can&#x27;t tilt it.</li>
    <li> I bought this flosser twice. It works well, but not for a long time. Both times, the rechargeable battery started malfunctioning within half a year. I will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> These things are brilliant. I wish it held more water in the reservoir but other than that it works really well. I&#x27;m pretty happy with it, it&#x27;s simple to use and if you&#x27;re careful, you won&#x27;t get water everywhere (I recommend leaning over the sink or taking it into the shower with you).  I like feeling super clean in my mouth, especially since floss doesn&#x27;t always catch everything. You can also mix antibacterial solutions into the water for extra protection or use it with mouth-wash if you hate gargling.</li>
    <li> THIS PICK IS A BEAUTY AND MAKES FOR CLEAN TEETH. HOWEVER,THIS WATER FLOSSER DOES NOT COME WITH A FLASHLIGHT, A VIBRATING HANDLE, A BACKSCRATCHER OR A BLOWER.. BUT IT WORKS FOR ME. CARRY ON.</li>
    <li> The reservior is far too small and it is hard to reach my bottom inside teeth without spilling all over the place. I wish I had gotten another model.</li>
    <li> Really useful for travelling abroad.</li>
    <li> Just got braces as an adult, and have a corded Waterpik at home which I find essential to use every time after eating to clean out the food stuck in the brackets/wires.  I needed something to use at work after lunch so decided to try this cordless model for ease of use in the office bathroom.  It works pretty well.  They have to strike a balance between being handheld and having sufficient capacity for use.  I need to fill the container two times per use, which isn&#x27;t too much of a hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reasons for rating it down one star:  Only 2 pressure settings for the jet.  Low is a little too low, and high is pretty good, but could also see some people needing higher strength.  Would be nice to have a little more control over this setting.  Battery life isn&#x27;t that great.  The manual (or was it a reviewer) indicates that a full charge is good for about a week.  I only got about 2 or 3 cleaning sessions - but keeping in mind that is 6 tank fills worth - so their estimate is probably based on 1 fill, 1x per day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also used this while traveling, and it was definitely more convenient to pack vs a traditional unit.</li>
    <li> Very cumbersome to use. Maybe I&#x27;m too old to teach/learn new tricks.</li>
    <li> The comment is on product accessories and not on product performance.  I had to return the product since it did not come with international voltage charger.  That is a strong limitation for a device to be used on travel!  I&#x27;d originally selected a model that had dual voltage charger.  As I was ordering that, this model appeared as an updated model option and hence I selected this assuming that the updated model will have all the features of the earlier model and then some.  When the product arrived I found that it had a charger that only worked with 110V.  I had to leave on international travel without the Waterpik and have had to suffer significant inconvenience in my personal dental care.</li>
    <li> Much better than our other brand</li>
    <li> My old waterpik was at the end of it&#x27;s life so time for a new one. It holds a charge for a long time. I think I charge mine every 4 days and that is with using it 3 times a day.</li>
    <li> I spent a fortune on implants and my dentist insisted I use this. I wish he had insisted years ago...I love it!</li>
    <li> too large, not easy to clean</li>
    <li> My dental technician advised that I get a Waterpik for the pockets in my gums.  I have always flossed, but she said the pik would get under the gums where the floss doesn&#x27;t reach.  I have been using if faithfully and later next month I will find out if my pockets are better.  For now, I have gotten used to the water flying around--always turn the unit off before you take it out of your mouth!  And lean into the sink so the water can drain out of your mouth while  you are running it.  It does take all the food from between my teeth and is faster than flossing.  I think I&#x27;ll safe money not having to buy floss.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this Waterpik! Lightweight and very easy to use. This product does a much better job then the old fashion &#x27;string&#x27; flossing, (getting into places hard to reach with string floss. Leaving your mouth with a really fresh feeling!) Great for Dental Crowns and Implants. Best of all, it&#x27;s cordless. Easy set-up and great for traveling! If you&#x27;re in the market for a better way to floss, I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Works just fine.  No complaints here.</li>
    <li> Love this device, I add mouthwash to the water tank and it leaves my mouth feeling refreshed!</li>
    <li> Works good just bulky.</li>
    <li> The charge doesn&#x27;t last as long as the reviews I read before I made the purchase.  Works ok just really messy.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a replacement from a previous cordless waterpok that died. The speed control didn&#x27;t work. Amazon even sent me a second one and it didn&#x27;t work either. I&#x27;ll be trying a different brand this time.</li>
    <li> I have braces and the toothbrush alone doesn&#x27;t get all the food that is stuck in my teeth.  I travel with this one and have been impressed with the job it does.  A little bulky, but well worth it.</li>
    <li> As expected, just what I needed......a little messy, but they all are...water dribbling down my chis is ok</li>
    <li> Fabulous Product !!!!</li>
    <li> a little bulky for the hand to hold but works great</li>
    <li> I like that it&#x27;s portable or not connected to anything, but it would be better if you could change the pressure of the water. Although, you get used to the high pressure.</li>
    <li> I have only used the item a few times and it is too soon to really evaluaite it. Filling the tank tends to be messy.</li>
    <li> great price, great product, 2 products in one. What else can you ask for? I used the waterpik for two weeks prior seeing my dentist and he noticed a difference in my teeth and my teeth don&#x27;t lie....thank you, great choice....I recommended!</li>
    <li> Wish I had this a long time ago.  This makes flossing a pleasure and is more effective than anything I have ever tried and struggled with for years and years.</li>
    <li> This is my second identical product--the first one lasted 18 months; then it became too difficult to keep the water tank clean.  My teeth feel so much cleaner after using the Waterpik flosser!</li>
    <li> Water capacity is too small, use the time to add 3 times</li>
    <li> I bought this in April, the batteries died in July.  After charging it now runs for about 2 minutes. This is the second one I&#x27;ve had with the same problem. Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Update: I contacted Waterpik right after I wrote this. After a couple of emails explaining the problem, they sent me a brand new replacement Water Flosser. This one has been going strong since I got it: good water pressure and holds a charge for over a week (with two people using it nightly). Excellent customer service, excellent replacement product. Updated rating to 4 stars.</li>
    <li> this waterpik was better than expected battery lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> This flossing unit works as advertised.  Like the convenience of the portable tank.  Generally have to fill it twice for a session - maybe 3 times depending if I&#x27;m working a specific area in concentration.</li>
    <li> Great waterpik. Had one before but the rechargeable battery wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge any more. They seem to have made some slight improvements over the old one with the cord connection. Bought two; one for my son and one to replace my old one. Have tried other brands in the past but they can&#x27;t beat the Waterpik.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Can&#x27;t wait to hear what my dentist thinks.  Came quickly and exactly as shown</li>
    <li> If it wern&#x27;t for the lack of a charging light that could indicate when charged, and an utterlessly useless battery opereated electric toothbrush assessory, I&#x27;d rate this 5 star.</li>
    <li> The water flosser is fine. I had one that finally broke after several years. This one looks the same but I don&#x27;t think the quality of the material is as good. It just feels lighter. With that said it does the job. The toothbrush is worthless. Don&#x27;t by the flosser just to get a power brush. It has no power. You might as well use a manual toothbrush. This brush vibrates a little but does nothing more.</li>
    <li> Easier to handle then counter model and easier to transport. Recommend it.</li>
    <li> Was a gift and she said she liked using it.</li>
    <li> As others have said, the battery fails very quickly - in my case, just short of two months and it wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge.  I disassembled the unit thinking water may have leaked into the battery compartment but all was dry. Incidentally, it&#x27;s a well built device except for the weak battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I considered replacing the battery but for a few dollars more I bought a ToiletTree Products as a replacement that&#x27;s going strong.</li>
    <li> This is the second one of these I have bot in the last 10 years.  I still use the original as it&#x27;s bullet proof and works great, my dentist thinks so to. I don&#x27;t like to use dental floss as it gets caught all the time, and the water pic works great and is so easy.  I got this second one for my wife as it&#x27;s just easer then changing tips and transferring it from one sink to the other.</li>
    <li> Both, the flosser and the toothbrush work just fine. They are great for the health of the gums and keep the tartar plaque from growing.</li>
    <li> Got a defected device, does not charge up</li>
    <li> this model, like the last blue model, has a two year warranty.  The water power thought is 2-3x more forceful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My last blue model lasted 2 years 3 months. I think thtat is because i listened to prior reviewers and made sure the device portal was dry before plgging in. To be fair to water pik, this was originally designed as a travel pik. They didn&#x27;t anticipate that customers with little counter space would use it daily. However they really should make the battery replaceable.  Or redesign to work more like a toothbrush that sits in the charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The crazy one is the new model that hooks right up to the shower. I have NO idea how you could clean it. And i like to put a squirt if mouthwash in mine with the water-- not sure if you can do that with that model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate all the waste and the environmental damage from throwing out rechargeable battery, but will reluctantly accept two years as a good run, if they haven&#x27;t been able to improve that, especially given the great increase in flossing power.</li>
    <li> I am loving it so far, but ask me again in a year.  No review should immediately be done on anything that should last a long time.</li>
    <li> I love my Waterpik! It cleans my teeth very well and it&#x27;s small enough to pack in my suitcase! Winner!</li>
    <li> I have the hard wired waterpik and I reviewed it with 5 stars. My wife and I liked it so much we felt a need to take it with us on travels so we purchased this cordless model. It has, in my opinion several design flaws such as the need to keep it vertical while flossing, but the main problem is the lack of power. It simply does not feel like it does the job. My wife and I both agreed it wasn&#x27;t worth taking home and left it in the hotel trash. Buy the hard wired waterpik, it is fantastic! For travel, pack some floss.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with my purchase, especially that it&#x27;s cordless.</li>
    <li> More powerful then expected, love it</li>
    <li> Excellent product, I&#x27;d recommend to all!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, but pricy with Canadian exchange etc.</li>
    <li> This product is incredible. It makes flossing simple and quick. I have to refill it twice per flossing session and charge it once per week, which I find a simple task for such a great product. It does make a bit of noise.</li>
    <li> This is a game changer.  Sooo much better than floss and picks.  I have an implant, my son is in braces, and the rest of the family would rather not floss.  But, this has really changed our oral hygiene.  I can&#x27;t believe how much it shakes loose even after I have brushed.  The non-flossers in the family are actually flossing.  I will buy a second one to send with my daughter when she returns to college.</li>
    <li> Love this product....</li>
    <li> Really like the 3 intensity levels, long lasting charge.</li>
    <li> it does not have very strong stream even though charged!!!!!!! dont like</li>
    <li> Pretty pleased with my waterpik. I don&#x27;t mind having to fill it up a few times to do all my teeth. It has a strong stream, which is good, I need it for my bridge. It doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of room either, it fits right on my tiny counter. I do use it in the shower, I think that just makes sense, you&#x27;re spraying water into you mouth! I recommend this waterpik.</li>
    <li> Love it!! Works Geat!  No Mess! Excellent quality, great price!!! You can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> Love this.  Even bought one for family  member</li>
    <li> This model does not come with the periodontal attachment for deep cleaning below the gumline, even though the description says it will.  When I contacted Waterpik Inc, the customer service rep said the cordless model is not recommended for deep cleaning because the water pressure is too high and can damage the gums and cannot be turned low enough for recommended usage.  I returned my product for this reason and ordered the recommended WP-660.  It is a $20 savings over Waterpik Inc&#x27;s price.</li>
    <li> The power of the spray is fine. There is not enough space for water in the container to waterpik your entire mouth.  You have to refill to complete the process.</li>
    <li> Water power is good and easy to use. It would be easier if water could poor from the top.</li>
    <li> Solid product. Heavy spray,on low. Would buy same,again, if needed. After first charge, still working.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Has an adjustment for water delivery when using so it doesn&#x27;t produce too harsh or too little of pressure.</li>
    <li> I love this. It does the job and it&#x27;s easy to take with me.</li>
    <li> It met all I expected</li>
    <li> I love going to the dentist, but I hate having to lie to him when he asks how often i floss. Now I&#x27;m excited to go to my next appointment because I use this wonderful device every single day. It cleans my teeth and massages my gum and makes it much easier to floss. I&#x27;ve actually put some of the mouthwash in and it also makes rinsing very nice. It also makes it easier when I brush and seems to make my teeth much cleaner for longer. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I find that I still need to use dental floss.</li>
    <li> worst water pick EVER has no power or force  to clean between gums</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed. Fast and effective especially if you have brackets. Strongly recommend you!</li>
    <li> This is a terrible product.  The water force on the Waterpik is very low and really does a very poor job of cleaning.  Floss is much better.  Also the unit takes up a lot of space.  The electric toothbrush delivers such weak cleaning action you are better off doing it manually. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this inferior product</li>
    <li> Still charging, but like it already. The ON/Off is a slide, not a push - which fails 9 out of 10 times on my old Waterpik Rechargeable.  Got 4 out of 6 picks .... toothbrush (battery included) ... all in all, looks like a keeper.</li>
    <li> Great deal, fast shipping</li>
    <li> Nice idea but water reservoir too small and lot setting too weak</li>
    <li> Just the best.  The battery life is way too short, so you have to carry the charger on  a 3 day trip, but it does perform as advertised.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Easy to fill, use, and recharge.  Bonus electric toothbrush a great free add on.</li>
    <li> I sent this to 5 family members and myself.  Everyone was pleased.  It travels easily and uses regular tap water.</li>
    <li> Disappointed.  Not as powerful as I thought It would be.</li>
    <li> Rather awkward to use and much less power than the plug in model</li>
    <li> I am so disappointed with this product. I ordered it in February, worked great for 4 months then started slowing down. Before the 2nd week in July it went dead. Do Not buy it!</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace the same unit. The batteries died in the old one after a few years. Works fine.</li>
    <li> I struggle with thorough flossing, and this does help.  It also makes an enormous mess.  Using warmer water makes the process more comfortable.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a pretty bad product. A waste of money.</li>
    <li> Nice bonus toothbrush with it</li>
    <li> Amazing what comes out of your mouth!</li>
    <li> Only one of the four tips included in the product actually fits snuggly! The other three don&#x27;t snap in and are pushed off when I try to use them. Looks like poor quality control or there&#x27;s something wrong with the base or 3 of the 4 tips. If I lived in the US I would send it back for replacement but since I live in Colombia it isn&#x27;t worth the price. I&#x27;ll have to settle using only one of the four tips.</li>
    <li> I like the cordless toothbrush</li>
    <li> Love it. I can bring it anywhere to use it. My teeth feel so clean after I use it. I give it a thumbs up.</li>
    <li> This is a super product.  Easy to use and cleans very, very well.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t hold enough water, and is awkward to hold it to my mouth.hard to refill with water.</li>
    <li> Dentis recommend great does what is expected</li>
    <li> Really does a nice job cleaning your caps.</li>
    <li> Works really well, charge last days.</li>
    <li> Great tool to have when you&#x27;re feeling lazy.</li>
    <li> This product is underpowered, but more importantly the water well is way too small to do the job.</li>
    <li> Wife loved it is great for trips and can be easily packed in the bag with the shampoo and stuff. Great when you aren&#x27;t home with a full sized unit.</li>
    <li> Box was supposed to include nano-sonic toothbrush, 2 jet tips, 1 plaque seek tip, 1 orthodontic tip, and the WP440 Water Flosser.  Only thing included was the water flosser!  No toothbrush and no tips for the flosser.&lt;br /&gt;Box did include OtoClear  tips for ear irrigation in which I have absolutely no interest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Supplier really screwed up my order!</li>
    <li> This is the third waterpik cordless I have owned. This new and improved appears to be a bit of a step backwards. The power is just not there even after charging for 48 hours. I definitely prefer the older model.  I suppose if I did not have the comparison it would be ok. Not my favorite.</li>
    <li> Works well. Battery could last longer after charge, but overall worth the money.</li>
    <li> Works Great,  Use it every day.  Cleans your teeth very well.</li>
    <li> The function of this Waterpik was basically okay, in that it did the job fairly well, albeit messy, as others previously reported, but after less than 3 months, the door/clip that holds the water in the unit popped off, seriously impacting the use of the machine. Another less than par aspect is that the emptying of water after use is difficult, if not impossible; it&#x27;s difficult to empty all of water out of the reservoir, hence setting up a great scenario for bacteria collection (not what you want to spread around your mouth, gums, teeth!). Additionally, the toothbrush accompanying the unit, which I guess is the reason for its heftier price, is all but ridiculous. You can get more, and better, action using an old-fashioned Oral B that you use, yourself, without a battery. Overall I&#x27;m disappointed and won&#x27;t be purchasing another one of this brand. I&#x27;m even more disappointed that I can&#x27;t return this one for a refund. I&#x27;m sold on oral irrigation, just not this brand.</li>
    <li> It;s OK but for me I didn&#x27;t find it quite powerful enough even when fully charged. It does leave your mouth feeling clean so if you&#x27;re fanatical about oral hygiene, one of these on top of regular flossing isn&#x27;t a bad idea.</li>
    <li> I had to change my opinion of this product after owning it.  Does what it says it will do, but is not as powerful as a countertop unit.  How could it be, look at the difference in the power generated.  My problem is it is too fragile.  Had my carry on shoulder back at the airport with my water flosser inside.  It dropped from a distance of about 3 feet.  Now I can understand the reservoir cracking, it&#x27;s plastic and did so at the seam at the bottom. What I don&#x27;t understand is why it would kill the unit.  The battery charges for up to 10 seconds of partial performance.  When I thought it was just the reservoir, I order a new one from Waterpik, when I realized it was also the battery I called Waterpik to cancel the order. Customer service was completely ambivalent. Glad to cancel my order as it was not in stock, but asked why my machine died...NEVER!!!  I recommend Toilet Trees model.  Much more powerful and CAN&#x27;T be any more fragile.</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace earlier battery powered waterpik.  Still has the same problem with water running down your arm.  Good but not great.  Less power than the plug in model and less power than older battery powered one.  Now using as an addition to flossing not as a replacement due to the limited power.</li>
    <li> 45seconds goes very fast</li>
    <li> i like the water flosser, better that using the floss.</li>
    <li> Bought this one twice... I thought I got a lemon the first time. Forget it. It is nice and compact but stops working after about 3 months/ Does anyone make a waterpik that lasts?</li>
    <li> No matter how long I charge it for, it doesn&#x27;t run for more than 5 or 10 seconds. It&#x27;s useless. Any chance of sending me one that charges up and in fact works ?</li>
    <li> The product is well received. It could be better if the adaptor able to accept wide voltage range because it designed for travel (portable).</li>
    <li> I dont need a 5 dollar vibrating toothbrush...  that bonus is just to jack the price up&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this unit work well ....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;super convenient being cordless...  easy to refill.. (just stick it under the running water) .. powerful enough to knock out junk between teeth, and clean gum line without causing damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have Periodontal Disease .. like 65% of all adults ..  that is when food gets between your tooth and the gum, them bacteria feeds on that food and the bacteria excrete an acid that dissolves the bone in your jaw..  when the disease gets bad.. that bad breath that some people get is there gums and jawbones decomposing and literally rotting way in there mouth.. when you lose enough jawbone you teeth fall out.. and you cant get implants because there is not enough bone to hold them in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can stop and prevent periodontal disease with this tool..  I am living proof ..  this is the tool&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the &amp;#34;Water Pik Orthodontic Tips&amp;#34;  you can order on Amazon ..  after blasting stuff off and between teeth ..  use WARM water and shoot the stream downwards.. like you trying to get it between the tooth and gum (you are trying to remove the food and bacteria from under the gum and under the tooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;immediately after the water pik with the gumline open and clean the ONLY over the counter product that can effectively kill the bacteria is Listerine.  (google periodontal disease and learn) .. big old mouthful and BRUSH it into the the gumline .. your trying to get that Listerine UNDER you tooth where the nastiness is happening ..  this must happen everyday after every meal .. or you will lose your teeth.. (dentures cost about $4500 dollars, they are not comfortable and change the taste of your food)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and you can NOT use scope or flavored Listerine because it full of syrup made from saccharin (which has no calories but is FOOD to the germs your trying to kill) - good news  Listerine now has a product call Naturals - contains ZERO saccharin, but uses natural mint .. clean, clear, taste is lightly mint - although you will get used to the original over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;good luck..  it does work ..  this machine is a miracle tool .. its not perfect but its better that all the competitors (i have owned toilettree, and panasonic version - both failures)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this tool will last about a year ...  then the nicad batteries will give out..  so.. are your teeth worth $5 dollars a month ??l Naturals - contains ZERO saccharin, but uses natural mint .. clean, clear, taste is lightly mint - although you will get used to the original over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;good luck..  it does work ..  this machine is a miracle tool .. its not perfect but its better that all the competitors (i have owned toilettree, and panasonic version - both failures)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this tool will last about a year ...  then the nicad batteries will give out..  so.. are your teeth worth $5 dollars a month ??</li>
    <li> Great product -- cleans teeth thoroughly</li>
    <li> Terrible.  I bought my first one and after 2 weeks the the unit didn&#x27;t work.  I returned it and got another one.  The exact thing happened with the second unit.  It slows down and you need to change the pick because particles of food get into it and you can&#x27;t get it out.  Don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
    <li> It came on time and in great shape, its a quality product and everything was as expected.</li>
    <li> Good to use somewhat unwieldy but overall good.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s somewhat cumbersome to hold and I don&#x27;t now why it should be disconnected for each use (also a bother.)</li>
    <li> Not as powerful as I had hoped</li>
    <li> I like this version better than my previous one; however ensure you charge once a week to maintain good pressure.</li>
    <li> I like this Waterpik. I&#x27;ve had it for over a month now and it&#x27;s been great. I haven&#x27;t been back to the dentist since getting the Waterpik so I have no professional feedback to share, I can only provide my personal opinion. Don&#x27;t want to gross anyone out but I&#x27;ve used this after a thorough brushing and rinsing and it dislodged food particles I didn&#x27;t even know was there. I&#x27;ll never go back to regular flossing if I can help it. This is ten times better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years ago I had the regular Waterpik which I found clunky and space-cramping in my bathroom. Not only do I get them same oral result from this one, it&#x27;s so much less cumbersome and easier to use. I&#x27;m not limited to standing directly by the machine. I can walk around. I&#x27;d also thought that it would be too big to fit comfortably in my hand (I have small hands) but it isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s lightweight yet solid and fits my hand perfectly. 4 stars because that rubber stopper door is really flimsy. It snapped off on me one. I snapped it right back on so no harm no foul, but that could have been better made. But all in all, I would definitely recommend.</li>
