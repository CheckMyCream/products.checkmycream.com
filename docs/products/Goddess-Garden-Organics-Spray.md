      <li>I have this sunscreen, and I love it!</li>
      <li>The opinions I have expressed are my own.</li>
      <li>The smell was nice and the lotion was not too greasy.  </li>
      <li>The sunscreen is effective and keeps sunburn away.</li>
      <li>I had to apply the product VERY lightly to keep from looking like a purple-white ghost, so I wasn&#x27;t as protected from the sun as I would have liked.  </li>
      <li>Very happy to have found a natural sunscreen in a spray version.</li>
      <li>It goes on easily!</li>
      <li>Easy to run on, works great and is a good price considering it&#x27;s natural sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is more of a spray lotion.</li>
      <li>this is perfect for my back and spraying the kids for touch ups.</li>
      <li>Make sure you put it on 20 minutes before sun exposure and continue to put on every two hours.  </li>
      <li>We all used this sunscreen and REAPPLIED it more than twice.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>I love this sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>I love this sunscreen.</li>
      <li>This sunscreen is listed as one that is safe on most of the sites detailing safe products for children.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>Ordered two more.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I received a product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
      <li>I like elta md better for a zinc based spray.</li>
      <li>Gives good protection, but is very goopy!</li>
      <li>but it is so convenient, user friendly, and safe that I&#x27;m okay with paying more.</li>
      <li>It sprays on continuously and is easily spread on the skin with your hand.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply to skin.</li>
      <li>What a huge bummer.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low-value free gift from the manufacturer for posting this review.</li>
      <li>Fortunately, I had tubes of sunscreen (sport, by Badger)</li>
      <li>It is definitely worth it!</li>
      <li>This is by far my favorite Goddess Garden sunscreen!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s ok, it makes my skin white and does not spread very easily.</li>
      <li>This sunscreen is natural and smells nice.</li>
      <li>It has a great rating from EWG.org (it&#x27;s a physical barrier, not chemical, which also means it starts working right away!), is very easy to apply, and offered more protection this summer at the beach than the sunscreen we&#x27;ve been using in the past.</li>
      <li>It does the job nicely, but it&#x27;s not the super easy to use stuff like other brands of spray on sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>One thing that is very important to me is that it is all natural.</li>
      <li>I actually prefer to see it since most sprays are lost to the air.</li>
      <li>Thank you so much for making this product!</li>
      <li>now if they can only find a way to make sure that all the sunscreen in the tubes can be squeezed out, without resorting to scissors and baggies.</li>
      <li>Love this sunscreen, goes on light, dries quickly, no smell...</li>
      <li>I was not required or compelled to write a positive review.</li>
      <li>I researched a long time, many people had issues with organic sunscreens.</li>
      <li>It sprays in a continuous stream, which is hugely helpful when applying to multiple children at the beach.  </li>
      <li>Now I have a whole can</li>
      <li>I appreciate the aloe in the formula - zinc can be really drying to yhe skin</li>
      <li>i stumbled upon this at whole foods and had to buy it.</li>
      <li>My whole family got very sunburnt.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>One of the more natural sunscreens in a spray - finally!</li>
      <li>It is somewhat thinner than the others, so it spreads on better and doesn&#x27;t really look white like many other natural sunscreens.</li>
      <li>My main use for this is getting the kids ready and out the door for camp in the morning.</li>
      <li>This is our new go-to summer sunscreen.</li>
      <li>It does have to be rubbed in, but it doesn&#x27;t leave any white residue like most of the other organic and natural sunscreens.  </li>
      <li>Please make a version that sprays-on clear.</li>
      <li>However, it is basically the old school &amp;#34;white stuff&amp;#34; that you have to smear in.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried ALOT of natural sunscreen and they tend to not work.  </li>
      <li>My family and I were boating one day and it was very sunny outside.</li>
      <li>I am going to stick with the old fashioned way...</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use this as a primary sunscreen though, since it can be pricey and wouldn&#x27;t last long if applied regularly for maximum protection.</li>
      <li>It goes on white and dries clear.  </li>
      <li>It protects so well and is total natural.</li>
      <li>For that I was annoyed, but besides that I love it.</li>

<li> Now, I&#x27;m very pale complected, so maybe it&#x27;ll work better for others who aren&#x27;t so pale!</li>
<li> One can has lasted two weeks on two children with only morning use if that gives anyone indication of how long this one can lasts.</li>
<li> Yes, it is white, but I expected it to be and don&#x27;t mind.</li>
<li> This was a total waste of money - until they come out with a different applicator, don&#x27;t bother buying this.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve ride lots of different sunscreens for my family and this one is , hands down , the winner.  </li>
<li> Not what I expected, turned my skin purple</li>
<li> This is the third bottle (out of 2 bought, and one replaced by the company) that has frozen after a few applications.  </li>
<li> I typically start with a tube of mineral sunscreen for maximum swim protection, but this does the trick for follow up application.</li>
<li> I have had this problem with other natural sunscreens which is unfortunate.</li>
<li> Not sure you want to place a product on you kids that does not break down after weeks of exposure to rain and other weather.</li>
<li> No more or less messy on the hands/clothes than other zinc oxide products.</li>
<li> It is a little pricey</li>
<li> I bought a few of these bottles to put into Easter Baskets and for my niece&#x27;s summer-themed birthday party.&lt;br</li>
<li> I always use non-chemical sunscreens on our family but the application can be messy.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of this product.</li>
<li> I noticed others have this problem as well, and when I called the company, I mentioned that this seems to be a common problem.  </li>
<li> Just sprays lotion on your body, not a nice liquid spray.</li>
<li> It feels sticky and thick on your skin.</li>
<li> I was disappointed the spray sprayed out white lotion I had to rub in.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, it did not protect me against getting a bad burn on vacation despite constant reapplication.</li>
<li> but my kids HATE the smell &amp; texture.</li>
<li> Very disappointed.  </li>

    <li> Great sunscreen! Easy to apply, rubs in great, and best of all, it&#x27;s safe for you and the environment!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s ok, it makes my skin white and does not spread very easily. i do like that its an organic spray option though.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed.  I have used this once.  When I went to use it this weekend, the nozzle wouldn&#x27;t spray.  Now I have a whole can that I can&#x27;t use.  This was a total waste of money - until they come out with a different applicator, don&#x27;t bother buying this.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is indeed a continuous spray.  However, it is basically the old school &amp;#34;white stuff&amp;#34; that you have to smear in.  It does the job nicely, but it&#x27;s not the super easy to use stuff like other brands of spray on sunscreen.  Even once you have it rubbed on you have a white tint to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, it is &amp;#34;reef safe&amp;#34; and the ingredients meet the recommendations from environmental agencies for diving and snorkeling on coral reefs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like it, but it&#x27;s what I use when diving in protected marine parks.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply to skin. Kids used it while summer with no problem or sun burn.</li>
    <li> Good consistency. One of the more natural sunscreens in a spray - finally! Great for the beach when you&#x27;re trying to spray sandy kids!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. I like elta md better for a zinc based spray. I appreciate the aloe in the formula - zinc can be really drying to yhe skin but my kids HATE the smell &amp; texture.</li>
    <li> I researched a long time, many people had issues with organic sunscreens. I think this product is great.  You have to rub it in a bit but it works well and is not harmful to your body!</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite Goddess Garden sunscreen! It is somewhat thinner than the others, so it spreads on better and doesn&#x27;t really look white like many other natural sunscreens. It protects so well and is total natural. I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Gives good protection, but is very goopy!</li>
    <li> Great product! No scent whatsoever.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of this product. It feels sticky and thick on your skin. I have had this problem with other natural sunscreens which is unfortunate.</li>
    <li> this is perfect for my back and spraying the kids for touch ups. I typically start with a tube of mineral sunscreen for maximum swim protection, but this does the trick for follow up application. Yes, it is white, but I expected it to be and don&#x27;t mind. I actually prefer to see it since most sprays are lost to the air. It rubs in well - and I&#x27;ve never had nozzle issues. I wouldn&#x27;t use this as a primary sunscreen though, since it can be pricey and wouldn&#x27;t last long if applied regularly for maximum protection. I will definitely continue to purchase!</li>
    <li> Just sprays lotion on your body, not a nice liquid spray. Lotion feels sticky on skin all day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ride lots of different sunscreens for my family and this one is , hands down , the winner.  It sprays in a continuous stream, which is hugely helpful when applying to multiple children at the beach.  It does have to be rubbed in, but it doesn&#x27;t leave any white residue like most of the other organic and natural sunscreens.  Also, it works great - none of us have ever once gotten a burn while using this product and we spend countless hours outside at beach and pool during summer months.</li>
    <li> I loved that this was an all-natural sunscreen. Unfortunately, it did not protect me against getting a bad burn on vacation despite constant reapplication. Now, I&#x27;m very pale complected, so maybe it&#x27;ll work better for others who aren&#x27;t so pale!</li>
    <li> The smell was nice and the lotion was not too greasy.  But it didn&#x27;t blend in well at all for me.  I looked like I had spray painted myself.  I had to apply the product VERY lightly to keep from looking like a purple-white ghost, so I wasn&#x27;t as protected from the sun as I would have liked.  My quest for a cruelty-free sunscreen continues...</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen. I did have a bottle that stopped working on me, too, and I tried opening it to scoop out the remaining product and  couldn&#x27;t, so I had to just buy another bottle. For that I was annoyed, but besides that I love it.</li>
    <li> Weeks after spraying our kids with this product, the product is still stained on our driveway.  Not sure you want to place a product on you kids that does not break down after weeks of exposure to rain and other weather.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is listed as one that is safe on most of the sites detailing safe products for children. It sprays on continuously and is easily spread on the skin with your hand. The sunscreen is effective and keeps sunburn away. It is a little pricey but it is so convenient, user friendly, and safe that I&#x27;m okay with paying more.</li>
    <li> Love this sunscreen, goes on light, dries quickly, no smell...HOWEVER, and this is a BIG HOWEVER, what is the DEAL with the sprayer!!  This is the third bottle (out of 2 bought, and one replaced by the company) that has frozen after a few applications.  This works out to about $5. to $7. per application.  I noticed others have this problem as well, and when I called the company, I mentioned that this seems to be a common problem.  They apologized and replaced my unusable canisters, but the replacements FROZE as well!!!  BUMMER!!  Fortunately, I had tubes of sunscreen (sport, by Badger) that I had on the side.  I am going to stick with the old fashioned way...now if they can only find a way to make sure that all the sunscreen in the tubes can be squeezed out, without resorting to scissors and baggies. :)</li>
    <li> the zinc just doesn&#x27;t absorb in so you walk around with a white &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> My main use for this is getting the kids ready and out the door for camp in the morning. I make the camp apply tube cream sunscrean. It is more of a spray lotion. I apply it in lines on their arms and legs then rub it in. No more or less messy on the hands/clothes than other zinc oxide products. One can has lasted two weeks on two children with only morning use if that gives anyone indication of how long this one can lasts. Ordered two more.</li>
    <li> What a huge bummer. 1st bottle worked no problen. Once that bottle ran out went to use the 2 bottle and it doesn&#x27;t work AT ALL! It doesn&#x27;t even come out of the bottle and same with the 3rd bottle.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is great.  It goes on white and dries clear.  It does what it says.  It blocks the sun and prevents the burn.  It works great in water too.</li>
    <li> Very happy to have found a natural sunscreen in a spray version. It goes on easily!</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen.  Easy to run on, works great and is a good price considering it&#x27;s natural sunscreen.  I&#x27;ve tried ALOT of natural sunscreen and they tend to not work.  Finally found one that does- when you follow the instructions.  Make sure you put it on 20 minutes before sun exposure and continue to put on every two hours.  Works great if you do that!!!</li>
    <li> i stumbled upon this at whole foods and had to buy it. I always use non-chemical sunscreens on our family but the application can be messy. When I saw this I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes- application s do easy, and coverage is great! Thank you so much for making this product!</li>
    <li> Disappointed...what is the point of spray-on sunscreen if you still have to rub it in? Please make a version that sprays-on clear.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed the spray sprayed out white lotion I had to rub in. Yuck the was my point of buying a spray so I wouldn&#x27;t need to rub.</li>
    <li> I have this sunscreen, and I love it! One thing that is very important to me is that it is all natural. This sunscreen is natural and smells nice. It is also not greasy, which is great because it won&#x27;t get into your eyes when you sweat. I run a lot and this has been one of the best sunscreens I have tried. It is definitely worth it! I bought a few of these bottles to put into Easter Baskets and for my niece&#x27;s summer-themed birthday party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low-value free gift from the manufacturer for posting this review. I was not required or compelled to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with FTC 16 CFR, Part 255.</li>
    <li> We used this at the beach for a week. No one got a sunburn! Worked wonderful.</li>
    <li> This is our new go-to summer sunscreen. It has a great rating from EWG.org (it&#x27;s a physical barrier, not chemical, which also means it starts working right away!), is very easy to apply, and offered more protection this summer at the beach than the sunscreen we&#x27;ve been using in the past. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I do not recommend this product. My family and I were boating one day and it was very sunny outside. We all used this sunscreen and REAPPLIED it more than twice. My whole family got very sunburnt. This sunscreen didn&#x27;t work for us I hope this won&#x27;t happen to you. The only reason I tried this product is because it was organic.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected, turned my skin purple</li>
