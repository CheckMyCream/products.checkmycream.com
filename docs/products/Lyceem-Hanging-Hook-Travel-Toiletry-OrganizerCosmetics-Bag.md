      <li>:)</li>
      <li>and I am confident that it will suit my needs when I travel.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pleased.</li>

      <li>I love this bag I use it for my medication hair accessories and kinesiology tape for my knee.  </li>
      <li>This bag is even better quality than it looks in the picture.  </li>
      <li>my all time favorite color..love all the pockets n space..plus the hook so u can hang it while using it..perfect for travel, sleepovers, camping,etc</li>
      <li>We ordered four of these to help organize our toiletries for camping and make it easier on the kids to be able to hang their bags when using the showers.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s easy to get into and stands upright on the counter.</li>
      <li>Bag was nice, exactly what I needed, however...please stop bothering people to get them to review your items....</li>
      <li>It is very handy to use and I hang it up inside the back door of the bathroom and let it hang and can easily put in stuff and take out of stuff.  </li>
      <li>Like they say you get what you pay for, even though I think $10 is way more than what this is worth.</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s got everything I need for my shower time after a workout, and of course, the hanging hook keeps it right where I want it!  </li>
      <li>This is not your $40+ LL Bean travel bag, but I didn&#x27;t want to pay that much for an item I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d use all the time.</li>
      <li>but it held everything I needed for a trip overseas, including full sized bottles of contact stuff, conditioner, hair spray, etc.</li>
      <li>My old one had a better arrangement of smaller compartments for bottles, but it works fine and is a good size for me.</li>
      <li>It arrived quickly.  </li>
      <li>Thanks for the quick ship!</li>
      <li>Bought this bag as a gift-----couldn&#x27;t be more pleased---it&#x27;s reasonably priced and  very well made.</li>
      <li>Problems are rare but Amazon always makes right any purchase.</li>
      <li>For the price I guess its decent but its definitely cheaply made.</li>
      <li>It really is amazing how much this case holds - it doesn&#x27;t look that big</li>
      <li>It feels very strudy</li>
      <li>I really wanted to like this bag because it was the size I needed</li>
      <li>The pill bags were all small and didn&#x27;t appear to hold more than 3 or 4 pill bottles.</li>
      <li>Got it as a gift for a young adult.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a small bag to hold all my acquired medications, lotions, etc., that I could carry easily to work.</li>
      <li>It holds all my medication and leaves room for more, yet small enough to put into a carryall or book bag.</li>
      <li>My only complaint is that the large pocket is very unstructured so when it is hanging things sort of fall together rather than stay standing upright.</li>

    <li> Just what I was looking for. Excellent!!!!!</li>
    <li> Bag was nice, exactly what I needed, however...please stop bothering people to get them to review your items....sometimes we just don&#x27;t have the time or desire to do this.</li>
    <li> Love the color options and hook.  Great for our camping trips.  Got it as a gift for a young adult.</li>
    <li> It really is amazing how much this case holds - it doesn&#x27;t look that big but it held everything I needed for a trip overseas, including full sized bottles of contact stuff, conditioner, hair spray, etc. I also used it to keep my things organized while on the trip and it&#x27;s easy to get into and stands upright on the counter. I will be buying these as gifts for friends who travel!</li>
    <li> This is not your $40+ LL Bean travel bag, but I didn&#x27;t want to pay that much for an item I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d use all the time. The material is a little stiff and there are no inside zippers for pockets. However, the price was very good, the bag did exactly what I needed for our trip, and it came in all the colors that my daughter and I wanted. No mixups in the hotel or in our luggage. I&#x27;m not sure how long the plastic hook will hold out, but that can be replaced if it breaks. So far so good. I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
    <li> This bag is even better quality than it looks in the picture.  Also in the picture it looks more bluish, and it is much more purple, to my delight. It feels very strudy and I am confident that it will suit my needs when I travel.  It holds more than I thought it would!  Thanks for the quick ship!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a small bag to hold all my acquired medications, lotions, etc., that I could carry easily to work. The pill bags were all small and didn&#x27;t appear to hold more than 3 or 4 pill bottles. Then I found this bag and it&#x27;s perfect size. It expands to hold more items. It holds all my medication and leaves room for more, yet small enough to put into a carryall or book bag. Good quality and sturdy material.</li>
    <li> It is very handy to use and I hang it up inside the back door of the bathroom and let it hang and can easily put in stuff and take out of stuff.  Very handy.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t look like a big bag, but it fits a lot of stuff in it!  I love the thick material and that it has a flat base so it stands on the counter.  Just used it for a girls weekend and a family vacation, and it worked great for both!</li>
    <li> This cosmetic back is wonderful!  It really keeps things organized - has several small netted storage areas, which keep things upright.</li>
    <li> Bought this bag as a gift-----couldn&#x27;t be more pleased---it&#x27;s reasonably priced and  very well made. Would surely recommend it to others!!</li>
    <li> It arrived quickly.  However, it was smaller than I thought it would be.  The zipper on the item also broke after one use.</li>
    <li> We ordered four of these to help organize our toiletries for camping and make it easier on the kids to be able to hang their bags when using the showers. Very sturdy fabric, inside dividers/pockets are great.  Only issue I can see in the future is that the hook is plastic. I am already planning to replace it with a metal carabiner clip if/when it breaks, not a big deal.</li>
    <li> I bought this to pack my toiletries for my L&amp;D hospital bag. Fits everything I need!</li>
    <li> my all time favorite color..love all the pockets n space..plus the hook so u can hang it while using it..perfect for travel, sleepovers, camping,etc</li>
    <li> Perfect size and very cute shade of purple</li>
    <li> I ordered this bag. Instead I received something completely different from electronics. When I contacted Amazon.com I was not able to order another of these bags so they reimbursed me for the bag. The other product that I did receive was not charged to me nor did I have go through sending the product back. That is why I love AMAZON! Problems are rare but Amazon always makes right any purchase. Thank you Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> This is the perfect size for a frequent traveler. It even fit more stuff than I thought which was a pleasant surprise. My only complaint is that the large pocket is very unstructured so when it is hanging things sort of fall together rather than stay standing upright. Just a little thing but otherwise it has EVERYTHING in it now!</li>
    <li> Gave this as a gift to a friend who was looking for a small cosmetic bag to use when she was traveling.</li>
    <li> My old one had a better arrangement of smaller compartments for bottles, but it works fine and is a good size for me.</li>
    <li> Very durable and perfect size. Love it!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this bag because it was the size I needed and I liked the color. First it arrived and had an awful smell, I was considering washing it but then I noticed it only had one zipper handle going around. For the price I guess its decent but its definitely cheaply made. Like they say you get what you pay for, even though I think $10 is way more than what this is worth.</li>
    <li> Very nice toiletry bag for overnight trips and camping.</li>
    <li> I love this bag I use it for my medication hair accessories and kinesiology tape for my knee.  It is well made has the perfect number of compartments and I love the fact that I can hang it up.  I leave it hung up in my bedroom and then when I travel I just zip it up and throw it in my suitcase.  It keeps everything together and organized</li>
    <li> Product as described.  Arrived on time.  Looks good, performs well.</li>
    <li> Great bag, perfect for my needs, thoughtfully designed and well-made. Recommend!</li>
    <li> Nice bag. Has alot of room.</li>
    <li> Plenty of compartments, it&#x27;s sturdy, constructed well, and I can see it lasting for years at the gym.  It&#x27;s got everything I need for my shower time after a workout, and of course, the hanging hook keeps it right where I want it!  I purchased one for my sister too I loved it so.  :)</li>
