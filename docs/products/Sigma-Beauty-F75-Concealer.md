    <li> Feel so soft and blends so nicely. I love it!</li>
    <li> Sigma brushes are not perfect (I have a few and some have come off the handle already and some are shedding) but this concealer brush has stayed the same since I bought it and I use it every time I use concealer. I have also used it to contour my nose and it works great. This is a great brush to add to your collection and it is worth the price.</li>
    <li> These are my daughters favorite brushes she loves them great quality, super soft,&lt;br /&gt;for perfect application every time. Thank you Sigma</li>

    <li> Great concealer brush</li>
    <li> I love this brush. It reminds me of my paint brushes--very soft, high quality bristles. It is larger than I thought it would be but applies concealer perfectly. I had a MAC concealer brush before but lost it and replaced with this one. I&#x27;m glad I did. Looking forward to purchasing more Sigma brushes in the future.</li>
    <li> VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED SELLER !</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd sigma brush purchase. I loved my F81 so much that when I needed a concealer brush I ordered another sigma. I previously had a bare minerals concealer brush that I loved but couldn&#x27;t find it. I wish I was a bigger fan of this brush. I was using Benefit erase paste with it and it would clump the bristles together, causing the paste to crease on my face. Sometimes I separate the bristles with my fingers before application. Overall, I would recommend the bare minerals brush over this one.</li>
    <li> The brush is great and love it!</li>
    <li> Very nice brush. Holds together really well and quiet soft. Does an excellent job of smoothing on concealer. I ordered a few brushes and they threw in a free blending brush.</li>
    <li> So upset this brush ended up being fake. The picture is not accurate at all. You can feel it in the weight. I compared it to my actual real ones I have from the actual sigma store. So disappointed!</li>
    <li> The sigma F75-concealer brush is&lt;br /&gt;fantastic, it is the perfect size for using under your eyes,it is soft and probably one of the best concealer brushes,I have purchased.:)</li>
