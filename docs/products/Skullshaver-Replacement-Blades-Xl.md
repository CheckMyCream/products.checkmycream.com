<li> Skullshaver is a time saver, and these replacements work as expected.</li>

<li> and I&#x27;ve tried other blades and nada.</li>
<li> I am stuck with a $125 shaver that the blades cut like a dull knife.</li>
<li> They dull after about a month.</li>
<li> Very disappointed in these new replacement blades.  </li>
<li> It is not something I can fix, a washer comes off and the spring pops out, Very disappointed.  </li>

    <li> Bot this for my husband to replace blade on his Bald Eagle Smart.  Fits great, works great.</li>
    <li> While I enjoy using my razor, I have had two, what I believe, are production issues with the blades.&lt;br /&gt;BUT....in both instances, Skullshaver replaced the blades immediately.&lt;br /&gt;SO....my overall experience with Skullshaver has been 5 STARS.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  Seems to be the same as the one that came with the bald eagle.</li>
    <li> It is safe and shaves to the last drop.</li>
    <li> This works very well and eliminates the cuts and blood of a razor......be careful when cleaning as it can dislodge retaining rings and springs.....</li>
    <li> Very disappointed in these new replacement blades.  The one I used for 6 months was sharper than the two new replacement blades.</li>
    <li> Skullshaver is a time saver, and these replacements work as expected. They dull after about a month. Wish they were cheaper in price or lasted a bit longer.</li>
    <li> Cool Gift. I received these very quickly.</li>
    <li> Exact replacement for the original!!</li>
    <li> Worked quite well at removing hair, but my first one broke rather quickly and had to be replaced.</li>
    <li> Husband loves his skull shaver &amp; I do too he walks around the house a couple minutes shaving his head no mess &amp; perfect close job üëç</li>
    <li> does the job, but i wish the construction were more robust</li>
    <li> Love the product and have been using it exclusively for over a year now.... My only issue is that both of the replacement blades I recently purchased broke after about a week.  Never had that happen before so I can only assume it was a fluke of some type.  I&#x27;ve already ordered more though which goes to show how much I like the product as a whole.</li>
    <li> The newer heads break easily.  I&#x27;ve ordered replacement beds several times and usually they are fine.  The newer ones I am getting are harder to put back together after cleaning and they break easily. It is not something I can fix, a washer comes off and the spring pops out, Very disappointed.  I still have the head that came with the shaver and it&#x27;s fine.  Recent two orders, not so good.</li>
    <li> Not what I thought!! Never gets close and I&#x27;ve tried other blades and nada. My advice think before ya buy this. Would like if customer service would return calls or e-mail back!!!!</li>
    <li> The last set seemed to break easily.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used them yet but if they work as well as the ones that are on the head shaver  now  they will be excellent</li>
    <li> If I could return this shaver I would. I am stuck with a $125 shaver that the blades cut like a dull knife. I can&#x27;t even get 1 month use without having to use another razor blade set I sent an email to seller and no reply. I would not recommend the shaver let alone the blades.</li>
    <li> I bought the Butterfly Shaver Pro, the Skull Shaver Stand and a set of the two replacement shaver heads.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier with the purchase.  I&#x27;ve tried other electric razors for my legs and I could never get a really smooth shave without irritation.  This one was easy to use and clean. I like the convenience and savings of being able to purchase it in a two pack.</li>
    <li> bought it for my husband...he says the bald eagle is a true breakthrough............. great shave on my head..but..not as close a shave on my face....I clean the blades every shave.....does this device have a compartment that opens...to empty the cut off hair/beard????  no instructions,,,,,,the husband....</li>
