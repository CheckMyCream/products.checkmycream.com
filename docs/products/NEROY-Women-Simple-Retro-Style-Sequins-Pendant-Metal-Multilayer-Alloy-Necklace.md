    <li> Worth $3 but very cute. Dainty and light</li>
    <li> It turned black really fast :/</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t look like the pic. Disapointment :( Very cheap looking, looks like the jewelry you get from a kids quarter toy machine at the arcade</li>
    <li> Cheap looking buyers beware!!!</li>
    <li> Really cute and fun! Looks just like picture!</li>
    <li> Got it earlier than expected. Not as elegant as I thought it would be but I&#x27;ll still wear it.</li>
    <li> Pendants were not aligned so it did not hang straight</li>
    <li> I hv not worn it as of yet. My busy work schedule won&#x27;t allow me to. But I love it and will be in it this coming weekend. Its casual and md for that.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s not awful but the chain is a lot bigger than the one pictured and so is the circles. Longer in length as well.</li>
    <li> I only wore it 2 times and it is now completely useless. It lost its shine and looks faded and old.</li>
    <li> It looks cheap. Not recommended.</li>
    <li> Turns green after an hour</li>
    <li> Wore it a few days and it broke but it&#x27;s fixable</li>
    <li> Necklace came in as is seen in The picture, I love it!</li>
    <li> Arrived earlier than expected! Looks just like the picture. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Not the best quality but you get what you pay for. It is very cute and dainty though, which is exactly what I was going for! If you want a necklace that is really cute and you don&#x27;t care if it breaks, then I recommend this one!</li>
    <li> The jewelry looks good in the picture but not the same upon arrival.  But I paid for what I got....inexpensive.</li>
    <li> The chain links on this necklace look way smaller in the seller&#x27;s pic.&lt;br /&gt;I doubt I&#x27;ll ever wear this lunky, cheap looking necklace.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t get over it looking like a Run DMC gangsta chain.</li>
    <li> I wanted to believe it would be cute but it really looks like garbage. no exaggeration looks like something you get from party city. its just crap. also the chain is a little longer than pictured. don&#x27;t buy unless you want to wear a really cheap looking necklace.</li>
