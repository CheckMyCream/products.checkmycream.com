    <li> Very clumpy if you apply too much, and the brush isn&#x27;t great.</li>
    <li> Definitely makes your eyes bolder but does so by clumping your lashes together.  It works well enough if you don&#x27;t mind looking kinda clumpy.</li>
    <li> I have got this mascara from the local store&lt;br /&gt;and it&#x27;s fantastic&lt;br /&gt;I have pretty good lashes myself&lt;br /&gt;+this mascara-gives me the face lashes look&lt;br /&gt;very long and full</li>
    <li> The best... It&#x27;s a bit lumpy but after several applications you can see how well it works. Definitely my favorite mascara inexpensive.</li>
    <li> I am thrilled with this mascara! I cannot believe how long it makes my lashes appear. It doesn&#x27;t smudge all day.</li>
    <li> It was ok mascara.  I thought I would be more impressed with it, especially because of cost.  My 3.00 Rimmel mascara does a better job of lengthening.</li>
    <li> The mascara that does what it actually says it does. Great big lashes well worth it.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with this mascara--my lashes look great!</li>
    <li> I was up and down about buying this mascara for so long. I finally caved in when I saw it on sale at Ulta for only $4.75. I love it! It really is awesome! It&#x27;s my new favorite. The brush design is perfect!</li>
    <li> I like this mascara only problem is that It has a little odor. Like a chemical smell... It is not that bad... I really like the mascara other than that. It really makes your eyes POP! I usually only need one coat each lash and it does the trick! I like full lashes and It once again does the trick!</li>
    <li> I have a system for achieving fairly eye-batting results...here&#x27;s what I do: curl tightly for 20 seconds, then put on &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; mascara, wait for it to dry somewhat, then slap this stuff on. It does add length and volume. Even to somewhat sparse, less-than-fan-like lashes. Your mileage may vary!</li>
    <li> This mascara does not give the length that I hoped-for I&#x27;m going back to my Avon super-shock Max mascara. I&#x27;m used to two coats of mascara giving me super long thick eyelashes. I had to use 4-5 coats on each eye taking pains to make sure it did not clump</li>
    <li> Love this mascara. Makes my lashes look so much longer and fuller!</li>
    <li> I love voluminous mascara, but this is my first time purchasing manga in black.  It goes on amazingly, so well that I went out and bought it in purple too.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS MASCARA!!!! Will order again!!!!</li>
