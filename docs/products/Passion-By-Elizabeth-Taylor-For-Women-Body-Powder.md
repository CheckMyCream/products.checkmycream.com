    <li> Barely enough powder in this product to coat the powder puff.....what a rip off! I can&#x27;t believe that this item has gotten away with the lack of powder. Don&#x27;t waste your money to co ordinate the scent when you use Passion. I use the spray and the lotion but a couple more uses of the powder it will be all gone.</li>
    <li> Ive always love the smell of this powder next time gonna buy the bigger size since this one was the small one.. love this powder overrall</li>
    <li> Best price that I found online.  My mom has worn Passion for years.  I don&#x27;t mind buying it because it smells really good.  It is a timeless sent, very relaxing to the senses.</li>
    <li> Over 25 years of wearing this scent and I still get compliments.</li>
    <li> Nice fragrance, feels great and reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> I have used Passion cologne, body powder and cream for many years and I love having people tell me I smell lovely!</li>
    <li> My review of this dusting powder is based on my Mother&#x27;s liking the product.  I do not use Passion, but my Mother has loved it for year&#x27;s.  Dusting/bath powder in something other than a shaker is not very easy to find so I was very pleased to still be able to find a scent she is fond of in the dusting container with a puff.  The scent is lovely as it always has been, the container at 2.6 ounces is not very big but again, to find dusting powder at all now a days is a plus.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this powder I will be ordering it again and the powder is lavender in color!&lt;br /&gt;What a nice surprise!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my mom, fast delivery, great quality.</li>
    <li> This is my go to body powder. It&#x27;s a compliment to the Passion perfume I wear and helps layers the fragrance. I would highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I would love to reorder this item  plus the perfume  that goes with it  i love the smell</li>
    <li> It smells wonderful.  The puff is kind of flat and useless, though.  I had to buy a fluffy powder puff separately.</li>
    <li> My mother loves this product and it will be a welcomed gift. Item shipped quickly and in perfect condition.  em</li>
