      <li>Perfect size to accommodate&lt;br /&gt;the fleece cushion.</li>
      <li>works great good price would recommend</li>
      <li>Good flannel.  </li>
      <li>Great quality, Great fast shipping!  </li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to order more of these.</li>
      <li>I love these.</li>
      <li>Love these.</li>
      <li>Thankfully my sheets look okay with the tea-stain color on them, but still it was a shock when I saw that.  </li>
      <li>my clients all love them.</li>
      <li>they come out of the wash and dry just perfect.</li>
      <li>Seem to launder fine...</li>
      <li>I accidentally washed a face cradle cover with some light colored sheets and the sheets were ruined.  </li>
      <li>so I think they would fit any face cradle.  </li>
      <li>The first is still holding strong after a year of use!</li>
      <li>I love how soft they are,</li>
      <li>Many compliments from my patients already as they don&#x27;t seem to &amp;#34;pill&amp;#34; as much as many other brands.</li>
      <li>I got the brown covers, washed them on their own once in hot water, and then threw them in with my sheets the next time I did laundry.  </li>
      <li>look nice and not cheap and fit the face cradle</li>
      <li>So far they seem to be durable, and they fit well.</li>
      <li>I wash my sheets and face cradle covers in hot water and air</li>
      <li>They are soft, fit well and seem to wash well.</li>
      <li>It came in a timely manner and exactly as described.  </li>
      <li>These are so nice and soft and I could shoot myself in the foot for not getting this chocolate brown color earlier.  </li>
      <li>These face craddle covers are soft and fit the face craddle very well.</li>
      <li>I really like these face cradle covers.  </li>
      <li>I do a lot of massage and they are very durable.</li>
      <li>I purchased some more, and the color on the chocolate ones ran and stained all my other linens.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve seen face cradle covers that don&#x27;t quite fit properly...leaving very little room for a client to breathe, with huge lines left on the face from the seam, but when positioned properly, I can avoid the seam crease on a client&#x27;s face and there is no issue with the fit to the face cradle, even with a large fleece face rest pad underneath.</li>
      <li>So many people come in with eye makeup (and regular facial makeup) on and it stains my covers.  </li>
      <li>It will end up costing me money to buy new sheets.</li>
      <li>Very soft.  </li>
      <li>The only thing against the product is that I was still seeing lint come off them and onto my sheets for the first two to three washes.  </li>
      <li>I wait until I have a full wash of just chocolate face cradle covers to laundry because they will stain other linens you wash with them.  </li>
      <li>I washed them with those same sheets a few more times, and just washed them with a set of new sheets and there was no color bleed.  </li>
      <li>and they  are soft,  </li>
      <li>Seams have held so far.  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re soft.</li>
      <li>They never loose their shape or elasticity.</li>
      <li>I purchased the white ones, which worked fine until after washing them about 10 times, and then they started to wear thin.  </li>

    <li> I just bought these two weeks ago...washed maybe three times each and today noticed a hole in one of them!</li>
    <li> It came in a timely manner and exactly as described.  It will serve it&#x27;s purpose. I haven&#x27;t used it yet so don&#x27;t know how it will hold up in the wash, but we will see. Overall I like it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen face cradle covers that don&#x27;t quite fit properly...leaving very little room for a client to breathe, with huge lines left on the face from the seam, but when positioned properly, I can avoid the seam crease on a client&#x27;s face and there is no issue with the fit to the face cradle, even with a large fleece face rest pad underneath. Love these. No complaints.</li>
    <li> I love these. I do a lot of massage and they are very durable. they come out of the wash and dry just perfect.I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to order more of these.</li>
    <li> Great quality, Great fast shipping!  I have 2 &amp;#34;sets of 10&amp;#34; now. The first is still holding strong after a year of use!</li>
    <li> The color faded all over my sheets when washed on cold and continues to fade every time I wash them. So unhappy with this purchase.  It will end up costing me money to buy new sheets.</li>
    <li> Soft, durable, fits over fleece pad for face rest and no more stained white covers from chick&#x27;s makeup! Score!</li>
    <li> They are soft, fit well and seem to wash well.</li>
    <li> I purchased the white ones, which worked fine until after washing them about 10 times, and then they started to wear thin.  I purchased some more, and the color on the chocolate ones ran and stained all my other linens.  Do not buy!!!</li>
    <li> What needs to be said. So far they seem to be durable, and they fit well. I love how soft they are, my clients all love them.</li>
    <li> The only thing against the product is that I was still seeing lint come off them and onto my sheets for the first two to three washes.  Otherwise, wonderful product, and I&#x27;d recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> These are the best I&#x27;ve found. The size is perfect. They never loose their shape or elasticity. They&#x27;re soft. They do pill a bit over time, but it&#x27;s hardly noticeable.</li>
    <li> I have been using these face cradle covers for about 1 month and they  are soft,  look nice and not cheap and fit the face cradle I use which is a little larger than some.  These  covers are somewhat adjustable so I think they would fit any face cradle.  I have ordered another pack of 10.  I wait until I have a full wash of just chocolate face cradle covers to laundry because they will stain other linens you wash with them.  I wash my sheets and face cradle covers in hot water and air dry the face cradle covers.  I accidentally washed a face cradle cover with some light colored sheets and the sheets were ruined.  This was my fault not the covers.</li>
    <li> I really like these face cradle covers.  The only word of advice I would give to people who purchase these are to wash them separately several times before including them in a regular load of sheets or ANYTHING else.  I got the brown covers, washed them on their own once in hot water, and then threw them in with my sheets the next time I did laundry.  Thankfully my sheets look okay with the tea-stain color on them, but still it was a shock when I saw that.  I washed them with those same sheets a few more times, and just washed them with a set of new sheets and there was no color bleed.  Also, if you hate pilling, these might bother you, though the shedding is light and fluffy and easy to pick off.</li>
    <li> We had make-up stains on our face cradle covers.&lt;br /&gt;So we switched to chocolate color, and we&#x27;re happy&lt;br /&gt;with the result.  Good flannel.  Perfect size to accommodate&lt;br /&gt;the fleece cushion.</li>
    <li> As an Acupuncturist and Massage Therapist I go through A LOT of face cradle covers.  These are so nice and soft and I could shoot myself in the foot for not getting this chocolate brown color earlier.  So many people come in with eye makeup (and regular facial makeup) on and it stains my covers.  Not a problem with these!  I have washed them several times now and they are holding up quite well.  Many compliments from my patients already as they don&#x27;t seem to &amp;#34;pill&amp;#34; as much as many other brands.</li>
    <li> works great good price would recommend</li>
    <li> Had these about a month. Seem to launder fine...no shrinking.  Seams have held so far.  Very soft.  I would buy again.</li>
    <li> These face craddle covers are soft and fit the face craddle very well. They do not shrink after multiple washings.</li>
