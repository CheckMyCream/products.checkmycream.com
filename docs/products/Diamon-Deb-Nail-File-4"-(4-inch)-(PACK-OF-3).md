      <li>, I have a large one also that I have had for years</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve ordered Diamond Debs in the past and loved them, but these do not file as well, sometimes leaving my nails ragged and rough.  </li>
      <li>I especially like the small size that makes them handy to tuck into a bilfold, purse, or glove box.</li>
      <li>cheap product, bent or missing tips, do not buy</li>
      <li>to nail file since I was in my teens (and I&#x27;m nowhere near my teens now).  </li>
      <li>If you are tired of buying regular nail files that don&#x27;t last long enough for one filing, then get some of these metal Diamon nail files; they are well made, and do a really good job for what they are intended....filing nails.</li>

<ol>
    <li> Great old style nail file.</li>
    <li> Great nail files.  Wish I would have gotten a bigger size, but these are nice.</li>
    <li> Diamond Deb has been my go-to nail file since I was in my teens (and I&#x27;m nowhere near my teens now).  Great quality that last.  This is a great value, so I can share with my teenage daughter, who is now discovering how great they are.  And the multi-pack means that she doesn&#x27;t have to continually take mine!</li>
    <li> just as ordered.  excellent</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted and never had to leave the house to get them.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> They work pretty well for me.  I especially like the small size that makes them handy to tuck into a bilfold, purse, or glove box.</li>
    <li> Finally, a nail file with enough grit on the bade to file your nails in one go. If you are tired of buying regular nail files that don&#x27;t last long enough for one filing, then get some of these metal Diamon nail files; they are well made, and do a really good job for what they are intended....filing nails. I only wish I&#x27;d &amp;#34;found&amp;#34; these nail files years ago.</li>
    <li> Fabulous gentle fit under my nails.  I carry one in my purse and have one in the bathroom.  I can&#x27;t believe drugstores don&#x27;t always carry this brand!</li>
    <li> Had not seen these for years. They are the best files going. I ordered enough to give to friends.ordered the 5 in and the 8in. Great buy</li>
    <li> Used these for years and periodically lose mine to some light fingered person.  I recommend this product for everything from nais to emergency pencil sharpener to screwdriver for eye glasses etc.</li>
    <li> Good service!  I love the size and case it is in.  It is easy to carry in a purse or pocket.  It does a nice job on nails, and doubles as a tool now and again - screw driver, small saw, etc.  Also, a good price!</li>
    <li> cheap product, bent or missing tips, do not buy</li>
    <li> the best nail file ever!!</li>
    <li> i got 3, one for my car, one for work, one for the computer desk!</li>
    <li> These are hard to find items.  Glad Amazon has them.  Bought them for my wife, she uses them every day.  She has always loved this brand of nail files.</li>
    <li> This little thing is great. I lost the one I had for years. I was so glad to find another one or three, I have a large one also that I have had for years but it doesn&#x27;t fit in my wallet very well. They last for ever.</li>
    <li> Would make a good miniseries.</li>
    <li> have had one for years. bought these for gifts. especially for a daughter the kept borrowing mine. really nice to remove earwax.</li>
    <li> This is a brand nail file, I have been looking for years to find it.  Not sure if they are made the same way.  If they are you will never want to use anything else. It&#x27;s the best nail file on the market.</li>
    <li> I bought these locally for years.  Delighted to find them on Amazon.  They are the best nail files I have ever used.  So glad they are the same as I used to use.  Thanks for carrying them!</li>
    <li> I love the size but they slip out of the sleeve all the time. The sleeve was a huge selling point because i don&#x27;t like things in my purse to get scratched up by my nail file (like my sunglasses).</li>
    <li> This a knock-off of the real Diamond Deb files...and a poor one a that.  Note the name:  diamond (no D) Deb).  Caveat Emptor.</li>
    <li> I was a little disappointed with these files.  I&#x27;ve ordered Diamond Debs in the past and loved them, but these do not file as well, sometimes leaving my nails ragged and rough.  They also are quite small, so I found them a bit more challenging to use.  One reviewer suggested the newer files by this company are made in China.  I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s accurate, but they seem lower in quality than my older ones.</li>
    <li> Excellant product and is available in 2 sizes, one for the bathroom and one for travel.</li>
    <li> Best nail file ever!  Have been using this brand for 30 years and won&#x27;t use anything else!  For those of you who don&#x27;t like the feeling of paper/cardboard nail files (they give me the chills), these are the perfect solution!</li>
