    <li> Small bottles, and amazing packing. I love the colors!</li>
    <li> I went polish shopping because my manicures were only lasting 2 days with other popular brands. Even \\&quot;no-chip\\&quot; top coat was a fail. I thought I may as well get a set of a bunch of fun colors if I was going to be repainting the, every other day! I am so thrilled with this purchase because not only do I love all the colors, but my manicure lasts 7 days! So I pick a new color each week now and I it. The polish goes on easy and looks exactly like it does in the bottle. It does have a stronger odor than other polishes but I don&#x27;t find it offensive and it&#x27;s gone by the time my nails dry. Now I want to buy another set in other colors. Happy me.</li>
    <li> These are only 2.8 fl oz so small compared to most nail polishes but very fun variety of colors.  They worked great as part of the party favors for my sister&#x27;s bachelorette party!</li>
    <li> Buying nail polish can be really difficult because you never know what quality you&#x27;ll get but these little guys are just fantastic. I like the variety of color, I just wish my box came with a purple. I would say these don&#x27;t typically chip away easily but I do a lot of dish washing so the water just annihilates the polish on my nails.</li>
    <li> I love tiny bottles of polish. Some super great colors. Goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t bubble or stripe. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Perfect gift for my13 year old daughter.  Whether it&#x27;s one color for all her nails or one color for each nail- huge success!!</li>
    <li> Nice colors, and they come in a nice box.  It will make a great gift for a young adult! Actually, I&#x27;m a thirty something and I&#x27;d love to get this too!</li>
    <li> I got these as a gift for a friend and the packages were a ripoff. I looked like I got a lot more than there actually was but that I could deal with. It&#x27;s the color of the nail polish I wasn&#x27;t pleased with. Out of the 14 colors I got there is only 4 colors I would actually use. The quality is pretty good one coat could probably work out well. Overall this would be great in a different color</li>
    <li> This was given as a gift and the recipient thought the polish was &amp;#34;awesome&amp;#34; and the color selection was &amp;#34;impressive&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> The very excellent deal and I am pleased to deal with you again, and I will recommend my friends to this product.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my 13 year old granddaughters.  Of course they loved it.  The colors are pretty and it&#x27;s in a nice container to store  the polish.</li>
    <li> I had gotten every single one of the nail polishes In great condition! Gotten them in the right time and all the nail polish was there! I just absolutely loved the bright colors! I needed some of the colors that I had bought. And the price for some people are pricey or cheap but for me it was an OK price for $14. I would tell people to buy this product from this seller! And what I noticed was that the caps were white instead of black! It makes them look elegant in a new way! LOVE THIS COLLECTION! 💜</li>
    <li> My child is happy now.</li>
    <li> Perfect present for teen girl</li>
    <li> Very price and item. came in a nice box. the boc you cant really keep together without taking it apart. and the jars are smaller then they look in photo&#x27;s but still good :) got this for my wife and she was super satisfied</li>
    <li> Super cute packaging. I haven&#x27;t used many of the colors but the ones I have used are pretty opaque which is really nice since I only need 1 or two coats to get just as thick as I need. I needed a lot of these basic colors! The nail polish plus brush has this frightening tendency to seem like it&#x27;s going to be really streaky but you just have to let it even itself out for a couple seconds and it looks perfectly fine. I&#x27;m REALLY happy I got this! I love all the colors and it was a steal!</li>
    <li> These polishes are great. I love the colors. One bottle was broken and leaking but I was able to patch it up. Overall I am happy.</li>
    <li> Really smelly, but most are nowadays. I like the variety that it offers, and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Cube arrived in horrible shape. It was dirty and broken. Looked like it had previously been opened. Product was purchased to be given as a gift and couldn&#x27;t be used. No invoice with any info on returns.</li>
    <li> Got these for a bridal shower. Cute small size and decent price, but not exactly quality nail polish. Started chipping the same day</li>
    <li> Cool colors. Fair size bottles for $1 a piece. This is an easy Christmas, birthday, whatever gift, guys.</li>
    <li> we bought a second for her to give as a gift.  Very fun and cute and a great gift idea</li>
    <li> Perishable containers&lt;br /&gt;But the wonderful and distinctive paint containing</li>
    <li> So cute! Can&#x27;t wait to give them ad gifts I know the little girls will love them</li>
    <li> I bought these because I thought they were a cheap price. I have never bought anything from this brand before either but decided to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These nail polishes are small, but I just wanted to have more colors for my collection. The consistency of these polishes, similar to Essie&#x27;s, is amazing for the price. They glide on really well without any clumping. It comes in a nice little box as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the polishes was leaked when I opened the box, so it took a long time for me to open the polish itself because it had hardened around the brush. I read in some reviews that the same thing happened to other people too. When I finally was able to open it, the nail polish was fine. The brushes could be better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the brights set. For this one, I only needed one layer to completely cover the nail. You could do two layers, but I don&#x27;t think it would be necessary. These dry quickly too. These chip a few days after applying it on the nails, but I would say still very good quality for the price and brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be looking out for more E.l.f. brand nail polish colors.</li>
    <li> I was very happy when i got this product!I got the Brights Box.&lt;br /&gt;It was exactly what I expected..I love the colors and its thick polish, no need for 3 or more coats like other  polishes. Love that its a Color and Glitter combo. I love the box it came in. Very convenient to have it on display for my at home salon..I haven&#x27;t been disappointed by any E.l.f products so far. I love everything i have from them. I will be buying the Darker colors very soon to add to my collection.Thank you!</li>
