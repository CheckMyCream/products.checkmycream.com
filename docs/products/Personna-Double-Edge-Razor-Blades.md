<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to keep the edge as long as my old shark blades.</li>
    <li> THESE BLADES ARE REALLY GREAT,  THANK YOU.  RICK</li>
    <li> I am surprised by all the positive reviews.  Your Experience may vary, but these were the dullest blades I have tried so far.  I had 1 day of growth, and after a 3 pass shave it felt like I hadn&#x27;t shaved.  I tried a 4th against the grain pass, and still had some stubble left.  Afterwards my face felt like I had used a belt sander to shave with.  I would say these are ok if you have a thin beard, but if yours is tough or you have sensitive skin, I would stay away.  I like both Astra and Shark Super Chrome better, and they are cheaper.  I am trying the Personna Red now, and so far like them better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a note, these are not the Med Prep that are spoken highly of on forums.</li>
    <li> Personna, as a hairdresser, was the only blade I would use for cutting hair. so buying Personna for my husband&#x27;s safety razor was a no-brainer. It will be a VERY long time before he will need to purchase more.</li>
    <li> Tried them. Work ok. Went with the Feather. You have to use what your face tells you to.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, great razors</li>
    <li> I want to love these blades, but they&#x27;re just not for me. They feel rough on my face in all of my razors. Astra SP blades work better for 33% less money. I only gave 3 stars because they&#x27;re made in USA.    I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re counterfeit, but they are wrapped in plain white paper, rather than the blue printed wrappers they are always depicted in.    Update...tried one more in my old merkur 34c and it worked well.  Found I needed to use a little pressure to get a close shave.  If I put pressure on my face with a Feather or an Astra, it would take a strip of skin off with it...with the Personna a little pressure is the way to go.  No razor burn at all, as would be expected with a little pressure.  Still won&#x27;t be my go to blade since they only work well in one of my razors, but at least I won&#x27;t have to toss them out.</li>
    <li> nice, sharp and stay sharper longer. very good deal for the price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried the feathers, astra, asco and a bunch of other, these work the best for me hands down.  The last 5-6 shaves, seem very smooth.</li>
    <li> Work well with a vintage razor I use.</li>
    <li> Very smooth and close. I feel fresh and smooth after shaving.Very unlike those plastic razors with all those blades. Buy one of those Quality German or Swedish razors for for about 25 to 40 dollars an use these blades then re-experience the feel of a professional shave. My wife and daughter started shaving their legs this way and love the smoothness. Buy a quality shaver from Europe and use these blades and you will not get any scraping or blade shimmy.</li>
    <li> Good razors not as smooth as i would like, but that&#x27;s how the razor reacted with my beard and results my vary on how thin or thick your beard is</li>
    <li> Not quite as good as the last blades I used (which were made in Israel) but these will get the job done.</li>
    <li> I like this product very much!</li>
    <li> Work great haven&#x27;t tried any other razors yet so can&#x27;t compare.</li>
    <li> Best blade I&#x27;ve used at an incredible price.  Made in USA!</li>
    <li> Not getting as many shaves as I wanted. BUT the price is right!!</li>
    <li> These blades are sharp enough to cut yourself, and your beard. It&#x27;s what you want at a pretty good price.</li>
    <li> Fits my Merkur safety razor like a champ! And there are so many!</li>
    <li> The price is great but it hasn&#x27;t seemed as sharp as the Feather Blades. Still, can&#x27;t complain when I&#x27;m shaving for about 2 cents a day.</li>
    <li> I gave Personna three stars. The ones I used were the med prep which probably doesn&#x27;t differ in shave quality from the lab blues. Honestly, in my experience two blades (Kai and Feather) stand above ALL the others including: Astra, Gillette Silver, Derby, and Personna. Kai and Feather are simply much sharper and give a closer, more comfortable shave. Of these Kai is without equal. I know they are the most expensive blades (25%) more than even Feather blades but if you consider the quality of the shave, and shave-life of each blade they are money well spent. Kai blades are very sharp but more forgiving and extremely consistent even over areas of my face which are more difficult either due to terrain or whisker thickness. The sellers say Kai uses a higher gauge of stainless steel than other blades and this is clear just looking at the thickness of the DE blade. No exotic or &amp;#34;special&amp;#34; coatings on the blade just a very high quality precision edge. Cost really isn&#x27;t a factor because if you get seven shaves out of each blade you are spending 5.7 cents a shave. Five shaves per blade is 8 cents a shave.  Do yourself a favor and give them a try; you won&#x27;t go back to the others.  PS: I don&#x27;t have stock or any connection with the company. Driven to write only by my shaving experience.</li>
    <li> These are great razor blades and very affordable.  Close shave and very comfortable.</li>
    <li> A lot of people recommend buying a sampler pack, using each brand of blade, then buying your favorite one and throwing the rest away.  This always struck me as fussy and wasteful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on my experience, I think you are going to cut yourself with any blade you start using.  The flip side of this is that once you&#x27;ve got plenty of experience under your belt, you can use any blade successfully.  The reality is that it&#x27;s not the blade, it&#x27;s your skill with the razor itself.  After several years of safety razor shaving, I cut myself rarely, and when I do it&#x27;s because I was rushing and not paying attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a couple different brands - some vintage Personna blades I got from my Grandma&#x27;s house, and one my supermarket used to carry - and decided to buy this brand based solely on price and that it&#x27;s made in the US.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve got no complaints on quality, the price is excellent, and it&#x27;s made in the USA.  I seem to get about 4-6 weeks out of one blade, shaving 3 to 4 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking at a sampler pack, forget it and just get these.</li>
    <li> Great quality blades. Will last a long time.</li>
    <li> Sharp and steady. Order came on time</li>
    <li> Excellent made in USA quality. I have used the same blade every day all week long and it is still sharp.</li>
    <li> Excellent blade-Need I say more?</li>
    <li> These blades are the best I&#x27;ve found, and I&#x27;ve tried a number of the different blades.  Astra&#x27;s (made in Russia) are a very close second, but with the &amp;#34;Made in USA&amp;#34; Personna&#x27;s, what else is needed?  And in this 100-count package it&#x27;s hard to beat the price.</li>
    <li> Recd. the Person a Razor Blades on 3-15-2015 and am very pleased with them. They came in a unique container with an easy open slot that makes it very easy to get out of the box. When I need more of this item, I will definitely order from Amazon.</li>
    <li> These are anything but sharp. Forget these if you have a tough beard. I will never buy these ever again. A complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> i dont feel the blade is sharp enough plus it dont last long either, but for the price hey cant blame much</li>
    <li> A lot better the the Derby Blade. It is not as good as the Gillette&#x27;s safety razors.</li>
    <li> Good razors great value.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with a double edged razor for years, having tried the Sensor and the later iterations, a Panasonic electric shaver and a Norelco, a Remington, etc. I love shaving with a double edge. Reminds me of my father. And I don&#x27;t spend a fortune on blades. I have tried numerous DE blades including Feather, Derby, Astra, Gillette 7&#x27;O&#x27;Clock and regular, Schick, Wilkinson Sword, Blue Bird, and a few others. These are as good as any and better than most. And they&#x27;re made in America! They&#x27;re very sharp but comfortable to shave with and they have good longevity. They are not packaged in individual dispensers with a slot for disposing of used blades. They are individually wrapped in paper and put in the box so get a blade disposal can for .99 or make one (empty a large can of tomato juice. With a saw cut a narrow slit in it near the top. That&#x27;s your blade disposal can, thanks to the Leisure&#x27;s Guy Guide to Shaving). So don&#x27;t succumb to inferior shaves with pricey blades the size of a skillet. Try these Personna, they&#x27;ll be Personna grata.</li>
    <li> This is a great blade for the money. Very consistent in sharpness and durability. I have used Shark, Feather, Dorco, Astra, Wilkinson, Merkur, and VanDerHagen blades, and these are just a hair less sharp than the Feathers, but last about 3 shaves longer. This is a very forgiving blade that won&#x27;t tear up your face.  These work good in my cheap Micro One travel razor, but Fantastic in my Edwin Jagger 89 that I keep at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, proper shaving prep is just as important. This is a safety razor blade, not a weed whacker. Take a hot shower before shaving, get your beard good and wet with hot water, this softens up your whiskers. You can use a good pre shave oil to soften up the bear even more if you desire. Use good shaving cream or soap. Cremo, TOBS, Poraso, Col. Conk any of these make good shave lather. Apply with a brush to get the whiskers ever softer. Let the weight of the razor do the work, TAKE YOUR TIME. If you hack at your face like you can with a Mach 3, your going to get torn up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always use Personna now. Again, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this razor if you prep and shave correctly.</li>
    <li> I have been using other brands for a few years.  When I saw the old Personna brand appear here at such a reasonable price, I had to buy it.  Well, it is as good as I remember.  Very sharp, substantial, high quality blades.  Excellent performance.  I can highly recommend these for folks who want a quick, no nonsense shave.</li>
    <li> I use these in my Merkur razor. Great shave, and I pay less for 100 of these than I would for three of those multi-blade cartridges!</li>
    <li> Got it with regular shipping in just 2 days...crazy sharp blades. Amazing product.</li>
    <li> This one is a 1 star product nothing more. Not smooth at all. Not close to a close shave. Don&#x27;t waste your time and money.</li>
    <li> From the razors I have tried these are the best. Plus, for the price you change every or every other shave. I tried the Astras and they tore my face up.</li>
    <li> The razors work and you can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
    <li> Very nicely sharp blades and yes these are the Lab Blues without the blue wrapper.</li>
    <li> Shaaaarp and cheap. Love them! Works well for women or men. They go dull quick but they are dirt cheap so who cares!</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted. A good quality American made double edge safety razor blade. It seems brick &amp; mortar stores only sell blades from Vietnam. Not stainless steel &amp; don&#x27;t hold an edge all that well.</li>
    <li> Picked these due to the many great reviews. I gave sensitive skin and haven&#x27;t had any problems. Great razors!</li>
    <li> These work perfectly. Bought it for my brother to do touch ups now and then and they are reaaaaaallllllyyy sharp and thin, I love. They get the job done, plus for the amount offered, you can&#x27;t go wrong. Great buy!</li>
    <li> Very sharp blades that hold their edge shave after shave. They are nicely packaged and made right here in the USA.</li>
    <li> Five star blades, just wish the package was different. Here are the blades I have used ranked from best to worst:&lt;br /&gt;Personna&lt;br /&gt;Feather&lt;br /&gt;Shark&lt;br /&gt;Derby&lt;br /&gt;Wilkinson Sword&lt;br /&gt;The Personna give a close, smoth shave. And like I said, I got a small box of 100 blades, and wish they were packaged in the 5 blade dispencer like most other companies.</li>
    <li> These blades are very good. Currently changing them once a week--very sharp. Excellent value for money. They are working as designed.</li>
    <li> The first blade out of the package seemed to dull quickly, but the second one is still going strong. I shave every other day so a blade lasts me a while, especially during these winter months when I&#x27;m just clearing the Nordic neck beard and leaving the rest.</li>
    <li> sharp&lt;br /&gt;have been using them everyday&lt;br /&gt;since i dont use the razor more then once. they are more than adequate.&lt;br /&gt;what they do need is a good safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;i had a cheapo one before i bought the merker futur, and the shave quality is better.&lt;br /&gt;more chances of cut with cheapo ones.</li>
    <li> Sharp blades, but not like feather where they cut you when you look at them.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of blades and these are tops. Sharp, smooth, and great value and made in the USA!</li>
    <li> Best blades. Do your research you will see its a great choice. I am buying more now so I don&#x27;t run out. Live In south east Asia most of year so but highest quality stuff while on my USA visits..  Good price for quality.</li>
    <li> Pretty good bades. They hold an edge for multiple shaves. The Featherlite blades may be a little better, but they ship from China.</li>
    <li> I tried them and shaved my head. They freaking suck for that. Do not get these if your using them for shaving your dome. Maybe it works better on your face but on your head never again.</li>
    <li> I get 6 shaves out of each blade but I do have a pretty light beard. Great buy!!</li>
    <li> I had forgotten how close a shave you can get with a double edge razor  These personna  blades are excellent.  Since going back to a double edge, I had tried Gillette and was disappointed with the quality.  I found out that Gillette doesn&#x27;t make the double edge blades anymore.  They are made in Russia for Gillette.  Try &#x27;em, you&#x27;ll like &#x27;em.</li>
    <li> I can get 3 great shaves and 3 close to great shaves out of these - which is about the best I have ever done even with much more expensive blades.&lt;br /&gt;These don&#x27;t come in safety packaging just a cardboard box with each blade wrapped in a paper envelope. Be careful if you have kids. You also have to come up with a means of disposal if you don;t have an old school medicine cabinet with a blade slot in the back.</li>
    <li> Great blades. These are the &amp;#34;blue labs&amp;#34; and made in USA! Many comments regarding white wrappers and not being real but fakes.....not remotely true. Personna wraps these now in white wrappers to keep costs down. Same great blades as previous batches. Best blade value for 100 count on the market. Do your research before making such comments. If you don&#x27;t want them.....send them to me!! Go buy overrated and dangerously sharp Feathers for twice as much. I will use US made Personnas for the rest of my life!!</li>
    <li> does the job for a cheap price.</li>
    <li> fit my Merkur DE razor great and give a very smooth and clean cut</li>
    <li> Product arrived fast and as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You and Happy New Year!!</li>
    <li> Nice blades. close shave, would purchase again.</li>
    <li> thank you,I received my order</li>
    <li> Sharp.  Cheap.  Anything else I say is parsley on a steak.</li>
    <li> So much cheaper than buying Mach 3 razor blades.</li>
    <li> I hope it is better than the other piece of s*** razor,the twist lock lasted three months,the micro touch one.But what can you expect out of a Chinese made.</li>
    <li> Good quality blades at a price anyone can afford.</li>
    <li> I have almost no facial hair, sadly, and this package will last me for maybe 3 years so what can I say? This is the best deal I&#x27;ve gotten all year on anything this year.</li>
    <li> came as described, fast deliveryc</li>
    <li> Cheap and Sharp; they cut clean and seem to last through at least 4-6 shaves.  I find they snag less than the German blades I have tried.</li>
    <li> At $.14 each, these blades are much, much cheaper than buying cartridge refills for modern 4 or 5 blade razors, and the more blades they add, the less consistent the quality of the blades becomes. After a couple of years of trying electric razors to combat the cost and dubious quality of other refills, I gave up - I got worse razor burn from the electrics than from a dull disposable razor. So I decided to give old school a try, and picked up a Merkur 1904, and a pack of these. So far, I&#x27;ve been very pleased with the combination. A single pass does a great job, little or no razor burn, and it the cost doesn&#x27;t even compare, so I couldn&#x27;t be happier. Top it all off with the fact these are made in the US, and it just doesn&#x27;t get any better.</li>
    <li> Work as advertised but not as smooth as others.  But great value for the price.  Other blades I was able to use the whole week without changing, I find myself changing these every 2-3 days to avoid irritation and an overall rough shave.</li>
    <li> I use the straight razor , and I only get two good uses out of one blade. That&#x27;s not good at all ,,,unless they are a one time use only ? Got to switch</li>
    <li> Good U.S. made blade that works well for me depending on the razor so as with most shaving stuff, have fun experiementing. Just because something doesn&#x27;t work for you doesn&#x27;t mean it is bad. these are just great for me.</li>
    <li> Not as good as the Feather blades for me but a good value nonetheless. Would certainly buy again but reserve the Feathers for a really close shave. I do like the packaging and the ease of unwrapping a new blade.</li>
    <li> Pull way too much and had to buy stock in the Styptic pen company.</li>
    <li> Great blades that last a very long time. Have not had any issues with these and was very pleased. Will order again.</li>
    <li> Good quality razor blade, but a bit too sharp for me as i&#x27;m getting razor burn when using with my Parker 24C razor. But i have noticed a very consistent quality. It may be better when used with a more milder razor.</li>
    <li> Amazing blades. I have been using these now for several months and still haven&#x27;t put a dent in the whole package. They are sharp and of excellent quality. If anyone puts a bad review for these then they must be smoking something.</li>
    <li> Excellent blades. Fit my old safety razor fron the sixties perfectly.</li>
    <li> I bought these because they were made in the USA.  Once I used them I was really impressed on how much better they were than the other brand I was using.  I will buy them again and strongly recommend them.</li>
    <li> Great blades, switched from gilette silver blues to these and got a closer less pulling shave but I also switched creams as well. C.O. Bigalow awesome stuff. Happy Shaving</li>
    <li> The shaving market is a money-making scam. Go back old-style and use a safety razor with these Persona blades. You&#x27;ll save a ton of money, get a better shave, and feel like a real man...not one of those pampered, manicured, powdered up boys who use throw-away blade cartridges that cost more than a tank of gas.  These blades work great for a close shave. You can use a blade for a couple of shaves, throw it away and start a fresh one, and still save your dollars for something you would rather spend your money on.</li>
    <li> When the chips are down, you need a razor blade that delivers. These are beautifully sharp, last me up to two weeks each, and are very cost-effective.</li>
    <li> Very good blades. Easy to snap in half but be careful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for a while now, nice to not be throwing plastic disposables in the land fill.</li>
    <li> Great price exceptional blades</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a trial and error process to see which blades you prefer, but try them and see if you think they worthy of rating i gave. it a great value for the price.</li>
    <li> Are you ready for a Barbershop shave? Ordered these with the Parker 99R safety razor and it&#x27;s a great match. Haven&#x27;t used this combo for 20+ years but it&#x27;s Deja Vu all over again. I&#x27;ve really forgotten what a close shave feels like without the multiple swipes and excessive pressure required for the &amp;#34;modern&amp;#34; multi-blades.</li>
    <li> These blades are dull. Will not be able to use them for the purpose intended.</li>
    <li> These blades are great.  You would think that since they are cheaper than competitors, that they are of poorer quality, but NOPE.  These are better than Merkur blades and for a fraction of the price.  The shave is comfortable and close without nicking or causing any razor burn.</li>
    <li> yep you shave with them. works good</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like these compared to the Derby brand I prefer. I tried to &amp;#34;buy American made&amp;#34; but I can&#x27;t say the quality is there!</li>
    <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t beat these. I tend to shave 3 or 4 times a week and I get about 1.5 to 2 weeks out of each blade. Since there are so many I don&#x27;t mind changing them every few shaves if I feel like it.</li>
    <li> Good price and made in the USA. Better than buying cartridges.  My nephew is getting a safety razor and a box of these razors for Christmas.</li>
    <li> These are some of the best blades that I have ever used.  Very sharp and reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> Wonderful blades. Good packaging. I have heard there are better ones out there but, I have yet to find them.  I am prone to razor burn on my neck and have not had any since using these. Paired with a Gillette SuperSpeed it is truly the best shave I have had in twenty five years. I will be buying again.    As with any safety razor/blade combo your mileage may vary.</li>
    <li> These are very sharp and work great. I would definitely purchase them again.</li>
    <li> I bought these razor blades to replace the Derby blades I had been using for over a year.  Prior to the Derby blades, I used a Gillette Mach 3 razor.  I have a very coarse and fast-growing beard, and noticed the Derby blades would tug quite a bit.  I never gave it much thought because I assumed all blades were similar.  Sufficed to say, I was wrong.  After researching razor blades for a about a week, I settled on the Personnas. The first thing I noticed was how sharp they are compared to the Derby blades.  I no longer feel the razor pulling or tugging at my beard.  The Personna blades glide through my beard with almost no resistance, and leave my face very smooth in just one pass.  These blades are also very forgiving, despite being so sharp.  To me, they are noticeably sharper than the Derby razor blades, but just as forgiving.  Finally, I feel the price is fair for the quality of shave I get and longevity of the blades.  With the Derbys, I could go 3 shaves before having to replace the blade. With the Personna blades, I can go 5 shave before I notice a degradation in the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When comparing the Derby blades to these Personna Blades, I see it like this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sharpness&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Derby  5/10&lt;br /&gt;Personna  8/10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality of shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Derby  7/10&lt;br /&gt;Personna  9/10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price/Value&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Derby  10/10&lt;br /&gt;Personna  8/10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All things considered, I would definitely recommend these razor blades to anyone looking for a sharp blade and comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> Great blades. As someone with extremely sensitive skin who is trying to get a very close shave around my neck/chin line, these blades provide the best of both worlds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use them with the cheapest possible shaving cream I can find, and have incredible results each time. They are very comfortable, yet very sharp blades. The first few times with them I had a few nicks here and there, but I didn&#x27;t feel any of them. It was just a matter of changing the angle slightly and boom, best shave of my life. Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> These are the perfect cost for shaving quality over a long period of time.</li>
    <li> Excellent blade. I have tried a few different blades over the years, but these are my favorite and probably won&#x27;t try any more.  These blades have everything, they are sharp, smooth, and long lasting. I guess that&#x27;s the quality you get when you but American made products.  At 100 blades for around 15 bucks they are not expensive compared to merkur and others.  My old blades I could get 2 maybe 3 shaves out of a blade, but these I easily get 4 to 5 shaves. I shave twice, flip the blade over and another 2 to 3 times.  For me the shaves actually get smoother after the first shave with the blade once it gets a slight dull to it.  I use an Edwin  Jagger razor, and various different soaps.  Support American manufacturing and get an excellent razor. Sharp yet smooth and forgiving, won&#x27;t butcher your face like some of the feather style blades.</li>
    <li> Received quickly  Very pleased</li>
    <li> The blades stay sharp, I usually get five or more shaves before I change the blade, very high quality blades. I went back to a double edge blade because I was tired of being ripped off paying for multi blade shavers.</li>
    <li> Give up the disposable razors and buy an inexpensive razor which will use these economical, double-edge razor blades!  Inexpensive, quality solution to everyday shaving needs. My husband shaves with these everyday and has zero complaints. I like that that come in this larger, individually packaged quantity and that now we always have a razor blade on hand for other tasks:  removing stickers from windows, for example!</li>
    <li> These blades seem to give a good shave the first time but quickly lost their edge after the first use. I even towel dry and clean them across fabric everytime but they still wear quicker than the merkur sample blade that came with my razor handle. I&#x27;ll probably go with different blades when these run out.</li>
    <li> 10$ for 100 razors. 5 stars! I have feather razors as well, I see no difference.... however I&#x27;m not a lumberjack.</li>
    <li> Not my regular blade but they work wonderfully in my open comb and travel razors.  The packaging is handy and they are a great price.  I get 2 comfortable shaves per blade . YMMV</li>
    <li> This is the third brand of double edge (DE) razors that I&#x27;ve tried.  The box itself is pretty small and the razors are individually wrapped and placed inside.  Like the stock photos show, you remove  piece of the cardboard out of the bottom to dispense the razors.  It shouldn&#x27;t take up that much room in a bathroom drawer or medicine cabinet.  They&#x27;re not as sharp as the Feathers that I&#x27;ve tried, but they&#x27;re a lot more forgiven.  They got the job done and are perfect for my needs.  If you&#x27;re looking for a double edge razor, I recommend these.  However if you&#x27;re new to DE shaving, I&#x27;d suggest getting a sample pack to see what works best for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like:&lt;br /&gt;• Made in the USA.&lt;br /&gt;• Shaving experience.  No cuts, sharp and not overlay aggressive.&lt;br /&gt;• Small packaging fits just about anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;* Price.  Box of 100 will last a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like:&lt;br /&gt; • That I wasn&#x27;t supporting a US company earlier in my DE shaving endeavors.</li>
    <li> Excellent DE blade. Gives a great shave.</li>
    <li> Old-fashioned double-edge razor blades work just fine at about 1/10 the cost of fancy, modern, multi-blade products.  If you always shave after a shower when your beard is soft as I do, you can&#x27;t tell the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hesitate to claim a certain number of shaves per blade, because it is so subjective.  We humans are very suggestible - you will tend to get the number of shaves you expect.  That said, it still felt fine after 7 shaves.  But I will probably go ahead and replace the blade once a week anyway -- at 16 cents per blade there is no reason to push it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I deducted one star is that the inexpensive packaging provides no good way to dispose of used blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To answer another reviewer&#x27;s question, I counted 102 blades in the box.  They probably load them by weight rather than by count.</li>
    <li> i have nothing bad to say about these blade made in america win.</li>
    <li> Great shave-and I can already see the savings.</li>
    <li> Remember the story of Goldilocks? Only the little bear had the most suitable stuff for her. Well in the world of razor blades there is also a little bear and it&#x27;s called Personna. Not too dull and not too sharp - it&#x27;s just right. There is one catch... this blade needs to be matched with an open combed razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever since I used these razors with the Fatip Grande razor, I not only got a comfortable shave, but it&#x27;s really fast as well. I never thought I&#x27;d say this, but I look forward to shaving in the morning with this system combination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The secret sauce with this blade is it&#x27;s slightly more narrow then other blades while being sharp. I hope Personna doesn&#x27;t change this design because it works great with open combed razors which tend to expose the blade a lot more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the link to order the Fatip Grande:&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Fatip-Grande-Double-Safety-Razor/dp/B00GSSREEI/ref&#x3D;cm_cr-mr-title</li>
    <li> So I got these after reading reviews and articles online about them and they are nowhere near as good as I anticipated. I have a heavy beard and it pulls when I shave. They do shave nice after a few passes however the pull is not fun to shave through.</li>
    <li> Very nice sharp razors.  Shaving is much smoother.  Nicks, however, can happen more easily for the careless.  If you are new in using a double blade razor, go with Derby, not these.  If you know what you are doing, these are pretty darn good.</li>
    <li> My husband won&#x27;t need to buy any blades for quite a while.</li>
    <li> I use these to shave my head. Much better than the astra platinums i had bought.</li>
    <li> These blades are sharp and work very well. Compared to cheaper blades often included with safety razors, such as Dorco or Derby, Personna blades definitely seem to cut better. They might not be as sharp as Feather blades (I haven&#x27;t tried Feather myself), but they certainly cost less. Given how sharp and reliable these blades are for their cost, I think Personna delivers superb value.</li>
    <li> Very sharp. Haven&#x27;t run out yet more than a year later. Does a great job. Cannot recommend shaving old school more. Saves money and the environment and feels badass.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! I am able to get three, sometimes four shaves from one blade. It isn&#x27;t thick, but my beard grows rather quickly so I have to shave daily. These have already paid for themselves in the disposable razors I used to buy.</li>
    <li> Short and sweet review: the Feathers are too aggressive for my skin type. These Personna \\&quot;blues\\&quot; are perfect! No irritation, last 1 week per blade, and a box will almost cover 2 years!</li>
    <li> These are the same blades as the famous Personna Med blades but in a different box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made in the USA. Very smooth. Very Sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried these with a 1950&#x27;s Gillette Tech razor and Proraso shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BBS (baby butt smooth) shave first time!</li>
    <li> These razors are great and for a great price. I use them with my Dovo straight blade and basically get 200 razors for next to nothing. They are so inexpensive compared to the Gillette razors that I was using. Initially I was giving myself a few nicks but haven&#x27;t in a while now.</li>
    <li> They get the job done for me. Need more practice, but still getting the smoothest shaves I&#x27;ve ever gotten. Takes me 3 passes. Once with the grain, once against, and once perpendicular to the grain.</li>
    <li> You will cut yourself with these blades. Not satisfied at all.</li>
    <li> Use these in my safety razor and my girlfriends layering knife for hair cutting - lasts long works great.</li>
    <li> My Merkur 33c was affordable and high quality.  I may just keep that one, might move up depending on a few factors.  However, the Merkur blade that came with it (one blade) did a clean shave of my two day growth, but (after proper prep of my face and use of pre-shave oil) I felt like there was a lot of pull on the whiskers.  It certainly wasn&#x27;t the experience I expected after doing so much reading on DE shaving.  I did a lot of reading leading up to my purchase of the handle and felt like the reviews of the Personna and the cost per blade made it well worth trying.  It was indeed.  After two shaves with the Merkur blade, I switched to the Personna and it was a world of difference  Smooth with no pull....comfortable and clean.  I will probably try other blades just to experiment...even trying the Feathers.  But for the cost, their effectiveness on MY face...these blades are an excellent value.  That they&#x27;re made here...bonus.  If I&#x27;d had more experience with more blades, this could possibly be a 5 star review.  But to me, that&#x27;s not completely honest.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to know if these are standard blades- I bought the Merkur Razor and&lt;br /&gt;these blades for it. They cut,but was expecting much sharper. I don&#x27;t know if&lt;br /&gt;it is the blades or razor?</li>
    <li> I have tried all kinds of blades over the past decade and, at long last, I have found a blade that gives a great shave and is durable enough to give me that shave for several days.  These will be my blade of choice going forward.</li>
    <li> BLADES DO NOT WORK IN MERKUR LONG HANDLE SAFETY RAZOR I BOUGHT. THEY SHOW THEM ON THE PAGE BUT BLADES DON&#x27;T TOUCH YOUR SKIN, TOO SMALL. THE BLADE THAT CAME WITH RAZOR WORKED FINE.</li>
    <li> SHARP BLADES, GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> I just finished a pack of Wilkinson Swords. Solid blade ,fairly forgiving. I&#x60;m a newbie to safety razor shaving (only a few months) and I am loving it. These Persona blades are sharp. I changed out a three shave Sword for one of these blades and my face was like glass. No nicks, no burn. Finished it off with witch hazel. I recommend this blade especially at this price.</li>
    <li> These work much better than the normal store razors like gillette and stuff I used to get. My skin looks and feels better, and it&#x27;s cheaper, too.</li>
    <li> My husband uses these and they work well.</li>
    <li> Got back into using a safety razor and these are a great value. Each blade lasts me about 5 -6 shaves and is very comfortable.  Would recommend!</li>
    <li> These blades seem to work very well, better than the Feather Hi-Stainless Double Edge blades. I use them with my Feather razor. The blades appear to be a bit &amp;#34;thicker&amp;#34; than the Feather DE and a bit less aggressive. This makes for a much more comfortable shave with pretty much zero nicks or cuts. There is also zero irritation or &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; after the shave. In comparison, the Feathers seemed to be sharper but more aggressive; as a result the Feather blades resulted in more nicks and cuts and led to a bit of an after-shave &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34;. I also find that the Personna blades allow me to shave faster than the Feathers, almost as fast I would with my Fusion cartridge razor - I never felt that I would cut myself even if I went really fast. Lastly, the blades are super-chear, much less expensive than the Feathers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used them for about half dozen shaves so far and the experience has been very good. I will update any new findings as I use them more.</li>
    <li> It all depends on how you shave, but I didn&#x27;t have any resistance with shaving. Make sure you invest in some good after shave!</li>
    <li> These blades were just too dull for me. I&#x27;ve been using Gilette Blue/Silver and Astra blades which I find to be sharp and comfortable. The Personna blades pull on my hair every time.</li>
    <li> This blade does not work for me. I had been using Dollar Generals DE blades but wanted to try these, based on reviews. However the Persona blades did not give as close a shave and left several nicks. Some people might say that the Persona blade is just more aggressive, but considering the stumble left behind I would say they are poor quality at best.  I am disappointed, because I try to buy American when I can.</li>
    <li> I bought these to go with my Edwin Jagger DE89Lbl. As with all blades, you should try a sampler pack before committing to purchasing a large quantity. These ones worked perfectly on my face. Very smooth, a nice cut, and a good price.</li>
    <li> i am please with my ordes ,and the time delivery ,thanks</li>
    <li> These razors were came exactly as described. They provide a good shave, and I would purchase them again. I am still experimenting, and will try a few other brands. The only draw back is that they don&#x27;t come in small cases so disposing of used blades requires more work.</li>
    <li> Great product, they don&#x27;t rust, and you can get the big box from Amazon. They are disposable however even with a thick beard I can get at least four shaves out of each blade. Also after searching my local store I found for the price Amazon couldn&#x27;t be touched.</li>
    <li> Overall a great purchase in my opinion.  This is the first set of safety razors I have bought and am very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> Persona blades - a real shave.  I love the shave I get with these.  I am 84 and the disposable razors don&#x27;t give me nearly as clean a shave as the good old double edge razor.  I only wish the two sides were marked more clearly.  My dad taught me to turn the blade over between shaves and to alternate the edges between strokes during the shave.  He said the edge doesn&#x27;t wear away but tends to curl.  I always did it that way before succumbing to the laziness of the throw aways.</li>
    <li> This is easily going to give you a week&#x27;s worth of shave.  So count on 5-7 good shaves with this blade, which is admirable considering some brands don&#x27;t last as long.&lt;br /&gt;Apparently with any blade YMMV, yet so many people have had good luck with this that it&#x27;s worth a try to see how it works for you.</li>
    <li> Good product but could be a little sharper.</li>
    <li> I like having American made blades to use. However, the Feather blades are sharper and seem to last longer even with my light beard. The Feather blades require extreme caution as it is easy to nick yourself or perhaps it is my razor. who knows? Nevertheless I will buy both types of blades depending on how &amp;#34;close&amp;#34; I may need to shave.</li>
    <li> I decent shave and got lots of blades to boot.</li>
    <li> Tried tons of blades: Astra, Rapira, Lada, Voskhod, Derby, Feather, Dorco, etc. Feather are the sharpest, but Personna are the absolute best in terms of price/quality. They are almost as sharp as the Feathers, but three times cheaper. Astra are very good too, but milder--I recommend them to beginners. Being extremely sharp, Feather and Personna can result in an unpleasing shaving experience unless one knows how to use them. Pretty much the same applies to razors: the milder ones seem to be smoother before one learns how to use the more aggressive razors, which can be smooth and much more efficient than the milder razors if one knows how to use them. Like aggressive razor, Personna take a bit of practice. I was unhappy with them at the beginning: I got lots of weepers when I first tried them, and avoided them for a couple of months. If the angle is not right, they can easily cut at the root of hairs. After 5 months of DE shaving I use them in aggressive razors, with superb results. Although, as I said, Astra are also great, I just can&#x27;t get with them a shave as close as the shave I get with Personna.</li>
    <li> Not as good as the Merkur blade that came with my DE shaver but does the job</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work well for me. Im not saying its a bad.blade, Im staying with Feather, that blade works for me.</li>
    <li> Great value, and a smooth shave.</li>
    <li> Some Japanese blades are ridiculously sharp, but are very easy to injure. Some have the edge of an opened lid from a can of beans. Personna blades are the perfect combination of speed and comfort. Great price for a great shave!</li>
    <li> Works great for the price, would buy again. Changed my life and how I live it.</li>
    <li> Good blades and lots of them- I&#x27;m so glad we still make them in the USA</li>
    <li> Perfect for my head, did not work well for my face.</li>
    <li> Very good product at a terrific price. Why use 3, 4 or 5 expensive blades when 1 will do the job several times at far less cost!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I hate wasting money on expensive cartridge blades only to get a few shaves, it&#x27;s like throwing money away!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I shave every day for a week with one blade, something I can&#x27;t do with a cartridge.</li>
    <li> I use these blades in a Merkur 34C and they work great especially for beginners like me. Even though they&#x27;re not as sharp as other blades they&#x27;re still comfortable and if using proper technique it&#x27;s unlikely that they&#x27;ll nick you. I have dense whiskers and sensitive skin and so far DE shaving with these blades are the best method of shaving I&#x27;ve tried. No more razor bumps and regular nicks that the cartridge razors gave me, and not irritating like electric shaving.</li>
    <li> Very sharp, but why does it bleed when you use it?</li>
    <li> best for the money,  only one made in the USA</li>
    <li> I like that they are about 20 times cheaper than the blade cartridges I was getting from the grocery store.</li>
    <li> Blades don&#x27;t last very long when shaving. I get better life from the blades I bought at Walmart. With getting 100 blades at this price it&#x27;s an OK deal if you don&#x27;t mind changing blades after every other shave.</li>
    <li> WARNING: DOUBLE BLADES IN WRAPPER. These are decent razor blades, but I caution you that if you get a blade that just doesn&#x27;t seem right, remove the blade from razor and firmly hold blade on flat sides and slide the 2 blades apart. Since these blades are lightly coated with oil, they will stick together tightly. I can now tell if there are double pack or single packed blades. If the paper wrapped blade feels floppy when flexed, it&#x27;s a single pack. If it is firm, then it&#x27;s a double. This has happened twice out of the first 3 wrapped packs. I have checked many others in the 100 pack. This is not a rare occurance.  I have twice shaved with this doubled up blade without realizing it until after the shave was complete. I got a decent shave each time, but I had to work for it.  It was after my most recent shave that I checked the box for flexible and firm wrapped blades.  I&#x27;ll be double checking from now on.  I must report that unlike others that seem to be obsessed with the price of double edge safety razor blades, I am more interested in a burn free, irritation free shave.  I have never spent so much money on shaving since I switched to a double edged razor. First, I bought a Edwin Jagger, then a Merkur, then a Feather popular, then another Edwin Jagger. I, thankfully, already had a Plisson badger brush.  Then there are the assortment of shave creams, pre-shave oils, after shave balms, well you get the idea.  On the other hand, I am pleased that I can now shave everyday without irritation and I enjoy the process. I used to shave about twice a week, and dreaded shaving.</li>
    <li> As much as I like enjoying small businesses after paying an arm and a leg for the razor blades sold by Lehman&#x27;s (it&#x27;s the shipping cost that really kills you)  I was SO happy to find these. They fit the German made &amp;#34;Traditional Safety Razor&amp;#34; I purchased on Lehmans.com (Item #30601) perfectly and come in completely plastic free packaging. I places them in a jar because the box fells apart and keep it in my cabinet, once my razor gets dull I just change it out. Both me and my wife share our razor (Yes! We wash it between uses, geesh!!) so these little blades take on facial hair, leg hair, and under arms. I can think of some women who would be too picky to be satisfied with the closeness of these shaves and you have to be a bit more careful then with a common disposable but I am content with using these. My razor and blades has long paid for itself and this is a much more echo-savvy choice.</li>
    <li> As there is no one size fits all &#x27;perfect&#x27; blade, the same as for a razor, because each persons face and beard texture are unique to them.  Add in shave perperation or lack of it, and technique regarding the care taken and pressure applied and the variables will then play out to provide either a great shave or one that cuts and iritates the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is why reviews vary so much - with that in mind all I can say is my experience with Personna blades have been very good, for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My razor - Edwin Jagger DE98L&lt;br /&gt;Soap - Col. Conk Glycerin base&lt;br /&gt;Blades Used to compare - Derby and Personna&lt;br /&gt;My bearded texture - coarse&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personna blades for me were sharper and provided a shave that &#x27;tugged&#x27; less than Derby.  I had to work less at shaving as the Personna blade did more of the work.  I did have to adjust my poor technique of pressing the razor to my face and as I have found and heard many say &amp;#34;if you have to press in on the razor, the blade for your beard texture is not sharp enough&amp;#34;.  For me, if I do not use a light touch, indeed I will nick myself or have a lot if razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I have learned to use a lighter touch with a sharper blade the shave is rated DGS to BBS, no nicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A quick note on shave soaps or gels - it is not how thick, but how slick you have it applied on your face.  If to dry, you&#x27;ll cry is a good phrase to remember.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy shaving, long live DE shaving</li>
    <li> My husband likes them because of their reputation and quality.</li>
    <li> Very sharp, no glue on the blades, and a very satisfying shave. Each blade is good for a few shaves (flip it over for maximum use) and a strong reason to quit spending a lot of money on multi-blade expensive heads and go back to the good old double-edge single-blade razors that last forever.</li>
    <li> Have been using them for some time. Great value for the price.&lt;br /&gt;I have a tough beard so each blade does not last beyond 2 shaves but at this price, you can use and throw one after every shave.&lt;br /&gt;Most blades hold their edge well. Have at times had a dull blade but that is far and few in between.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend these if you like to shave with double edge razors.</li>
    <li> The blades shave close and clean and with the right razor are completely safe.  Each blade lasts 3-5 shaves.  At $13 for 100 blades and compared to Gillette MACH III ($15 for 3 blades) the savings is about $700 a year.  The blades come in a convenient dispenser box so you can&#x27;t spill them.  The shipping was very fast.</li>
    <li> I was looking for razors to use to shave. These are razors. There are 100 of them, and they are the cheapest I could find.</li>
    <li> I tried these for the first time and I can say they were not for me. The blade felt dull and rough on my face. I have used Feather DE blades in the past and I thought I  would try these. The Feather blades are SMOOTH in terms of the shave. I have used a Feather blade multiple times and have never felt the rough sensation as I did with the Personna  DE blade. The difference in the two blades is amazing. I&#x27;ll stay with Feather for sure.</li>
    <li> These are pretty nice.  Cuts nicer than a derby (which is a brand I like a lot) and almost as well as a feather.  Does not cut as well as my personna 74&#x27;s  but hell those are legendary and they don&#x27;t make them anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other stuff &amp;#60; Derby &amp;#60; This blade &amp;#60; Feather &amp;#60; Personna 74</li>
    <li> So far so good.  I have not used all 100 yet but, razors one and two were both good.  I am pleased with the sharpness and how the blade keeps its edge.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t wait to use them</li>
    <li> Best shave ever. Great price. Tried samples like everybody and choose these lab blues for my goto blade. Try samples to see if they are for you.</li>
    <li> This are the best double razor blades I have ever used. I am relatively new and decided to step up to a better razor and blades. I am so glad that I did. These razors are boss. Smooth glide, sharp edge. Monster cut.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll never go away from single blade, double edge blades.  The double, triple and more blades don&#x27;t give me a close shave like this.  They last longer and are cheaper.  What more can you ask for?</li>
    <li> These razor blades are, in my opinion, some of the best ones out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very sharp, not too sharp, pretty smooth compared to blades as sharp as these... and the price is pretty fair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a very thick bear and lots of it, and also sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;These blades are not harsh on MY skin at least, they are sharp enough to tackle my tough beard (it also depends on the skin prep and Razor you use them with) and they don&#x27;t tug and pull as much as other duller blades out there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, life expectancy of these blades for me? about 3-4 shaves per blade. I tend to throw it out when it tugs a bit to ensure the best shave every time.</li>
    <li> I have switched to Personna after using Feather briefly. I can&#x27;t tell any difference between the two quality-wise (both are excellent) but Personna is cheaper. So, go for it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a black man with no serious bump problems; however these razors did not work for me.  I can only use them once and I have to scrape two or three times to get the job done.  Sorry!</li>
    <li> Nice, it&#x27;s nice to get away from the rip off disposable scene.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving using safety razors for a little over 2 years. I was very excited to try these razors as they are made in America and very reasonably priced.  However,  the feeling excitement quickly wore off and was replaced by the feeling of tugging and pulling instead of actually cutting my facial hair. I am in the military and therefore shave on a daily basis and take shaving very seriously.  I will be going back to higher quality razors (gillette platinum) and throwing 97 of these away.</li>
    <li> Best razor I&#x27;ve used and you get 100 of em so little last you a while</li>
    <li> I have a set of Gilette 7 o&#x27;clock blades and a box of Personna. I tend to get more irritation using the Personna blades.</li>
    <li> What can I say? These blades give a close clean shave and last longer than some of the lesser quality blades sold. I know the name &amp;#34;Personna&amp;#34; and took a chance that these blades would be of high quality... I was NOT disappointed! These blades are GREAT!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with a straight razor for about a year now.  I&#x27;ve used Derby blades, Astra, and now the Personna blades.  These blades have, by far, given me the closest and most comfortable shave.  The Derby/Astra blades aren&#x27;t terrible, but there is more tugging/pulling when I used those  blades and they do not cut the hair as cleanly or closely as the Personna blades do.  After a hot shower and applying a nice lather of shaving soap, these blades just glide through my pretty coarse facial hair.  I&#x27;ll generally use each blade two times before discarding it.  You could definitely get more shaves out of each blade, but at $0.13 per blade, that brings it down to about $0.06 per shave!  I will be using these blades for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these as a FIRST blade for someone new to safety razor shaving, though.  These are the sharpest blades I have used and a new shaver would run a higher risk of cutting themself while getting accustomed to this style of shaving.  If you are new, I would start with Derby blades then progress from there.</li>
    <li> Never look back to modern razors. Easy to use, cheap, convenient, sharp. I am in love with these blades.</li>
    <li> I have used Merkur (Solingen, Germany) and Derby Extra (Turkey) with my Edwin Jagger Razor. I prefer the Merkurs, but both have done a fine job. I wanted to try these Personna blades because they are made in the US. The blades I received were dull, grabbed and pulled whiskers, and left my face raw. After no success with the first couple blades, I pulled a blade from the middle of the package (hoping the problem was confined to the first few blades in the box), but it was the same. After a horrible shave with about five different blades, I threw the box away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have a look at some of the recent 1-star reviews. Many seem to be late spring through summer 2015. I have to think (and hope) that a few of us have received blades from a bad production run. Based on the amount of good reviews, I&#x27;m guessing my experience, and the ones like it are a fluke. Either way, I&#x27;ve since bought a 200-pack of Derby Extras for about the same price as the 100-pack of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love to buy made in USA products, so I&#x27;ll probably try these again. I hope the blades improve.</li>
    <li> A bunch of mediocre razors but they do git&#x27;r done. It&#x27;ll probably take me a year to use them all. I&#x27;ll be switching to another brand when I&#x27;m done. They&#x27;re similar to Dorco and store brand generic blades which also work just fine. Not horrible but also not above average.</li>
    <li> After seeing quite a few people liking thes blades thought I would give them a try.&lt;br /&gt;For me those do not perform nearly as well as Feathers(not fair as these a &amp;#62;2x $), Astras (&amp;#60;$), Gillettes (&amp;#62;$), or even Derby(&amp;#60;$) blades.&lt;br /&gt;Have tried several times in different razors and always end up with razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;But obviously others are having good luck with them.</li>
    <li> ONE OF THE BEST BLADES OUT THERE FOR ME</li>
    <li> They are my first and only DE blades so this is perhaps a biased review. They are working great for me so I cannot expect that I&#x27;d even try any others considering the great price. I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard but I do need to shave every day. These blades are working for me.</li>
    <li> Close to a 10 year supply.  Very sharp, nice clean shave.</li>
    <li> Very good price, but the blades are not the best.  I guess you get what you pay for.  Each blade does not last for many shaves.</li>
    <li> Excellent Shave! And with 100 in the box I can switch out a blade without thinking I&#x27;m dipping into a restricted and expensive lot.</li>
    <li> These have replaced my 7&#x27;oclock yellows as my goto blade. I&#x27;m glade I can buy them on amazon and for a cheap price. Usually blades have the first shave burrs, these don&#x27;t. They&#x27;re smooth from shave one. I&#x27;d highly recommend these. I&#x27;ve been shaving with a DE for 10 years and they&#x27;re the best I&#x27;ve come across of the ten or so blades I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> These blades are just a bit too small when used on the Merkur long handle safety razor and therefore barely touch your skin. End result: you&#x27;re left with a largely unsatisfactory shave, everytime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first shave I used two blades because I couldn&#x27;t believe how terrible the first razor was cutting (but I had 99 more so I wasn&#x27;t too worried). Now each shave I&#x27;ve been using a brand-new blade hoping that the one before was just a bad blade, but it seems the problems not that they&#x27;re not sharp enough. It&#x27;s that these blades are just too small for my safety razor. Not sure if that warrants a one star review because a lot of people seem to have had a great experience with these blades (which is why I bought them) but I want to warn the community. Is there a better place to put this &amp;#34;advice&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was going to try to stick it out with the rest of the blades, but being very unsatisfied after each shave, I&#x27;m investing in either feather blades or merkur blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The merkur blade that came with the long handle was excellent and gave me six worry free shaves (too bad they only give one).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many of the one star reviews on these persona blades highlight the same issue so I just want buyers to be aware.</li>
    <li> a little scratchy on shave one, but perfect on 2.  Pulls a little on 3.  Burns your face off on the 4th.  Not the smoothest razor but plenty sharp at first</li>
    <li> These are fantastic! I have used derby and shark blades but these are far superior. To bad I didn&#x27;t find out about these sooner.</li>
    <li> Great product and delivery time</li>
    <li> These are the second blade I have tried in my shavette, after the Derby blades it came with. Considering the Derby blades are a low end import made in Turkey and are massively better, American Safety Razor should be embarrassed to put &amp;#34;USA&amp;#34; on the Personna box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades are dull, soft, and have an irregular finish, all of which leads to a sore face and a sink full of blood. I am literally sitting here with toilet paper dabbed onto the seven cuts these blades left on my face. These blades are so bad that I can&#x27;t even comment on their value, given that they are worthless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money and your face, but something else.</li>
    <li> Not original product at all I do not recommend this &amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;They are 100%. Made in China .</li>
    <li> These are my preferred blades in my Edward Jagger DE89. I have skin that is more on the sensitive side and these don&#x27;t leave me with razor burn. The Personna blades are good for at least 5 shaves and very sharp without being tricky. They are Made In USA. They are not Feather sharp, but not everyone wants or needs that level of sharpness. Gillette 7 O&#x27;Clocks (green) are my second favorite followed by Astra. Whatever blade you choose, use a good shave cream like Taylors or Old Bond Street or Proraso</li>
    <li> First box of razors I bought after getting into the double edge razor game.  Worked out perfectly.  I switch them out about every 2 weeks and have been amazed with the close shave and the fun experience of using something other then the commercial razors costing 20X the price.</li>
    <li> Researched the item prior to purchasing and found decent reviews, and price. Item  actually turned out to be better than expected.  Would recommend and purchase again.</li>
    <li> These are my first double edge razors and they do the job very well.  My only dislike is they come in a card board box and is you put the old blades in it be careful.</li>
    <li> Great blades would recommend I get about 6 shaves per blade don&#x27;t know if that is considered good or bad but I am satisfied.</li>
    <li> I purchased these along with a Kinbar razor to try out shaving with a safety razor.  I have been very happy with the result and have no complaints with the razor or blades.  These are my first though so I do not know how they might compare to others.  The combination works well, doesn&#x27;t seem to cut too aggressively and I have had no issues changing from cartridge razors.  I will not be switching back !</li>
    <li> These blades are great. I use one about 7 to 10 days. During that time they do give me a shave I&#x27;m happy with. Of course, they shave better on the first 2 days. I really like the way they shave on the 3rd or 4th day, not too harsh, but sharp enough.</li>
    <li> spoiled by double edges</li>
    <li> Best double edge I&#x27;ve used so far. Can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> Tried to save a few dollars and support a US based co, but it came at a cost. First thing I noticed was that these were not getting as close of a shave as my Merkur blades. I figured maybe I just needed another pass or two, but was getting the same results. I also feel the blade life is sub-par. I am able to get 2 shaves out of a blade before basically having to toss it or risk getting nicked. Typically I would get at least 3 close shaves out of the Merkurs. The last straw for me was the face cutting though. I haven&#x27;t cut myself shaving in year&#x27;s, but these blades changed that. My most recent cut was enough to make me recycle my remaining ~80 blades on the spot. Made for a good gag on the wife thinking I cut my throat open though.</li>
    <li> Saved me hundred of dollars by using single blade</li>
    <li> Very happy with razor blades. Thank you</li>
    <li> I have only used these and Van Der Hagen.  Got to give Van Der Hagen a slight edge in shave quality, but for the price I paid for American made Personna blades, it would be tough for me to try another brand.</li>
    <li> Been using for 6 months and I have never had a better shave</li>
    <li> Purchased as recommended to be used with my Merkur Classic Straight Safety Razor. I initially installed the blade in the razor with part of the razor upside down and thought the blade was too small. I realized my mistake, installed the blade properly, and the blades work perfectly.</li>
    <li> Actually exceeded my expectations and so glad they are made in the USA . Used one this morning and found they gave a very smooth shave!</li>
    <li> nice shave. keep away from hipsters.</li>
    <li> I have been using these blades for about 2 months now and I really enjoy them! I recently switched to using a safety razor and I am not looking back. I use a Merkur Long Handled razor and these blades have been incredibly smooth and I have experienced very little irritation with these blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Shave about twice a week and usually have to change these blades every 4-5 shaves. I put baby oil on the blades after drying them off to help preserve them for longer. I know this box of blades will last me a longggg time. Very please with this purchase!</li>
    <li> The product was perfectly packaged, and works well with our Shaveology handle!</li>
    <li> I rate very harshly often and this product IS amazing! Super sharp works amazing and I have a sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I like these better than feather blades because I have sensitive skin and I get little to no razor burn using them. Package came quickly. I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> These are great blades! And still made in the USA! And so are the Derby&#x27;s,Merkur&#x27;s&#x27;ect! I have tried many vintage Gillette razors only to find a couple that worked for me which I still own! One made in1954 and the other in 1959! Bottom line is &amp;#34;It might just be your razer and not the blade&amp;#34; I go with the Merkur brand of razors these days! I own 4 different types and they all do a great job with all types of blades!</li>
    <li> dull when you put them in and useless after one scraping shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wet-shaving for 3+ years, and have tried quite a few brands of blades. I have a pretty light beard, but a fresh Personna blade can barely cut through the a day&#x27;s stubble. I can&#x27;t imagine someone with a thicker beard could use these blades. There is some drag and more often than normal nicking. Turkish Derbys (green packaging) are sharper and comparable in price for the &amp;#34;value minded&amp;#34; wet-shaver. As far as the design of the product goes, I like that the box serves as a blade dispenser, and that each blade does not have glue on it to keep it in the wrapper (some brands, like Derby, have that glue and it can melt when shaving. It&#x27;s not a super big deal, but you have to clean your razor more often).</li>
    <li> This 100-pack will last me for a very long time. Bought this to use with &amp;#34;Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> For the price and shave you really can&#x27;t go wrong. 13.87 per 100 blades !!! Keep these deals coming! These blades work great on my beard they are a tad sharper than my normal blade. Seem to stay sharp just as long. I will keep these in my line up.They are shaper and smoother than the wilkinson sword, not quite as sharp as the Feather. they are my everyday shaver !</li>
    <li> This BLADE GIVES a smooth shave at a great price.Also,made in the USA.I am totally satisfied.Why pay more for another BLADE?</li>
    <li> Nice blades. I like them a lot!</li>
    <li> high quality. will feel like they will last a long time.</li>
    <li> Sharp, well made blades.</li>
    <li> It give me a close shave without giving me razor bumps</li>
    <li> Great value. Blades are very sharp and comfortable.</li>
    <li> Good affordable razor made in the USA. I feel that the German and Japanese razors have a sharper edge, but these get the job done. I like the edge on these razors as I can rush through a shave and not slice myself up. I need to be more careful with the Feather razors.</li>
    <li> I can shave everyday with a brand new razor for 200 days. There is nothing else to say!</li>
    <li> I purchased these based on reviews and I had high expectations for these blades. I get one good shave per blade.  I&#x27;ve tried using them two days in a row but they just don&#x27;t do the job.  I believe the first shave is very nice and lives up to expectations, but I believe I should be able to use the blade more than one time.  My previous blades were good for up to 3 shaves but I generally swapped them out every other day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a connoisseur of razor blades but I find these give an excellent shave and they are made in the U.S.A which is always my preference. For the money you can&#x27;t go wrong. Even if you get them and don&#x27;t like them it&#x27;s not like they are expensive.</li>
    <li> Great price on razor blades that work and are American made.</li>
    <li> great shave and they save you a lot of money over other razors</li>
    <li> You cannot beat this deal/ The blades give serial shaves, and at ~ .13 cents each - you cannot beat the value over less efficient cartridges.</li>
    <li> Product was as described and came quickly.</li>
    <li> Great blades!!! Great shave! I found the best! Customer for life!</li>
    <li> Daaaaaamn!  Women love old school!  I don&#x27;t know why, but they do.  Maybe they think you&#x27;re more thoughtful or something, but when I tell women about it, they love it.  &amp;#34;Hey Miss, I shave old school.&amp;#34;  DTF!</li>
    <li> I love these blades! The price is fantastic and made in the USA to boot!&lt;br /&gt;After paying the high cost of replacement blades for my old Fusion, I went old school, and I&#x27;m glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never had a really great shave until now, and I owe it to, in part to these fine blades.&lt;br /&gt;Two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Sharp as a razor blade.</li>
    <li> Great deal for decent quality razors. They feel just as sharp as any other razor, but they do seem to maintain that sharpness for less time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is still a great deal.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and exact item as described thx. Recommend</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat this price</li>
    <li> Great blades, enough to last me about a year or maybe even more, i really like how they&#x27;re made in the USA. Do recommend,  especially if you&#x27;re a beginner,  they&#x27;re nice and easy on you, and get the job done right even when you have experience with DE razors. Will buy again when I&#x27;m out</li>
    <li> Sharp, forgiving, and reasonably priced. Running these in a Utopia safety razor and I love it.</li>
    <li> Previous to this purchase, I bought a 100 blade variety pack that did not include a  Personna blade.  After trying every blade at least twice, I decided none was very sharp or durable.  Three shaves and a week later, using a Jagger DE89 and a Personna  blade, I can now say that I only make a single pass with the same closeness as I would with an two passes and an Astra Platinum.  I have quite a few 7am&#x27;s that are going to charity.  Ninety-nine blades to go.</li>
    <li> Extremely sharp and made in America - just buy it already!</li>
    <li> Excellent overall blade. Sharp and dependable. I rank them under Feathers but slightly above Astra SP. Plus, they are made in the USA. I plan to buy more in the future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to DE shaving and these are the first blades I&#x27;ve tried with my EJ DE89.  You&#x27;ll find other great reviews on YouTube and Badger and Blade from experienced shavers but for me, these are perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get three good shaves with each blade (3 pass each) on my tough beard. At about 13 cents per blade, these are about the best value out there.  I would recommend to a beginner.</li>
    <li> Dull compared to Feathers and Gillettes. When new, they shave like a Feather blade does on my 4th day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fine for thin hair, but if your beard hairs are thick, these grab and pull like any dull razor would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Thick beard stubble? You need something much sharper. Even Shark blades are sharper.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have too much facial hair and can literally go weeks without switching the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing is I wish I had known about these earlier!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wet shaving for about 3 months. I have a medium beard and had used Doro and Gillette blades. These are the best for me. The other blades required a very attentive touch; get distracted by an upcoming court appearance  at zero dark thirty, and I would appear with serious pieces of my face missing. These give me a close shave but without so much danger. They are reputed to last longer than the sharper blades as well, though I can&#x27;t speak to that yet. Glad I bought a hundred!</li>
    <li> Old school shaving at its finest...I miss the barber using the straight razor on my neck and around the ears, but this is classic and comfortable to use</li>
    <li> I have used about 5-6 of them and seem to do well. I get about 5-6 shaves, no nikcs. Not as sharp as Feather or Sputnik but seem to be a good one for everyday shaving. I tried the red israeli personna and those I felt shave a little better.</li>
    <li> Great razors.  Very similar to a Feather, but more forgiving.</li>
    <li> good razor blades for the money</li>
    <li> These blades jumped over a 2 day growth and pulled no matter which direction I tried. When they skip and drag, they then dig into your face and leave cuts and nicks bleeding. Tried 3 different blades. Do not give a clean shave. These kind of bad purchases leave one quite upset as the trip to UPS ends up costing almost as much in gas as the refund. So you really lose twice. No choice but to trash them and hope to find something that does what the manfacturer says they will do.</li>
    <li> Razors are as advertised. Sharp and do the job. Nothing outstanding but o the price they work fine. Nothing I couldn&#x27;t do without but ok for the price</li>
    <li> I was having trouble finding safety razor blades in store so I decided to try ordering them offline.  I have been using the first blade for over a month now.  It still shaves like new.  This box seems like it will last me a long time.</li>
    <li> Good value, but flimsy blades and no good way to dispose of them. It would be great if it came with a little plastic case to dispose of used blades.</li>
    <li> There is nothing particularly wrong with these blades - they delivered a close shave, but after using Feather blades I was disappointed in the sharpness of the Personna blade.  With Personna blades I can feel the blade drag and pull on my beard - not a comfortable experience.</li>
    <li> These are the sharpest razor blades I have ever purchased. Shaving is much easier as I do not have to continue going over the same area.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t seem as sharp as the Shark blades.  Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I have very coarse, curly hair and sensitive skin. I was using Gillette Mach3 and Fusion for years. I thought I&#x27;d always have to live with nicks and razor burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I switched to the traditional method - shaving cream, shaving brush, and safety razor. The difference was immediately noticeable. The best blade I found was Astra Superior Premium Platinum. It gives me a pretty smooth shave, but I wish it was a bit sharper. I still got nicks and razor burns but considerably less than before. I also tried Feather, which was way too sharp for me, it sliced up my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I ordered Personna Double Edge Razor Blades. It is PERFECT. It is sharp, but it does not chop up my face. At the same time it is smooth and forgiving. No nicks and my neck finally looks normal after years of razor burns.</li>
    <li> Sharp as all hell - the term &amp;#34;razor sharp&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t just a euphemism. I&#x27;m using these in a Merkur Safety Razor (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002A8JO48/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s01?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1) and they work wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each blade comes individually wrapped in it&#x27;s own tiny envelope. To me, that&#x27;s a sure sign of quality craftsmanship and attention to detail. Hint: save the empty envelope for when you&#x27;re done with the blade. It might not be sharp enough anymore for a perfect shave, but it&#x27;s still sharp enough to sever a finger if simply chucked in the trash can. We&#x27;ve all had to look through a trash can for something we shouldn&#x27;t have thrown away, right? Unless you&#x27;ve got one of those old-time slots in your medicine cabinet for used blades (where they just fall into the wall cavity - fun for remodelers), yeah. Be careful. Sharp. Did I mention they&#x27;re sharp?</li>
    <li> Great blades for the price.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re sharp, for sure, but my razor isn&#x27;t  aggressive enough to realize the full benefits of these blades on my tough beard. After I get a more aggressive razor, I&#x27;ll update this review. Good price, though, and well-made and wrapped. A quality product through and through.</li>
    <li> Not as good asfeather blades, but much cheaper.</li>
    <li> So far I like them. Not as sharp as some but do the job well. And what a bargain! They will last me over a year!</li>
    <li> If Gillette is the best a man can get, they obviously haven&#x27;t seen these. You can&#x27;t beat the price and quality. I have thick facial hair and have used a blade for 3 shaves with still getting a close shave, it could probably last longer though. Because of the price, I often spoil myself and use a new blade each shave. Gillette and the Dollar Shave club cannot beat this!</li>
    <li> I just switched from shaving with the expensive cartridges to doing a more traditional wet shave and I absolutely love it. These are the only double edge razor blades I&#x27;ve ever used, but they&#x27;re packaged so that they&#x27;re easy to get to when I&#x27;m replacing blades and I&#x27;ve used one blade for 2 shaves a couple times, and didn&#x27;t really notice any difference, but at this price I figured I&#x27;d just get a nice close clean shave every time with a new blade. Love em!</li>
    <li> very sharp. very cheap. don&#x27;t accidentally run your hand across it though (see the first sentence in the review)</li>
    <li> These blades have been giving me a great shave for years. The 100 pack is a great deal. Shipping was faster than expected. No complaints.</li>
    <li> Sharp and smooth. This and the Derby are great for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Great product and prompt delivery!</li>
    <li> i found them to be less comforting than the feather blades. upon first usage, it was all types of cuts since the first passes didn&#x27;t do much of anything. adjusting to the nature of the blades, the second shave went well, even though that had to do with scrubbing my head with peppermint oil and using cold water to shave. the best advice for using the personna blades if you have hair that isn&#x27;t straight is to thoroughly wash the area being shaved and do two passes to get the clean look.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure the blades are fine, I don&#x27;t know where they were made, they say America. If you read the product description, it reads as though it was written by someone for whom English is not their first language. Grammar really does matter.</li>
    <li> I get some of the best shaves with these blades.  Excellent cutting ability.  I use these blades on days when I haven’t shaved in a while, on Sundays and special occasions.</li>
    <li> After going back to double edge shaving a few months back, I have been searching for the &amp;#34;holy grail&amp;#34; blades for my shavers and my face. Fellas, you all know every man&#x27;s face is different. One man&#x27;s &amp;#34;perfect shaver&amp;#34; is another man&#x27;s &amp;#34;guillotine&amp;#34;. With that said, for me, these blade work great in my Mekur Futur (Much better than the &amp;#34;Feather&amp;#34; blades) and also perform as well in my vintage &#x27;59 Gillette &amp;#34;Fat Boy&amp;#34; razor. I just bought the Trumper&#x27;s shave cream (see my review) and I have to say that I am VERY VERY happy with the shaves I&#x27;m getting . Give em a try!</li>
    <li> I bought these because they were made in the USA, along with a Merkur razor. The Merkur blade wasn&#x27;t great, but I love these. Nice close shave, very few nicks and cuts as long as I don&#x27;t use them too long. I&#x27;ve been swapping them about weekly. Highly recommended - in 2 years when these are gone, I&#x27;ll be buying more - why shop around if you can find something made at home that works well.</li>
    <li> Use with CAUTION!  These razors are very sharp which makes them more aggressive than what I&#x27;m accustomed to.  I tried these razors looking for an even more closer shave than I was getting from my Merkur blades.  I&#x27;d been using Merkur blades as of late and I also like the Feather &amp; 7 o&#x27;clock blades, but I was looking for something a little more aggressive because I shave both my head &amp; face, so  I needed the blades to last a little longer (in my head), especially because I only had ten of them (2 - 5 packs).  I took a chance on these blades because they were in YouTube reviewers ShaveBusta &amp; TSE-Traditional Shaving Evangelist&#x27;s Top List of blades.  I haven&#x27;t nicked myself in quite sometime using Merkur blades in my Merkur 180c razor.  However, when I received these blades, I&#x27;d just gotten a handmade razor from an Etsy seller (DampCellarTurnings) and used both the following morning upon receipt.  I must say that the heft of my new razor and the sharpness of the blade contributed to the couple of nicks that I&#x27;d gotten, but that only means that I have to take a little more time getting adjusted to the new razor and blades.  I&#x27;m sure that I&#x27;m going to try them in my Merkur razor and a couple of future razors that I have in mind as well.  Wow, when did shaving become such a hobby....LOL?  This razor blade is not for DE Shaving newbies or the feint of heart, but for those who dare try it, I say again; Use Caution!!!  KDM</li>
    <li> Razors that take these blades seem to be making a comeback and a friend was raving about how close the shave is.  I needed razors anyway, so I ordered these blades along with a Kinbar®Black Long Handled Safety Razor.  I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised.  I had learned to shave with my grandfather&#x27;s old safety razor, but that was 30 years ago, so it took a little getting used to. The shave is very close (part of that credit has to go to the Kinbar I mentioned).  The first time I shaved with these, I experienced some irritation, but I think it was just because I was getting used to it.  You can&#x27;t shave with these the same way as you can with a Schick Quattro.  Subsequent shaves were a much better experience and I can go longer between shaves.  Plus, it feels like the hair grows back less course than before.  So far, I&#x27;m using about 1 blade a month. However, I think it&#x27;s important to note that I have a full beard and only shave my cheeks and neck, so your mileage and comfort level may vary.  At this price, what have you got to lose?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other blades. Price is good, however everything isn&#x27;t about the cheapest. Even if the price were raised slightly and the blades were not as thin, the shave of my neck would be much better than it is.</li>
    <li> Value for money. Sharpness of the blade lasted longer than expected.</li>
    <li> Great replacement blades use for a lot of different job.</li>
    <li> These blades are terrible. I cannot even get a complete shave out of a blade before it begins to feel dull. I am going to throw the remaining 80ish blades into the trash unused as they aren&#x27;t worth the aggravation. I am extremely glad that these aren&#x27;t the first blades I tried when I got my safety razor or I would have blamed the system. These blades are absolute garbage, which is a shame because I like supporting companies that manufacture in the U.S.A.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY!!!</li>
    <li> Love these blades.  I pair them with a Weber SS Classic handle DE safety razor, and the feedback is unlike any other blade I&#x27;ve tried -- singing perhaps!  They are smooth and sharp without being too keen edged.  Not as deft as a Feather, but considering the price and made in u.s.a., it is a great deal and gives a comfortable shave!</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s to be said other than great sharp razor blades for a great price.</li>
    <li> I am fairly new to the world of DE shaving but I must say I love these blades. Quality blades that are made in The U.S, what is not to love? Way smoother shave than the Derbys, but then again I have only tried 4 different brands, in order from Best to worse for me is These, Derby, Astra Super Platinum and Wilkinson Sword. If you have Sensitive skin and a coarse beard give these a try.</li>
    <li> Excellent razors. However, the Feather razors produce a closer, gentler shave albeit they are more expensive.</li>
    <li> Very consistent blades.  Hold up as good as any.  Packaging is extremely convenient.  American made is just a bonus.</li>
    <li> I began DE shaving about two weeks ago and based on the reviews of this product purchased 200.These blades meet my needs.I use a 1951 Gillette Super Speed(belonged to my Grandaddy O&#x27;Brien) and I average four, three pass shaves per blade.This is exactly what i was looking for.These blades are sharp and smooth.I get no irritation or razor burn and I&#x27;m saving money every time I shave.What more can you ask for?</li>
    <li> Not the biggest fan of these and wish I bought a smaller pack to test, but they do get the job done. Have had a few bad blades out of the batch.</li>
    <li> Nice, sharp, cheap and American Made.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok I guess, but I couldn&#x27;t really try them much because the Chinese razor I got to use them with didn&#x27;t work worth a... well you know what I mean.  So in all fairness, I cannot accurately rate this product.</li>
    <li> I have a heavy beard and each on lasts me about 7-8 shaves. For the package to last me two years I am saving lots of money. Just be careful and pay attention to what you are doing and go slow with even pressure and you will have a great shave.</li>
    <li> I started using safety razors about six months ago, and so far these have been the best. They have a great edge, retain sharpness, and made in the USA.</li>
    <li> Not very sharp at all. Can only get a single shave in before having to dispose and using a new one. Even then the shave isn&#x27;t very close at all. Ended up having to go to buy another brand at the store.</li>
    <li> This pack is really nice. Now I don&#x27;t really have to run to stores to look for a new razor blade, its just stored in the bathroom cabinet.</li>
    <li> As advertised. Much better than double edged razors and a lot easier to clean</li>
    <li> These blades are exactly what I needed. I will say that (like most other blades) there seems to be some inconsistency with sharpness but I have learned to expect that from almost all manufacturers. One blade will be super sharp and stay that way throughout the shave but others will have a slight pulling by midway through my second pass. I still highly recommend Personna DE Blades, well worth the money.</li>
    <li> OMG.  Only buy these if you don&#x27;t value the skin on your face.  Tried twice and looked like the cat attacked me!!!</li>
    <li> These are undoubtedly the worst blades I have tried. I&#x27;ve tried two of them and neither would even cut my beard. I don&#x27;t understand all the positive reviews. I couldn&#x27;t even get one shave out of them. Derbys, Astras, and Feathers are all far superior to these crappy blades. I really wanted to like them since they are supposedly American made, but I think I could get a better shave with my jack knife.</li>
    <li> Sharp, consistent. Great shave.</li>
    <li> Sharp and comfortable...get the job done with great expertise at a fraction of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> For my beard type the Israeli versions are far better than these. These were quit dull and pulled as well as left me bleeding.</li>
    <li> Yes my husband  is very happy with these blades and  we will be reordering them again in the future, as needed.</li>
    <li> Good but not great. I am a feather guy!</li>
    <li> They were sharp and precise.</li>
    <li> Feather is the best I&#x27;ve used yet, but these are great price and get the job done.</li>
    <li> These blades are excellent! They are sharp and give a very smooth shave.</li>
    <li> Use it once and done.  They do not last for multiple shaving days.</li>
    <li> One of the best razors I have tried next to the Gillete 7 O&#x27;Clock</li>
    <li> I have used several DE blades including the likes of Astra, Derby, Feather, Merkur, Shark, etc.  While everyone seems to agree that the Feather blades are the sharpest blades on the market, that does not necessarily translate into the best shaving experience for you and it does not mean that other blades are not sharp or that they do not provide a great shave.&lt;br /&gt;At $13.00 this 100 pack represents a per-blade cost of about 13 cents, which is hard to beat.  It also means that I do not hesitate to swap out a blade after a few uses so that I can enjoy a fresh blade on my next shave.  I have been using these blades in my long handle Merkur 23C and subjectively feel that the shave is just as close as when I use a Feather blade.  I am using a Prorasso pre-shave treatment and Prorasso Blue shaving cream which is lathered and applied with a badger hair brush.  Between the pre-shave and the lather I get a very nice, smooth shaving experience on par with the other popular brand of blades.  These blades are now on my &amp;#34;buy again&amp;#34; list.&lt;br /&gt;At this price, I suggest that you give them a try.</li>
    <li> In terms of price these blades can&#x27;t be beat. They shave great given the cost per blade. Blade is fairly sharp but not Feather sharp. This is good and bad. Good in that you don&#x27;t cut yourself if you get lazy with a shave stroke or two. Bad in that it does not cut as well as a Feather. At least for me, they last about 1-2 shaves before replacing. I thought at first not having a dispenser for old blades like most blade cartridges would be annoying but I really didn&#x27;t notice anything now that I use them. Overall I like the Feather blades best but I would definitely buy these again because of the value and above average shave. Very surprised at how well they shave given the price.</li>
    <li> Pulled out the first blade and had the best shave of my life. Every shave since has been approximately as amazing.</li>
    <li> These blades were really sharp when I got them, but after I got to the 5th blade in the pack or so, they started being much duller, and started pulling my hair a lot more. I was really in love with the first few blades, and these would be my absolute favorite if the pack continued that way. I won&#x27;t be ordering these again any time soon, and I already purchased new blades to replace these ones even though I have a bunch left.</li>
    <li> Switched to a safety razor less than six months ago and these are the second blades I have tried. Tried the Merkur blades and I think these Personna blades are superior. Mind you, I am only three to four blades in, but they seem higher quality than the Merkur. In my package of 10 Merkur, I would say at least three or four were noticeably duller. So far these Personna blades are very sharp and reliable. Will update this later but this box will last me awhile. I typically use for one week, but that is after shaving every morning. If you don&#x27;t shave daily, they will last a lot longer. Great product!</li>
    <li> awesome blades cannot go wrong with these love the price and the qty.  Made in USA.  comparable to merker brand but i find these to be better for closer comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried Astras, Feathers and these Personnas.  They are noticeably better than Astras and they seem as sharp as Feathers but last longer. I rotate through a collection of Gillette razors including a Fat Boy, Slim, Flare Tip, Black Tip, Edwin Jäger DE89, and several Techs. The Personnas are consistently superior in all of these razors.  I am going to use up my Astras in my DE89 and Techs one shave apiece because these razors are  so forgiving. I will only use the Personnas in my Fat Boy and Slim for my everyday shave and the Feathers in the Flare and Black tip when I am up for a challenge.  If I had to choose only one combo for the rest of my life it would be my M2 birthday Slim with Personna blades and Proraso cream.</li>
    <li> Personna Lab Blues are really great blades.  To me, they are almost as sharp as Feathers but are much smoother shavers.  The price is great and they are made in the USA, so what&#x27;s not to love?</li>
    <li> I got these for my brother who has a heavy beard. I mean like an hour after a shave he has a five o&#x27;clock shadow. I was hoping that this would provide a better shave for him. And it has! these blades don&#x27;t tear up his skin like other types and they get a close comfortable shave which (I think) his wife is loving. So if you are needing a good shave to have a touchable face from a ladies point of view this is worth a go.</li>
    <li> I am not sure if it is my skin type, but I still get several nicks and cuts each time I shave.  While I am saving money not having to buy expensive disposable razors, I waste time having to slow the bleeding from my neck and face each time I shave.</li>
    <li> Great value on solid product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these blades for about a year and get fantastic shaves. They are &amp;#34;Sharp enough&amp;#34;&#x27; to get a smooth shave but extremely forgiving. Great price too!  Can&#x27;t go wrong with these blades!</li>
    <li> Great value for money blades, just the right amount of sharpness for clean smooth shaves without causing cuts and abrasions.&lt;br /&gt;So glade I discovered DE safety razor shaving, thanks to Sharpologist.&lt;br /&gt;Better shaves and saving money compared to multi blades every time.</li>
    <li> These are a great example of the argument between Quantity vs Quality. The box I received will easily last me a full year, I get around 3-5 shaves out of each blade. It&#x27;s really hard to argue with $14 for a years worth of shaving. I wish that they would last a little longer but for the price it&#x27;s about what you should expect. My only suggested improvement would be that there is no built in way to safely store old blades once you are done with them.</li>
    <li> Great blade. Sharp and lasts me about a week. Its a toss up between these and my Feather blades. You wont be disappointed!</li>
    <li> This is the third safety razor I have tried, started with Derby, then tried Shark, and now Personna.  The Shark blades were the sharpest that I have tried, but the quality was inconsistent from blade to blade, I would use one and think &amp;#34;Wow this is a good blade!&amp;#34; and then I would get one that wasn&#x27;t near as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imo the Personna is not a sharp as the Shark, though the consistency seems good.  As I bought 100 of them I will have plenty of time to get used to them.  Also I found them to be a little less sharp than the Derby, which really surprised me because I&#x27;ve read a lot of good things about the Personna.  Today at the office I passed my hand over my throat and thought &amp;#34;Did I forget to shave it?&amp;#34; because it was pretty rough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I wish I had bought more Derby instead, they come in those nifty plastic containers.</li>
    <li> Awful, awful shave. I have coarse hair, and clear-cut every couple of days. I use both regular old Barbasol (nothing wrong with it, hipsters) and also Shave Secret (which I recommend). I use a Merkur razor. I don&#x27;t really have any sensitivity issues. These blades are like dragging a rasp across even the easiest parts of my face to shave.  I tried them on two occasions, a brand new blade each time, and each time removed them and slapped in a smooth-cutting Derby Extra. I should&#x27;ve known when the package said &amp;#34;Made in USA&amp;#34;. Buy Turkish-made Derby Extra blades.</li>
    <li> A decent DE blade.  Good value and quality.  I recommend them even though I like other brands a tad better.... for instance Gillette Silver Blues.</li>
    <li> Good blade and a great price.  Wondering how to dispose of the used blades safely though.</li>
    <li> Best value for money for safety razors.</li>
    <li> I like aster blades better.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the shaves I get using these Personna blades. They give a close comfortable shave that does not irritate my face. I usually get 5 to 6 shaves from each blade, so they are an excellent value. I prefer the 100 blade box as it conserves space in my shaving cabinet. I keep an old pill bottle to dispose of the used blades.</li>
    <li> sharp and works great</li>
    <li> Nice shipped fast great price</li>
    <li> I wanted to try an alternative to expensive disposable razors, so I read as many reviews on double edge blades as possible.  I bought the Kinbar Long Handled Safety Razor and went for the 100 pack of these Personna double edge razor blades.  I have been using these for a couple months now and am quite pleased with the results.  These give a much closer shave than with disposables and I am able to use a blade for about a week or two.  I have to admit that I knick my face a bit more than usual but never anything serious.  You&#x27;ll have the closest shave after the first try, and after a couple shaves you&#x27;ll get the knack of these sharp blades.  I would recommend these to just about anybody unless you have a very bumpy or overly-sensitive face.  I estimate this pack will get me through almost two years of shaving.</li>
    <li> Was very pleased with the product as well as the delivery</li>
    <li> they are as good as name brands nice shave</li>
    <li> Nice sharp blades at a great price that work great for my tough/wiry beard. I was previously using Feather blades which gave me two good shaves per blade. To me these are just as sharp as feathers and I get two great shaves per blade as well. But from the price point of view, I get two of these packs to one pack of Feathers, with the same quality shave and sharpness. Of course YMMV.</li>
    <li> I used it many times . Great product within that price.</li>
    <li> First time shaver with double edged razor.  I cannot compare to other products only that it is functional.  Each blade lasts about 5 - 7 days before it pulls the beard.</li>
    <li> American made, inexpensive, but sharp and smooth. About as good as the Astra Platinums, but a tad less sharp than Feathers - but half the price.</li>
    <li> blades are good for one shave</li>
    <li> For the first time shaving with a safety razor I&#x27;m Impressed Nice Chrome</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say this is the sharpest thing in the world but it&#x27;s sharp enough.</li>
    <li> Great Blades!  Very sharp and well priced. Excellent Shave!!</li>
    <li> I started using my old single edge razor again due to the lack of a decent shave. It seems like razor blades are so expensive for the junk out there, these Personna  blades seem to do the job, I always used Wilkinson blades, but for the price I thought I would try these, I happy with my choice...</li>
    <li> Fantastic close shave, closer than any disposable multiblade. Each blade seems to be good for 5 or 6 shaves, so very economical. But not TSA friendly!</li>
    <li> Great razors, never understood why anyone would pay $20 for five stupid five razor&#x27;s in a line.  Got a nice German safety razor, change the single razor thin blade two to three times a week.  100 single blades for $7. Have to be an idiot to buy Gillette or Schick</li>
    <li> This blade started my safety blade experience. It also nearly ended it. The blades just aren&#x27;t sharp enough -- too much tugging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a month of a sub-par experience, I decided to try out some other blades (Astra &amp; Sword) before going back to disposables. These blades were gave me a much better shave. If you are new to the safety blade game, try other blades first.</li>
    <li> Not as good as Feather or even the Merkur blade that came with my razor, but they&#x27;re half the price of other brands--they just last half as long, which is probably fine for people who don&#x27;t have thick, fast growing facial hair and sensitive skin, but not good for me since I have all of the above and have to shave daily.</li>
    <li> I like the price, but unfortunately, these blades are not very sharp. Barely last for the first shave, much less for a second shave.They are not effective on certain parts of my face where my beard is particularly thick and tough. Requires that I make multiple passes from different directions, causing a lot of razor burn.</li>
    <li> Excellent razors. Sharp and durable.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong.  Great value!</li>
    <li> I never knew why I had adult ache until hearing a story on Marketplace about a condition that is caused by hairs that are cut too close to the skin.  I started using these blades, along with a good aftershave and I no longer look like a horny 15 year old.  For those that this might help, I use these blades, plus the Proraso soap and Proraso aftershave (which I add tea tree oil to when I get it), and I am now 99% ache free.  I sincerely hope this helps someone.  I can&#x27;t understand why my doctors couldn&#x27;t tell me that I was cutting the hairs on my face too short.  I tried regular razors, electric, etc, but found that the safety razor is what I should have been using all along.  Good luck and happy shaving!!</li>
    <li> sharp razors, easy to change.  My legs have never been so smooth!</li>
    <li> Really a 4.5. Great blades, but not for me. Always willing to support Made in USA products, though. For &#x27;murica.</li>
    <li> Great blades. Definitely worth the money. And as an added bonus, the are made in the USA.</li>
    <li> Good sharp Razor Blades the only thing I could say bad about this is,I wished it came with a container to put the used blades</li>
    <li> UPDATE:  I contacted Personna customer service (1-888-254-2126). I explained my issues with the new blades. They sent me another pack with the BLUE wrappers and forwarded my complaint to their quality department for investigation. Great customer service. Great blades (in the blue wrapper)  I just finished my other pack that had the blades wrapped in blue logo printed paper. I have a tough beard and got almost a week of shaves out of a blade. The new pack has the blades wrapped in plain white paper. They are dull.  A new blade fells like the other pack after 5 shaves. These are not the same as the old blades. I will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Great product, well made and will buy more of these products in the future.</li>
    <li> The price is right. Made in USA. Sharp enough for my average beard and I get many close shaves with each blade. Quality control seems quite good - far better than those horrid Turkish blades from Derby - even though it appears that Persona is owned by Derby. Cheaper than Merkur and I believe Personas are better. I haven&#x27;t tried Feather Blades but I don&#x27;t fancy facial seppuku either - I&#x27;m not brave enough for those. With 100 blades per box I won&#x27;t have to order against for a long, long time.</li>
    <li> Nice close shave in only 2 passes. Coarsers beards may need one relather and another pass. No nicks no cuts so far. I use this with the Mekur 38HD long pole razor.</li>
    <li> I purchased these for my husband. He found his safety razor while going through a drawer and wanted to compare the quality of shave. He was very pleased with these blades and prefers them to his schick power shaver.</li>
    <li> I come from 25 years of using cartridge razors, having grown tired of paying the seemingly ever-increasing price of replacement cartridge blades. I use these in the Merkur safety razor, and can get just as close a shave, if not closer, though it does take a bit longer, having to be a bit more careful and do at least a second pass. Noticeably less razor burn versus cartidges.  I swap out weekly, shaving daily. Overall, I enjoy shaving more, and combined with Proraso shaving soap, my face feels fresh for hours after a nice shave.</li>
    <li> Very good price for this item. I will use them every where.  Good item to have in your medicine cabinet.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have very thick or dense facial hair, but these blades still manage to pull while shaving and require multiple passes to get just an \\&quot;ok shave.\\&quot; A fresh shave with these leaves my face feeling like a day old shave with a feather blade -my preference, even if I do manage to nick myself once and a blue moon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose one \\&quot;pro\\&quot; to these blades is I haven&#x27;t managed to cut myself with one yet, they&#x27;re just so dull compared to what I&#x27;m used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not regret buying the 100 pack though, they will work in a pinch and I can give them to friends who manage to get a decent shave with them. Its too bad though that they don&#x27;t work well for me, this pack of blades could have easily lasted me years.</li>
    <li> Since I received the blades I am only on my second blade. They stay sharp so much longer than anything i could buy locally.</li>
    <li> Granted I am new to wet shaving but I couldn&#x27;t have gotten luckier.  Most guides recommend a sample pack a blades to find what works best for you, but these turned out to be perfect.  Aggressive enough so that I can do only two passes (with and across), but gentle enough that I&#x27;ve really only cut myself on a trouble area with a large mole - and now I&#x27;ve learned to avoid doing so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love that they&#x27;re made in the USA even though the rest of my setup isn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin and a relatively thick and uniform beard.  Ingrown hairs are now a thing of the past! Using with a Merkur 34C and Proraso Sensitive (white containers) Pre-Shave Cream and Soap.</li>
    <li> I started double edge shaving last year, and tried out a number of different blades. I found these blades to be sharp - comparable to the Feather brand - at a much reduced cost.</li>
    <li> They work well, I get  shaves out of each blade.  I have not used other blades so I cannot compare, but these are very fine compared to the standard razor I was using before going safety razor.</li>
    <li> Should be able to get more than 2 decent shaves from 1 blade!</li>
    <li> Prefer these over feather blades.  Personna are easier on the face!</li>
    <li> The best I&#x27;ve tried....</li>
    <li> Got this for my dad&#x27;s manual razor. He&#x27;s happy with and its glide-coated stainless steel blades are now 25% sharper.</li>
    <li> Im sure they are sharp, haven&#x27;t had chance to use yet</li>
    <li> The only ones I have ever found close to the comfort and closeness of a shave is the Personna Double Edge &amp;#34;Hospital Use Only&amp;#34; blades and after that, the Personna Double Blades made in Israel.  Last a long time.  I even carefully wipe between my finger and thumb being very diligent to avoid the sharp edge.  Let it dry on a cloth and keep using it for several shaves.</li>
    <li> I watched many reviews on youtube regarding the Personna blades, which is why I purchased a box.  The razor that I purchased came with Dorco blades and those blades didn&#x27;t have as good a review as the Personna blades so I decided to use these blades instead and it gave me a very good shave.  I am pleased with this product and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Awesome blades at a great price! MADE IN THE USA!&lt;br /&gt;Great combination of sharp and smooth.</li>
    <li> So far I am very happy with these blades. Very sharp and makes for a clean shave.</li>
    <li> product is sharp. does a great job. I get 3 shaves on each blade.  The price is excellent. Double edge blades are hard to find anymore in the stores.Amazon is a great way to make products available.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to the double ede shave. The blades are good.  I get about 3-4 shaves out of each which is about average. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I use them with my Amazon Mehaz safety razor just like in the old days before disposable razors and they work great. This type of blade and handle will save you LOTS of money. It just might take a couple of shaves to develop a new &#x27;muscle memory&#x27; for your hands as you learn it&#x27;s different feel but well worth it to watch your bank account slowly rise. The family will love that sight.</li>
    <li> These are the worst razors that I have ever use,if I haven&#x27;t discarded the package it came in it would most certainly return the whole kit,razors and all</li>
    <li> A review for shaving blades is very subjective.  You may have a very different experience than I did with these blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a dense and very coarse beard, especially around my chin.  Also, I easily get irritation around my chin and neck.  These blades just don&#x27;t work for me.  I find the Gillette 7 O&#x27;clock Super Platinum blades provide me with a much closer and more comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I opted for 2 stars instead of 1 because they&#x27;re not horrible blades...they just don&#x27;t work for my beard type.  You should try a few different blades in small quantities and figure out what works best for you.  Don&#x27;t buy a 100 pack until you know.  Hind sight is 20/20...lol</li>
    <li> I went from using feather to these.  I find these are easier on the skin but shave just as close.  Great deal to think you can buy 100 for the price most would pay for a dozen.  In addition, these are made in the good old USA!</li>
    <li> These blades are similar to the Wilkerson Sword blades from the local big box retailer.  I have not found any negative issues, they work just fine.</li>
    <li> Love the baldes, I have switched to the old type of razor.  Prefer over the new ones.</li>
    <li> My disgust with the upwardly spiraling price of disposable cartridges got me back to using the simple Double edge safety razor after many years of believing the multiple blade myth. After trying a few different brands and styles of blades, German, Russian, Japanese and even Kroger Brand I picked a box of these &amp;#34;Made in the USA&amp;#34; Persona blades at this extremely low price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My own experience with these blades has been great and I&#x27;ve been getting 4 or 5 shaves out of each blade. While those of you with Steel Wool beards may not get as many shaves as I do, you&#x27;ll find these blades to be affordable and easy to keep clean. These blades come in a simple dispenser box and individually paper wrapped.</li>
    <li> I recommend, can&#x27;t beat the price, made in USA, super sharp, great shave. I got 100 blades, I probably won&#x27;t have to buy more for 10 years!</li>
    <li> Well packaged and performs nicely.</li>
    <li> Cut just as well as feathers at a much cheaper price. I will be buying these from now on.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and have been using Gillette Fusion blades for years, but I was tired of taking out a second mortgage to pay for the refills. So I tried going old school and took out my old stainless steel razor and ordered the Personna blades based on reviews claiming they were good for sensitive skin types.&lt;br /&gt;After 20 seconds, I had more nicks and cuts than I could count. If I continued, I would need a blood transfusion. Fortunately, I still had a Gillette blade left and finished my shave with that.&lt;br /&gt;It has been 2 days since using the Personna and my face still stings. I have been applying ointment to treat the cuts.&lt;br /&gt;NEVER AGAIN!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand for about 8 months now, I originally bought them with my merkur double edge razor. Although I don&#x27;t have another brand to compare them with, i haven&#x27;t had any problems with them. they do the job, great product, and great price.</li>
    <li> I am sure these blades are okay if you have light facial hair but I have heavy facial hair and thick hair at that so I do not get a good shave with these blades.  I find astra&#x27;s and sharks are sharper and better.</li>
    <li> Perfect!! Happy I purchased&lt;br /&gt;Good price</li>
    <li> Great item, works well.  It&#x27;s so inexpensive I can afford to use a new blade for each shave and that is a true luxury in my world.  On top of that my shave is closer with these blades than any other I&#x27;ve ever used.  The fact that these blades are still made in America is another plus.</li>
    <li> These blades are awesome!  Affordable, American made, and sharp as hell.  You can&#x27;t beat &#x27;em.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an advocate of old fashioned shaving (I search out old double edged razors in Thrift Stores) - I figure I&#x27;ve saved maybe $200-$300 over the past 5 years by doing so.  Sometimes I buy Personnas, and sometimes I get the Wilkinsons - Frankly, I think the Wilkinsons are the better blade, but if these were significantly cheaper, I&#x27;d get these - whatever, they&#x27;re still a hell of a lot better than any of the current ripoff shaving systems out there!</li>
    <li> Do a great job of cutting the stubble off of my face.</li>
    <li> Good Blades at a decent price.</li>
    <li> I bought these to go with a Edwin Jagger DE89Lbl Lined Detail Chrome Plated Double Edge Safety Razor I purchased at the same time, and I seriously doubt you can find a better deal!  Compared to the brand name razors you can buy at a store, these blades win hands down! Not only are they better in quality &amp; performance, but the price trumps the big brand name razors, by far!  I&#x27;ve noticed that after using these blades I don&#x27;t get razor burn - AT ALL! I no longer endure dreading the day after shaving &amp; the itchy, red bumps that go along with it.  I highly recommend these blades, along with a double-edged razor to any and all people looking to save some cash, without compromising with quality.</li>
    <li> These are my favorite blades for use with my safety razor. I get about 6 shaves per blade and could probably get more. They work as well as those expensive cartridges for cents a month.</li>
    <li> Very sharp blades I use them to shave my head and face. great buy</li>
    <li> Very sharp so be careful but you&#x27;ll get the closest shave ever without the big price. Easy dispenser without worry of cutting yourself.</li>
    <li> I use the Personna blades every day for a close, smooth shave --  and a blade lasts 7 days!  High quality at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> These are made in the USA. Personna/ASR makes the only blades made in America and that is important to me. I&#x27;ve tried them among various other blades including the Israeli made Personnas and nothing ever holds a candle to them. These are by far the sharpest and smoothest blades I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> These do the job but to honest do not work well for me. Maybe it is my beard/skin type, but it irritates my face regardless what razor or soap I use. IMO not as good as may people say it is. The Gillettes and Polsilvers are far superior in every way.</li>
    <li> These are sharp &amp; can do a number of your face without you even knowing it. I would recommend to family &amp; friends my order arrived on the date scheduled in an unopened undamaged carton</li>
    <li> Good quality at a good price.</li>
    <li> just received, too soon to tell, but price for quanity is great</li>
    <li> Excellent blades! I love the quality and the quantity!&lt;br /&gt;Price is right, plus they&#x27;re made in the USA!&lt;br /&gt;Have been DE shaving for over 4 years now... These are now my favorite - replaced my Feather blades!&lt;br /&gt;Like always... YMMV</li>
    <li> Great blades for my Muhle R89.  Great price as well I think.  I like that they&#x27;re made in there USA being that&#x27;s where I live.</li>
    <li> These are NOT the blue paper wrapped Personna Lab Blue blades. I&#x27;m not sure what Personna did to these blades but they do not shave like the Lab Blues. I will not buy these again and wouldn&#x27;t recommend them if you&#x27;re looking for the Blues.</li>
    <li> Bought these the day after I got my new safety razor,when everything arrived ( timely as usual ) I first used the Merkur blade that came with my razor it was my first shave ever with a safety razor, I was blown away at how nice it was my technique of course was lacking and got a little irrational but by my 3 rd shave was getting better on that 3rd shave I could feel a small tug so after I was finished I throw the Merkur blade away. The next shave I used these blades and holy cow!!! It was twice as close and twice as smooth as the Merkur blade, I&#x27;m aware it could&#x27;ve have been poor technique on first bkade but these are amazing! I know I can get more shaves out of them but I chage blades after 2-3 shaves I just love the new blade shave and for .14cents it&#x27;s well worth it!!! I may try the feathers in the future but theses will always be close by in my shave kit!!</li>
    <li> Great razors for the price. Using one ever day-or-two but still a great deal.</li>
    <li> These razors are fantastic. I&#x27;ve only tried a few different double edge razors, but these are by far the best so far. They give me a great shave and are very smooth, plus they&#x27;re made in the USA, what more could you ask for.</li>
    <li> Personna makes several different tiers of blades. These are the best they made, *identical* to their more expensive med prep blades. I have purchased both the med prep and these blue labels, and I cannot feel or tell the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;vs Feathers: Feathers feel smoother/sharper. However, feathers are *notorious* for losing their edge quickly, and I find personally find them to last no more then one shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin/hair type: Sensitive skin with *very* thick straight stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Razors I use on a regular basis: Merkur 180, and the Merkur 39c Slant razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My shaving technique (ATG &#x3D; against the grain, XTG &#x3D; across the grain, WTG &#x3D; with the grain):&lt;br /&gt; * 1 day growth: ATG (yes, possible *only* with proper angle and a sharp sharp blade) and lots of ATG scrubbing until smooth.&lt;br /&gt; * 2-3 days growth: XTG, before the above&lt;br /&gt; * 3+ days growth: add in WTG before the above&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blade durability for those doing ATG:&lt;br /&gt;ATG requires a very keen edge to have nick free shaves. With that in mind, I get 2 shaves out of the personnas, and 1 out of the feathers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blade durability for those doing WTG only:&lt;br /&gt;I have a friend that gets 20+ WTG only shaves with the feathers and he&#x27;s happy with it. Personnas, he hasn&#x27;t swapped it out yet after 30 shaves.</li>
    <li> Work great, no irritation, low price, these will last a long time, no cartridge for me ever again, wish I had purchased years ago.</li>
    <li> This blades aee sharper than the Wilkinson Sword blades and I will definitely stock up on a second box. Worth every penny(and thats exactly what every blade cost: pennies)!</li>
    <li> Not as sharp as Japanese Feather razor or Shark blades, but not bad. They were a great price and last long. You get 100!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have a thick beard, it&#x27;s more scrappy, but I can still get a very close shave with this razor.&lt;br /&gt;Picked 4 for price and quantity.&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t pick 5 because of quality, it&#x27;s still a sharp DE blade but there are def. sharper blades out there.</li>
    <li> this is a good sharp, smooth blade, made in the good old USA. Hard to beat these blades for the price.</li>
    <li> After working my way through over a dozen different blade options, I can say with certainty that these are my favorite double edge razor blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I like them:&lt;br /&gt; - They&#x27;re made in the USA&lt;br /&gt; - They&#x27;re among the sharpest you&#x27;ll find&lt;br /&gt; - They&#x27;re more forgiving than some of the other blades on the sharper end of the spectrum (I&#x27;m looking at you, Feather)&lt;br /&gt; - They&#x27;re a fantastically good deal when you buy them in the 100 pack&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are really no negatives to them that I&#x27;ve found.  They work incredibly well.  I&#x27;d be buying these blades even if they were more expensive, but I love that they&#x27;re among the less expensive blades available.  If you&#x27;re looking for a pack of double edge razor blades that will do a great job, I&#x27;d start with these.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve never used a double edge safety razor, you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re missing.  If you do use a double edge safety razor and haven&#x27;t tried these blades, you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re missing.  I&#x27;m very pleased with these Made in USA double edge safety razor blades.  I get several shaves from each blade, and shaving is a pleasure now, rather than a chore.</li>
    <li> After trying several different blades and having varying success that&#x27;s are the winner for me</li>
    <li> I use these blades first off because they are the best for my skin type and second and most important is they are Made in the USA. I have a couple hundred of other blades along with a couple hundred Persona&#x27;s and think they out shave the others hands down. I like Feathers but you are paying major bucks for a blade that is not much sharper.  I use my blades four shaves but could get more , I just like the sharpness of my blades so they are changed before they are used up.  God bless those American companies that hire American workers, thanks Persona from a loyal customer.</li>
    <li> Good and they are US made.</li>
    <li> These Personna blades are one of my favorites.  They are very sharp yet smooth and forgiving and usually last for 4-6 shaves.</li>
    <li> Why pay so much for those refill razors?  I have been using a straight razor for years, but got tired of sharpening it.  Saw these and couldn&#x27;t believe the price for 100.  I get about 5 shaves on each blade. do the math.  Even with price of the Merkur safety razor it beats paying 5 bucks per refill!</li>
    <li> I tried several other DE blades before I purchased the Personna DE razor blades.  These are awesome!  Smooth shave (I got 3 shaves before I changed the blade, but I think I could get 1 or 2 more shaves out of one), doesn&#x27;t tug at all and they are sharp but not too sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Not all blades perform the same for everyone.  These just happen to work well for me.</li>
    <li> Terrible. Cut up my face and never got a close shave. Going back to the sharper bettrr quality ones</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried sampler blade packs--Feather, Shark, even Dorco. Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, but these Personna blades, surprisingly, are my favorite! This was shocking since they&#x27;re so cheap, but I quickly bought another 100 and recommended this to all my shaving buddies. I now have enough blades for 10 years!</li>
    <li> After being quite happy with another blade (Shark Super Chrome) for months, I decided to try the Persona &amp;#34;blue&amp;#34; because they are made in the USA, and because of the many positive reviews posted here. I will NOT try to shave with Persona again after my first attempt left my face red, nicked, and burning. It seemed far more dull than the Shark Super Chrome. It reminded me of  the Shark Super Stainless, a much duller blade than the Shark Super Chrome. Given that many others are happy with the Persona blues, I assume that it is all very subjective. My beard is heavy, and I shave against the grain, so I would recommend against the Persona if you feel that your beard and shaving style are similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides being made in the USA, what I do like about the Personas is that they use minimal packaging. Perhaps they should release a more aggressive blade for those of us with thicker whiskers.</li>
    <li> This is a great blade. Just not the best. I switched to a double edge safety razor a few months ago because I was shocked at the price of the modern multi-blade replacement cartridges. This is a great value at about $.12 per blade. I get at least 2 or 3 shaves per blade with no irritation. I thought the Merkur blades cut closer and lasted longer, but they are more money as well.</li>
    <li> Super compact packaging. Easy to open and dispense. These blades give a perfect shave. I dispose after each shave for a super-fresh cut. Love these!</li>
    <li> These blades are top quality. They are very reminiscent of the blades I used back in the 80&#x27;s. I still have some old Schick blades from then and I can&#x27;t tell them apart. I also compared these to a new Merkur blade and found the Persona to be better for me. The Merkur blades seem thinner and less durable and I sliced myself with them. I also like them better than my vintage Wilkinson Swords which also cut me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still have my 1970 vintage Gillette double edge handle which balances well with the Persona blades. And they are offered at a great price for a pack of 100. I&#x27;ve been getting two weeks worth of shave from a blade but I mix it up with a straight shave with a shavette with a long blade. I haven&#x27;t snapped a P blade in half to use in the shavette but I plan on trying that. I hope Personna never stops making these blades. In the USA no less!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Word to the beginners : don&#x27;t expect a good blade shave with canned shaving cream. Get a brush and some high quality shaving soap or cream. I&#x27;ve been using Body Shop for Men and won&#x27;t go back to canned ever. Also take the time to learn the grain pattern of your beard. With the grain, against the grain and then across the grain...it matters.</li>
    <li> I tried half a dozen blades before I tried these, and these were the best for me.  Not even Feathers were better.  Mild shave, but sharp enough so that pulling was minimal. Give these a shot.</li>
    <li> American made.  Excellent blades.</li>
    <li> Edit 9/9/2014  ... These are probably as good as Feather blades?  I&#x27;m still using Feather blades, but I&#x27;ve found that as long as the blades are very good, which these are, then it&#x27;s the shaving gel that is going to be important. The consistency of the blades is also probably important.  But without a really good shaving gel, then there&#x27;s going to be a problem with anything.     ----    These are my back up blades, in case I ever run out of Feather blades.  They are better than most others.  I don&#x27;t plan on throwing them away.    If you need to save 50 cents a month, then these are your choice.</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s not to like, great price, made in the USA, Holds sharp edge long enough to get a week&#x27;s worth of shaves out of one double sided blade.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and seller!</li>
    <li> it really is a matter of cost-benefit, but I also have sensitive skin which can get easily irritated and subsequently abraded. These razors work great and no cuts when applied to the surface of the skin correctly.</li>
    <li> For the price to quality ratio, these DE blades are hard to beat. They offer a close, comfortable shave when paired with a good DE razor (I use a plasticky Feather butterfly razor, or a nice Merkur vintage Gillette copy.)  I get about 3 shaves with each blade; my beard is coarse and heavy but these blades get the job done. American made quality that&#x27;s inexpensive, but not cheap.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x60;t seen the brand in many years. Recommended by my barber. Great to know a great product is still manufactured in the&lt;br /&gt;U.S.A. Good price and timely delivery.</li>
    <li> Great blades, very smooth shave, no pulling, you can hear the whiskers being cut but you cant feel it.  Personna twin blade disposable razors cost less then one Personna DE blade and work great also. American quality at its best.</li>
    <li> Wow these blades last long and cut amazing. I compared with a twin blade Bic type unit and the Personal was way better and still lasting after 8 shaves. On top of that it&#x27;s American made, yea baby I love it.</li>
    <li> The sharpest blades I have ever used, bar none, and I have used cryogenically-frozen blades before. They stay sharp and at 100 blades you have several years worth of blades at an excellent price.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with order.</li>
    <li> Sharpness 8 Durability  9 Smooth  7 Price five star</li>
    <li> I bought a 100 pack of these about a year ago and they are fantastic.  I had used other WAY more expensive brands in the past and have found that these give me a better shave at a fraction of the cost.  Can&#x27;t say enough about them.  Great blades and you&#x27;ll pay 10X the price for some of the other brands and won&#x27;t get a better shave.</li>
    <li> I just love these razor blades. Was a bit skeptical read the reviews. Right blades at the right price will return and buy more it&#x27;s a very simple choice. They are worth every penny. My face is like a babies well you know!</li>
    <li> Good thing there are 100 in the pack. Only get 2 shaves a blade.</li>
    <li> I bought these without having tried them, and I love them.  These are among my favorite blades, up there with Shark&#x27;s.  Obviously blades are different for everyone, but these are very sharp.  I&#x27;ve tried Feathers, and those are too sharp for my face.  These are about perfect and I rarely see a knick and always get a solid shave.  The price on these was excellent and worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I am using these blades for about 10-14 single pass shaves, and find them satisfactory. The 10-pack of the same brand seems to give a smoother shave.</li>
    <li> WOW! What a difference a real DE blade makes.  The complimentary Derby blades that came with the DE Razor I purchased do not represent DE Razors in a positive light, as those blades are awful.  Once I started shaving with the Personna blades, I could instantly tell the difference in quality and performance.  Shaving with the Personna blades there is no discomfort during and after shaving, smooth shave, closer shave, less to no nicks or razor burn, and the blade stays sharp/last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At less than 0.13 cents per blade compared to ~$3.00/blade for the Gillette Fusions, you can&#x27;t go wrong. I highly recommend these blades!  And they&#x27;re made in the USA to boot!</li>
    <li> 100 double edge  enough  to last  a year</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t dual edge shaved in years and now that I have decided to go back.&lt;br /&gt;I find these blades to be sharper than your common in store brands but not to sharp to start with as long as you go slow and give your face time to adjust. The edge gives great shaves through the seven day cycle that I use between blades.</li>
    <li> I recently returned to DE shaving after a couple of years using a Panasonic ES-LA63 electric (a very good shaver, but died after 2 years). After deciding there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;d pay the cartridge prices to use my old Gillette Fusion, I bought a Parker 96R Razor that came with Shark blades. The Sharks were adequate; I also tried Merkur (just okay, for me) and Feather (a bit too sharp). I ran across the Personnas here on Amazon and remembered that my dad used to use them, so I gave them a try. Glad I did, it&#x27;s the best, smoothest shave I&#x27;ve had in a few years. I&#x27;m a 50 y/o African American male with soft skin and medium to coarse facial hair, and these are great on my skin. Price is right too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these blades for a few months now.  They are great.  I change blades after every 2-3 shaves.  So I guess if I shave every other day, this box of 100 should last me a year or 2.  That&#x27;s value!</li>
    <li> Good blades, good price. 3-4 cents per shave. What&#x27;s not to like</li>
    <li> Great value! I can shave for nearly a month with the same blade. Nice clean shave each time.</li>
    <li> Great product. I would buy again</li>
    <li> Lot a bang for your buck. The blades work real well and leave my face as clean and smooth as I can expect. I would certainly buy these again.</li>
    <li> These blades are very sharp and last much longer than the unbranded drug-store variety I used before. They are priced extremely well and have reduced shaving expenses to nil along with my old Gillette and shaving soap. I always take my blade out of the razor and set it on a dry sponge after a shave... I find this more effective than the &amp;#34;baby oil&amp;#34; method. I did that a few times and one instance of quick-onset rust occurred. I get so many shaves for so little money that it doesn&#x27;t matter; I could get only one per blade (I usually get 3 if I do so consistently) and come out exponentially cheaper than the Mach III type of shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like rustic shaving, these are a great, cheap blade for reasonable closeness and comfort.</li>
    <li> The blades dull pretty easily but that is why there are 100 of them</li>
    <li> The only blade I&#x27;ll use on my clients</li>
    <li> Love this product, I bought this 100 pack in Jan. of 2014. I may never use this up !</li>
    <li> they work. I really dont have any complaints they work better than sharks or the Walgreen brand. i cant find anything wrong with them</li>
    <li> they are sharp and cut as they should</li>
    <li> Very good razors and American made, at a reasonable price.  Compared to my last bulk buy of double edge razors (Astra Superior Platinum, which were excellent, but made in Russia, IIRC), these don&#x27;t seem quite as sharp and dull noticeably quicker than the Astras. I could easily get 6-7 shaves on the Astras, while there&#x27;s a notable dullness during the fifth Personna shave. On the plus side, I&#x27;m not bleeding as much as with the previous purchase; the Astra&#x27;s used to give me some surprising and gory nicks every so often (I know, it&#x27;s operator error, but the Personnas seem more forgiving.) I use a Merkur long-handled safety razor.</li>
    <li> These blades work very well in my Merkur-Razor Long Handle Adjustable Razor.&lt;br /&gt;Its also a terrific value in the 100 ct pack.&lt;br /&gt;I have a very tough beard with very tough grays and this blade handles it with ease.&lt;br /&gt;I can use each blade for at least 3 times before I change into a new one.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I tried so many other razors but this is one gives the best shave without cutting. I am very happy with this and will buy again.</li>
    <li> My barber uses and gd price. Gd product. 2nd time buying and my girlfriend uses them as well. I recommend</li>
    <li> As a Master Barber I don&#x27;t have time for inconsistent products. Personna has been a trusted name in the trade for years. They are a little more costly but well worth it, and made in the Great USA!</li>
    <li> This is my first time using a safety razor and I am very please with the shave it provides. This is definitely a great value for the money.</li>
    <li> I use the Personna&#x27;s and Feather blades depending on the time of year and I absolutely love these blades. They are sharp, they last at least a long time (about 10 shaves) and they are priced just right. If you are starting out shaving and you have the correct razor these blades will work great. I have very sensitive skin and these blades are perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would (and do) recommend these blades to anyone wanting a great shave!</li>
    <li> I have been using those 3 blade Gillette blades for years .. Mach III.  Easy to clean, if I dry them after a shave and rub them backwards on my jeans, I can get a couple of weeks of shaves out of one (and I have a real beard, not the pussy bears of the girly-men on TV ADs).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But these Persona blades are just awesome.  I&#x27;ve found that I can get more than 2 weeks out of a blade if I open the razor and dry/clean the blade after use.  And they give me a better shave than the Mach III blades that cost what, 5 bucks each?  One hundred Persona blades at the same cost as 5 Mach III blades, and the Persona last longer and are a better shave?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only negative here is that it is harder to shave my upper lip with a safety razor than the Mach III.  This took a little getting used to.</li>
    <li> Exceptional blades at an amazingly low price.  Very sharp and forgiving at the same time.  My favorite blade of the ten I have tried including Feather and Merkur.</li>
    <li> Great Price! And they&#x27;re pretty sharp. These are just what I need it for! Highly recommended for someone who needs affordable blades.</li>
    <li> Was surprised when I got these. With so many positive reviews I figured the 1 stars were just dumb people. These are some of the dullest razors I&#x27;ve used. If you don&#x27;t have really coarse stubble you&#x27;ll have to shave against the grain to get them to cut hair. I used about 5 of them and then tossed them out.</li>
    <li> very good product was fast shipping</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t cut myself yet.  I shave every other day and manage three shaves per blade.</li>
    <li> With the cost of mens shaving supplies on the moon I decided to go back to a safety razor so I bought a Misake Butterfly Long Handled Razor made in Japan and of  excellent quality and very affordable.&lt;br /&gt; These Personna Blades are MADE IN AMERICA and for allot less money than the modern bonded blades I get a nice comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> Perfect blades for my slow beard growth.  While I could shave every day, sometimes it just isn&#x27;t necessary.  Very forgiving blades when used on my Merkur.</li>
    <li> Not the sharpest blades I&#x27;ve used but they provide a good shave for a week.  I have light whiskers so YMMV.  I think the material resists corrosion better than some of the imports I&#x27;ve use.</li>
    <li> And do a good job of it. I use this in tandem with a Merkur Model 38 Hd Classic &amp;#34;Barber Pole&amp;#34; Long Safety Razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get a great  shave for life on the cheap! Buy these.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I got so many razors for the price I did, they shave great, definitely sharper than my old Merkur razor blades were and I will definitely buy another pack next time I need more new ones.</li>
    <li> I have tried to like these blades but I&#x27;m lucky to get two good shaves out of them. Mine came with the blades wrapped in white paper, not the blue that is showing here. With all the hype I&#x27;ve heard about these blades I&#x27;m beginning to wonder if I got something different than was advertised. Who knows, maybe my beard is a little too coarse for these blades. The Astras seem to work much better for me. Anyway, I probably won&#x27;t buy these again.</li>
    <li> Definitely a good value. I like these Personnas  better than the Derby blades they replaced. The blade quality is more consistent, with fewer duds that have a dull, ragged feel to them.</li>
    <li> Gives a good, close shave for less.</li>
    <li> Just started DE shaving earlier this year so I&#x27;m still a DE newby but I love these blades. These will probably last me 3+ years for under $12 since you can get at least 4 shaves with each blade.</li>
    <li> Not in the same universe as Gilette&#x27;s Silver blue. Do not provide a smooth shave and forget about using it more than one time.</li>
    <li> What can I say about a sharp piece of metal except I take hot steamy showers and keep the box in my medicine cabinet. When I pull out a new blade it is not oxidized like some others I have had. I get about 10 shaves out of each razor before I swap for a new one.</li>
    <li> Good blades. Made in America. Seem to work as well as Astra or Shark blades that I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
    <li> Not a great blade. But, as I have found, everyone has a preference. This just isn&#x27;t mine.</li>
    <li> I purchased this set along with my safety razor.  Having a 100 blades will definitely last me most of a year.  Definitely better financial option compared to cartridges.  I did not compare with other blades but these seemed to be what others are using.</li>
    <li> Good quality and well priced razors.  The blades are sharp and durable.  I would recommend trying the razors for a smooth shave.</li>
    <li> I would buy this product again … Very pleased!!!</li>
    <li> Just MY personal opinion but I believe the Wilkinson Sword blades are sharper.  Your mileage may vary.  Not that these won&#x27;t give you a good shave, and they&#x27;re a terrific value.</li>
    <li> these blades are average  at best.nothing against the  seller.my beard is just too much for these blades.i will try something else soon.</li>
    <li> these are great blades. They&#x27;re a wonderful value. When paired with my Krona they provide a smooth, and easy BBS shave every time.</li>
    <li> In a single word, excellent!</li>
    <li> These blades go a long way. I am still on the first one in the pack, and it keeps cutting and cutting! Will definitely order more.</li>
    <li> I really feel that there is no better double edge blade out there. Don&#x27;t believe all the hype about the Feather blades. Price is excellent results are great.</li>
    <li> this are really easy on the skin and shave great.  No irritation.  Each blade lasts about a week.  may gt for something sharper next time, but these are great for getting the hang of a safety razor.</li>
    <li> We bought the old fashioned razor on TV that uses these blades. The blades are very expensive in stores. This box was so inexpensive, I was sure the blades would be very cheap. Not so. My husband uses his razor every day and only changes the blade once a week. A great value</li>
    <li> Very sharp DE razor blade.&lt;br /&gt;I have blades I like better but my wife uses these exclusively.&lt;br /&gt;She commented that they didn&#x27;t work, but the shave was so smooth she just didn&#x27;t notice it was working as expected...</li>
    <li> Pro:&lt;br /&gt;Cheap, good, last long, sharp, nice packaged, easy to take out, I recommended to others.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Not provided with packet to dispose used razor&lt;br /&gt; the razor sharp as the one cost more.</li>
    <li> they are too sharp I seriously cut my finger had 98 stitches and I think I am going to lose feeling in my finger, otherwise will not buy it again because also if you have pimples on your vest will cut it sharply, not smooth all!</li>
    <li> that, and they deliver a pretty good shave are why I purchase them.  I only use them a couple of times.  So that boils down to 6 cents a shave.  I might buy a pack of Merkur razor blades someday . . .</li>
    <li> These little guys are great. They give me the best shave out of all the blades I&#x27;ve tried. My beard is a little courser and tends to grow in crazy directions, but with my safety razor there&#x27;s no problems.</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;ve tried merkur and derby and these by far are the best. The price sharpness and edge retention seems unbeatable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve done 5 days on one blade with 5 face shaves (1 pass with the grain) and 3 head shaves (2 passes with the grain).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With my merkur 33c and a derby blade by day 3 I&#x27;m getting a lot of tugging with that usage and on 4 and 5 a lot of pain with the tugging around my chin. With the personna blades by day 5 they are just starting to dull and pull around the chin but can go strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a merkur 37c these blades slice through hair with no resistance and no pulling. By day 5 there is still no pulling and if they weren&#x27;t so cheap you could probably go for another week. The derbys did well in a 37c after 5 shaves as well, however based of the 33c I can tell the personna hold their edge a lot better.</li>
    <li> Husband likes the blades</li>
    <li> Much sharper and smoother than the Derby&#x27;s that came with my razor.  I get about 6-7 shaves before I start to notice them getting dull.  You could stretch it longer but for the price, why?  My neck is much less irritated than when I was using can gel and a Mach 5.</li>
    <li> Got into the DE razor culture after getting my head shaved by one at a local barber. Used a Merkur 34c with a newly received untested pack of Personnas, and prior to this, I was using the Van der Hagen brand stocked at Wal-Mart (an average German razor experience with no frills, but gets the job done). The shave was different, smoother with less tug and burn, and it is enjoyable. I can&#x27;t say for certain how many shaves I get from each razor because my variable of wear is over a wider area (head), so it may only be 2-3 shaves per razor (depending on if I just change after every shave at 13 bucks a box. In the grand scheme of things, it&#x27;s a good set of American made blades that assumingly have a history in razors (hence their foot in the medical field too) which calls for a set of standards and quality I need in a razor. People say day in and day out that everybody&#x27;s skin is different and that every razor suits only a certain face, the truth be told... As long as you buy a commercial product and not one made in a back alley from rusty hammered down nails, you&#x27;ll most likely enjoy the shave.&lt;br /&gt;Another variable is history, if the blades in question have a long history in the razor business, they&#x27;re doing something right and their razors are intended for a general audience instead of the &amp;#34;picky sensitive woman skin many manly shaving snobs complain about.&amp;#34; Technique plays a vital role to shaving too, if you get nicks and cuts constantly and blame the blades, more than likely it&#x27;s you and NOT the blades if others don&#x27;t have the same issues you do (NOT the ones who give negative reviews, of which you get little but it speaks volumes of bias to those without the experience of the blade in question.) Blades are blades, if you know what you&#x27;re doing, you get a good shave with a good brand, end of story.&lt;br /&gt;These blades are good for the price, they&#x27;re not FEATHERS, but then again having the sharpest tool in the shed isn&#x27;t the best sometimes when your dealing withareas close to arteries and there is room for mistakes. These blades shave smooth and that&#x27;s what counts for an enjoyable shave.&lt;br /&gt; Will be making a regular staple of the bathroom arsenal alongside my Astras because the prices allow me to stock up.</li>
    <li> I have tried about 30 different brands of double-edge razor blades and these are hands-down my favorite. They are very sharp but also very smooth. I get no irritation at all from them. I can get 7 or 8 good shaves from each blade, which means that a $12 box of Personna blades will last me about two years.</li>
    <li> I had high expectations based on these reviews and I can&#x27;t say they were met. I have had prior experience with DE blades and in my view, the sharpness is not quite there with this type. It&#x27;s a good blade, actually, but there is a tiny bit too much pull and occasional irritation. Not too bad and I think I&#x27;ll keep using it, but I expected slightly better results.</li>
    <li> Did not have best luck with these. much better are the Israel crystals you can find on amazon also. also made by same company</li>
    <li> These are good blades (at least for my beard, everything I have read suggests this is highly personal).&lt;br /&gt;I have fairly limited experience with other blades, 5 Astra Premium blades came with my Weber razor and I bought a pack of Wilkerson&#x27;s at Walmart.  Besides depending on the beard the razor itself apparently also plays a part in the best blade to use.&lt;br /&gt;The Weber is what I think would be considered an aggressive razor; I rarely cut myself  when I used an old Gillete DE razor even though I had never used a DE before and rarely used even a cartridge razor -normally electrics but the Weber I sliced myself up quite a bit with the Weber especially with the Astra blades the first couple of uses per blade though less the third or fourth use of the blade.  The Wilkersons still cut me some initially but not nearly as badly as the Astra blades but worse for razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;The Personnas gave me a smoother shave than either of the others and less (or no) cuts or razor burn until the fourth or fifth use.  I could use the Astra blades a few more times than the Personna blades but the first couple times on an Astra blade would cut me and not be as smooth of a shave.&lt;br /&gt;As I see many posts about these Personnas being made in the U.S. I will point out that the Weber is a stainless steel DE razor made in the U.S.  It has an Amazon store but I could not find it via Amazon to buy it (at the time anyhow).</li>
    <li> Bought these for my now antique Gillette razor. Tired of buying disposables, went back to the old shaving mug and double edge blades. Arrived quickly, very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Does not give me a good shave. Blood everywhere. Will continue my search for a quality blade.</li>
    <li> Great price and great blades. I get about 3 good shaves out of one blade. Nice!!!</li>
    <li> price is great, work well. They dont stay as sharp for as long as the other brand I use, but these are cheaper. Go for it</li>
    <li> Everything about these blades is absolutely awesome thank you very much I just wish that I could add them to my Subscribe &amp; Save.</li>
    <li> These are excellent blades that provide a close, smooth shave in my Edwin Jagger razor.  They are sharp yet somewhat forgiving and very smooth.  No nicks, cuts or razor burn and I usually make several passes per shave.  I get a week&#x27;s worth of shaves out of one blade (Monday through Saturday), so this box should last me about 2 years.  Can&#x27;t even compare the cost of these vs. the cartridge crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box says made in USA by Energizer.  These may be the only US made double edge blades today.  More guys should dump the foreign-made cartridges and take up double-edge shaving with these fine American made blades.  The cost savings are incredible and the quality of the shave is worlds better.</li>
    <li> Ok. Had to come back and update my review for everyone who sees the cheap price like I did and said: &amp;#34;what a steal!&amp;#34; It&#x27;s not. You get what you pay for... Here&#x27;s why: some of the blades are exelent and can be used for weeks! Some are jagged and dull right out of the box. Most are mediocre and will last a few shaves for someone with a medium beard like mine. Had they all been consistant in quality I would have left my 4 star rating as it was, but since I never know what to expect out of each new blade, I am irritaed with them now and will not repurchase.</li>
    <li> Blades are very sharp and not as brutal as feather blades. Value cannot be beat. 100 blades for 12 bucks. A year or more worth of blades.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve recently returned to this &amp;#34;old fashioned&amp;#34; manner of shaving with a double-edge razor blade, the shaving soap round bar of soap, whipping up your own wet lather with a Badger hair bristle brush.  I love the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  I hear several guys online praising other double-edge blades whose names I&#x27;ve never heard and have no idea how to order them to try;  but with my limited use of the Personna Double Edge Razor Blades, I have no complaints and would not hesitate to order them again;  although it will take me a long time to go through 100 blades.  I rated them a 4 star, simply because I have no idea how they compare to other brands - which I plan to experiment with using once I find out where to order them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the Personna blades.  They give me a nice shave and I can easily get 4 or 5 really good shaves from one blade.  Since they only cost about 31 cents per blade, I don&#x27;t push it past 4 or 5.  I also found that if I use the same side of the razor 2 times before using the 2nd side of the blade, it stays sharper and give me a better shave.  When I clean it after the first shave, I remember the side that I used to shave and face it down on my towel.  This way I can use the same side the next day and then have two fresh shaves left on the opposite side.  Any way that you do it, it certainly beats paying the price for the triple blade Gillette or Schick models that don&#x27;t shave as closely as the Personna.  I recommend these blades.</li>
    <li> I found Personna to be superior to the Feather blades in my Merkur razor.</li>
    <li> love these / great price</li>
    <li> Last blade made in America,by luck it&#x27;s still a good blade.Personna  has erratic boxing and labeling,avoid the &amp;#34;barber&amp;#34; blades that have printed arrows on the blades,a lousy blade.Problem is ,the good blades,without arrows ,are sold in boxes as pictured here,which depict the &amp;#34;barber&amp;#34; blades...</li>
    <li> i am 81 years old and these blades are as good as any blade that i have used and i have tried a few blades in my life time</li>
    <li> These have worked out okay, but as other reviewers have stated the feather hi-stainless double edge blades feel smoother.</li>
    <li> Great razor blades.  Very sharp, but also quite smooth.  One of my favorite blades and when you can get 100 blades for close to $10 shipped that&#x27;s a huge bargain.</li>
    <li> Excellent blades, so much better than the ones that were included with my safety razor purchase.  Very happy that they are still made in the US.</li>
    <li> These have become my favorite everyday shaving blades, they are sharp yet smooth and provide a comfortable, close shave consistently.</li>
    <li> For the price this is a great deal.  I purchased for a gift so I do not have a performance rating.</li>
    <li> I remember the Personna brand when I was growing up. The blades are made in the USA by an American company that&#x27;s been in business over 135 years. Great value on 100 razors. I use a new one every day for a close shave. You have to be careful when you first start shaving with the double edged razor. It&#x27;s so sharp and more of the cutting edge is exposed then on many other razors. You can cut yourself if you get in a hurry. I know I had quite a few mishaps before I learned how to hold and guide the razor. I love the double edged razor and will definitely buy more of the Personna double edge razor blades.</li>
    <li> I only use these blades as they give me the best results. Not all blades are good. These are super!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t mess around and bought 100 blades with my merkur 1904 razor.  Haven&#x27;t tried ant other blade and don&#x27;t intend to.  These work just fine and I change them on Sundays. Highly recommend them!</li>
    <li> There razors.  They are sharp and the individual packaging takes a little time to unwrap in the morning hence only four stars.  I would recommend some other type of packaging or wrapping.</li>
    <li> Great deal on these. I have a few cases of feathers and these are certainly not as sharp but they are good enough to do the job. I switch them out every two or three days to get the best shave out of them.</li>
    <li> These shave better than any of the half dozen or more other blades that I have tried.  I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
    <li> These are really great blades. I haven&#x27;t been this impressed since I tried Feather blades which cost much more. These are very smooth as well as very sharp. I like the fact that they are made in the U.S.A. since not much is these days.</li>
    <li> I mount these razors in an ordinary Merkur DE. I shave both my face and my head and have fair, soft beard and hair. I get 3-4 face shaves (two passes, with grain) and one head shave (one pass, with grain) before I have to throw the blade out. You may get more shaves out of the blades depending on how course/dense your beard/hair are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are recommended razors on all the vintage shaving forums as good beginner blades because they aren&#x27;t as unforgiving as some other blades. I would agree that this is a low-nick blade if you are new to wet-shaving of any kind, but the nick-nervous forum posters sensationalize the &amp;#34;dangers&amp;#34; of wet-shaving IMHO. These razors are definitely VALUE blades. They are a reasonable balance: they are cheap and sharp, but they don&#x27;t last very long and when their edges go, they GO.</li>
    <li> I find these blades to be just a bit sharper than the red Israeli Personnas. I tried out one, and it gives a comfortable shave. At this price I can afford to replace them every three shaves. The box is very small. Looks much bigger on the web page. Good product at a good rpice, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Nice and sharp. These blades are some of the sharpest I&#x27;ve used. Feather is still the best blade in my opinion but for the price and sharpness they are the best for value.</li>
    <li> These double edge blades are very sharp. I think they are one of the best blades on the market. I wish they were packaged better to get new blades out of the box.</li>
    <li> I purchased these blades to use on my Merkur Safety Razor.  They fit perfectly and they are incredibly sharp. A blade typically lasts me 3 shaves per edge. That&#x27;s 6 shaves per blade or 600 shaves per box.  $14 for an almost two years&#x27; supply of quality blades is a good deal. I definitely recommend them.</li>
    <li> These blades provide a close shave and with 100 in a pack, I shouldn&#x27;t need to purchase more for the next 2 years or so.</li>
    <li> I just started shaving with a DE shaver and bought Wilkinson Sword blades because that is what I remember my father using.  I have not been completely happy with the results but until I tried these Personnas, I didn&#x27;t have anything to compare them to.  These are fantastic! It takes way fewer strokes and my face is feels really smooth without feeling raw.  Especially for the price, these are a new favorite.  Your mileage may vary.  I hesitated because I didn&#x27;t want 100 blades but for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong and they are made here in the USA.</li>
    <li> I used these double edged blades  when I started shaving about 60 years ago. I remember using pieces of tissue paper to stop bleeding. I thought these new blades would be different , but I did not experience any difference.</li>
    <li> blades are sharp and great</li>
    <li> Really nice sharp blades. Wonderful price too. Much better than many other similar products at this price point. Long enough?</li>
    <li> Very sharp and priced right!</li>
    <li> 60 days after purchase, razor fell to floor of shower from 3 foot height and broke (brass screw detached from head). Cannot be fixed. As this happened after return period, it&#x27;s now a useless piece of junk. Hence, the review title.</li>
    <li> These things really get me that close shave.  Just don&#x27;t use on your privates.  Stick with the Mach 3&#x27;s for that.</li>
    <li> These are excellent blades.  They are very sharp, and hold their edge well.  These are MUCH better than the chinese crap blades that came with my razor.</li>
    <li> These blades suck! Feels like the blade is pulling my beard out, not cutting it. I can only stand to use them for about 1 shave. The ONLY thing going for them is the price.</li>
    <li> I gave my face 3 weeks to adjust to these blades using a Merkur Futur razor.  WTG (With the grain) was fine but I was unable to shave ATG (Against the grain) without the blade catching.  I started with the least aggressive setting of 1 with the Futur, then 1.5 week two, and finally 2 setting for the 3rd week.  I changed the blades daily to make sure there was no wearing out of the blade.  Eventually, I got a close shave, and ATG was OK, but I could still feel the slightest stubble.  I finally put my old trusted Derby blade in and ATG was flawless, and no stubble whatsoever.  I guess these were just not a good match for me despite other&#x27;s success.  I forgot to mention I&#x27;m using Proraso &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; soap and a badger brush.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried personna, feather and Dorco. These work best with minimal nicks.</li>
    <li> I personally will buy feather blades for my next razors just because my beard is thick but these are great for learning a safety razor.  Very forgiving and get the job done.  You might just find yourself wanting to shave against the grain because they don&#x27;t give a perfectly close shave even after a second pass.</li>
    <li> Careful!! Super sharp</li>
    <li> Give a perfect shave and last me twice as long as the latest 4-5 blade cartridge type.  I am very impressed with these, no need to try anything further, I found my blades.</li>
    <li> These aren&#x27;t the best blades I&#x27;ve ever used and one of the blades I&#x27;ve used so far gave a bit of irritation, but for the price and overall performance, this is very nice!  I love the small packaging and the easy dispenser.  Would recommend to all shavers.</li>
    <li> Good blades, very thin and sharp. However, it might be my beard, but I&#x27;m getting only two close shaves per blade. Price was a driving factor for returning to a one blade razor. Also like the smooth shave of a single blade. These blades do give a close shave comparable or better than a multi-blade razor.  Found these in a local store for almost $40.00. Great value!</li>
    <li> True value purchase. I like the quality of these blades. I have been searching for a blade that has a quality comparable to the Merkur blades that I usually buy. Although they don&#x27;t seem as sharp as my usual blades, these are still quality razors that I will be buying in the future. The packaging indicates that the blades are 25% sharper than before. Having not used them prior to this change I can&#x27;t say if this is an improvement over their older blades but I can assert the quality of the newer blades.</li>
    <li> fit in razor just fine and shave is o.k. too.</li>
    <li> I mount the Personna Double Edge Razor Blades in a Parker 99R (and a Merkur 180R upon occasion).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that the Personna pulls less than the &amp;#34;Shark&amp;#34; blades which came with the Parker razor.  However you may wish to purchase a smaller package of the Personna blades before getting the package of 100.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Razor blades, like razors, are highly individualistic and what works for one person may not suit another person at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me the Personna blades do not pull nor do they irritate my skin; they leave a smooth path behind them - although I do make two passes (once with the grain of my beard, the second pass against the grain) to get the smoothest shave possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a &amp;#34;cost per blade&amp;#34; basis the Personna blades are, of course, less expensive than the &amp;#34;disposable&amp;#34; razors or the &amp;#34;multi-blade&amp;#34; razor blade heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 100 blades come individually wrapped in a cardboard box; nothing fancy but it works.  There is no provision for discarding the blades (that is, there is no storage space in the packaging to store used blades).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended, with the provision that not all beards are created equal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jim</li>
    <li> Works good  great price</li>
    <li> Best blade I have tried and I have tried  them all, sharp but not too, holds their edge through many shaves that&#x27;s why I bought 100.</li>
    <li> Blades are too thin; not a very close shave.</li>
    <li> Works great with my perfecto double edge safety razor.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve recently converted to the DE shaving system.  I&#x27;ve gone from the \\&quot;big boy\\&quot; money wasters on blades (Schick, Gillette, etc) to electric shaver, the straight edge and now, finally, I think I&#x27;ve found the system that not only works...it is economical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are these blades sharp?  Of course they are.  But sharp is relative when it comes to razors.  How sharp do you really, really need a razor?  I still have to shave every day (excluding weekends) so about the only nice thing for me would be to get an amazing shave that would allow me to skip a day.  Which I&#x27;ve yet to achieve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My razor is the feather one, which shipped with 2 feather replacement blades.  Those blades each lasted for 2 shaves.  The first one was super smooth with no nicks, the second one left me with a few small cuts, the third was more cuts so I learned that 2 was the limit for the feather blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These blades also last for 2 shaves, but I end up with more nicks on the 2nd shave than the feather.  Still tolerable mind you, but that is one of the reasons I think Feather blades are still sharper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get me wrong.  My beard growth is laughable...I couldn&#x27;t grow one if I tried.  I can&#x27;t even get a goatee to connect from upper lip to chin.  So I&#x27;m a little surprised both blades only last 2 shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have learned to truly appreciate the \\&quot;art\\&quot; of shaving now.  Kind of like the show Queer Eye for the Straight Guy.  Those dudes were always appalled at the guys when they shaved..because we tackle it like mowing the lawn...fast and furious.  A word of warning under the DE systems...you do that, and you will lose a lot of blood.  What used to take 2 minutes to deftly swipe my face clear of stubble with a safety razor, now takes 5 to 7 minutes.  I&#x27;ve learned to relax and almost get a Zen like feeling when the razor slowly \\&quot;crunches\\&quot; away my stubble.  The increased time, now forces me to shave at night instead of the morning.  I don&#x27;t mind that all and since my beard doesn&#x27;t grow back really fast, it will hold up throughout my day in time to get whisked away again at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing about these blades is the price.  If I can get 2 shaves per blade, with 100 blades I can go for 200 days.  Throw in my vacation time and weekends and you know what?  For $13, I have blades that will last me close to the entire year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s what I love the most about these blades.e my beard doesn&#x27;t grow back really fast, it will hold up throughout my day in time to get whisked away again at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing about these blades is the price.

    <li> Very impressed with the precision and sharpness of these blades</li>
    <li> I am quite pleased with the price and value of this product.  I have now switched from the five blade expensive blades to a single double - edge blade for a great shave.</li>
    <li> Great way to save money on razors.</li>
    <li> The Blue Box Personna Blades seem just about perfect for me with my new 570 Merkur Adjustable Razor. The funny thing is the Red Box Personnas must be sharper and way to sharp for my beard I used one of the Red Box Personnas and my face looked like I fought a Bob Cat but the Blue Box is just reight for me</li>
    <li> blades don&#x27;t last long</li>
    <li> Close shave and lasts for 5  or 6  shaves</li>
    <li> Great blades but no way as sharp as the feather hi-stainless platinum. Of course they are a lot cheaper than the feather also. Overall a great blade.</li>
    <li> Great blades at a great price in a great box. Not quite as sharp as Feather blades but close enough.</li>
    <li> Economical. Sharp. No nicks. These work like you&#x27;d hope, and they&#x27;re USA made, too!</li>
    <li> Very good product and a better price !!!</li>
    <li> Awful. Dull and low quality. I really wanted to love these blades since they are made in America but I was SORELY disappointed.... pun intended. I have used Astra for a few months and wanted to try something new. No reason to try something new but that&#x27;s just the way I am. These Personna left me EXTREMELY irritated even after using alum and Prorasso after shave. I now have 99 blades I will more than likely never use.</li>
    <li> My favorite blades these blades will never let you down. Stock up!</li>
    <li> All I can say is wow these blades are better then feather blades. Cut very nice and close did not aggravate my skin. And was shipped very fast thank you</li>
    <li> Gives me the best shave of all the blades I have tried!</li>
    <li> These are some of the best razor blades I&#x27;ve ever used.  These blades are not too aggressive, and it is easy to avoid nicks with a good shave cream.  At the same time, they can cut hair very effectively, and they hold an edge for several light shaves or two heavy shaves.  Packaging is simple and effective - paper wrapping and a cardboard box, both of which are recyclable - and the product is made in the United States.  (Good for people who prefer domestic manufacturing standards or concerned about the environmental impact of their razor) Highly recommended for all safety razor users.</li>
    <li> Wanted to like them given price and being made in the U.S.A.  Tried about a dozen.  Finally gave up on them.  They are painfully dull.  Feels like each hair is being ripped out.  Going back to my feathers, which are so sharp it feels like the hairs are being wiped off my face with a soft cotton cloth...</li>
    <li> What a great price on these blades. I have used Personna blades for years only finding them in packaged size of 5 blades.&lt;br /&gt;I was glad to run across this box of 100 and at such a great price.&lt;br /&gt;I love the old Double Edge Razors and with these blades I get the perfect shave every time.&lt;br /&gt;Its too bad the younger generation doesn&#x27;t know what these blades are for and know only what is sold to them in the over priced new style razors.</li>
    <li> The Personna blades are great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a Mehaz safety razor, the same kind I learned to shave with, after being sick of the mediocre shaves from 4 and 5 blade cartridges (I&#x27;m looking at you DSC, Gillette, Schick).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paired the Mehaz with Personna blades and was a little nervous at first, flashing back to a teenage me with lots of t.p. on his face.  I was pleasantly surprised when I came away from my first shave without a nick.  I did take my time and was amazed by the closeness of the shave from a single blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if you change the blade after only 3 shaves, it comes out to costing you about 3 cents a shave.&lt;br /&gt;Try one, but go slow, use a good shaving cream or lotion and rinse the blade often.</li>
    <li> super sharp, even after 2-3 weeks of shaving 4-5 times a week.  great purchase and of course, made in america!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these blades for about 5 months and I can get about 2 weeks of daily shaving out of each one.  Very close shave and an incredible value.</li>
    <li> I have decided to go mainly with a double edge razor but needed good blades.  These are sharp and last well.  There aren&#x27;t many places to buy this kind of blade, and the price per hundred make these blades a double bonus.</li>
    <li> Used to use disposable razors that gave a mediocre shave and took up lots of space.  Multi-blade shavers are not worth the high prices they charge.  Gives a better shave than the disposables.  Just have to be more careful about nicks than with the disposables.</li>
    <li> 11/9/2014    Now that I&#x27;ve been using these, and tried many other blades, for quite some time, I have to say these are the best, at least for my face and facial hair. These get the job done with very little irritation.     Original Review    I&#x27;ve tried a few different blades now, and these Personna are either 2nd or tied for first with Feather in my opinion. The feather give me a somewhat better first shave, but these give me a much better third shave, and are cheaper. So I&#x27;d recommend the Feather if you&#x27;re a one and done, but if you keep your blade for awhile these may be the better option. And don&#x27;t get me wrong, these are pretty darn good on the first shave as well - better than the Darbys I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Left me with hundreds of little cuts.  After the first time, the whole box went into the trash.&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation?  Avoid!</li>
    <li> DE shaving felt like a chore with my previous blades tugging and pulling at the stubble, especially in the chin area!  But that all changed when I opened up my first personna blue blade!  The quality is absolutely fantastic!  With just two passes, with and across the grain, all the stubble was completely gone!  PERIOD!  It was as if a magic force of comfort just whisked away the hair with little to absolutely no irritation whatsoever!  At certain points it didn&#x27;t even feel like I was shaving!  Gillette can keep it&#x27;s ProGlide crap any day!  I got personna!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the record:  I have been DE shaving for over two years now.  I have a decent technique as far as I am concerned and I use William&#x27;s hard soap to lather.  My beard growth is neither sparse nor heavy, but the individual hairs themselves are thick.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used feathers and derby&#x27;s for years now; they swing a wide pendulum between too sharp (extra knicks with little effort) to not sharp enough (not enough effort or extra techniques e.g. blade buffing and you won&#x27;t get a baby-butt-smooth shave.) These sit about in between, I give them a four though because I personally love the bluebirds more.</li>
    <li> Love these blades, I have used them in 2 different safety razors.  The do not cut me like the Shark razors do.</li>
    <li> They seem alright. I haven&#x27;t made up my mind yet on them. But from what I can see they are not bad. There&#x27;s an old saying &amp;#34;you cut yourself more on a dull blade then a sharp one&amp;#34;. I wouldn&#x27;t say they are the sharpest blades. I was disappointed in them since so many people said they where a close second to feather. I don&#x27;t see it like that but they are still not bad and shave well. I think out of personal experience that Astra SP are sharper and last longer but iv used well over 200 Astra&#x27;s and only about 3 of theses. I&#x27;ll give it a few more weeks and if I&#x27;m impressed I&#x27;ll update the review to a 5.</li>
    <li> Sharp and economical. I can shave for a year for less than it costs for one pack of mega-blade cartridges. And the shave is just as close if not closer. Never going back to the mega-blades.</li>
    <li> I was reasonably impressed with the Personna blades.  I have used other brands too and think these do an adequate job for their price point.  Good deal on 100 of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used Feather, Astra, Merkur, Sharks, really find that most of the known brands are very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like that Personna is still an American made product so with that in mind, I did buy them and try them.  Good overall experience for me!</li>
    <li> Sharp, smooth shave.  I do change the blades after every three uses.</li>
    <li> You cannot beat the price. I would put these blades side by side with German blades.  If you have a super tough beard you can figure four to five shaves with one blade. Figuring cost at .15 a blade these are very economical.</li>
    <li> These are good quality.</li>
    <li> I just recently purchased my first double blade safety razor and it came with one blade.  I wanted to try a few blades out and this pack was pretty cheap and they are Made in the U.S.A.  That&#x27;s a rare find these days.  They came packaged well and fit my razor nicely.  I did one shave this morning and they seem to be very sharp and didn&#x27;t cause my any issues.  Way cheaper than my old Gillette razor with 4 useless blades.</li>
    <li> Some brands are so sharp that they take no effort at all to remove hair, but can cut your face if used with too much pressure.  Some brands are so dull that they pull as many hairs out as they cut.  Personna has an unusual combination of pulling hairs our while at the same time slicing my face to ribbons.  It&#x27;s really the worst of both worlds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most brands are better than these in almost every way.</li>
    <li> Great item, love it. No need to buy every 2 months,  cheap and affordable. The razornis great too, love it</li>
    <li> Sharp and they last enough said</li>
    <li> Very good quality, they hold their edges about a week. which is what I expected. Great blades.</li>
    <li> Excellent shave. Great price</li>
    <li> Very good blades does the cut.</li>
    <li> An excellent value.  I&#x27;d give it five stars but it has no provision for used razor disposal.</li>
    <li> Personna double edge razor blades work great. They are all nicely individually packed and are very sharp, can get a couple shaves from each blade. I&#x27;m very satisfied for the price and the quantity. I wont be needing to order anytime soon because of the 100 count but when I do I will re-order these same ones if available.</li>
    <li> Nice smooth shave with no irritation and no cuts. Used in a 1950&#x27;s vintage Gillette 3 piece safety razor. Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> Good razors that will give you a good shave for about a week for those with a heavy beard.</li>
    <li> Awesome product and very sharp blades with a great shave</li>
    <li> Nice set of razor blades. I&#x27;ve always heard Personna blades to be of high quality, so I checked these out. Perhaps I should have gone for the med prep blades, which is where I now notice most of the hype of Personna has been in the wet shaving community. Overall, these blades give me decent shaves. I don&#x27;t tend to use the blade for multiple shaves, as I shave my whole head and my scalp hairs tend to dull blades too much.&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I don&#x27;t see the difference between these blades, the Astra SP&#x27;s I originally started with, or the Derby blades a friend gave me to try out.&lt;br /&gt;Not to say they were bad, but I might look to the Med Prep when I next purchase a Personna product.&lt;br /&gt;Also, shipping was fast and the packaging was pretty good.</li>
    <li> These blades saved me. I started DE shaving with Derby blades and got irritation and ingrown hairs alot on my neck (lower neck). For some stupid reason I kept using them because I had a pack of 100. Around halfway through the pack I had enough of it and changed my shaving cream, prep, and post shave. Most of the irritation and ingrown stopped but there were still few. Finally I finished the 100 blades of Derby after 100 days of shaving (new blade each shave), and bought these. They glide over my skin and I feel no drag or irritation at all. I know Derby is supposed ot be a &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;forgiving&amp;#34; blade but maybe it&#x27;s too dull for my somewhat coarse hair but sensitive skin. I love these. I&#x27;m in the military and have to shave and these get me close enough to BBS and no irritated red neck and bumps.</li>
    <li> **Everyone&#x27;s face will react differently to different blades.  This was my personal experience with these blades.  You may have a worse or better experience using them.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently made the switch from the Gillette Fusion ProGlide to a D/E razor system to save on cost.  After the two razors that came with my Feather razor became dull, I bought these blades.  These blades are very sharp!  This is usually a good thing except for people that have very sensitive faces like I do.  The first couple of shaves using each of the blades resulted in considerable irritation on my neck.  Shaves 3 and 4 were much better after the blade had dulled some.  If your face can handle it, I would definitely go with these blades because they offer an extremely close shave.  If you have a sensitive face like me, I would probably go for a slightly duller blade like the ones from Derby.  The quality of these blades is top notch however, and I love the fact they are manufactured in the USA.</li>
    <li> they&#x27;re working for me, as in, they cut my whiskers. they don&#x27;t seem to be the sharpest double edge razors out there, but then again, I haven&#x27;t gashed myself yet, so maybe that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
    <li> New to the DE shaving, but used these a few times and they give a great shave.  No nicks yet, and a close shave.</li>
    <li> These blades are the best bang for your buck . I&#x27;ve tried at least 10 different brands some I like better than others none of them have been horrible. My favorites have been the feather, Wilkinson sword and rapira Swedish stainless. Then I tried to Personna medical blades in the Personna blue blades. I find no difference between the two Personna blades,. for the price you can&#x27;t beat the blue blades. So once I use up all these blades that I&#x27;ve accumulated the blue blades will be the ones I buy. I use the blade in the Italian barbers baby smooth razor and get at least four smooth shaves with each blade.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> My personal favorite blade. If you shave everyday this 100 pack will last over a year easily.</li>
    <li> They are sharp...and they shave your face like a boss.</li>
    <li> I normally shave with Personna Reds. In either haste or, let&#x27;s face it, drunken online shopping, I clicked on the Personna Blues instead. When they arrived, I figured I&#x27;d give them a shot. Smoothest, most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever had. More comfortable than Crystals and almost as sharp as Feathers. I&#x27;m never going back!</li>
    <li> Excellent blade, fits my skin perfectly, and Made in the USA!  May not be a fit for everyone, but recommend giving them a try.</li>
    <li> New safety razor user as of about a month now.  My new Edwin Jagger 89 DE razor came with 5 Derby blades, and I decided to give these a try, since they are made in USA and a good value.  They are sharp and I usually get about a weeks worth of shaving, 4-5 shaves.  I have a medium thickness beard.  Although not platinum coated, they are smooth and require little pressure to work well without any nicks.  Use three passes and have not had any ingrown hairs with reduced issues in &amp;#34;trouble spots&amp;#34;.  Personna&#x27;s will be my go-to blades going forward as there&#x27;s no reason to switch, barring  price increase or decrease in quality of course.</li>
    <li> I really like these blades. I am getting very close shaves with them using a Parker 99R razor. I haven&#x27;t tried to stretch them for maximum number of shaves yet, but three or four shaves is no problem. They are reasonably sharp and reasonably gentle on the skin. I am a new wet shaver, so I have only tried these and Shark Super Chromes. I prefer these to the Sharks by a significant margin. They are much less harsh. I&#x27;m not saddened to have a hundred of these bad boys kicking around.</li>
    <li> These are the best razors I&#x27;ve found for the money. I have some Feathers and Derby&#x27;s, but I like these best. They seem to be the longest lasting of the bunch.</li>
    <li> I got these with the Merkur Classic Safety Razor and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I cook professionally and need to be clean-shaven every day, so just from a financial standpoint, these are great, but they last me about a week even with my really thick facial hair, so I&#x27;m saving literally hundreds of dollars a year by leaving my Mach 3 Turbo behind.&lt;br /&gt;It took a little adjustment in technique, but pretty quickly I was getting the smoothest shave of my life.  Definitely worth the investment.</li>
    <li> These last a few shaves for me.  Haven&#x27;t tried any other razors...no need to.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price for 100 blades. I forgot how great it was to shave with a double edge razor. I actually enjoy shaving now. I get 5-6 shaves from one blade, so I should be set for awhile.</li>
    <li> GREAT BLADES WILL BUY AGAIN!</li>
    <li> Great razor to shave with, very consistent. They are also affordable, made in USA, and high quality. My new go to razor.</li>
    <li> Loved these blades. REALLY SHARP</li>
    <li> Only brand I&#x27;ve used, but for what it&#x27;s worth, seems to be a good blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good for 3-5 shaves each, which is a great value. I&#x27;ve used 50 and come across maybe 2-3 which didn&#x27;t feel as sharp as the others on the first shave. They have all fit perfectly square in my Merkur handle.</li>
    <li> works fine with my razor</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research and read a lot of reviews before I picked these blades for husband they are great starter ones. he hasn&#x27;t nicked his self  at all and has used them for a month now. great and a lot for the price</li>
    <li> Personna is the best brand double edge razor blades I&#x27;ve tried. I always get 2 good shave with these blades sometimes more. I have an average  beard and once I learned to use this kind of razor I get a good close shave. These blades save me money! I&#x27;ll buy them again.</li>
    <li> I got these for My hubby for Christmas he loved them! He will never go back to the old razors from&lt;br /&gt;Walmart!!</li>
    <li> These are not lab blues</li>
    <li> If you are like me and have sensitive skin and a tough beard these blades are for you!!! The best blades I&#x27;ve used!!!!</li>
    <li> Wow, just shaved my head and face for the first time with these along with my new Merkur 38hd Classic and this is the closest shave I have ever had. I have always used cartridge razors and I will never go back after this. Beyond just the amazing shave you cant beat the price so yeah I will never ever go back.</li>
    <li> Love these blades especially because they are made in the USA. I switch blades every shave, at this price why not.</li>
    <li> Excellent blades. I use them in a shavette, so I break them in half when still in the paper. Each half lasts me for two shaves, so I should get around 400 shaves from the pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are much better than Shark ones that I used earlier. However, I think they wear out faster than the Shark ones.</li>
    <li> Went retro wish I had before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Blades</li>
    <li> Solid, comfortable blade. Great price!  Will purchase again.  Double edge shaving is the way to go. Great way to start the day with an exhilarating shave - and that comes down to the blade on your face!  Personna blades make it work!</li>
    <li> Originally purchased a sample pack from a local store - I was in the market for a quality but forgiving blade. I wouldn&#x27;t say these bad boys are not going to knick up your face if you&#x27;re not careful, but they are not as sharp as some of the other blades you can buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic quality; I changed them out after two or three shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would purchase again a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> I really like these blades.  They are my go to blade.  I have tried Astra super and derby as well.  I find the personna lasts longer and doesn&#x27;t bother my skin.  ****The packaging changed.  The new packaging does not look like the one in the picture.  Energizer now owns personna and they package these blades in a new box and the blades are wrapped in white paper, not blue like in the picture.  They are the same blades, i have held them up next to the old one, just new wrapping.  This picture needs to be updated.</li>
    <li> Nice and sharp and lasts me a long time.</li>
    <li> This has become my goto DE blade. It&#x27;s one of the best for me very sharp, smooth, great price, and made in the US.</li>
    <li> Awesome blades. Great price. I have tried the Murker blades as well and these blow them out of the water. Well worth it.</li>
    <li> Great blades , nice clean shave , will buy more of these . but it all depends on your prep. before shaving  , I get around four shaves from a blade then I replace it , I have a heavy beard and shave daily , these work for me.</li>
    <li> Great Blades at a Great Price</li>
    <li> I have a nice safety razor, and these work perfectly in it. They last for more shaves than other brands I&#x27;ve tried, and there&#x27;s a lot of them in the box. I won&#x27;t need another box for a while!</li>
    <li> Unbelievably great blades.  I just switched to a double edge razor and love the shave I get with these blades. At the rate they last, I won&#x27;t need another box for at least 5 years. Wow.</li>
    <li> I bought a 100 pack for about $13.  They are sharp (discovered I had previously been using dull blades when I took a long strip of skin off the first time I used these) and they are relatively cheap.  Great blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I learned of these awesome blades from r/wicked_edge.  Thanks Reddit.</li>
    <li> Not sharp.  Took several passes to get what I normally get in one pass with my Derby blades.  Lifetime supply of blades to use on other parts of my body where I would hesitate to use something very sharp.</li>
    <li> I ordered a few different brands of blades along with my DE razor, and these were the best of the bunch. They are consistent from one blade to the next (better than the Astra&#x27;s I received), they are sharp, and my favorite part is they are made in the USA. I think this will be my regular brand of blades moving forward. If you are looking for a nice shave and a US made product, then these are a great buy!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t believe all the money I wasted on Mach 3 razor heads. This is by far the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had and I can use new razors each shave without even thinking about the cost. Never going back to Mach 3 or any other razor of its kind again.</li>
    <li> I was hoping for a better performance from the blades.&lt;br /&gt;That is why I inly gave ti a three rating</li>
    <li> I went through a few sampler packs, and these are absolutely my favorite blades.  On top of that, they&#x27;re made in the US and reasonably priced.  Your face will thank you</li>
    <li> I have been using this blade for a couple of weeks and find it as good or better thank the merkur brand that came with my razor.&lt;br /&gt;I go through one blade a week not because its dull ,  I want a close shave and at this price why not have a fresh blade every week</li>
    <li> Simply..They worked great!  I purchased them as a gift for Christmas and my spouse really liked them. He says they are one of the best he has used.</li>
    <li> These blades seem to be very smooth, long-lasting, and cheap.  What more can I say?  I&#x27;ll never go back to more modern, multi-bladed shaving heads.</li>
    <li> cuts very smoothly and great price. i personally am looking to buy more american goods to support jobs in our country. i know its only razor blades but its a start. if consumers demand made in usa products they will be forced to bring jobs back WITHOUT the need for broken us govt.</li>
    <li> The blades are wonderful, the problem is the shaver. The blade does not project out far enough in the razor. The razor looks great, they could have done better in the design in order to get the job done properly. Personna Blades are GREAT!!! I&#x27;ll be ordering again when we hit on the right razor.</li>
    <li> Once you get past the whole &amp;#34;Ra ra, USA&amp;#34; that comes up a lot from being made in the USA, these are in fact pretty decent blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using them for a while now and they&#x27;re great value for money, last a good week or so for me and don&#x27;t cause me any nicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only drop a star because I don&#x27;t like the packaging, where they come in waxed paper inside a large cardboard box, rather than smaller, individually sealed cartons, meaning the box gets a bit manky stored in the bathroom cabinet with all that steam after a while. Also there&#x27;s no where to store the used blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, great blade and highly recommended.</li>
    <li> My favorite blade. Works great in every razor I have and I have quite a few. Highly recommended. Buy them.</li>
    <li> My husband gets great close shaves using these blades with very few nicks like one a week. He usually does 2 runs.</li>
    <li> Great blade overall, but I&#x27;ve noticed some inconsistent performance.  Seems to get caught on my stubble more than previous Personna blades I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> At 12 cents a blade it&#x27;s worth every penny.  Husband has a heavy beard (quite ofter a 2x a day shaver)and he gets about 2 weeks out a blade. Only problem, we don&#x27;t have the slot in the medicine chest (LOL).  He is very pleased. So am I, I gave all the men in the family safety razors for Christmas 2 years ago when I saw the price of some of these multi-blade razors.  The men are calling me to find blades and now I have!</li>
    <li> Well I want to say something different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First the blades the awesome quality. They are built super sharp and comes with individual white wrappers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, to the 5 blade razor users, I want to say, stay away. It burns.</li>
    <li> Super price point, economical, high quality double edge razor blades.  They give me at least two good shaves on a moderately heavy stiff beard.  I can stretch it to three if I shave every day, otherwise it&#x27;s two.  But come on, 100 blades at this price...this box of blades will last at least 6 months, maybe more.  I am very satisfied with this blade.  Product Highly Recommended.</li>
    <li> look folks, don&#x27;t buy any other blades but Personna - you&#x27;ll get a great product (i have a really tough beard and i can get a week&#x27;s worth of shaves out of a blade [perhaps more if i shave twice])&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;these blades are made in the USA, are priced inexpensively, and packaged securely...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a single box will give you nearly a year&#x27;s worth of shaves if you use each blade three times (quite possible to do)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;want even better American-made double-edge razor blades? get Personna&#x27;s Surgical Prep blades (about a Ulysses S. Grant per 100)</li>
    <li> Still on the first blade. Trying to see how long they last compared to the very expensive multiple bladed. Close shave, using a Merkur. Think the box will last until I&#x27;m.....</li>
    <li> Great blades..... Trash all of your multi-blade new razors and go old school</li>
    <li> Very reliable razor! Precise and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Good quality blades made by Energizer. I&#x27;d give 3.5 starts if I could. These are great for someone that&#x27;s just starting out as they don&#x27;t seem to be as sharp as other brands. I can get 2-3 shaves per blade. After using only Personnas for two weeks, I switched over to an Astra for one day and it was clear that these weren&#x27;t as sharp. After trying many brands, I also noticed that these have the least precise wrappers per blade. Most brands have a precision folded wax paper. Unlike the picture, these have a thicker white paper (like printer paper) that&#x27;s folded over the blade. On the positive side, Personna is one of the only blades that&#x27;s not glued to the paper... making it easier and safer to remove.</li>
    <li> Great razor blades great shave all the time</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product...</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re great.  Very sharp and they last.</li>
    <li> do the job but as sharp as expected.</li>
    <li> First off, these are great blades. I keep them in my 5 blade rotation. I&#x27;d say that they compare favorably to Gillette Silver-Blues.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, if you enjoy these blades, it may be a good idea to snag a couple hundred. Energizer, which owns personna, is seeking to reorganize management. Part of the reorganization involves the closing or selling of four personna plants. Including the Pennsylvania plant which is the last U.S. Producer of double edge razors.</li>
    <li> Great value and received in the time promised</li>
    <li> excellent service a product</li>
    <li> Best razors hands down!</li>
    <li> Not as close as a shave as I would have hoped for. Need to use the Braun electric mid day to keep the stuble down. Super cheap so it gets three stars!</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;m impressed. Good amount of shaves per blade. Little or no drag if using a good soap. These blades live up to the reputation. Also good price</li>
    <li> This feells really good on my skin, I think I&#x27;ll buy this again.</li>
    <li> Very good blades. Great price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a barber and these r rly good Better then most I hav tried</li>
    <li> Almost as sharp as feather blades.  I&#x27;ve used derby&#x27;s, feather, and now the Personna blades.  Feather&#x27;s are overrated imo b/c i can only get 1 shave with them and the 2nd shave results in cuts 95% of the time unless i am extra extra slow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the Personna&#x27;s I get 3 shaves.  Each shave is done w/ 3 passes and maybe a 4th pass to touch up problem areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of the blades i&#x27;ve used, this has the best performance and value.  Its made in USA so that&#x27;s an added bonus aswell.</li>
    <li> Awesome blades.  They glide across my skin just as good as Feather blades in my opinion, only much cheaper.  After trying so many different blades to see which I like best, I&#x27;ve finally found it.  I&#x27;ll be using Personna blades from now on.  My beard is normal, so I suppose someone with a different type of beard might have different results.  Just give it a try and see how you like them.</li>
    <li> I love the shaving combination I have put together. I can now shave daily with a new blade without going broke on disposables. Initial cost for the handle and brush was under $45. Cost per shave with a new razor each day 30 cents. The process is very quick and it gives me personal time to plan on the day ahead. My sons age 9 and 2 like to use the brush to cream their faces on occasion. My wife has even started to use it for her legs! Talk about a win win. Her legs are silky smooth and we do not have to put out money on even more razors and canned cream. The resulting shave is closer with far less irritation than canned cream and disposables. Everyone in the family has come to love this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My shaving kit&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Razor:&lt;br /&gt;Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor&lt;br /&gt;B000NL0T1G&lt;br /&gt;$29.99&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brush:&lt;br /&gt;Perfecto 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush&lt;br /&gt;B00LDYFGFQ&lt;br /&gt;$12.95&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blades:&lt;br /&gt;Personna Double Edge Razor Blades, 100 Count&lt;br /&gt;B0077LAJT2&lt;br /&gt;$13.19&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cream:&lt;br /&gt;Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream Bowl, 5.3-Ounce&lt;br /&gt;B0007MW2ZW&lt;br /&gt;$17.17</li>
    <li> Great Razor Blades, last awhile/</li>
    <li> I just used the Personna blades and theey shave me as close as my old Mach 3.  Best part is, instead of paying $20 for a pack of 5 mach 3 blades, I bought a 100 pack of Personna for a little over $12.  I go through about one a wekk, so that will save me about $200 per year.</li>
    <li> Very sharp. No tugging it glides on face</li>
    <li> Good Blades for the Money</li>
    <li> Hubs loves his gift of a safety razor set. These razors do the job intended. Great buy.</li>
    <li> Great blade especially for use with my Edwin Jagger razor. With Amazon pricing they cost me about 10 cents a week... not too shabby.</li>
    <li> good blades but they dont stay sharp very long.  I like the feather blades better.  Last about 3x as long</li>
    <li> Starts sharp, keeps a great edge, rides smooth with great comfort, great price, great shave, great value, gets yours now!</li>
    <li> Buy these blades and you&#x60;ll never be sorry.  They shave very close and last for many shaves. Use with a well made razor and you&#x60;ll save a ton of money.</li>
    <li> I have tried several blade options, most notably Feathers and these Personnas. I have 3 DE razors, and I mainly use the EJ89, which is fairly mild, and the Muhle R41, which is highly aggressive. I like the Feathers in the Edwin Jagger, and Personnas in my Muhle. The Personnas give you a fantastic shave, and pair well with moderate to mildly aggressive razors. The Feather/R41 open comb was just too much for my skin, but Personna/R41 was shaving nirvana. My closest shave ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a nutshell, this is an excellent blade at a very reasonable price. Buy with confidence.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my Merkur 180 handle and they seem to work just as well as the Merkur blades that came with the razor. My beard isn&#x27;t thick though so can&#x27;t comment if these are best with a heavier workload. With 100 blades these will probably last the rest of this life.</li>
    <li> If you are into DE shaving and want a cheap reliable blade, these fit the bill.  Great if you want a fresh blade each day. The dispenser is compact and actuall an improvement over most if the little DE boxes and sleeves.  If I wasn&#x27;t in love with Silver Blues I might switch to these exclusively.  Much better than Derby ood Astra in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Great blades. I use them in my long handle Merkur. They give a close and comfortable shave! Very forgiving. Hardly ever nick myself. I use each one for two days, once on one side, the next day on the other. Each shave ends up costin me about $.06.</li>
    <li> I bought these blades because first they are made in the USA and secondly because I think they are one of the sharpest and most reliable blade out there.</li>
    <li> These blades are good but I&#x27;ve tried another brand and so far I like them better. Feather blades in a Feather razor. This combo works great for me.</li>
    <li> Excellent price, quality product. Used correctly in a quality shaver these blades will get the job done. Made in America is a good selling point too.</li>
    <li> I purchased these blades for a &amp;#34;double edge safety razor&amp;#34;.  The safety razor and blade combo does not give a close shave as the disposable three and four blade razors.  I suppose it makes sense, since there is only one blade doing the work.  I was trying to find a less expensive way to shave.  I will probably use both.</li>
    <li> I am very happy to still find these blades.  They were removed from a local (nationwide) convenience store;  the item was selling there at a low price. Sort of funnny, the items were cheaper there than the multiedge razors -  so they were removed from stock.  Now by ordering on line, I even get them at a lower price.  The item is of HIGH Quality, and is made in the USA.  I have no problems shaving with these.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality and the price can&#x27;t be beat. Sharpness lasts a lot longer since I&#x27;ve been drying the blade between shaves (take it out and pat it dry - carefully). I&#x27;ve found that leaving water to dry off any blade will make it dull faster.</li>
    <li> First off, I realize that everyone&#x27;s personal preferences and beard growth are different, but I really love the shave I get from these blades. I run them in my trusty vintage Gillette adjustable TTO razor. The main thing that people need to realize here is that traditional wet shaving should be viewed as more of a lost manly art/special treat to yourself and not just a way to save cash over expensive cartridge type razors of today. You&#x27;re supposed to take your time...enjoy your shave. There is a certain amount of \\&quot;pampering\\&quot; involved in this type of shaving routine, and prepping your face is key to any good old-fashioned shave. These blades are perfect in my opinion. Perfectly sharp,smooth like butter and I don&#x27;t have to take 5 passes either. These blades certainly deliver a baby smooth face without shredding it. I easily get a week of shaves or more out of a blade. Actually, these give me such a smooth shave that I can skip a day if I want! Do you want the ultimate proof? Have your lady catch you walking out of the bathroom after a shave with these suckers..all smelling good and the like..and she&#x27;ll run her hands down your face like those old t.v. commercials. (And quite honestly, I&#x27;ve been with mine long enough for her to practically hate me by now and she still notices.)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve pretty much considered Personna blades to be an acceptable alternative to high priced blades for quite a few years. That was when I was using multi blade razors. Since I have wisely returned to DE shaving, I&#x27;ve tried the Personna blades, but prefer the Shark, Astra, Derby, and especially the SuperMax Titanium blades, which are less expensive, last longer, and give me a much better shave.</li>
    <li> Great blades, these blades are the only ones that can actually give me a decent shave other than Feather. I tend to only get 2 shaves each out of them, so they aren&#x27;t very resilient, but then again it might just be bc I have a difficult beard and tough stubble.</li>
    <li> These blades have no equal.  I&#x27;ve tried Feather, Derby, amongst others.  Not only are these blades sharp, but I rarely cut myself.  I&#x27;m not sure how they combine safety with performance, but I&#x27;ve found no rival.  Will never buy another blade.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and work well. Very happy.</li>
    <li> I received the the box with 10 packs missing, 20 individual blades and I will not be shopping or purchase anymore items from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Very sharp, I get a good, close shave.  The blades are also packaged in a very compact box, which is nice.</li>
    <li> Smooth with no pulling! Dry shaves are even smooth!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why anyone would use drug store razor blades again!  I get a close shave with these blades, and the cost per shave is so reasonable!  I change blades about every 5 shaves.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best double edge razor blades that I have found. I have tried a number of blades and gave the Personna blades a try because first and foremost because they are manufactured here in the U.S.A. The quality of the Personna Razor blades is exceptional and the price is far better than some other blades made overseas. And the coating is the best I have found  and it greatly reduces razor burn and the blades are more forgiving when you make a shaving mistake, unlike more expensive brands. I would recommend that anyone give these razor blades a try because I am guessing you (and your face) will enjoy everything as I do about this fine product.</li>
    <li> Great razors.  Better then other brands i used.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price on these.  The blades don&#x27;t last forever, but who cares when you get so many blades in the box.</li>
    <li> Great price, and quality. Save a lot of money shaving this way.</li>
    <li> American made steel, what else needs to be said?</li>
    <li> Tried these in my razor.  Excellent shave.</li>
    <li> As good or better than much more expensive blades.  I use my safety razor daily and these blades have stood the test of time with max time between replacement.</li>
    <li> Terrible, not sharp. Drag and pull... A LOT. Cut up all my chin. Dont buy.</li>
    <li> Ok but nowhere near as good as the personnas that come in the 10ct dispenser which outlast the 100ct many times. The astras are better for me than these.</li>
    <li> I just switched to the two-sided Merker-style safety razor after years using cartridge razors.  After you adjust, its great.  You get a week of shaving out of each razor, so there is about 2 YEARS worth of razors in this package.  From a financial standpoint, you are saving about $20-$40 per quarter going this route.  The blades are sharp and hold an edge for the entire week.  You could probably push them longer, but I don&#x27;t see the point.  The shave is as close as you would like it to be and rivals that of modern cartridge razors.  The coating seems to be immaterial.  You can get a 5-pack of blades at local stores for about $5, so you are winning there too.  I definitely recommend the product and the style of shaving.</li>
    <li> Bought these blades expecting them to be ... Razors. But was I disappointed. After using these blades to shave I still have stubble on my face. I get a much better shave using a plain old Gillette razor. Maybe it&#x27;s just me.</li>
    <li> After reading many reviews, I thought that these were a great choice. I was wrong unfortunately. These are not sharp at all. Do not make the mistake of purchasing them.</li>
    <li> great blades, been using these for a few months now</li>
    <li> Made in the USA! Found them to be sharper than my old double edge razors. I was finally able to use a blade more than just once. And i like how its packaged.</li>
    <li> Awesome blades, could not get a better set of blades (that&#x27;s only my opinion of course).  The reason I bought these blades was because they are made in U.S.A., that&#x27;s  it.  But once I used the first blade, I was amazed at how great they are, this is my first time using this type of razor and I don&#x27;t cut my self nor do I get nicks.  Buy these blades now, don&#x27;t buy Russian, Indian, Pakistan, Mexico.</li>
    <li> These are very nice razors. I tried Derby and Feather before these and Feather was better. I was going to order them but decided I wanted to support US business and bought these instead. I don&#x27;t regret it a bit. I get a better shave with these than the Feathers and less nicks/pulls/irritation. This pack should easily last a year.</li>
    <li> These DE Blades have the quality I expect from Personna.  I used them in the past and then switched to the gimmicky 2 then 3 then 4 blade razors from the &amp;#34;Major&amp;#34; manufacturers. I switched back to the tried and true Safety Razor system which has been used for a century.  Guess what?  The shave is better and is inexpensive. You will save a ton of money. If you are NEW to this having system, then search AMAZON for &amp;#34;THREE PIECE SAFETY RAZORS&amp;#34;,  Don&#x27;t be a sucker, try the Safety Razor system and I bet you won&#x27;t go back to the &amp;#34;Modern, High Tech&amp;#34; RIPOFFs. Do an internet search to learn what you need know.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with these. I use each blade twice. To date, my only comparison blades are the Derby ones that shipped with my razor. They were abysmal things. I haven&#x27;t given a 5-star rating purely as I am yet to try the (in)famous Feather blades and, by all accounts, they are the duck&#x27;s nuts.</li>
    <li> The blades last much longer and shave closer than the expensive multiblade  razors I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
    <li> just okay for me. I recommend getting a sample blade pack first and after trying each make an informed blade saelection afterwards.</li>
    <li> I use each side twice and toss. Starts to get a bit rough the third use on one side.</li>
    <li> Really sharp! Only blades i have used so far and they are made in the U.S. cant beat that. These with my Merkur and and Proraso soap and i got the best shave of my life.</li>
    <li> By no means an authority on blade or wet shaving but bought these for a recently purchased Micro Touch Razor. 1st shave was with the blades that came with the razor. 2nd shave was with these. The difference was night and day so much smoother and not a single nick. Can&#x27;t beat the price Bye Bye Mach 3.</li>
    <li> My expectations were met and am totally satisfied.</li>
    <li> I think my favorite of the vast collection of blades I have. Great price too! Long lasting blade.</li>
    <li> These are the best double edge razors that you can get for that price. Super sharp and smooth on the skin. Just be very careful, because these are very sharp</li>
    <li> Better than most blades!  Plus a great value!</li>
    <li> Great bargain. I just started wet shaving and have been through about 10 different blades from a variety pack. I don&#x27;t remember all of the blades I&#x27;ve tried, but they include Derby, Treet, Astra, Gillette 7 O&#x27;clock, Gillette Goal, Nancet and Blue Bird. I have a Feather that I have not yet tried. I was starting to run out and decided to go for economy. Took a chance on these and have been pleasantly surprised. I have a light to medium beard and these work well. Pretty sharp... pretty smooth. Decided on these rather than the 100 pack Astra because these are made in the U.S. I&#x27;m giving these 5 stars in that they are a good blade (I&#x27;m sure there are better out there) at an incredible price. Works for me.</li>
    <li> Great shave! Top value!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money buying different DE blades. Sampler packs. This blade is the top of the mark! I can use it on my mildest razor or on my most aggressive. I can get anywhere between 2-5 shaves. 2 with the R41 and many more with others. At under 14 per blade it&#x27;s a win win!</li>
    <li> The blades seem plenty sharp and give me a nice shave using a vintage Gillette razor. I&#x27;m getting 4 or 5 shaves per blade.  Not bad at all.  Very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I recently re-discovered shaving with a double-edge safety razor. These are my favorite blades, and they are made in the USA.</li>
    <li> Used with my Merkur safety razor. Quality blades at a reasonable price. I will purchase these again in the future.</li>
    <li> Hi, I switched to the much less expensive way of shaving several years ago.  I love it, and it is indeed much, much cheaper after your initial investment of a nice razor, lather, brush and lather mug.  I love &amp;#34;lathering up&amp;#34;, with the brush and getting a nice (cheap), clean and close shave.  It is criminal what they charge for the disposable blades, they just keep going through the roof in price.  I have tried every razor blade offered on Amazon.  I enjoyed the &amp;#34;sample pack&amp;#34; from all over the world, some blades were great, others mediocre.  When I ran out recently I though I would give these a try.  I am proud to say, without a doubt these are the sharpest, longest lasting cleanest shaving blades that I have tried!  I couldn&#x27;t believe how much sharper they seemed.  I am a customer for life, and that they are made here in the USA, is even more of a sell for me.  They may not work for everyone, but I am sold! Give them a try.</li>
    <li> This was even better for me than the feather, for some reason it works well with my heavy beard. I love that all 100 razors come together in one box with an easy dispenser in the corner.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found my default blades from now on!</li>
    <li> I usually buy my razor blades at the local Walgreens when they have them( 10 blades for under $5.00).  They are not Persona blades either.  I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> These are the only blades I have used so I can&#x27;t compare.  I love them.  What else can I say?</li>
    <li> These blades are the best I have used so far.  I used Derby, Shark, and Dorco, they all tugged and pulled my beard.  The Personnas didn&#x27;t even feel like they were cutting at all, but they were.  No irritation or bumps.  Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> these blades are just right.  Much cheaper than using Mach 3.  These blades also are not too sharp like other DE blades on the market.</li>
    <li> I just started using these razors.  I&#x27;m pretty adept at executing several small cuts per shave.  Given my little experience I can say these are the finest blades known to humanity.</li>
    <li> Great Blades! Sharp, Forgiving,They last a good amount of time and my face is smooth.What else is there to say. Try them and you will like them.</li>
    <li> Good overall. About every fifth one has bite to it. Otherwise they hold an edge and are nice to use.</li>
    <li> Far in smoothness from Feather. I much prefer to buy US-made goods but sometimes you have keep buying Japanese-made to get the quality. Low bar of Solingen&#x27;s Merkur blades is overcome but these Personna blades and for the price is quite good, but if you used Feather DE you will not go back for the closest shave.</li>
    <li> You have made the right choice by choosing the blue Personna blades. I have tried them all and just like most reviews I&#x27;ve read the Feather blade is to sharp for me. Nothing like waiting for that one time that the Feather blade decides it wants to see how pretty your blood is. Personna blue are my favorite and will be forever. Also did I mention they are made in the USA. If the government can&#x27;t keep America working then the people will by buying American made products. Last but not least, did I mention these blades are made in AMERICA!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I really like these blades.  Switched from Derby and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  Worth every penny.  I get about 3 to 4 shaves with one blade (I prefer them sharp).  They do not drag like the Derby blade.  It took me three shaves to get used to them. I will order again.</li>
    <li> 12 cents a blade, 5 to 6 shaves per blade, close shave, sweet</li>
    <li> They do not give one a close shave!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve sampled dozens of DE razor blades from Feather, Voshkod, Derby, Astra, Gillette and Personna.  I keep coming back to these Personna \\&quot;lab blues.\\&quot;  They consistently give a sharp and smooth shave.  No pulling.  No nicks or weepers.  And they last for good five shaves, even more if you&#x27;re not as picky as me about the slightest pulling! You can&#x27;t beat the value of these blades.  About $12 for 100 blades.  At least try them!</li>
    <li> I put this blade to my face this morning and was amazed by the lack of grab and the close shave. I&#x27;ve tried just a few blades so far...merkur, the PX Select brand (I&#x27;m a Army guy), and Gillette. Personna is my new favorite blade! They are smooth!! I just got these yesterday morning, 7/29/2014, so I cant really say if they last more than a couple days or not. I&#x27;m sure they are good for 5 shaves. At 100 blades you will go almost two years. In case you mil guys are curious the PX selects were my previous favorites.</li>
    <li> Not my favorite double edge blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blade caused some irritation from the very first shave - something I haven&#x27;t experienced with Russian made blades like Gillette Silver Blue or Polsilver. YRMV</li>
    <li> Great price and they worked excellent</li>
    <li> One of the finest blades I have used, one of the closest shaves I get are with these blades.</li>
    <li> Excellent blade. Sharpness is perfect for my taste.  I have used this blade with a Merkur Long Handle and several vintage Gillette&#x27;s and it provide a nice shave.  Also feels good knowing you are using an product Made in USA.</li>
    <li> Average blade. I shave twice a day because of tough beard and I can get only two good shaves per blade. By the third shave, the blade pulls badly, neccesitating changing to a new blade. I suppose the blades are as good as expected considering the price, but I will order a different blade costing more and highly rated the next time. I had previously used the Shark and Feather blades with good results over a longer peiod. The Feather is very sharp and I tend to get more nicks with this blade, but worth paying the extra $$ for a better blade, albeit foreign made.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my daily shaving habit! No issues.</li>
    <li> Great quality.  Would buy these again.</li>
    <li> cut so well I couldnt tell there was a blade in the razor</li>
    <li> Nice sharp blade that dropped into my Merkur safety razor. Great shave that is very close. This item doesn&#x27;t have a skin protection coating on each blade, so you might need to use a higher quality soap to prevent mild skin irritation. It is 100 individually wrapped blades so you need to plan ahead if you are on extended travel and would need to replace a blade in the razor.</li>
    <li> These fluctuate a few dollars in price so if you watch them until they drop you get them at an awesome price. Stock up before DE shaving becomes big. These won&#x27;t be perfect for everyone but they are a top notch razor for most. If you&#x27;re not able or not willing to buy sample packs these are a safe 100 pack to start with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~Amazing price for 100 razors&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~Super Sharp&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~Last quite a few shaves for me</li>
    <li> Excellent shave; I&#x27;m getting consistent good shave after two weeks using same blade.  What a bargin</li>
    <li> Only used a few blades so far. I&#x27;m happy with the quality, price and packaging. Bought it primarily because it&#x27;s made here locally and the price is very affordable. I tried Derby before I can&#x27;t tell the difference.</li>
    <li> Blades work great for a great price. Not much else to ask for.</li>
    <li> Just moved to a safety razor to cut down on cartridge costs. I thought these would all the relative equivalent, but turns out it&#x27;s not even close. My new safety razor shipped with a Merkur Super that was great. The Personna felt like I was taking a weed whacker to my face. It wasn&#x27;t even close. After 6 shaves (I shave every few days, otherwise my slow, pitiful mane isn&#x27;t really long enough to cut) the Markur was still sharper than the PErsonna. Guess I&#x27;ll have to spend a little more than  I thought.</li>
    <li> Good quality blades and the price is right</li>
    <li> Affordable and cut so well. Made in USA too!</li>
    <li> I tried these blades in multiple styles of razors, and in every razor I used (with the lightest amount of pressure I could control) it still felt like it was taking off a micro layer of skin.l never got nicks or cuts but the aftershave burn was a lot greater than any other blade I have used. I&#x27;m sticking with astra greens in my aggressive razors and feather blades in my mild ones</li>
    <li> Nice blades.  At this price I can afford to have a new blade each shave even if it&#x27;s not needed.  These are my go to blades now.</li>
    <li> Use to spend a ton of money on cartridge razors. Now I have a safety razor that shaves better than the one I used before plus the blades are really inexpensive. Win Win</li>
    <li> I purchased these to go along with my WEISHI Long handle butterfly open razor.  These blades sit nice and give a very close shave.</li>
    <li> Very good for the money</li>
    <li> I have used about six different blades in the last couple years since converted to DE shaving. I think the Feathers might be the sharpest. I recently bought 100 of these after reading reviews and have to say these are my favorites and they are made in the USA. Use them in Muehle R41, E Jagger and Merkur 34C. What a great product and very well priced!</li>
    <li> The best of both worlds when its comes to getting a close shave yet a comfortable one. These are my new everyday shave blades love em.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in the Marine Corps and we shave every day. I change my blade out every Monday. This kit basically gives you two years of frash close shaves. They are individually wrapped and don&#x27;t rust.</li>
    <li> These are very affordable, very sharp and fit my razor perfect. Definitely recommend these.</li>
    <li> Good blades, and excellently priced!</li>
    <li> I am 44 and have been shaving for a while.  When I was kid I started shaving with a safety razor from there electrics many brands then the latest greatest Gillet what ever.  For the record I have a fine soft beard.  Perhaps that is the problem with these blades.  These just pull the bejeezers out of it.  I tried to like them cause the price was great.  I ended up throwing away 98.  For a soft beard nothing beats the Merkur blades, at least not these Shark, Feather, or Astra.</li>
    <li> Blades aren&#x27;t as sharp as I would like.  Was hoping they were more like the Gillette DE blades...I am not looking for Feathers but something in between and these are definitely on the lower end of the sharpness scale.</li>
    <li> I would pay more for 10 blade dispensers with used blade storage, but I get a great shave with these blades.  I switched from Mach 3 blades because I was a little miffed at how expensive it was getting, but I would not go back now because I like the shave I get now more.</li>
    <li> Last year I received a vintage 1911 Gillette safety razor from a family friend&#x27;s estate, and since it wasn&#x27;t in good enough condition to sell for any significant value, I decided to start using it myself. Soon after, these blades went on sale and, after seeing all the good reviews, I gave them a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One use and I was hooked... this may be the only brand of blade I use from here on out. They shave real close with minimal irritation, and I typically get 3 or 4 shaves out of each blade. Since I only shave once every few days, one box should last me a couple of years. Even at regular price, you can&#x27;t argue with the economics - these are a great buy for anyone interested in shaving with a safety razor.</li>
    <li> Have tried a lot of blades and these are high quality. Finally a blade that wont cut you all up and give you a very close shave. I also have found the old shave cream in a can is better to use than the lather from one of those soap dishes, although I have not tried them all. I am using a safety razor made in England and like it very much. high quality all around. It does make a difference. thank you Amazon and persona for the perfect shave.</li>
    <li> After trying Derby and Feather blades, these Personna have become my go to blades.&lt;br /&gt;They are way sharper than the Derby&#x27;s, whilst not giving me more nicks.&lt;br /&gt;They are almost as sharp as the Feather&#x27;s whilst giving me far less nicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im&#x27; getting 4-5 shaves per blade.</li>
    <li> Very sharp blades that last me two to three shaves when shaving my head.  Highly recommend these blades. Best part they are made in the USA.</li>
    <li> These are some of finest blades I have used. I had to make an emergency purchase at the local drugstore because I had to be clean shaven and they had not arrived yet. They came the last day of the expected window, however that might have more to do with the weather here and that is not an indicator of the quality of product. For the sake of comparison, I spent about $7 for 15 blades at the drugstore. While the blades are of similar quality, the drugstore blades are slightly thicker and far more expensive on a per blade basis. I will be buying these blades from now onward.&lt;br /&gt;Some of the comments about a bad shave from these blades do make sense. If you hop between blades or it is the first time using this style there will be irritation. Please realize a wet shave can be a wretched experience if poorly executed, regardless of blade. Make sure your face is properly prepared before shaving - it is the first step for a reason. Apart from that, these are the best blades that I have found out of about 10 brands that I have used.</li>
    <li> Perfect blades and gives nice, clean shave, and no irritation. I haven&#x27;t tried any other DE blades, but I still recommend this.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s possible that my technique is bad but the first shave on a new blade causes bad irritation idk what I&#x27;m going to do with them now. I&#x27;ve ordered a sample pack with Astras sharks and Derbys. I think Astras will end up being my fit but maybe even duller. These and feather are clearly too unforgiving for my beginner hand and face. Maybe ill be able to work up to them</li>
    <li> Very sharp and decent quality. Not right for my skin though. Smoother and less sharp blades like Derby work best for me. These give me razor burn no matter how gently I shave.</li>
    <li> Shaves good. Not quite as sharp as some others, but for the price well worth it.</li>
    <li> Good addition to the shaver. These blads will last for a long while</li>
    <li> I enjoy these razor blades</li>
    <li> How do I know if I have a tough or easy beard to shave?  I just assumed I was average, whatever that was.  So I chose these as they were in the middle of sharpness from less to more.  You can spend more to get much sharper blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I was new to shaving this way I had to make a guess.  I wish I had asked my barber, because as it turns out he would know, right?  I am light complected with light hair on arms and face.  That does NOT mean I don&#x27;t have a coarse beard.  These blades just don&#x27;t cut it well, and I have to shave twice.  Barber tells me that relative to hundreds of dudes he&#x27;s felt their face that mine is fairly coarse so I&#x27;ll have to find a sharper blade.  I have to use way too much pressure to get these to cut, so next time instead of 100 pack I&#x27;ll order a variety pack to be sure of what type I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blade lasts about 4 shaves, shaving twice each time, before I feel I need to replace.</li>
    <li> Great, long lasting blades.</li>
    <li> Low cost &amp; good shaves.</li>
    <li> Product is what I anticipated. Delivery was timely.</li>
    <li> these are very very sharp and last i keep mine in cocnut oil so they dont rust in the shaver ;)</li>
    <li> as sharp as razors should be, durable too</li>
    <li> I find I&#x27;m needing to replace these blades about once a month. So I paid $14 for the box of 100... which comes out to be 14 cents per blade and will last me 8+ years! That&#x27;s a DEAL!&lt;br /&gt;-Abby&#x27;s DAD</li>
    <li> It did not shave close enough even after repeated shave at same place. The blade i not sharp enough.</li>
    <li> These blades are awesome. They are super sharp and stay sharp longer than other blades I have tried making it a close shave for at least three shaves without nicking. Would differently recommend these blades.</li>
    <li> Love these blades. Can&#x27;t beat the price for these razor blades.</li>
    <li> Great blades. Great price! ! Like wow... this is gonna save me so much $</li>
    <li> GREAT deal on safety razors. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Gave a 5 star rating because my husband is very happy with these blades.  He says they give a him very close shave, as he has a very  heavy beard.  The blade also stays sharp for several uses...  .  The seller was very nice and shipped the blades very fast.  He highly recommends these blades&lt;br /&gt;Ruth A</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried these blades, Feathers and Sharks.  These work very well for me especially after getting the first shave with a new blade out of the way.  I like Feathers a lot as well.  I&#x27;m relatively new to safety razor shaving, but these work very well for me and I shave my face and head almost every day.</li>
    <li> Use these with my MERKUR sledgehammer to shave my head and face to get me that BBS! BABY SMOOTH SHAVE!  They&#x27;re awesome i highly recommend these</li>
    <li> ECXELLENT PRODUCT AND CHEAP!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the blades for over a year now and still haven&#x27;t run out of them.  They give a very close shave but they are more forgiving than other blades out in the market (aka you won&#x27;t cut up your face if your a beginner).  I would highly suggest these to anyone who uses a safety razor.</li>
    <li> Compared to the Gillette Silver Blue, I like the Gillette better.&lt;br /&gt;I have a hundred of these Personna blades and will use them, but I will not be purchasing again.&lt;br /&gt;I have two razors Merkur 180 and Merku 510 adjustable. I will use the Merkur with the Personna to do the whole face and the adjustable to do the stubborn area near my throat using the Gillette Silver blue</li>
    <li> Very good blades for the money. Long lasting if cared for. Why pay more for multi-blade disposables when one blade is all you need, and these stay sharp longer?</li>
    <li> I used derby blades before. I ran out and decided to switch brands. These Personna blades are a higher quality. They cut closer and last longer. I know there are better blades out there like shark or feather, but for the price difference it&#x27;s not worth it. I will be buying Personna for as long as I can. Plus they are made domestically.</li>
    <li> My dad used DE razors when I was growing up.  He passed 2 1/2 years ago and I found some of his old DE razors.  I&#x27;ve been using the triple blade razors for most of my life and decided to give the old fashioned DE a go.  I ordered some of these blades after reading the reviews and I can say, I&#x27;m quite impressed.  I dry shave both my face and my head.  Most of the shaving gel&#x27;s and soaps irritate my skin so I&#x27;ve learned to just shave with out it.  These are sharp enough to give you a good shave and obviously forgiving enough.  Dry shaving definitely takes a steady hand, but my first go with a DE and the Personna blades went without a hitch.  I was a little worried having read how a lot of people who had switched to DE&#x27;s cut themselves a lot the first few times.  Definitely recommend these!!</li>
    <li> These are far better than your local Kroger blades and close to the Wilkinson or Feather blades I preferred before. They do seem to survive fewer reuses, and you ought to dispose of them in some kind of plastic case for the sake of avoiding cutting your garbage man, but this is a fantastic deal for a whole lot of inexpensive but good quality shaving razors.</li>
    <li> Purchased these for my Fatboy &amp; Adjustable Slim and they make these vintage razors shave better than any modern razor I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Durable enough for even a second shave for me.</li>
    <li> These blades are awesome. They did in one pass what took some other blades two or three. Those who are saying they cut themselves quite a bit must not know how to shave with a safety razor. Buy &#x27;em now, thank me later.</li>
    <li> Very sharp. Gives nice shave. I dispose of blade after four or five shaves. Only get razor burn when I use to much pressure on raZor. I am a newbie to DE razors but love it.</li>
    <li> not as good as disposable razors.</li>
    <li> These are the third brand of blade I&#x27;ve tried since moving to DE shaving. The first was Derby, which from what I&#x27;ve read have very mixed reviews from shaving enthusiasts; the second was a blade from Merkur that was included with my Merkur MK030. I was a bit skeptical that there would be much difference between blades, but it seems there is. I noticed that the Personna move through hair with less resistance than the Derby blades, and the Merkur blade was actually so bad that I threw it out half-way through shaving (it tugged at hair). My &amp;#34;technique&amp;#34; is fairly good (it&#x27;s not brain surgery, really), as I&#x27;ve been DE shaving for a couple years. I&#x27;ve heard that different blades can have different results based on the razor it&#x27;s in, the type of face/hair it is shaving, or what have you, so bare in mind that this review is limited to usage in a Merkur MK030 &amp;#34;Bakelite&amp;#34; razor (which I like quite a bit), and is being used on the only face I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not much else to say. They&#x27;re good. I use them about 3 times before replacing, but they could go longer. I just figure for about 14 cents per blade, I may as well not compromise having a fresh/sharp blade each time. They give me a relatively smooth shave with little or no tugging. Oh, and they&#x27;re made in the USA, which I like. I&#x27;m not hardcore about where stuff is made, but if there is an option for something made in the U.S., and the product is quality and competitively priced, I will take that option. The price of these is pretty similar to other blades. Considering how long 100 blades will last, I have zero problem spending a few bucks more for manufacturing integrity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades are individually wrapped, but they are not bundled into little plastic dispensers like the Derby. I like the little dispensers, but really it&#x27;s not necessary and a waste of materials, so I&#x27;m glad Personna does not do this.</li>
    <li> Nice sharp blade would recommend it to a friend cheap price.shipping was fast when you shaver with double edge you will never go back to cartridge late Blades</li>
    <li> This is the best way to shave! the twin blade razors are a rip off anymore!</li>
    <li> I love them! These are great blades, very sharp yet very smooth. I was a dedicated Feather blade user, but these are half the price, almost as sharp (very slight difference), last longer, and are smoother. I use these in all of my shave reviews at: [...]</li>
    <li> This was a surprise gift to a brother-in-law.  He had already decided that this product was his double-edged razor of choice, but rather hard to find.  Surprise worked!  He loved it.</li>
    <li> Works well with my Merkur! Bought such a large pack that it will definitely last at least a year or more.</li>
    <li> Granted this is only the 2nd type of razors I have bought I would have to give these the &#x27;edge&#x27; over the others I have used. Very sharp. Very nice glide I get over the skin. I have heard a few others are a little sharper and I might go with those next time (whenever 100 runs out) but I am a fan of these for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downside is they get noticeably dull/different after about one use. I still can get 3-4 uses out of one but from the first to the second use is a big difference. The first use is just soo nice.</li>
    <li> Met all expectations.</li>
    <li> Just received these blades and they were great. My neck is sensitive and with a traditional Tripel blade cannot shave down without having severe razor burn. I had no problem with these blade shaving down.</li>
    <li> Seem to be made well.  The price is right.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only tried these and &amp;#34;Shark&amp;#34; blades, and these are much, much better for me.  I suspect with anything as personally variable as shaving (beard thickness, direction etc.), your mileage may vary - but I&#x27;ve found these to be good for at least a week of comfortable use and one could probably push them farther.  At $0.15 / blade, the value is remarkable.</li>
    <li> Light, made in USA, and still cheaper than buying razor blade heads or that monthly razor club thing.</li>
    <li> Compared to the trial blade which came with the razor, these are a much better blade. On a par with the throw away Personnas, they  seem to have better life. They are quite sharp and if you are too speedy in your shave, you can garner some nicks, so take your time and tighten your skin in wrinkled areas (if you have them).</li>
    <li> very satisfied with this purchase</li>
    <li> These have worked really well for shaving my face.  They are very sharp and give me a great shave.  I also like that these are made in the USA. The problem is I also shave my head and these have not worked well for that.  Every time I try I end up cutting myself.  I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m doing something wrong or if its the blades.</li>
    <li> I hate these blades.  They are uncomfortable to shave with.  Are they supposed to be for shaving?</li>
    <li> Good blades that work great with my face and my Edwin Jagger DE89LBl.</li>
    <li> Great blades. What I would expect from an American-made product.</li>
    <li> These blades aren&#x27;t as sharp as a feather or Astra, but they ware better and give more excellent comfortable shaves. The price per blade is a bargain, they are made in the USA. These blades will give me 8-10 good shaves. For people who use barber razors or shavettes, this should be your blade.</li>
    <li> My husband was impressed and happy with this shave</li>
    <li> Sharp and smooth.  I use mostly in my Fatip Grande open comb.  I get about three shaves, but I could probably do more.</li>
    <li> I bought these just so I didn&#x27;t have to keep going into Sally&#x27;s Beauty anymore to overpay for a 5 pack of Personnas.  I hate going in there but that is the only place to get these, my Clubman and Jeris.  These blades don&#x27;t seem to be as nice as the ones I get there, but they are still better than others I have tried.</li>
    <li> I get more than 8 days of shaving from one blade.</li>
    <li> Bought a 100 pack about two years ago. I shave everyday with the exception of the occasional Saturday.  I change the blade on Sunday night after a week of shaves and my last shave is as good as my first. Great blades and an even greater bargain.  13 cents a week to shave isn&#x27;t too shabby. I&#x27;ve been using a safety razor for 7-8 years and this is blade I&#x27;ll use them as long as I can find them. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Excellent blades that are perfect for everday use.  They are very sharp and I plan on using these for the forseable future.</li>
    <li> Great blade. I highly recommend this blades. And Amazon service is outstanding.</li>
    <li> If you think these deserve anything more than two stars, you must be new to DE shaving.  Practically a dull blade compared to Astra or a Gillette Super Blue.  Congratulations though, you bought USA made though.  I am now stuck with 90 of these blades, and those I have given away were also rated as crap by my fellow shavers/beer-after-work buddies.  They aren&#x27;t even wrapped for longevity in wax paper, simply packaged in white paper.</li>
    <li> This service is fast. Even with a very coarse beard, I find the blades pretty sharp and smooth. I use them in a Weber stainless steel razor, and in shimmed Gillette Tech 1951 and Gillette Rubie razor. Depending if I shave my head as well, they last me at least 2-3 shaves. So the blades are a great bargain compared to the prices of disposable cartridge razors. The multi-blade carts dull quickly and instead of cutting they tend to tug and pull my stubble out. It was rather unpleasant and painful. No more painful ingrown hairs. I recommend these &amp;#34;Lab Blue&amp;#34; Personna blades, the &amp;#34;Med Prep&amp;#34; Personna blades and all Israeli Personna blades for very dense and coarse beards.</li>
    <li> These blades are dull.  I&#x27;ve used derby, feather,  dorco,  and Astra.  These personna are far the worst I&#x27;ve come across.  I use them for easy neck shaves,  but I don&#x27;t waste my time on face shaves.</li>
    <li> Great American made blades. Prompt shipping. Got two years worth of shaves for 13 dollars. How can you beat that?</li>
    <li> Great value for more than adequate quality !</li>
    <li> These are made in the USA! Not the best shave but well worth it.</li>
    <li> The hairs came off as easily as wiping off nair. It was that impressive.</li>
    <li> The amount you get for the price is amazing. They are just as sharp and leave me with a close shave. This is the first time I&#x27;ve bought this so not sure if they don&#x27;t last as long but from I&#x27;ve read as long as you keep them maintained with mineral oil they will keep a long time.</li>
    <li> Packed nicely for easy use</li>
    <li> its cheaper to use this than the gillette with high prices.</li>
    <li> OK but not as smooth as Astra Super Platinum blades.</li>
    <li> never going back to cartridge razors.&lt;br /&gt; these are great very sharp very smooth liked them much better than derby and dorco</li>
    <li> great quality and very reasonable priced. I really like these blades.</li>
    <li> I read the good reviews on this product so I thought I&#x27;d give them a try.They give a nice close shave and that s why I gave a five star rating.I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure feathers work for great for a lot of folks, and they worked ok for me. I was running low on feathers and stumbled upon personnas and figured I&#x27;d give them a shot. It was a great move. I&#x27;m getting more comfortable shaves and it seems that I&#x27;m getting more shaves per blade. Also, made in the USA. I&#x27;ve tried many different blades in my search for the perfect shave and I&#x27;m pleased to have found one that works really well for me.</li>
    <li> I bought these blades because they are American made, and they truely are great quality. They are very smooth, and very sharp. Smooth &amp; sharp enough to shave as well as your own ability will let them. I highly recommend these.</li>
    <li> Not the Best quality Blade but it was worth the money. I swap blades sooner than I would Feather&#x27;s double edged one but that is okay. Since there is so many of them. It will still last me a long time. Not much irritation just remember to warm up the blade before you shave.</li>
    <li> Does the job. Way cheaper than multiblade razors for shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still have to be somewhat careful but for the price it is a learning curve willing to deal with.</li>
    <li> I switched back to a regular safety razor sometime back and have no regrets. The price of the multiblade packs has got ridiculous, even at Costco they want a fortune. So I have gone back to the future. The price per piece is so low you can use them once and still come out smiling, there are other brands at much lower prices so it&#x27;s worth a look around. It then comes down to personal choice.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Very good blades I buy them because they are made in the USA and they are good though feathers are slightly better(sharper) but factor in the price difference and they come out on top. As long as they keep making them here I&#x27;ll keep buying them thank you...</li>
    <li> cleanest shaves and sharpest lines I&#x27;ve ever had</li>
    <li> The lower paragraph is the original review. This is an update.  I just bought my second C pack. I get from 4-7 shaves out of these.  I&#x27;m going to recycle the steel, so the waste is minimal.  My chosen weapon is a 1948-9 Gillette superspeed.  I also have a 1960s model, but that one bites sometimes.  The razor you use makes a difference. --- Prep is important with this shaving system.  Cuts are the result of taking shortcuts, pressing too hard, or using a dulled blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a couple of old Gillette butterfly razors, these are the solution to outrageous razor cartridge prices.  The first blade works about as well as the old (20 year plus) supply I&#x27;ve been using for the past several years.  -- This blade works well as long as you do the right prep before shaving.  Hot water, wet face, wash with soap, shaving lather and get the angle of the razor right.  DON&#x27;T GET IN A HURRY. --  No safety razor is going to get every whisker with the first pass.  Don&#x27;t be tempted to go over the first area shaved without lubricating soap.  Soap up a second time and feel the places where you missed.  Then go over the rough spots again.  You&#x27;ll get an astonishingly smooth shave that will easily last all day.  -- This type of razor works best when you use your dominant hand on your face.  You have to be even more careful when shaving arms, legs and under arms using your non dominant hand.  Irregular angles, bumps, loose skin and scars from acne, ingrown hairs etc will present an obstacle course that this type of shaving system has difficulty negotiating.  -- So revolt against expensive razors.  Note that the TSA will not let you take these in carry on luggage on an airplane.  You&#x27;ll still need a cartridge type razor if you fly.</li>
    <li> Great blades - inexpensive and American-made</li>
    <li> I recently purchased a new razor, the blades supplied with the razor were substandard. I purchased these USA manufactured Personna blades. They work much better with virtually no nicks even after multiple shaves</li>
    <li> Like many men, I&#x27;ve stopped using the high priced blades and started using an old school safety razor. These blades from Personna will last me 6-9 months and cost what I would&#x27;ve spent on blades in two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join the revolution and make shaving an experience.</li>
    <li> Love this ! Does a great job!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, and good quality. Will get from them next time.</li>
    <li> Great razor blade paired with Edwin Jagger DE89Lbl.</li>
    <li> I know there are other blades out that are sharper, but the Feathers are so sharp they actually irritate my skin.  I shave about 3-4 times a week with one blade, and switch it out.  Very rarely do I have skin irritation - very pleased!</li>
    <li> I think I like these better than the dorco and it was made in USA so that is a bonus. I shave about 3 times a week and one of these blade will last me through about 6 shaves or two weeks worth. Very hapy with the sharpness and quality.</li>
    <li> outstanding razors for the price. I&#x27;ve bought several different brand (all chinese made) and this one by far is the best bang for buck.</li>
    <li> Used to buy a 5 pack of these at the store for $2.75/ea. Needless to say, I don&#x27;t do that anymore. Excellent value, savings vs retail is well worth waiting on the blades to ship. If you&#x27;re a Personna fan, just go ahead and buy the blades. I&#x27;m looking at 2-3 years of shaving for less than $15 (at time of purchase). If you haven&#x27;t tried these blades, do so. Get a decent handle and enjoy 100 razors for the price of 3 cartridges in a refill pack.</li>
    <li> Blades work great for me, still on my first blade after 2 weeks. Still sharp; gonna be a while before I go through this pack!!</li>
    <li> With these blades, and my old fashioned Gillette safety razor, my face is now as fresh, and as smooth,  as it used to be when, many years ago, I was tempted, and lured away by the younger, seemingly attractive, more &amp;#34;modern&amp;#34; shaving devices. Never again, will I make that mistake. Good value, too.</li>
    <li> The only thing that I don&#x27;t like is that they are too sharp at first. They get better after about 2 shaves. But a great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used about 10 blades so far (3-5 shaves per blade) and they have been great. This is my favorite blade so far.  Made in the USA, cheap, and work great! Can&#x27;t get any better than that!</li>
    <li> These blades are extremely smooth, but are the only blades with which I actually nick myself.  Of the many varieties I have tried, these seem to be the sharpest.  I think that they should be handled the same way that Feather blades are handled and coupled with a mild razor. I give them 5 stars because they are extremely well made in the USA.  Blades are supposed to be sharp.  Here&#x27;s proof that Americans can meet and exceed product specifications.</li>
    <li> These are commonly referred to as Personna Lab Blues and come in the same wrapper as the Personna Med Prep blades.  I have both and find the Lab Blues to be much smoother than the Med Prep&#x27;s.  I can usually get anywhere from 4-6 shaves out of a blade and at this price that is a real bargain especially when you look at how expensive a Mach 3 blade is and what you get for it.  Once you learn how to wet shave which doesn&#x27;t take very long at all, I don&#x27;t see why anyone would ever use cartridges again!!  I think this is a great blade to start with too as it is sharp and smooth and is generally liked across the board and on the shaving forums and is also relatively cheap compared to other blades out there.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for these USA made blades, but the Egyptian Sharks seem to give a closer shave, with less burn and last about the same. The Sharks seem to be initially as good as the Merkur blades, but only last 1/2 as long at 1/10 the price. I may give the Israel Personna&#x27;s a try.</li>
    <li> My husband loves shaving with the double edge razor blades, and the Personna are much better than other brands we have purchased. I think it was a great price as well.</li>
    <li> Tried one and was not the least bit satisfied</li>
    <li> Good blades, not to little or to much of an aggressive blade.  Right in the middle</li>
    <li> Used blade4 with Above the Tie razor. Shave was really comfortable and clean. Blades are inexpensive.</li>
    <li> Great, great blades. Super sharp, great quality, this box of 100 will last me at least a year.  I switch every 3-4 shaves</li>
    <li> These blades along with Proraso shave soap equals the best shave of your life. I started wet shaving with a DE safety razor a few months back and researched pretty extensively on what blades to use. These are not only very good razor blades they are also made in the United States.</li>
    <li> Good price for the  amount of blades</li>
    <li> Good value for the money</li>
    <li> Saves Me A Lot Of Money Buying In Bulk! Now I can Change A Blade Out Every Other Day And Not Worry About Running Out!</li>
    <li> Bought these for my husband. He uses them everyday. They do a great job and are a fraction of the cost of the Gillette Mach razors he was using before. He says they do an equally good job if not better. Can&#x27;t beat price of shaving with these vs. modern razors. Lots of bang for the buck. Not sure if this particular brand is any better than other double edged brands but these work so well I suspect that any variance from brand to brand is minor.</li>
    <li> Sharp, lasts about 5-7 shaves. (Really heavy beard)</li>
    <li> 2 years of shaving for around $12, blades are sharp and come single wrapped without wax.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Just the right sharpness.  Can use each blade for a weeks worth of shaves.</li>
    <li> Very good blades. My wife uses them to cut my hair. You also sent me another set of 100 at no charge. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Great blades. I use them with both a DE and SE razor. Best bang for the buck - I used Feather before, but they always cut me. These have the right balance of sharpness and give for my face and skin. I have rough facial hair - so a bit of strength in the blade is great.</li>
    <li> sharp blades gives a good shave.</li>
    <li> Great blades, I get many shaves per blade.</li>
    <li> Blades are a good deal.  I have a Gillette H3 razor that is old yet these blades make it give a great shave.&lt;br /&gt;Blades are good for about four to five shaves, more if you don&#x27;t mind some tugging.&lt;br /&gt;Makes for real cheap shaves!</li>
    <li> These blades are very sharp and cheap. I am ditching non-eco-friendly plasic razors totally and going back to doing my shaving with an old Gillette Adjust-o-matic. I have a very light beard and have been shaving with the first blade for over a month! I don&#x27;t think I will have to buy another blade for a very very long time!</li>
    <li> These blades are great, I use each for 2-3 shaves no problem.  Easy to get out of the box and for the price you really cant beat it. They are made is the USA so i feel good about buying them.</li>
    <li> The BEST razor blades to date! I have tried most of the major brands of blades: Feather (Japan), Derby (Turkey), Wilkonson Sword (Germany), Polsilver (Polish/Russian), Crystal (Israel). BY FAR the American-made Personnas are the best, the overhyped Ïsraeli Personnas the worse! It is really reassuring that we still know how to make products which are top-notch and at a very reasonable price (here on Amazon.com). The Personnas paired with my Edwin Jagger razor are simply heavenly. I have a very tough beard, so I usually have problems, especially, since I most often shave every two days. My beard does not grow very quickly, but it is tough. Today I did a test ona three day beard. Smooth, close, no nicks, no harshness. What else can I ask for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using these blades for well over 2 months. DEFINITELY the best DE blade! I get far more close and comfortable shave than with Feather brand blades, no nicks or cuts even after 6 shaves (!) which I find amazing (Feather after 3 were terrible). Hey, we sometimes search far and wide, but things at home are best. OK, maybe a Porsche is better than a Corvette (on a German Autobahn at 150 mph IT IS), but these Personnas are simply TOP NOTCH and what is best of all they are MAde in the U.S.A.! What m akes this pie even better is the fact that they are less expensive than all the imports. And they go a  L O N G  way in terms of the number of excellent shaves. A KEEPER for me. I already bought two 100 packs at Amazon. com (where else)! Take care and good shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 2!&lt;br /&gt;These DE blades are simply astonishing (not to use the term awesome)! I get twice as many nick and cut free, close shaves as I did from Feather and Wilkinson. I am really at awe! And the shaves are much closer, less irritating. Taking into account the price and the fact they are American-made is really highly commendable. It makes me wonder why I searched and suffered for so long. TRY&#x27;EM YOU&#x27;LL LIKE&#x27;EM. I just added more to my cart, since they will be great gifts for my DE shaver friends. BRAVO Personna.</li>
    <li> Great blades quick shipping</li>
    <li> Much sharper than the derby blades I used previously.&lt;br /&gt;With that said these are great once your face adjusts to them at first I had more skin irritation.</li>
    <li> These blades don&#x27;t seem as sharp nor do they last as long as the Personna blades that come in the 5 pack. I was disappointed because I liked the 5 pack blades so well. I am not sure why the difference.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and value!</li>
    <li> Dollar Shave Month....IN YOUR FACE!</li>
    <li> Super sharp and super cheap. Baby smooth every time. Don&#x27;t let feather fool you, these are surgical sharp. Great blade and they&#x27;re american. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great product and fast delivery</li>
    <li> Good for the price. Made in the us is a plus. Not all razors are the same in the box. Some are supper sharp some not so much.</li>
    <li> These are great blades. I have used (and liked) Feather and Merkur blades. And I have used a dozen or more other blades from companies like Gillette and Wilkinson with mixed results. These Personna blades are sharp and give a very smooth and comfortable shave. My neck is pretty sensitive and these blades are forgiving, comfortable, and have reduced any irritation I have experienced with other blades. For the close shave, comfort, the price, and being made in America, I think I&#x27;ve finally found my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; blades!</li>
    <li> I purchased 3 packs which should last me for a number of years given that each razor last 2 weeks .</li>
    <li> They work good and were economical, but I still prefer Feathers.</li>
    <li> Super sharp. I can get about 10 shaves until i have to change the blade out.</li>
    <li> Very good blades. Will last him a life time.</li>
    <li> I really want to support an American labor, I do but... Not to say that those blades are dull, they simply are NOT as sharp as &amp;#34;Feather&amp;#34; brand. And after shaving with &amp;#34;Feather&amp;#34; for over a year, the switch was a bit painful. Some other reviewers said that they&#x27;ve shaved three times with one blade. I use one per shave, and to me, the blade seems unusable after that.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve ordered them when I&#x27;ve run out of blades, mainly because of 2 day Prime delivery and positive reviews. They&#x27;re usable, cheap, and delivery doesn&#x27;t take two month. That deserves at least three stars in my opinion. But I&#x27;m not going to order them again.</li>
    <li> These are saving me a ton on the expensive 5 blade razors and I am not wasting so plastic into the trash, but I don&#x27;t think they shave as close. I think the blade that came with my Merkur razor was much better and lasted like 4 weeks with shaving my face and head 2 times a week.</li>
    <li> These blades are great. Not quite as sharp as Feather blades, but sharper than anything other brand I&#x27;ve used. Great for the price!</li>
    <li> Sharp, smooth, and affordable! Can&#x27;t ask for more</li>
    <li> Good deal on blades you can&#x27;t even get close to this at the razor store.</li>
    <li> These are no feathers... Good enough if good enough is good enough. If you want a great shave pony up and get feathers.</li>
    <li> Mine aren&#x27;t wrapped in the blue paper, but still shave good. I can&#x27;t find anything labeled lab blue so it isn&#x27;t exactly what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> Good, but personna red package ones are the best. smoothest and closest  shave.  these blue ones give you a smooth shave but not close. I use a Edwin jagger de89bl razor, and it&#x27;s a very mild razor. Feather blades seem to work the best on it.</li>
    <li> Blades seem to get most of the credit or blame for the quality of a shave.  Yet razors, soaps, pre-shaves, after-shaves--and, of course, your face, hair, technique, and procedure--all play their part as well.  Still, the blade matters.  It&#x27;s just that all those other things are going to mean the same blade works (or doesn&#x27;t) for different people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, these Personna \\&quot;Lab Blues\\&quot; are a very good blade--for me.  I find them sharper than Dorco, Derby, the Israeli Red Personnas, Merker, Astra, Crystal and even Wilkinson (by a whisker :-)).  They are kinder to my face than all the aforementioned but Wilkinson, especially for the shaves on the second and third days(first day was a bit harsh, but less so than all others but the Wilkies).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, they most resemble the German-made Wilkinson and the Israeli \\&quot;Crystal\\&quot; (which is much less expensive and nearly as sharp and comfortable).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are consistent (each blade&#x27;s edge feels the same on my face) and durable (four shaves without sign of degradation).  And their price is comparable to Wilkinson, if you are willing to buy in bulk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have experience with any of the blades I mention, you may be able to judge how these will work on your face. I would say they tend toward the sharp end of the blade range, and their edge tends to be smoother than other blades.  Because you have to buy these in bulk to get a good price, they are a bit less convenient than Wilkinson (which are available at Walmart) and not much less expensive, so I see no compelling reason for me to switch.  But I like this blade very much.  I would say they are very much worth trying (some shaving places (e.g. West Coast Shaving) sell 5-packs, so you can try them out if you would rather not risk 100).</li>
    <li> Great product, works very good with no issue</li>
    <li> Great blades I see no difference these and the hospital blades as far as a close comfortable shave goes. I have recommended to others.</li>
    <li> the disposable razors are gone and I don&#x27;t know why they were even around in the first place.It proves that sometimes new and improved just isn&#x27;t true. with a safety razor you can get a great shave, save some money and be earth friendly</li>
    <li> Good blades.  In a small box, so it&#x27;s not hogging up all the space on the shelf.</li>
    <li> These are great blades for DE shaving, and a personal best for me. These are not quite as sharp as Feathers, but they&#x27;re up there and they&#x27;re smoother than a Feather. They may not be best for everybody, but they are for me. FYI I don&#x27;t have very thick hair, but very coarse and have always eaten through even the best blades. I get three great shaves with one of these, could likely go four or five but at this price on Amazon for a box of 100, I go ahead and put a fresh one on. Great smooth shave and skin looks and feels great. If you are looking for a sharper razor but a little smoother, try a Personna Blue</li>
    <li> These blades are everything I could have ever hoped them to be. I use these blades in my Merkur DE Safety Razor and in my Parker straight razor (snapped in half). I have medium facial hair and shave every day and I only change blades once a week. The dispenser box works well but gets crushed or drops blades if you pack it in a dopp kit so if you travel keep a few blades in a film canister or something similar.</li>
    <li> Bargain Price, Does as good as any triple blade I have tried.</li>
    <li> These blades are really a great deal. Although they are only at their best on the first shave, their price allows me to use a fresh blade every day. And they only cost me $3.00/Month.</li>
    <li> I love these blades.  After trying several samples, including Derby, Feather, Astra, Bluebird and Gillette, I find that these blades are among the sharpest I&#x27;ve tried, while being very smooth and long lasting.  In fact, these blades seem to stay sharper longer than any of the other blades.  When I first gave them a go, I was replacing them after three shaves, which was the useful lifespan of everything else I tried.  I decided to give a fourth pass a go, and was shocked that it was nearly as smooth as the first.  Then I tried a fifth, and sixth, and was still able to get a good shave.  By the seventh shave, the blades were starting to pull, but I was still able to do a full three-pass shave without too much irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not been doing this for long, but in my limited experience, these are every bit as sharp as the feather blades, while being half the price and longer lasting.  Some people never settle on a blade, but I suspect I will be using these for as long as I can still buy them.</li>
    <li> Great deal, these blades work great for the price, the large count prevents re ordering and feal great on the face.</li>
    <li> They seem to work just fine with my Mehaz safety razor. I&#x27;m very happy with the price and quality and will order these again. It&#x27;s time for all men to rebel against high-priced shaving cartridges and gimmicks and go back to what our grandfathers did. It&#x27;s the only way for a man to shave: no electricity needed, a very small learning curve, inexpensive, and much better results.</li>
    <li> Good quality from blade to blade. I have had some blades last 2 weeks and some four, but they all shave well until they start pulling on the beard. To have a blade last 2 weeks is really cools, especially since these blades are economical to begin with.</li>
    <li> gave a nice smooth shave.....no dragging and they last awhile too</li>
    <li> Good but I like the crystal super + better.</li>
    <li> Ok but not that great went back to old razors.</li>
    <li> Awesome blades that make me smile every time I see the blue box. I&#x27;ve purchased two boxes, that&#x27;s 200 blades and I use each blade three sometimes four times. So between the two boxes that puts me in a 600 to 800 range of days before I run out of blades. Compared to the cost of cartridge blades I&#x27;ve just made a killing in savings.</li>
    <li> These are absolutely great. I&#x27;d been using Derbys before (they are what came with the handle) and I feel like these are a definite step up, which is incredible since they are almost the same size (assuming you are using them like I do and splitting them in half, one hundred double blades becomes two hundred singles).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far they seem very sharp and well made, and have been easy to split (something I&#x27;d never done before and was honestly slightly concerned about).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The little dispenser style box is sort of nice, but not exactly a game changer. Some people may like it though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the blades I will be repurchasing when I need more.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t cut myself with these and they do a fine job of giving a nice shave.</li>
    <li> Work great and leave a smooth shave... rarely leaves a nick or ingrown hair.  Not too sharp or dull, good price... best part... made in USA!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t tried them yet but I figured I would pre-rate these.  I mean, if they work really good I will not get the chance to rate them later.  Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> Great product--quick shipping.</li>
    <li> I find the blades to be sharp and will last for several shaves.  The cost per blade is low so along with the fact that its made in the USA, I find this blade hard to beat.</li>
    <li> Much better than buying multiblades</li>
    <li> They are as always , the best blade I&#x27;ve ever shaved wirh</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read a lot of places that these should be replaced once a week. I will say it depends on your face. I have been using my current blade for over a month. If I keep that trend then I will get 4 or 5 years of shaving from this pack of blades. Hard to express how good it feels to get a better more comfortable and closer shave spending so little by comparison.</li>
    <li> Great blades.  Printing on the blades is poor, same for the little paper sleeves, made me wonder about the blade quality but they work great.</li>
    <li> **UPDATE** AS OF Feb 16, 2015:    Shaved second time with the same blade with different results.  Successfully have not cut/nicked myself using the Merkur 34C handle.  Must be the pressure/technique I am using with this blade.  Looking forward to another shave.  Don&#x27;t discount these and for 50% less than Feather well you know...    First time using a DE blade.  No other DE to compare against.  Used with a Merkur 34C with Arko shave soap. Have always used the disposable Gillette Mach 2 and 3 for 20+years with Barbarossa cream.  First shave was tough.  My facial hair is course and I ended up nicking myself about 4 times on the neck area.  Maybe its because of my first time with this blade and handle.  Additionally, after shaving I developed a rash in the same area and started to itch.  Second shave used same blade with a little better results with only 3 nicks and very little itching.  Third shave with 2nd blade is even better but its still not close enough in the chin area and has to be done twice.  Only 2 nicks with 3rd shave.  Estimate between 2 to 3 shaves per blade.  I shave about 1-2 times per week.    The Feather blades have a better reputation for sharpness but are more expensive.  If you are like me with course hair and softer skin then you may want to try the real Feather blades.</li>
    <li> Awesome blades for the price!</li>
    <li> Made In America. Enough said.</li>
    <li> I just started doing the DE thing, and I&#x27;ve only shaved with this blade once.  That being said, I got a very close and comfortable shave with no cuts.  I&#x27;m pretty happy about that.  I can&#x27;t imagine liking another blade better.</li>
    <li> Still working on my first box of 100.&lt;br /&gt;Sharp, smooth, very little pull.&lt;br /&gt;Blades are a great value, like 13 cents each.&lt;br /&gt;At that price, I can afford to get 2-3 shaves&lt;br /&gt;per blade. Probably could get more shaves if needed.&lt;br /&gt;Besides being inexpensive compared to cartgridge blades&lt;br /&gt;they are easy to re-cycle.</li>
    <li> The Persona Double Edge Blades are quite good.  They are not as sharp as Feathers or Iridiums, but they still do the job and are more forgiving. They are also quite cheap for 100 pack in a convenient package.</li>
    <li> This short review applies to Personnas in both safety razors and shavettes...&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried approximately 8-10 DE blades, and Personnas have been my undisputed favorites.&lt;br /&gt;Seem to get a consistent shave each time, whether it is the 1st or 4th with each blade.</li>
    <li> Shaves well.  Feather is still the gold standard for sharpness but these razors shave well and are forgiving. Best part is that they are made in America.  I would buy these again without hesitation</li>
    <li> Excellent blade for my new Merker DE razor.</li>
    <li> I like the razors so far. I use them with my Merkur 34c safety razor. The shave is pleasant and not too aggressive of a cut. I change blades every Monday.</li>
    <li> Great quality&lt;br /&gt;Great price</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin with stainless steel whiskers, a wonderful combo! I am relatively new to DE shaving although I am 48 years old. I shave with a Merkur 34c, Tabac shave soap and a $10 Omega boar hair brush. I bought a sample pack of blades including Astras, Shark, Feather, Gillette silver blues and Bluebird. I tried these blades for about a month and was about ready to go back to the cartridge razors until I tried the Personnas. The previously mentioned blades may not have gotten a fair shake as I was developing my technique, however the first time I shaved with a Personna blade there was no tug or pull and no post shave irritation. I have since started shaving with a Parker 26c open comb and the Personna blades and love the combo. My search is over, save yourself some time and give them a try, who really cares how many shaves you get from a blade as long as they perform! Made in the USA, love that too!</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with the item</li>
    <li> Way better than good news etc.........ill never go back to disposables!!</li>
    <li> They are razor blades, they are sharp, they work and there are a hundred of them. What more needs to be said.</li>
    <li> Evidently different people need different blades - these however are absolutely perfect for me.</li>
    <li> Sharp, consistent, inexpensive, and a bunch of &#x27;em. Make sure the DE shaver in your life has a box of these.</li>
    <li> Great blades, very sharp! I have only been wet shaving for about two months, so I&#x27;m still a novice. That being said these blades work wonderfully for me. Plus they are made here in America. I don&#x27;t see myself buying any other type of blades for a long time.</li>
    <li> very sharp and a good deal</li>
    <li> They do the job and I have enough blades for more than a year so 5 stars</li>
    <li> I really like these. I will be ordering again and giving as a gift. Smooth comfortable shave</li>
    <li> Not much to say here - these are really good blades at a very good price. I usually use Feather (most of the time) or Merkur blades. For me, the Personnas come somewhere in between the two - sharper than the Merkur, but more forgiving than the Feather. I get four good shaves from one blade - your experience will vary, depending on your beard type, shaving technique and even razor type.</li>
    <li> Best value that I&#x27;ve seen. Double edge blades are hard to find in local stores, and there&#x27;s a very small selection when you do find them.  These blade last for many shaves each and cut close and clean. I&#x27;ll order them again when I need them, which won&#x27;t be for a long time with 100 per box.</li>
    <li> I like Feather blades, but these are just as sharp, are more comfortable, are much less expensive, and are made in the USA. Plus, you have to wait for shipping of the Feathers from various countries and the Personnas were here a day earlier and were Prime for free shipping. What else could one ask for?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really, really happy with these blades! I bought a bunch of Derby Extras and have been consistently disappointed. These Personnas last a lot longer (I can shave two or three times, including my head with a single blade) and are far, far sharper.&lt;br /&gt;I think this is the brand I will stick with!</li>
    <li> Used them in my Merkur 38HD. I use them for shaving my head and they work great. No tugging and it only takes 2 passes for a 4 day length growth of my thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like how they&#x27;re wrapped individually.</li>
    <li> These razor blades work fine and I&#x27;m amazed at the low cost. I think they are a great buy and I enjoy them very much.</li>
    <li> Very nice blades.  Last about two weeks each with my shaving routine.  I purchased for use with a Merkur long handled safety razor.</li>
    <li> The blades themselves are great.  But they come with no way of safely disposing them.  You can either buy a sharps disposer or improvise one, as some reviewers have done, but nothing&#x27;s as simple and logical as disposing of the blades in the same package they came in.</li>
    <li> great blades. No nicks and very smooth shave. I prefer them to the Merkur Super blades.I&#x27;ll definately buy these again and Made in the USA!!</li>
    <li> Get 3-4 uses from each blade, always great results.</li>
    <li> SHARP and works great.... still using them.</li>
    <li> Really good blades and made here!</li>
    <li> Fairly new to DE shaving and still trying different blades.  These seem sharper than some of the others I have tried.  The first shave is a little rough, but the second, third and fourth shave are very smooth, even ATG.  I shave 5 times a week and I can shave comfortably with the same blade all week.  Other I have tried  (Derby, Shark, Dorco)  have been only good for two, maybe three shaves for me.  Great deal for the price.</li>
    <li> I have tried several brands of blades (being new to de shaving) and have found that I get the closest and smoothest shave with little to no irritation. I have sensitive skin, so I would recommend these blades for anyone who has problems with irritation.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised when I received these Personna razor blades.  I had used the Shark brand which was good but the Personnas lasted longer and I thought they were sharper than the Sharks.  I had previously used a big box store&#x27;s brand with triple blades which were OK but did not deliver the shave of Personna.  I would highly recommend them to anyone who wants the close shave of a double-edged blade and is tired of high priced Mach 3 blades and the like.</li>
    <li> Good not great blades. They do an adequate job. Okay deal when compared to other blades of similar quality.</li>
    <li> Wish the were a little sharper</li>
    <li> They lose their sharpness almost instantly. Avoid</li>
    <li> These are my favorite blades of all the ones that I have tried. Here&#x27;s my rating:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: all tests were done using a Merkur long blade razor, Proraso shaving soap, and a badger hair brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best to worst:&lt;br /&gt;1. Personna&lt;br /&gt;2. Astra double platinum&lt;br /&gt;3. CVS&lt;br /&gt;4. Wilkinson&lt;br /&gt;5. Feather&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personna - this blade is my favorite, and wins due to its consistency and durability. The quality is excellent and the blades last for 6-7 shaves easily.&lt;br /&gt;Astra - the more I use this blade, the more I like it, but it&#x27;s still a notch below the Personna. The quality is inconsistent and the sharpness varies too much. It typically lasts about 5-6 shaves.&lt;br /&gt;CVS - yes, the store brand. A pretty good shave, but not as good as the first two. Lasts about 4-5 shaves.&lt;br /&gt;Wilkinson - I had high hopes for this one since it&#x27;s available in lots of brick and mortar stores. Alas, it just isn&#x27;t very good. Only lasts a couple of shaves, and it&#x27;s like shaving with a butter knife.&lt;br /&gt;Feather - lots of people love this blade. It is by far the sharpest, and it left me with 853 cuts every time I used it. It also only lasts for 2-3 shaves and then it&#x27;s worthless.</li>
    <li> Clean shaving product works well but it&#x27;s been a spell since I used double edged blades so I intend to try a couple of different brands before I settle on one.</li>
    <li> These razor blades are horrible! They scrape, they don&#x27;t cut. The Astra Superior Stainless Steels that I usually use are sharper after five shaves than these Personnas. I don&#x27;t know if this is a bad batch or what? Maybe they&#x27;re fakes? These razor blades came wrapped in white paper, not the blue paper shown in the picture. These blades are unusable and a waste of money. Never again!!!!!!</li>
    <li> After using cartridge razors my whole life on my very thick facial hair, I made the switch recently and these blades give me a very close shave without any razor burn. Other than the obvious advantage in price, I love that I don&#x27;t have to fight with a cartridge razor after a few days of growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These blades performed even better than expected. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> bought for son for new razor he loves them</li>
    <li> Good blades at a great price</li>
    <li> Great blades and sharp.</li>
    <li> The personna blades were recommended to me and are amongst the top rated double edge razor brands. I have extremely thick facial hair and sensitive dry skin. I was worried about my switch to the double edge razor and even more worried about the need to switch to a sharper blade. These blades are extremely thin, easy to change, long lasting, and have some sort of a smooth coating on them which provides a buttery smooth feel when shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say that my thick facial hair allows me to get a good 3-4 quality shaves per blade which makes this the best bang for your buck blade! 100 count will get me through a year easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be back for more and have every intention of promoting these blades to future single blade shavers.</li>
    <li> Having used the Personna Med Preps for some time now I decided to try the Blue Labs. All the forums basically said that they were very much the same except for the Preps having an additional process to make them super sterile. Some folks did find a difference between the two. I respect their opinions but I have to side with the majority of users of both blades saying that I see and feel no discernible difference between the two. In a word they are both excellent.&lt;br /&gt;If I had to make a choice the decision would favor my wallet and go for the Blue Labs.</li>
    <li> Very good blades!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I would like to mention, the product looks a little different from what is pictured.  The box is identical, but the wrapper for individual blades are plain white paper, not blue.  The blade themselves says &amp;#34;Personna Super / Personna Made in U.S.A.&amp;#34; only.  It does not have the arrows or another &amp;#34;MADE IN U.S.A.&amp;#34; near the edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only have experience with Merkur blades and this one.  Comparing the two, this one works better for me.  Since I have very coarse and thick Asian hair, it tugs less, cuts smoother without jumping, and leaves me with less irritated skin.  The difference is rather large, and quite evident when I put after-shave....  Also, it costs a lot less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;m going to order more.</li>
    <li> Great price on my goto blade.  USA made, works in all 3 of my razors, only down side is you need a blade bank as these are individually wrapped bulk pack.</li>
    <li> Quality blades in single package that work great, can&#x27;t beat the price for these precision edge blades</li>
    <li> They are OK if you have thin or sparse facial hair. They don&#x27;t give the closest of shaves, and if you are a man with thick/fast growing hair then these will give you an irritating shave. So they&#x27;re just OK.</li>
    <li> This is the second sharpest after Feather brand (so far i have tested)</li>
    <li> I now have enough blades to last me a life time.</li>
    <li> The price was right. Good for three shaves. I still like Feather blades best.</li>
    <li> Just got these blades back early feb.2015 and these are probably going to be my new favorite blades. I get a very smooth shave and don&#x27;t nick my face like i did with other blades. I have some feather blades and their good and sharp, but they don&#x27;t shave as smooth as the  Personna Double Edge Razor Blades, 100 Count. Plus the price was unbeatable. At this price you could use a new blade every shave. Put these blades with an Edwin Jagger DE89 and i think you will be smooth shaving from now on.</li>
    <li> This is my first purchase of double edge blades for many a year and so far I could not be any happier with this style of shaving.  These blades are sharp so a person has to be careful.  So far a blade seems to last quite awhile so 100 ought to keep for me some time.  What a great alternative to modern Mach 3 shaving.</li>
    <li> I used to get the Merkur blades until Amazon stopped carrying them, and these Personna blades are just fine.</li>
    <li> Bought these to go with a merkur futur for those days when you wake up all groggy and the straight razor would take too long. Good price on a good blade.</li>
    <li> These blades are very sharp and make for a very smooth shave.  And at 15 cents a piece a very good bargain.  With that being said, I think these are not for a shaving novice.  I learned on these and cut myself many times.  If you are new to safety razor shaving I have found the Derby to be more forgiving.  But if used properly these give a better shave than the Derby, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the packaging leaves a little to be desired.  Each blade is individually wrapped in paper; which I try to hang onto for disposal of the blade.  But keeping a small thin cardboard box in good shape for a year or so can prove difficult.  And once the box is about half empty the blades flop around inside the box and very rarely can become slightly damaged.  I have only found this to be a problem when traveling extensively and now I simply bring a few blades on trips instead of the entire box.</li>
    <li> smooth, sharp, and long lasting at a very good price.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time getting any other blades. These blades are by far the sharpest blades out there. Makes smoother blade passes as it effortlessly cuts the hair. Less nicks and cuts. And it&#x27;s made in the USA! &#x27;Merica!!</li>
    <li> I was scared to buy this since I read that some people experienced missing blades. The blades themselves are amazing on my skin, but I received 109 blades. The blade count doesnt seem consistent.</li>
    <li> I use the Personna Double Edge Razor Blades with a Merkur Model 38 HD Classic Safety Razor. As I noted in my 5-star review of the Merkur safety razor, the Personna blades provide a fantastic shave at a fraction of the price of multi-blade razor cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found multi-blade cartridges offensively expensive. I could never understand the cost, but when I&#x27;d try generics from the drug store, they didn&#x27;t last as long, and they didn&#x27;t provide as good a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched to the safety razor with these blades in part because of the cost savings, in part because of reviews I&#x27;d read of safety razors, and in part because I liked the idea of shaving with something hefty. The safety razor embodies a certain traditional masculinity to the shaving routine, and these razor blades provide an exquisite shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the sensation of the blade cutting through my stubble, and I have not drawn blood a single time in nearly three months of use with these blades and the Merkur razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that I get about one week with each blade. I could probably go longer, but the blades are so inexpensive, I see no reason to push it. I change the blade Monday morning, and I don&#x27;t have to think about it through the rest of the week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades are individually wrapped in easy to open pouches, and the box has a cut-away flap and acts a dispenser inside the medicine cabinet. These 100 blades take up less space than 10 shaving cartridges and provide for a far less cluttered bathroom than traditional cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am, as you can tell, very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Great blades, Great Price, Made in USA! I have tried several different double blades. You will be hard pressed to do better than these!</li>
    <li> I really like these blades. blade choice is such a personal preference, but it has been very difficult to use anything else since I started using these.</li>
    <li> These blades are sharp and they last. Get a great shave and support American business! I have used feather and Astra. I consider astras butternknifes compared to these. The feathers are in 2nd place but are Japanese and cost more.</li>
    <li> These razors shave well on my neckline.  I don&#x27;t get cuts.  My wife tried and she loved them for her  legs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few blades including the Feather blades.  While these don&#x27;t provide as much feedback as the Feathers I prefer these.  They performed well and gave me a clean, close shave with three passes, one against the grain, one across the grain and one against the grain.  Left very little irritation.  My razor is fairly mild and I will be trying these with a more aggressive razor soon.  The price is right for the quality of shave these deliver.  I use them daily and they are my go to blade.</li>
    <li> Nice and sharp. Recyclable packaging, made in USA.</li>
    <li> This review comes with a caveat- DE razor blade reviews with few exceptions are fairly subjective, a variety of factors including the coating, face feel, razor you are using and the kind of skin you have all affect how a blade feels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, Personnas are good in some razors and bad in others. They seem to feel about as sharp as a Feather blade (maybe slightly less) and last about 5-7 days of consistent use, but I have light growth so blades tend to last a while for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades are well packaged and will arrive in a box that prevents them from being ruined, each blade is then individually paper wrapped. They are very consistent (unlike some brands) and of the 100 I&#x27;ve used every one of them has been perfect with no discoloration, bad edges, rust, ect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These blades are identical to the Personna Med Preps (according to the shaving forums) which are pricier and highly sought after for their excellent shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice is to get a sampler pack that includes these before committing to 100 of them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these blades for about 3 months now.  I&#x27;ve used them in a Gillette Super Speed, a Gillette Red Tip, and a Schick Krona.  I&#x27;ve been very pleased with the performance and durability in all 3 razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They last me about a week-I shave 4-5 times a week so a box should last almost 2 years.  I have yet to nick myself with these blades, even with the more aggressive Gillette Red Tip.  In the Super Speed and Krona they are very forgiving, and I don&#x27;t have an issue with moderate pressure or multiple passes.  I naturally change my technique a little when using the Red Tip due to it&#x27;s more aggressive nature, no matter what blade is in it.  But even with the Red Tip I find I don&#x27;t need to be as cautious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been using Feather blades before these, and while they give a good close shave, the Personna blades are much more forgiving than the Feather blades.  I also prefer the packaging; in bulk there is no plastic, and there is no sticky glue holding the paper wrapper on (the Feather blades have a couple glue dollops that make the slick paper hard to remove).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are a genuine all around good blade, with the advantage of being made in the USA.</li>
    <li> After trying a few different types of razors I found these to give a smoother feeling while shaving.  I have also noticed that I get less nicks and irritation.  I am quite happy with these blades and the price is not bad for a lifetime supply of razors...seriously 100 razors is a lot.  Anyway, I found that these razors worked well for me.  If you haven&#x27;t tried these type of razors yet, I would recommend buying a smaller pack just to see how they feel.</li>
    <li> one blade is all you need.....all those 3-4-5-10 razor blades are to charge you more....one is all you need to shave...good quality. One blade can last you one month.... I have enough blades for almost7 years LOL</li>
    <li> I think these blades are great, very sharp and very durable.  I&#x27;ve had these blades for a few weeks now and I&#x27;ve only replaced one blade so far and I shave every day due to work grooming standards.</li>
    <li> They work well, i don&#x27;t have experience to compare them to anything else, but they do work.</li>
    <li> I have been using these types of razors for a few years now but never heard of this brand before. They were on sale so on a whim I thought I would try them. These are the only ones I&#x27;ll be using from now on.  Very happy with their performance.</li>
    <li> I used the Derby blades that came with my Edwin Jagger with no complaints.  I was happy to return full circle to a safety razor after many years of multi bonded blades and razors.  I like the closeness of the shave with fewer passes, cost savings, the ability to see what I&#x27;m doing when I square my sideburns, and being able to shave up close under your nose.  I also am enjoying shaving again.  As I used up the 5 Derby blades, I started looking at the options for DE blades.  I was attracted to the Personna &amp;#34;Blues&amp;#34; because of the great ratings, the cost, and the fact that they were still manufactured in the U.S.  After the first shave, I decided that they were far superior to the Derbys in sharpness and comfort.  They seemed to last for more quality shaves, as well.  After a few weeks, I really don&#x27;t feel the need to look any further.  I am completely satisfied with these blades (though at some point, I may try Feather blades only because of curiosity).</li>
    <li> Blades work great, awesome shave. My only issue is that i thought these were the Lab blues as the picture shows them wrapped in the blue wrapper. However my blades that arrived were wrapped in just plain white paper. Maybe i misread the discription, but again not the lab blues that i was looking for.</li>
    <li> Not much to add, but I am required to use 16 words in this message so now I have 16</li>
    <li> My husband had tried other brands but he feels as these give him a closer shave that lasts longer. For sure will buy again!</li>
    <li> I really like the packaging for these razors. Much easier to get a new blade out than the common plastic dispensers. I got a great shave and they lasted a long time, but no matter what I did, I could not avoid cutting myself. Nothing serious, but I do not get this with other razor blades. Maybe my skin is just too sensitive. If this is not a problem for you, then I recommend them.</li>
    <li> For anyone concerned about blade disposal, buy a \\&quot;blade safe\\&quot;. Amazon sells them. They hold many, many used blades which can be recycled when it&#x27;s full. Will probably take several years worth of shaving to do so. Smart solution, and good for the environment, too.</li>
    <li> Each razor is lasting about 7 days before I replace it, could probably go a little longer but dont want to push it. This is a great move going from the expensive disposables to the safety razors. Saves a ton of money and I no longer get the razor burn.</li>
    <li> Just used the first blade this morning, and what a difference, at first I thought I had forgot to put a blade in the Razor, until I felt my face and realized what a smooth shave I had.  Great blades, they will be my blade of choice from now on!</li>
    <li> I got a good deal on these blades and enjoy the smooth shave, would definitely purchase again in the future</li>
    <li> My husband is a shave fanatic.  He has thirty-eight different DE blades in his inventory and said that the Personna Lab is one of his favorites so I recently ordered 600 from Amazon.  He said this is a great price. He also like Personna Meds but they are more than twice as much and he really does not see much difference.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll be getting these blades from now on.  They rival feather in terms of sharpness, but are quite a bit cheaper.  They also arrived promptly.  Great stuff.</li>
    <li> Great Blades.  Nice and sharp and shave is smooth.  I haven&#x27;t been using a single blade razor long so I cant compare to others but so far I like them.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive item that does its job. It reminds me a lot of Wilkinson Sword and Gillette blades--while they&#x27;re not lux stuff like Feathers, they&#x27;re not Pakistani face maulers either, so you can use a firmer hand with short strokes and not worry about irritation or cuts. For the price, you can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> Works just fine on my face. No more cuts or scrapes than a disposable and that is from someone that is impatient with shaving.</li>
    <li> Sharp blades and seem to be cheaper than buying the razors that are locked up in cabinets at stores and cost a fortune.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been safety razor wet shaving for quite a while, and tried dozens of blade brands/types. Picked up these Personna blades because they were US made, and was surprised to get the most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve had in years. Smooth glide and no scrapes or razorburn, even when against the grain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very impressed.</li>
    <li> Very sharp and gives a very nice shave even without shaving cream. My hubby uses his great grandfathers 1940s Gillette razor and i use a new merkur razor these blades work well in both and give a clean close shave even on my legs</li>
    <li> sharp but cheap...have to get used to them again....</li>
    <li> I enjoy my shave everyday.</li>
    <li> Good stuff American-made</li>
    <li> almost as good as feathers</li>
    <li> I could care less that they are made in the &amp;#34;USA&#x27; as I am a real consumer and do not like to protect myself from high prices as I try and bat away foreign competition. That being said these are very sharp and inexpensive.</li>
    <li> Smooth shave. No complaints here.</li>
    <li> Will never use disposable razors again!  This blade combined with the Merkur Classic Safety Razor and shaving cream and Neutragena after shave lotion &#x3D; awesome shave!  I look forward to shaving now.</li>
    <li> You simply can&#x27;t beat these for the price.  They are not as sharp - I&#x27;ll say &amp;#34;aggressive&amp;#34; - as Feathers, but they work very well.  I also like the dispenser pack.  I&#x27;ve tried a number of different brands, and admit that there are some that I like better, but overall and for the price these are hard to beat.  I typically get 2-3 shaves from this blade, which is the same I got from the Feather and other higher priced brands.  Try them out - you really can&#x27;t go wrong with the price.</li>
    <li> Excellent for the price</li>
    <li> Great product and well worth the single use value</li>
    <li> Great looking blades.. As I would expect..But cannot import a butterfly razor to fit..</li>
    <li> very sharp!! very good deal!!!!</li>
    <li> They are razor blades not much else to say about them.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe it took me so long to find these.  I an very frugal, ok to the point I am cheap.  I have not been to a barber in almost 20 years now, since I started cutting my own hair.  When razor blade prices went to the point of being ridiculous, I started buying throw away.  Now they are to the price of being ridiculous pus they don&#x27;t shave worth a darn.  It was to the point I was only shaving twice a week but if course that made it worth.  These are under 13 1/2 cents each and for my money shave as good as a $3 dollar blade.  This is really a no brainer and the best find I&#x27;ve had in a long time.</li>
    <li> The blade company now belongs to the Energizer Company instead of the American Safety Razor Company. The individual blades are now wrapped in white plain paper instead og the blue personna printed paper and the blades are not nearly as sharp as before. Way to go Energizer bunny!</li>
    <li> The blades didn&#x27;t stay sharp enough long enough.</li>
    <li> Price is great. I have used about 3 or 4 blades, and so far all of them have been sharp and sturdy. This is definitely a great buy</li>
    <li> Product was as expected.</li>
    <li> They stay sharp after several shaves. Last longer than the feather blades I had.</li>
    <li> great blades great price need I say more</li>
    <li> Great product for the price.</li>
    <li> MY HUSBAND SEEMS TO REALLY LIKE THEM.</li>
    <li> I am new to the safety razor way of shaving.  If you are too then try several blades to see which one your face responds to best.  For me that is the Personna. It is surgical sharp like the Feather blades but the Feathers seemed to cause me a little more facial irritation.  Bonus the Personnas are made in the USA and they arrived in 2 days versus 4 weeks. $15 for 100 blades beats the heck out of $20 for 4 multi blades and I get a much  better shave.</li>
    <li> These blades did a great job for me. Much better than the Dorco blades my father in law sent me or the Derby&#x27;s that came with my razor.</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s to say?  Personna blades are some of the best on  the market</li>
    <li> American steel and SHARP.</li>
    <li> Just OK.  Good for back up blades if you run out of better brand name</li>
    <li> Sharp  and indispensable dispensable product!</li>
    <li> These are exceptional. I bought a DE razor at target a few months ago and razor blades there were more expensive and only came with 5. I&#x27;m in the army and have to shave every day I have duty and used to get bad razor burn, so bad that by the third day of shaving with my Gillette I couldn&#x27;t stand the feel of the blade on my skin. With these I get a nice smooth face all the way till Friday at a fraction of the cost. Each last me about 2 shaves and get it smooth as butter. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> excellent and good value</li>
    <li> smooth shave. nice blades</li>
    <li> Great blades, great price.  Never let me down.  Get a few shaves out of each.  Use them in my Merkur progress and have it on a 1.5.  I have crazy sensitive skin on my neck, but this works like a charm.</li>
    <li> A good product at a good price, recommended.</li>
    <li> Purchased these bad boys for my Merkur razor and I have to say that they are very good. Each razor lasts me for a few shaves without any problems, they are definitely not dull after the first shave. Great price and great product. If you are looking for dependable, quality, replacement razors then look no further.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I switched to single blade shaving.  I no longer get razor burn or irritation and I&#x27;m saving money too.</li>
    <li> Saw all the reviews of how sharp these blades are, so I gave them a shot. Yes they are American made which is nice, but for me these pale in comparison to the astra&#x27;s I&#x27;ve been using and even the derby&#x27;s. I&#x27;ve been wet shaving for roughly a year, and I may not be a pro, but I have a pretty good idea on how to get the best shave for me. And these blades are not the answer. I&#x27;ve never had a blade pull and tug/yank the hair out like these do. My beard growth is average to mild with regards to how heavy. I also work outside, so my face is not the softest. Luckily blades in multi packs are very inexpensive. I will have no problem giving these away and steering clear of them.</li>
    <li> Love them. thank goodness I rediscovered wet shaving. These blades are absolutely sharper the  Merkur blades. no problems. It is slightly easier to knick yourself  the first couple of times. I say a couple because I now have shaved 5 times with the same blade and it feels just as sharp ..Save a ton of money by buying bulk from Amazon. The cheapest I found double sided blades elsewhere was Walmart but they came to about 68 cents a blade good buy. .</li>
    <li> Great razors super sharp.better then china knock offs last way longer</li>
    <li> These blades are merely on par with Derby, and Astra, but cost a little more. For the money Chrystal (Red Personna) blades perform better. I&#x27;ll use a Personna blade one time, and toss it.</li>
    <li> MADE IN USA. Ultra sharp, great value, lasts for 4 to 5 shaves on my beard from hell. I shave in the shower after all other duties are done and my beard has softened under warm water. No more expensive Mach 3 blades for me.  I also purchased a Gilette Super Speed razor from 1953 (they have a stamped date code on them) on a popular auction site for $22. The razor and blade combination is very effective and just as easy to maintain as any current shaving system and certainly far more cost effective. Multi-blade systems aren&#x27;t any more effective and only burn your face by scraping your skin after the hair has been removed by the first blade. Those little illustrated advertising movies of the hair being cut partially by the first blade only to have subsequent blades come along right behind to cut the supposedly left over hair are just that, movies, and pretty much &amp;#34;science fiction&amp;#34; movies at that. Think it out for yourself and stop wasting your money on supposedly modern multi-blade $y$tem$. Don&#x27;t believe me? Pick up the inexpensive plastic handled Feather brand double edge razor (a good low cost precision starter razor) and try it for yourself.</li>
    <li> wow,i am really wondering if all the positive 5 star ratings are employees of american safety razor co,,,which makes personna blades,,i am die hard double edge razor guy ,,but these dont come close for me ,,,i really wanted to buy from american company ,,,but i will go back to feather blades from japan...which for me are 5star blades</li>
    <li> Srsly! WAYYYY cheaper than Mach 3 razors I&#x27;ve been using for YEARS. Save yourself dolla dolla billzzzzzzz ya&#x27;ll! Go slow though, otherwise you&#x27;ll need some tissue to cover the cuts all over yer faces... :-)</li>
    <li> In my search for the perfect shave I bought these along with some more expensive ones (feather).  These seem to work just as well as the more expensive ones and with 100 in a pack I can have a clean new razor every time I shave and it doesn&#x27;t cost me an arm and a leg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I end up shaving 3 times (2 times with grain, 1 sideways) this is the best way to not get razor burn and since these are so damn sharp its a closer shave than I ever got with my Mock3 razor which also did 3 passes i just one stroke and I was going over my face 2 times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I think these razors are perfect for learning how to shave with a double edge razor as they are not too crazy sharp.  I have started to use Feather razors and damn they are super sharp but using the techniques I learned from these blades I am a much better shave with the feather blades.  I think the key is basically to apply almost no pressure to your face, I mean almost none.  I thought I was using a light touch but using even less I no longer cut my neck and get a great shave!</li>
    <li> These Personna lab blue blades are pretty good, but recently I found some razor blades I like even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using a double edge razor (Edwin Jagger DE89lbl) this year and have been trying different razor blades.  I have a tough beard and find that sharper blades usually do a better job for me.  I tried Derby, Wilkinson, Bic, Astra, and Personna lab blues and found the Personna to be the best of these razor blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after doing some reading in some of the shaving forums I recently tried Gillette Silver Blue and Permasharp blades and like both better than the Personnas.  The Silver Blues are sharper and smoother and give me a great shave.  The Permasharp are very sharp and also give me a great shave.</li>
    <li> I use these blades with a 1960s Merkur slant razor.  One blade easily lasts me three to four shaves.  I have found the blades to be sharp but not the sharpest blades I&#x27;ve ever tried ... and I mean that as a good thing.  These blades are great for a variety of wet shavers, from the beginner to the old pro.  100 blades will probably last me a full year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the best part:  These blades are MADE IN THE USA!  It feels good to shave with a quality product that is made here at home.  Your face will agree.</li>
    <li> Will never buy multiple blade razors again. great smooth shave and will last me over a year. great value great shave</li>
    <li> When my store stopped offerring Gilette double edge blades I ordered this brand from you.  With Gilette blades I got several more clean, smooth shaves than I have experienced with these blades.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 75 years old and I learned to shave with a razor like this, my father&#x27;s razor, what everybody shaved with back in the day, pretty much. After I hit my middle twenties I switched to strait razors and used them for a several years till a young both I befriended stole all my razors and I didn&#x27;t want to spend the money to replace them all. After that I don&#x27;t remember what I did to shave or how I got caught up in the crazy multi-blade nonsense, dirty and expensive and unpleasant. I am glad to be back to this method of a clean blade every time and the ability to shave all the time without breaking the bank. The one problem I have is shaving all the time, say every third day or so, I find it tough on my skin, unpleasant in the after-effect. I am starting to slip back into old habits of not shaving so much again because of it.</li>
    <li> Better than the sharks haven&#x27;t gotten nicked yet using for about a week now</li>
    <li> Good blades but my face lies a slightly smoother blade!</li>
    <li> My go to blades. Quick shipping. These (for me) are the perfect balance between sharpness &amp; forgiving, and believe me I have tried them ALL. Once I found these I stopped using Feathers.</li>
    <li> If you use a shavette (straight razor that uses double edge blades split in two) than this is a great blade. I have used drug store generics and Astra Superior Platinum Double Edge blades and these are much smoother. The Astra blades work great in a safety razor such as the Merkur 180 but tend to tug when using the shavette where the Personna blades glide across my skin. I now only use the Personna blades in my shavette and I am very happy, no irritation at all!</li>
    <li> great price, about 1 in 10 cuts a little dull but for the price you cant beat these.  i change blades based on how long they last, most last 2 uses, some 3 or occasionally 4, and 1 in 10 is either a dull one that cuts like its already been used or is a great one that lasts a whole week.</li>
    <li> Excellent Blades!!! Very sharp!! Update: I&#x27;ve tried a few other blades and they were good but these are excellent and every bid as good as the other I&#x27;ve tried and at a good price!</li>
    <li> And now it doesn&#x27;t have to! These are great blades and deliver a smooth shave. Men have been using these for years without any trouble at all. So do yourself a favor and stop throwing your money away on today&#x27;s overrated and overpriced razors and blades!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(You&#x27;re welcome.)</li>
    <li> Outstanding, You can not beat the quality or price</li>
    <li> Purchased these Pursonna razors for my new DE razor.  I based my purchase off reviews and write-ups that Personna was a sharp razor and good all around, not too sharp but not too dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had no issues with these razors.  They are sharp and smooth to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend Personna.</li>
    <li> Seems like not only a great deal (100 blades) but they appear to work well to.  I am still using the first blade for over a week now and it is doing fine.</li>
    <li> Super cheap and seem to be reasonably sharp.  I&#x27;m using these in an Edwin Jagger DE89 which came with a sampler of 5 Derby blades.  These seem to be very slightly sharper than the Derbies and last 6-7 shaves before I change blades.  I&#x27;m currently using with Taylor of Old Bond Street Avocado Shave Cream.  I know everyone says that you should, &amp;#34;buy a sampler and try out 100 different blades&amp;#34;, but I switched to a double-edge razor to save money not get into a new hobby.  I feel like I already splurged buying the TOBS shave cream.  These razors in a DE89 on my medium beard work just fine, much more enjoyable than the Mach 3 ever was.</li>
    <li> I have tried a few different blades before (Feather, Merkur, some others I can&#x27;t remember) and I like these the best. They somehow leave me getting less nicks while still giving me a nice smooth shave. I like that they are made in the USA, as well as a big thing I haven&#x27;t seen anyone mention... They don&#x27;t put a drop of wax on the blade to keep it wrapped up! I know this is something that others have been annoyed with when using other blades, but these are just wrapped in paper with no wax to keep it &amp;#34;sealed&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;The only con is that they don&#x27;t come with a proper way to dispose of used blades. I have just been throwing mine in the old plastic thing that the Merkurs came in.</li>
    <li> Good product for the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m tired of paying up the nose for the Mach III&#x27;s  I love my single blade Merkur shaver with these blades.</li>
    <li> Anyone who isn&#x27;t using a SAFETY Razor is really missing out. You get a great shave and a very much LOWER COST shaving experience. Compare buying 100 of these blades for $16.00 or less versus all the fance INJECTOR 2/3/4BLADE Cartridges. You get a better shave with a smile, the smile from all the money you&#x27;ll save.</li>
    <li> Great blades for the money. Be careful as they are super sharp!</li>
    <li> These blades have been made for a very long time, sharp and work well.</li>
    <li> Not the sharpest blades I&#x27;ve used! I usually have to use both sides on a client because they dull ridiculously quick.  Recommended the Dorco brand, they are sharper and cheaper!</li>
    <li> These razors work great. I get a week of shaving per blade, which means I won&#x27;t have to buy blades again for a long time. I love the fact that they are MADE IN THE USA.</li>
    <li> A years worth of blades for under 20 bucks.  What more can I say but buy these they&#x27;re good for about five shaves per blade.</li>
    <li> Smooth and very forgiving. I try to go back to Astra and Personna Red and they feel awful. Will be sticking to Lab Blue&#x27;s from now on.</li>
    <li> First DE blades i tried they cut smoothly the whiskers for the price you cant get a better razor going to cartbridge.</li>
    <li> I am pretty sure I received FAKE blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Personna supposed to come each  in blue paper with a print on the brand name on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine are rapped in white paper, most definitely FAKE BLADES.</li>
    <li> I read a lot of reviews concerning double edged shaving blades. I spent a fair amount of time pouring over reviews of the Persona blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a few other brands of blades and find these to be very comfortable and useful. And you cannot beat the value - $20 (with shipping) for 100 blades? Additionally, they are made in the USA!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend these blades with no hesitation!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about what folks in the shaving community call the &amp;#34;Lab Blues.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This blade is my go-to in more than 30 double-edge razors. While I have a number of other blades in my rotation, I always reach for the P-each when I&#x27;m trying out a new razor, or simply looking to get a shave that balances comfort and efficiency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My SO loves this blade for her legs in the EJ89. It simply blows multis away, and she never gets nicks or irritation - even without the deceiving &amp;#34;comfort strip.&amp;#34; Like me, she is a brush latherer, soap of choice is TOBS Avocado or Grapefruit.</li>
    <li> First blades I decided to try with my safety razor after hearing so many good reviews on them. They work out nicely and with 100 they will last me for quite a while.</li>
    <li> Not as sharp as its competitor Feather Razor Blades but it gets the job done and cheaper.</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;m very pleased with these blades. I&#x27;ve tried Shark, Astor, and Derby. These are my favorite thus far.&lt;br /&gt;Tips: Hydrate shave brush in mug with hot water while you shower. Hot shower to hydrate face. I also use extra hair conditioner on my hands to further soften beard. Once showered I use a mixture vegetable glycerin and almond sweet oil on my face and let it moisturize face while I fill sink with hot water and work up lather using Proraso cream (awesome for the price).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vegetable Glycerin and  almond sweet oil recipe:&lt;br /&gt;2 tablespoons vegetable glycerin&lt;br /&gt;2 tablespoons almond sweet oil&lt;br /&gt;6-8 ounces of filtered water&lt;br /&gt;Small spray bottle&lt;br /&gt;Mix vegetable glycerin, almond sweet oil, and water; stir with small wisk quickly. Pour into spray bottle. Shake spray bottle prior to each use, spray small amount on hands, rub on beard.</li>
    <li> Did&#x27;nt meet my expectation. No more.</li>
    <li> nice blades, going back to old style razor. cuts closer</li>
    <li> I use these blades with the Merkur Model 38 Hd Classic &amp;#34;Barber Pole&amp;#34; Long Safety Razor and I have never had a better shave.</li>
    <li> BEST SHAVE EVER, A VERY PLEASENT SUPPRISE , I GET 4 SHAVES OUT OF EACH BLADE, HOLDS EDGE VERY WELL, COST EFECTIVE AA++</li>
    <li> I got these along with my Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor and they work fantastic. I could probably use them longer in a pinch, but they will last a good 5 shaves before I chuck it. May as well, their dirt cheap compared to disposable razor heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never tried others so I can&#x27;t compare, but for the money, you can&#x27;t beat this.</li>
    <li> This was not so good, half of the blades were empty in the box.</li>
    <li> Razors are very sharp!  Be careful when first using them for the first, and second shaves.  Made in the USA, very smooth shaves, just be careful the during the first shave.</li>
    <li> I purchased Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor that comes with 1 Merkur blade. So I used that blade first. Than I started using Personna and found it very good, but not as sharp as Merkur blade.&lt;br /&gt;Still, is a very sharp blade for a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I use these in a Muhle R89 they work great. I also got 5 off for Christmas thank you amazon. Better than a derby and on par with shark and astra.</li>
    <li> Some use the term \\&quot;aggressive\\&quot; to describe DE blades - that is a misnomer.&lt;br /&gt;Just like a knife, DE blades are sharp or not. The \\&quot;aggressive\\&quot; part comes&lt;br /&gt;from the razor - how much blade is exposed and at what angle.&lt;br /&gt;As far as I can tell, these are some of the sharper blades available -&lt;br /&gt;almost as sharp as Feathers. I have tried at least 20 different blades,&lt;br /&gt;and the Feathers and Super Iridiums were my previous favorites.&lt;br /&gt;Sharp blades may not work for everyone, but they work great for me, in a&lt;br /&gt;moderately aggressive razor, the Edwin Jagger DE87. Anyway, I was very&lt;br /&gt;happy to find these blades, they are sharp and smooth, come in a convenient&lt;br /&gt;dispenser pack, only have one wrapper around the blade, and do not use&lt;br /&gt;any wax dots to secure the blade in the packaging. The wax dots are a&lt;br /&gt;minor inconvenience, they gum up the inside of the razor, but it&#x27;s a&lt;br /&gt;bonus to not have them. These blades are a real bargain, and they can be&lt;br /&gt;found for an even lower price if you know where to look!</li>
    <li> I really like the PERSONNA DOUBLE EDGE RAZOR BLADE. It gives me a clean,close shave. The only problem with this 100 pack of blades is that it needs a throwaway system for the used blades. Like in back of the other double edge blade boxes there is a slit for the used blades that makes it safer to throw away. This doesnt have that. But this is a good blade nontheless.</li>
    <li> Good product and fast delivery.</li>
    <li> sharp razors cheap no more buying expensive blades this is my new mantra</li>
    <li> good pack of blades, good quality, provides an expected close shave. Arrived on time</li>
    <li> No, the price keeps going up.  I now have to look for an alternative product.</li>
    <li> You know I was initially taken back by the low price. Come on 100 blades for how much??? So after setting my expectations a bit low. I still could not say no to the price. I have to say after getting them (and fast) my expectations were nicely exceeded. It was a great purchace.</li>
    <li> I have been using a double edge razor for years.  Have tried numerous razor blades, including Feather and Wilkinson Sword.  I have a very heavy beard.  These blades are the longest lasting, most comfortable blades I have ever used.  I shave every other day, now that I am retired, and one blade will last me 2 weeks.  Just replace the blade when you start to get nicks.  Great product, great price, and made in the USA.</li>
    <li> I tried the cheap blades that came with my shaver and they tore me up.  So i bought a pack of these hoping they would be a good alternative to the expensive Gillette razors.  I was correct, they work just as well but for less.</li>
    <li> Good but not out of this world. I got these on a whim and for its low cost. I give these credit as they do get the job done and are sharp. But to say they are as sharp as Feather blades is quite a stretch. With Feather blades, my face feels smooth and the shave amazingly effortless. These are similar but more aggressive on my face and cut is about two shades duller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say if you&#x27;re going through several blades a week then these are worth your attention. But my skin is sensitive and beard is light that I only go through a blade a week. The difference to me is mere pennies per week. Feathers are bliss to me and I can spot the extra dime each week for that.</li>
    <li> I use a safety razor and I take care of my skin. These blades do a great job without chaffing and at a great price. I&#x27;ve used Derby before, but these are much better.</li>
    <li> Not as good as Derby or Feathers, it just pulls hair instead of cutting.</li>
    <li> Shaves the beard well.  I am pleased with the sharpness of the blades.  I use them three times and replace them.  I could use them for additional shaves.</li>
    <li> Old fashioned blades are hard to find.  This box of blades should be enough for my 84 year old husband for a long, long while.</li>
    <li> They are fine, I&#x27;m new to using this system.  I&#x27;ll try another brand just to see.  They do give me about 4 to 5 close shaves per blade.</li>
    <li> Razors provides closer shaves</li>
    <li> For the money these blades are excellent.  I have not cut myself YET although others have reported that as being a problem.  The difference in razors that are 3 or 4 blades in one throw away razor is huge.  The Personna blades give me a very good shave and again the difference in cost is big for me.</li>
    <li> My &amp;#34;retro razor&amp;#34; is once again delivering great shaves with the help of these blades.</li>
    <li> I purchased both these and the feather blades and I&#x27;ve got to say - having tried both of them - I prefer these over the latter. The feathers are supposed to be sharper but I find these give me a more quality shave with less tug and pull. Overall I&#x27;m very satisfied with these and I purchased two packs. Looks like I won&#x27;t be buying razors for at least a year!!</li>
    <li> Extra sharp and long lasting. Is my preferred type of blade. Very reliable brand that never disappoints in doing a good job.</li>
    <li> I find these blades lose their edge after a single use and I need to pop a fresh one each time I shave. I have a fairly coarse beard. They also take quite a few nicks out of my skin no matter how gentle I am with them. I get much better value out of other premium brand blades and won&#x27;t buy these again.</li>
    <li> I think for the price, they are the sharpest blades out there.  I know there are others that are sharper such as Feather, but they cost more.  I have a thick beard and so if I don&#x27;t shave close my five o&#x27;clock shadow starts at 3pm!  But with a three pass shave and these blades (along with my Edwin J. razor), I have a close, clean shave that goes beyond work hours!  I never had that result with disposable razors.  So, if you want the very sharpest, Personna is debatable, but I believe that for the price they are sharper than most on the market including Derby and Wilkinson.</li>
    <li> I just recently bought these blades for my new Merkur safety razor. For me the blades seemed a little dull compared to the sample blade sent by Merkur. I am new at using a safety razor so take that into consideration, but the Merkur blade just seems to cut better. As much as I would like these to work ( Made in USA) I will be returning these for a refund...</li>
    <li> just a little too sharp. use them only in a Gillette adjustable or you will use a lot of styptic pencil.</li>
    <li> My husband loves them.</li>
    <li> Darn good blades that give a smooth shave for a good price. I&#x27;ll buy more.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let made in USA scare you away. Lovely blades, super value. Very happy with them.</li>
    <li> More cuts shaving in 3 months than I had in 30 years.&lt;br /&gt;Very bad blade quality.  NOT WORTH A PENNY.&lt;br /&gt;Austin, TX</li>
    <li> These blades were a decent value buy. I purchased these with my new safety razor as the cost was low and I wasn&#x27;t too committed to the safety razor yet. The blades work well, but there are some noticeable downsides when comparing to sightly higher quality blades. For example:&lt;br /&gt;- I found myself having to re-shave a few areas and also nicked myself a few times. I found that since the blades were not sharp enough, I wasn&#x27;t getting as close of a shave and also resulted in some nicks. After switching to the Feather brand blades, I found I was getting a smoother shave with less nicks.&lt;br /&gt;- There were also small imperfections on the blades (barely noticeable) as compared to the Feather blades. I will try to take a photo of this, but in my opinion it affects the quality of the shave.&lt;br /&gt;- There is a lack of consistency in the product; meaning from blade blade there are some noticeable differences. This does not affect the overall shaving experience, but in my opinion is an indication of quality control and product consistency, which would imply a less than optimal production process... Yes, I am over thinking this point but for those who care about quality...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you&#x27;re concerned about cost go with these blades as they are really not bad, just not the best. 100 blades at this price can last you a long time! But if you are going for quality, consider the Feather brand blades.</li>
    <li> awesome and at an awesome price. I have been using them with my new parker razor and am so happy with both.</li>
    <li> ok blade for the money</li>
    <li> Great razor blades for the money.</li>
    <li> I have a merkur safety razor and have used the standard merkur razor blades for YEARS. I didn&#x27;t really have any major complaints or anything, they got the job done... However, I recently saw these on Amazon and they appealed to me because of the growing number of positive reviews and the fact that they are american made. The price point/price per blade (15$ for 100) is much much better than what I was paying for the Merkurs... so I decided to try them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These blades are the bomb! They blow my standard Merkur blades away while costing a fraction of the price. These blades are SO smooth on my skin and shaving is much easier now. I usually knicked myself (minorly) at least once per shave with Merkurs , but I have yet to draw any blood with these bad boys. I have coarse/curlier facial hair and these Personna blades don&#x27;t skip a beat as they glide over my face. They also seem to last longer and retain their sharpness more than my Merkurs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this price point, these will definitely be my main stay now... I won&#x27;t be going back to merkur blades ever again.</li>
    <li> Recently I got very frustrated with shaving. EXTREMELY frustrated, in fact. Over the course of the last several years I have picked up various &amp;#34;razors.&amp;#34; All of them were multi-blades. The replacement blade cartridges were extremely expensive, and getting more so. If my wife bought me blades while she was out shopping, she might get the wrong ones. They are so expensive it sometimes made sense to just buy a new handle. But then one has multiple handles floating around the house. If I bought blades again there was a good chance I had a handle that fit them, but sometimes I didn&#x27;t. The plastic mechanisms that held the razor handles to the blades frequently broke and therefore the entire razor needed replacing. I None of the blades were universal. I felt manufacturers were involved in a scheme to milk me for as much money as possible. I was getting sick and tired of it. Plus, it was ruinous for the environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone mentioned an old school safety razor to me online, and I thought &amp;#34;there&#x27;s an idea.&amp;#34; The first product I looked for was these blades. I saw the cost, read the reviews, and saw they were made in the US. I nearly danced a jig! I buy American whenever I can in the vain attempt to preserve the middle class and our way of life. It&#x27;s a losing battle, of course. But I&#x27;ll fight it to the end. I decided I&#x27;d make the leap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found a German made double bladed safety razor at a reasonable price, and bought it and these blades together. It took me a few minutes to figure out how to get the Merkur safety razor together with the blades, but I did it. I began shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took a little getting used to. You have to figure out the angle, and one&#x27;s approach to shaving changes a bit. This takes a couple of days. HOWEVER, once the process is over you get a significantly closer shave than anything plastic, cheap, and made by slave labor provides. The shave is very close. The blades? They last a week. I spent this much on 5 or 6 plastic multi-blade garbage cartridges. That&#x27;s about 5 or 6 weeks. These blades will last me years! The cost savings is IMMENSE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor itself is metal and durable. My son who is eight could probably inherit it. The blades are cheap. The shave is better. The blades are made in the US. Multiblades are for suckers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll never go back.</li>
    <li> Great blades - great value. I change out about every 5 to 6 shaves and this has worked out well for me to maintain close shaves.  Recommend these blades for starting D/E shavers since they do not appear to yield as many inadvertent cuts and nicks. I have a medium to course beard. They also work well for me.</li>
    <li> Excellent blades. I love how smooth these are. I can get a good solid weeks worth of shaves from them with no pulling, etc at all. These have replaced Astra blades as my favorites.</li>
    <li> These are standard safety razor blades, but with my razor ended up being too harsh feeling, resulting in rash.  Several other blades have felt better for me, but it&#x27;s personal taste.  This box is still probably a good value for many people.</li>
    <li> Great feel on my face and always sharp.  For the price you can&#x27;t beat these blades.  I recommend them for anyone starting out with a straight razor or someone looking to try something new.  Great razors.</li>
    <li> They work its a good deal i would buy feather though these are not parallel and dont have the quality or special coating feather has.</li>
    <li> Good quality but way too sharp to use on sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure there are people that this blade would work very well on.</li>
    <li> Great product !  They stay sharp and seem to last forever.  I purchased 100 blades and may never have to buy a blade again.</li>
    <li> Well I guess I&#x27;m just having a blast. I tested the sharpness level of and reviewed  Feather double edge razor blades last week and then turned around and ordered Dorcos,  Derbies, Sharks, Personnas and Gillette Silver Blues.  I already had Astras and Wilkinson Swords on hand so didn&#x27;t need to order them again. I tested again with the same edge sharpness instrument that I had used to test the Feathers. The company that sells the sharpness tester (my instrument is the one designed to test straight edge razors) says that they are going to make additional test media available on Amazon and I may need it if I keep this up. I could describe the test procedure I used and make this review long and drawn out but won&#x27;t bore you with the details.  In a nut shell ;  while there appears to be some very small differences between these  various brands  in initial sharpness levels there isn&#x27;t enough to write about. This is as opposed to the Feathers that tested a full 40% sharper. Please don&#x27;t shoot the messenger!  I am not a Feather salesman. In fact, the somewhat anecdotal  preliminary tests I have conducted indicate that the superior edge on a Feather goes away very rapidly and much more rapidly than that of the less expensive brands but don&#x27;t chisel that in stone just yet.  Please keep in mind also that I tested only one product of each brand so it is possible that other models within the same brand might be sharper (or duller). If I come up with a good edge durability test I may be back because I&#x27;m just having to much fun with all this testing.</li>
    <li> they are ok.. I wished that it was the blue labs that looks like in the picture but I got comfort coated one which is white wrappers.</li>
    <li> I have been going up in blades as Gillette and Schick have been going back and forth.  2-3-4, 5 with an edger.  The Mach 5 is currently $39.88 for a twelve count - $3.32/cartridge.  The Mach 5 is probably a closer shave when brand new.  That being said at 3.32/cartridge I tried to make the cartridge last longer than it should.  The more you use the same cartridge the less smooth the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At 13.30 for 100 double edge blades - you could change a blade every 2 days and shave every day with a new edge - for half a year and 17 days  At $13.30 for the pack of 100 - that is 200 brand new blade edges for the price of 4 Mach 5 cartridges.  The new edge of these blades shave very close - just maybe not quite as close as a 5 blade.  Again - the tradeoff is at $3.32/cartridge you won&#x27;t be switching out the Mach 5 as often and your shave won&#x27;t be as close either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stop trying to make those expensive multi-blade cartridges last longer than they should. Old worn out blades probably causes more irritation than anything else.</li>
    <li> Like butter! I use these with my Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor. Will never go back to the expensive turbo 1000 blades that are way unnecessary to use. These do the trick, and well</li>
    <li> These are great razors.  I feel they are not as sharp as Feather blades, but certainly sharper than some.  I think they are a happy medium.</li>
    <li> What have I been doing wrong all these years? I&#x27;m almost 20 years past my university graduation and I&#x27;ve been using the Gillette line of razors since then. Boy do I feel RIPPED OFF. I purchased these blades along with the &amp;#34;Merkur Classic Straight Safety Razor&amp;#34; for a whopping $38.09. That&#x27;s $6.32 more than an 8-count of the Gillette Fusion Proglide replacement blades. Shaves just as close--if not closer--and the ROI is ON POINT. Would definitely recommend this combination to any of my friends.</li>
    <li> The blades are certainly better than others I have tried.</li>
    <li> I really like these blades money well spent. I get at least three to four shaves with these. And I shave my head and face. get a good smooth save with them. Will be buying again .</li>
    <li> Great price and fast delivery.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT BLADES --GIVE 3-4 GOOD SHAVES--AT THE COST OF 10 CENTS EACH--AND MADE IN AMERICA.</li>
    <li> I am middle eastern and have a thick beard. I have went through the feather blades which left my face very red and a ton of razor burn that made my face hurt to the touch for two or three days after. I tried the Gillette platinum blades and they were okay. I went through a sampler pack and nothing really seem to want to cut my beard and sliced through the hair. These personas are the best ones and I get amazing shaves and will stick with this going forward.</li>
    <li> Love the blades, give smooth shave without irritation. Excellent price, I will never go back to those expensive cartridge blades. The order was shipped fast, and without incident.</li>
    <li> these blades do just what they are advertise to do, I am happy with my purchase. They will save me money on the gillette mach 3 cartridges.</li>
    <li> I tried one blade so far and it seemed fine.  I used it for 5 days and it performed similar to other blades (more expensive) I bought in the past.  The one \\&quot;con\\&quot; is that you have to find a new disposal method as the blades are individually wrapped in paper (no dispenser to discard spent blades in).</li>
    <li> Great quality at a great price. I recommend this for anyone on a limited budget who want an introduction to safety razors.</li>
    <li> I shaved my face and my head with these blades. First time ever using a safety razor.  I had one minor cut on the back of my head but I think that was due to an existing ingrown hair or pimple.  I switched from a 5 blade razor to safety razor because I am tired of spending buttloads of money on razor blades and I am not disappointed.  The hair on my head was realistically too long to be shaving with a razor and it was still fine.  No irritation, just as smooth a shave as my 5 blade ever gave me and these blades are 13 bucks for 100.  I am completely sold and will not be switching back.</li>
    <li> This is the third brand I&#x27;ve tried, and I think I&#x27;ve finally found a keeper.  My beard grows in like wire and most blades catch (very painful) or leave hairs untrimmed.  These do a lot better.  They&#x27;re worth the slight price premium over other brands, and yet they&#x27;re still affordable enough that I can use a fresh blade each shave.  I suggest making the first pass with the blade from last time, then switching to a new blade for the second pass.</li>
    <li> Great price and great quality.  I replaced my Merkur blades with these and I feel they provide a slightly better shave.  I use one blade per three shaves, just like with my Merkur blades.  But, I could use one per shave since they are so inexpensive.</li>
    <li> I have tried many blades and have over a year of shaving with them.  I like these just fine.  Again maybe slightly below the Feather but at half the price they are a nice go to blade.  Try many different ones.  They all seem a little different and also makes a difference which razor you use them in.  ENJOY</li>
    <li> What else to say. These were my first blades so initially I had nothing to compare against.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried Feather blades, but switched back to Personna after three weeks.</li>
    <li> These are great blades, individually wrapped and packed in a small box. The blades are very sharp, rivaling Feathers, IMO, and are super smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried these in a Gillette Tech and a Gillette Rocket, and you need no pressure at all to get a great 3-pass shave. The blades last 5 shaves for me - I don&#x27;t try to push it, since blades are so inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sharper but a bit less forgiving than Personna Reds or Crystals. I would put them on par with Perma Sharps or vintage Kronas.</li>
    <li> Great deal on these blades. I am now stocked up with a supply for the next several years.....great value and I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Read lots of reviews about the many other blades available including the Personna.  Went with price, value, well known company, and made in USA.  Shaves well and lasts long.  Do not listen to all the hype, try for yourself.</li>
    <li> Works great with my  Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor, nice clean shave. No after shave bumps ether. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> A hundred razors?? How perfect and cheap is that? Really fine razor, and the price of this is the same as 4 cartridges for a Fusion. Glad I went to DE shaving.</li>
    <li> Wanted to like these since they were made in the USA, but unfortunately the blade sharpness doesn&#x27;t last like it does on some other brands.  There are better blades that last longer available for same price.</li>
    <li> Good price, good blades.</li>
    <li> The personna perform well.Smooth, sharp,without irritation.These are as good as it gets in my opinion in de razor blades.Made in USA</li>
    <li> This is the best all around blade I&#x27;ve tried. Excellent sharpness without being harsh, Good glide. No irritation even on 3 day, tough growth. I recommend giving them a try.</li>
    <li> These are great blades at a good price.  I made the mistake of ordering Derby (which I gave a two star review) a while back.  They lasted only a few shaves and I really had to hack away at my whiskers.  Personna blades are very sharp and I get a smooth easy shave.  That they are made in the U.S.A. is a bonus!  My only problem is I had to retrain myself to shave lightly because they are so sharp.  Personna I think has become my go-to brand.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these blades for a few weeks now.  I don&#x27;t get any irritation or razor burn with them.  They are very sharp and do a great job of giving me a smooth shave.  Much better than the Derby blades that came with my Edwin Jagger razor.  The box is small and the blades are individually wrapped.  I change my blade once a week and get 3 or 4 comfortable shaves from each one.  Best of all, they are made in the U.S.A.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I will add to my review once I&#x27;ve used them. Right now I am working through my disposables and have not bought a safety razor to use these with. Once I do, I will compare them with the disposable 4-head razors I am currently using.</li>
    <li> These are nice and sharp. They are standard so they fit my existing razor well, and they hold their edge for 3 shaves.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a first time user of a safety razor. Bought these after reading the positive reviews and I have not been disappointed. Great bang for your buck purchase. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> For me this may be a  life time supply of quality double edge razor blades.</li>
    <li> I have a feather razor and have been using feather blades. I use a badger brush and go back and forth between proraso red, lucky tiger and puck soap. I must say these blades give a fantastic smooth shave with my setup with no irritation or nicks. Great product for the cost and easier to get than Feather.</li>
    <li> I have tried variety packs and used Gillette 7 O&#x27;clock until I got these.  They are sharp, and shave my face closely.  I prefer them to all others.</li>
    <li> Great shave at a fantastic value.</li>
    <li> They work well in my EJ DE89.  They last 4-5 shaves.  I would buy them again.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical with the comfort due to inexpensive price. I am happy to report these blades are very comfortable.  That being said, I use both a safety razor and a straight razor (it uses replaceable blades) and these blades have performed above my expectations. Very satisfied!</li>
    <li> American made,sharp and a great deal.You will not find these razors anywhere at this price.I bought 10 blade pack at a local pharmacy and it was $7.99.They were good for 3 shaves.I got 8 shaves from these and its a close shave</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough how amazing these razor blades are!  They are the best of both worlds.  Extremely sharp but don&#x27;t nick your face at all.  Now that being said my safety DE razor is a Merkur long handle.  I highly recommend that razor as well as these blades.  If you are looking for a blade that works exactly the way you want.. The Personna&#x27;s are way to go :)</li>
    <li> Well, I can only figure that it really matters who is using the blade and, perhaps, what razor the blade is in.  These are very highly recommended on Amazon (and elsewhere).  However, it was carnage when I tried them in my Weishi 9306-F.  Yes, this is a cheap, Chinese razor, but it works just fine for me. I had been using Dorco ST300s and decided to give the Personna&#x27;s a try.  That was a mistake.  Ripped myself to pieces.  I tried my usual style.  I changed techniques.  I changed the blades.  No difference.  Bloodbath.  Went back to the Dorcos and all was well again.  Smooth and comfortable.  Either it is my face that doesn&#x27;t agree with these blades or the Weishi just doesn&#x27;t work with them.  I&#x27;m sticking with the Dorco ST300.</li>
    <li> I bought several brands to test out, and these are by far the best.  I get more shaves per blade than any of the other brands I have tried, and they are close and comfortable shaves as well.  I really have no complaints at all.  I have a couple other brands still yet to be tried, but I feel its unlikely they will sway me away from these great blades.</li>
    <li> Pretty sharp blades, with decent longevity. 4.5 stars</li>
    <li> Hard to beat for the price.</li>
    <li> These blades were touted by the seller as being &amp;#34;Just like the Personna Medical Blades&amp;#34; but they are a long shot off that claim...about the only thing in common with the Medical Blades is the manufacturer.  These are LAB Prep blades meant to be used to shave the arm hair off so blood can be collected.  They will shave arm hair great, but I have never met anyone with arm hair anywhere near the thickness of beard hair, so you can imagine that they do not do very well with thick beards.  I&#x27;m sure people will disagree, but these blades are downright unremarkable, and if i could i&#x27;d send them back and buy the real Medical Personnas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money...Buy the Personna Lab Medical blades.  You&#x27;ll get more and better shaves.</li>
    <li> These are by far the best razor I have used. Took one to my barber and he asked me to order 4 packs for him.</li>
    <li> Holds an edge better than most.</li>
    <li> I just got my first safety razor a few months ago and kept using the merkur blades, i have really sensitive skin and they occasionally left me with razor burn or didnt get all of the stubble, and i occasionally cut myself but that was more due to a learning curve. now these on the other hand are great and seem to last 2x as long as my previous blades with an overall better shave. ill never go back to cartridge shaving again!</li>
    <li> I have recently moved from the expensive rip off cartridge blades to DE shaving, these are the best blades I have used so far.</li>
    <li> The Good:&lt;br /&gt;-very sharp, not a feather but still quite sharp&lt;br /&gt;-very smooth, noteworthy given how sharp it is&lt;br /&gt;-provides a very nice shave in many common razors for many user types&lt;br /&gt;-a very good price point&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;-confusion, came with same box but plain white wrappers&lt;br /&gt;-confusion, printing on blades is different, no markings other than small type Personna and super&lt;br /&gt;-looks like a knock off?? and does not match photo&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ugly&lt;br /&gt;-the printing on the 2 blades I checked is poor, smudged and somewhat illegible, again looking like a knock off??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d go 5 stars on the good, if not for the bad and ugly, I do not think this is a knock off, but; why should I need to wonder?</li>
    <li> Great quality and American made</li>
    <li> Good blades with a good price. My are they ever sharp.</li>
    <li> These blades have performed very well for me. Blades provide a very close shave, I change them out after 3 shaves. I could go longer before changing, but choose not to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving technique is something you will refine as you learn the best way to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are more and less aggressive blades out there and you just have to find what work&#x27;s best for you. I recommend small blade cout purchases until you find what is best for your beard and skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me the persoona&#x27;s are excellent and a yrs worth if shaving for 13 or so dollars can&#x27;t go wrong and I get very close shaves with these. Multi blade shavers have not and do not provide as close shaves for me. I highly recommend these blades.</li>
    <li> I will buy again when needed!</li>
    <li> not as sharp so glides a bit more easily on skin</li>
    <li> these are amazing for the price.  i get 2 or 3 nice shaves out of each blade, making them wildly cheaper than any cartridge razor.  ...&amp; they&#x27;re american made, which is nice.</li>
    <li> Switched from Feathers to these.  Only difference, no cuts and I can put my alum stick away.&lt;br /&gt;Plus that they are made in America!</li>
    <li> these are the worst razor blades, I have ever used.  They are not sharp, at all</li>
    <li> Good blades-but not what I expected.</li>
    <li> they did not fir the Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor  that was suggested to go with them!</li>
    <li> Very sharp blades (used with Merkur Long Handle razor). I&#x27;m still (re)learning how to use a DE razor, but I&#x27;m loving the process. I will likely try a small order of Feather blades next (supposed to be sharper than these), but because they&#x27;re American made I&#x27;ll be keeping these on hand.</li>
    <li> Blade are fair better ones out there</li>
    <li> I use these with my Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor.  Great.  Very sharp and saves tons of money over time.  I get a much better shave than with any of disposable razors or the 3 to 5 blade razors I&#x27;ve tried in the past.  I won&#x27;t be going back.</li>
    <li> The blade is not working for me, my skin was irritated after 1 shave not sure what&#x27;s wrong with it.</li>
    <li> These blades are like using a week old disposable razor.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t cut myself with this blade.  Good product, close shave.</li>
    <li> Good blades for the price, they still don&#x27;t stay as sharp as I would like but that&#x27;s not very objective--your results may vary.</li>
    <li> The blades are American-made.  I thought that possibly the Swiss or Japanese blades would be better, but because the blades are so inexpensive I change blades after just three shaves and the Personna outperforms anything I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> Great way to save money on blades</li>
    <li> Great blades and a great price.  I use one blade in a little over a week. This will last me awhile.</li>
    <li> Razors work great and are sharp. They also last for a while.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done with no fuss, I&#x27;m getting 10 shaves on average before a need to change the blade.</li>
    <li> First things first:  * Buying American wasn&#x27;t a factor in my purchase (although it is a plus).  * I&#x27;ve been wetshaving for about 9 years.  * I don&#x27;t prep much.  Just a shower first, boar brush, shave soap, razor &amp; blade.    Feather blades have been my go-to blade for years.  These Personna blades are smoother than Feathers and possibly as sharp.  They work great in multiple razors I have.    If you are like me, you might be hesitant to buy these due to trying other Personnas in the past.  Well, let me tell you, these Personnas are a whole new breed.  For under $14 as of this posting, you can&#x27;t go wrong trying these.</li>
    <li> GREAT BLADES AT A GOOD PRICE. THEY GIVE YOU A CLOSE SHAVE.</li>
    <li> When I purchased what i refer to as an &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; type of razor I of course made sure to buy some extra blades to go along with it. What I like about these blades is the way they are stored in the box. They slide into position each time you remove one thereby avoiding having lose blades falling all over the place. Just take your time when you first open the box so you open it correctly. Now for the blades themselves I find them to be of pretty good quality and a very affordable prices as well. I have used several of them so far and have gotten between four and six shaves from each blade, not to shabby. A good razor needs good blades and I fell these blades are good bargain at a good price.</li>
    <li> I love a good, heavy, stainless-steel safety razor...I don&#x27;t like the plastic disposable-types with 17 blades that make your razor look like a spatula and buying those cartridges gets expensive.  Three blades, four blades, moisture strip, vibrating razor...who needs all that?  I typically buy the Wilkinson sword double-edge blades, but those can get expensive as well...100 blades will last a very long time.  These are your best bargain for the price.</li>
    <li> Cuts nice.  Havent had a bad one yet.  Seems to last a little longer than other brands</li>
    <li> not as sharp as id like</li>
    <li> Very good razor blades. Fit perfectly in my razor. I can use at least two times on my very coarse hair before I need to change the blade.</li>
    <li> really like these razors and for the price you can not go wrong very happy with product would buy again.</li>
    <li> The best you can buy.&lt;br /&gt;A good item long lasting blade.&lt;br /&gt;you get your money&#x27;s worth.&lt;br /&gt;Need a shave? Better look.see.</li>
    <li> Rating DE blades is not an exact science and is a matter of personal preference. I have tried many different DE blades and for me, these are as good as it gets. Matched with the Edwin Jagger DE89bl razor, they give a very close and comfortable shave and are my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; for my daily routine. YMMV</li>
    <li> Packing and delivery was excellent. The price was very good especially with the given quantity (100). Razor sharpness is very good up through three (3) shaves (depends on beard growth), and then I replace from there. Good clean shave; definitely save from the disposable, overpriced products out there. Would recommend and purchase again. Thanks, Me</li>
    <li> Very sharp and soft.  I tried a variety sample pack and didn&#x27;t like any of them.  These are by far the best...FOR ME.</li>
    <li> Great razor especially for new safety razor shavers.</li>
    <li> Made in The USA! Excellent value. I can make each blade last for about 5-6 shaves. After that, I like to throw the &amp;#34;dull&amp;#34; blades out by the bus stop and wake for the fun to commence.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with these blades.Price is right.</li>
    <li> Good blades, great price. I get a very good shave with these. Will not have to buy blades for a few years. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> As I have started shaving with an old-fashioned safety razor, I was initially confused with what blades to buy. The shark blades that came with my safety (A Parker 99r) just didn&#x27;t cut it. (Get it?) Anyways, I wanted to buy blades and not worry about them for a while. Two things appealed to me. 1. The price. at just over 12 cents a blade, I knew these were a great value. But what really set these blades apart was the fact that they&#x27;re american made. After a few shaves, and getting comfortable with safety razor shaving, I realized that these are going to be my go-to blades. I recommend these for anyone starting out. They&#x27;re not nearly as sharp as Feathers, but they&#x27;ll still get the job done, and save your face from those dreadful cartridge razors of days past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, no more Gillette Fusion, no more Dollar Shave Club, just stick with what my father started out with. No more wasted dollars. Just a buttery smooth face, and no more ingrown hairs (that was a big problem in the past). This should last me about 2 years, shaving 3x a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: it&#x27;s been about 2 1/2 years, and i still have plenty of blades left. While the change to traditional wet shaving was rough at first, and after going through many shave products, these blades have been the one constant. The only time i don&#x27;t shave with these is when I am short on time, and need to use my Fusion (sacrilege), but then again, shaving is a ritual, not a chore.</li>
    <li> Kept cutting me. I then tried Gillette Platinum and had no problems. YMMV.</li>
    <li> not even half way gone in over a year cant beat it.</li>
    <li> blades seem sharp enough for me</li>
    <li> affordable in that one can have a new sharp blade every shave</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get the high ratings? I bought these after I ran out of the blades that came with the Pawn Stars Micro Touch One razor. Those blades (don&#x27;t know the brand make) gave a much better shave and lasted at least a week or two before I needed to replace them. These \\&quot;highly\\&quot; rated blades can barely make it through two shaves with out dragging on my face.    Update: Due to being new to safety razors, my score of one star may have been to harsh so I&#x27;m re-scoring it with a more appropriate star rating, 3 stars. The Micro Touch blades where still better but again, not knowing the manufacturer there&#x27;s no way to recommend a brand to you.</li>
    <li> This is the best value in shaving today. These, with a double edged razor, (I use the One Touch Ultra), will give you as good or better shave than any of these multi blade razors do at 1/10th the cost. I saw a 10 pack of shaving cartridges for one of these 5 blade, name brand razors at my local drug store, and the price was $49.98! Almost $50 dollars for 10 razor blades. I could buy over 300 of the double edged Personna Blades for that price, and get just as good of a shave, and they will last for years instead of a couple of weeks. Do yourself a big favor and stop wasting money on over priced shaving cartridges, and pick up a good double edged razor, (Amazon sells several), and a 100 pack of these blades. You won&#x27;t be sorry, and your wallet will thank you!</li>
    <li> I am sure I have enough blades to last my lifetime</li>
    <li> These blades give me a comfortable DE shaving experience.</li>
    <li> I ran out of my usual plastic disposable four blade razors one day and remembered that I had an old school Merkur double edge safety razor tucked away in the back of the cabinet. I also found a few unused Merkur blades and used one of those for a week or so. The shave was a bit rough and I ended up cutting myself, which reminded me why I was never really impressed when I first tried them about 10 years ago and switched back to disposables. I decided to look for a different blade and read the reviews of these Personna blades and decided to place an order. I used my first Personna blade for almost two weeks straight and was amazed at what a great shave it provided. One hundred blades for about $15 equals fifteen cents per blade. One blade every two weeks so I am good to go for about four years of close, comfortable shaving, for the same price as about two months worth of plastic disposable razors. Cost is not the only consideration either. These blades are very sharp but I haven&#x27;t cut myself no matter how quickly I rush through my morning shave. These are great blades and an exceptional value.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best double edge razor blade I&#x27;ve used. And I&#x27;ve used other double edge razor blades from Merkur, Derby, Dorco, and Feather. Merkur was too dull for my tastes. Dorco was a bit too rough. Derby was average at best but did not irritate my face. However the Personna blades are the best of both worlds in my opinion. They shave as close as my Feather blades but without the the harshness of the feather blade so there is no irritation. The Personna blades shave close, but buttery smooth. I highly recommend them for those who like a very close, comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> very sharp, good blades</li>
    <li> Great razor blades! will buy again</li>
    <li> Great shave with this blade.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Not as good as advertised.</li>
    <li> Not as good as the German blades that are platinum coated. However, for the price not too bad.</li>
    <li> These are the first razors I have purchased as I am new to using this style of razor. I haven&#x27;t had a problem getting more than two weeks worth of quality shave out of each razor. At this rate I won&#x27;t need more for years.</li>
    <li> Good quality sharp blades! I will buy these again.</li>
    <li> Close, comfortable and smooth shave.  Plus they are made in the USA.  Very good price per 100 too. My #1 blade.&lt;br /&gt;Paul</li>
    <li> Great edge on the blade. Price was excellent. This purchase was well worth it. Will definitely purchase this product again in the future.</li>
    <li> guys, for everyday shaves - it&#x27;s an aggressive blade. I get nicks and cuts ( just a couple). I have a good Mekur DE long hand razor as well, and taylor bond street cream.</li>
    <li> Bought these to put in my MERKUR Bakelite Safety Shaving Razor (Model: MK030) and they work great. Very affordable too.</li>
    <li> Really like these blades. Don&#x27;t like the Astra blades, probably won&#x27;t use the 85 I have left.</li>
    <li> had been using disposables and the mach 3 and I prefer the shave I am getting now with the double edge razor blades</li>
    <li> These blades are great! They&#x27;re sharp and  give a BBS shave with no nicks or cuts. I change the blade once a week and that&#x27;s shaving everyday with them. Great blade for the price! Wasatch beauty has speedy delivery to! Great place to order from! After trying several  other brands these are the only blades I now use. And they&#x27;re made in the USA! Try then you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> i love these blade they are a close good shave the shave is amazing but the blades don&#x27;t last long. For the price its worth it though for the shave you get</li>
    <li> I have a medium beard with medium coarse whiskers.  I get three close shaves and replace the blade.  I have an identical experience with Feather blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try several brands and go with the least expensive brand that works for you.  That&#x27;s what I did and I am happy with what I found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
    <li> cheaper than regular blades, needs changing every 1 or 2 shaves IMO</li>
    <li> These blades shave very well and last longer than other blades I have tried.  I get about 3 to 4 good shaves out of them.  They are sharp. Yet, they do not nick very much. Most of all, they do not pull or leave my face as irritated as some others blades do.  Mine were made in USA.  I would definitely order these again.</li>
    <li> Very good blades sharp and smooth shave it gives</li>
    <li> Made in USA! Not as sharp as Feather Brand but they are made in USA. Excellent quality and they are made in the USA!</li>
    <li> These appear to be a good quality blade...This was a gift, along with the razor purchased...I am sure the recipient will like them...</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the fact that these clearly state on the box that they&#x27;re stainless steel yet they still stick to my magnet... regardless.. I was pleasantly surprised by the blades quality for the price! I stopped shaving for 5 days to test this brand out and it cut right through my beard without any irritation.. They&#x27;re not as good as my old blades by cooper.. but they sure beat the barber blades I&#x27;ve been using for a while now. I will definitely purchase these again</li>
    <li> Love these in my safety razor.  I have been using a safety razor for going on 7 months now.  I have become a fan of this, as I was using the Gillette Fusion, with 4 blades, I lost count how many they added.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that the safety razor lessens any razor bumps that I would have gotten after a week of shaving.  I personally have to shave every business day for work.  Sometimes I get the weekend off from shaving.  But, with the newer razor I would start to end of with razor bumps, no matter the preshave oils, or shaving creams that I used.  Its all from how close they get, and that they are taking the hair below the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first started with a multi-pack of razors, that included I believe 18 different brands or styles of safety blades.  I found that some brands did not work with my face or hair.  Causing me to get more nicks than normal. I would only need one try with that blade to rule it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now down to three brands and styles that I rotate between. The Gilette 7 0&#x27;clock Platinum, Personna Platinum, and Astra Platinum.  I find all of these work wonderfully for me.  And I personally only use them for 3 or 4 shaves, and then put a new one on.  The cost is so much cheaper than any other blades out there for the more modern razors.</li>
    <li> Great blades long lasting.</li>
    <li> Switched to these from Derby Extra&#x27;s, and couldn&#x27;t be happier. Smooth, close shave, and very few nicks. I get about 5 days out of a blade before replacing it.</li>
    <li> The blade feels dull. It&#x27;s more solid than Feather but not as sharp. I will definitely go back to Feather.</li>
    <li> Great value, good quantity. I get 3 shaves with each blade! 300 shaves per box!! Get the above razor and buy 3 boxes of blades and you all set!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Bought these as replacement blades for my Merkur and have yet to be disappointed. They have stayed sharp well longer than I would have expected. Even through those times I don&#x27;t shave for days on end.</li>
    <li> I have very heavy hair on my face and these cut through it np with no knicks I have them paired with a Edwin jagger de safety blade</li>
    <li> As we wet-shavers always say, &amp;#34;your mileage may vary&amp;#34; but I have to say this is a good value and good performer. This blade really starts feeling good after about 1/2 of the first shave on a new blade and then i get a good 3-4 total shaves. I usually do 2 passes with some touch ups.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve used too many different types of razor blades, so what can I say about these? They&#x27;re sharp. The packaging is good? I don&#x27;t know. They cut hair, so as that is they&#x27;re designed purpose, FIVE STARS!</li>
    <li> I changed back to the old style double edge blade  a month or two ago. I don&#x27;t know why I ever went to those expensive cartridge double blade&#x27;s , I Hate shaving every day, I am 72, about 4 or 5 days I shave, used to be with the other and those cheap throw away I would have to use my dog clippers to shorten the beard, then it was very unpleasant to shave with that new trash expensive blade, or throw a ways, cut my self a lot. well these take it off faster, no clippers before, wet my face and regular shaving cream in the can.&lt;br /&gt;the old blades and the next day I would have a pretty heavy growth, well shaved fri, today is mon and could shave, about the same growth the old blades had in 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;oh and I use a blade at least 4 times on heavy growth and the throw away&#x27;s wouldn&#x27;t last over one time and cut me. these cost about 10 cents a blades and  American made and rarely get a nick now. buy them great</li>
    <li> the blade themselves are good but I&#x27;m very disappointed with the opened box and missing blades.... Granted it was only 5 blades but anyone of us would expect a new unopened box. If you ask me that&#x27;s just customer service.....</li>
    <li> Blade choice is very much a personal decision, based on your specific skin type.  Having said that, this is a very sharp blade, but not as aggressive as let&#x27;s say a Feather blade.  I would say sharper than an Astra, definitely sharper than Merkur blades and the most forgiving blade out of all the ones mentioned before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great price, so it will not set you back too much if you do not like.</li>
    <li> I bought these for use in my safety razor and love them. They provide a great close shave with no irritation.</li>
    <li> These blades are often listed among the top DE blades in the world. A lot of folks like the idea they are made in the USA, too. These are often called Personna Blue Lab...even though the word \\&quot;Lab\\&quot; or \\&quot;Laboratory\\&quot; does not appear on the box. It is believed these are produced for laboratory use, not specifically for wet shaving.&lt;br /&gt;The small packs are believed to be not Blues, but the Personna barber blade, which is not as sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This blade has at least three major things going for it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Very sharp, amongst the leaders in sharpness&lt;br /&gt;2. Forgiving. Even though they are sharp, they are less likely to cause cuts than some other really sharp blades such as the Feather.&lt;br /&gt;3.Doesn&#x27;t matter to me so much, but many take stock in buying something made in the US. There certainly is a dearth of fine manufacturing in the US today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great blade. You most likely will not feel cheated by the shave. Of course, YMMV</li>
    <li> I bought a Feather shaver that had feather blades that came with it, but I like these better.  Why?  Because they aren&#x27;t quite as sharp and actually stay sharp longer.  For me the feather was too sharp and caused issues.  These are extremely sharp too, but not over the top like that.  They also are made in the good old USA, which actually means something to me still.</li>
    <li> These blades are last FOREVER!  I easily get 7 shaves where almost all other blades last 2 or 3 shaves.  These are smooth and VERY comfortable.  Easily the best blades I own.  They are as smooth and comfortable as Gillette Nacets and 7&#x27;oclocks but last much longer.  Superb value and MADE IN THE USA.  I own many blades and these are top-notch.</li>
    <li> Saving a huge amount of money over today&#x27;s multi razor prices and getting a much closer shave!  Each razor provides many shaves....it&#x27;ll be a while before I need to reorder.</li>
    <li> Awsome blades the best out there. Makes for a clean shave with no problems what so ever, it&#x27;s just a 5 start product.</li>
    <li> I really, really wanted to like these blades, mostly because they are apparently the only ones made in the USA. Unfortunately my first shave with one, in my favorite razor, was terrible. I threw that blade away and chose a new one the next day from the middle of the box. It was equally bad. I thought maybe it&#x27;s just not a good match for that razor, so I tried a new blade and different razor the next day. To make a long story short(er) after six blades and three razors I gave up. A lot of people seem to like these blades. Maybe I just got a bad box. I&#x27;m not going to buy another hundred to find out.</li>
    <li> Excellent blade that give a close shave. What a great way to save money too. Why throw money into fancy multi-blade razors that require costly refills? Why add all that plastic to the environment when these blades and a quality razor will do the job at a fraction of the cost! I purchased a well made razor and these blades for less than 50 dollars. The razor will last a lifetime and I can get a minimum of 500 shaves from this pack of blades. I learned to shave with blades like this, and now I realize the old way is the best way.</li>
    <li> Good price. I&#x27;ve used Personna razor products for many years. They are always competitively priced and good quality. I getting ready to use these after I run out of the Turkish blades.</li>
    <li> As sharp if not sharper than Feather blades.</li>
    <li> great value for the cost.</li>
    <li> These get the job done!</li>
    <li> Great blades made my face smooth</li>
    <li> Good blades, the best I&#x27;ve personally tried.  Light years ahead of the one which came with the safety razor which I was hell bent for leather on trying out. That being said, you&#x27;re going to get a much better shave using a fresh name-brand disposable.  I almost hate myself for saying it, but it&#x27;s the truth.  A single-blade solution is great if you&#x27;re into ultimate economy or have a penchant for nostalgia, but there&#x27;s a reason why time moves on and leaves certain things in the pages of history.  This is one of those cases.  I&#x27;ve given the safety razor and quality blades an honest 6 months to adjust to, and I find myself leaning back to the disposable two-blade with lubricating strip solution.  Disposables are the closer shave with fewer strokes, and leave you with far fewer reasons to break out the styptic pencil.  I wanted to believe - tried to believe - but I couldn&#x27;t be converted.</li>
    <li> This razors are super sharp and at this price you can throw them away after each shave. If your jobsite requires a fresh shave everyday this is the way to go. Why spend 5-8 dollars a piece for name brand razors when you can spend pennies and get the same shave. Additionally the single blade doesnt pull and tug so you get way less razor burn.</li>
    <li> Bought these blades as a wet shaving beginner.  I have never had an issue -- I never get snags or razor burn.  A smooth shave every morning!</li>
    <li> These are the best for my beard type, I consistently get a bbs shave with no irritation.  The perfect balance of sharp and smooth.  For reference my beard is thick but soft.</li>
    <li> Super sharp blades, good price, fast shipping.  I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> Not a huge fan of these. Tend to nick the skin more than other blades.  I prefer Astra.</li>
    <li> The price is excellent for the super sharp blades.  They come in a convenient package.  Made in the USA unlike other blades.</li>
    <li> I use a double edge safety razor for shaving.  I have tried a dozen different brands of blades and there is no doubt that Personna blades are the sharpest on the market.  I have never had a closer shave with any other brand.  Very, very highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, if you are used to cartridge razors and are just starting out with a safety razor, these may be tough on your skin during the transition.  They are extremely sharp, and it might be better to go with a different brand for your first few dozen shaves.</li>
    <li> I very recently made the switch to shaving with a single blade from using cartridges.  Having said that i ordered the edwin jaggar razor and a pack of these blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor came with some blades and so I used those first, but when I switched to using these i could tell a big difference. These are much sharper and seem to last longer.  however this is just comparing them against the stock blades, so there could be better ones.  However for the price the work great, and ill continue to use them.</li>
    <li> I like &#x27;em.  Have tried several brands and found these to be the best.  Very, very sharp and have enough &amp;#34;bite&amp;#34; to get through my tough whiskers.  I like to flip the blade over when I&#x27;m done with one side of my face.  Works great.  I do wish they had a tin like some of the store bought (and 100x more expensive) to store used blades.  I got an Altoids Mini tin, works perfect.</li>
    <li> came on time and my husband loves them:)</li>
    <li> Excellent sharp blade. Get a lot of shaves. Recommend.</li>
    <li> Blades do the job. I get 3-4 shaves per blade.</li>
    <li> Thanks to genetics, I need to shave only once a week.  It might take 4 years for me to use up ALL of these blades in this one pack.</li>
    <li> As good as other blades, and made in USA.</li>
    <li> These blades make for an excellent, close, comfortable shave!</li>
    <li> Great blades, I&#x27;m new to the DE world and wet shaving. Very sharp and comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> I do not recommend these blades. They are clearly cheap for a reason. Typically I can use one blade for 3 or 4 facial shaves if I clean my razor properly. With these blades you get a single facial shave before you need to change. They also frequently rip a hair out other than cut it. Save your money, get better quality blades.</li>
    <li> I can use a fresh blade with every shave and it&#x27;s still 1000x cheaper than any garbage cartridge. I&#x27;m still trying to find the right blade for my face, but damn, I still have like 1200 of these.</li>
    <li> My son-in-law loves these...says they are great.  Fantastic price.  Good brand.</li>
    <li> Just plain sharp.  For the price and for how many of these blades you get, it is just another reason to go away from the multi-blade disposable razors and start using these with a safety razor.  I just replaced the first razor I started using a couple of weeks ago tonight with another.  With 98 blades to go, this should easily last over a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested to see how good the used razor blade was after I replaced it and it still cuts through a regular sheet of paper like butter.</li>
    <li> only used it a couple pf times. So far, so good.</li>
    <li> Great value.  Sharp blades.  Great in my mueller razor.</li>
    <li> Not nearly as sharp as feathers, but more forgiving.  Doesn&#x27;t give nearly the burn off most other blades, but still gives nicks on occasion.  Overall, very happy with these blades and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> Decent blade for the price.  Cheap enough to use a new blade every time but good enough quality to use at least twice.</li>
    <li> This was a great value to go with the razor I gave my husband!</li>
    <li> I have used the Feather blades for quite some time now and they always seem to leave me a little bloody on occasion. I switched to these because I heard they weren&#x27;t as sharp and gave a smooth clean shave. I have not bled once since switching over and I seem to get a better all around shave and it never irritates my skin. If sensitive skin is an issue these blades might work well for you.</li>
    <li> Razor blades... what is there to say?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these blades for over three months now in a Merkur razor.  I change them out about once a week, sometimes longer.  I get a smooth, close shave, and the price can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
    <li> Great price for a large amount, nice and sharp, second order no problems</li>
    <li> Was a good deal. However edge seems a bit more dull than like astras. But, made in the USA is a big deal.</li>
    <li> Not to bash any other disposable razors like Derpy, but this is the way to go. I get two straight razor shaves when splitting them in half and using them in my straight razor or several shaves if I use in my safety razor.  They are nice and give me no drag when pulling across skin. Made in USA. This is a good buy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these razors for about 2 months now for shaving my face.  I&#x27;m in the military and a close shave counts.  The way I shave is once down and once across, with that said, the first time I use a new blade it is great, second day is okay and third day is rough.  This is the only set of double edge razor blades that I have used so I can&#x27;t compare.  But you can&#x27;t go wrong with the price and how many you get in a box.</li>
    <li> Great product. Made in USA.</li>
    <li> But don&#x27;t forget your styptic pencils</li>
    <li> TERRIBLE.  Waste of money.  You truly get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> i am very impressed with these. i actually ordered a sampler kit of different brands to find out which one worked best with my skin. these weren&#x27;t in my sampler kit but based on the reviews and price i decided to try them anyways. i was nervous they were going to have a bad cut and irritation, but they actually were the best double edge blades i have used! no irritation, no sensitivity, and amazing cut! when i finish this 100 i will be back for more!</li>
    <li> These blades are so sharp you wont believe. I am not sure how I missed these since I started shaving with Edwin Jagger. Just dont think and go get them The price is phenominal and what surprizing is I ordered at Amazon they came next day. How can Amazon manage such a wonderfull service at a rock bottom price. Long live Amazon!</li>
    <li> Shave well.  Made in the U.S.A.  Nuff said.</li>
    <li> Blades not as sharp as some other products.</li>
    <li> Great deal, beats the multi blades.</li>
    <li> INFINITELY cheaper than classic razors- my husband has been using a safety razor for almost 2 years now and I don&#x27;t think that he will ever go back to the inferior but waaaay more expensive disposable options. Plus, in 2 years we&#x27;ve bough 3 tubes of cream and about 3 of these boxes- so what, maybe $60 for 2 years of shaving? I feel like I went cheap getting a $100 razor and badger brush combo.</li>
    <li> Quality product with a great price!</li>
    <li> Great blades, smooth shavers.</li>
    <li> Years ago I used to be able to buy Personna DE blades locally at various drug &amp; discount stores. The only ones available for the last few years are the CVS brand for $5.49 per 10 pack or Studio 35 brand at Walgreen&#x27;s for $7.29 per 10 pack. Both show these are made in Israel. I assumed these were the Personna Red that some folks go gaga for. However, these blue box Personna blades give the smoothest shave I had in years. At less than .14 per blade these are excellent!    Update: With my Weishi TTO style DE razor I can get 4 shaves on one blade as long as I clean the razor and blade after each shave. However, the 4th shave is only just slightly less smooth so I now only do 3 shaves before changing blades. Why not? At .14 per blade it&#x27;s not an issue. BTW - only got 2 shaves with the CVS/Walgreen&#x27;s supposedly private label Israel Personna blades. These blue box Personna blades are incredible. Just like back in the day.</li>
    <li> I get the closest shave  I ever had and razor cleans up very well.I am very satisified.</li>
    <li> At  The present I have no razor to try these blades. The razor purchased with them was a disaster for me  Will  t ry a new razor soon</li>
    <li> These are my second favorite blade so far.  My preference is the Gillette Silver Blue, but these are right there in terms of performance.  I also haven&#x27;t had a bad blade in the pack yet.</li>
    <li> Great Deal. USA made!!!!!</li>
    <li> Great blades for me.  I&#x27;ve tried Feather, Merkur, Shark, Wilkinson, Derby (ugh), and a couple of store brands. The Personna blues are the best yet. They seem to be on-par with Feather with regard to sharpness, but without the irritation.</li>
    <li> Great blades, great price. For me they don&#x27;t seem to keep their edge as long as others I have tried.</li>
    <li> In an effort to save a few bucks and move away from the 4, 5, 6 blade razors, I picked up a single blade system.  These razors work fine.  I switch them out once a week, and get a perfectly good shave.</li>
    <li> These razor blades bring back the old times and they are exactly as I remember it is good to have them back in my daily routine.</li>
    <li> on time great blades.</li>
    <li> Great product! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many blades. Feather&#x27;s have been my go-to for about a year. Occasionally I use Astra&#x27;s which aren&#x27;t as good as the Feathers. My face actually really enjoys a Merkur blade but at $1 a blade I&#x27;ve decided to pass. I picked this up on a whim and based on the large number of reviews and I&#x27;m so glad that I did. Cheap enough for me not to care about the price of 100? Yup. Sharp enough to deal with my stubble but not to slice off layers of my skin with one pass?. Absolutely. They shave (for me) just like a Merkur blade at 1/5th of the cost. These are my new everyday blades. I&#x27;ll let the feather&#x27;s rust away in my cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with everything I have found in shaving, you mileage may very but I really enjoy them.</li>
    <li> I believe that every razor has a blade that works the best in it and on your face and whiskers. These may not be the sharpest blades out there but you can get a good shave... if you have an adjustable razor it is easy , turn it up until you get a good shave. Do not worry about the numbers, it is all about the angle of the blade and how the blades were made. It is time to take the magic and mystery out of DE shaving and use science. It is all about the angles to get that baby&#x27;s butt shave we are all striving for. To keep with the standard disclaimer... YMMV...  ENJOY</li>
    <li> I have a straight razor and now I have a full supply of razors which I split in half, for a very long time.</li>
    <li> Best shave I&#x27;ve ever had. Knew immediately these were the best blades for me, and I&#x27;ve tried them all. Plus, they&#x27;re made in the U.S.A. What more could you want?</li>
    <li> Pros: Sharp, smooth, durable blades&lt;br /&gt;Cons: none&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: these are sharp and smooth and are comparable to, and slightly better than, the Astra SP blades.  They cost a few cents more per blade than the Astras, but they also last a few days longer without rusting.</li>
    <li> This is a good razor blade. It is plenty sharp and gives a good shave. The only drawback I can see is that the packing does not provide a safe way of disposing of used blades. I am collecting them in a plastic jar which works.</li>
    <li> These cut me up! I don&#x27;t know what the difference is between these and the other blades I&#x27;ve been using [[ASIN:B001QY8QXM Astra Platinum Double Edge Safety Razor Blades ,100 Blades (20 x 5)]]. Whether it&#x27;s the coating, the angle of the cutting edge, that they are sharper or duller, I don&#x27;t know. I just kept getting cut.</li>
    <li> These are good blades. If you are new to saftey razors keep in mind these are double edged, very flexible, and sharper than a normal razor blade. This pack will last you the better part of a year if you shave correctly</li>
    <li> Dull and terrible blades</li>
    <li> Blades are nice and sharp for me.  Local barber shop uses the same ones which is why I went with them.</li>
    <li> Outstanding quality for price, 1 blade lasts 5 shaves for the thickness of my husbands facial hair and desire for a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you purchase the 100 count blades, it pays for its self instantly if compared to the cost of the triple blade, 5 cartridge pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the wife, I can see and feel a difference in the closeness of the shave, who would have guessed a single blade would outperform a triple bladed cartridge. This one does!</li>
    <li> I brought these razor blades to pare up with my Merkur HD. They do give a wonderful shave and for the price you can&#x27;t really complain. The only issue I have is they only last four shaves on me which isn&#x27;t bad but I tries stretching them to a fifth shave and wow that was a burning mistake.</li>
    <li> Though the name Personna was not familiar with me with wet shaving, I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot with the relatively cheap price along with the sheer amount. I&#x27;m duely impressed. I get just as close of a shave as I do with the big name blades for a fraction of the price. Plus if you change your blades as you should (weekly) you should have enough to last you almost two years. The only reason I give this four stars instead of five is they&#x27;re kind of hard to remove from the box without pulling them all out. That&#x27;s a minor detail though.</li>
    <li> The first 2 blades worked great and after that I have tried 5 different blades and none shave its like there to small so I had to but a different brand will see how they work</li>
    <li> Hunting local stores for blades other than overpriced double triple razors types is a joke ---decided to check here and was impressed that you had a supply. These are terrific blades and really hold an edge !  Delivery was super fast as usual , LOVE &amp;#34;Prime&amp;#34; --easy to justify the $99. if you buy online enough. Just the saving on gas and my time makes it worth it.</li>
    <li> so far so good.  have only used 1-2 to date though.</li>
    <li> thanks! great find at reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I like these blades a lot. They are sharp yet smooth and give a very comfortable shave. They also seem to be fairly forgiving. Not every blade works for everyone but, I recommend you give them a try. They&#x27;re also made in the U.S.</li>
    <li> The worst. For me.  Tried these. Worst shave ever. Massive pulling on whiskers and lots of cuts and irritation. I know blade experiences differ from person to person, but these did not work for me. Switched to Feathers and was like night and day. Gave the remaining 97 blades to a friend. Seller was great. Nice smooth transaction.</li>
    <li> Well-made and sharp.  We use these for a vibratome sectioning machine in lab, and they work really well.  We cut them down the middle and load them in.  We have been using them for years and the quality has held up.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I have several different brands of blades that I have in bulk (I don&#x27;t have problems with hardly any, just like some blades for certain purposes). However, this is my favorite to use. While it may seem like a lame reason, I appreciate that these are american made. I generally try to get american products (these are the only american blades that I have) and in this case it has served me well. The blades themselves are very very smooth on the face, even on the highest aggressiveness setting on my Merkur Vision. I highly recommend. (The packaging is also great, doesn&#x27;t waste plastic like every other brand).</li>
    <li> I prefer these blades to any others I have tried, but WalMart quit carrying them in favor of Wilkinson blades. This 100 count box will last you well over a year if you change blades infrequently, even if you have coarse, hard facial hair. I have been using the last box I bought for over a year now and am still nowhere near ready to order more.</li>
    <li> First of all, for $13 and change, you get enough blades to keep you going for about two years. Compare this with Fusion cartridges, which run about $3 each. This was one of the main reasons I switched to a DE razor -- and with the Personnas I&#x27;m getting a vastly improved shave. Blades seem to be a very personal decision; what works for one person may not work for somebody else. The best bet is probably to try a small number of several blades and see what works for you. In my case, the Personna provides a very comfortable shave, and I can easily get 7-10 shaves out of each blade. The blade also gets more comfortable after the first one or two shaves, which was a pleasant surprise.</li>
    <li> I not only use de razors to shave face but also my head and the Astra and Personna razors felt like I was using a cheese grader.....uugh.  Nothing more menacing than using blades that are inherently dull.  To sum it up I didn&#x27;t like them at all because they required me to shave with five to seven passes which still didn&#x27;t leave a smooth shave and really irratated my skin. The Personna blades were slightly better than Astra but both were truly unacceptable. I use a merkur adjustable futur razor, vulfix pure badger brush with Taylor of Old Bond Street Jermyn Street shaving cream.  The de razor which is working best for me so far is the merkur platinum de razors which require usually one to two passes and don&#x27;t irratate my face or head and last two shaves.</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery. Very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Razors are great quality and a good lot for the price.  I&#x27;ll buy them again.</li>
    <li> Great razors for a great price! A product of the U.S. that is equal or better in comparison to the higher priced &amp;#34;imported &amp;#34; disposable  razors out there.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t get quite as close a shave as I would like, but I also don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m going to decapitate myself using them and I get a much smoother shave than most.  I recommend them if you are starting out - by the time you&#x27;ve used up all 100 of them, you&#x27;ll be ready for something sharper.</li>
    <li> seem to be real good blades</li>
    <li> use one once a week. could go longer if needed.</li>
    <li> Great bargain for the price but these blades don&#x27;t last at all.  After two shaves the blades become very dull and begin scratching rather than cutting. I get better use from the disposable cartridge blades.  They are expensive but they last a lot longer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m into my 3rd year of double edged shaving.  My first year, I bought  a bunch of feathers based on the reviews.  Too sharp for me and sliced me up! So I bought a variety pack and tried a bunch.  I still didn&#x27;t love any of them.  I liked the derby&#x27;s and the red Personna.  I was getting mixed signals from the reviews of the red israeli&#x27;s so i decided to go with the blue.  My barber used these with a straight razor to shave the back of my neck at the end of the haircut.  They are certainly cheap and good for the price, but I&#x27;m not in love.  I still get nicks with these and it&#x27;s frustrating.  SInce I have the 100 pack, I change the blades more often because I am trying to get rid of them quicker!  I like them, but the shave isn&#x27;t extremely close and i&#x27;m still annoyed about the nicks.  As with any razor, your mileage may vary.  I&#x27;m still in the search for the perfect blade.  Unfortunately for me, this isn&#x27;t the one.</li>
    <li> For my face and light beard, this works as well as German Wilkinson Swordk Feather, Astra, Israeli Crystal or Dorco. I usually change blades twice a week no matter which brand.&lt;br /&gt;Dorco and Astra are a bit sharper but irritate and nick my neck. I compared all with same shaving cream and handle and prefer Wilkinson and Personnna Blue (&amp;#34;lab blue&amp;#34;) which are marketed to barber salons.</li>
    <li> these blades are excellent. last about 3 shaves but since there are so many, i toss it after just 2 shaves. if you want to save money on razors, ditch the plastic crap and opt for a safety razor with these blades!</li>
    <li> My go to blades.I havent tried all others but i get a great shave with these and with no nicks.</li>
    <li> Bought a box of these blades with a Merkur 42 razor.  Have not had any luck with them.  The Merkur blade that came with the razor was far superior and gave me half a dozen cut-free shaves.  These blades are much like the cover of Frank Zappa&#x27;s Weasels Ripped My Flesh album.  I would stick with Feather or Merkur blades.  I am glad that many of you do not seem to have had the same experience.  However, I cannot rate them as very good, or even good at all, and will be sending the partial box back to Personna.</li>
    <li> Super good price fast shipping</li>
    <li> Not as sharp or last long as Feather but for the money, it is just as good.  No irritations.</li>
    <li> My favorite blades (ive tried other popular brands). I have a pretty sensitive face and i think these are the best blades for me</li>
    <li> These blades are horrible, about as bad as Merkur blades. Not sharp. You&#x27;ll have to make multiple passes and each blade doesnt last long. Do yourself a favor and buy feather or Gillette silver blues.</li>
    <li> A fantastic blade.  I think this are comparable, but slightly better than Astras.  Super sharp and smooth.  I prefer Feathers a little more, but I have the thickest hair I have ever seen and like the extra sharpness.  However, I gladly use these- especially being so cheap.  If you want something a small step down from Feather blades- these are great!  I recommend them to everyone.  I also love that they are made in America.</li>
    <li> I cant get a good shave with these blades. I get razor burn really bad.</li>
    <li> Have not used Personna blades in years and was glad to see that they are still and excellent product.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Very good blades. Made in the USA. I might try the platinum coated Personnas next time, but a box of 100 of these is lasting a long time.</li>
    <li> I only use the Feather brand or Personna. They are very smooth and sharp for a nice shave.</li>
    <li> I just need to start off saying how wonderful these blades are.  The quality of these blades are excellent.  I have a very coarse beard and these just cut right through.  It&#x27;s not even like a hot knife through butter, it&#x27;s like a hot knife that just disintegrated the butter and vaporized it off the face of the earth.  I&#x27;ve tried numerous amounts of double-edged blades and these are by far the best.  I can use this blade 1-3 times, depending on how thick I let my beard grow, other blades I can only use 1 time before they become dull and rip my face apart.  You are definitely getting what you paid for with this product.</li>
    <li> works great. far cheaper than razor blade packs like gillette. This will last you years depending on how frequently you shave/change the blades</li>
    <li> Great close shave, and awesome value.  These blades performed better than other, more expensive blades.  I have trouble with ingrown hairs/razor bumps in my neck region.  I either had to settle for a less than close shave, or deal with tons of razor bumps before I found these blades.  Now that I have found these blades, I can get a nice close shave without the irritation.</li>
    <li> Does what I expected for a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Nice blades, sharp, last well (3 to 5 shaves is all I get out of the various brands I have tried), price is good, and they are Made in the USA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I keep the shaves to about 3, it is smooth, cuts very well, and no nicks.  I like what I said above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will leave the shaving idolatry and poetry  to others.</li>
    <li> I shave twice a week because otherwise I get ingrown hair. Even at that length, this blade is working, but not all blades are made equal in this package. Some are better than others. But most it does the trick.</li>
    <li> Great Value, Good Blades</li>
    <li> Good, reliable razors. Simple. Cheap. They work great with old-style safety razor. Highly recommend it in lieu of disposable shavers.</li>
    <li> Great price but only so so on shaving</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great to know that I&#x27;m set for at least a year of shaves thanks to this box.</li>
    <li> sharp and cheap. will buy again</li>
    <li> I like these razor blades, and I can find no fault with them. I put a new one in two different brands of razors. I then shaved one side of my face with one razor and the other side of my face with the other razor, I found that the blade did its job very smooth and very well even in two brands and style or razors. I found a difference in the razors themselves, but absolutely no fault with with the blades themselves. Another big, big, plus is the fact that they are made in the USA.</li>
    <li> This is a really good blade; which provides a very smooth shave compared to the other blades I have used thus far. (Merkur and Sharp). A nice bonus is that these blades are made in the United States; plus the price of these Personna blades is half that of Feather blades. I highly recommend these blades.</li>
    <li> Bought these blades because they we&#x27;re made in the U S A. Sorry I did I have a average beard shave every other day only get one good shave a blade next shave it pulls your beard and have to change blade.should have bought Willkerson blades.</li>
    <li> These are old school but still work just great and are cheap.  For those you retro guys, you need to try these.</li>
    <li> For someone who just started using a safety razor after nearly 20 years of using plastic disposables, I&#x27;m glad I made the change. With 100 blades I won&#x27;t have to purchase anymore for like 3 years, you can&#x27;t beat a deal like that vs what 8 bucks a month or more for mach 3&#x27;s. No thanks. These blades are a great deal and go well with my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Great blades, fantastic price and made at home.  I have read some complaints about nowhere to disose of the used blades; I took a small coffee can, put a hole in the lid, and I just drop them in when I change them.</li>
    <li> Not only do I shave with them, but I also use it to do general scraping of things like tar or glue.  It helped with removal of some very old window tint also.</li>
    <li> easy to use, no problem at all</li>
    <li> Good razor blades. I get about 3-4 shaves from each one. Can&#x27;t really compare to other brands, but good enough for me.</li>
    <li> The blades perform quite well.  I like that they are made in the USA.</li>
    <li> Very sharp. Maybe too sharp.  There are sharper and smoother out there</li>
    <li> These work great, done hesitate to buy.</li>
    <li> My husband thinks the blades are excellent.  High quality, great price and availability</li>
    <li> Excellent value for good razor blades for your safety razor. So far I&#x27;ve only gotten 1 bad blade (not as sharp) and I&#x27;ve used around 12-15.</li>
    <li> Great price, cut well and will last for a very long time.</li>
    <li> Closest shave ever&lt;br /&gt; No razor burn fantastic product&lt;br /&gt;will buy it for all my friends</li>
    <li> Good blade for everyday shaving. Cost per blade much lower than the Feather blades, however the Persona blades don&#x27;t provide as close of a shave compared to the Feather blades.</li>
    <li> of course, when it comes to these kinds of items, each person has a preference as to which razor works for their skin and if it works well with their other products. I can speak for myself, however, and say that these are probably the best razors I have ever used. The blades are very high quality and I do not have to replace them as often as I had to replace my previous brand of blades. the shave I get with these are very smooth, i don&#x27;t experience the annoying tugging that I&#x27;ve seen with some lower quality blades. I highly recommend these blades</li>
    <li> Nice blades.  I may try others when these run out.</li>
    <li> Sharp and inexpensive</li>
    <li> Always good to buy American products.</li>
    <li> Proves to be an inexpensive way to have a sharp blade every day.</li>
    <li> Best shave I&#x27;ve had with my double-sided safety razor. I started with Merkur, Platinum-Coated, and these non-coated outperform. Comes in a box of 100; miss my little case from the Merkur and the cheap CVS brands so I would keep one of those when you run out and use it. I have made do by putting the used razors in the new razors&#x27; wrapping and flipping them the opposite way to keep track in the box.</li>
    <li> Man I&#x27;m glad I went to a saftey razor,I save a small fortune on blades. These blades are sharp and made in the USA not China crap.</li>
    <li> These are fantastic for shaving more coarse beard hair! No issues at all!</li>
    <li> My husband is very happy with the blades. These will last him a long time. He shaves 2 x a wk &amp; a 100 will take somewhere between 2 to 4 years to use them all up.</li>
    <li> the blades are fantastic but I don&#x27;t like the fact that I don&#x27;t have any place to put the dirty blades</li>
    <li> Stainless steel, rather than high carbon, great edge, very sharp.</li>
    <li> was not as sharp as other brands</li>
    <li> Best blades for shaving!</li>
    <li> Good razors not a whole lot of pressure needed if any, razors are sharp. Little thicker than the feathers but as well</li>
    <li> These are awesome blades. I have the Parker SR1 Stainless Steel Straight Edge Razor and I really enjoy using these blades with it. I had the Feather blades and the shaves with them were not as comfortable as I had hoped they would be. I bought these and haven&#x27;t looked back. I can use one blade around three times before I need to replace it and that&#x27;s just me being picky. I&#x27;m sure you could go longer before replacing one if you wanted to.</li>
    <li> Great blades for the price. Each blade give a good weeks worth of shaves.  Three passes for a shave.  Minimal nicks and cuts.</li>
    <li> The blade is thicker and, thus, a bit duller than some of the other brands.  You can still get a close, and great, shave with them, but I did need to get use to it (Go slower and apply slightly more pressure).</li>
    <li> I like these particular Personna blades a lot but they are definitely a blade to be respected in the same vein as Feather. Be careful and mindful and they&#x27;ll do a much better job than most.</li>
    <li> This is a good value if you favor these blades. Unfortunately for me, I do not. I previously tried, and liked, a 10 pack of persona lab blues and thought that these were the same blades. I&#x27;m guessing they are not based on the change (drop) in performance. I&#x27;ve only tried two of the blades so far so maybe i got a bad one or two.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had a chance to use these yet, the razors I bought came with blades. I&#x27;m still using those.</li>
    <li> on time and no issues</li>
    <li> Could not use because the razor I bought to use it with was no good.</li>
    <li> Best blades I have found to date! Smooth doesn&#x27;t begin to describe the shave.</li>
    <li> Finally shaving like a man.  Been using Gillette for a while but this has improve my skin and hair maintenance.  I am African-American and our hair makes things complicated.  I love the smoothness this provides.  I can only imagine how it works for men without facial hear problems.</li>
    <li> Awesome blades at an awesome price.</li>
    <li> I have the double edge Razor shaving kit and this fits perfect in to it...! cheap too</li>
    <li> These are great.  Very sharp.  I have finally found my blade of choice, and I&#x27;ve been using double edged safety razors for over five years now, and have gone through so so many 20+ sample packs.</li>
    <li> Great shave and great price. These are also made in the U.S., which is a bonus.</li>
    <li> I decided to order a box of Personna blades, remembering how well they worked in Dad&#x27;s Gold Tech, when I ordered a Parker 98R razor from Amazon recently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I learnt to shave with my Dad&#x27;s Gillette Gold Tech back in the sixties. I&#x27;ve been using disposables for years, changing from one brand to another — the last being a Gillette Mach-3 three-blade. I&#x27;ve never had a really decent shave from any of them. My son mentioned he&#x27;d found an old safety razor when helping clean out a house and that he was delighted with the shave he had from it; that blades are a twentieth the cost of the &amp;#34;system&amp;#34; razors is even better for him. Yeah, that&#x27;s 5%, a 95% saving right there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forty-plus year old muscle memory worked just fine, I had a couple of nicks because I&#x27;d angled the head incorrectly, a touch of styptic pencil and a splash of after-shave solved that; I&#x27;ll re-learn the angles quickly. The Personna blade cuts whiskers faster than an International Harvester combine in a level wheat field.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first time in years where I trimmed my sideburns squarely with my eyeglass temples and evenly across. The blade shaved between the halves of my moustache and the remainder of my upper lip effortlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Personna blades, at $13.74 for a box of 100 blades are a bargain to a man who&#x27;s been spending about $29 for a package of ten Gillette Mach 3 blades. And, I add, the Personna blades give a much better shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t recommend the combination of the Parker 98R and Personna blades highly enough.</li>
    <li> These blades are really nice.  Not as sharp as Feathers, but really smooth.  They are also very comfortable and last about 4-5 shaves before they star tto drag.</li>
    <li> I agree with the other reviews that these are very good performing blades.  And for those that care about such things, I&#x27;ll add that these come in the best packaging I&#x27;ve seen so far for DE blades.  Some 100-blade packs are just 20 individual packages of 5 blades, each 5-pack in its own box wrapped in plastic, sometimes in plastic dispensers.  What a waste of packaging!  Have you seen the size of the [[ASIN:B001QY8QXM 100 Astra Superior Premium Platinum Double Edge Safety Razor Blades]]?  With this Personna 100-pack, each blade is in its own wax-paper pouch, but then all are 100 are squeezed into a box about 2\\&quot; x 1.5\\&quot; x 1\\&quot;.  Very compact and no plastic at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And of course, with a product made in the USA, the carbon footprint is probably lower since it isn&#x27;t being shipped across the planet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This liberal gives them two thumbs-up.</li>
    <li> Great blades, very sharp and last a couple shaves. I just got into DE shaving and couldnt be happier. I got a bit of minor razor burn on my first shave but havent since. Shipped quick and well packaged.</li>
    <li> Reasonably priced, very sharp blade. Works great in my vintage Gillette. Smoothest shave I&#x27;ve ever had. Good for about three shaves in my experience (mileage may vary depending on thickness of hair). Some blades may offer more, but I have yet to find one that was more consistent than this and with 100 of them you&#x27;re set for a long while.</li>
    <li> These razor blades simply didn&#x27;t work for me.  I have a moderate to tough beard and these tore up my face.  I tried several out of the pack just in case I got a bad one, but they were all the same.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> not sure if I&#x27;m just not used to using coated blades or what, but these cut me up worse than any blade I&#x27;ve used so far. but I gotta love them still cause they&#x27;re made in &#x27;merica and that&#x27;s beautiful.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried many blades but I have zero issues with this one so five stars</li>
    <li> Only can get one or two good shaves from each blade. But at this price I guess who cares</li>
    <li> These blades are sharp! They don&#x27;t rust easily, and I can get a good shave for about a week on one. Do shave slowly and gently, as these will cut you. At least for the first few shaves. I remove the blade after each use and clean and dry it. As it is much easier than when it has dried on. I won&#x27;t ever buy the many blade throw aways again, as this pack of 100 will last about 2 years!</li>
    <li> they fit my razor, work good, only used two so far in three week period. don&#x27;t cut face as old cheaper ones did.&lt;br /&gt;price is reasonable.</li>
    <li> These were great for my sensitive skin. I don&#x27;t have problems with razor burn anymore and I can use these 4-5 times before the blade needs changing. I shave about every 2-3 days.</li>
    <li> A great blade with a smooth edge.  The blades in a container of 100 count are by far a cheaper way to shave vs buying the throw aways.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how many times you are supposed to shave with these. With that said I have had many brands that would last me 5-7 good shaves. These come in such a large quantity because they are really only good for about 1 good shave. I won&#x27;t be buying these again unless I am broke and absolutely must.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several different blades (Derby Extra, Merkur, Treet, 7 O&#x27;clock, Feather, Shark, Astra, Blue Bird, etc).  Feathers are hailed to be the sharpest.  I beg to differ.  Not only are these blades sharp, but I find them a bit smoother and easier on the skin than Feather&#x27;s.  Of course, my skin was irritated after 4-5 passes, but, who&#x27;s wouldn&#x27;t be?  After some lavender witch hazel and Truefitt &amp; Hill 1805 Aftershave Balm, my skin was good-to-go.  If some find this too harsh, try using a good pre-shave oil such as Geo Trumper&#x27;s West Indian Limes Skin Food.  Stay away from The Art of Shaving pre-shave oil because it has the consistency of Castrol Motor Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ONLY would recommend these for those who are comfortable (have experience) with double edge shaving.  These blades, like Feather&#x27;s, are NOT FOR BEGINNERS!  Seriously, these are so sharp you can injure yourself and not even know it because they cut so smooth.  I usually throw my blades out after 1 use, since DE shaving saves me money anyway.  So I&#x27;m not sure how these will hold up after several shaves.  You should through your blades out after every shave because bacteria and nasty stuff can grow on your blades, which may cause further irritation, an infection or an overall bad shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just an FYI that a sales rep in a very popular shave store in Chicago informed me that these are the blades they use to &amp;#34;dry shave&amp;#34; (no lather) your hair off your body right before surgery.  I laughed but after using these blades for the first time, I can believe the story!  These are made in the U.S., I believe in Virginia.</li>
    <li> The blade is very smooth and does not irritate my sensitive skin. Way better than the 4/5-blade crap.&lt;br /&gt;Sharp enough that I do not have to warm my whiskers, and it doesn&#x27;t leave a razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plenty of blades for cheap. Inexpensive, great to shave with, do not irritate - what else can a guy want?</li>
    <li> Originally I thought these blades were platinum coated.  It doesn&#x27;t state that they are platinum coated in the Amazon write-up but I found them on other sites as well ... and on some of these they were touted as Personna&#x27;s premium platinum-chrome coated blades ... which is exactly what I was looking for.  So I bought them based on that misunderstanding.  However upon first shaving with them I immediately sensed that they didn&#x27;t have a platinum coating.  So I contacted Personna directly and asked if the blade&#x27;s coating was indeed a platinum chrome coating.  The answer I received was that they were not.  The Personna communication likened the coating to a Teflon type coating. Here is the email:&lt;br /&gt;******************************************&lt;br /&gt;From: \\&quot;JewellPatti\\&quot; To: \\&quot;trade_winds_47@yahoo.com\\&quot; &lt;trade_winds_47@yahoo.com&gt;Cc: \\&quot;BroganRandall\\&quot; &lt;rbrogan@energizer.com&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full Headers Printable View&lt;br /&gt;Dear *****,&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for your interest in Personna DE blades.  Platinum chrome is no longer used in our coating process.  However, we do use a chromium coating along with a proprietary secondary coating which gives the blade a \\&quot;teflon\\&quot; like surface.  This allows the blade to glide with smooth, clean precision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any additional questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With best regards,&lt;br /&gt;Patti  *******&lt;br /&gt;*********************************************&lt;br /&gt;I ended up giving the blades away because for me a platinum coating is absolutely necessary.  Any blade that isn&#x27;t platinum coated is painful to my skin.  For me there&#x27;s just a \\&quot;bite\\&quot; to the shave that any non-platinum coated blade inflicts on my skin.  I remember when I first discovered platinum DE blades (I believe it was the \\&quot;Platinum Plus\\&quot; blade that first \\&quot;graced my face\\&quot;) ... it was such an immediate relief the first time I first used that platinum coated blade.  I&#x27;ve been married to a platinum blade ever since.  Adding chrome is welcomed ... not because I thinkit adds to the blades comfort though ... but I think it may add to blade life.  In the past I&#x27;ve found that I can use Personn&#x27;s platinum-chrome blades for 2 months per blade.  At this point I&#x27;m not sure how long a platinum only blade will last me ... but I will know before too much longer as I&#x27;m beginning testing on an Astra blade now (and I&#x27;m 8 days into that test as I write ... this morning will be the 9th day).&lt;br /&gt;However ... if you are not a person who finds the same relief from the addition of platinum to a blade as I do then I would think in that case that you might not have a problem at all with these blades.  Except for the lack of the platinum coating I don&#x27;t see anything at all wrong with these blades and in my opinion they perform as well as any non-platinum coated blade that I&#x27;ve ever used ... and maybe better.  But for me personally the \\&quot;glide-coating\\&quot; just doesn&#x27;t do the trick.  Anyway I hope this information helps you in your quest to find \\&quot;the blade of your dreams\\&quot;!  Happy shaving!  And \\&quot;shave on\\&quot;!</li>
    <li> These blades have just the right amount of aggressiveness to give me a close shave and still be gentle on my face.</li>
    <li> Saved a LOT of money compared to when I was purchasing Gillette Fusion Razors. Really sharp and lasts more longer than what I expected. Well worth the purchase!</li>
    <li> Very thin and performed to the utmost satisfaction. It was a really enjoyable shave this morning.</li>
    <li> Good quality blades.  I have been pleased with the edge and quality of these blades.  Great value.</li>
    <li> These razor blades do exactly what I hoped they would do. They cut my beard without carving up my face. I am very happy how quickly they arrived and how well they shave.</li>
    <li> I have a strong stubble with delicate skin. Derby and Merkur have been my usual blade choices. Personna has been a nice substitution (not to mention the price is a whole lot better). I&#x27;ve been using them for a bit now and I&#x27;m happy with it! I do think they are slightly duller and can tug just a bit more (or maybe they go dull faster?) so the blades don&#x27;t last as long as other blades I used. For the 100 count at about $13, you just can&#x27;t beat the price even with fewer shaves per blade.</li>
    <li> Works excellent and cuts as expected.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still a newbie to double edge shaving, and learned about Personna from WireCutter.com&#x27;s recommendation.  But I was mistaken -- they were recommending the Israeli made red-label platinum Personnas, which are reputed to be much sharper than these.  Also, I belated discovered after purchasing these, as a newbie, everyone recommends trying out lots of blades to find the best match for your razor and face before setting down and buying 100 (which at the rate of one blade a week, should last two years). But, now that I&#x27;ve tried a few other blades and have some comparison, these blades are fine -- pleasant, friendly, not too sharp nor aggressive. Not the closest shave, but among the more comfortable, and the less expensive, and thus a good deal.  They certainly shave better than my old Gillette Sensors.</li>
    <li> These blades last me 1 week befor I need to replace it, they are milder than the ones I was using before -they give a close shave. I will buy these again</li>
    <li> Shaves smoothly, holds their edge and they are cheap.  Every you could possibly want in a razor blade.</li>
    <li> These is best blades I have every purchased.</li>
    <li> Double edged razor blades that fit every known double edged razor, Made In America, 25% sharper, 100 blades at $13.75 &#x3D; $0.14 per blade...if you use one blade every four shaves that&#x27;s a little over $0.03 per shave. I use mine in both a 1947 Gillette Super Speed, a 1967 Schick Krona and a brand new Merkur 33C...one of which will out last any new cartridge razor and two others that already have and still will:)&lt;br /&gt;Great blades that give a smooth comfortable shave at a fantastic price made in America.  Throw your 3/4/5 blade gimmick razor that costs more than it was ever worth along with those $1.65 - $3.50 each cartridge blades in the garbage and get a better shave cheaper with a tool that will last a life time if you take care of it.&lt;br /&gt;Save money, support American labor, get a better shave.</li>
    <li> you will never use a disposable again!</li>
    <li> This is my first purchase of blade of this type. The shave with these blades was smooth and I did my first shave with this type of shaver with no nicks or real irritation. They are very sharp coming out of the package and stayed sharp for the duration of the shave. I throw them out each use, I don&#x27;t know how well they hold for multiple shaves, though at the price why would you risk it.</li>
    <li> Not the sharpest so it&#x27;s good for beginners (unlike feathers which WILL cut you are not super careful).  I find them dulling after 1-2 shaves and doesn&#x27;t seem to respond as well when you flip the blade over.  But for its price, I rather just keep changing out the blades every shave.</li>
    <li> Great blades....Little better than Astra, not as sharp as Feather.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t nick myself as much as I do with Feathers, which is a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;These don&#x27;t have the two spots of wax on them like Astra blades have, I think these are the&lt;br /&gt;best all around blades I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Those are blades! I am going to used this for ever. This my BLADES, I used to wilkinson Blades. But I always had some irritations some where, and cut off myself, blinding as Hamburg. My first time in my life to have a very close shave and blinding . It is today. Those are the blades you need to have for a perfect shave. I will definitely recommend those blades to anyone who wants to have a perfect and close shave.  Many thanks to Amazon and Personna double Edge Razors for such a great jobs they have done, across a country and around the world.</li>
    <li> Good for shaving, made of metal.</li>
    <li> Great blades at a great cost. These were the first ones that I bought when I started using a safety razor over a year ago. I&#x27;m in the military and have shaved everyday and still using the original box.</li>
    <li> These have no edge for a new blade.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t understand the 5 stars? I threw it out after the 1st shave and replaced it with a Feather blade.</li>
    <li> switched to personna from wilkinson sword, using a 1971 Gilette adjustable.  i have a heavy beard and these are sharp and smooth.  great blades, recommend them highly.</li>
    <li> I shave myself every day and I&#x27;m saving money. Every blade last 6 days before getting dull.</li>
    <li> These Personna blades are wonderful! As I am a new user of this brand of blade, I decided to try a couple of tests.They produce fine results on my beard (moderate hair growth, sensitive skin) when shaving every other day, and also everyday. No nicks or roughness after seven consecutive shaves either way. In fact, I probably could have gone another shave or two without problems. The price is quite reasonable for the quality. These are double edge razor blades that I will be using for quite a while and would also recommend to friends as a great value. Individually wrapped, I have no fear of rusting over long-term storage and, in fact, will soon order another box or two for back up.</li>
    <li> these double edged blades earn you the risk of poor shaves, coupled with additional nicks and cuts. stick with your favorite safety razor system. had to give it a try though.</li>
    <li> Great blades. Do you remember the Personna 74. Great shave.</li>
    <li> Arrived on-time. Good blades.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t mind a bloody neck then go for it. Whether it was installing a fresh blade &amp; changing shave lotion/creams it didn&#x27;t matter.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have much experience shaving with double edged razor blades. These were my first choice. I like them very much. I cannot tell that there is a blade in the razor at all for the first three shaves or so. After that they become slightly &amp;#34;tuggy&amp;#34; but even then they will get the job done without cutting you. I have very coarse facial hair and I typically do two full passes while shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are they good blades overall? I don&#x27;t know because of my lack of experience. The only thing I can say for sure is that I prefer these over derby extras. Other people online who have compared these to other blades seem to like them a lot as well. Given that you can get 100 blades for less than the cost of a pizza, I would say but them. Lots to gain, nothing to lose.</li>
    <li> THE PRODUCT MET ALL OF MY REQUIREMENTS. THE PACKAGE WAS COMPACT,EASILY STORED AND HANDY TO USE. I BOUGHT IT FOR MY HUSBAND.</li>
    <li> I have bought these before and was concerned that the ones I just got were &#x27;not right&#x27;.  The printing, box, wrapper on the blades and even printing seemed different/lesser quality.  Despite seeing some &#x27;questions answered&#x27; I contacted Personna directly and got two quick, thorough and polite answers to my questions (I even sent them pictures).  Bottom line, this popular MADE IN THE USA product has white paper wrapping now, and they know their printing on the blades isn&#x27;t up to their standard.  A new machine is being installed eventually but they run the one they have full blast due to the popularity of this MADE IN THE USA (sorry) product.  I find it is sharp enough, durable and love the packaging as it saves space.  I&#x27;ll keep using them and now know that we&#x27;re getting the real deal at a fair price.</li>
    <li> These work great in my Micro One Touch. Looking forward to lots of savings and great shaves  from a quality American-made product.</li>
    <li> They give me a very harsh shave although after around two shaves they do tame down a bit.  I&#x27;ve put them in a Fat Boy, an Ambassador, and a Merkur adjustable and they just don&#x27;t work for me.  I guess I&#x27;m a red Personna or a Dorco guy because these work good for me.</li>
    <li> Made in USA, no rusting.</li>
    <li> these are very sharp and work great just be careful when using and they are very reliable</li>
    <li> I love these blades. After trying pretty much every blade on the market, these provide very consistent results. Not as sharp as feathers (which is good, one wrong angle with a feather and you have a nice cut on your face). These seem more forgiving, made in the US, and at a great price. I don&#x27;t even reuse blades anymore. It&#x27;s nice to start with a fresh blade everytime to avoid any possible contamination.</li>
    <li> Amazing blades. I upgraded from derby blades a month ago and have not looked back. Shaving started to be a nuisance with the inconsistencies that I found with my big box of derbys. These blades are amazing. The derbys would last me 3 shaves on average, with noticeable tugging after the first shave where these blades last me 5 shaves and feel great even on the last shave. My facial hair is not very rough so of course results may vary.</li>
    <li> Enjoying the blades so far. I&#x27;m getting about 5-6 shaves per blade ymmv</li>
    <li> These blades now come in a white wrapper and are not as good as the previous order of Personna blades in the blue wrapper.  Not sure if I got wrong blades, or if they changed, but they are not as sharp and are causing irritation.  I cannot return (a couple weeks late...) so I will toss.</li>
    <li> Light and Sharp. Well worth the $$$.</li>
    <li> Pros: Sharp, plentiful, cheap. Apparently made in the USA? (Hey, we actually manufacture things!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Could be sharper? Unable to cut holes in space-time using blade.</li>
    <li> it cut my whiskers off. Yes it did it job.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been 5 months and I still have many blades to go. These are pretty sharp on the first shave, but they dull quickly. Each blade lasts slightly less than one business week if I shave every day. For 10 bucks, I get to shave for a year. What other brand can beat that?</li>
    <li> Just recently joined the growing trend of Men reverting back to the Double Edge Razor. Received a pack of Merkur Blades with my Razor and also bought a pack of Feather Platinum Coated Blades. Tried both of these and found the Feather blades to be surgically sharp and a little too dangerous for me, almost pulled a Van Gogh. The Merkur blades were not as sharp but, I felt like I was taking extra strokes to accomplish the job. I thought about buying a sampler but I really felt 6 or 10 blades was too much to try and then really recall what I liked. So I saw where another Gent had bought these Personna blades and mentioned that they were Made In USA and are very reasonable. Tried it and it worked very well for me. Not too sharp and no extra strokes needed. I change blades every week not because I necessarily have to but, it just assures me of a nice shave. No more shaving with a dull $3 cartridge blade because it costs too much to toss.</li>
    <li> I’m relatively new to the whole old-fashioned wet-shaving business so I decided on the Personna brand over the supposedly dangerously sharp Feather brand blades. I don’t know how these compare to the Feathers, but I do know that these are smooth shavers! These cut my tough whiskers with little-to-no drag and without any irritation. I have yet to nick myself with a Personna razor blade. For me Personna is the best brand that I have tried; they’re sharp enough to effortlessly cut my stubborn whiskers without being so sharp as to cause razor burn/injuries. Everyone’s face is different, but if you’re like me I think you’ll like these razors.</li>
    <li> Something has changed. Went from best to worst blades. Different packaging and can&#x27;t get a decent shave.</li>
    <li> hubby loves going back to the old way of shaving.....much cheaper then buying those expenive razors.  He said the shave very nicely</li>
    <li> Awful.  I&#x27;ve been wet shaving for months now and have used Merkur, Feather, and Wilkinson Sword blades.  I was interested in the Personna blades because they are affordable and they are Made in USA.  I am HUGELY disappointed after trying them.  They must not be very sharp because they were pulling like CRAZY on my whiskers.  I could only make it halfway through one shave with this blade it was so uncomfortable to use.  I swapped it out for a trusty WS and was amazed how much more comfortable those blades shave.  I shave every day and have a light beard, so there really is no excuse for these blades shaving so poorly.  Do not buy!  I am returning this 100 pack after only half of one shave.  UPDATE:  I returned these to Amazon in exchange for a 100 pack of Wilkinson Sword blades.  The WS blades cut SO much better than these.  They even work OK on a dry face!  I will point out that one advantage of these Personna blades is the tiny box they ship in.  It&#x27;s about 1/10 the size of the box the Wilkinson&#x27;s came in.  The DOWNSIDE to this is that you don&#x27;t get the plastic boxes for disposal of your blades with Personna.  You&#x27;ll have to come up with some other way of safely getting rid of the blades.  To put this whole thing in perspective, 100 blades is about a year&#x27;s supply for me.  For an extra $5 a year, I was able to get a VASTLY better blade from Wilkinson Sword, which includes the plastic 5-blade packs which are convenient for travel AND safely allow you to dispose of your blades.</li>
    <li> There are a lot of good blades out there. That does not mean they will work for your beard. My beard is bristly. These are the best blades that I have found. Smooth and close shave.</li>
    <li> These are really sharp blades</li>
    <li> These blades are a good value.  They cut well and stay sharp.  I only got a couple of shaves out of the first blades i tried, and these i can use all week.</li>
    <li> good product / good service</li>
    <li> I have been shaving with a DE razor (Merkur 34C) for almost a year now.  Bought these as part of trying out the Personna line up.  Not the absolutely most comfortable blade I have ever tried, but certainly plenty comfortable and delivers an excellent shave.  I get 4 shaves apiece out of these, and for the price, these cannot be beat.  This is 95% of the Personna Med Prep performance for less than half the price.  Money no object, they are my third most favorite (Gillette Silver Blue and Personna Med Preps are #1 and #2).  Factor in money, and they are the winner by a landslide.</li>
    <li> These are the best sold by Amazon. Better than Feathers and Derby. Don&#x27;t waste your time with Dorco--too dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And they&#x27;re American made to boot.</li>
    <li> These were purchased for my husband.  He loves them, says they&#x27;re very &amp;#34; smooth&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> Works well for my heavy beard. Much less expense than those drugstore razors! A few months ago I switched to brush and soap method too and won&#x27;t be going back.</li>
    <li> Even if you use a blade for two shaves cost in blades is minimal as compared to the new multi blade razors, and the shave is just as close.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only tried three brands. These are every bit as good as Merkur blades, better than Dorco. I get about 3 weeks out of a blade shaving daily. I could probably get more.</li>
    <li> Great product, fast shipping</li>
    <li> Bought for Husband. He thinks they are great.</li>
    <li> Works as well as the Feather brand and these are made in the USA at much lower cost.  No fancy packaging to store the used blades is the only downside.</li>
    <li> Really sharp blades on the first use. I usually can hear stubble being cut with most blades, but on the first use with these the razor just glides without a sound. I can get four or five shaves with these.</li>
    <li> I used a ton of different razor blades, for the price and quality of the shave you can not beat the Personna</li>
    <li> These blades exceeded my expectations for two reasons. First, they offer very close shaves, easily trumping the Gillette Mach 3 I was using before. Secondly, they are easy to use. The first few shaves were a bit bumpy, causing a few minor nicks around the jugular. This was due mainly to me applying to much pressure to the blade. I&#x27;ve since relaxed my hand and use less pressure, basically eliminating all nicks and irritation.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t know problem, but husband says cut chin trying to use and used to always use this type blade</li>
    <li> personna blades have always been good to my face, but not so easy to find at the store.  Now I can shave as often as I want.  These blades stay sharp longer than others.  I can get two close shaves. With some others, just one.</li>
    <li> only can get two shave on these blades and cut is not smooth</li>
    <li> Great blades and well worth the price.  I&#x27;m back to old school shaving and will never return to the modern crap that costs  fortune.</li>
    <li> Different blades seem to work differently in different razors.  A bit of trial and error is advised - and part of the fun.  These did not perform perfectly (though not terribly) in my Merkur long-handle.  But I put one in my 1960s-era Gillette super speed and, man, I was struck with the smoothness and ease of the shave.  Easily one of the closest shaves I&#x27;ve had with a DE.  Great price and consistency.  USA-made is nice.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> The more you read reviews about blades, the more confused you are likely to become. The same blade that is praised by some is scorned by others. Finding the right blade comes down to trial and error.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the shortcomings of most reviews is that the blade is simply graded by that person without any context or prior blade usage being provided. You&#x27;re unable to determine whether that person&#x27;s experience or shaving history match yours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that in mind, here&#x27;s my attempt. I consider my beard tough, albeit patchy. My skin is extremely sensitive, especially on the neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a sampler pack when I began wet shaving. I started with Merkur and then moved to Bic. Both blades caused irritation and felt uncomfortable. I can&#x27;t dismiss that my inexperience played a role in this discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I moved on to Derby. This blade proved very comfortable and the irritation disappeared. I knew that Derby was a &amp;#34;forgiving&amp;#34; blade, and one of its drawbacks was a supposed lack of closeness. I was willing to make that tradeoff for comfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest problem with Derby involved &amp;#34;quality control.&amp;#34; The blades lacked consistency. I&#x27;d get close shaves with some, only to get the opposite with the next blade used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read about the Personna &amp;#34;Lab Blues&amp;#34; and gave them a shot. These blades are called &amp;#34;Lab Blues.&amp;#34; They differ from other Personna blades because the word &amp;#34;Super&amp;#34; is stamped on the blade face. Similar Personna blades have an arrow design stamped on the blade face. I&#x27;ve tried those as well. They lack the comfort of the &amp;#34;Lab Blues.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These blades provide the necessary closeness without the tugging and irritation. Just to make sure, I went back again to test the Merkur and Bic for comparison. The Personna blades were far more comfortable and effective. I&#x27;m done searching for the right blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this history helps and that you find your best blade.</li>
    <li> Fit and work great and I get a great shave.</li>
    <li> Like shaving with a laser. Great blades</li>
    <li> Wow! What a nice shave.  I normally use Feather blades but was looking for something a bit less expensive and easy to get locally.  I ordered these figuring the worst I could do is shave using one everyday until I used them up.  I did not expect them to be on par with the more expensive Feather blades I normally use.  But they really delivered a great shave with my Merkur 34c.  I found the Personna to be slightly less aggressive than the Feather&#x27;s but they cut through my beard smooth as silk.  No fuss, no muss.  I don&#x27;t know how many shaves I will get with a blade but even if it is 2-3, for $12 I will have no gripe.  I am very impressed with these and intend to buy more when I run out.  I do wish they came with a good plastic dispenser but again at this price I will mute my complaints.  The main thing is they give such a smooth shave the minor concerns can easily be set aside.    I know each beard is different and these might not work for everyone, but in my case they were a perfect fit.  Great product at a very affordable price.</li>
    <li> very well packaged....quite sharp......someone wrote in a previous review that you can take the paper cover off the blade and it does not stick to the blade which is quite annoying.....will definitely reorder this item...a good value for the price</li>
    <li> These dull so much faster than the Mercer version... but they&#x27;re so much cheaper. After trying both, I&#x27;ve landed in the spend more and use the Mercer razors.</li>
    <li> Sharp blades good quality I will buy again when I need. Ladies if you choose to use these be very very careful as you can get cut easily.</li>
    <li> They work great. Reason I gave it a 4 out of 5....Because I had nothing to compare them to.</li>
    <li> Excellent blades - highly recommended.</li>
    <li> These are sharp and work well.</li>
    <li> These are simply the best ones you can buy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with these blades.  They may not have the best display properties but they do stand out in quantity for price.  I&#x27;m not an &amp;#34;I only buy American&amp;#34; consumer, but if they put out an equal product at a similar price I prefer to try.  These definitely meet that criteria.</li>
    <li> I got these because of all the rave reviews I had heard.  These are not bad blades, but imo the shave quality is very similar to those given by Dorco blades.  Of course, you can&#x27;t really go wrong with the price point on these.  I will continue to use these, but since I&#x27;m looking for sharper, I think my next purchase will be Feathers.</li>
    <li> The blades are sharp and last longer than other DE blades I&#x27;ve used. I can easily go 5 shaves on a blade before I toss it.  I use them in my Edwin Jagger and my Merkur with very good results. This combo gives me a better shave than my old fusion razor at a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> Great blades. I can go almost 2 weeks before changing blades. And made in the U.S.A, get the 100 pack its a better deal.</li>
    <li> I have been experimenting with several brands to see which one is best for me. Without a doubt, i get the best shaves with Personna blades. Yes, there are other 100 blade packs that are cheaper, but whats a few bucks over a year or two ( I shave every day and change blades weekly). An excellent blade, and the fact you are helping American industry is a winning combination.</li>
    <li> These blades are very good blades, and they are made in the USA. I like that. I get seven good shaves from each blade. I could get more, but it is such a good price, why push it?</li>
    <li> These are by far the best blades that I have ever used. The price is right, the quality is great. I would recommend those blades to everybody.</li>
    <li> Sharper than Shark brand. The feel of the blade and the super-smoothe face after proved this product for me.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong. Shark blades are pretty good; I&#x27;ve been using them for the last 2 years. These are sharper. I am very pleased I made the switch!</li>
    <li> Great blades.  After years of using feathers, I decided to give the Personna Reds a try then switched to these blues.  I use a Fatip Grande Open Comb and have had super smooth shaves with the blues and reds.  I do not notice much of a difference between the two but for the price, I will stick with the blues.</li>
    <li> These blades are a huge step down from my feather blades.  These blades tend to tug at my stubble and they irritate my face whereas feathers are smooth and slice through the stubble with ease.  Feathers allow me to complete a fool&#x27;s pass above the upper lip but these blades leave an irritated bloody mess! It may have something to do with the packaging, as feathers come with glue to hold the blades in place inside the wrapper.  These personna blades did not have any glue dots to hold them in place, so the cutting edges may have been dulled with friction rubbing against the wrapper.</li>
    <li> FITS GREAT INTO MY SHAVER AND WORKS AWESOME CLEAN AND NICE CLEAN SHAVE SO IF YOUR THINKING ABOUT IT DONT JUST GET IT</li>
    <li> These Personna blades are really uneven: some fresh ones right out of the package are terrible and tear up my face; others are fine and good for 2-3 shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least they&#x27;re cheap enough I can use them for a single shave and toss &#x27;em afterwards, but I will not be buying more when I finish with this package.</li>
    <li> Great Product will order again when needed</li>
    <li> what a buy! much better deal then those expensive blades. one blade shaves just as well as those multi plastic blades at a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> Holy sh*t. Razors are dangerous. We need to regulate on who can buy these.</li>
    <li> Gives me a perfect shave every time!</li>
    <li> These DE Razors are great. I have both Astra and these are pretty my top choice. Until i buy some feathers these are my top choice.</li>
    <li> These are good, inexpensive double edge razor blades for those wanting to use a safety razor for shaving. I bought these to replace some other double edge razors from another company that came as starter blades for the handle I am using. I selected these because the price was good and they are made in the USA. They do an ok job, not terrible but not great either. The other blades I used I could get more shaves out of before they were too dull for my liking. These Persona blades, to me, just aren&#x27;t as sharp right out of the package. I want my blades extra sharp so as to minimize drag on my face. These are just ok for that first shave, maybe another two or three at most but after that I felt like I needed to change the blade out. I know that they don&#x27;t last forever so maybe I am being too picky, but I have used other blades so when I compare to other brands, I wouldn&#x27;t buy the Persona again. I didn&#x27;t waste a ton of money so I don&#x27;t feel too bad about the purchase.</li>
    <li> Great blades for the price.</li>
    <li> Sharp, plentiful, cheap!  The three hallmarks of a worthwhile razor!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Persona brand blades for around 15 years now. I think they have the BEST QUALITY. I found that DERBY blades are CHEAP and they RUST in my razors. Other blades were NOT as SHARP as these blades. I use them with the Persona Brand Straight Razor as well as ALL of my safety razors and I have 5 different brands including the German adjustable that everybody is raving about. I have a review for that too.. Anyways Good quality Blades. Great sharpness and price..</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t use these to shave with, but I needed an alternative to a $130 reed knife for my oboe reeds. Decided to try these, since they were inexpensive and support American labor, which I am all for. They work well for clipping the tips and sides of reeds, not as well for scraping the windows. But, of course, that is not what they are made for. They are very sharp, and seem like they would make for a very close shave.</li>
    <li> Great blades. My milage on these are 3 shaves. Other people get more.</li>
    <li> Works well with my Merkur razor. Replace within three uses to reduce risk of cutting yourself.</li>
    <li> I have used a double edge razor now for over 30 years. I have bought a wide variety of blades, all of which performed well. Just to let you know, I have a light beard and can resuse the same blade for 5 or 6 shaves and not have any issues. These blades however are the worst blades I have ever used. In fact, a brand new blade cannot even cut a piece of paper and it literally caused such shave rash that I had to quit shaving for 4 days. That was using both sides to try and get a close shave. If you are like me, you can read my review and see all the positive ones and take a risk if you want. I have never wrote a review on amazon so this tells you how bad they were.</li>
    <li> I am almost 60 years of age and have used this type of blade for over 40 years.  I don&#x27;t like electric razors. A few years ago I decided to try Mach 3 blades.  The Mach 3 blades are great but too expensive so I moved back to these.</li>
    <li> Smooth shaves not as sharp as a feather blade but with this one you can go over places on your face without worrying about irritating your skin.</li>
    <li> good blades. 100 will last me several years</li>
    <li> good bbuy for the money. get 2-3 shaves per b lade</li>
    <li> The  best blades on the market! Smooth, sharp and very comforable. My go to blade!</li>
    <li> Can only use each double edge blade once. Each side becomes dull after first use. Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Great value for money, pairs up well with slant Merkur, made in USA, what else to ask for.</li>
    <li> these type razors are the greatest</li>
    <li> Husband loves these. It is our second time ordering and couldn&#x27;t be happier with the product or shipping time to receive it</li>
    <li> This is my favorite blade. 6 months later and I am still on the same pack.</li>
    <li> I was a Feather man until I tried these. These are surprisingly smooth, and adequately close enough to Feather sharpness. A very reasonable cheap alternative to the expensive Feathers, which at this moment costs like 27,28 dollars and you have to wait 1.5 months for it to arrive by boat from Thailand.</li>
    <li> The blades seem fine but the whole single razor process seems more trouble than it&#x27;s worth.  I don&#x27;t know if the blades are the problem but the razor didn&#x27;t smoothly shave, it tugged and pulled at my hairs.  I went back to cheap disposable razors from the 99cent store.</li>
    <li> They work great! Why did I wait so long to stop using cartridge razors? They work fine with the Merkur Long Handle Safety Razor. I&#x27;ve been using them for about two years now. I walk by the razor isle and laugh......</li>
    <li> Good quality and inexpensive, a winning combination.</li>
    <li> excellent! very close shave and so much cheaper than those disposable razors that run about 2.50 a piece. They arrived much sooner than expected also</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t really work as spoken of.</li>
    <li> I guess you could say I practically collect safety razor blades. I have Sharks, 7 o&#x27;clock, Silver Blues, Big Ben, Wilkinson, Nacet, Nacet Platinum, Bic, Merkur, Derby, Astra, and of course Feather Hi-Stainless and Platinum coated blades. With this, I feel I can offer a decent comparison but never let one person&#x27;s opinion alone dictate what you buy. What works for me, might not work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My initial impressions are that I was expecting a blade to offer something like the Astra blades, which are my favorite. Instead, I got a blade that was decent and forgiving but didn&#x27;t exactly stand out. That isn&#x27;t to say it&#x27;s a bad blade. Far from it, but I expected this to be among the best blades and I was left feeling like it was just slightly above average.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The image of the blades on Amazon look slightly different. The branding in the stock photo looks very nice but when you open up the box you can see that the blades are branded with a rather worn out stamp in black ink. These worn out stamps just smear the Personna name on the blade and you barely even make out what it spells. I think the blades would look better if they just left their blades unbranded. These blades have no wax dots so that&#x27;s something. I know some people get annoyed with it gumming up their razor but I&#x27;ve never had much trouble with wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blade is forgiving. This is no feather but it&#x27;s still pretty sharp with the added benefit of showing mercy around my chin area. Astras excel around my chin and Adam&#x27;s Apple while Feather blades are just looking for a reason to cut me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given the cost of a 100 pack I would say they&#x27;re worth it. It&#x27;s not the sharpest blade nor does it have the durability and superior overall performance of the Astras but it&#x27;s still quite pleasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may have come off as critical but I tried to be as nit-picky as possible so you know what you&#x27;re buying. You may not care if it&#x27;s the sharpest or has the best branding. That&#x27;s fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally I find this blade to be a jack-of-all trades. It&#x27;s a blade for those who haven&#x27;t yet gravitated to a particular brand yet that appeals to their niche hair and technique. I think this is the blade that should come standard with all DE razors. It&#x27;s great for beginners and veterans alike.</li>
    <li> I read a lot about these blades but they didn&#x27;t come in the sampler packs. So I took a chance.  They are great.  Sharp but durable.  One lasts on my beards 8 shaves.  But I clean the blade, strop it on an old pair of jeans and put a drop of almond oil on the blade between shaves. I have a feeling I&#x27;ll be using these from now on.</li>
    <li> Not the sharpest blade out there, from what I understand, but they are not the dullest I&#x27;ve tried, either; they&#x27;re sharp enough to give a very good shave with a Merkur Futur (which is an adjustable razor).  I am new to DE shaving (less than six months) and am in no way a blade connoisseur; regardless, I like these blades better than the Dorco and Merkur blades I&#x27;ve used.  The Personnas are available at an excellent price (my cost was less than $0.15/blade delivered), and I&#x27;ve found I get three &#x27;new-blade quality&#x27; shaves (at three passes per shave) from a new blade, with minor degradation in shave quality for two or three shaves thereafter.  I&#x27;ve used a single blade for up to a week, after which the shave quality dropped off.  The price is low enough to use each blade just a few times to maintain optimal shave quality for a nickel or dime per shave.</li>
    <li> I get about 2-3 shaves for each one which ends up being one a week. Much happier about using these compared to expensive alternatives.</li>
    <li> Exactly as I expected it to be</li>
    <li> I must have gotten a bad batch. Every-other blade is dull and pulls on my hair. I will immediately throw this blade out and the very next blade in the pack will glide like butter, like its supposed to. What gives? The only thing I can figure is this company had a batch of bad blades and figured they would slide them into these larger package sizes in hopes no one would notice. Will not buy again. Should have gone with Feathers.</li>
    <li> My main motivation for buying these blades was the fact that they were made in the USA.  However, after my first shave I will not be changing back to Sharks or even worse Derby&#x27;s.  These blades felt great on my skin and left me with a fantastic shave. The packaging is different from the 5 blade canisters you find in most, but the added room in my medicine cabinet is welcomed.  If you are on the fence, jump in, the quality is there and the price is more than reasonable.</li>
    <li> Doesnt feel as sharp as my $0.79 10pk no name blades.</li>
    <li> shared with family, close shave</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a great experience with these blades so far!</li>
    <li> great price for product</li>
    <li> Great bargain. Work as good or better than much more expensive blades.</li>
    <li> Great product your really cant go wrong with it just make sure that you know that these are SHARP so if your not used to shaving with something this sharp then dull em out by rubbing the blade on a piece of cork or something a few times first. but really no complaints. It came in a smaller box then i pictured in my head for 100 blades but hey smaller means less room to take up. I would recommend this product and plan on buying more in the near future!!!!!!</li>
    <li> great blades.great price...throw away your multi balde razor and get these...way better shave.</li>
    <li> My review is on the full experience of buying, receiving and shaving. These blades shipped very quickly to me and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the transaction process. However my one complaint is that I&#x27;m not sure I received the correct items.&lt;br /&gt;It is possible that personna has changed their blade wrappings but the picture here shows the &amp;#34;lab blue&amp;#34; wrapping that I have seen from many other sites and sellers and consumers. But when I opened the box each was wrapped in a plain white paper, and some had a much less clean and different looking emblem printed on the blade instead of the nice looking blades shown in the picture. I would love to know if I received some generic blades or a knockoff of personas lab blues that I really wanted to buy, or if they have just changed their process.&lt;br /&gt;The shave: ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! I have tried several blades, being new to wet shaving and DE shaving, and these are my favorite by far. They work very similar to the Gillette Silver Blues but without the price tag almost being double. They last me on average 6 shaves per blade, very nice close shaves. Even using some random soaps that don&#x27;t give the best protection, they are smooth shaving and non-irritating no matter how aggressive the shave. I should also mention I use the Merkur 34C.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am very impressed with the blades, I would give a full 5 stars if I knew what was up with the packaging. I don&#x27;t want that to sound unfair, but anyone could print the box or just reuse the box and sell some random blades they make/have, or they could be a lower grade than the Lab Blue blades that I was told I was ordering. I will update with a full 5 stars once I find out I have received the correct product. Also going to try to add a photo just so you guys can see. And if anyone else has had this issue and can help me out, please do!&lt;br /&gt;Your results may vary!  But I highly recommend personna.</li>
    <li> Not as wide as my razor, a Jagr.  Found out the hard way when I had a strip of hair on my face after shaving.  They were inexpensive and quite sharp for several shaves.  Probably wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Only brand of razors I know of that offer bulk packaging like this. Part of the reason I switched to safety razors was to cut down on the plastic waste, so buying a hundred blades in sets of 5 or 10 with plastic cases seemed counterproductive. This packaging is very compact, and the blades are just individually wrapped in wax paper. Blade quality seems good, though I&#x27;d suggest getting a small pack of Personna first if you&#x27;ve never tried them. Everyone likes different blades.</li>
    <li> Excellent shave with these. I replace them every shave but could probably get 2 shaves out of them. There&#x27;s no need to work with a slightly dull blade though considering the price of these is dirt cheap compared to the massive ripoff of those multi-blade razors sold in the stores.</li>
    <li> Sharp razor blades works well and a lot cheaper than disposable razors.</li>
    <li> Nice blade smooth shaves</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better blade.  Sharp, held the edge.  Each blade was individually rapped.  The product arrived very quickly.</li>
    <li> These are (oddly) not consistently sharp.  Some are sharp enough, others are dull.  Most are very unrefined edges and result in cuts.  The only reason to buy these over &amp;#34;feather&amp;#34; brand blades (which are consistently good) is if you&#x27;re one of those senselessly patriotic &amp;#34;buy american&amp;#34; people.</li>
    <li> Tried many blades, these and the personna reds are my favorites. Cheap enough to change the blade once a week.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin, and as a black man am very susceptible to ingrown hairs. I find these blades do a nice job without irritating my skin too much.</li>
    <li> Good item, good price.</li>
    <li> Tired of spending $4 for a cartridge razor?  This is the solution.  I tried these with a Merkur safety razor for the price of a couple months cartridges.  It has taken me about  months to get good at using them (expect some nicks!).  For the price of three cartridges, I have at least two years of razors.  I like using the soap and brush, and honestly it&#x27;s kind of cool to shave like my grandfather did!</li>
    <li> Very good blades, nice and heavy. I will buy these again maybe in a year or so when I run out. I was using Shark razors before this but honestly can&#x27;t tell too much of a difference. I like the box design that doesn&#x27;t take up much room and that they are made in America, to me those two things are worth a couple extra bucks spread over a year or so worth of razors.</li>
    <li> Great blades, I&#x27;m not likely to run out in a *very* long time, MUCH more affordable than the Mach 3 or other contemporary shaving options.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive and a great value.  Good on my scraggly beard for 3-4 shaves but cheap enough to toss after one.  Go for it, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I get about 3 good shaves off of each blade. I am saving soooooooo much money my using this method of shaving.</li>
    <li> Great safety blades. Sharp, reasonably priced and made in the USA.</li>
</ol>
