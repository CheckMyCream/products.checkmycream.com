<li> When we received these brushes and opened the box there was such a foul odor it nearly knocked me over.</li>
<li> Got these maybe a few months ago and so far no shedding!</li>
<li> Too bad because the brushes are quite nice.</li>
<li> Brushes shipped to me faster than expected, like a week or so earlier than the estimated</li>
<li> I was a bit concerned about how long they would take (the shipping notice said not to expect them until sometime in January</li>
<li> The 5 smaller ones are eye brushes (small angle brush, pencil brush, rounded blending brush, angled blending brush, flat shadow brush), but the flat one can be used for concealer.</li>
<li> The little kabuki I carry in my makeup bag for touch ups; it&#x27;s not very dense compared to the larger kabukis, so it can work for blush, bronzer or even highlighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> i have absolutely no complaints about these brushes.</li>
<li> oh and there was minimal shedding when I received them but after a wash they have not shedder since</li>
<li> The only down side is that you cannot buy these individually and there are not more types to choose from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Bought these for my daughter because the other ones that I got her at Target kept loosing the bristles - these</li>
<li> One of the powder brushes just had half of the bristles fall out</li>
<li> I have quite a few Sigma brushes and these are comperable in quality.  </li>
<li> I have purchased brush sets before and there would always be a few brushes within the kit that I would not use or had a purpose for, but</li>
<li> I bought these a few weeks ago and use them every day.</li>
<li> You&#x27;d be crazy to pass them up.  </li>

    <li> the brushes are super soft!!!! and the shipping was extremely fast!!!

    <li> So.. one night I was kicking around the internet and saw an amazing brush set sold by a company in the UK.  I wasn&#x27;t feeling their price and I was talking with another one of my makeup artist buddies and she put me onto  these brushes.  I was a bit concerned about how long they would take (the shipping notice said not to expect them until sometime in January but they&#x27;re already here!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered a set for my personal brush stash but I love them so much I&#x27;m getting more to use on my clients.  HIGHLY recommended.  And at THIS price?  You&#x27;d be crazy to pass them up.  Super soft, high quality, no shedding and I created a look with them that was out of this world.  Yes, yes and YES.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend these brushes to anyone that wears makeup. They are a really good price and work really well and feel good and soft on your face. Better than the name brand ones i think that cost way more.</li>
    <li> Love love love these brushes!!!!  I have been looking for some good brushes for a wow and these are great my face never looked better.</li>
    <li> i have absolutely no complaints about these brushes. I bought these a few weeks ago and use them every day. there isn&#x27;t any shedding and they are easy to wash and dry and they haven&#x27;t loosened or come unglued from the process. would highly recommend</li>
    <li> I bought those brushes somewhere else but WOW!!! I never EVER expected brushes so amazing! The bristles are SOOOOO soft and gentle..I absolutely love EVERY single brush! I recently bought real techniques brushes as well and now I don&#x27;t have to buy ANY brushes for the longest time :)The handles are sturdy, don&#x27;t come off and overall I am very very impressed! Definitely highly recommended!</li>
    <li> These brushes are well made and super soft. I washed the brushes as soon as I received them and I did not notice any shedding. This is a good set of brushes to take along with you if you travel alot, they have a handy traveling case. I have purchased brush sets before and there would always be a few brushes within the kit that I would not use or had a purpose for, but with this brush set every brush will be used everytime I choose to wear makeup, which in my book is great value. I had been looking to buy a set of Sigma brushes for years, simply cannot afford to, however, now I want another set of these Easygoby brushes.</li>
    <li> Brushes shipped to me faster than expected, like a week or so earlier than the estimated delivery.&lt;br /&gt;They apply my makeup nice and smooth; There&#x27;s a little fallout with the bristles but not bad, pretty much like every brush.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend them to any makeup lover :)</li>
    <li> LOVZE these brushes. Really a nice set for the price. These would be great for a beginner, or if you never had nice brushes. These are great I really like them.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my daughter because the other ones that I got her at Target kept loosing the bristles - these so far a great and she really likes them -- lots of brushes for the money!!  don&#x27;t shed on her face.</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing. I use them often and there is no smell nor do the hair fall out. They are soft and easy to use, I love them.</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing! i ordered an additional set for home. A great set of brushes makes a BIG difference in the application of make up and the final product. What a great price. A complete full set, super soft, and came in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> When we received these brushes and opened the box there was such a foul odor it nearly knocked me over. We washed them with make-up brush cleaner before we could even consider giving them as a gift to our daughter. Even so they smell was still quite pungent. Too bad because the brushes are quite nice.</li>
    <li> LOOOOOVE THEM! They have lasted awhile now. Got these maybe a few months ago and so far no shedding!</li>
    <li> I first ordered a set of these for a Christmas gift for my oldest daughter,who absolutely loves them.I also love them,and of course needed a set for myself.They are high quality and very nice.The bristles are so soft.Both sets arrived earlier than had been predicted,packaged well,and in wonderful condition.We,my daughter and myself,ove this brush set.</li>
    <li> I like the brushes, but the bristles are falling out.  One of the powder brushes just had half of the bristles fall out and I had to throw it away</li>
