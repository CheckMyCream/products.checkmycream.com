      <li>I just used the product for the first time and I am very satisfied.</li>
      <li>i really love theease of use and applications,although i think i should have gotten the medium instead of the light brown for me.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
      <li>I ordered the light brow thinking it would fill my brows a bit more, they came out darker.</li>
      <li>Now I can just do them at home and its super easy!</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>easy to apply but still trying to figure out if I need to use conditioner after it dries.</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>It is very quick and easy and doesn&#x27;t stain your skin.</li>
      <li>Product works well and is easy to apply.</li>
      <li>This product is easy to use</li>
      <li>my eyebrows are dark brown and this color is perfect.</li>
      <li>The dye itself works fine &amp; covers well.</li>
      <li>CAUTION - the &amp;#34;light brown&amp;#34;....comes out BLACK-ish.........not &#x27;light brown&#x27; at all</li>
      <li>and i order light brown..</li>
      <li>So you may get a nice shadow-ey /filled in pencil effect that fades sooner than the hair dye or you may not get much of that &amp;#34;background&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>My eyebrows are light brown/blonde</li>
      <li>I got the light brown color.</li>
      <li>And such a great price</li>
      <li>Still, it&#x27;s a fair price compared to what I&#x27;d pay to have my brows done professionally.</li>
      <li>I have light brown hair &amp; very fair eyebrows that nearly disappear in the summer between natural sun bleaching and tanning.  </li>
      <li>; I was a natural redhead and my brows got real light; this product has out lasted my expectations</li>
      <li>They really bring out my eyebrows so much better than makeup could.</li>
      <li>Eyebrows do grow out, so the color&#x27;s endurance has a lot to do with how quickly your brows grow.</li>
      <li>Received the product quickly.  </li>
      <li>It comes out bold but when you do that it lasts longer .</li>
      <li>Made my very blonde eyebrows a nice shade of light brown.  </li>
      <li>VERY fast shipping!</li>
      <li>It is quick and easy to use, and it really works as it states.</li>
      <li>This kit actually surprised me with how easy it is to work with!</li>
      <li>The capsules are a bit of a pain to deal with and the rest of the reviewers are right in that you don&#x27;t need to use a full capsule.</li>
      <li>This stuff is so fast and easy.  </li>
      <li>Application is easy and the process is fast.  </li>
      <li>its looks way better then my clear and gray eyebrows and a touch of eye brow powder does the trick!</li>
      <li>It is a fantastic product and I highly recommend!</li>
      <li>Overall, the product is effective in keeping my brows colored for about 10 days, which is by far more convenient than using a pencil; therefore the 4 star rating.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a strawberry blonde and this color has matched up with me quite nicely.</li>
      <li>Useful product, would buy it again.</li>
      <li>Because the hair is dyed I think it looks more natural that using a crayon or powder to darken my brows.  </li>
      <li>However, a light touch up every other week maintains nicely.</li>
      <li>its way better than going to a salon because you are in complete control and can get the exact look you want.</li>
      <li>I find that 2 minutes is the perfect amount for the Light Brown kit, and doesn&#x27;t look too black or dark or anything.</li>
      <li>But I wish the light brow was an actual LIGHT BROWN.</li>
      <li>On people with black hair it might look good, but this is def not for people with  brown hair.</li>
      <li>I have very light blonde eyebrows and lashes.</li>
      <li>Lasts about two weeks on the actual hair as most brows will have fully regrown in 2-3 weeks.  </li>
      <li>This really works!  </li>
      <li>really love this on my blonde eyebrows!!</li>
      <li>With all that, this is unfortunately the best product I have come across.</li>
      <li>I usually reapply once a month, but I would say it&#x27;s fairly faded by week 3.</li>
      <li>now i just add a bit of definition with pencil whereas before i literally had to draw on my whole eyebrow and create the shape i wanted.</li>
      <li>how much pigment you need and</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>the whole process from start to finish literally takes 3 minutes.</li>
      <li>This product works very well foe me.  </li>
      <li>This has just made my life a whole lot easier.  </li>
      <li>Overall, very easy and big difference.</li>
      <li>Other then that I love the results</li>
      <li>(I do them one at a time to make sure I don&#x27;t over-process one while waiting on the other).</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> VERY fast shipping! I just used the product for the first time and I am very satisfied. I started out by leaving it on for only 30 seconds at a time just to see how it works, and I barely noticed a difference so I bumped up to a minute and did that twice on each brow! My eyebrows are still quite thin so I will need to fill them in but they are a perfect medium brown! Get this product if you have dark brown hair and want medium eyebrows, even though I am sure if you leave it on longer then your brows will be darker.</li>
    <li> My natural hair color is ashy brown, but I usually go a bit darker. My eyebrow color has lightened over the years (35 y/o) to where some brow hairs are blonde/clear (not gray...but like peach fuzz) making them look much thinner than they actually are. I hate penciling them in, because my brow inevitably itches, I absentmindedly scratch it, and then I end up with &amp;#34;brow&amp;#34; under my fingernails, and probably all over my face.&lt;br /&gt;So this stuff has been a life saver! I do 2 minutes per brow (I do them one at a time to make sure I don&#x27;t over-process one while waiting on the other). I find that 2 minutes is the perfect amount for the Light Brown kit, and doesn&#x27;t look too black or dark or anything. I usually reapply once a month, but I would say it&#x27;s fairly faded by week 3. Considering 1 capsule does both brows, and I only use it 1x per month, I think this is a good value.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use... I am getting better at applying.  The color is perfect for me.  The only thing is the capsules - a lot of waste.  Someone said they opened the capsules and put them in a container and use only as needed.  I will be doing that.</li>
    <li> This is the best home eyebrow kit that I have used! It is very quick and easy and doesn&#x27;t stain your skin. Great results!</li>
    <li> Received the product quickly.  I have used this before, but this time I opted for the larger size.  Ordered light brown, but it goes on dark, dark brown.  I am happy with it, however, as it covers all the gray in my eyebrows!</li>
    <li> It works,BUT! It&#x27;s very dark, be careful. On people with black hair it might look good, but this is def not for people with  brown hair. Find a lighter shade.</li>
    <li> I use this to dye my eyebrows and skin underneath. I leave it on for like 20-30 minutes so it has better stay power. It&#x27;s like I have semi-permanent eye brow makeup on so you wake up to perfect eyebrows every morning. This product will last a long time since you can use each pill 3-4 times. It is a fantastic product and I highly recommend! PS my eyebrows are dark brown and this color is perfect.</li>
    <li> It works ok. It gets really dark when you leave it in for awhile but I find myself repeating with this color.  I should have got brown. If your skin is oily it rubs off easy... which sucks</li>
    <li> works well; I was a natural redhead and my brows got real light; this product has out lasted my expectations</li>
    <li> I have salt and pepper eyebrows so they look sparse even though they are not.  I use this and it does the trick.  Glad I tried it.  05/29/2015</li>
    <li> Perfect for my ash brown/light brown eyebrows. Was a little darker than expected but there&#x27;s no red or blue tones to it so it looks natural still. Was a little bummed it didn&#x27;t dye my skin more underneath where I have very little hair from over plucking, but it dyed the hair very well.</li>
    <li> This really works!  My hair is blonde and my eyebrows are all but invisible.  Make-up is time consuming and wipes off, leaving a patchy mess so this product is definitely the answer.  Application is easy and the process is fast.  I suggest having your eyebrows professionally shaped prior to use, it is just easier to apply in the right place if you have a clearly defined path.</li>
    <li> I love this. It is quick and easy to use, and it really works as it states.</li>
    <li> I ordered the light brow thinking it would fill my brows a bit more, they came out darker. Looking almost black, and I have ash blonde hair :( ! Maybe i left it on for a few extra minutes, love the product because it stays. But I wish the light brow was an actual LIGHT BROWN.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Buy it all the time!</li>
    <li> Do one eyebrow at a time with this. And it tends to tint black if left on too long. I got the light brown color.</li>
    <li> Perfect for brows, easy to use, clean up a breeze, and it lasts forever.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these Godefroy Tint Kits for about a year.  I have very fair eye-brows, so a light-brown has always worked well.  Unfortunately this time the light-brown turned my brows to almost black and no, I did not leave it on for too long.  Overall, the product is effective in keeping my brows colored for about 10 days, which is by far more convenient than using a pencil; therefore the 4 star rating. I am wondering whether the wrong color was put in this box.</li>
    <li> Product works well and is easy to apply. I ordered light brown and it is darker than I expected, even when I wipe it off within a minute. But for the most part I am really pleased with it.</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot.  I have very light brown/blonde eyebrows and this make them more noticeable.  Because the hair is dyed I think it looks more natural that using a crayon or powder to darken my brows.  I did use another reviewers tip and do two applications of one minute each to avoid dying my skin.  Works great that way!  I do have to reapply every few weeks depending on how much I am out in the sun, washing my face, etc.</li>
    <li> This product works very well foe me.  I have medium blond hair and my own brows are beginning to show a lot of gray.  This product matches my hair after ablot two face washes.  The gray hairs stay covered for about two weeks.  I leave the product on for only 3 minutes, after reading reviews of other users.</li>
    <li> Great product. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> Came out dark brown and ashy nothing near light brown</li>
    <li> It definitely does what it claims, however the light brown is NOT light brown. I have very fair skin and my natural hair color is dark blonde, and this dyed my eyebrows very dark, it almost looks like a soft black color. I would give 5 stars if the color was what is says.</li>
    <li> It was what I had expected.</li>
    <li> Great product! I have very light eyebrows. I applied the tint for a minute, checked the color, and reapplied for another minute to achieve an ash brown that matches my natural hair perfectly. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Easy to use and great color. My eyebrows are light brown/blonde so I did have to leave the color on a little longer and reapply it several times. Color lasts about 2 weeks. The brush is good quality.</li>
    <li> This stuff is so fast and easy.  And such a great price</li>
    <li> The best product I&#x27;ve used to dye my very light and sparse eyebrows.  I wish the color capsules were easier to open.</li>
    <li> This eyebrow tint is the best. It comes out bold but when you do that it lasts longer .</li>
    <li> This product does work but NOT for 6 weeks as claimed. I have to use it weekly. The little capsules take a lot of patience to open without spilling all over.  Beware if you have white Corian counters. It stains and demands scouring or sanding to remove. With all that, this is unfortunately the best product I have come across.</li>
    <li> Fantastic! Really does what it says, is not really messy but be careful opening the capsules.  Comes with a brush and teeny mixing bowl so you won&#x27;t need any extras.  Be patient and reapply for 30 seconds - 1 minute intervals on each brow separately as others recommend.  Lasts about two weeks on the actual hair as most brows will have fully regrown in 2-3 weeks.  However, a light touch up every other week maintains nicely. I do add a bit of pencil still to fill in the areas that are more sparse but depending on your brow you may not need to.  Note it may or may not dye the skin &amp;#34;behind&amp;#34; the hair you are dying. So you may get a nice shadow-ey /filled in pencil effect that fades sooner than the hair dye or you may not get much of that &amp;#34;background&amp;#34; skin dye. Overall, very easy and big difference.</li>
    <li> not good it left my eye brow black and i order light brown..</li>
    <li> You really have to do what other reviewers say and not leave this tint on for longer than 15 seconds at a time. If you leave it on longer or do not wash it off well, it will continue to develop and your eyebrows will be dyed BLACK. Don&#x27;t ask me how I know! The great thing about this is that it&#x27;s so quick to work.  It&#x27;s just difficult to be as precise as you want within the 15 second time restraint! Also, follow the advice of others and use petroleum jelly around the brows in the places you do not want dye.</li>
    <li> The dye itself works fine &amp; covers well. However the &amp;#34;light brown&amp;#34; came out jet black on my eyebrows (pic included), after only leaving the dye in for 90 seconds (suggested time was 1-2 minutes). My natural color was an ashy blonde with some golden blonde in it. I have seen other reviews where blondes had similar experiences, so blondes be careful with this product!</li>
    <li> Always works well.  I test it as it sits to see it does not get too dark.  It does what it &amp;#34;says&amp;#34; it will do!</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot. I get about 3 uses out of each capsule. The only complaints I have is that doesn&#x27;t last as long as it says. I have to redo it almost every week, which isn&#x27;t terrible because I don&#x27;t mind having to do it. But The color defiantly is not light brown - it&#x27;s really just black but the longer you leave it the darker it gets... I suggest not leaving it on for as long as the instructions say, if it&#x27;s your first time. Other then that I love the results</li>
    <li> CAUTION - the &amp;#34;light brown&amp;#34;....comes out BLACK-ish.........not &#x27;light brown&#x27; at all</li>
    <li> really love this on my blonde eyebrows!! cuts down my make up time in the morning soo much - now i just add a bit of definition with pencil whereas before i literally had to draw on my whole eyebrow and create the shape i wanted. however you should note that it makes the hairs black, not brown as the package states. i didnt leave it on for long at all so i know it wasn&#x27;t because i left it on for longer than stated. i would suggest for a natural look that you only get it on the actual hairs and make sure that you don&#x27;t touch the skin below or it will dye the skin too (depends what look you are going for) its so so quick and simple to use. the whole process from start to finish literally takes 3 minutes. its way better than going to a salon because you are in complete control and can get the exact look you want. theres also soo much product, it will last you forever so definitely way cheaper than going to a salon</li>
    <li> I was nervous after reading some of the reviews.  I followed the directions on the package and my eyebrows turned out great.  Love the color.  Made my very blonde eyebrows a nice shade of light brown.  Easy to use.</li>
    <li> I use these every month. They really bring out my eyebrows so much better than makeup could. I hate wearing pencil on my eyebrow. I feel like you can see that it&#x27;s pencil. These are just perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Warning: Godefroy makes an awesome eyebrow dye, but never use their eyelash dye. It&#x27;s the WORST.</li>
    <li> This product is easy to use but I&#x27;ve noticed that it loses strength over time. Maybe the mixing liquid goes weak, or something. Whatever, after a month or two, I just have to throw away the remaining capsules because, no matter how long I leave the dye on, it just doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;take&amp;#34;. Still, it&#x27;s a fair price compared to what I&#x27;d pay to have my brows done professionally. It does stain anywhere it&#x27;s left, including fingernails. Eyebrows do grow out, so the color&#x27;s endurance has a lot to do with how quickly your brows grow. I wish it came in a pre-mixed tube, instead of in the messy way it comes now.</li>
    <li> This eyebrow tinting kit is phenomenal. I have extremely blonde eyebrows and was spending upwards of $40 a month getting them waxed and tinted at Benefit&#x27;s Brow Bar. Now I can just do them at home and its super easy! I got the light brown since my eyebrows are almost invisible and I think its a good color if you are a fellow blondie. I leave it on for a few seconds as advised but I reapply a few times until they are as dark as I want because I prefer darker brows. Definitely suggest this product to anyone looking to get fuller (or visible) brows!</li>
    <li> i really love theease of use and applications,although i think i should have gotten the medium instead of the light brown for me.&lt;br /&gt;But its looks way better then my clear and gray eyebrows and a touch of eye brow powder does the trick!</li>
    <li> This product did not work at all. I have tried it four times and it never worked. Big waste of money.</li>
    <li> This product works great. I have very light blonde eyebrows and lashes. It looks like I have no eyebrows without this product. Product works as stated and lasts up to four weeks.</li>
    <li> Actually 4 1/2 stars, as  the light brown is quite dark..but it should fade, and looks OK as is.  IT is SUPER-easy to use, and comes with a tiny mixing pot and application brush.  I have light brown hair &amp; very fair eyebrows that nearly disappear in the summer between natural sun bleaching and tanning.  This brings them back to life.  It does not dye your skin, only the hair.  Useful product, would buy it again.</li>
    <li> The capsules are a bit of a pain to deal with and the rest of the reviewers are right in that you don&#x27;t need to use a full capsule. I carefully opened one over the sink and only used maybe a third of the contents (still had leftover dye) and taped the other half of the capsule for later use. My only issue was that it dyed my eyebrows much darker than I wanted. I have dark blonde hair and having nearly black eyebrows looks a bit strange to me! Next time I will do one eyebrow at a time and quickly remove the dye after 30 seconds or so. If I want it darker, I&#x27;ll repeat. There&#x27;s plenty of dye after all...</li>
    <li> This kit actually surprised me with how easy it is to work with! I thought it would be complicated, messy...but it was none of that. Just read the directions. I like to use an eyebrow stencil so I get the shape I want, and it works! You just need to figure out on your own how much pigment you need and how long you leave it on. The nice thing is, if you make them too dark or a bad shape you&#x27;re not forever stuck with it. It fades within about a week, but even the next day they&#x27;re much less dark than when you first see it. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> easy to apply but still trying to figure out if I need to use conditioner after it dries. anyways, I used the conditioner after 15 minutes dry time.and my brows look natural. the light brown is dark enough for my brow.used it twice already. There&#x27;s more than enough for 3 times usage in one capsule if using for eyebrows only. If u have small container, it would be worth it to save the powder and really stretch the usage for this product.</li>
    <li> Tint last  a few weeks. I apply briefly a couple of times to be sure it isn&#x27;t too dark.  Beats applying brow color and gives a finished look even when wearing no other eye makeup.</li>
    <li> This stuff is a game changer.  It works just as described.  two minutes for my brows to be perfectly tinted medium brown, not messy, not difficult to use.  Foolproof.  I took another reveiwers advice and used a very thin paintbrush to put the dye on.  I also would recommend doing one brow at a time. the box will last a long time as well.</li>
    <li> I like the product but shipping took forever,  that&#x27;s why only 3 stars.</li>
    <li> product came in on time. Great product.</li>
    <li> This has just made my life a whole lot easier.  I love the fact that in the time it used to take me to put on a clear mascara and brown powder I can dye my brows, have it last for a week and a half and not have to worry about it flaking off during the day!  I&#x27;m a strawberry blonde and this color has matched up with me quite nicely.</li>
