      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>Love this stuff!</li>
      <li>I started using Thayers Alcohol-Free Rose Petal Witch Hazel Toner with Aloe Vera about a month ago, and I am sold.</li>
      <li>I will continue to use it though, because it smells good and refreshing after applying it to the skin.</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t tried the others besides the rose yet</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so nice</li>

      <li>Really, it&#x27;s just great.</li>
      <li>so refreshing on face and helps with bumps and redness.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love this toner and makes my skin look better without makeup ..</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m sure they won&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
      <li>I also really enjoy the rose scent (wish it would dissipate a bit faster though).</li>
      <li>Great product so far!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great way to get the sweat off if you are hot without washing your face and drying it out too much.</li>
      <li>Not too strong nor light.</li>
      <li>also really enjoy that fact that are no synthetic ingredients in this product.</li>
      <li>This is cooling and has a light rose scent which is not irritating or inflammatory to the skin.</li>
      <li>It smells great with a gentle rose scent, and gives your skin an extra clean feeling.</li>
      <li>I enjoy the rose fragrance that this particular toner has.</li>
      <li>This stuff really works like magic</li>
      <li>On a hot day, it is a great cool down!</li>
      <li>Also its so natural and safe sometimes I like to spray it on my face if I have makeup on just to get rid of that makeup</li>
      <li>This is my first Thayer&#x27;s purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It has a nice scent and helps her skin down there.</li>
      <li>I will certainly use this purchase again.</li>
      <li>Might be too gentle to really do a lot of work.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t see much difference in appearance, though.</li>
      <li>Non irritating, doesn&#x27;t over dry, and smells great!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve invested in expensive toners throughout my whole life, but I am so happy to come back to witch hazel because my skin has never been happier (as is my wallet!).</li>
      <li>I have sensitive and combination skin, and this seems to balance the oily areas and give light moisturization to dry areas, without breaking me out or making me red and itchy.</li>
      <li>This product was shipped in a box and wrapped with a clear plastic bag to contain spills during shipping.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had this toner for about a month now, I like it so far.</li>
      <li>My skin has developed a sort of glow since using this toner.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin that hates everything.</li>
      <li>Its gives you a decent amount of product in a big bottle.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only used for a couple weeks, and so far haven&#x27;t notice any difference yet as far as skin condition goes.</li>
      <li>gentle enough to use regularly.</li>

<li> The skin will feel pain, probably because my skin is very sensitive, I think is not very good!</li>
<li> Honestly, I am not one to be all girlie and focus on skin care.</li>
<li> but at times foundations or lipsticks have a weird smell.</li>
<li> I do notice that it helps heal breakouts a bit faster and doesn&#x27;t cause an annoying itch while sweating like my GA toner was doing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

    <li> Honestly, I am not one to be all girlie and focus on skin care. But this...totes heavenly liquid. I looove it! I have sensitive skin that hates everything. Tried this once and instantly saw a change in my skin. Softness, no redness, and any raised pores became flush. I will certainly use this purchase again. Quick shipping, fair price, great product!!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Non irritating, doesn&#x27;t over dry, and smells great! I&#x27;ll never use another toner. Haven&#x27;t tried the others besides the rose yet but I&#x27;m sure they won&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
    <li> Smells Lovely, excellent for your complexion; Witch Hazel clarifies, soothes, closes pores.</li>
    <li> I cant believe how good this is&lt;br /&gt;feels so refreshing on face and helps with bumps and redness.&lt;br /&gt;even my husband uses this too he also cant believe how this works on&lt;br /&gt;bug bites&lt;br /&gt;will be ordering again soon</li>
    <li> This is cooling and has a light rose scent which is not irritating or inflammatory to the skin. I use it on a cotton square after washing my face, twice a day. I have sensitive and combination skin, and this seems to balance the oily areas and give light moisturization to dry areas, without breaking me out or making me red and itchy. It&#x27;s a great way to get the sweat off if you are hot without washing your face and drying it out too much. It&#x27;s so nice I use it on my neck and upper chest too.</li>
    <li> This is really the best toner ever. I&#x27;ve invested in expensive toners throughout my whole life, but I am so happy to come back to witch hazel because my skin has never been happier (as is my wallet!). The rose water is a great addition and smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> I wish I had discovered this before. Its gives you a decent amount of product in a big bottle. I use it daily and it just tones and softens my skin instantly. You can actually feel it tightening your skin. This stuff really works like magic I&#x27;m not joking! I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to notice any scar fading though. I just need to give it more time. You can use it anyway you like, in masks, or put some in a spray bottle and spray some on your face whenever you have time and it will refresh you! It instantly wakes you up and it smells amazingggg!! Also its so natural and safe sometimes I like to spray it on my face if I have makeup on just to get rid of that makeup smell some products have! I don&#x27;t know how to explain it but at times foundations or lipsticks have a weird smell. This is perfect for it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this toner for about a month now, I like it so far. It feels very refreshing and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. I don&#x27;t see much difference in appearance, though.</li>
    <li> Love this toner and makes my skin look better without makeup .. Give it time to work</li>
    <li> Great for toning and cleansing your face! No alcohol that will dry out your skin.</li>
    <li> This is my first Thayer&#x27;s purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I have previously used a glycolic acid toner, however since starting to work out, sweat and glycolic acid just do not mix. I was looking for an alternative to help reduce clogged pores and keep my skin hydrated and bright. This seems to be doing its job. I also really enjoy the rose scent (wish it would dissipate a bit faster though). I do notice that it helps heal breakouts a bit faster and doesn&#x27;t cause an annoying itch while sweating like my GA toner was doing.&lt;br /&gt;I also really enjoy that fact that are no synthetic ingredients in this product.</li>
    <li> I started using Thayers Alcohol-Free Rose Petal Witch Hazel Toner with Aloe Vera about a month ago, and I am sold. It smells great with a gentle rose scent, and gives your skin an extra clean feeling. I wash my face, pat it dry, then apply the toner with a cotton ball. I let it dry for a minute, then apply my Vitamin C serum, let that dry, then my lotion. My face is softer, and my pores appear to be shrinking! My skin has developed a sort of glow since using this toner. I also use it in my underarms before applying deodorant, it seems to help keep me fresher. I love this product! Can I buy it by the gallon?</li>
    <li> The skin will feel pain, probably because my skin is very sensitive, I think is not very good!</li>
    <li> I love this. It&#x27;s wonderful on sensitive, smells excellent, isn&#x27;t drying. Really, it&#x27;s just great. Get some!</li>
    <li> gentle enough to use regularly. Might be too gentle to really do a lot of work.</li>
    <li> Great product so far!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve very sensitive skin but this toner doesn&#x27;t give me allergies. I&#x27;ve only used for a couple weeks, and so far haven&#x27;t notice any difference yet as far as skin condition goes. I will continue to use it though, because it smells good and refreshing after applying it to the skin.</li>
    <li> This product was shipped in a box and wrapped with a clear plastic bag to contain spills during shipping. It is also sealed so you would have to twist open the cap and remove the seal before using. I enjoy the rose fragrance that this particular toner has. Not too strong nor light. The scent actually goes away after about 10 mins. I bought it for our family to use after a shower and works as a great toner on our 12 month daughter.</li>
    <li> I like this witch hazel. I use it for my baby&#x27;s bum in a spray bottle. It has a nice scent and helps her skin down there.</li>
    <li> Smells really good. Has no alcohol, and is effective for itches, bruises, and swelling. On a hot day, it is a great cool down!</li>
