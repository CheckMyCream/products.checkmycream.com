### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>He said that Braun has one of the best names in the industry for quality buzzers.  </li>
      <li>Excellent hair clipper, doesn&#x27;t tug on hair and there is no pile of attachments to keep track of.  </li>
      <li>everything sounded awesome!</li>
      <li>the best to&lt;br /&gt;You and Yours!</li>
      <li>Also, the trimmer guard being attached is great!</li>
      <li>Oh, and the ergonomics are superb.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The best part is not needing to change the blades.</li>
      <li>So, I gave it to my barber and he was immediately impressed.  </li>
      <li>It is the perfect clipper.</li>
      <li>Both are cordless, which is great.  </li>
      <li>The Braun Cruzer 5 Clippers are great for beard trimming and shaping.</li>
      <li>These clippers are great for both of them and their needs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great for hair touch-ups</li>
      <li>But this thing is great.</li>
      <li>about everything else is great about this clipper.</li>
      <li>than that my hair cut looks great.</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>These clippers are great.  </li>
      <li>Works great.</li>
      <li>The adjustable clipper is a win in my book.</li>
      <li>Great for travel.</li>
      <li>It works great for the hair.</li>
      <li>Great for on-the-go trimming.  </li>
      <li>Great reviews, wireless, a good battery life...</li>
      <li>/&gt;First, the good things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is a good clipper.</li>
      <li>and if you knew Stan, my barber, you would know that he really loved it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>All in all a good inexpensive solution.</li>
      <li>The Braun Cruzer 5 is a good hair/beard trimmmer.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It does a good job of trimming hair on the head or on the body.  </li>
      <li>did a great job but make sure it is fully charged.</li>
      <li>I have been very pleased with the versatility of this trimmer.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, though, this does a really great job, even better and smoother shaving than the [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light but sturdy and I&#x27;m able to maneuver it around perfectly fine.&lt;br /&gt;-Options:</li>
      <li>I probably appreciate this feature even more than the cordless!  </li>
      <li>Still, an effective rechargeable clipper.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Making them cordless is also a really nice feature.  </li>
      <li>A charge station would be nice.</li>
      <li>but this hair clipper comes in handy for maintaining shorter hairstyles after visiting my</li>
      <li>Adjusting the length of the clipper could not be easier and the slide mechanic is really nice compared to changing attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Running it over my legs and arms was much easier, and everything was perfect.</li>
      <li>it is awesome, it really really works.</li>
      <li>It also has a great design and looks cool.</li>
      <li>it for a nice clean haircut and was pleasantly surprised.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Very easy to set the correct lengths on the guard.&lt;br /&gt;2.)</li>
      <li>This is a very easy to use clipper.  </li>
      <li>Would be nice if there was more adjustment or attachments to it.</li>
      <li>VERY smooth blade guard, cuts through my hair with ease without ever getting caught.&lt;br /&gt;3.)</li>
      <li>It charges quick, the settings seem to keep fairly well and are reliable (and I&#x27;m the paranoid type after having some trimming \\&quot;incidents\\&quot;).  </li>
      <li>The battery life is really good and it charges fairly quickly.</li>
      <li>I cut my own hair - I use a corded trimmer I bought ages ago - it&#x27;s easy to do because I have curly hair - no hairline.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think you could find a better product in this price range.  </li>
      <li>I love this clipper.</li>
      <li>Not having a cord in the way to trim up my neck is a bonus and the clippers are nice and smooth.  </li>
      <li>However, that someone is not me, so for my needs, the Wahl set suits better.</li>
      <li>That union should feel a bit more snug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, for keeping things trimmed or touching up here</li>
      <li>: I love this thing.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t recommend it more.</li>
      <li>I also have a Braun Cruzer 6 for the hair &amp; beard, but I think this one (Braun Cruzer 5 Hair Clipper 1 Count) is better for me.</li>
      <li>The sealed, washable models cost more than others.  </li>
      <li>many items in there</li>
      <li>The weight of the clippers feels good, it has a nice rubber casing, you can rinse the whole thing off.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m able to get a more finely tuned haircut and love the worflow of this tool.  </li>
      <li>It also comes with special combs for tapering and getting around the ears and has a nice case for everything.</li>
      <li>and there it&#x27;s actually pretty good.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The Cruzer 5 seems to be designed for a quick mens cut, maybe even for men to cut their own hair</li>
      <li>I found the clippers to not cut either hair as well as I wanted, but I seemed to have more difficulty with the fine hair.  </li>
      <li>comb/guard adjustment is super easy to move around and stays put well which makes adjustments on the fly very fast and easy.  </li>
      <li>It is light in weight, feels balanced in the hand, and has soft-touch plastic underneath for a sure grip.  </li>
      <li>and she was able to do it a lot faster being able to adjust the lengths quickly.</li>
      <li>In terms of use, it is really easy to use with just two controls 1:  on/off button, 2:  guard adjustment.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The integrated comb is easy to adjust and doesn&#x27;t get lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The guard just slides too easily.  </li>
      <li>every moment an everywhere you are able to create your own stye also thanks to its 12 possibility to lenght regulation..</li>
      <li>The ears are easy to do if I just tilt it.</li>
      <li>The motor in this model is distinctly more powerful than the one in my Cruzer 6, and while it does not have the variety of settings that the 6 has, it makes up for with a more robust motor.</li>
      <li>the adjustable head piece BREAKS EASILY.</li>
      <li>The power cord comes out a bit easily.  </li>
      <li>Using them is easy and if you are looking to trim this is probably your product.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s easy to shake it out.  </li>
      <li>I have a Norelco that&#x27;s been going strong for over a year but doesn&#x27;t shave close</li>
      <li>You can easily start at a longer level of clipping and gradually slide to a closer cut without having to stop and switch attachments which lends to the smooth and speedy method I need.  </li>
      <li>Important features include the rechargeable battery, the comfortable handgrip, and the easily adjustable length settings.  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re super easy to clean, I love that you can run them under water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I find that it&#x27;s very important and have good luck following manufacturers recommendations with cordless products.&lt;br</li>
      <li>He liked it so much, he gave me a free hair cut</li>
      <li>lack of a charging stand and a travel case are the primary seasons why this is 4 stars rather than 5.  </li>
      <li>(I believe this is the link of the one I own now; if not, it&#x27;s very close).&lt;br</li>
      <li>The Braun Cruzer 5 Hair Clipper has a thoughtful design.  </li>
      <li>again--great for travel and light work.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The item is comfortable and light to hold.  </li>
      <li>Having owned many powered clippers, sometimes they are still usable after the battery&#x27;s useful life is up, but sometimes they are not, and in either case you might as well have gotten a wall-powered unit.</li>
      <li>After a few cycles of charging this way it gives you the best life for your battery charges.  </li>
      <li>This meant I wasn&#x27;t able to get quite as close as I would like right around the ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>But once I turned it on after a full charge, I could tell just by holding it that this wasn&#x27;t going to be an easy battle against my hair.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It can be rinsed under the faucet which is very handy since clippers pick up debris, especially in crevices.  </li>
      <li>It cuts accurately and cleanly.  </li>
      <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
      <li>but it did not demonstrate any significant drain.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The product sucks. I&#x27;ve had 2, first one went out on me so I got a second one delivered to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades tug and pull at your hair and it is incredibly ANNOYING and PAINFUL. This thing may WORK FOR A BABY that has PEACH FUZZ. But if YOU are a REAL MAN this thing won&#x27;t be able to cut your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the adjustable head piece BREAKS EASILY. Luckily I had a spare from having the original go out on me.</li>
    <li> So, I like my hair to be shaved at the 6mm length, and so this new Braun Cruzer looked like it would do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it does!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the good things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.) Very easy to set the correct lengths on the guard.&lt;br /&gt;2.) VERY smooth blade guard, cuts through my hair with ease without ever getting caught.&lt;br /&gt;3.) Has oodles of power, and never feels like it&#x27;s struggling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now, the bad things...:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.) The adjustment for the guard is in a really odd place, right where you&#x27;d expect the power button to be. My wife is extremely worried that she&#x27;ll press it and adjust the guard length by mistake. To be fair, the only directly you&#x27;re likely to press is UP (which lengthens the guard - not a terrible thing), but still... we think the guard adjustment button should be on the side of the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.) Absolutely no attachments or case included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, though, this does a really great job, even better and smoother shaving than the [[ASIN:B00ARF429S Philips Norelco QG3380/42 Multigroom Pro]] that I had been using till now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars out of 5!</li>
    <li> I love this clipper. It is the perfect clipper. I threw my very expensive set out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun Cruzer slides right through my boys coarse curly hair without yanking. My son didn&#x27;t believe it would since he always gets his hair pulled. But this thing is great. The charge lasts long enough cut one head of hair. If I were quicker I could probably do both of my sons but I am slow. It is so nice to be able to do this outside. I like being able to let the birds (we live in the country) pick up the hair to build nests rather than cleaning it up in my kitchen. (yes, I let my boys hair get  that long I used to really hate cutting it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part is not needing to change the blades. There is nothing to keep track of. The ears are easy to do if I just tilt it. This is way better than my previous system and I am sticking with it.</li>
    <li> The Braun Cruzer worked well for us!  Important features include the rechargeable battery, the comfortable handgrip, and the easily adjustable length settings.  The clipper cuts well, with absolutely no problems.  My husband has been cutting my son&#x27;s short hair for years and has gone through many different styles of clippers.  He reports that this unit will be his clipper of choice for the foreseeable future.  His only concern was that since the adjustment button is so prominent, he could possibly adjust the lengths by accident.  A minor point of concern for what was ultimately a fine product and at the current pricing, an excellent value.</li>
    <li> Great product. It does exactly what I wanted, cut my hair evenly, less mess, easy to carry and light.</li>
    <li> February 2015 update:&lt;br /&gt; The hair clipper is no longer holding a charge and won&#x27;t work when plugged in either. Not sure that the product is worth the money if it only lasts under 2 years.&lt;br /&gt;It did hold well under monthly use (twice a month) and used wet or dry and the blades kept sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review.&lt;br /&gt;Use it for a nice clean haircut and was pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;It does have a couple of power issues here and there when the hair is too thick (think overgrown) but besides that it worked flawlessly.&lt;br /&gt;The integrated length control piece works well but didn&#x27;t translate easier to a regular clipper measurements.&lt;br /&gt;This one goes from 0 mm and in increments of 3 mm up to 24 mm....so a 1/2 in should be around 12 mm.&lt;br /&gt;I cut my hair a little shorter because of this but it was swift and clean at cutting.&lt;br /&gt;It did a great job but make sure it is fully charged. Mine wasn&#x27;t and its power decreased after 15 min.&lt;br /&gt;Also because of the plastic attachment sometimes the hair (if a little long) can get caught up there, just need to shake it off or brush it off.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that my hair cut looks great. Definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> The Braun Cruzer 5 Hair Clipper is a good, rechargeable hair clipper with a cleverly designed removable guard for different lengths.  4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most reviews of this product along with the manufacturer&#x27;s description seem to miss that this is basically just a solid 1 1/2\\&quot; trimmer with a removable guard.  As such, it&#x27;s perfectly fine for trimming sideburns or such with the guard off.  It&#x27;s just about the right weight for a clipper - lighter clippers are a bit hard to go through thick hair - with the only real drawback being that as a rechargeable it&#x27;s definitely not as powerful as comparable [[ASIN:B001JJBC9Y Oster]] or [[ASIN:B000I1S18Y Wahl]] corded models.  If you&#x27;re going to be doing a lot of hair cutting, it&#x27;s worth spending the extra $20 or so for a plug in model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one really neat feature of this is the removable guard.  It offers 8 settings of 3 mm increments between 3 mm and 24 mm with a single attachment, which is certainly unique.  It&#x27;s a little disappointing that standard barber shop clipper blade guard sizes aren&#x27;t marked off as well - there certainly is room for them on one side of the guard - but since they both vary by clipper brand and are measured in inches rather than millimeters it&#x27;s understandable why Braun didn&#x27;t do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lack of a charging stand and a travel case are the primary seasons why this is 4 stars rather than 5.  Something lightweight like this begs for being put in a travel bag as a slightly less powerful but still very effective clipper when you&#x27;re on the road, but sadly Braun didn&#x27;t include one.  Still, an effective rechargeable clipper.  4 stars.</li>
    <li> The Braun Cruzer 5 is a good hair/beard trimmmer. It has adjustable settings to maintain an extra close beard. I&#x27;ve maintained a mid-length goatee for the past 25 years and the Braun Cruzer does an admirable job maintaining my look. However, in terms of quality and overall cut, the Panasonic Milano ER-GB40 blows this machine out of the water. The Panasonic gets all of those stray/awkwardly angled hairs whereas the Braun is merely run of the mill in this category. I did not use this product as a hair trimmer since I&#x27;m bald and shave my head with a straight razor. Overall, this is a good beard trimmer but I would recommend spending the extra $20 for the Panasonic.</li>
    <li> Well designed, easy to hold and powerful. The adjustable clipper is a win in my book. It easily adjusts its length by sliding the attachment up and down with your thumb. My mom cut my son&#x27;s hair with this and she was able to do it a lot faster being able to adjust the lengths quickly. You can clean it off by putting it under a faucet. Other than that my husband uses it to shave his head and it works great for that too. I would recommend this to others</li>
    <li> This particular clipper includes a blade-guide for cutting hair at different lengths. Besides that, the cutting blades are nice and sharp, doing the work in one pass, getting it right the first time. Oh, and the ergonomics are superb. A pleasure to hold as you cut hair. I wish the blades were sharper like WAHL&#x27;s blades.</li>
    <li> Any time I get new clippers, I&#x27;m excited to see if I&#x27;ve finally found something to replace my ancient Wahl Chrome that shouldn&#x27;t even still be working considering the shape it&#x27;s in. I&#x27;ve gotten a few different ones over the last couple of months, and they all disappointed me almost immediately. I&#x27;ll tell you right now that my review may not be that fair, considering that I only use clippers to shave my head and occasionally my arms and legs. I don&#x27;t do any styling, and when it comes to thinning my beard, I just go over it with a razor a couple of times to make it look better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping the Braun Cruzer 5 here would be my new go-to device for shaving my head. Great reviews, wireless, a good battery life...everything sounded awesome! But once I turned it on after a full charge, I could tell just by holding it that this wasn&#x27;t going to be an easy battle against my hair. I have very thick, coarse hair. Even shaving my head with strong wired clippers takes at least 10 minutes to get everything evened out just right. The Cruzer felt weak and the wimpy sound it was making didn&#x27;t get me any more hyped to use it. I usually wait 8-10 days between head shaves...and running this thing over my head felt like I had waited a month or two! I had to really press in order to make progress. After a couple of lines, I&#x27;d given up. This poor thing wasn&#x27;t going to cut it (literally and figuratively). At first I was wondering if I had the length setting too high up. Nope! It was down as short as you can set it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Running it over my legs and arms was much easier, and everything was perfect. There wasn&#x27;t any overheating or other problems that occurred while using it. Using it for your beard or mustache will be simple too, and it&#x27;s nice to not have a cord dangling around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have thin hair and shave your head, or do your own trimming, then this product should satisfy you. But if you&#x27;re like me, stick with whatever you&#x27;ve been using.</li>
    <li> Economir hair cutter for an home made and &amp;#34;do-it-yourself&amp;#34; style.&lt;br /&gt;in every moment an everywhere you are able to create your own stye also thanks to its 12 possibility to lenght regulation..and, if the battery is low, do not worry, take the charger and continue!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With its ergonomic handle you have the total control of grip even in difficult areas, such as behind the ears.&lt;br /&gt;In the kit you receive a little brush to clean the blades from the hair residues and a oil lubrificant for the total maintenance of your hair cutter.</li>
    <li> it is awesome, it really really works. I can&#x27;t recommend it more.</li>
    <li> Works great. Would be nice if there was more adjustment or attachments to it. If you want very short to very ,very short hair. It works terrific.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using various brands of clippers for &gt;15 years.  This is a very easy to use clipper.  It&#x27;s very compact, light, and waterproof! The clipper width is not particularly wide, comparable to other compact clipper sets from Norelco and Remington.  In terms of use, it is really easy to use with just two controls 1:  on/off button, 2:  guard adjustment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The comb/guard adjustment is super easy to move around and stays put well which makes adjustments on the fly very fast and easy.  However, the max length of the guard is only 3-24 mm, and it&#x27;s not marked with barber numbers (like #3), only mm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it on two boys&#x27; heads, one with thin fine hair, the other thick normal hair.  I found the clippers to not cut either hair as well as I wanted, but I seemed to have more difficulty with the fine hair.  It would take multiple swipes to cut the hair.  Ultimately, I think the clippers might be underpowered with less RPM or maybe the blades just aren&#x27;t sharp enough to really do fine hair well.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t review this product myself--instead, I gave it my barber to evaluate (a little bit of a cheat but, you&#x27;ll find out why soon...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I receive this clipper, I realized it wasn&#x27;t for me--it was really designed for people with beards and those who are African-American.  So, I gave it to my barber and he was immediately impressed.  He said that Braun has one of the best names in the industry for quality buzzers.  He liked it so much, he gave me a free hair cut and if you knew Stan, my barber, you would know that he really loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went and stopped by his little shop a week later and he thanked me for the clipper.  He said that he used it a number of times on his clients and he even had his business partner use it on him as well (he&#x27;s black and really likes fades).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stan (and myself) will definitely recommend this to barbers, people with African-American type hair, and those who have beards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review has helped you.  If so, please click the &#x27;yes&#x27; button below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the best to&lt;br /&gt;You and Yours!</li>
    <li> When this shaver worked it worked very well. Got a close trim with my scruff and left just the right amount on. I had this trimmer for 3 months and it&#x27;s now DEAD!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plug it in, it doesn&#x27;t charge, it doesn&#x27;t do anything. It&#x27;s just dead. I have a Norelco that&#x27;s been going strong for over a year but doesn&#x27;t shave close enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want this one again but I don&#x27;t feel I should have to pay for another one seeing I only had it for 3 months.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a good beard/mustache trimmer, or other light hair grooming and finer styling work, then the Cruzer 5 is a fine way to go. The design is sleek and I like that it&#x27;s lightweight and compact. Great for travel. It&#x27;s washable and the adjustable length guide is better constructed than the old Norelco that I used for years and many other such units.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I would not recommend this as an all-purpose hair clipper. Unless you have very short hair (like a buzz cut or a crew cut), I don&#x27;t think it will suffice. The length settings are limited (only 8 settings from 3 mm to 24 mm) and while the length guide is better made than some other models, it&#x27;s still a little flimsy for heavy use. I would be wary of expecting this to last or perform well if you ask a lot from it. I also would never recommend a battery-powered unit for that task, unless you really need the portability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery life is very good, to be fair, (manufacturer claims 40 mins, but honestly I haven&#x27;t tested that), more than enough for trimming and touch up work, but might not be enough to cut hair, especially if you&#x27;re thinking of doing more than one person back to back. You can plug the unit in and use wall power to get around the battery life altogether, but I think the battery is in-line, meaning that when plugged in it is still running off battery power. This means that when (not if) the battery dies, you will have problems. Having owned many powered clippers, sometimes they are still usable after the battery&#x27;s useful life is up, but sometimes they are not, and in either case you might as well have gotten a wall-powered unit. But, this depends on how you intend to use these... again--great for travel and light work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price point is not bad, but not great. Ultimately, you are paying for the name and for the marketing, and for the battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are a good choice is you are looking for a battery-powered unit, or something easy to travel with, or if you only have light work or beard/mustache trimming and personal grooming in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to cut your own or someone else&#x27;s hair, have heavier duty work in mind, don&#x27;t need to travel or want something compact, or if you just want better CLIPPERS for less money, I would recommend looking at cord-powered clipper units made by Wahl. With no batteries to do and with much heavier duty motors and clippers, they are a better buy. In particular, the Wahl 79300 series has 20 different length color-coded guide combs (more than double the length options), not a single adjustable guide that might break, and is much better constructed and more powerful for half the price. It also comes with special combs for tapering and getting around the ears and has a nice case for everything.</li>
    <li> I like the idea of having a cordless clipper, but the hair guide is not very sturdy. I hold it with my hand to keep it from moving. After about 3 months the battery started to give me problems so I trashed it.</li>
    <li> This Braun cruZer Hair Clipper is intended for guys who like to keep their hair short on a constant basis.  I like to vary my hair lengths for refreshing, new looks but this hair clipper comes in handy for maintaining shorter hairstyles after visiting my barber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Likes:&lt;br /&gt;&gt;Rechargeable but may be used with a cord when the charge is low.&lt;br /&gt;&gt;Charge indicator turns off when trimmer is fully charged.&lt;br /&gt;&gt;Average sized but lightweight clipper.  Great for hair touch-ups while on-the-go.&lt;br /&gt;&gt;Eight adjustable hair trimmer comb settings for 3-24mm lengths.&lt;br /&gt;&gt;Waterproof: fully washable but don&#x27;t submerge the clipper especially with the power cord plugged in!&lt;br /&gt;&gt;Comes with power/recharge cord, small brush for cleaning the clipper head,  and a small bottle of  oil to lube the cutting system inside (shown in manual diagrams).&lt;br /&gt;&gt;Up to 40 minutes of cordless trimming (I&#x27;m usually finished trimming by 30 minutes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Concerns:&lt;br /&gt;&gt;No portable stand included.&lt;br /&gt;&gt;No carrying case included.&lt;br /&gt;&gt;Wider trimmer head (without the comb) allows general trimming of larger areas but requires more skill/effort for fine details like around the edges, ears, sideburns, beards, or mustaches.&lt;br /&gt;&gt;Results highly dependent upon user skills unless user is just going for an overall shortly trimmed hairstyle as shown on the box.&lt;br /&gt;&gt;Have to remember to fully discharge the batteries every six months to maintain optimal battery capacity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;Nice, sharp clipper for trimming larger areas of hair but intended for shorter hairstyles.  Great for on-the-go trimming.  I use my [[ASIN:B0062IWQVU Gillette Fusion Proglide 3-In-1 Styler]] for around the edges, sideburns, mustaches, etc.  To prevent any unfortunate hairstyle malfunctions, I still prefer my long term barber.</li>
    <li> I cut my own hair - I use a corded trimmer I bought ages ago - it&#x27;s easy to do because I have curly hair - no hairline.  My current trimmer works OK, but doesn&#x27;t have many options for hair-length, and that cord drives me nuts.&lt;br /&gt;This thing was a godsend.  I didn&#x27;t realize how much that cord slowed me down when cutting my hair until I got this thing.&lt;br /&gt;-Speed:  I&#x27;m able to cut my hair in less time (and more accurately) because this is a cordless device.  It&#x27;s light but sturdy and I&#x27;m able to maneuver it around perfectly fine.&lt;br /&gt;-Options: The ability to change the length of the cut is very fine tuned; you&#x27;re able to make it just a little longer or shorter with a quick click on the slider thingy.  I don&#x27;t know about the numbers on the side - I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re referring to milimeters or centimeters or what.  It should be in inches like 1.25 inches, .30 inches - something to give me some reference.  This is America - we don&#x27;t use no metric system here!!!&lt;br /&gt;-Workability:  It cuts just fine: doesn&#x27;t really get clogged up with hair and it&#x27;s easy to shake it out.  It cuts accurately and cleanly.  It took me maybe 20 minutes to cut my hair and the charge lasted the whole time with no decrease in power.&lt;br /&gt;-Overall: I love this thing.  I&#x27;m able to get a more finely tuned haircut and love the worflow of this tool.  It just works really, really well.  I&#x27;m psyched to have it!!!</li>
    <li> I use this to trim my goatee/mustache as well as the side and back of my haircut.  For maintaining a short cut, it works pretty well.  I like that it is rechargeable and requires no cord connection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What would I change?  I wish it was a lithium battery (vs. NiMH) - I garnered from reading online about it you should discharge before recharging.  The trimming is a bit inaccurate.  I find if I use it weekly, some of the hairs clipped are much longer in week 2, suggesting it missed them the previous week.  If you are using it for relatively short cuts, and using it regularly, it seems to work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using another hair clipper to trim my husband&#x27;s hair (we just buzz cut it in the summer), and it was quite different from this one. This one definitely has an advantage over the old one. My favorite feature of this product is the rechargeable battery - I don&#x27;t have to constantly turn him around to make sure I&#x27;m not strangling him with the cord. Also, the trimmer guard being attached is great! I&#x27;m not fiddling with different sizes, and always losing the one I need! I would definitely recommend this trimmer!</li>
    <li> Though the Braun Curzer is a decent set of clippers, I prefer the Conair, shown below.  Both are cordless, which is great.  I used corded clippers for years, and never again.  Cordless is SO much easier.  It could just be me, but I prefer to swap the combs so I know exactly what I&#x27;m doing.  I must admit that I like the fact you can use the Braun while your hair is wet, and you can also rinse it under water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B007PN22NI Conair HC1100AM I-Pro Professional Super Clipper, Lithium]]</li>
    <li> This is a good clipper. It&#x27;s sturdy, holds a long charge, and can easily clip beards and sideburns. The unit adjusts to many different lengths with no attachment to lose. The down side is that if you are trimming longer hair on the top of your head the unit does not work very well. We tried shaving my sons hair at a medium length and it did not work. For all else aside from long hair it works fine. pretty much for beards and facial hair. It also has a great design and looks cool. A charge station would be nice. Something like my toothbrush has.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve cut my husband&#x27;s hair for the past five or so years, so I&#x27;ve had a chance to experiment with everything from office scissors to home hair cutting kits. Prior to the Braun system, I had only used versions of the [[ASIN:B000JNQSIQ Wahl 79300-400 Color Pro 20 Piece Complete Haircutting Kit]] (I believe this is the link of the one I own now; if not, it&#x27;s very close).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an extremely compact system, with battery (as well as regular cord plug-in) capabilities, which would make it extremely useful for travel. The design is very young and appealing, and the design is very user-friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the measurements on the side of the device (perhaps because it&#x27;s a German company?) are not in inches, and the single length adjustment piece means that there are no tailored \\&quot;behind-the-ear\\&quot; pieces (like the Wahl). This meant I wasn&#x27;t able to get quite as close as I would like right around the ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The single blue plastic length adjustment piece also made it more difficult to consistently trim the slightly longer lengths -- the gap between the trimming piece and the plastic adjuster made it so that a lot of hair got pushed to the side rather than combed through the adjuster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this particular set of clippers would be ideal for someone who is looking for a lightweight, simple, stylish set of clippers, and particularly someone who likes a quite short all-over cut (which would avoid the pushed-over hair issue). However, that someone is not me, so for my needs, the Wahl set suits better.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like the Cruzer 5, but it&#x27;s got one major flaw... I&#x27;ll cut to the chase.  The length selector!  You slide the guards up or down to change sizes from 3mm to 25mm.  The guard just slides too easily.  It needs to ratchet in to place, or click, or snap.  Even a small amount of resistance at each size is necessary.  If you&#x27;re &#x27;pushing&#x27; and wanting a longer length, the guard just slides all the way down to 3mm.  Every time.  Either you&#x27;ll have super uneven cuts, or you&#x27;ll be obsessively checking to make sure its on the right depth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cruzer 5 seems to be designed for a quick mens cut, maybe even for men to cut their own hair (I did not try this).  The weight of the clippers feels good, it has a nice rubber casing, you can rinse the whole thing off.  The power button is located low on the handle and is flush with the casing, so it&#x27;s hard to accidentally turn it on or off.  The power cord comes out a bit easily.  That union should feel a bit more snug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless you like your hair 3mm or with a bare guard, I&#x27;d pass on this one.  Also, I clipped the tops of my ears and as its built for coarser hair, the blade guard feels very rough against soft hair.  Just not for me...</li>
    <li> The Braun Cruzer 5 Hair Clipper has a thoughtful design.  It is light in weight, feels balanced in the hand, and has soft-touch plastic underneath for a sure grip.  The integrated comb is easy to adjust and doesn&#x27;t get lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does a good job of trimming hair on the head or on the body.  The comb is hard plastic but seems sturdy enough and the cut is even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can be rinsed under the faucet which is very handy since clippers pick up debris, especially in crevices.  The sealed, washable models cost more than others.  I recommend using an old toothbrush rather than the little cleaning brush that is included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is an intermittent flashing indicator on the power button when charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design is attractive and streamlined and the blue accents on the black body are very modern and masculine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The motor is quite a bit louder and higher-pitched than the other clippers I have tested and the teeth are larger so it doesn&#x27;t work so well without the comb for close clipping.  The range is 3 to 24 mm in 3 mm increments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the Braun Cruzer 5 Hair Clipper is a good choice for trimming the hair on the head or body unless a length of less than 3 mm is desired.</li>
    <li> It works great for the hair. I also have a Braun Cruzer 6 for the hair &amp; beard, but I think this one (Braun Cruzer 5 Hair Clipper 1 Count) is better for me.</li>
    <li> Braun&#x27;s Cruzer 5 Hair Clipper is a neat item in that it aims to bring a handheld clipper with wireless convenience.  The item is comfortable and light to hold.  It&#x27;s much smaller than a traditional plug in clipper as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Performance?  In terms of trimming directly with the metal clipper, the performance seems solid.  It trims beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, should you add on the easily adjustable comb and attempt to actually cut hair, it&#x27;s a more interesting situation.  The relative light weight and size of the clipper causes it to not quite grasp the hair.  Therefore, you end up making many more passes than you would with a traditional hard wired clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you&#x27;re mainly using this for direct trimming around tough to reach spaces, it&#x27;s a neat product as it&#x27;s wireless.  However, for more heavy duty hair cutting, you might look at a traditional product.</li>
    <li> I like it.&lt;br /&gt;Not many items in there but contains all I need.&lt;br /&gt;Simple, and quiet. It&#x27;s really what I want. It needs to be stronger and sharper</li>
    <li> There are a lot of things to like about the Braun Cruzer 5.  Sleek looking package, cordless operation, decent battery life, name brand manufacturer to name a few.  However as others have noted and I myself experienced, there is one very poorly thought out design flaw that detracts from the Braun.  The guards do not lock into place and it&#x27;s all too easy to cut off more hair than expected, even if another person is doing the cutting for you.  Who wants an uneven cut?  It should be a very simple fix for Braun, but until they address it, pass on this model.</li>
    <li> good for my short hair.Work well</li>
    <li> This review may help you decide between a cordless, washable hair clipper (the Braun) vs. a traditional, home use corded clipper with length attachments.  My husband also owns a common Wahl clipper with numerous extensions.  For cutting lengths, the Braun is in Metric Units and the Wahl extensions are in English Units.  Both clippers can do the job, but the Braun is all he needs with his busy lifestyle.  His hair is thick, and can get curly when it grows out too long (over 1 1/2\\&quot;), so he does his best cutting it at 3/4\\&quot; at the longest.  Here is the breakdown on hair cutting lengths of the Braun (nearest English equivalent) and the attachments for Wahl that he owns:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wahl  Braun&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1/16\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1/8\\&quot;  vs  3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3/16\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1/4\\&quot;  vs  6&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3/8\\&quot;  vs  9&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1/2\\&quot;  vs  12&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5/8\\&quot;  vs  15&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3/4\\&quot;  vs  18&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7/8\\&quot;  vs  21&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1\\&quot;  vs  24&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 1/4\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 1/2\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He rarely used the two longest Wahl extensions when he got them, and he never uses them now.  The long extensions vibrate, chatter, and are more difficult to cut hair evenly; so he gave up.  Both Braun and Wahl are equally powerful enough to cut thick hair; no stopping or pulling.  Both can be used at any time; if the Braun battery is dead, you can still plug it into the wall and use it.  I would not recommend either Braun or Wahl models to cut other body hair (ex pubic hair) as he has used both for this use and has easily cut sensitive skin to blood.  Braun has a Body Shaver model for this use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wahl Advantages&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fading --- the Wahl holds the advantage in fading transitions at short lengths as the 1/16\\&quot; and 3/16\\&quot;  have end up being very useful to make fading easier (and look better) around ears.  The Wahl also comes with two fading extensions (fade left, fade right) didn&#x27;t include in the list above, but he doesn&#x27;t care for the fading lengths it provides (short side not short enough) so he never usesthem.  Now he can get nearly as good with the Braun, but after a few days of hair growth, he can&#x27;t tell the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price --- on average, and barring special deals, a standard Wahl will be cheaper up front, and cheaper to replace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun Advantages&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleanup --- the Braun&#x27;s blue guide is removable, and hard-to-remove hair clippings can be rinsed off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ease-of-use --- the Braun&#x27;s cordless feature wins over dancing around a cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Storage --- the Braun&#x27;s integrated blue length guide beats 12+ extensions that he has to sift through, read, detach old, attach new.</li>
    <li> The Braun Cruzer 5 Clippers are great for beard trimming and shaping. Using them is easy and if you are looking to trim this is probably your product. That being said, I wish they could get a little bit closer, especially when it comes to cleaning up facial hair. The picture on the box is a bit deceiving about how short they can trim, and I commonly find myself bringing out a razor to do some final clean up after using these clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just about everything else is great about this clipper. The battery life is really good and it charges fairly quickly. Adjusting the length of the clipper could not be easier and the slide mechanic is really nice compared to changing attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this clipper can do a lot, but just falls a bit short when it comes to getting that really close shave that I want in some cases.</li>
    <li> I have used Braun products for almost two decades and this product holds up to the quality expected of the Braun name.  Not having a cord in the way to trim up my neck is a bonus and the clippers are nice and smooth.  No pulling hair here!  All in all a good inexpensive solution.</li>
    <li> Excellent hair clipper, doesn&#x27;t tug on hair and there is no pile of attachments to keep track of.  When it arrives just plug it in to charge the green light comes on when it needs charging and goes off when it is fully charged.  I left mine plugged in overnight for the first charge.  It holds for 40 mins of clipping time when used cordless.  They recommend that you allow the charge to fully run out before you charge again.  After a few cycles of charging this way it gives you the best life for your battery charges.  People don&#x27;t always pay attention to those recommendations but I find that it&#x27;s very important and have good luck following manufacturers recommendations with cordless products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clipping attachment has a slide lever on the back of the unit and measurement levels marked on the side, this eliminates the need for separate attachments and it&#x27;s very handy.  I probably appreciate this feature even more than the cordless!  The single attachment does pop off simply for cleaning or to use the clipper without it but it won&#x27;t fall off while you are cutting.  Perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son usually struggles to sit through a summer buzz cut but not with this product.  It was quick and painless (no tugging or  getting stuck in longer hair.) You can easily start at a longer level of clipping and gradually slide to a closer cut without having to stop and switch attachments which lends to the smooth and speedy method I need.  I highly recommend.  I have used probably 10 different sets of clippers over the years of doing home haircuts and this is by far my favorite.</li>
    <li> I have been very pleased with the versatility of this trimmer. The shortest trim length is 3 mm which  is perfectly adequate for most trim jobs, leaving nothing more than a thick stubble. The motor in this model is distinctly more powerful than the one in my Cruzer 6, and while it does not have the variety of settings that the 6 has, it makes up for with a more robust motor. With the 6, thick body/head hair would take 2-3 passes, whereas one is usually sufficient with this model. The blade guard has been reinforced for this model compared to my other Cruzer. Battery life seems solid, I haven&#x27;t pushed it much further than 30 mins of shave time or so but it did not demonstrate any significant drain.</li>
    <li> These clippers are great.  My husband uses them for his hair, and his facial hair all the time, and I use them on my son.  He likes to keep his hair pretty short too, like his father, but in varying styles.  These clippers are great for both of them and their needs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with different attachments, so you can customize your look.  They&#x27;re super easy to clean, I love that you can run them under water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Making them cordless is also a really nice feature.  I have other clippers I&#x27;ve used in the past, and the cord always gets in the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a really excellent product, and a great price.  I don&#x27;t think you could find a better product in this price range.  My whole family would highly recommend them!</li>
    <li> The most important thing to note about this trimmer is that it doesn&#x27;t really hold up to heavy duty use.  The battery life is pretty decent but the motor and the blades just can&#x27;t hack through 60 days of beard growth as well as some other wireless products have been able to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, for keeping things trimmed or touching up here and there it&#x27;s actually pretty good. The head is a bit wide for really fine detail work but it just takes a tad more care to get things how you like it.  It charges quick, the settings seem to keep fairly well and are reliable (and I&#x27;m the paranoid type after having some trimming \\&quot;incidents\\&quot;).  I really appreciate that it&#x27;s sealed so it&#x27;s washable, I&#x27;ve poured plenty of water over this thing with no hiccups which makes it very easy to keep clean, no little nibbles of stubble in every nook and cranny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually have a terrible habit of forgetting to pack my regular trimmer when I go on trips.  I have a second set of most of my toiletries which is always ready to go when I have to head out of town for work.  I think this trimmer is going to be living with my travel toiletries.</li>
    <li> Well made item&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Heavy duty&lt;br /&gt;Great product&lt;br /&gt;Little to expensive&lt;br /&gt;But it is working well as advertised.</li>
    <li> I own this product and it broke with just a few uses. Replacement part will cost almost the same as buying a whole new trimmer. Do not buy is my recommendation.</li>
