<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It works well but if you already have really long lashes it won&#x27;t do much for you but it&#x27;s better than any loreal or any of those.</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara I be ever used! And I ve been using mascara for nearly 45 years! Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this mascara because it makes my lashes so long and thick, people ask me if I have artificial eye lashes. The only thing to remember is that it works best if you put some other mascara on lashes and wait till it dries. Then put several layers of this one, depending how big you want them to appear. The tip on top is great for holding mascara brush vertically and adjusting individual lashes.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried all mascaras out there and there is no better one than this!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much!&lt;br /&gt;a.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re Real is the best mascara I&amp;#34;ve ever used and my make-up drawer is full of new products that don&#x27;t deliver. It doesn&#x27;t clump and it delivers in length and fullness.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I read reviews about it all over the internet. Usually I have to use 2 different mascaras to get the look I want so I decided if this product creates the illusion of fake lashes that it would be perfect for me. Unfortunately this product still clumps and does not make my eyelashes look thicker OR longer. It coats my eyelashes with a gross, rubbery texture and is a complete nightmare to get off of my eyelashes. I have pulled out more eyelashes trying to get this product off than I have pulled out in my entire life. I wish I could get my money back and spend it on a $7 mascara that does the job better.</li>
    <li> Usually, this is my favorite mascara. This time, however, the mascara was stringy and gooey but not clumpy. I&#x27;m really surprised and will need to rethink whether I&#x27;ll try it again.</li>
    <li> Not worth the extra $$ though the reviews were a great sell to me.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* It&#x27;s mascara and it&#x27;s black.&lt;br /&gt;* Does not flake off.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;* It is hell to remove.&lt;br /&gt;* Does a great job of creating tarantula lashes... gloppy and nasty.(Yes, I&#x27;ve used MANY different mascara&#x27;s in my life... I am not new to this game)&lt;br /&gt;* Feels like I have plastic lashes.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d rather go without mascara than use this.  Seriously.  I&#x27;m delighted for those who find it amazing.&lt;br /&gt;It IS possible I received a bad batch.  The mascara came wrapped in bubble pack but no box.  It did not appear used nor was it advertised as used.&lt;br /&gt;I am SO glad I tried it.  Now I know... marketing works but this mascara does not suit me.</li>
    <li> The mascara came in the box in perfect condition.  Well packaged and quickly shipped and received. If you are looking for long lashes, this is it.  Just know the wand is a bit sharp so use carefully.  I get asked if my lashes are real or not all the time.  :-). Good luck.</li>
    <li> I have always had friends and family swear by a certain brand of mascara that they always go to and love the results. I had never really felt that with a mascara till I happen to receive a tube of this mascara as a gift from a friend. This mascara is amazing!! It makes my lashes which are about a average length and thickness and turns them into looking like I put on fake eyelashes. It makes them super long and thick without clumping or making my lashes look like spider legs. It also stays for a very long time despite not being a waterproof formula. The only thing that I am not so fond of is how incredibly hard it is to remove. It definitely takes some elbow grease getting it off. Despite this one nuance I will continue to use, because of the amazing results.</li>
    <li> I was expecting more. I get the same results using drug store products ( loreal&#x27;s telescopic) and it&#x27;s less expensive. Didn&#x27;t live up to the hype for me.</li>
    <li> Decided to give this mascara a whirl mainly due to the snappy title of it.  Wow!  It lives up to it&#x27;s name.  My lashes look amazingly long, stay seperated and it doesn&#x27;t flake off.  Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> I cant stress enough how happy I am with this mascara. It really opens up the eye and extends your lashes. They look amazing with this stuff! No primer needed just brush on slowly from base of lashes up brushing your lashes into the curl you want! Its hands down the best mascara.</li>
    <li> I am not one to try many things.  I don&#x27;t have money to waste and find that many items don&#x27;t live up to my expectations.  Once I find one that does, I stick with it.  Well, this mascara is not gimmicky as, to me, it does what it advertises.  I love it.  My lashes are lengthened and appear thicker after using this product.  I am allergic to a lot of cosmetics and find that many mascaras make my eyes water and itch.  I don&#x27;t have that problem with this one.  In summary, I don&#x27;t mind paying money for cosmetics that produce good results and are hypoallergenic. Unless the company changes the way it makes this product, so far so good.  This one is a keeper!</li>
    <li> A friend of mine told me about this mascara. Her makeup always looks great so I thought I should try it.  I used it and as soon as I put it on I could see the clumps. I called her and she conveniently forgot to mention that she has to comb them out, but for her it was worth it because it looked so good afterwards.  However, I am not going to do extra work for a product.  I gave it to her and she loves it so at least it didn&#x27;t go to waste</li>
    <li> My sister told me \\&quot;It looks like you&#x27;re wearing false eyelashes\\&quot; one night when we were out. When I first got this mascara I hated it, but I kept working with it - mostly because all my other mascaras did little to nothing on my tiny lashes. My lashes are less than half an inch long, and with this mascara I get tons of curl and volume. The tip of the brush really helps with getting the look I want. I just press it into my lashes after applying it holding the brush horizontally. There does seem to be a little bit too much product on the tip when you first take the brush out of the tube, but I just wipe it off this way I&#x27;m sure I won&#x27;t get clumpy lashes. This is the only mascara I use now - I love it!</li>
    <li> I love the body this mascara gives my lashes. It does a great job of separating, lengthening, and voumizing because the brush has such little bristles. One of my favorite things, though, is how long this mascara lasts- I put it on in the morning, work at a day camp, work out, sweat like crazy, and before bed, I still have to use makeup remover to pull it off my lashes. While I don&#x27;t know how it stands up against tears, it otherwise is incredibly waterproof.</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara I have ever used.  It&#x27;s a little pricey but worth the money (I use mostly drug store makeup or very marked down on sale items other than mascara. I find that mascara is the only product that is really worth the higher cost).  The only thing that I don&#x27;t love is how the mascara goes from good to dried out very quickly.  Over a month or 2 I get awesome results, then very quickly it dries up and doesn&#x27;t apply as nicely.  I always order 2 when I buy them so I can be ready for when this happens (because it really does seem sudden to me) and when I open my last one I order 2 more.  Works for me.  Regardless my lashes are dark and appear longer with NO CLUMPING no matter how many coats I have applied!  I usually make a huge mess smudging the mascara all over my eyelids but for whatever reason this doesn&#x27;t happen to me when I use Benefit.  Lastly during the day my mascara has a tendency to get flakey and collect on my cheek bones or even irritate my eyes if I use any other product.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara, but this time, the brush was all messed up. I had to clean and use the brush from my last tube. The replacement brush didn&#x27;t fit into the new tube, so I am stuck with two tubes and switching back and forth between them. Ugh! As long as you get one with a good brush, you are good to go and it works great!</li>
    <li> I can tell by the box, the tube, and the formula, this product is fake. I didn&#x27;t even bother using it.</li>
    <li> My lashes are very straight and I have to really work at them with a curler.  After all that effort, mascara usually weighs them down, then I have to re-curl and get mascara all over the curler... you get the idea.  This masacara doesn&#x27;t weigh them down, but actually helps keep the curl. It separates really well, just follow the instructions it gives you.  I was unsure about spending $22 on mascara, but I just love the way this makes my eyes look.  I used to buy a drug store brand, but this change might actually be worth the cost.</li>
    <li> I have been a dental assistant for 20 years now &amp; have always had mascara under my eyes by lunchtime. Partly because my face is fat &amp; partly because you sweat with a mask &amp; glasses on &amp; are always looking down. This mascara stays where you put it. It isn&#x27;t hard to remove, it just stays on my lashes. Great product!!</li>
    <li> I have sparse straight lashes but with this mascara they look amazing. Can clump up if you put on to fast. I use philosophy purity to remove. lashes look dark,longer, thicker, separated and curled everything i ever wanted in a mascara. P/S i live in Phoenix AZ and when it was 115 degrees outside it stayed on all day. this clumps if not careful is why didn&#x27;t give 5 stars</li>
    <li> I really like this mascara and think it is very useful. It is probably one of my favorite types of mascara to use. It really works. It is very useful for when you do not have very long eyelashes, or very many. It makes your eyelashes look really good.This Benefit Mascara gives your eyelashes a lot of volume, curls them, and makes them look really long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I used this mascara my eyelashes were flat, looked short, and you could hardly see them at all. When I put on the Benefit Mascara you could really see the difference. I don&#x27;t think that there is anything I don&#x27;t like about this mascara. My eyelashes were curled, there was a lot of volume in them,  and they looked way longer than they did before. I even asked some family members and they really like it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also really like the brush. It has a round tip, which makes it easier to use. And the brush is just the right size, not to big, and not too little. This Benefit Mascara is $25.00. It is definitely worth spending the money on. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> As a loyal Benefit Cosmetics customer I have to say that this mascara is 10X better than their other mascara, BadGal.  I don&#x27;t wear a ton of makeup but because this mascara does such a good job providing volume AND length, it definitely is my go to for a quick fix.  If you&#x27;re looking for a great mascara, look no further.</li>
    <li> This is really great mascara.  With ONE coat it absolutely made my lashes look much thicker and longer.  I&#x27;ve never seen anything like it.  I even had to post before and after photos on facebook because I was so surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t particularly notice any \\&quot;curl\\&quot; from the mascara, but I use an eyelash curler before applying.  There was very minor flaking, but hardly noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wore it to work all day, out later that night, then came home and fell into bed.  Upon waking in the morning and realizing I&#x27;d forgotten to take my makeup off the night before, I was amazed when I looked in the mirror and didn&#x27;t have \\&quot;raccoon eyes\\&quot;.  No smudging!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE it.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best mascara ever. My eyelashes look amazing. Really does give you that full lash look! :D WORTH THE MONEY!</li>
    <li> I have been using Latisse and needed to find the perfect mascara to show off the growth...This was absolutely perfect!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to save everyone a bunch of time and money because I&#x27;ve already tried every mascara out there. I tried the cheap drugstore brands (Cover Girl, Rimmel, Almay) to the more expensive stuff (Clinique, Lancome, Guerlain...). This is, hands down, the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.  (Oddly enough, Rimmel&#x27;s Glam Eyes is a close second).  I has SERIOUS reservations about spending so much on mascara. It&#x27;s going to cost you a solid $23 no matter where you go (believe me, I&#x27;ve looked), but my dad was right: you definitely get what you pay for.  It doesn&#x27;t smear, and you get the full package: length and fullness (why just pick one??).  I noticed in one of the seller&#x27;s questions, they said that the mascara doesn&#x27;t wash off easily.  I haven&#x27;t had the same experience.  It comes right off for me with soap and water....no special removers necessary, yet it stays on all day and I can also add more to it if I want without it looking like a hot mess.  (Mad props to the seller for just trying to being honest though!). It just keeps getting better with each layer.  I would start off with the mini version ($10) to try it out before committing to the larger one, but I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have short invisible lashes. This plumped them and gave me additional length-without looking like spider legs.  It only took 2 coats.  They didn&#x27;t look \\&quot;fake\\&quot; like they suggest but, I felt I good about my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;The down side it that it dries out very quickly, after 30 days of use it was too clumpy to maneuver-I had to use a eyelash comb on a regular basis.  Also, it requires full removal nightly. I was too lazy to remove and could not separate my lashes to reapply the next day. Just a bit too high maintainabce for this girl!</li>
    <li> most mascaras are all the same, but this one actually worked well. it made my eyelashes look fuller AND longer. the only downsides are that it&#x27;s not waterproof. after i shower, the mascara is all over my cheeks and i have to scrub at my face a lot to get it all off. still, this doesn&#x27;t really affect my opinion of this mascara so much since it works so well and does what it says it does.</li>
    <li> What an overrated pot of shoepolish! It is unbelievably inky...it takes ages for it to come off; the brush takes ages to get used to, the rounded bit in the end hurts my eye, and I dont see how it is better than the drugstore cheap versions.  I feel like I was robbed off, especially since I bought it in Europe. I dont think I will buy Benefit products anymore.</li>
    <li> I simply adore this mascara.  It does what many mascaras have claimed to do: make my lashes look thicker and longer!  I only tried this product because I was given a sample at Sephora and I was so thoroughly impressed with it that I went back the next week and bought a full size tube and have never purchased another kind of mascara since.</li>
    <li> This product is far too expensive not to work. It doesn&#x27;t go on as well as much less expensive mascaras &amp; it has a weird odor . It clumps , does not separate. . . in a word. . . .DON&#x27;T !</li>
    <li> Mascara is Mascara...right? they are all the same, right?&lt;br /&gt;WRONG!&lt;br /&gt;Having used a wand to apply this pigment to my lashes for more than 27 years I have never found a mascara I have loved as much as this one.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;Re Real! is magnificently true. It isnt waterproof but who cares! its not like it drips down the second it mists outside, girl buy an umbrella if you are so worried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips to using? Use the wand vertically to really lift those lashes high, save the application till the very last step in applying makeup to not have powder or eyeshadow dust it up, Wiggle the wand through your lashes while going to the inner corner of your eye and then pull towards the outer corner this will make them SO FULL!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never buy another brand again!</li>
    <li> I really like this mascara. It gives my lashes some serious \\&quot;oomph\\&quot; without being too overdone. It is more of a volumizing mascara than a lengthening mascara, just FYI, and I&#x27;ve experienced some mild flaking issues, but otherwise it&#x27;s great. The color is also super black, which I love. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Like this mascara. Goes on good and will buy again&lt;br /&gt;Thank you and I will let others know&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michelle C.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many mascaras in the past. Clinique, Estee Lauder, YSL, the drug store junk. NONE of them perform this way. I have very long lashes, but not enough volume. I sincerely thought this was going to end up in the \\&quot;make up junk drawer\\&quot;, but decided to try it anyway since it wasn&#x27;t very expensive. Am I happy I did!! This mascara is amazing!! The brush is awesome, it finds lashes I didn&#x27;t even know I had. It lengthens (not a bonus for me) and REALLY gives your lashes volume like you&#x27;ve never had before. I feel like I just won the mascara lottery!! Simply put, you won&#x27;t believe your eyes!</li>
    <li> A month or so ago, I read about \\&quot;They&#x27;re Real\\&quot; in an online blog.  It was written by a lady, who writes a wonderful blog and has given many, many wonderful tips.  Well, when she said how great this mascara was...I knew it had to be great.  Today, I&#x27;m confirming that again, what she said was great ...really is great.  I also found that my lashes appear much thicker.  Be sure to read the instructions on holding the brush correctly.  Yeah, it makes a difference in how thick they appear...just holding the brush as suggested.</li>
    <li> Nice brush evenly applies the mascara without clumps. No smudging throughout the day. Gives more of a lengthening look than volumizing.</li>
    <li> A friend told my about this mascara. Now I&#x27;m hooked. The only one I will ever buy. No other mascara has held up my lashes.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I spent over thirty dollars for this mascara. That&#x27;s the only reason I haven&#x27;t thrown it away. It&#x27;s no better than any drugstore brand. It is also  extremely hard to wash off. Even make-up remover barely gets it off. Wish I didn&#x27;t get.</li>
    <li> I have read a ton of reviews on this, but I wasn&#x27;t sure how a mascara could possibly be worth that much money, but it really is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a make-up novice trying to improve my skills but this stuff is a god send.  A single coat makes lashes look darker and longer without looking fake (even one coat of regular mascara looks more fake with fewer improvements)... two coats plus and you are staying at eyelashes you didn&#x27;t think were possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paying more for this mascara is a better investment than all my other make-up since a single coat of this can make my face look done, before I apply any kind of foundation or blush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love Love Love</li>
    <li> The brush is alright, the ball on the end takes a lot of getting used to.  The product is wet and waxy, and immediately flakes when applied.  One coat or three, it is flaky and difficult to work with.  Overall impression is not good; there are drug store products that are far superior, not as messy and do not make your lashes look like spider legs.</li>
    <li> I definitely expected a little bit more from a Mascara called \\&quot;they&#x27;re real!\\&quot; especially having heard such glowing reviews about it.  That being said, it&#x27;s still definitely a great product, gets great results and looks wonderful.  I generally buy Sephora&#x27;s waterproof black/brown mascara and see similar if not the exact same results, but they&#x27;re the same price anyhow, I&#x27;d say either would be great.</li>
    <li> ...but almost too rich if that&#x27;s possible.  goes on so thick that it takes minutes to dry.  as a mom of 3, i don&#x27;t have that kind of time.  totally bugged when it smudges on my eye lid of under eye before drying.  #firstworldproblems</li>
    <li> I had recieved a sample of this product Nd am some what of a make up lover. This product is expensive but worth it!</li>
    <li> Do not buy this mascara!!!!  It is a counterfeit and the mascara is not the real thing!!!  It&#x27;s gloppy, stringy mess!!!  The real stuff is amazing, but I know this is NOT the REAL BRAND even though the bottle &amp; brush are the same.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be fooled by the low price!</li>
    <li> I love this it make me look like I am wearing false lashes because this mascara makes my very short lashes look long and Beautiful!!</li>
    <li> i love. It is the best mascara i ever used!!!! U definitely should try it, firstly i bought it in sephora</li>
    <li> I have tried a million mascara&#x27;s. My lashes need lots of help. This mascara is good, the brush has a round head at the end so you can get all those hard to reach lashes. It does make your lashes long, better then most products I&#x27;ve tried. The reason I won&#x27;t buy it again is because I found it very hard to get off. I don&#x27;t like to put my lashes through that, I want to keep them not have them come out from rubbing too much. So I guess I would say give it a try.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll be brief and to the point.  I used this product and it was a chore to remove with my Almay eye makeup remover.  A few lashes fell off in the process (even after I was so very gentle). It clumped my lashes something terrible and felt uncomfortable on.  The tube hit the garbage can after one use. I am going back to my drug store faves.  This one is certainly not a winner.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I don&#x27;t understand the Amazon price of $62.  Is this a mistake?  You can get it all over the internet for $22.  HSN and the Benefit Co. both have it for $22.</li>
    <li> Fortunately, my mother brought this mascara at the flea market brand new for a buck. This is the BEST mascara ! I don&#x27;t think I will be trying another or  be purchasing from any other brands. It defines, lengthen, and curls my lashes indiviuals. They should have named this falsies instead of that medicore kind from maybelline.If you are interested in buying this wonderful product go to SEPHORA.COM search  for benefits products and you will find this amazing product for 22 dols,so much more reasonable for that price.&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> This is by far the best mascara I&#x27;ve used!  I have never had good lashes but with this mascara I get major oomph!  They really pop out and the wand is great at separating and making it look like you have more lashes than you really do.</li>
    <li> I purchased this from Sephora after reading a glamour magazine blurb about how great this mascara was (she included a picture with her tweet and they looked thick and dark). This mascara just didn&#x27;t do the trick for me. I am forever being duped into buying expensive mascara when drug store products usually work the best for me. Among the more expensive brands I have tried are Dior&#x27;s Diorshow, Givenchy&#x27;s Phenomen&#x27;Eyes, Smashbox Lash DNA, and a few others that cost way too much. The mascara that is better than all of those for me is a simple covergirl product, purple tube (the one Drew Barrymore promotes). I also used to get a lot of compliments when I used a Rimmel one that came in a red tube. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll continue to spend money on mascaras that promise to give me \\&quot;lashes like a doll\\&quot; and don&#x27;t deliver. Overall, this product was just average for me-maybe I have weird lashes? Or am expecting too much.</li>
    <li> I really like the mascara, but it did not make my lashes look as incredible as promised.  I think the Bad Gal Lash actually makes them look a little longer and thicker.  This mascara does make my lashes curl as promised though.  I think my favorite mascara is the smaller sized Bad Gal Lash as I tend to have my mascara dry up before I used the whole container.</li>
    <li> I bought this mascara a few months and ago, in my opinion it is the Best ever, I have tried it all from chanel, Clinique, Dior, etc. I consider this is the Best $22 you will spend, love the thick brush it helps get to every lash there is, it wears well with no smudging, don&#x27;t think I will use anything else from now on, I have recommended this to all my friends!</li>
    <li> i bought this for my mom and she loves it. whenever she wears it she always gets compliments on her lashes</li>
    <li> I use all benefit products and generally speaking love them.  This mascara is amazing and does wonders- the down side?  Soap and water isn&#x27;t going to cut it, you have to buy special eye makeup remover cloths to get it off and somehow it still starts to smudge and flake on your face after about 7 hours of wear.  Final word? Great for a special event, not worth the hassle every day.</li>
    <li> Love the brush, but i would have raccoon eyes after a few hours, same for my mom who i also bought a tube :-(</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of different mascaras, and, like most, this one has its pros and cons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the jet-black color of this mascara, and it definitely does make my lashes look longer and fuller, and the black color makes them look much more dramatic and does make my eyes pop a bit more.  I still use an eyelash curler before application, as I have not noticed any curling effect of the mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mascara dries really fast - if you aren&#x27;t quick in getting a second coat on, prepare for clumping which will be hard to undo.  You also really cannot use it on your lower lashes, as the brush is so large it will get everywhere.  It stays on well all day, and I have not had any problems with raccoon eyes, even when I work out at the gym while wearing it.  However, it is harder to remove at night, and requires make-up remover or it leaves raccoon eyes and flakes everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the disadvantages of this product, I still bought a second tube.  I feel that the benefits of the more dramatic look outweighs the extra work in application and removal.</li>
    <li> This mascara is great. I have bought in stores and it&#x27;s really high. This seller  is good and this product is worth buying!!</li>
    <li> My favorite mascara on the market right now. It really does look like I&#x27;m wearing falsies. I was so shocked and happy to get it at such a great deal on here.</li>
    <li> I cannot recommend this mascara enough.  I am a little embarrassed to be so enthusiastic about something so mundane as mascara, but the hype on this product is completely true.  First, I love the WAND:  It is flexible, and the plastic brush is perfect.  The little burst of brushes at the end of the wand really helps to go back and get all those little hairs that are almost impossible to get without smudging the whole thing.  Second: The mascara formula is just the right amount of thickness--and have taken my almost completely invisible lashes to lush and long lashes.  I don&#x27;t know how it works, but the lashes are also curling up too--something I have never seen with any other mascara before.  I have used mascara that made the lashes long, but they were straight out-- and often touched my glasses lenses. These are amazing-- no curling wand necessary.  Finally:  My eyes are pretty sensitive--I have had swelling and watery eyes with some mascara.  But this formula is not bothering my eyes at all.  No watering-- no itching.  It feels like I have nothing on my eyes.  If you are looking for a great mascara-- BUY THIS NOW.  You will not regret.  I already have purchased additional mascaras for my daughters too.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara. But since I have blonds eye leashes, I use a different mascara to cover lashes completely and then apply this as a second coat to get them looking as good as false lashes.</li>
    <li> For the price, I really did not see much difference from this product to less expensive mascaras.  It was shipped quickly and I was thankful but I didn&#x27;t see any big difference for my lashes.</li>
    <li> Love it! It works! It stay up all day and people think they are mine. Now my sister use it too.</li>
    <li> This wasn&#x27;t any better that my store bought and I still love Colossal better.... especially for the price.  Wouldn&#x27;t purchase againt for sure.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this stuff and swears it is the greatest mascara she has ever used.  The local brick and mortar reseller was out, so we bought on Amazon from Lala &amp; Co.  Again, my wife is very familiar with the real stuff - loves it, loves the brush, etc.  What we received had a typo in the label (the URL had an \\&quot;a\\&quot; at the end where the real one does not), the brush was about 1/4\\&quot; shorter and bent differently and the trademark tip was totally different, it had a weird smell and the consistency was NOTHING like the real thing.  My wife says to strongly recommend this product - but make sure you are getting the ACTUAL product.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the benefit mascara...however...when I received my mascara..it was OLD, THICK, and CLUMPY.. I had to discard it.  Such a disappointment.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;I am mascara addicted. This mascara offers everything to my opinion. It making my lashes longer and thicker. I like to bend the wand at 45 degrees, it helps to get to the very corners of the eye without making mess. I like this product, but it&#x27;s a little bit tough to take off. I have to wash my face twice to get it off completely\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this mascara!  I got it based on a review at [...] and it has more than lived up to the hype.  I usually have a problem with my mascara getting all clumpy or else it doesn&#x27;t look like I am wearing any, but this stuff avoids both of those problems.</li>
    <li> All I can say is WOW. dramatic results in a tiny canister!! This is my new favorite mascara! Dramatically lengthens and curls my extra straight lashes. I&#x27;m excited!!</li>
    <li> have tried many brands and this one does what it claims. does not clump and makes eyelashes look so great</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this mascara! The brush has tiny fibers on the tip so I am able to get into the corners of my eyelases. The brush runs through my lashes very easily and there is no snag. Not sure if everyone knows what I mean, but when you apply several layers of mascara, it my appear to be &amp;#34;caked on&amp;#34;. This mascara adds volume and thickness without looking busted or run-down. When I use this mascara, I get tons of compliments on my lashes. I would definitely recommend this product to each and all.</li>
    <li> i was disappointed in this product - looking for a good mascara that adds length and volume.  i didn&#x27;t notice much difference between this and any other mascara products</li>
    <li> I would like to start off by saying that I naturally have long dark lashes. When I was younger I used to spend the big bucks on DiorShow and other department brand mascaras. Soon I learned that I drug store brands did the job as well. After years of using Loreal, I decided to stray again. My cousin told me about this and I bought it at Ulta. I was very impressed. I enjoy the thick rubbery brush. It helps brush lashes long and keeps them from clumping. Unlike Loreal, this mascara does not tend to run as much either. It stays true all day without leaving any debris behind. If you make any mistakes its easy to clean with Q-tip. I use two coats and it really looks like they are fake. Removing the mascara is a breeze, not oily at all. I would reccomend if you have the cash to purchase over drug store brands.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara. It really defines and resists clumping. It is a little pricey, which is why it only has four stars.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried using the &amp;#34;mini&amp;#34; size/bonus sample size of this three different times (three different samples) and each time I get the same result; clumpy/spidery lashes that are more individually defined but end up looking thinner overall. I&#x27;ve seen so many great reviews for this but getting a consistent result across multiple samples tells me it wasn&#x27;t just the batch that I had the first time. I&#x27;ll stick to Benefit&#x27;s Bad Gal Lash mascara. It&#x27;s not as liquid looking on the lashes but for me the Bad Gal Lash always makes my overall lash line look much fuller and longer.</li>
    <li> I have used this mascara for a week now and absolutely love it!!! my eyelashes have never looked so long and feathery with any other mascara i have ever used... i will definitely continue to use this product and sing their praises to all my friends!! it cost more than i have ever paid for mascara before but worth it!!</li>
    <li> Usually only stick to the mascara I know works but decided to try this one. I have tried all types of mascaras and I have to say that this has become my new favorite. The formula doesn&#x27;t crumble off and spaces them well. One thing that I like about it but what some people might not find attractive is that it clumps the eyelashes I like that look it makes my eyelashes look fuller.</li>
    <li> Just your average ordinary stay at home mom here...I bought a sample size of this mascara and love it. I can&#x27;t tell you what the secret is, but it works amazingly well, honest!!! I especially like the applicator, it&#x27;s a bit spiky, which helps separate the lashes. Can&#x27;t imagine what the neg. reviews are all about!? Is it possible this listing is an impostor? That is my only explanation for any negative reviews. Get a sample at Ulta, you will be pleased.</li>
    <li> I liked it, but wouldn&#x27;t order again for the price.  I didn&#x27;t think it was that great and it I really didn&#x27;t care for the applicator (I keep a &amp;#34;favorite&amp;#34; applicator on hand for situations like these!)  So it was a nice mascara, especially when used with a different applicator.  I like my eyelashes separated, not clumped together.  Cover Girl in the Purple tube is by far the best for a &#x27;cheaper&#x27; brand and would recommend that over this, especially for the price.  I am a junkie and have tried them all and will likely keep on trying every new one that comes out with promises of drop dead gorgeous lashes, lol.  My personal splurge is Estee Lauder Sumptuous mascara.</li>
    <li> I saw this on hsn and had to try it. Did not disappoint. Wears well. Doesn&#x27;t smudge. Great in the rain although not waterproof. My only negative remark is that it goes on a little thick. Tough to touch up later in the day. But I will definately buy it again and would recommend you give it a try. Especially if you have light or short eyelashes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never written a product review before, but after seeing the positive responses on here, I had to weigh in...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this mascara as a present in my Christmas stocking this year. I love Benefit cosmetics (LOVE LOVE LOVE their [[ASIN:B000FBF5BI BADgal Lash Mascara]]), but I hated this mascara! It goes on dark, but it is so clumpy and makes my eyelashes look thin and wiry whilst somehow clumping them together. One of my friends also bought it and asked if any of us wanted it because she was so dissatisfied with the product. I&#x27;ve tried many drugstore brand and department store brand mascaras, and this is simply not a winner! Check out [[ASIN:B000FBF5BI Benefit Cosmetics BADgal Lash Mascara]] instead! [I also love Sephora brand Mascaras for a bargain option].</li>
    <li> The name says it all!  My lashed look truly great, and it stays all day until I take it off!  This is my new favorite mascara!</li>
    <li> My Benefit Mascara is with travel size is a wonderful duo; like the brush applicator.  Good black color; stays moist.</li>
    <li> I have ordered multiple times from Amazon without issue however, this product was &#x27;sold and shipped&#x27; by an outside vendor, JTSC Outlet, the package arrived without any individual protective wrapping which left me slightly apprehensive and the mascara wand did not look anything like the close ups with the &#x27;ball&#x27; at the tip.  After convincing myself I was over-reacting I tried the mascara, as other reviewers have mentioned you must apply this product very slowly and carefully, it is super easy to smudge onto your eyelid.  The black is much more dramatic than other &#x27;blackest-black&#x27; mascaras I&#x27;ve used which does tend to make your eyelashes stand out a bit more.  The effect I got wasn&#x27;t as dramatic as some claim but it is still a good &#x27;night on the town&#x27; mascara, I won&#x27;t go through the effort required for daily wear, removal requires a little more effort as others have noted, I use cold cream and tissue which works fine but requires a bit more effort than drugstore mascara.  I will purchase this product again but, sorry Amazon, I will buy direct from the manufacturer.</li>
    <li> This is the most I have ever paid for mascara. I usually buy something in Wally-World for about $6 or $7. I have very thin, very pale lashes and without mascara you can&#x27;t even tell that I have lashes. I use an eyelash curler (I know that does not help with thin lashes, but if I don&#x27;t use it my lashes stick straight down towards my chin)and most \\&quot;volumizing\\&quot; or \\&quot;thickening\\&quot; mascaras that I have tried are heavy formulas that weigh my lashes down,they will not hold the curl and I end up carefully wiping the little black flecks of mascara that appear on my face during the course of a day. I don&#x27;t know what kind of wonderfull voodoo they used creating Benefit&#x27;s They&#x27;re Real, but when I put it on it stays put all day long and my lashes look thick but defined. I have experienced absolutely zero flaking or smudging. I will never buy any other brand of mascara again! Note: when applying do NOT put any pressure on the wand! You just need to barely touch the brush to you lashes, otherwise you will have some lashes clumping together.</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara i have ever used!  I don&#x27;t like waterproof mascara so this is the next best thing. No flaking or smudging and it comes off easily when you take it off.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical with the mascara but when I used it I loved it because it does make my eyelashes look longer. I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Great mascara that leaves your lashes long and very black! I normally use Tarte Lights Camera Lashes, but this one works a bit better. Awesome seller as well!</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever purchased!!! Want a natural yet dramatic look? This would be my 1st choice!</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this on my birthday trip to sephora.  I was super excited to try it because of all the great reviews.  It is apparently the number one selling mascara in the UK right now, that&#x27;s pretty impressive if you ask me!  I wanted to try it, but I also wanted it for free.  I would actually go an purchase a full size of it because I LOVE the wand on this mascara.  I prefer the plastic wants a lot more and this one has really defined bristles.  Therefore, the brush grips your lashes very very well.  The formula is not too dry and a bit more on the wet side, which is also what I prefer.  It doesn&#x27;t flake, but it does clump if you put too many coats on.  Really, two coats is ideal with this product.  I&#x27;m glad I got to try it and it&#x27;ll last me awhile.</li>
    <li> Not worth the money.  The drugstore version is essentially the same.  The brush just doesn&#x27;t do much volume-wise.  There are much better options for the price.</li>
    <li> The item I was shipped by Rose Cosmetics was counterfit and it smelled like car grease. I would hate to see what would happen if you got it in your eyes. I was refunded my money right away but since this experience I only buy the real thing through Sephora so I know it will be the real deal.</li>
    <li> Ok, I saw this product on HSN and decided to give it a whirl. I am blonde with fine lashes and they always look short when I put on mascara. I should have bought it at HSN and got 2 for the price of 1, but I waited and then the deal was gone. I ended up purchasing on amazon with the free shipping and bought 2 tubes.  The mascara goes on dark and doesn&#x27;t lengthen the lashes like it advertises. In fact, your lashes will NOT look like the lashes on the pack of mascara. This is a pain to wash off and I got out of the shower looking like a raccoon.  One of my kids screamed and said, what happened to your eyes mom?  I too, like the other reviewer am always duped into buying expensive mascara.  Save your money and purchase the REVLON with primer.  This is about $8.99 at wal-mart and works a thousand percent better!</li>
    <li> This product isn&#x27;t even that great. It&#x27;s not even the &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; either. It smudges, clumps and doesn&#x27;t give me that great of a result I want. I could&#x27;ve just bought a cheaper mascara from the drugstore and it would&#x27;ve given me better results. Still, there hasn&#x27;t been a mascara better than Cherry Blooms Brush on Fibre Lash Extensions. It&#x27;s by far the best and I would recommend Cherry Blooms over anything else. They definitely deliver their promises to you which is up to 300% longer lashes! They&#x27;re basically eyelash extensions in 2 mascara tubes. Also featured on the red carpet too! So you know they work! Totally worth the money for something that works and used by celebrities!</li>
    <li> I love what this mascara did to my lashes, but it dried after just 3 weeks and a few uses.  It&#x27;s too expensive and dried way too quick!!  Maybe, I just received a bad tube.</li>
    <li> First of all I&#x27;ll start by saying I love love lobe the way this product made my eyelashes look I was so impressed however, after less than a month my mascara had dried up and my friend who had referred me to try this make up, hers also dried up in less than a month. It was amazing I must say at First just wish it had lasted longer for $23.00.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara. It doesn&#x27;t take a lot of strokes to get the optimum effect. The applicator/brush/wand features hard plastic nubs rather than hair-like fibers. I have found in the past couple years that the plastic nub-type brush really does help apply the mascara more evenly and easily without as many clumping issues. But this brush is even better: it has added bristles at the end of the brush which really helps to get into the corners of the eyes and right at the base of each lash. The result is maximum length with minimum effort. The mascara is a true, dark black and gives the appearance of fake lashes. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This mascara is the best. It lengthens, curls, volumizes, and separates. I had no clumps and it is Jet blacker really. Is grey, and now I don&#x27;t have to use ten different tubes to get the same results minus the clumps. Will definitely buy again. Buyer beware there are some fakes though!</li>
    <li> It did not do what it said! Any cheap mascar would do the same! Big waste of money.the bad girl lash is much better.</li>
    <li> This is terrific mascara; I don&#x27;t use anything else. I wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive, but that&#x27;s the only thing wrong with it.</li>
    <li> I have promised myself never to buy this product on line again.  I don&#x27;t know how but the product in the tube is NOT the same stuff you get at Sephora.  Don&#x27;t be fooled by the price!!!!</li>
    <li> love it i use it every day people at work just keep looking at me ,,,but i dont say a word but they do say some thing fdiffrence about you i just smile :)</li>
    <li> I really like the way this mascara is gentle on my lashes. It doesn&#x27;t make them as long as I&#x27;d hoped, however for the gentle nature, I truly carry it everywhere in case I need it.</li>
    <li> I did not like this mascara, it did not work for me the way it was described. Really hated the brush (this is probably why it didn&#x27;t work well), and the product went dry quickly. Will stick to my favorite Dior fro mnow on, which is expensive too but the result is great....</li>
    <li> I am not sure it is worth what I paid for it. Over the counter mascara works just as well.</li>
    <li> I love it, I use Benefit cosmetic only and this is one of the best purchases. Stays on all day, doesn&#x27;t clump or smear, looks fresh, and doesn&#x27;t irritate the eyes. Lashes look longer , fuller and pretty:)</li>
    <li> This was the most disappointing purchase ever! This was dried out upon opening it! It must have been very old products and I do want to hear from this seller. I paid 17.99 and could have got the fresh product that worked without gunking your eyelashes. For 24.00 from Ulta I could have had the real deal. I lost my money on this one and should hear from this seller, A refund is totally in order! I am a good customer and should be cared for!</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara I have ever used.....  lives up to everything it claims.  I recommend it to all my family and friends</li>
    <li> Awesome product!  Goes on great, separates, thickens and stays put!  I used to use Lancome Definicils but like this much better!</li>
    <li> This is, hands-down, the BEST mascara ever made.  At first I was all &#x27;you&#x27;ve got to be kidding me....twenty-plus bucks for mascara????&#x27;, but I&#x27;m on my fifth tube and don&#x27;t even think twice about the price.  It gives you long, separate, fluttery lashes with one coat.  Subsequent coats build volume (not my taste - I prefer long, skinny lashes).  The tip of the brush is great for getting the inner corners, or putting a little extra emphasis on the outer corners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear mascara almost every day - it&#x27;s my don&#x27;t-leave-home-without-it item.  I used to also use liner almost daily, and with this mascara I find I don&#x27;t need it to feel put together - you get a lot of impact with just this one product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not clump or flake. Holds a curl.  Stays on all day.  Water resistant but easy to remove with cleanser.  Perfection.</li>
    <li> Hands down the best mascara I have tried. It never clumps and the brush is awesome. I just wish it was a bit cheaper</li>
    <li> I would not recommend. It is very clumpy even after wiping it. There are better, less expensive products out there.</li>
    <li> If this came in a waterproof version I&#x27;d never need to try another mascara in my life. I got my mom hooked on it and now it&#x27;s all she uses. My only complaint is because it&#x27;s not waterproof it tends to smudge a little bit, so after an hour or so at work I usually pop into the bathroom to clean up my under eye area.</li>
    <li> I have used various brands of mascara in the past and this is one of my favorite brands. I learned of this brand as I visited my dentist office and the dental assistant&#x27;s lashes were long and I could tell they were not fake lashes, so she pulled up the brand on the internet and I immediately searched it on Amazon and I am happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara. easy to apply, it really brings out the hidden small lashes. n gives the look of lots of long lashes, I thought the price was good as compared to the local store here that sells the product. It didn&#x27;t hurt my eyes, or contacts lens</li>
    <li> It just another tube of mascara to me.What more can i say about this? like I said just another tube of mascara.</li>
    <li> This mascara is by far the best I have ever used.  It is shocking how amazingly long your lashes look once it is on! Love this product!</li>
    <li> I love this mascara, the brush makes a HUGE difference over others.  I really love the way this mascara wand grabs my lower lashes and coats each one.  I usually have a problem with my lower lashes.  Other mascaras usually miss most of my lower lashes, continued strokes makes spider lashes or I get mascara on my face instead of my lashes but They&#x27;re Real Mascara works like charm every time.  A few times I&#x27;ve had to use the brush to wipe off excess amounts but that was user error.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mascara is worth every cent spent and between this one, Benefit&#x27;s Bad Girl Mascara (for thickness) or a combo of the two you will have the perfect lashes for any occassion.</li>
    <li> Seriously I have never found a mascara I loved so much!! It is absolutely amazing. I have blonde short lashes, makes it look like I&#x27;m wearing falsies!</li>
    <li> I love this product when I get it from Ulta or Sephora. I&#x27;ve ordered it twice from amazon and it&#x27;s not real! The wand is flimsy and the product is gooey, like black elmer&#x27;s glue. Awful! Don&#x27;t buy it off amazon!</li>
    <li> My favorite, works so good! Never wears off it self. Makes my lashes stand out and there is no clumps.</li>
    <li> My lashes look great! They are now long enough that people can see them! This mascara really does what it says!</li>
    <li> Sorry, but I do not understand what all the fuss is about. This is mediocre mascara and so over-priced!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using mascara for 25 years and this is not a great product.&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally good eyelashes, and I was expecting something notable. This really disappointed. The tube was not even completely full so as to cover the wand tines completely. The actual substance was not good at coverage or curling or thickening. I used it as directed: wiggling it, as I do with all mascaras. Still nothing noteworthy at all. I have had better results with drugstore mascaras.&lt;br /&gt;It IS really hard to remove also. Soap and water followed by oily mascara remover.&lt;br /&gt;I was really disappointed. Going back to my old mascaras. Far better results and much cheaper.</li>
    <li> For the version that was only $10 plus shipping (real price being $23)- I love Benefit mascara, but this is not it. The tube and wand are real, but the mascara concoction is fake. It smells weird, the texture is extra goopy, and the finish is completely wrong from the real product. Be safe and try the real version for the full price. Amazon was great though and refunded me the money. There&#x27;s a reason this one is so much cheaper....beware.</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara I have ever used. It goes on without clumping and it truly looks as if you are wearing (subtle) fake lashes. I would recommend it to anyone. Just a heads up, it is a little harder to remove (which is good, you don&#x27;t want it to rub off!) so be prepared to spend a few minutes removing it. Otherwise it is a life saver!</li>
    <li> This is not the real Benefit They&#x27;re real mascara. It is a knock off I repeat KNOCK OFF. don&#x27;t listen to the other reviews saying it is great!! IT IS NOT REAL. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ITEM!!!! Do not waste your money!!</li>
    <li> I was in Sephora with my mom yesterday to help her find a nail polish and I wandered off, saw this and the employee kept telling me how amazing it was, she said she was wearing it and I liked how it looked on her. I opened the tester and also liked the little ball on the end of the wand, it was different. I didn&#x27;t like the $23 price tag, but the lady was very convincing and talked me into buying it.&lt;br /&gt;So I tried it out that same night when I was going out, holy crap, is it ever clumpy! After only one light coat my lashes were longer, sure, but they were all stuck together like long, thick, black spider legs! I could not seperate them either, not with a comb, not with a disposable wand, they seemed to be glued together. It looked awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first and LAST time I will ever be talked into buying a high end mascara. It&#x27;s not worth the money. It does not perform any better then cheaper mascaras.&lt;br /&gt;I will be going back to my $7 Wet N Wild mascara, that you know actually...WORKS.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best mascaras I have every used and I&#x27;ve used a lot!  It lengthens and separates.  It has be come my primary mascara.</li>
    <li> This was a great mascara. It lengthened and made my lashes super thick and held curl. The brush is great for applying vertically and applying to lower lashes. What I liked best about this product is that I didn&#x27;t have to dip into the tube multiple times to apply enough to both eyes. One dip per eye was enough to get my lashes full, thick, and fluttery, both top and bottom lashes. It didn&#x27;t clump either since the bristles are stiff and comb-like. The reason I can&#x27;t give it a full 5 stars is because it induced a horrible allergic reaction. My eyes burned and itched and watered non-stop. My eyes were red and irritated the rest of the day. It&#x27;s unfortunate because if it hadn&#x27;t been for that, I&#x27;d rate this 5 stars. It really is a wonderful mascara for those who don&#x27;t have sensitive eyes. Those who do should probably skip it.</li>
    <li> I really love this mascara. I bought this one for my niece for Christmas. This makes your eyelashes look really long and thick. I wear a lot of mascara because I just like the way it looks and with this one you don&#x27;t have to put as much on.</li>
    <li> I have sparse, short lashes and have tried every popular mascara you can think of. I can&#x27;t speak to how easy this is to remove (I haven&#x27;t yet) but hey, who cares - it WORKS! Even without curling my lashes first, and with just a quick inital application, I can SEE my lashes. Yippee! The last time they looked this good was when I had extensions put on for the wedding. This is an expensive product, but wayy cheaper than extensions. Yay!</li>
    <li> Not a terrible mascara but not a great one, either. The unique brush design was okay, as far as application goes. Product didn&#x27;t clump, as promised, but didn&#x27;t see any &#x27;amazing&#x27; dramatic enhancement compared to my other mascaras. It also became flaky after half a day of wear. Seems to hold up alright against moisture. Overall, not bad, but not great. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product and was highly disappointed. It is very watery and runny. Not good at all for contact lens wearers. It does make your lashes look long, but throughout the day it turns into a big mess. I will stick with Benefit Bad Gal lash, it hasn&#x27;t let me down yet and if it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it!</li>
    <li> I was so tired of buying every mascara out there as they never did what they claimed...until this one.  I even threw away my eye lash curlers.  I have NEVER had such an awesome mascara.  One coat makes my lashes so long and lovely.  I love the applicator design as well.  I will never spend another dime on any other mascara again.  Easy to put on and easy to take off.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a regular user of Benefit They&#x27;re Real! mascara. However, this is not that product. I&#x27;m not sure if it was a knock-off or perhaps it was just old, but the mascara and wand were totally different. I have one from the store I compared it to and it&#x27;s not the same at all. The wand is flimsy and designed differently, and the mascara comes out in a stringy mess.</li>
    <li> Well, once again I fall hard for the hype.  I must be the perfect person to fall for these ridiculous ad campaigns.  That&#x27;s me int he front row, jumping up and down and screaming &amp;#34;OH Please sir!! Brainwash me first!!  Please!!!).&lt;br /&gt;Long story short:  this is an ordinary mascara.  It creates no spectacular effects.  It did not curl, volumize, or appear to lengthen my eyelashes, even after many reapplications.&lt;br /&gt;The brush is very thin with very short bristles, which don&#x27;t even catch the lashes very well.&lt;br /&gt;So....who knows, maybe you&#x27;ll like it!&lt;br /&gt;Just don&#x27;t fall for the hype like I did.</li>
    <li> I was a loyal Maybeline Lash Stylist user for a long time, until they discontinued it!!  I loved the comb applicator and have wasted so much money recently trying all different brands and styles trying to find something comparable.  I went to my local Ulta store and asked if they had any suggestions.  The girl said she also loved the Maybeline comb mascara (why the hell did they stop making it if everyone loved it????) and said she too tried several products and fell in love with Benefit&#x27;s They&#x27;re Real mascara.  I figured what do I have to lose and bought some and now I&#x27;m hooked!  While it doesn&#x27;t actually say waterproof (which I always buy because the non-waterproof always smudges and flakes) this mascara acts like waterproof!  It lasts all day, no smudges, no flakes.  And the unique brush gives very similar results to the comb, plus has the special tip when used vertically to separate and lengthen.  It is hard to remove with just soap alone, but that&#x27;s good for me, lasts longer!! You just have to get  waterproof mascara remover (which I alread had).  I will definitely be buying this for as long as they keep making it! But my luck, they always get rid of the stuff I like, so fingers crossed!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m extremely picky. This will be the best mascara youve ever tried. Finally the search has stopped for trying to find the best mascara. I love this mascara!</li>
    <li> I purchased this after viewing an infomercial.  I have short lashes and previously used a product that requires application of the extensions first and then the mascara (Maybelline XXL Extensions).  I was quite happy with the Maybelline product as I thought it enhanced my lashes and was easy to remove.  After seeing the results of They&#x27;re Real! Mascara,  I thought this might enhance my lashes even more. Turns out, I get the same results as with the Maybelline product, only I don&#x27;t have to do two applications. Unfortunately, I found this product extremely difficult to remove.  Here&#x27;s my take on it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  Enhances lash length in one application&lt;br /&gt;  Only have to apply a small amount of product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Cost (two times that of Maybelline XXL Extensions)&lt;br /&gt;  Difficult to remove product&lt;br /&gt;  About the same results as Maybelline XXL Extensions</li>
    <li> I purchased Benefit \\&quot;They&#x27;Re Real!\\&quot; Mascara as I read a great review in a magazine.  Unfortunately, this product is one of the worst mascaras I have ever purchased.  It smears on your eye lids even after it is dry.</li>
    <li> It makes my eye lash very long, but it is not water proof. I won&#x27;t buy it any more.It makes my eye lash very long, but it is not water proof. I won&#x27;t buy it any more.</li>
    <li> I have authentic ones that i compared them to and these dont have the same brush, much stubbier and its alot more gooey, buyer beware</li>
    <li> Tis product was recommended to me...so far so good.  I found eye lashes that I didn&#x27;t know were there..wow.  Little expensive but it just might be worth it</li>
    <li> Well, to begging: I am a minimal makeup kind of girl. I like to look and feel natural. I rarely use mascara, just do it for especial occasions and short periods of time. This mascara does the job, my eyes look soo different with this stuff on then without it and it looks natural, of course I just apply one coat but seriously is all that u need!</li>
    <li> I have like most women has tried every mascara there is Lancome just wasn&#x27;t right it looked cakey at end of day lashes fell down, Lancome doll lash horrible, maybelline horrible, revolon liked the 3d photo one but it made my eyes itch, loreal scopic was good but, but didn&#x27;t care for it like I did at first. urban decay supercurl was awesome it lasted all day but you can tell it looked old by end of the night &amp; you can&#x27;t build on them.I have not used covergirl so can&#x27;t judge that one, hard candy horrible made my eye lashs spider looking. but this one dries out to fast it also makes lashes stick together no volume don&#x27;t care for it but good concept</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a week and I am not impressed. My lashes look like spider legs after one application and for having fine, medium length lashes, it does not curl and it does not lengthen. You&#x27;re better off buying great lash by mabeline for a lower price; significantly lower.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m actually really surprised by how much I love this mascara. I had tried a couple other Benefit mascaras and hated them. This one, however, is much different. I have really long lashes that are pretty straight, so when I buy a mascara I need it to hold a curl. They&#x27;re Real! is by far the best one I&#x27;ve tried in terms of that. I can apply a coat or two, curl it and know I am set for a few hours. It&#x27;s awesome. It&#x27;s also very black, which is nice! No flaking or smudging and it&#x27;s super easy to get off. It almost looks like I&#x27;m wearing fake eyelashes when I wear this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Generally I use Diorshow, but I&#x27;ll probably make They&#x27;re Real! my go to from now on. Easier to get off and less smudge. Also a bit more defining. Great product!</li>
    <li> No clumps, long and thick look! LOVE this product...but I also like Revlon 3D just about as much for WAY less money.</li>
    <li> I love the way this mascara makes my lashes look! They make my lashes look longer and fuller which is great! It is not waterproof however it is smudge proof, which works quite well actually. The consistency of it is good, the brush is great.....BUT the bottle dries out rather quickly, then it becomes hard to apply and flaky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would be the perfect mascara if it didn&#x27;t try out so fast!</li>
    <li> I have tried high end mascaras (Chanel, Dior, YSL,etc) to low end mascaras (maybelline, covergirl, revlon etc)....so with that I say that this is the best mascara I have ever tried!...It lengthens, it thickens!...It stays on for days!...Awesome!...I will purchase this time and time again...have already went through 4 of them in one year!</li>
    <li> This was not a legit brand of Benefits this definately had to be a knock off!  It was terrible.  So disappointed.</li>
    <li> Awful formula.  Little control over formula regardless of brush.  Doesn&#x27;t add volume to lashes. Save your money.  I recommend L&#x27;Oreal, Clinique, or even IT.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite mascara of all time. I start by curling my lashes. I then apply a volumizing mascara. Lastly I apply They&#x27;re Real and I get intense length from it! I would suggest buying direct, though, because this is higher priced than either sephora or Benefit Beauty.</li>
    <li> Terrible total fake. I would not recommend to anyone. Next time I know just to spend the money and get it from Sephora.</li>
    <li> I just received this Benefit mascara.  I ordered it on the recommendation of my sister, who said it was the best she had used.  It makes my lashes look very long, and does not seem to have any of the little fibers in it that make lashes look lumpy or clumped.  it works very well. I remove it as i&#x27;m washing my face at night with my regular gentle cleanser, and it doesn&#x27;t seem hard to remove.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for awhile and I love it.  It truly lengthens lashes.  I think it is a little pricey at Sephora so it was nice to find it cheaper on Amazon.</li>
    <li> The benefit &amp;#34;They&#x27;re-al! mascara is the best mascara I ever used, this mascara really make your lashes look fabulous and people usually ask me if they are my reall lashes.</li>
    <li> I am a mascara addicted, I love to prove new formulas and products and this one REALLY does what is supposed to: grow the length of your lashes. I does not multiply the volume, though, but if you are looking for lenght, there is nothing better. I loved it better than MAC, L&#x27;oreal and Maybelline ones. For volume increase, I would combine this product with another one, but I don&#x27;t think is necessary. It is a bit hard to take it off, though.</li>
    <li> I love this seller because I received the item very fast. I also love the item because it works very well. People were actually asking me if my eyelashes were real!</li>
    <li> So i got this mascara last year around oct.  from QVC. It comes with benetint for cheeks and lips and pore professional and eye brow pencil .  It makes my eyebrow thick and long  . It works pretty good for me. And until now i still have all of it. This is worth the money .</li>
    <li> It created long thick amazing looking eyelashes alright BUT after about 3 hours it begins to melt. I love how it looks when it first goes on so I continue to use it every morning with different primers and tricks to get it to stay but it just won&#x27;t. I just have to keep checking through my work day and keep tissuing it off my skin. I am a hairstylist and owner of a company and it just freaks me out to have my makeup not perfectly on through the day. I will use this up because I paid so much money but unless I find a good way to keep it on I won&#x27;t be buying it again which is too bad!</li>
    <li> So I heard about this stuff on a blog and how fabulous it was.  I decided that I would try it out! Well, my teen daughter was so impressed that she actually stole it from me and used it, which is funny because she is so anal about NOT sharing make-up with anyone (which is a good thing)!! I never thought she would ever use mine or like it! BUT I was WRONG!!! We both LOVE IT! I read the other reviews and they talked about how hard it was to remove. Nor my daughter or I found it difficult to remove.  It makes your eyelashes look amazing! I actually bought two others, one to replace mine that my daughter stole and another one for a friend of mine for her birthday.  If you want amazing and fabulous looking eyelashes then this is the mascara for you!!! I am hooked on the product, but not the price.  I wish it was a little cheaper! I only use it on special occasions when I want my eyelashes to be \\&quot;WOW\\&quot;!!! I give it 5 stars and so does my daughter!!!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best mascara i have EVER used. I am a very picky person when it comes to mascaras, if one doesn&#x27;t do the trick, I will layer different kinds on top of one another. Eventually I got tired of doing that. I wanted something to make my lashes thick, long, spread out evenly and curl beautifully. This mascara doesn&#x27;t even need a 3rd coat in my opinion. It has an amazing brush that doesn&#x27;t get too goopy at the tips, and applies a very even amount to every lash. even sometimes forgetting to curl my lashes before hand, it still never fails me to make my lashes perfect! The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this 5 stars is because I have found, with my second tube, that the formula does get dry pretty quick, and the wand is sometimes difficult to twist shut after a while. Please try this, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> This mascara is the BEST I have ever tried, prior to the Bad Gal that Benefit makes. I have tried every mascara out there. This one stays put, no smudges, flaking and my lashes look full and fabulous!!! I recommend it to everyone I meet. Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I received this mascara as a gift from Sephora for my birthday. I received the small sample size, and while the brush works well, I find that the formula is not as remarkable as they say it is. It&#x27;s average. I agree that Covergirl mascara works about the same and is reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> This product makes my lashes so long they touch my eyeglass lenses! Look is a bit on the spidery side, would prefer more thickness. very waterproof.</li>
    <li> Oh baby it&#x27;s awsome got a lot of compliment s one this product,comes of easily so you do have to worry about delicate eye area</li>
    <li> I had to click one star--that&#x27;s all it&#x27;s worth.  This item is a definite knock off--I brought it to Sephora where I always purchase my They&#x27;re Real Mascara, and the sales person agreed it was definitely not the same mascara.  I wouldn&#x27;t use anything on my eyes that is questionable, at best, so I&#x27;m throwing this out and contacting the seller requesting a refund.</li>
    <li> One tube of this mascara lasts me 2-3 months and that&#x27;s applying it about 5 times per week. It, by far, gives me the longest lashes with the least amount of clumps. In each area that we women tend to look for with mascara: length, fullness, clumping, lasting, etc. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s not the best in every area, but for the value and the combination of all that it does- it&#x27;s worth it. It has a great black color, covers well, and makes my lashes look thicker too. It&#x27;s also long lasting, sometimes even a bit hard to take off with make-up remover, but at least I know it will stay all day!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite mascera and it really doesn&#x27;t compare to the others on the market. I doesn&#x27;t make my eyes water, it makes my lashes really long and full, also has a great applicator which makes applying it easy. I would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have long beautiful eyelashes. And not only enough volume. Usually have no problems with mascara. But its mascara nothing. Glued, no separation or similarity in size. Disappointing.</li>
    <li> There real mascara is an awesome product. It looks just like I have false eyelashes. I am going to buy more as gifts for my friends. The shipping was fast too.</li>
    <li> Good:  Stays on all day, does not fade.  Still looks great by the end of the evening.  Made my lashes much longer and fuller. I was able to stop wearing eyeliner and just use this mascara&lt;br /&gt;Not so good: Very thick so you have to use care applying it or it will get on your lash line and look like spotty eyeliner.  Very hard to remove. Even after using eye makeup remover cream and washing my face, I still had a \\&quot;raccoon\\&quot; look and had to use more eye makeup remover.  Then the next morning, there was still a slight residue that I had to remove before I could reapply.&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy this again, yes!  I do recommend it because of its staying power and the way it really thickens and lengthens my lashes.  I have never been able to find a mascara that really works until now.</li>
    <li> I am happy to report that this mascara does deliver . It  did extend my lashes and it has a nice consistency not too goopy and the brush separates nicely</li>
    <li> I just got my mascara ,I put it on and loved it .I have having problems with alot of brands my eyes have been super sensitive .I can usually tell within minutes if it will bother me .This did not I have worn it all day...</li>
    <li> Simply the best mascara! Extends my tiny, thin, blonde lashes like a dream/ I actually like putting on makeup now!!!  Downside... Spendy and takes work to get off ~ eye makeup remover is a must</li>
    <li> I have short, straight lashes and this stuff makes them appear thick, long, and best of all curled.  It lasts all day.  The tube lasted me at least twice as long as the less expensive brands so the cost really isn&#x27;t that bad.</li>
    <li> Was amazed by the versatility of the brush. It says to use horizantally and vertically which I was skeptical at first (because of clumping) but it worked out pretty well! Seems to stay on all day without it weathering throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;Def worth the price</li>
    <li> This mascara is so perfect!! easy to use, easy to remove and really makes a big difference when you are wearing it!</li>
    <li> I am a sucker for trying new mascaras. I wanted to so love this mascara. I received it as a free sample, and I am glad because I will not be purchasing myself. It made my lashes look like tarantula eyes! I even keep trying it thinking, oh well maybe I put to much or didn&#x27;t do it right. I will say that the tip of the wand is very nice though, it really helps get those inner corner lashes plus you can use it vetically to help get lashes you&#x27;ve missed. I know a lot of people love this stuff, but I am not one of them. It also made my lashes stick together too, which made them just look like spiky hard long sticks! It does work better if you apply a primer first.</li>
    <li> Got this in a sample bag and loved it so I ordered it!! Looks like false lashes, people always ask me what kind of mascara I use!</li>
    <li> This mascara is wonderful. It doesn&#x27;t run if it gets wet. My lashes look longer and I don&#x27;t have to use any eyeliner at all.</li>
    <li> The vendor I bought this from promised me things that did not happen.  The stuff he sent me looked like a made-in-china knockof...It&#x27;s not the real stuff that is made by Benefit</li>
    <li> So, no one has asked me if &amp;#34;they&#x27;re real&amp;#34;, but I can definitely tell a difference from using this than using my regular (and much less expensive) mascara.  So, the positives - there IS a difference (not a dramatic one, but definite improvement) and it stays on.  Negatives - it stays on - like, seriously, STAYS ON and takes some work to remove.  Also, it&#x27;s a little pricey.  But still cheaper than getting eyelash extensions and much less time consuming. :)</li>
    <li> I bought this from sephora and it is pretty clumpy. i will not buy again. My favorite is Lash Blast in the orange tube by cover girl.</li>
    <li> It is very watery and leaves black lash marks on your lids.  I bought 2 and would love to return the other.  GRRRRRR!</li>
    <li> Except I&#x27;m not a huge fan of waterproof mascara, otherwise I&#x27;d have given it a 5 start.  It does go one nice and doesn&#x27;t clump and doesn&#x27;t leave fibers, but it is a little difficult to get off even with my normal makeup remover.  Just is a little hard on my very blond eyelashes.  I had to get this because amazon was out of my normal Fairy Drops but it works well.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works!! I have long eyelashes to begin with, but it makes them even longer. I love the way the brush is made at the tip....that really helps add length. It takes some effort to remove this mascara....it&#x27;s almost waterproof.....but it doesn&#x27;t run with regular everyday wear. I will purchase this product again. If you like this but want one that is easier to remove try Benefit Cosmetic&#x27;s BadGal Lash Mascara. I love that stuff too!</li>
    <li> I love this mascara after using it for the first time I have recommended this to everyone I actually buy it for a girl I work with as well</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t overly impressed with this mascara.  I was hoping that it would work better than my go-to I&#x27;ve been using the past couple years, but did a side by side comparison and saw no difference.  It is also much harder to remove than my other mascara.  For some that might be ideal, but for me, having to wash my eyes twice is not ideal at all.  Overall, I&#x27;m not impressed.  What was nice about it was that it didn&#x27;t flake during the day (neither does the tarte stuff i use).  So overall this is a decent mascara, but it isn&#x27;t so impressive that i will switch.</li>
    <li> I bought this after a friend said it was the best..and now I love it. It really does build up nicely and looks like falsies is you build it up enough. You can apply as little or as much as you like.</li>
    <li> I wont ever buy another kind of mascara again. My mom got me hooked on this one.&lt;br /&gt;She has thin eyelashes and it made hers look amazing so I tried it.&lt;br /&gt;I have lots of them so my issue is usually that mascara is too thin so the end up clumped and sticking together.&lt;br /&gt;This mascara is thick. So if you know what you are doing you can get some very amazing looking lashes.&lt;br /&gt;Be warned though - this stuff stays on. You need serious work or good eye makeup remover to get off.&lt;br /&gt;Buy it, its pricey but totally worth it. You will not regret it.</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping it would live up to the reviews and transform my short lashes into what they claim, \\&quot;the look of false eyelashes\\&quot;. Well sad to say it did not. It is an ok mascara, but not any better than my $5-$7 mascara. I would not buy it again. Very sticky...definitly must have a mascara remover!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried every mascara there is - looking for the perfect blend of lengthen-er and thickener.  Love the way it goes on, love the way it stays on...and love the brush.</li>
    <li> I love the effect of the mascara. I didn&#x27;t have to put a lot of get a great lengthening and thickening effect. It&#x27;s just beautiful. However, I do find that they smudge quite easily.</li>
    <li> I have to give this 0 stars because the mascara was unusable. It was sticky and stringy, so we through it away chalking it up to not buying mascara online. The one star rating was a requirement for submitting</li>
    <li> This s by far the best mascara on the market...and believe me I&#x27;ve had my far share.  It&#x27;s a little pricey...but we&#x27;ll worth the money!!!  I have very short and sparse lashes and this is the only mascara that really brings them out.  So much so they look fake!  This product is the real deal!</li>
    <li> Worth every penny! I have tried countless drugstore &amp; high end mascaras, none worked like this. Typically I would spend close to 40 minutes applying at least three different kinds of mascara, never to end up feeling satisfied with my stubborn lashes. Now, 4-5 coats (I like them LONG) of &amp;#34;Yes, They&#x27;re Real&amp;#34; &amp; I am ready to go. Will definitely repurchase. GREAT SELLER, SUPER FAST SHIPPING, EXCELLENT PRODUCT!!</li>
    <li> I love the jet black mascara. It leaves your eye lashes longer and makes it appear more full. It&#x27;s much more noticeable then some of the drug store brands. I think the brush is very effective in separating the lashes but when you apply the mascara and go over the lashes a few times it does start to clump together and makes it appear messy. I like to have clean and separate lashes. Aside from that disadvantage I would recommend this product to my friends. I hope removing the mascara is easy because this is the 1st time I am using the product.</li>
    <li> This mascara is the best I&#x27;ve used, hands down. The application wand is made to really help lengthen and separate lashes. I use over an eyelash primer, no smudge, melts, flakes!</li>
    <li> I wish it come in waterproof too!  No clumping or smearing.  Best I have found.  Washes off easily - no scrubbing required~!</li>
    <li> This has a unique tip that almost &amp;#34;reaches&amp;#34; out and coats enter and outer lashes!!  It never clumps, glides on smoothly and is one of the best mascaras that I have every used!!  It also is easily removed which is a big, big plus - but does not smug!!  Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t even feel as though I bought the same mascara as other reviewers. The actual mascara was just okay-it did not make my lashes look spectacular, curled, more voluminous, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest problem was removing the mascara. This is super hard to remove! I had to use 3 makeup removers to get it off. I also jumped in the shower once without removing it first-I looked like an extra in a horror movie and had to scrub my skin to get it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to keep searching for the perfect mascara.</li>
    <li> I like this mascara, it lengthens my lashes, it doesn&#x27;t flake off and it doesn&#x27;t clump up and get gunky.</li>
    <li> I bought this after a friend said it was the best..and now I love it. I even did not take it off last night and this morning, it&#x27;s like I just put it on... none under the bottom lids like others do if you sleep in it and I dont&#x27;  have any trouble putting it on my bottom lashes at all.... I read some people do, but it&#x27;s easier to use than any others I&#x27;ve had... so glad I bought it.  BobbieB</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always looking for a great mascara because my lashes are so light in color and thin.  This product is ok, but nothing spectacular.  I use it after I use another brand, and together it&#x27;s ok.  I do believe this mascara doesn&#x27;t rub off as easily as other brands and I do like the brush and it doesn&#x27;t clump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I found the best way to use this is by putting on two applications of Smashbox Full Exposure then two applications of Real Benefit mascara.  Real Benefit does add to the first applications and I believe significantly helps to decrease smudging.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;re all always looking for the best cosmetic for us.  This mascara is great.  The brush makes a lot of difference, and the mascara itself stays on great!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Do not buy this it is a fake. It isn&#x27;t the real thing and it is a set up to get your money. I had to learn the hard way.</li>
    <li> I wish so much didn&#x27;t come out on the brush, but aside from that this is the best mascara I have ever had. It creates length and volume with minimal clumping. Clumps that do occur are eaisily removed with an eyelash brush. A bit pricey, but the product is totally worth it.</li>
    <li> This is actually the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever owned.&lt;br /&gt;I thought it was hyped up, as most designer mascaras are, and didnt bother to buy it when it first came out.&lt;br /&gt;It was given to me as a gift last year though and it is BY FAR the best I&#x27;ve ever used!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to every makeup user I know now. It really enhances your lashes and since you only need one coat its absolutely perfect for everyday wear.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara! It definitely lengthens. My only complaint is that it&#x27;s terribly hard to remove. Even after using make up remover face wash, it still sticks to my lashes. I have to use make up remover pads each time I take it off even after washing my face. But! With that being said, I will continue to by this mascara because it works so well.</li>
    <li> I purchased this mascara as a sample from Ulta in which the packaging boasted all of this products amazing benefits. All of the claims were false I could have gotten similar results from a drug store mascara. For starters, I do have longer eyelashes so I am usually looking for a mascara that provides volume. This mascara does not offer volume at all and instead of offering more length separated my lashes so that it looked like I had spider legs on my eyes - not a good look. Also the mascara flakes and smears over the course of the day. Another major downfall of this product was the fact that after curling my eyelashes it actually ended up straightening them (this is never an issue as I don&#x27;t have straight eyelashes to start with!) It does offer a nice deep black color but that&#x27;s about the only perk. Overall, a waste of time and money.... back to the drawing board.</li>
    <li> definately did not wow my lashes out to new lengths or thickness... but is ok compared to other quality mascaras</li>
    <li> This Product is the BEST!!! every woman should have, try this it makes your eyelashes longer I know mine are short</li>
    <li> i have used this mascara for a few years and love it even though it is a &amp;#34;little bit&amp;#34; pricey.  i thought i could save a few dollars and by online, mascara that came was gloppy and unusable.  to make matters worse...i was on a business trip when this was discovered.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after asking someone if they had lash extensions.  I wanted the affect of long lashes without the expense. Unfortunately this mascara didn&#x27;t have the same effect on me.  Maybe it is old inventory, but it is very clumpy and I spend more time trying to unclump my lashes and they don&#x27;t appear any longer than using Great Lash Mascara by Maybelline which costs a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara! The applicator has a really fine brush which really allows you to get every lash and the mascara doesn&#x27;t clump. Your lashes are really defined and the mascara doesn&#x27;t flake off during the course of a day. My only complaint (and it is minor) is that when you first open a tube the brush comes out with too much mascara on it for the first week or so of use, so you have to swipe it on a tissue to get the excess off.</li>
    <li> This was disappointing - doesn&#x27;t look any different than my regular mascara.  This isn&#x27;t waterproof, is hard to remove and doesn&#x27;t make your lashes look longer.  For my money, I&#x27;ll continue to buy Estee Lauder&#x27;s waterproof mascara - always looks great and doesn&#x27;t run.</li>
    <li> Mascaras for me don&#x27;t last long. I usually look like a raccoon by midday, and that&#x27;s without any strenuous activity. I&#x27;ve tried just about every brand and style of mascara, \\&quot;long-wearing\\&quot; and \\&quot;waterproof\\&quot;, you name it that has existed without any difference. I finally asked someone at the department store what she would recommend, and she suggested this product. Now admittedly, I was skeptical as she looked like a spider lady with her excessive application of the product, but I was willing to give it a try. This is the product I was looking for. I can go through my entire work day without much if any wear. I have done a full workout without the product wearing off, I have even cried and not had streaks down my face. If you need something that lasts, this might be what you need. I myself don&#x27;t have a problem taking the product off that others have. I use Almay products and I don&#x27;t have to rub to remove the mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, to address what other people have said about the spider leg effect, I can only say it might be the way you apply it. I don&#x27;t apply a lot, 2 quick coats, and still get the color, length and look I like for my eyes. I wouldn&#x27;t say my lashes look like the picture on the box, but then again, NO product I&#x27;ve ever used has accomplished that. But they look full and long enough. I&#x27;m not a big fan of the style of brush this mascara uses, but it seems to do the trick without huge clumps. Again, the way you apply the product might have something to do with the end result. If like me you need something that is long lasting, I would suggest this product. Expensive, but worth it.</li>
    <li> I have used this brand of mascara for a very long time and normally purchase it directly from Sephora. When I saw the price of 14.99 here I couldn&#x27;t pass it up however I regret buying it. When I received the mascara I noticed a few key things: the color of the logo was different than normal, the mascara itself smelled off, the label on the bottom was different and the wand was extremely rubbery (unlike the normal wand).  It doesn&#x27;t have the same coverage as normal; it clumps, you can&#x27;t layer it, and it leaves my lashes looking thin. I now have two of them that I can&#x27;t even use! I&#x27;d recommend purchasing this product directly from a trusted store, not here.</li>
    <li> This is a great mascara and lasts a long time.  This is the only mascara that I have repeatedly bought.  I was always going from one to another hoping to find this one.  This is the one!</li>
    <li> I can say that it is not the same quality of product that I get when I buy it at Sephora or Ulta.  It is okay but I am only going to use it if I run out of the good one and need something fast.</li>
    <li> I was such a skeptic that a great mascara brush existed out there. They&#x27;re always either too short and spiky or they make the mascara clumpy, or the brush is too long... you get the idea. THIS MASCARA IS THE REAL DEAL. You will kick yourself for not having tried it sooner! I&#x27;m a believer again.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome mascara!! Did not fully understand the free $300 gift for a rating of 5 stars note that was enclosed inside the package but neverless the product it self was great.!!</li>
    <li> I love this mascara! Received a trial size as a promotion and decided to fork out the money for a large size. I have thin, short-ish lashes and this mascara is amazing...adds some curl, length and volume without being clumpy. Item shipped super fast with no issues. Would definitely buy again. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I have been using the same Mascara for about 8 years now and wanted to try something new. So glad I found this product!! I take a lot of pride in my eyelashes and this mascara truly lives up to my expectations!!</li>
    <li> it clumps and not easy to appy. not a good buy for the money. sorry -- i am running out of words...</li>
    <li> This product is a knock off! The real mascara is amazing. Save yourself the trouble and just order from sephora.</li>
    <li> I went into a cosmetic store and asked for the best mascara and was given They&#x27;re real.  The beauty consultant was wearing it and said she absolutely loved it.  I told her I did not like it the first time I tried it which was a year ago, but decided to try it again based upon her recommendation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results are the same....it clumps the lashes together, (I think to add the volume) but it just ends up being fat clumps, not much length to speak of.  hroughout the day I have droppings under my eyes.  Its so funny that it comes up a little during the day and but when trying to get it off at night, it is so hard to remove no matter what the remover used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others may like this mascara, but I just hate it.</li>
    <li> It has plenty of lenghtening fibers but the product is not easy to apply. It needs several coats and then the lashes easily stick in different directions.</li>
    <li> I was given a sample of this mascara at Sephora and I absolutely loved it.  I bought a full-sized one right away and it is my favorite mascara.  It makes them longer and doesn&#x27;t clump or smear.</li>
    <li> the seal broke almost immediately. if i ever want to use it, i have to open it, and then reclose the lid as tight as possible, and then open it again...and that doesn&#x27;t always work. but anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s a really good product if you&#x27;re more focused on length than volume. personally, i&#x27;ve used some drugstore brands that give me better volume, but maybe i should take more time when applying this mascara. it&#x27;s good quality and has an awesome wand, but i&#x27;m not entirely convinced it was worth the $30 i dropped for such high ratings. not entirely sure if i&#x27;ll repurchase this whenever it runs out.</li>
    <li> I received the mascara in a very timely manner.  Thank you!  This mascara is a bit&lt;br /&gt;different in that the application is somewhat tricky, but following some practice, it&lt;br /&gt;becomes easier to apply.  It goes on thicker than other mascaras I have used...so&lt;br /&gt;a stroke and hold application is working well for me. My lashes truly seem to&lt;br /&gt;appear...unreal.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I want to have fuller lashes with out the time (or desire) to apply false lashes.&lt;br /&gt;The product does live up to it&#x27;s hype, my lashes looked longer and that was with only 2 coats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons for me:&lt;br /&gt;- Very difficult to remove with eye make up remover.  I had to nearly scrub my eye lids to remove the product and my eyes were irritated from afterwards.  It took 2 eye make up remover applications and facial make up remover before the cloths came back clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Dries very quickly.  I had to put the 2 coats on right away vs. each eye/lower lid at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise I would recommend this mascara but have an industrial strength eye make up remover handy!</li>
    <li> I wanted this mascara for a while.  Extremely disappointed in this product.  The formulas is very thin and really did not perform to its hype.  My lashes were very spidery and reduced to about 7 pointy not very long or thick lashes.  I am not a big fan of Benefit but was willing to try this mascara and be surprised.  It didn&#x27;t happen for me.</li>
    <li> I loved this product when I first applied it however it flakes very quickly and because I wear contacts this was a problem for me .</li>
    <li> Other mascaras have given me long, thick lashes but after about four hours I&#x27;m ready to wash my eyes out.  I can wear They&#x27;re Real! Mascara all day without it irritating my eyes.  And my eye lashes look fabulous.  I remove my eye make up with water proof eye make up remover and this comes off easily.  Better than most.</li>
    <li> This mascara is perfect for people who want long lashes. It doesn&#x27;t really do much for volume because if you apply too much, you WILL start to get clumps. So again, if you want long lashes, get this mascara. Not the mascara wand isn&#x27;t really that practical fr a wet formula. The bristles are far apart so it doesn&#x27;t evenly apply the product. All in all, this mascara is great for length but not so much for volume.</li>
    <li> This product gives you length and volume, with out compromising the flexibility of the eyelashes. soooo YOU CAN STILL CURL YOUR EYELASHES after using! I&#x27;ve tried other fiberwig mascaras ans this is the best! I won&#x27;t swith ever again!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I&#x27;m a sucker for great advertising. \\&quot;They&#x27;re Real!\\&quot; These promised bold, voluptuous, flake-free lashes that were supposed to be so utterly amazing, one might believe you had false lashes on. I have thin, delicate lashes and what I was looking for was something that could basically stop traffic. The result: nice length, no where near plump, vavoom volume, a bit of flakiness after applying the second layer. I did better with my trusty Loreal Voluminous False Lashes Mascara at half the price. Thanks, I loved the wand, but not the effect I was searching for. I&#x27;ll be returning \\&quot;They&#x27;re Real.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> This is hands down the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used. It thickens, lengthens, and darkens like crazy. The formula itself is great, I have zero complaints about that - but the brush is awful. It&#x27;s thin and spiky and not nearly bristly enough to separate and \\&quot;fluff\\&quot; your lashes. Using the brush that comes with this mascara results in a few stuck together clumps of spidery lashes. I cleaned off an old brush from a Covergirl mascara and I use it after the They&#x27;re Real, before the mascara dries, and the results are fantastic. It&#x27;s kind of a pain to have to carry 2 mascaras around, but this stuff works so well that it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I like this mascara but dont love it.  When I opened the tube and pulled out the wand the mascara stretched like melted cheese on a pizza slice.  I think its a messy mascara and probably wont buy it again.  I have bought Too Faced Lash Injection and LashGASM.  I prefer those over this one because they go on much cleaner and still give your lashes a very full look.  My favorite mascara is Too Faced Lash Injection of all the mascaras I&#x27;ve ever tried in my 43 year old life.  Second is Maybelline GreatLash for something that works well for little money.</li>
    <li> This mascara can be a little tricky...it&#x27;s so thick that you have to be very careful applying it. comparable to drugstore brands</li>
    <li> I use this mascara daily since the first week it came out.&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s: EXCELLENT - I am talking astonishing - ability to truly lift, separate and give eyelashes a volume and length I&#x27;ve never gotten from other beauty products. I have been asked MORE times than I can count if my eyelashes are real or fake!! ☺ I follow directions to a T.  It def. maximizes the amazing &amp; beautiful effect the mascara promotes. I also use eye bright, lemon aid and the new under eye concealer (not erase paste). However your results may not be immediately similar to mine as I am practiced / skilled in applying all facial makeup and esp the eyes. I have read every how-to, practiced for years and years and learned tips/tricks and application methods from pro artists. I love doing makeup, especially with quality makeup and application tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my advice to buy this Only CON: Runs out too quickly and if tube is low, you&#x27;re application (at least in my time using this) will be uneven, clumpy and in general not work well. Buy it today! Now which of you beauty guru ladies can name a great full coverage foundation for acne scarred skin, etc..? Thanks for reading my novel.</li>
    <li> This mascara didn&#x27;t really do it for me. The description made it seem like it would definitely boost my lashes like no other mascara has! I was disappointed to find that it did not. It went on nice and easy, and did enhance my lashes (as any mascara would). However, it didn&#x27;t make them longer and fuller as promised. I did about 4 applications of it and it did make a difference but I&#x27;ve found other mascaras that do in 1 application what this did in 4. This just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> After reading many positiive reviews I ordered the most expensive mascara I ever ordered. It is so messy!!!! You have to fan your lashes for it to set for several minutes and still I get black smudges. I use a very good eye makeup remover and still it doesnt all come off and I get flaking thru the day. Also, the cap broke. The part glued to the wand came off. What a waste of $24!!!!</li>
    <li> Ladies if you are looking for a mascara that makes a statement this is it!  I get many peopple who ask me if I have eye-lash extensions in and I fill them in on my secret.  My lashes are extra long and full!  Thete is a ideo on u tube that shows you have to apply tis band of mascara and it is very helpful to give your lashes the extra WOW facotr!  Seller sipped item quickly</li>
    <li> Received a sample in MyGlamBag and had to order the full sized product. I wish they had a waterproof option, but this mascara works miracles. Way better price found on Amazon.com then on the manufacturers website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used daily</li>
    <li> I really like this mascara!  My eyes are sensitive to certain types of mascara and this one works great for me.  It makes my lashes look fuller and longer than they actually are and doesn&#x27;t flake or clump.</li>
    <li> It exstends your lashes to the fullest, don&#x27;t leave home without it.  I am hooked.  It is hard to remove, even though I am black (African) it leaves the racoon look when trying to remove it.  I found a good face cleanser that removes it.  This is a great product and it arrived a day earlier than exspected.</li>
    <li> I like the mascara in general - I love the brush- full and rich - application makes easy and fast - but one super bad point- does not dry on your lashes fast ! . The day I received my new mascara After I finished my makeup routine  in about 5 min I came out of bathroom and my hubby gave me a hug  - and all my mascara  was all over my face and his sweater- It is unbelievable to stay  on and do not get dry in such long period of time - .  I can not touch up eyeshadows if mascara still wet- it is all over on the lid -  .  I do not like to pay attention to this -  in the morning then each second counts- it is very annoying .</li>
    <li> Makes my lashes super long and luxurious. I absolutely love it. One drawback -- it can be difficult to remove but a little eye cream under my eyes always does the trick. Totally worth it!</li>
    <li> it stays on all day, does not flake into my eyes.  it makes me look like i have extensions on.  i can wear it even without eyelash primer.</li>
    <li> I have 10 mascara&#x27;s in my makeup drawer at any time, always on the quest for the perfect one.  I was given a sample of this at a fashion show and was hooked!</li>
    <li> This mascara didn&#x27;t work for me like it seems to for everyone else. Mostly it just made my lashes goopy and stick together. I had to use another (less expensive) mascara on top of it to separate my lashes and add volume. Waste of money - I&#x27;ll stick with the grocery store brands that I like.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara. It really does build up nicely and looks like falsies is you build it up enough. You can apply as little or as much as you like. I like the fact that I can apply a little for day wear or more for dramatic nighttime wear. Stays on well also. No clumping, smearing or flaking. The end brush is the key to building up lashes. Will definately buy more!!</li>
    <li> I tried this after Emily Maynard tweeted about it and because I have really thin, short, almost non-existent lashes. The first time I put it on, my lashes looked like they weren&#x27;t even mine! I seriously will never go back to another mascara. Talk about a miracle!&lt;br /&gt;I use Mavala Double Lash at night which is another amazing product. Goes great with this and thickens my lashes overnight. If I need a cheaper/waterproof alternative, I use Maybelline Falsies.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a mascara junkie and am always on the edge of my seat for the next great thing.  I use latisse so my lashes are decently long, but I need volume and I love dramatic lashes.  This mascara is DARK, gives volume, length and separates.  Separating is probably the most note-worthy aspect for me because I&#x27;ve tried many mascaras that create volume, but also clump your lashes together.  This gives me a million BIG, long, dark lashes that actually do look like false eyelashes!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is interesting and very rough because it actually functions like a metal lash comb, rather than the typical flexible brush, so be careful not to poke your eye.  This outperforms all of the top rated mascaras, IMO, and I&#x27;ve tried almost all including Dior, YSL, Tarte, Lancome, etc.  I usually have a problem with mascaras smudging on the top of my eye (below my eyebrows) but that&#x27;s not a problem with this one.</li>
    <li> Love the results from using this mascara, great coverage and color.Absolutely no smudging below the eye, even with full makeup foundation under the eye. Truly waterproof and smudgeproof. I would give it 5 stars but I have tried 3 different make-up removers, eye makeup removers and regular removers, but it is extremely hard to remove. I hate to rub my already sparse lashes too much for fear of losing what lashes I still have. That said, this is the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used. I will keep on trying other eye makeup removers until I find one that works for this mascara.</li>
    <li> I will start by saying that I have very sensitive eyes. I had gone years without wearing mascara because it seemed that everything I tried made my eyes burn and water. Someone gave me a bottle of this as a gift and now I am hooked. It does not irritate my eyes at all. It also makes my lashes look longer and fuller and I would almost swear that they have gotten stronger and healthier over time! If they ever stop making this product I would be lost. It has become a staple in my make-up bag.</li>
    <li> I received the product extremely fast. It was exactly as described and it works GREAT! It separates my eye lashes, makes them longer and they look thicker. Love it!!</li>
    <li> These really do enhance my lashes length and thickness wise, and I was asked by friends if I had falsies on. The -1 star is because like most mascaras, even when you are careful not to meddle with them, and are careful to screw the top on tight, the impact and effect seem to lessen each time you use it, so that after a few weeks it doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well, and gets clumpy.  This one more so than others, it seemed, so i was discouraged but will try one more in case I got a &#x27;bad&#x27; one or something.</li>
    <li> I love the way the product glides on my eyelash. And, love the different bristles on the brush to get max coverage even on the little lashes. Thank you for the fast and speedy delivery. :-)</li>
    <li> Pulled it out of the mailing envelope and put it on one eye.&lt;br /&gt;Yes I can see a difference.  Then I read the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;Now I can&#x27;t wait to put it on correctly tomorrow....they already&lt;br /&gt;look longer when I just did it really quick.&lt;br /&gt;Get seller too...quick delivery.</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara I have ever used by FAR. Over the span of my life I&#x27;ve bought most of what the drug store carries, many department store brands and some of the luxury brands. Nothing else comes close to this.</li>
    <li> I actually thought a girl from work wore false eyelashes, until she told me it was this mascara from that point I was sold. I am very pleased with the mascara, it stays with me all day, now I wish I could find an eyeliner equally as good .</li>
    <li> I received a sample tube of Theyr&#x27;e Real! mascara on a recent visit to Sephora. I was not looking for a mascara and figured it would be similar to all the other samples I&#x27;ve tried and saved for travel in the past.  I always wear mascara and I&#x27;m happy to try different brands, but the truth is that most seem very similar, with a few doing a much poorer, not better job than the rest. When I put They&#x27;re Real! on for the first time I was actually very surprised that I thought I noticed a difference. I was skeptical of my own judgment because I know none of the others really were different, especially when I later did a side by side comparison.  This one made my lashes really pop out and they had an obvious curl to them (I never take the time to use a curling wand). I decided to try my current mascara, Maybelline Colossal Volume (yellow tube) mascara on my other eye immediately to see if I was imagining the difference or not.  The difference was clear once I tried my old brand, in fact it was different enough that I put a coat of They&#x27;re Real! on top of my other eye so I didn&#x27;t look unbalanced. I then decided to take a week and compare it to a few other brands I had on hand: Loreal Voluminous, CoverGirl Lash Blast (orange tube), Maybelline The Falsies volume express (purple tube). In each case I put the They&#x27;re Real! on my left eye (the one that I find harder to do, just to make sure any difference wasn&#x27;t due to an advantage I had in application) and my old brand on my right eye.  In every case, the difference was obvious.  The They&#x27;re Real! eye lashes looked a bit glossier, were longer, and just thicker and more noticeable. They were also the only ones that had a curl to them.  Finally, I noticed that they were so dark near the base of the lash that it gave the appearance that I had a bit of extra liner on. I liked that.  I then started looking at other reviews to see what other folks said. I was so excited, I wondered why I hadn&#x27;t heard of these before. I guess it&#x27;s just because I usually get the drug store brand or stop by the Clinique or Prescriptives  counter.  I saw one reviewer who said that Cover Girl had a mascara that she thought did just as well. I know that would be cheaper so I actually went out and bought a tube of it to do a comparision...I figured the $7 spent one time would be worth it if I found out it would be as good. The one that was mentioned was Cover Girl lashblast fusion in a purple tube. I was excited to try this one.  I do think it is a nice mascara and it did an excellent job separating my lashes...really the best one at that. However, it definitely did not make my lashes as thick or noticeable as the They&#x27;re Real! mascara. I will definitely be making this my new mascara, despite it being pricier than my older brands. It&#x27;s not the one to use if you want a more natural look (I think the CoverGirl Lash Blast is a nice one for that), but if you want your eyes to really \\&quot;pop\\&quot;, it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever tried. So glad I got that sample!</li>
    <li> Love it!  Shipped to me quickly and packaged well.  I&#x27;ve used this product many times before and reorder often!  It really is a great product.</li>
    <li> ISO the perfect mascara!  I use to use Diorbut got bored, I sometimes use Buxum, but that seems to dry out in the tube quickly. I like the idea of Blinc, but that doesn&#x27;t volumize at all.  This product so far has met my expectations. It is dark ,glossy, &amp;  volumizing. I am happy and will likely repurchase.</li>
    <li> I typically don&#x27;t find high end mascara any different from Covergirl lashblast, but this stuff is different. I ran out and switched back to lashblast last week, and have felt like I look sick ever since. It&#x27;s not quite the look of false lashes, but it&#x27;s definitely worth a few extra bucks.</li>
    <li> My friend is wearing this mascara and her eyes are beautiful.  i cant not believe how full and long her lashes are.  can not wait to use this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this after seeing rave reviews on TV.  Honestly, it&#x27;s just like any other mascara I&#x27;ve used.  I do like that it doesn&#x27;t flake off or cause any eye sensitivity.  It is nice and dark, but does clump up a bit when I&#x27;m applying it.</li>
    <li> Hate it, worst almost ever. Don&#x27;t waste your money...get drugstore brand, much better then this any day. Of the week</li>
    <li> They do not give you that super fake look like on commercials.. but for a tube of mascara, it definitely beats any other brand I have tried! Definitely sticking with this one for awhile!</li>
    <li> Unbelievable mascara! It will need to be washed off daily as it clumps. However, this mascara does some miracle work on your lashes. You would almost think they are fake, they look so perfect.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife just because I had heard good things about it.  She seems to love it.  I can personally tell that her lashes appear larger than with her previous mascara.  Her only complaint is that it&#x27;s difficult to remove.  I guess that can be both good &amp; bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit (6/5/13): I guess my wife just had to get used to the liner, because now she says that it&#x27;s actually easier to remove than her other liners.  She also mentioned that she likes how long and well it stays on.</li>
    <li> It does what name says. It made my lash thicker and longer. My mother thought I was wearing false eyelashes!!!</li>
    <li> WOW!  LOVE this stuff!  This gives my aging lashes the look of thick long luscious lashes...love it! worth the money for me!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best mascaras I&#x27;ve tried for separating and lengthening my lashes (would be the best if it wasn&#x27;t for the price). The wand is designed specifically to coat every single lash and lengthen it. My lashes have definitely been more than twice as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if you prefer voluminous lashes, this won&#x27;t be the best product for you. It&#x27;s great for achieving a natural look for the daytime. If you&#x27;re aiming for full, glamorous lashes, however, this product would only do half the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another downside is that the formula can make your lashes stiff. If you want to apply another coat later the day, it can be hard to avoid clumping. Also, I&#x27;ve had small issues with smudging under my eyes, so I&#x27;d usually need to check every few hours to wipe away the black smudges on my eye bags. However, I&#x27;ve given up on finding mascaras that don&#x27;t result in any under-eye smudging...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, this is a great lengthening mascara for separating your lashes and making your eyes appear bigger while still looking natural for the daytime. Whether or not it&#x27;s worth the price, however, depends on whether you prefer longer or fuller lashes.</li>
    <li> I am addicted to this mascara..works like it says do not have to use much to get the lashes you want.</li>
    <li> This mascara was a birthday gift for my daughter, who only uses Benefit &amp;#34;They&#x27;re Real&amp;#34; mascara. It&#x27;s awful! The consistency is like honey, and it leaves a thick, sticky residue on her lashes that will not dry and is so tacky her lashes stick together. We have never had a problem with this product when purchased through stores like Ulta, but this item was either not stored correctly, or is very old. Very disappointed in the quality of this item.</li>
    <li> WASTE OF MONEY!I AM VERY UPSET I SPENT THIS KIND OF MONEY ON A PRODUCT THAT WAS WORTH NO MORE THAN A $3 MASCARA!!</li>
    <li> I bought at Ulta. I have thin med-long brown lashes and was looking for something to bring out the length and separate for fullness. I tried They&#x27;re Real, BAD Gal (both Benefit), Loreal Voluminous Waterproof, and Lancôme Hypnose waterproof. Hopefully the range of products is helpful :)&lt;br /&gt;TR-I didn&#x27;t hate it, but I didn&#x27;t love it.&lt;br /&gt;pros-Black was rich, dried super fast (good if you curl), washed off easily (not waterproof), gives a fake lash look in a good way (thick)&lt;br /&gt;cons-Clumpy, but that&#x27;s what makes it thickening. These are tiny chunks left on the lashes that some chicks won&#x27;t mind, but I prefer totally smooth/separated. Dries so fast that by the time you grab your lash comb, you can&#x27;t run it through any lashes stuck together. After 5 mins I did a gentle eye rub test, and all those tiny clumps fell off onto my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BG-Great, but almost identical to Voluminous, which is much cheaper, so consider this a review for both.&lt;br /&gt;Pros-Goes on smooth and clump free, Separates and lengthens, you can build thicker lashes with minimal clumping if you let dry between applications. Less flaking than TR, but still a tiny bit.&lt;br /&gt;Cons- Wand is huge! I preferred Voluminous&#x27; wand. Dries less quickly (only con if you set curls). Save your money and get Voluminous, especially for a waterproof formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lancôme-I wanted to hate it, but I love it. It actually goes on and produces very similar results to the Voluminous, so if you are on a budget, stick with V and you&#x27;ll be happy. But, the formula is even smoother, the wand is really nice (a little smaller) and the waterproof formula just feels more gentle. I feel like using this stuff will be gentler on my lashes in the long run. No flaking!&lt;br /&gt;Cons-price. I never thought I&#x27;d spend over $20 on a mascara, but I&#x27;m having a midlife crisis and it&#x27;s cheaper than a corvette.</li>
    <li> This is a great mascara.  My eyelashes are not very full and long...but this gives a great look for my eyes!  Does not clump unless you apply it a bunch of times because you are lazy :)  The brush is great and I will continue to buy this mascara for awhile!</li>
    <li> I love this mascara, it really makes my eyelashes long. And I don&#x27;t have to put alot of mascara to make them long. I love it so much.</li>
    <li> I had a trial of this mascara before purchasing the full tube. Needless to say I couldnt resist buying it anymore. The best mascara ive yet to use. I have thin straight eyelashes and this definitely makes a difference. Theyre so long and dark after a few coats. Doesnt feel cakey or heavy on my eyes and is pretty easy to wash off. Doesnt smudge either. All in all a great product. Well done Benefit.</li>
    <li> After having read the raves of this mascara, I decided to give it a try despite my concerns after watching the product demonstration on one of the shopping channels.  I was simply too curious.  I&#x27;ve been using it nearly daily for the last month or so, and while not perfect, it&#x27;s not bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply mascara just like Lisa Eldridge in her makeup videos if you care about technique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Length: 4/5 There&#x27;s a definite improvement of length and I was quite satisfied with that.  Lashes looked very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Volume: 2/5 While it claims an incredible increase in volume, I didn&#x27;t really see an incredible increase - certainly not as nice as the Chantecaille mascara I was using prior to this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brush: 2.5/5 I will admit to hating the brush initially.  It&#x27;s hard when I wiggle the wand at the base of the lashes and I don&#x27;t care to use the spiky ball tip.  Eventually, it grew on me.  While not my favorite, it deposits the mascara smoothly and I got used to the hardness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Removal: 3/5 No easier or harder than any other mascara I&#x27;ve used.  I&#x27;ve never had an easy time removing mascara in the first place, but as I said, I&#x27;ve not noticed a difference one way or another with other mascaras.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall Look: 3/5 It&#x27;s very easy for this to make your lashes look very spidery (hence my concerns from the product demos).  Careful application will overcome this.  My lashes looked much longer which I liked despite the limited increase in volume.  Overall, it&#x27;s a decent mascara, but there are better on the market for the money.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara and it works very well for adding volume to your lashes. I would recommend this to anyone who appreciates good quality makeup</li>
    <li> I think I have tried every mascara on the market, and I keep going back to this one.  It is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Fake mascara, in my opinion. Literally glued my eyelashes together (top of eye and bottom of eye glued together). I do not believe this is authentic Benefit cosmetics. I wish I hadn&#x27;t been so upset and thrown it out, I could have returned it. Now I wasted my $ and I&#x27;m even more upset... buyer BEWARE!!!!</li>
    <li> Buyer beware! The mascara that I received was definitely not the same Benefit They&#x27;re Real mascara that I have purchased many times before. This mascara was like the consistancy of liquid eyeliner! In my opinion, it was a fake. The seller was easy to work with and provided me with a full refund. Pay the extra $4 or $5 and buy this mascara from Sephora.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try it but I really don&#x27;t get how this mascara is rated so highly. It goes on clumpy, makes lashes stick together, and I ultimately look like I have spider legs for lashes. Also, it is almost impossible to get off without using harsh soap. Definitely do not recommend.</li>
    <li> I got this as a sample from sephora and I decided to use it. I&#x27;ve only used Rimmel and other more affordable mascaras, but decided to see how this one worked since it was free! So I&#x27;ve been using it and I like it.i have horrible straight lashes and they suck to try to curl. I use a curler and I think this mascara is good, not amazing and the best I ever had. However, it does not leave my lashes dry like most do and glides on smoothly. End of story ; if you get the opportunity to try it for free then do it, not all mascaras are for everyone(:</li>
    <li> I ordered this based on the rave reviews but have found it to be just ok.  The brush is cumbersome and though it separates and lengthens it does nothing for volume</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara I have ever used. I bought black. I usually buy Brown products but I tried black and I love it. It stays on well and makes your lashes look great. I also like their bad girl black mascara. I buy these products from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have tried all different types of mascaras and thought maybe if I splurged I would find a really great one. However, I cannot say that this mascara is any better than the one I was previously using (Rimmel brand). In fact, even after purchasing it, I still use my Rimmel mascara. I don&#x27;t think the product is bad but it is not worth the price and it is very difficult to take off.</li>
    <li> After a long day, my foundation has evaporated. My lipstick disappeared hours ago but my Benefits mascara still stayed on. It enlongates too. I threw out all my other brands.</li>
    <li> This mascara was given as a gift which I totally appreciate. I buy it all the time from the manufacturer. But his one is a fake! I compared it to the manufacturers bottle and it looks very faded and it doesn&#x27;t have the sticker on the bottom. The container is plastic and the mascara is gooey. It washed off in flakes. Don&#x27;t buy it from amazon, or you will regret it :(</li>
    <li> great mascara...makes a big difference compared the to other&lt;br /&gt;cheap local products you get...have been using for some time and&lt;br /&gt;love it..&lt;br /&gt;thanks&lt;br /&gt;sue</li>
    <li> I wanted to believe that the cheap mascara could work just as well as expensive types, but they don&#x27;t. Spend the money, this stuff is worth it. After about a month to 6 weeks the mascara gets a little clumpy and I add a few drops of saline solution to the bottle and things are back to normal. I love that I have found a way to extend the life of this product.</li>
    <li> I really really love this mascara. Whenever I wear it, people think I&#x27;m wearing false lashes!! It works wonders and looks great. Love this! &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> The product came very quickly. This mascara worked great on my lashes,I have very short lashes and this really made them look great,I will definitely order again from this seller.product was great as was the seller.</li>
    <li> This is a great lengthening mascara. I will definitely continue to order this product again. It&#x27;s one of the best I have used.</li>
    <li> I know lots of gals love this mascara, but for me it didn&#x27;t work out. it seems like when I applied it, my eyes looked tired, sounds strange but true. Other mascaras out there that are much nicer.</li>
    <li> I have almost no eyelashes and have tried every mascara known to (wo)man. After commenting on a friend&#x27;s beautiful eyelashes she told me about this product and I ordered it right away. From the first time I used it, people started commenting on my pretty eyes! I am ordering another one today so I don&#x27;t run out. Worth the money!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with this.  OBSESSED.  I stand by it in sephora and force people to try it on becuase I think every person should try it.  By far the best ever.</li>
    <li> This mascara goes on smoothly, doesn&#x27;t clump, and stays all day.  I remove it with a bit of coconut oil.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara!!! It creates the best volume and the perfect thickness!!! I would highly recommend this mascara! AAA ++++</li>
    <li> I get a lot of compliments on my eyelashes.  It makes them look great and fake even though they are not.  I highly recommend even though it is a bit pricey.</li>
    <li> This is my all-time favorite mascara. I&#x27;m on my third tube now and I must say, I&#x27;m in love! It lengthens and adds volume without crazy clumping and smudging everywhere.</li>
    <li> I sent this to a friend to try. She loved it...and just from my own experience, it is the best mascara ever. You will find lashes you didn&#x27;t know you had.  Lengthens lashes with an innovative brush.  Stays on till you take it off with remover.</li>
    <li> A complete waste of money for me because the product made my lashes go instantly down so no visible lift at all and no base-to-tip curl.  Totally disappointed!</li>
