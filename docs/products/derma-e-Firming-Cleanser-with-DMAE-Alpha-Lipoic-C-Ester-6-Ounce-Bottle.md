<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> love the product.  Gentle</li>
    <li> Having worked in the cosmetic industry with cosmetic scientists I&#x27;m a bit more aware of things that should be avoided, labeling issues, making something appear natural etc.  I bought this on the advice of a friend who told me it had the organic certification on the back. So let&#x27;s get into what&#x27;s in here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, using the product I noticed a massive amount of foam. Foam is only found in heavy sulfates which are extremely harsh and not in European products where there is  more awareness of ingredients and side effects. (European and U.S. GOOD shampoos have little foam but they are far superior due to their lack of stripping sulfates.) However, in the U.S. we incorrectly equate foaming with \\&quot;clean\\&quot; in shampoos and other cleaning products so for years it was actually hard to find products WITHOUT sulfates--because they are cheap for companies to create and, unfortunately, they sell products because, marketing-wise the U.S. feels they are \\&quot;working better\\&quot; when they see the foam. Now that we&#x27;ve become a bit more schooled as consumers you&#x27;ll see labels that have removed them proudly proclaiming \\&quot;SULFATE-FREE!\\&quot; Sulfates strip everything...they are used in commercial floor cleaners. I&#x27;ve not been to a hairdresser once who didn&#x27;t go crazy over my hair&#x27;s health...I wash it daily but I use no sulfates in my shampoos so it shines like mad and the color never is stripped out.  So here&#x27;s the issue. I KNEW it had sulfates in it the minute I used it; I am familiar enough with them to know-- yet my own label did not list any sulfates yet it only said \\&quot;paraben free\\&quot; and not \\&quot;sulfate free\\&quot; which was a tip off . Now whether you got that label or the on on Amazon this is important: I get on here to write a review based upon some other things and I see on this page the ingredient list DOES have a strong sulfate listed on the Amazon page. So what gives? Did they \\&quot;forget\\&quot; to put it on some new labels now that we&#x27;ve become more aware and people won&#x27;t buy products with sulfates?  I already knew it was there and was upset by it and now I&#x27;m more upset to find there are two different labels for this product and one is not mentioning what I know is in there and what this product page shows is in there--but I&#x27;ll get back to the problem with this ingredient in a spell...here&#x27;s the big kicker:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, you will see the organic certification at the bottom but when I looked at the ingredients I found lots of very un-natural chemicals. Then I realized there is a tiny asterik after 2 ingredients. Then, just before the big organic certification stamp at the bottom I see a tiny asterik. Oh yes, the old asterik farce...this means those two ingredients have the organic certification. A small bit of extracts.  This product does NOT have organic certification. And it can&#x27;t...it&#x27;s not natural by any means in spite of some natural ingredients (and not much of them by the amount of sulfate obviously used. Companies can add one drop of an extract or item to a huge batch and still list it in the ingredients, we don&#x27;t know. That&#x27;s common too unfortunately so I look at what&#x27;s high up on the label. And that&#x27;s the kicker.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cocamidopropyl Betaine is synthetic as well, certainly not natural nor organic and it is another surfactant of medium strength&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT here is the whopper:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ammonium Lauryl Sulfate is the main ingredient (aside from water) according to this Amazon page listing the ingredients AND the list on all other sites that sell it that I looked at (even though that fact has been removed from the bottle). The Cosmetic Ingredient Review board has found this to be irritating and stripping to skin. However, it has suggested that it can be used in items that one does not use continually and only uses briefly or it should be less than 1% of the ingredients. Now considering this is the top ingredient we know using this daily would not only be bad and stripping for your skin but also warned against by the CIR.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now lets look at the concentration of Alpha Lipoic Acid seeing as that&#x27;s in the name of the product. Notice that is comes after extracts? Very low amounts of extracts are used in products meaning there is VERY VERY VERY little of the Alpha Lipoic Acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know what? I stopped looking there. That was enough for me. I&#x27;m returning it to Amazon. My lotion hasn&#x27;t arrived yet and I am hoping for less shock and feeling duped when I read the label. Sometimes companies are known for a good product and go cheap on others and I will hold out judgement on their lotion and not hold the ingredients in this against their other products until I know what&#x27;s in that.When I heard organic I had big hopes and I should have read the ingredients first rather than allowing them to fool me with a stamp of organic I shoulda guessed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is in no way shape or form organic. It has two organic ingredients in it and the asterik on the certified organic stamp shows that stamp belongs to only two things in it. I hate hate hate the practice of doing that. That right there is like a red stop sign to me of what I am about to find in it because I know they are playin&#x27; the consumer who knows not to look for the asterik.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is not even all-natural. The top ingredient is a surfactant. Many of the ingredients are artificial and chemical and cheap which led me to some investigative work.  I went through Whole Foods knowing that they carry this brand and discovered, to my shock, that Derma E makes several levels of product. They have some all-natural ones (none are organic) and these are what they started out with. Then apparently seeing their branding as a way to dive in there and get more profit if they did a switcheroo, they then, by the looks of things, put out several chemical cheap products. These ones, such as this cleaner are forbidden at Whole Foods where they disallow the chemical additives herein.  So you have a \\&quot;level A\\&quot; product and then a \\&quot;level D\\&quot; product by the same brand and some are banned from the natural stores yet shoppers trust the brand NAME and pay more for dishwasher soap they now are putting on their face when they buy it here on Amazon or in other stores that allow the cheap chemical harmful agents it contains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it two stars because it does clean...just too harshly but it certainly will wash off EVERYTHING because of it and they don&#x27;t test on animals and there are no parabens.d seeing as that&#x27;s in the name of the product. Notice that is comes after extracts? Very low amounts of extracts are used in products meaning there is VERY VERY VERY little of the Alpha Lipoic Acid.    You know what? I stopped looking there.

Shame.    I gave it two stars because it does clean...just too harshly but it certainly will wash off EVERYTHING because of it and they don&#x27;t test on animals and there are no parabens.</li>
    <li> Seems ok, but it burns the eyes badly even if being careful.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It leaves my skin clean, with out redidue and doesn&#x27;t dry it out. Takes all make up off. It is also great value for money as a little goes a long way. Perfect for the shower!  I am a  product junky. I have worked in the cosmetics industry most of my adult life. I have tried almost everything. This is on the top of my list of favorite products!</li>
    <li> It burned my skin and I have all these mini scabs on my face! Im praying it heals and my skin returns to normal....I noticed some swelling also...I bought this cleanser along with the cream  and had the same experience with both...what a waste of money...maybe this is just a reaction I have with my skin and doesn&#x27;t happen to everyone.</li>
    <li> I love this product, but the sender sent it improperly closed and it spilled almost all.  I had to return it and buy it at a store.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a cleanser that leaves your face smooth and really clean without the greasy feeling, try this gentle cleanser. I use it everyday morning and evening. I find that it is very effective at removing makeup. It is odorless and quite gentle. I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I really like this scrub its easy on skin and feels super good after using . I think the DermaE products really do work</li>
    <li> Works great for my wife.  It made my skin too dry.</li>
    <li> I appreciate this product being allergy friendly for me.  Product smells nice, not overpowering, cleans your face without stripping the moisture out of your face.  This is so gentle that I can use it to remove my mascara - plus is feels like there is a toner - leaving my face feeling clean and refreshed.  I like this very much!</li>
    <li> Great value dose take off every trace of makeup</li>
    <li> I have found Derma e products to be great. They are a good value and the fact that there are no harmful ingredients is important. I used to sell them in my shop but now that the shop is closed I will keep on buying them as they are the best products around.</li>
    <li> derma e Alpha Lipoic C-Ester Foaming Facial Cleanser is a great addition to my skin care treatment.  It leaves my face clean and soft but not dried out.  I love it and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Very easy to apply/ no problem cleaning mascara off/ needs very little to cleanse whole face.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product along with other Dermae E products and love their products; I do get compliments on my skin.</li>
    <li> I love derma e products, but this is a bit drying for my combination skin. I use a very small quirt to try and help with this, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to make it better.</li>
    <li> Derma e is an excellant product, small amount lather well.Removes make up,leaves skin clean, firm not tight.&lt;br /&gt;Natural product that actually works</li>
    <li> Really love this cleanser and use the face cream as well. I just got a complement on my skin and I am 61!</li>
    <li> I have tried and tossed so many cleansers I have lost count. I love this cleanser. It takes my makeup off and feels clean. Does not leave my skin feeling dry or tight.</li>
    <li> used to always pick this stuff up from Whole Foods now I just get it through Prime.  This stuff really makes you feel like your face is clean and vibrant.</li>
    <li> This is a truly great product!  My skin is sensitive and is very dry.  I was using a product at 4 times the price of this cleanser, and this cleanser is as good if not better!  It cleans gently but thoroughly and it&#x27;s keeping me looking much younger than I am.  I love it, and the great price tag!  Just goes to show us, sometimes you can pay less and get a better product.</li>
    <li> I love all the derma e products.  This is a nice foaming wash.</li>
    <li> All products recommended by Dr. Oz.  I had to try it.  Working well so far.  Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know more yet.</li>
    <li> This bottle will last a lifetime as you only need to use a bit to get a wonderful lather.</li>
    <li> It made my skin itch.</li>
    <li> This is a great face wash..  I wanted to get away from products that were not all natural and found this.. I love it and have switched to several of their products.  I you like foaming face washes as I do and are looking for something all natural this is awesome</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser and it&#x27;s FAR more affordable than purchasing at a store or online from Derma E.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if I can attest to the &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34; attribute of this cleanser, however, I do like the overall feel of my skin after using it. It feels completely free of dirt or makeup, yet gives a nice lift and glow afterwards.Some firming cleansers leave your skin feeling stripped and taut because of dryness, but this product makes you feel simply clean and hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy it again and again....</li>
    <li> I use a lot of the DermaE products and this one is just as good.  Nice suds, smells good and cleans my face.  Does the job!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s more like soap texture that&#x27;s why I doesnt like, I though that was like cream. For me, it&#x27;s irritating. But I love others products which are at the same brand Derma e.</li>
    <li> I love the Derma E line and tried this cleanser.  I had to purchase another plastic bottle and had to put the product in the other bottle as the pump on this one was broken.  That was a pain to do ( a little messy ) - all an all, the cleanser works well.</li>
    <li> This is the best cleanser.  It helps stop my redness and firms my skin. I love it!</li>
    <li> Pretty good product, I am liking it real well. No complaints at all. Time will truly tell.</li>
    <li> Got it on time &amp; I like it</li>
    <li> the pump was defective and so had to open the bottle every time to use it, which was messy. I decided to just toss the whole thing.</li>
    <li> Teriffic cleanser.  Use it with your olay or clarisonic cleansing brush!!  Mild and firming.  I even put a little on a bath puff and use it all over to stay firm all over.  Yoga can&#x27;t do it all :-)</li>
    <li> My favorite cleanser! I am 47 and my skin has gotten a little dry and more sensitive. I use it every morning and night. It&#x27;s not at all drying or irritating. Love it!</li>
    <li> I love the feel of this but was not impressed with my packaging because some of the contents were already oozing out. Too expensive to lose the contents</li>
