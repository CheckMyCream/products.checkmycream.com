<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I really like this as an all over moisturizer and as a carrier oil for my essential oils.</li>
    <li> My wife wanted the oil for her home made facial mask as a preservative. She loved it. It works well. She is using it in her home made facial mask and also home made face cream. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I love using this grapeseed oil with essential oils! It is often combined with other oils to make massage oil, since it glides well on the skin and it also has moisturizing properties. Grape seed oil has anti-inflammatory properties, for which it can provide relief against pain and swelling caused by arthritis. Even in conditions like, rheumatoid arthritis, this oil can provide great relief. Grapeseed oil appears to assist with skin repair, as it has mildly astringent and antiseptic qualities, but I&#x27;ve yet to try that. I have friends that use grapeseed oil as a cleanser - not that brave yet:)&lt;br /&gt;A warning: People allergic to grapes may not be able to use this oil, while those taking anticoagulant drugs and medications to lower cholesterol and blood pressure should better confirm with their physician before using any kind of grape seed extract including, grape seed oil for medicinal purposes. This supplement may also enhance the effects of blood thinners such as warfarin. Use of grape seed oil extract when you are taking blood thinners may increase your risk of developing bleeding complications.</li>
    <li> This is a very good natural make up remover! Just dab on a cotton ball and swipe and poof! Its gone! Also I use as a nice after shave. Its a nice carrier oil. Im very happy with my order! I got a discount for this for my feed back, the above is my own opinions. Over all it&#x27;s very affordable and a great oil for multi uses</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an allrounder, I love it. I use it for my skin to keep it smooth. I also use it for my daughter&#x27;s curly hair. The oil is 100 % pure and hexane free.</li>
    <li> I received this to review and I gotta say I love it. They are so many uses and it&#x27;s the perfect oil.</li>
    <li> GREAT for sensitive skin!! Been using this on a skin rash and it&#x27;s really, really helped. Love this, would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I got this grapeseed oil since I always seem to be reading some great recipe for homemade beauty concoctions that use grapeseed as a base. Obviously I needed to try it!&lt;br /&gt;To put it plainly: this is nice oil. Hardly any scent at all. If I had to say there was a smell, I would say it was a super light, citrusy one. It has a light texture and soaks into the skin very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I can easily see adding all sorts of essential oils to it. It&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
    <li> This is a multi use oil. i love using this for my skin and for my face... its great because it absorbs into the skin very nicely but it also can be used for your hair which i have never tried...</li>
    <li> I have really dry skin and scalp and I tried this product after I received it and it lubricated my skin and gave my hair sheen. This would definitely be a product that I would purchase in the future. Shipping was prompt from the seller!!!</li>
    <li> I looooooooove grapeseed oil! I&#x27;m a big fan of it -- I cook with it, I moisturize my hair with it, I remove my makeup with it, and I even use it to moisturize dry patches and old scars. I am a big fan of the products I have received from Beauty Aura -- I always feel comfortable using them because I know that they are high quality and not going to harm anyone in my household OR the environment. If you&#x27;re looking for a great travel-oil for being on the road (I travel a lot!) this is a great bottle to toss in your purse and take with you. You can use it on chapped lips, sensitive facial skin, elbows, knees, the heels of your feet, the ends of your hair, etc.. Basically anywhere that needs some extra TLC!</li>
    <li> I have been using this as a moisturizer on my sons arms. He claims his arms are itchy every night before bed. We&#x27;ve been rubbing a few drops of this in and he says the itches are gone!  I&#x27;ll take that as a win!!!</li>
    <li> Really great product!  I use it for everything...it is a great moisturizer. I used some on my elbows (which were really dry from the winter months) and in a couple days they were so soft!</li>
    <li> Great quality! Good carrier oil to go with essential oils as a massage/body oil . My skin looks and feels healthy and moisturized!</li>
    <li> We use this as an after shower moisturizer and it seems to keep the moisture in our skin, making it feel soft. We also mix in a little lavender oil if we use the oil close to bedtime. The smell helps to relax us as we fall asleep.</li>
    <li> This is a good sized bottle with great information on the labeling. I like how the labeling goes into detail about the benefits and uses of Grapeseed oil. It is definitely informative and helpful.The skin benefits are great, but I use this mainly on my hair and scalp. This oil is very light and not very greasy like other oils, so it’s suitable for my fine, curly hair when used before I style my hair. It leaves my hair looking shiny and less frizzy without weighing down my curls or making my hair look greasy or oily. The oil scent is a little stronger than other oils, but it’s not overwhelming; it’s just a nice grassy and natural scent to it. I actually really like it. On skin, it absorbs very easily and leaves my skin looking very healthy and moisturized. I also mix other oils with this, and it mixes well with everything.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this very light oil! It is 100% pure and HEXANE FREE, which is very important! All natural, and not at all oily once it sinks in to the skin. Has left my skin soft and easy to use with my moisturizer,</li>
    <li> Love the grapeseed oil it goes on your skin so great..sinks into skin so nice and so great as a carrier oil with your essential oils..great product..will order again..</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product! I hands down choose using the pure grape seed oil over my eye makeup remover any day! It is moisturizing, non greasy, and leaves my skin feeling great. I am pleased with my purchase and will definitely be purchasing again. The seller as well contacted me giving me thanks for business, which in my eyes is a plus to see that they are very customer oriented.</li>
    <li> Not bad at all. This works just as good as any other brand. I use it in my hair and it leaves it curly and soft. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that it has a kind of a weird smell to it. It&#x27;s not that big of a deal though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** received for review and inspection purposes **</li>
    <li> I have been needing some oil for my feet and hands because they get really dry so I thought I would give this stuff a try. This oil is great! It&#x27;s not greasy and soaks in really well. My feet don&#x27;t look as dry anymore. I&#x27;m so glad I found this product and plan on using it in many other ways as well. Next I&#x27;m going to use it on my hair to give it some more shine. I will come back and leave an updated review after.</li>
    <li> I suffer from very sensitive skin after showering. It has been a struggle finding a product where after I showered my skin wasn&#x27;t itchy. I have tried all items that were no fragrant have been prescribed items by my dermatologist..nothing has helped! After reading reviews I figured i&#x27;d tried this out and so far I have been itch free! Right after I shower while i&#x27;m still wet, I rub this over my arms and legs and let my skin absorb it. It has been working wonders so far.</li>
    <li> Great product! Love the results!</li>
    <li> Love this oil. It&#x27;s been my first time to use this and I&#x27;ve been satisfied so far. I&#x27;ve been using it in my body and it locks  in the moisture and its hexane-free which is an added bonus. I will defintely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love this product. The oil absorbs very well and does not clog pores. I use it as a moisturizer and it works wonders. I would continuously buy and recommend this product! :)</li>
    <li> I love grape seed oil! It&#x27;s so versatile. I use it as a makeup remover, moisturizer, and hair treatment. No scent which is great for those who are sensitive to that. Takes off my make so easily. This oil isn&#x27;t very greasy. It absorbs into the skin nicely. Would definitely recommend. I was sent this product for review.</li>
    <li> I love this oil. I&#x27;m using this after shower and during my hubby&#x27;s masssage. There&#x27;s no stinky smell. It didn&#x27;t break me out especially after using it on my back and on my neck. It is made in USA so I am sure it is high quality oil. The shipping was fast. I was scared that when I receive this oil, I would have any problems about leaking but fortunately it was in good condition.</li>
    <li> One of the finest, best oils I have ever used. I struggle with my skin being so dry and rough and could never find the right oil that really moisterizes my skin. That all changed when I used grapeseed oil for the first time. My skin was so soft and smooth. I could feel how nourished my hair was. I now use grapeseed oil every day as a skin Moisterizer. It also is great for hair. My husband struggled with dandruff, but after regular use of this product, he no longer suffers from dandruff. It&#x27;s nourishing properties really help hair and skin to look the very best. It is 100% organic so you know exactly what your skin is absorbing.</li>
    <li> This is great for a variety of uses; I use it as moisturizer on myself and my kiddos. It has help keep cradle cap at bay on my infant. It also works great to shave with (just be careful, it makes the shower a bit slippery).</li>
    <li> Great oil- can&#x27;t wait to use as a carrier oil for my easential oils</li>
    <li> I really liked the product.  The odor was more pleasant than other brands of grapeseed oil and had no residual unpleasant odor.  It served excellently as a skin moisturizer.  Packaging was efficient and attractive and delivery very swift. The only issue that I found that I did not find as a positive was about the bottle itself; the container was noticeably deficient in the amount of oil it actually contained, perhaps 10% short on the amount.</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth, has a natural smell, and a little goes a long way. I dab just a small dot on my face at night for moisture. In the day time, I run a little over my hands and then through my hair to give it shine and control flyaways. Don&#x27;t use too much, or you will be oily. Also great for massages, since it barely has a smell and you can combine other oils as you see fit.</li>
    <li> The oil feels nice. It does have a small organic smell, but not too strong.</li>
    <li> good product, havent tested if its really grapeseed oil and dont know if i can/will looks legitimate, says the grapeseeds are sourced from multiple countries (italy france portugal chile argentina). should note to anyone buying to run a skin test before using as i may have had an allergic reaction to it.</li>
    <li> Grapeseed oil is amazing for so many different things. I have recently been learning about its uses after receiving this product.  It is great for hair, skin and health! It is very good for your face helping with acne, aging spots, and it is an amazing makeup remover! I love to find uses for these amazing all natural oils like this.Nowadays chemicals are in everything we need more all natural products.  I got this at a discount for my unbiased review.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice grape seed oil. It had a very faint oil smell, but it&#x27;s a nice smell. Once it&#x27;s rubbed into your skin, you can&#x27;t smell it. It was a little greasier than other grape seed oils that I&#x27;ve used. It did absorb after a few minutes.  This mixed very well with ingredients I was using to make body wash. My skin is looking good since I&#x27;ve been using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be warned-if you have dogs, they may try to lick it off!</li>
    <li> I love this grapeseed oil. I love that it is cold pressed and hexane free which is hard to find . I had been on the hunt for some for a while when I was offered the opportunity to review this one at a discount. It was fate. I had originally got it to use as a carrier oil in my homemade skincare products but so far my favorite use for it has been using it straight as eye makeup remover. It has replaced my usual coconut oil, I think it works better actually and if it&#x27;s chilly I don&#x27;t have to worry about it solidifying on my counter like the coconut oil does. It has no smell and soaks into your skin quickly. It works well as a hair conditioner either in the shower rinsed out or a drop or two rubbed into the ends or on fly aways. I&#x27;m sure there are a million more uses for this awesome stuff. Can&#x27;t wait to discover more!</li>

    <li> I love this Grape seed oil by Beauty Aura! The color of this oil is a light green and it is appealing to the eye. This Grape seed oil has the smell Similar  of olive oil. It blends nicely with my essential oils making the perfect homemade products. The benefits of Grape seed oil is that it is rich in vitamins, minerals, essential fatty acids and antioxidants. You can use it as a massage oil, add it to your shampoo, or use directly on the skin.The oil surprising does not leave your skin feeling oily. It comes in a small container with an easy to open cap, which makes for the perfect size to carry/travel with. Overall this is a great product to own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Disclaimer I received this product at a discount for my unbiased review.</li>
