      <li>Its mild and unscented which I like.  </li>
      <li>It applies easy and doesn&#x27;t leave much of a residue.</li>
      <li>This is very nice serum for brightening your skin and decrease dark spots.  </li>
      <li>In general, it&#x27;s a terrific skin tonic that feels wonderful and really works.</li>
      <li>i first try it asorbed really quickly  </li>
      <li>I recently had some sun spots removed from my face by a dermatologist however; she was only able to remove the very prominent ones.</li>
      <li>We use the serum right after cleansing our face.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m even trying this on my kid&#x27;s active sores with good results.</li>
      <li>And it doesn&#x27;t have a funny smell.</li>
      <li>Thank you Puristica for making such a great, natural product containing professional strength retinol at a reasonable price!</li>
      <li>Skin feels and looks  really soft and smooth wen</li>
      <li>Its light yellow in color, which means it has real retinol in it.  </li>
      <li>In fact, I am getting ready to purchase another bottle; this time in the 2 ounce size bottle...</li>
      <li>I really like this stuff.</li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>Thanks for the discount.</li>
      <li>I will say that the product is unscented so there is no irritating perfumey smell.</li>
      <li>I have high hopes for this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>highly recommended for all skin types and conditions.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>It has really helped with dark spots on my face and fine lines around my eyes.</li>
      <li>Puristica&#x27;s serum is thick but melts to disperse easily across my face and absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>apply to clean, dry skin.  </li>
      <li>If you are looking for a product with organic and natural ingredients I highly recommend this retinol serum !</li>
      <li>so I am looking forward to the results from this natural, high potency product!</li>
      <li>My daughter and I both look years younger than our actual age, and I know with continued use of this serum, it will diminish fine lines and improve skin texture.</li>
      <li>This is a can&#x27;t live without product for me&lt;br</li>
      <li>Also the product was easy to apply since it came with a little dropper.</li>
      <li>I appreciated that I was emailed further instructions and details regarding this product.</li>
      <li>but I like that it doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell since I put it on under my daily moisturizer and makeup</li>
      <li>I was surprised that the seller took the time out to email me about my upcoming purchase, explaining how to apply the product and if I had any questions regarding the product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not really correcting the dark spots yet, but I have to give it more time.</li>
      <li>This may seem funny to say, but I have tried other serums in dropper-delivery bottles and found them to be runny or watery.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s smooth, clear of blemishes and the small lines I was getting smoothed out enough that I&#x27;ve even noticed.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only used this a couple times so far</li>
      <li>Honestly, I was skeptical of this serum.</li>
      <li>I use at night, let it dry, then apply my normal night moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>A little bit goes a long way, so a dropper full for each of us does the trick.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I ordered this product because I needed something that would help reduce the appearance of my under eye circles. I also was drawn in by its claim to reduce dark spots and wrinkles. I recently had some sun spots removed from my face by a dermatologist however; she was only able to remove the very prominent ones. I am optimistic that this will diminish the look of my remaining smaller dark spots. I have not had a chance to use the product for a long stretch so I can&#x27;t attest to the long term results. I will say that the product is unscented so there is no irritating perfumey smell. Also the product was easy to apply since it came with a little dropper. It went on smoothly and absorbed quickly into the skin with no oily or greasy feel.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product. I don&#x27;t usually put stuff on my face because i&#x27;m scared but this one works like a charm. I got this dark spots on my face because of sun exposure, when i start using this one, i noticed a difference on my dark spots, it became lighter and i know it will not take long for this to be gone.. so happy with this product and will definitely continue using this one. The good thing about this is that, i got this under a discounted price..so totally worth it!</li>
    <li> I really like this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a couple times so far but it seems to be working already.  Its mild and unscented which I like.  Its light yellow in color, which means it has real retinol in it.  I have high hopes for this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full disclosure:  I received a discount for reviewing this</li>
    <li> I feel the same way about what I put on my face as I do about what I put in my body...the &amp;#34;cleaner&amp;#34; the better. My favorite thing about Puristica&#x27;s retinol serum is the ingredient list which is full of organic and vegan ingredients and an effective 2.5% retinol. I can&#x27;t say i always eat well, but I can always put the best ingredients on my body to absorb into my skin. Like other serums, the process is:wash, tone, serum, moisturizer and that&#x27;s how I use this serum. The generous 2oz bottle holds a serum with good viscosity. This may seem funny to say, but I have tried other serums in dropper-delivery bottles and found them to be runny or watery. Puristica&#x27;s serum is thick but melts to disperse easily across my face and absorbs quickly. There is little wait time for the serum to dry before moisturizer application. I have only used the product for a short time now so i can&#x27;t speak to long-term results, but I do notice significantly more moisturized skin when I use this serum as part of my routine. My skin looks immediately plumped and refreshed in the morning, which is huge. I chose a retinol to stimulate the production of collagen and elastin so I am looking forward to the results from this natural, high potency product! * Discount given for unbiased opinion. I would recommend the product and order from the seller again.</li>
    <li> Skin feels and looks  really soft and smooth wen i first try it asorbed really quickly  i really love how fast it works  !</li>
    <li> I appreciated that I was emailed further instructions and details regarding this product. It applies easy and doesn&#x27;t leave much of a residue. I can easily apply makeup on after application. I have been using this product for almost a week, specifically for a age/sun spot. I have not seen any improvement yet but it hasn&#x27;t made it worse or burned at all. I was at the dermatologist just yesterday and I don&#x27;t know that any over the counter items will help this spot on my skin. With that said, it could very possibly work for someone&#x27;s skin especially if it&#x27;s just for overall skin health or to counteract immediate sun damage in the summer time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this item for a couple of months now with essential oils and my sun spot is entirely gone. This product was a great help and I will continue to use it for dark circles and any sun damage/age spots! :)</li>
    <li> This is very nice serum for brightening your skin and decrease dark spots.  We purchased&lt;br /&gt;the Retinol Serum in a promotion for testing and review.  A little bit goes a long way.  I like&lt;br /&gt;using Retinol and see a difference in my skin tone and texture as well as an improvement in&lt;br /&gt;fine lines.</li>
    <li> I was surprised that the seller took the time out to email me about my upcoming purchase, explaining how to apply the product and if I had any questions regarding the product. Once the bottle arrived, my daughter and I rushed to cleanse our face. We use the serum right after cleansing our face. Because we are in the middle of summer, we decided to refrigerate the serum, to preserve its quality. It feels heavenly going into our face, neck, and décolleté areas. A little bit goes a long way, so a dropper full for each of us does the trick. My daughter and I both look years younger than our actual age, and I know with continued use of this serum, it will diminish fine lines and improve skin texture. Thank you Puristica for making such a great, natural product containing professional strength retinol at a reasonable price! In fact, I am getting ready to purchase another bottle; this time in the 2 ounce size bottle...</li>
    <li> i just finished the bottle and I&#x27;ve definitely noticed a big difference in the overall appearance of my skin. It&#x27;s smooth, clear of blemishes and the small lines I was getting smoothed out enough that I&#x27;ve even noticed. Some people commented on the fragrance but I like that it doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell since I put it on under my daily moisturizer and makeup, I&#x27;d rather not have multiple fragrances mixing together and making an awful smell on my face. Buying my second bottle now.</li>
    <li> Great dose of vitamin A at the right concentration.&lt;br /&gt;Been using this product for a little over a month now&lt;br /&gt;and the results are impressive. Instantly retexturizes your skin&lt;br /&gt;without the irritation that comes with the use of retinols.&lt;br /&gt;Has greatly diminished my sun spots and evened out my&lt;br /&gt;skin, Bringing back a glow. It&#x27;s also comes in a dark, glass&lt;br /&gt;bottle to preserve it&#x27;s freshness with a glass dropper for easy&lt;br /&gt;measuring and application. Smells neutral and comes in a&lt;br /&gt;hylauronic acid base to transport the vitamin A where it is needed&lt;br /&gt;for proper skin repair and intense moisturization. The other ingredients&lt;br /&gt;in this product are pure and wholesome as in no water or artificial&lt;br /&gt;preservatives added. Which also contributes to the products quality&lt;br /&gt;and effectiveness. This is a can&#x27;t live without product for me&lt;br /&gt;and highly recommended for all skin types and conditions.</li>
    <li> Feels great on skin but still to soon to give and results on the product. I hope I can tell you more in a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I was skeptical of this serum. Even the best beauty serums seem to be mostly high hopes and high chemical content in lovely packaging. This, however, begins to make your spots tingle from the instant it&#x27;s applied and within days stubborn acne scars and age spots are on the decline. I couldn&#x27;t be more thrilled. I&#x27;m even trying this on my kid&#x27;s active sores with good results. In general, it&#x27;s a terrific skin tonic that feels wonderful and really works.</li>
    <li> good stuff just the right stuff I love how it works</li>
    <li> I ordered this product at a special price to review.  This Retinol Serum does not burn or cause redness!  You need only a tiny bit...apply to clean, dry skin.  I use at night, let it dry, then apply my normal night moisturizer.  Great value for the money!!  Will definitely order again when I get low.</li>
    <li> I tried this because of the money back guarantee and I have to say I love it!  It has really helped with dark spots on my face and fine lines around my eyes. I can see a visible difference.  It has helped to restore my skin tone and even the color on my face and neck.  Great serum for a great price!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a more natural form of retinol and this is a great product. I loved that the compay emailed me before it arrived to inform me of the best way to use, with specific directions on application. I recently strted using this product and it is suggested that you wait a month before you see visible results. My skin already appears better,in terms of redness, and has less of a dull tint to it. If you are looking for a product with organic and natural ingredients I highly recommend this retinol serum !</li>
    <li> My wife has been using for the past few days and she says it has taken away some of her blemishes on her face that she has had for years. She said it also has taken away some wrinkles as well.</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff. It absorbs great. And it doesn&#x27;t have a funny smell. It&#x27;s not really correcting the dark spots yet, but I have to give it more time. I love how my skin feels after applying this. Thanks for the discount.</li>
    <li> Great product! Does what it says! I look way better! I can go out with out putting lots of cover up.</li>
