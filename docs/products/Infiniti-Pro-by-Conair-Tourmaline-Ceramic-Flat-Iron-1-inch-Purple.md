      <li>Awesome flat iron!</li>
      <li>But I still think it would do a great job because the high heat capabilities.</li>
      <li>It stayed straight for a good week amd</li>
      <li>It does tend to get warm on the handles right by the plates</li>
      <li>straightens my hair well, very quickly and smoothly.</li>

      <li>Love this flatiron, it heats ups quickly and leaves my hair sleek and shiny.  </li>
      <li>With this iron, coupled with argan oil, my hair looks and feels silky smooth for 2 days.  </li>
      <li>make my hair nice and straight.</li>
      <li>would definitely recommend this to anybody looking for a cheap(ish) straightener that does a great job on all hair types.</li>
      <li>and it feels like it&#x27;s made out cheap material</li>
      <li>I always thought that higher heat would fry my hair, but my hair looks and feels so much better with this iron</li>
      <li>Worth the $40!</li>
      <li>Heats up real quick and gets really hot.</li>
      <li>This Flat Iron is amazing!</li>
      <li>It took a couple of tries to find the perfect setting for my hair (between 18-20), but the instructions that come with this iron are very helpful in guiding you to the right heat settings for your hair type.</li>
      <li>This flat iron works as any good flatiron that is like $100</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never had a straightener that wasn&#x27;t at some salon work so quickly and easily.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Heats up really quick</li>
      <li>so you may have to get used to just moving your hand an inch or so towards the bottom while using, I adjusted quickly.</li>
      <li>Overall excellent product for only 30 some bucks.</li>
      <li>, I don&#x27;t use the highest setting because it gets very hot</li>
      <li>The variable heat settings work wonderfully, and it gets hot enough where only one or two swipes with it</li>
      <li>Heats up extremely fast, gets super hot, and glides smoothly over hair.</li>
      <li>Works great on the rare occasion that I want my extremely curly hair to be stick straight.</li>
      <li>pink for your liking) but still very stylish and adds color to your hair appliance collection.</li>
      <li>I have a blow dryer from Conair that I purchased about 30 years ago and it still runs like new!!!  </li>
      <li>and I get my whole head of hair super sleek and straight in 20 minutes!</li>
      <li>Gets a little hot, but it was a good deal  </li>
      <li>I have never ever had this straight of hair, even after an hour of using dryers and straighteners!</li>
      <li>Does get hot and hair does straighten but ceramics are not aligned so it takes 2 passes</li>
      <li>Then I fojnd out, that the plates don&#x27;t meet..past the first inch from the tip?</li>
      <li>and it gets too hot to hold.....</li>
      <li>Heats fast!</li>
      <li>Absolutly love these flat irons.</li>
      <li>I love how how it has long plates</li>
      <li>Though I didn&#x27;t buy this flat iron on Amazon, I love it so much, I felt compelled to write a review.</li>
      <li>Works great without spending the huge amount of money on the very expensive hot irons.  </li>
      <li>the product arrived so fast.</li>
      <li>Heats up fast too.</li>
      <li>I just had too much trust..</li>
      <li>I have really frizzy/curly hair</li>
      <li>I recommend it highly!</li>
      <li>Smooth on the hair, doesn&#x27;t pull and it heats up quickly and cools down fast.</li>
      <li>so if you have problems with Straighteners just not getting hot enough to do the job quickly then this is for you.</li>
      <li>This flat iron makes my hair so soft, smooth and shiny!</li>
      <li>I put it on the highest setting and it took less than a minute to heat up, then it worked its magic.</li>
      <li>times.&lt;br /&gt;Since Infiniti was the main contender for lower cost, its on to an older friend, Babyliss.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>It works even better than a model I bought previously out of a salon that cost over $100!</li>
      <li>my curls reverted right back when I co-washed!</li>
      <li>The plastic of the 409 label got on the straightening plates and wouldn&#x27;t come off, so I needed to buy a new one.</li>
      <li>My hair has never been able to hold a curl, and not only will this create a curl that holds, but it only takes 15 mins total to curl all of my hair (and I have a lot of hair).</li>
      <li>and it was on a pretty low setting ( i dont want heat damage).</li>
      <li>but I was actually amazed the first time I used the straightener.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works great without spending the huge amount of money on the very expensive hot irons.  Heats up fast, slides easily, no complaints.</li>
    <li> Worst thing in the world.. I have short curly but tamed hair, and I have used conair before.. I still do. But this machine as of now is sitting in the back of my closet because it simply DOESN&#x27;T work. The plate heat up from the outside causing finger burns, and your hair will get stuck at the bottom of the machine.. It was a waste of my time and money..</li>
    <li> Great product. My hair has never been able to hold a curl, and not only will this create a curl that holds, but it only takes 15 mins total to curl all of my hair (and I have a lot of hair). Heats up extremely fast, gets super hot, and glides smoothly over hair. Only complaint would be that the plastic on the outside of the plates gets too hot to touch, so you can&#x27;t hold on any higher than the base. Some would say that that should seem obvious and that you shouldn&#x27;t want to hold on up there anyway, but sometimes when you have to twist your wrist in odd angles to get to certain sections of hair, it causes an issue. Either way, I would still recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This Flat Iron is amazing! I am African American with 4b hair and wanted to straighten my hair for the first time. I only had to go through my hair twice to get a straight look and it was on a pretty low setting ( i dont want heat damage). It stayed straight for a good week amd my curls reverted right back when I co-washed! I love how how it has long plates so it doesnt take that long to straighten my hair. This flat iron is everything! I definitely recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> Heats fast! Light and easy to handle. Replaces my awkward clunky iron</li>
    <li> I have a blow dryer from Conair that I purchased about 30 years ago and it still runs like new!!!  That&#x27;s why I decided to try this flat iron and I love it.  It irons my hair with ease and comfort.  I recommend it highly!</li>
    <li> This is by far one of the best straighteners I have ever used. It doesn&#x27;t burn your hair, or make your hair smell weird. I loved the bonus jar of argon oil!</li>
    <li> Awesome so satisfiedjust received them today</li>
    <li> Who needs a $100.00 flat iron when you can use this?!? I love it! I love the color as well :))</li>
    <li> Wow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is THE BEST straightener I&#x27;ve ever owned. I have long, wavy hair, but it&#x27;s rather unruly and half the time I&#x27;ve got a little afro going on like a little halo on my head. With previous products it&#x27;s taken upwards of 45 minutes to an hour if I do it properly, whereas with this straightener it takes me TEN MINUTES.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This might sound a little ridiculous but I was actually amazed the first time I used the straightener. I put it on the highest setting and it took less than a minute to heat up, then it worked its magic. I&#x27;ve never had a straightener that wasn&#x27;t at some salon work so quickly and easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to anybody looking for a cheap(ish) straightener that does a great job on all hair types.</li>
    <li> Love this flatiron, it heats ups quickly and leaves my hair sleek and shiny.  The  1 1/4&amp;#34; size is perfect.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> better than the expensive hair straighteners.</li>
    <li> Love it! Best amazon buy yet! Smooth on the hair, doesn&#x27;t pull and it heats up quickly and cools down fast. Way better than my chi. So glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> Does get hot and hair does straighten but ceramics are not aligned so it takes 2 passes and it feels like it&#x27;s made out cheap material and it gets too hot to hold.....</li>
    <li> Absolutly love these flat irons. My hair looks and feel like I just left the salon. Heat is equally distributed through my hair without burning my hair. I Thank God for these flatiron</li>
    <li> The description was is not what I received. The product said it comes with &amp;#34;Includes extra-long swivel cord and heat-resistant puch and mat&amp;#34;.  There was no heat-resistant pouch (punch) as they have it or a mat. That was one of the reasons for buying this one because I figured it was saving me money from having to buy them.  Otherwise as far as the iron goes works great! I love the way my hair feels after using it even without using anything on my hair.</li>
    <li> Absolutely nothing wrong with this product!!! Very pleased. .</li>
    <li> This thing works better than a chi ever did. Heats up really quick and I love the auto shut off feature. I would tell anyone look for a cute and great working straighter this would be the one to get.</li>
    <li> Beware. It leaves your hair with an awful smell.&lt;br /&gt;Medium to thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;Setting on 20 as to not burn my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Use a heat protector.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May return due to the smell</li>
    <li> It works wondefully in wavey hair!</li>
    <li> I love how quickly this straightener heats up. It works even better than a model I bought previously out of a salon that cost over $100! A great deal, and a great result.</li>
    <li> Money back please worst ever hated it mine caught on fire</li>
    <li> Gets a little hot, but it was a good deal  and I&#x27;m happy</li>
    <li> Works great on the rare occasion that I want my extremely curly hair to be stick straight. The variable heat settings work wonderfully, and it gets hot enough where only one or two swipes with it make my hair nice and straight. I lent it to one of my friends after her Chi had been stolen and she loved it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard horrible reviews on this item. I&#x27;ve had it a few months now and haven&#x27;t noticed anything wrong with it. I used to have a very expensive one and it works just the same. It&#x27;s a little bulky, but hey you get what you pay for</li>
    <li> I have thick, partially wavy hair. I have never ever had this straight of hair, even after an hour of using dryers and straighteners! This is amazing! Worth the $40!</li>
    <li> Minimal heat settings and have to run over hair 3x to get the effect wanted.  I feel like it leaves the ends a looking a little rough as well.  My last flat iron lasted 12 years (not kidding). It was made my Kenta and had a curling iron style handle...it worked great on my wavy hair when it met humidity.Unfortunately it&#x27;s been continued.  This Conair was rated highest in it&#x27;s price range when I researched.</li>
    <li> I really love a lot of things about this straightener.  I always thought that higher heat would fry my hair, but my hair looks and feels so much better with this iron and I don&#x27;t even use the highest heat setting.  I was using a YouStyle Straightener made by Conair, but it only heats up to 360 degrees.  It was taking me forever to straighten my hair and I would have to totally redo my hair the next morning if I didn&#x27;t wash my hair.  With this iron, coupled with argan oil, my hair looks and feels silky smooth for 2 days.  Even my husband has commented on what a difference it has made.  I wake up and he&#x27;s amazed that my hair looks the same way it did when I went to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaints are that it does tend to pull some hairs once in awhile, and the I think I would prefer the 1 inch iron over this one.  I thought since I have longer hair that this one would be better, but a 1 inch iron is better for rounding out my ends and for touching up my side sweeping bangs.</li>
    <li> This flat iron works as any good flatiron that is like $100, I love it ! And I am a natural hair girl with really thick curly hair but every once in a while I get a wash and set and use this to go over my hair at times but after one use I don&#x27;t need to go over my hair at all</li>
    <li> Awesome flat iron! I have really frizzy/curly hair and I get my whole head of hair super sleek and straight in 20 minutes! Heats up real quick and gets really hot. Ive used babyliss for years and this one is even better! I recommend</li>
    <li> I bought the one-inch version from my local CVS, but then accidentally dropped it on a bottle of 409. The plastic of the 409 label got on the straightening plates and wouldn&#x27;t come off, so I needed to buy a new one. Buying this wider Conair model online was a better price than buying a one-inch Conair at CVS again.&lt;br /&gt;This straightens my hair well, very quickly and smoothly. Makes it shiny. I love it and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Excellent size and heat control!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few weeks and I love it. It leaves my hair soft and shiny even without the argon oil they supply. Very bright and beautiful pink(you have to like pink or it may be too &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; pink for your liking) but still very stylish and adds color to your hair appliance collection. I have thin long hair and it doesn&#x27;t take long at all, I don&#x27;t use the highest setting because it gets very hot so if you have problems with Straighteners just not getting hot enough to do the job quickly then this is for you. It&#x27;s not too big so you can get close to your roots. It does tend to get warm on the handles right by the plates so you may have to get used to just moving your hand an inch or so towards the bottom while using, I adjusted quickly. Very nice plates, makes hair so nice. I recommend if you have hair that isn&#x27;t too coarse, only because I can&#x27;t tell how well it would work obviously. But I still think it would do a great job because the high heat capabilities. Oh and be careful with the oil, don&#x27;t use too much and DON&#x27;T use it near roots unless you like the dirty looking hair look. I only use it on bottom 5 inches or so where it&#x27;s dry. It&#x27;s a nice freebie. Heats up fast too. Overall excellent product for only 30 some bucks. Be careful if you try to find it in stores tho, Walmart had one I thought was the same but it wasn&#x27;t tourmaline ceramic. Just be careful if you chose to not buy it here.</li>
    <li> I got the one inch iron. Too bad, I did not give it any type of trial for about two months. Then I fojnd out, that the plates don&#x27;t meet..past the first inch from the tip? This is not the Infinity Pro that I came tolike.. or trust.&lt;br /&gt;Its unfixable and no, I am not trustong Infiniti Pro now.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe in person, when one can take it out and check the plates. I just had too much trust..My bad..&lt;br /&gt; Infinity PRo was a competitve brand. Still has god prices..BUT plates that close down evenly on your hair..is basic to expect, at the least.&lt;br /&gt;I added one extra star because I could have returned it, but its too late now. Poor quality IS a TRUE 2 star..if it cant do 20% with out a re-do, minimally 5 times.&lt;br /&gt;Since Infiniti was the main contender for lower cost, its on to an older friend, Babyliss. Preferring a 3/4 or 1/2 is best for great root-lift, and straightening.&lt;br /&gt;Stay leery, beautiful people..</li>
    <li> Though I didn&#x27;t buy this flat iron on Amazon, I love it so much, I felt compelled to write a review. After much hunting and research (and a recommendation from Consumer Reports), I decided on this flat iron when my old one started to fail. First, I have very dry, frizzy, kinky and generally unmanageable hair. This flat iron makes my hair so soft, smooth and shiny! It heats up very quickly (in just a matter of seconds) and takes no more than two run throughs (often only one) to make my hair straight. Also, its size is perfect for creating a fun flip at the bottom. I love all the heat settings, as well. It took a couple of tries to find the perfect setting for my hair (between 18-20), but the instructions that come with this iron are very helpful in guiding you to the right heat settings for your hair type. I highly recommend this iron and think it works just as well, if not better, than more expensive models.</li>
    <li> the product arrived so fast. Very good, and he answered my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;It came well packed!&lt;br /&gt;I liked it a lot.</li>
    <li> Love it! Works on thick natural hair.</li>
    <li> I finally got my perfect straightner .. my hair used to be curly, now is a mess. I have used the expensive kind of flats including CHI, none of them worked for me. But this Infiniti Pro is just right for my beautiful hair.</li>
