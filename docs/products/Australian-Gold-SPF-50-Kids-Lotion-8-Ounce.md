      <li>it&#x27;s sickeningly sweet and not coconut or anything similar.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
      <li>I recently moved to a hot climate, and have been struggling to find a sun tan lotion that I can use on my face frequently, but won&#x27;t cause me oily skin to break out!</li>
      <li>My son, on the other hand, had Australian Gold products on his face and body and he was fine.  </li>

<li> Works well, I use it everyday.  </li>
<li> and it&#x27;s less expensive if you purchase it through Amazon</li>
<li> This fills the bill and is not greasy, seriously, who needs that?!</li>
<li> Plus I was very disappointed that it is NOT AN AUSTRALIAN PRODUCT at all</li>
<li> You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
<li> and I have never been disappointed with the quality.</li>
<li> Very disappointed and would not recommend.....</li>

    <li> Good sunblock. It feels very nice on the skin, easy to apply, provides great protection and is very water resistant.</li>
    <li> I was so shocked when I smelled this stuff because there were so many great reviews about the smell so I was expecting something like coconut and tropical - beware....it&#x27;s sickeningly sweet and not coconut or anything similar.  Plus I was very disappointed that it is NOT AN AUSTRALIAN PRODUCT at all......and that&#x27;s the reason that I bought it because I thought it would be superior to an American product due to Australia&#x27;s intense sun.  It&#x27;s also extremely drying .......and the smell makes me nauseous.  Very disappointed and would not recommend.....really can&#x27;t figure out all the glowing reviews.</li>

    <li> I have been using this product for years. It works as intended, smells great and it&#x27;s less expensive if you purchase it through Amazon</li>
    <li> I was looking for a sunscreen that has \\&quot;safe\\&quot; ingredients and yet still works. This fills the bill and is not greasy, seriously, who needs that?! The scent is a little \\&quot;gas station bathroom orange\\&quot; but other than that I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> This is another great Australian Gold product.  I always wear it at the beach.  I wished that I used it last week at our company picnic instead of my usual moisturizer with SPF.  I got a mild  sunburn.  My son, on the other hand, had Australian Gold products on his face and body and he was fine.  Lesson learned.</li>
    <li> Smells good non greasy and waterproof for 80 minutes.  You can&#x27;t go wrong. I&#x27;ll never use another brand and I&#x27;ve tried them all</li>
    <li> Great product!  I highly recommend it.  Doesn&#x27;t leave your face look like you&#x27;ve just seen a ghost.  Pleasant odor.  Protect afforded is outstanding.  I have a very light tanning of my skin.  Doesn&#x27;t look as if I had been in the sun.</li>

    <li> Very moisturizing, with a wonderful smell.</li>
    <li> Have used the lotion often. First time used the face protection. The face lotion is a nice thickness and applies easily. The scent is fresh and non-irritating. The tube is a good size and can go in carry-on. The cap sealed well and there was no leakage. We will buy and use this product again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the body products for years and love them.  Very pleased with the scent, weight, and coverage of the Sheer Faces.  Nary a burn after a week in the Caribbean sun!</li>
    <li> My entire body got sunburned except for where I put on this product.  I&#x27;ll be switching to this brand permanently.</li>
    <li> Works well, I use it everyday.  Smooth, almost creamy, and smells great!</li>
    <li> This brand works better than any other sunblock/sunscreen we have tried. It does not leave your skin sticky, has not caused breakouts like some and has a nice smell. This is the only brand we will now use.</li>
    <li> I recently moved to a hot climate, and have been struggling to find a sun tan lotion that I can use on my face frequently, but won&#x27;t cause me oily skin to break out! Thankfully this little beauty seems to have done the trick, as of yet it hasn&#x27;t upset my skin and it feels great when I put it on, very light and non greasy. I would definitely give it a try for the money.</li>
    <li> Has the equivalent of sun protective metals like zinc, but other similarly effective chemicals instead-checked this with my dermatologist as I have had basal cell carcinoma on my face.l. It is very important to put it on 15 minutes before sunning. I love the texture. It goes on smoothly and sinks right into my skin. No odor and doesn&#x27;t look white unless a lot is applied.</li>
