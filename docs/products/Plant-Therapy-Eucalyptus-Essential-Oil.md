<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good product for a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> This oil is very affordable and it smells great.  I purchased this oil to wash my bedding with.  I suffer from allergies and my biggest allergen is dust mites and I read an article that said eucalyptus oil helps kill dust mites in/on bedding.  I&#x27;ve used the oil several times and haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference in my sleeping/allergy symptoms, however, I love the way my sheets smell after I launder them with it.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product! I use a few drops of this oil in my diffuser almost every night. It clears up any nasal or throat congestion without the stickiness of Vicks or side effects of a cold medication.</li>
    <li> I wish all of the essential oils came in larger quantities and cheaper.  You can go through a lot of this stuff, depending on what you&#x27;re using it for.  This was authentic eucalyptus oil.  Great quality.</li>
    <li> Tried to make my own thieves type oil blend, as the brand of oils I normally use were not available. This did not come out smelling good or anything like what I&#x27;m used to. I can only hope this blend will still be effective in keeping my family healthy this winter.</li>
    <li> It is not that the product doesn&#x27;t do what is expected, it is that I have found 20 times the size for 20 times less price making this one week lasting element truly expensive. Yes, it will last only one week or it simply add zero scent to the surrounding air. Very expensive, short lasting, and barely scented oil.</li>
    <li> This essential oil has been very helpful in cleaning the house.  I will be purchasing some more very soon. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> The package arrived quickly and the product smells divine.  It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> The plastic stopper used to keep the oil from dumping out gets stuck in the cap, so if you aren&#x27;t paying attention, or someone is using your steam room and they don&#x27;t know to look, you can dump an entire bottle out in about 0.5 seconds... A bit of a design flaw.</li>
    <li> great therapeutic quality essential oil.  I recommend this as a quick go to option.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a laundry additive to kill dust mites, but once I read on the label that it can be used for sore muscles, that has been its sole use in our house.  Works great, smell is not overpowering, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. Will definitely purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Love the quality :) very happy!</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Use it in the steam room and it is lovely. Thanks.</li>
    <li> My naturopath recommended that I use this in a neti pot for allergies. It works really well. Its high quality essential oil. I highly recommend for whatever you&#x27;re using it for.</li>
    <li> I use this with my CPAP machine for hay fever season and cold season. Keeps you clear, it&#x27;s like putting Vicks on your upper lip without the burn!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! Mer all of my expectations and then some. Shipping was perfect!</li>
    <li> Must give 5..I didn&#x27;t think the scent was strong enough but my son said it was..so depends on the person</li>
    <li> Wonderful aroma, better than anything we have tried in the past. will reorder in the future, price is right.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Plant Therapy&#x27;s essential oils are a must.  The Eucalyptus is great for my allergies and sinus headaches.  I diffuse this along with Rosemary and Peppermint and my headaches go away - awesome stuff.</li>
    <li> Love it!  High quality product and performs beautifully.  Will buy again!</li>
    <li> Was hoping it would give me some relief from my always clogged sinuses.  I put several drops on a cloth by my CPAP machine to help me sleep but  really didn&#x27;t help.  I did however find some relief tho.  A Tablespoon of apple cider vinegar in a glass of diet lemon lime soda cleared my sinuses in two hours.  I now take it twice a day and my sinus problems that had gone on for years has nearly disappeared.</li>
    <li> Very good quality at a good price.</li>
    <li> Strong scent so the bottle has lasted me quite a long time.</li>
    <li> Worked like a charm! Only problem is that it turns out that I&#x27;m not a big fan of Eucalyptus. No qualms with the product though, just not a fan of the strong smell.</li>
    <li> we are a huge plant therapy fan!</li>
    <li> used for the entire winter, and my asthma has improved greatly! Fast delivery too!</li>
    <li> Definitely helpful for breathing.</li>
    <li> I used this product @ my gym sauna. For those experienced using gym sauna, the smell in there can be pretty uncomfortable sometimes. Couple of splashes of this eucalyptus oil will help with cleansing the stuffy smell and also therapeutic after a hard workout. People usually appreciate this drops. From the several researches with different brands, it seems that this brand product is cost efficient compare to others. Also, the strength seems to be there. The shipping was incredibly fast. Will continue to buy this product.</li>
    <li> Absolutely THE best essential oil I have ordered to date. Will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the product, it is exactly as advertised. I am using it in a diffuser and my house smells wonderful. Even my teenagers have commented that the house smells good. If that&#x27;s not high praise, I don&#x27;t know what is! Thanks for a fantastic product.</li>
    <li> This product is of good quality and doing a great job clearing up our stuffiness due to allergies. I will order it again.</li>
    <li> I use this essential oil in a diffuser in my bedroom -- apparently it is beneficial for sinus problems.  Plant Therapy essential&lt;br /&gt;oils are of high quality, I believe.  I seem to be feeling a bit less congested....so far, so good.  Smells wonderful, also!</li>
    <li> I purchased this item to make a natural tick and flea repellant for our dogs and ourselves.  We&#x27;ll see how it works.</li>
    <li> good product, good price</li>
    <li> I am using this oil for my new, green approach to cleaning my house, it has great properties including: antibiotic, anti fungal, antiviral, and antibacterial! I use it in cleaning all over the house. My favorite use is sprinkling a little around the bed or furniture.&lt;br /&gt;  My husband has horrible allergies and asthma, I put some on the corner of his pillow and it instantly calms and helps his symptoms. Putting a couple drops over a hot rag and breathing that in helped a bad attack the other night.&lt;br /&gt;  Not to mention it makes my floors smell great, I love having it in the house!</li>
    <li> Someone made a mistake on the label. This absolutely do not smell like eucalyptus. If you want the real thing don&#x27;t get this.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with this eucalyptus oil. The smell is nice and strong. I get frequent sinus congestion and this is my go-to product when I need to clear my sinuses and breathe better. I&#x27;ve mixed it with a carrier oil and rubbed it into my temples, neck, etc. I&#x27;ve added it to a diffuser. I&#x27;ve put a few drops on a warm rice bag to lay on my shoulders. And when I was really sick and couldn&#x27;t breathe through my nose I took a bath and put several drops of this oil on a warm, wet wash cloth, draped it over my face and breathed through it until my nasal passages began to clear. I will definitely order more when I run out.</li>
    <li> Love the fresh smell.  Arrived quickly and safely.  Will reorder when this is gone.</li>
    <li> I purchased this oil to sprinkle around my house to keep my kittens out of unwanted areas, WORKED LIKE A CHARM! I will say be careful this stuff is POTENT my nose was burning so bad when I went overboard...lol</li>
    <li> THIS OIL DOESN&#x27;T HAVE A GOOD SMELL, AND IT IS NOT VERY STRONG. THE SCENT GOES AWAY IMMEDIATELY AND THE SMELL ISN&#x27;T THAT GREAT TO BEGIN WITH.</li>
    <li> I bought the Eucalyptus Essential Oil for a couple reasons.  One of which was I read it took grease stains out of clothing (did not) and the other was a household \\&quot;tip\\&quot; for making bathrooms smell better.  I read that if you insert a few drops on the inside of the toilet paper holder cardboard, each time you rolled the paper, the smell would be activated (that also didn&#x27;t work).  It could be I had a couple bad \\&quot;tips\\&quot; but I personally don&#x27;t think the odor was as strong as I had hoped.</li>
    <li> Very good quality product.  You only need a little to get a great smell.  Great for so many things.  Recommend it</li>
    <li> Decent quality and a good price for the quality of the oil. Well worth the purchase.....especially given a little goes a very long way!</li>
    <li> Bought this eucalyptus oil to add to our vaporizer when we have colds. It has a very strong scent, that fills the room nicely. Even though it is a small bottle, you only have to use a couple drops, so I&#x27;m sure it will last quite a while.</li>
    <li> Good quality oil in glass bottle with built in dropper. I got the 1.21 oz. bottle instead of a 1 oz. Bonus!</li>
    <li> Use this in the steam room everyday after the gym. Smells great, clears the sinuses, and makes the lounge period very enjoyable.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the product.  Oils are easy to use.  Packaged well and sent quickly.  Love the scent as I diffuse the oil</li>
    <li> We purchased this product in anticipation of cold/flu season coming in just a few months.  With 6 kids (yes), and asthma, allergies, and the regular gunk kids share at school, we hoped this would help.  We found a recipe to make some homemade &#x27;vapor shower tablets&#x27; that included eucalyptus essential oil.  This oil is a great quality, and is priced very well for the amount too.  And just making the tablets and the resulting fragrance through the house helped clear all the noses!</li>
    <li> I love these essential oils I got from this company! All of them have a good strong and lasting scent and they were very reasonably priced!  I will be buying more..  GREAT for soap and candle making!</li>
    <li> I love this product and great prices.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product and I highly recommend Plant Therapy of all of you Essential Oil needs.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for something to help with receding gums and I thought about trying this product after some research.  It really seems to be helping with shaking teeth but I have been using this product for only 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> Good product, 100% pure as specified and helps a lot when my kid has flu, he is only 6 months so it&#x27;s a good replacement of medicine, which in my country they give only if it&#x27;s really bad</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many brands of Eucalyptus Oil. Plant Therapy is the purest and strongest oil I have used. I have also used their Tea Tree Oil and Lavender Oil....love them all!</li>
    <li> I use this in my steam room and it is really rejuvenating -- works great, would recommend!  Bob -- Thank you!</li>
    <li> Why pay $25-$30 for Mr. Steam oil??  This is an excellent product at a fraction of the price. My steamroom smells great!!</li>
    <li> I love this eucalyptus oil ! I&#x27;m my modest opinion it&#x27;s one of the best , very natural and doesn&#x27;t burn your nose !&lt;br /&gt;Thank you , I&#x27;ll be back for more</li>
    <li> I was very sick during the last two weeks of tax season, and bought this to help clear out my lungs.  I put a few drops in olive oil and rubbed it on my chest.  I also put a few drops in my diffuser at night.  It really helped.</li>
    <li> I use it with a portable vaporizer ........ A couple of drops is all I need and it gets the job done !</li>
    <li> I use it to enhance nasal moisturizer spray. This is very powerful oil, make sure you try it one drop at a time and test it.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use in making my own \\&quot;chest rub\\&quot; for colds. It is amazing and takes me back to being a kid when my Mom and Grandma would rub Vick&#x27;s on us. Smells great and I added a few drops of peppermint also. Super!</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t seen any spiders since I have started using just a spot on a few places in bedroom. I would hate to get bitten by a spider.</li>
    <li> not sure about different oil prices else where, this one smells nice, but for this small bottle, the price is expensive!</li>
    <li> We have our own steam bath in the master bedroom of our home. Adding just a few drops of essential oil to the steam makes it very relaxing.</li>
    <li> Very potent and delicious</li>
    <li> Very nice.  Good quality Eucalyptus oil.</li>
    <li> Useful for henna tattoos and smells minty</li>
    <li> We put this on our pillows to reduce snoring and stuffiness. This was reasonably priced and has a good scent.</li>
    <li> Received in great shape a few drops on pillow case works for a good night sleep. Look forward to more use of differ oils for different neefs</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Use it in my diffuser combined with lemon and oil scents. It&#x27;s also great for clearing sinuses. Dab just a few drops under the nostrils.</li>
    <li> Smells great.  I can&#x27;t wait to use it.  I bought it to repel ticks.  i hope it works.  I am using more natural products now</li>
    <li> I have ordered several essential oils from Plant Therapy and this is my favorite.  There products are shipped in protective wrapping and smell wonderful.</li>
    <li> Great smell. Love to mix this with grapefruit essential oil. Worked great in my oil burner and in bath salts and sugar srubs. Invigorating scentand clears the sinuses. I also used this in my steam cleaner while declaring war on a flea outbreak. After weeks of daily vacuuming and steam cleaning everything with this oil, I proved victorious without having to go chemical warfare. (Also switched topical flea treatment brands on my pets.)</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Works great in my vaporizer. I don&#x27;t wake up with stuffy nose or horrible sinus pressure or headaches. Great product.</li>
    <li> I have ordered the Eucalyptus Essential Oil several times. For me, Eucalyptus is the ultimate &amp;#34;relaxation&amp;#34; smell sensation. I use an eye dropper and put three full droppers worth in a small spritzer and top off with water. When I want to experience the sensation, I mist the area with several sprays. It is a great smell! The price is so very good that I keep reordering! I also like the Lavender but Eucalyptus is so much my favorite, I use it the most. If you like the relaxation smell of Eucalyptus, there is several ways to use it! Give it a try! I just love it and will keep ordering it! Delivery is quick and the price is right!</li>
    <li> I have no idea why this product claims to smell of Eucalyptus.  It smelled like some kind of strong chemical.  The odor stayed in my home until I wiped down my WC with Lysol. And the smell still lingered for another few hours. I will never purchase or recommend Eucalyptus Essential Oil, 30 ml 100% pure undiluted Therapeutic Grade to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 1 star because there was nothing lower.</li>
    <li> I use this as a calming agent and it works.</li>
    <li> Amazing, better than expected. Its potent and nice sized bottles! This is the Only eucalyptus oil I will buy now!</li>
    <li> Plant Therapy is my new go to place for essential oils.  Can&#x27;t beat their prices and quality.  Don&#x27;t buy anywhere else!</li>
    <li> Love this brand - very satisfied on all of their scents</li>
    <li> Excellent quality for therapeutic grade uses. A little goes a long way, and I will buy again in the future.</li>
    <li> Great to keep on hand, love using it.</li>
    <li> Eucalyptus oil is great to help keep sinuses clear and breathing passages open, especially at night.  Use in a vaporizer or place a few drops on a tissue next to where you&#x27;re sleeping.  I use it daily and have placed several orders with Plant Therapy.  Service is always great.</li>
    <li> Fantastic!!! Very strong smell. Perfect for the Sinus Bombs and other decongestants I am wanting to make. Got to my house two days after I ordered it too.</li>
    <li> The oil is as pure as stated. I am glad that it was not one the overly diluted ones. Well packaged and met expectations.</li>
    <li> quite happy with my oil order :) will purchase more in the future</li>
    <li> Good product not much to say about it, I would recommend to a friend!</li>
    <li> I bought this product after a couple months with a nagging cough. After doing some reading I chose to try Eucalyptus. I use it in a steamy shower or applied externally and it helps both to relieve the cough and to clear out my chest. No regrets.</li>
    <li> Does a good job of clearing my sinuses, but the bad part about this oil is that it makes my dog really sick when I use it. I later found that eucalyptus oil is bad for dog&#x27;s digestion, no wonder she would always throw up when I used it in a diffuser. I now limit its use to stove top so my exhaust fan can rid the air of the fumes after I use it. I did try it as a muscle rub, works great, but my dog wouldn&#x27;t come near me till after I showered.</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery of this item. I really liked that.</li>
    <li> Smells great! Doesn&#x27;t have an artificial scent, it&#x27;s natural &amp; works well in my homemade house cleaners ( eucalyptus has so many benefits , one being antibacterial)</li>
    <li> This eucalyptus oil is very concentrated. I&#x27;ve used it semi-regularly (3-4x a week) over a period of 3 months, and I&#x27;m sure it will last me another 6 weeks. I dilute the oil for use in the sauna, with 10-12 drops for every 500 ml. of water. The high quality of the eucalyptus has turned me into a popular individual at my communal sauna, serving as a fantastic ice breaker among partially clothed men.</li>
    <li> This product is far more &amp;#34;mintier&amp;#34; than expected. Because it is 100% pure, I suspect I am just not accustomed to pure eucalyptus.</li>
    <li> This product does the trick! I use it in the humidifier and with 3 of us in the house , not one has had a cough from winter. House smells nice too.</li>
    <li> I love all of the Plant Therapy essential oils. I bought a few different brands of oil and did the construction paper test where you put a tiny drop on the construction paper and if it goes away completely you know that it&#x27;s 100% pure. I tried five different brands. The only two that were 100% pure were the Plant Therapy and Young Living ones. The Plant Therapy brand is much, much less expensive than Young Living so I&#x27;m a huge fan!</li>
    <li> The oil got here pretty quickly and smells fantastic. However, it kind of concerns me that it evaporates if I just leave it in a cold oil-warmer overnight. When actually heating the oil, it doesn&#x27;t last long and you have to keep refilling. I just got it, and I&#x27;m already 1/3 of the way through the bottle. The eucalyptus oil I had before lasted a lot longer.</li>
    <li> Plant Therapy Oils are reasonably priced and high quality.  They are packaged well and arrive on time.  I will buy again! The Eucalyptus Oil helps when I have a stuffy nose from allergies or a cold.</li>
    <li> My family and I we do love it, seller ships very quick and it seems we are cough free so far this winter. We do use it  for chest rubs and would recommend it. Thanks</li>
    <li> I found another brand that gives better results.  Yes, it costs more but you get what your pay for.</li>
    <li> Shipped somewhat fast, exactly as pictured.</li>
    <li> I use this oil in our humidifiers and also in the water pot on top of our woodstove.  It actually has antiviral properties and smells great.  Also works great for a sick or croupy baby</li>
    <li> Do NOT buy this if you want something that smells like eucalyptus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells like a mix between pine sol and ammonia.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;I have been putting some in some boiling water.  It helps with odors and sinuses.</li>
    <li> I just made body lotion using the Eucalyptus oil.  I needed very little oil to capture of essence of Eucalyptus.  I am very pleased with this quality product.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my brother and he loves this essential oil for the steam room at his gym.</li>
    <li> My wife enjoys pure natural products-only. This product is good. Just not as good as others she has purchased in the past.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to add to my personal vapor diffuser.  It&#x27;s great for congestion.  My husband has been stealing it to put a bit below his nose as he likes the clearing action for his sinuses.  It&#x27;s a nice size bottle and it came quickly and without problems.</li>
    <li> Second time ordering great product. Fast shipping use in steam shower all the time. Added bonus bigger bottle free. Will order again.</li>
    <li> I bought this to add to hot water for a sinus vapor-inhalation therapy.  The price is decent for the amount and the product is very concentrated.  Works well to open up the sinuses when added to a bowl of near boiling water, then place towel over bowl and head and inhale.  I used it with peppermint oil.  If you add the peppermint oil, you only need one or two drops or the resulting vapors will be like inhaling CS gas.  The eucalyptus oil isn&#x27;t as powerful as the peppermint, so you can add 5-10 drops and it won&#x27;t overpower.  This bottle is a good value for the price.</li>
    <li> wonderful to sleep by.</li>
    <li> Wife is using EO for variety of purposes.  This EO seems to be high quality and was shipped quickly.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Great oil...many uses</li>
    <li> This oil is very concentrated, a little goes a long way.  I would have given it five stars if the price was a little lower.  Love the scent!</li>
    <li> This bottle of essential oil arrived promptly and has a lovely, strong fragrance.  The best thing about ordering online from this vendor via Amazon is that one does not need to worry about whether or not it&#x27;s  \\&quot;in stock\\&quot;  or finding a salesperson to find it or unlock the appropriate cabinet (both situations I&#x27;ve run into when trying to buy essential oils).  I&#x27;m not too familiar with these products ... so I&#x27;m trusting to my fellow reviewers to give me the inside scoop.  I hope you ALL are writing in to share your experiences.  This product arrived on time and in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> Works great in my steam shower. Blah blah bleh blih blaah blaaah blaaaah  why do I have to write so many words.</li>
    <li> I get colds and sinus infections very easily, and I have asthma. This oil helps clear me right up. Nice.</li>
    <li> It is the real thing very poten or strong more than what I expected it to be,you get rid of stagnant air in a room are the whole house.</li>
    <li> such a great smell especially mixed with henna</li>
    <li> I really love this scent. My whole family loves it! I have been using it with mint and lavender in my diffuser and it has been very helpful for my husbands allergies.</li>
    <li> Great value and is a great oil. I have alot of sinus headaches and this mixed with a few others helps a lot. Thanks for a great value!</li>
    <li> High quality oil for a great price. I was very impressed and will order again. I use the oils on me and diffuse throughout house.</li>
    <li> I purchased this and added some to a bag of epsom salts to use in my bath.  It helped with my congestion  Have several bottles of this brand and have been very pleased/</li>
    <li> I just love it!  Its the best that I have tried so far.... Wish they had bigger bottles! I will buy it again!</li>
    <li> Just put a few drops in a sprayer and mist your bed room, or things that are often touched. Door handles, bathroom areas, phones. A great natural germ fighter. Is NOT to be taken by mouth. Or put directly on skin. However you can add a drop or two to any other carrier oils. I recently got a cold before I received the Eucalyptus. I put a few drop in a pan of water and let it simmer for awhile while cooking dinner. My nose cleared up and I slept much better. I even put a drop on my pillow case. This helped.</li>
    <li> Our daughter has terrible allergies. We have had to find medicines, treatments, supplements, etc. to help her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For reasons that are unknown to us, she has her worst issues with congestion and sniffling AT NIGHT.  If she catches a cold, it is worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One obvious thing we did and do sometimes still is to put her in the bathroom and run the hot water, with several drops of this in the tub and let the steam open her nasal passages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have an older home that quickly develops mold issues (which are NOT good for her) so we can&#x27;t regularly use a humidifier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We found that those Vicks strips that you plug in (VapoPads) are really helpful at night. But so did many others apparently, and for some time we couldn&#x27;t find them in stores (from Kroger to Target to Walmart to CVS they were sold out all the time!).  People were buying them in large quantities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those things are so helpful and I was so desperate. One night, while our daughter was miserable sniffling (despite prescribed medication even!) I decided to take some of this product and a bit of water on an older strip and plug it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tada! I had an instant homemade strip (VapoPad), to replace the ones I simply could not find in stores here! I was able to do it more than once, too, with the ones I had left over. Usually I only used one VapoPad per night and then threw them away and bought more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  I am quite aware this is NOT the intended purpose for this product (the eucalyptus oil) or the VapoPad. But our daughter was miserable - we had used everything we could without using things that were contraindicated to one another and I honestly could find a VapoPad anywhere in this city (I guess everyone was miserable with cold and/or allergies).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I am also not the type of person to sue people for my own concoctions and mistakes. So if it doesn&#x27;t work for you or you burn your house down, please don&#x27;t sue me, Plant Therapy, or Kaz USA (the Vicks&#x27; people) or AMAZON - you have been warned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I have told many people (including people at church and people in drugstores desperate to find these plug in things) and this DOES work for them, too, and if you are careful and make sure to use both WATER and this essential oil in the right ratio, you should be fine.  The strip should be just a bit translucent when you slide it in the plug in device and I would also suggest that you leave it plugged in only for as long as you or your child starts breathing normally, then unplug it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AND I am sure if you have an essential oil burner, this would work well.  The oil is POTENT. I have also put it in with other essential oils in baths with our daughter and she has had no allergic reaction or sensitivies (and her skin is sensitive).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck, and great product.</li>
    <li> I dilute this oil with water and spray it over hot stones in the sauna. This oil has a musky odor, I find it unpleasant and will not use it again. I have used Aveda brand eucalyptus oil which has a very pleasant eucalyptus scent. I have returned to using the Aveda brand.</li>
    <li> great oils, eucalyptus strong, good for diffuser or carrier oil.  I got an extra 1/3 ounce free!</li>
    <li> Very good, pure Eucalyptus! This is 100% Eucalyptus and therefore smells very strong, not chemically like other reviewers have stated, just as its supposed to! Most Eucalyptus is cut from full strength, If you aren&#x27;t familiar with 100% OIL it may be strong at first, but that&#x27;s the way its SUPPOSED TO BE! One must understand Oil from a plant can smell VERY DIFFERENT from the leaves of a plant. Giving a bad review based on ignorance is helpful to no one!</li>
    <li> I NEEDED SOMETHING TO MAKE THE STEAM ROOM IN MY FITNESS CENTER SMELL BETTER.&lt;br /&gt;THIS BOTTLE AND THE EASY DROPPER DOES THE TRICK.</li>
    <li> not sure if its a 5, but works ok</li>
    <li> I love the smell of eucalyptus!  Its powerful. I use this to massage my husband alone with rosemary.  Work wonders to relax and calm. So nice on sore muscles alone with other base oils such as sweet almond or avacado oil. Jojoba oil is also great as a base. Plus add to distilled water in a spray bottle and you have an air freshener plus oder eliminator.</li>
    <li> Using this in a diffuser.  My house smells amazing, very soothing.  A little bit goes a long ways</li>
    <li> Excellent quality essential oils!</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and was as promised. The oil smells really good.</li>
    <li> The best Eucalyptus oil I have found!</li>
    <li> I use this to mix w/fragrance-free body wash as a natural repellant to help keep the biting insects away.  This oil is especially effective for me and I would recommend it to anyone.  Shipping was fast and order was correct.  Can&#x27;t ask for anything more.</li>
    <li> The oil was expertly packed and shipped with my lavender oil - no spills, no issues - Perfect!  I use just a drop of Eucalyptus oil in the shower when I want that \\&quot;wish I was at the spa but can&#x27;t get there\\&quot; feel ... not only does it make the shower more relaxing (lotsa hot water!!!) but the bathroom afterwards is just lovely.  I also put just a drop or two of oil in a cup of hot water in the bedroom right before bed - just wonderful.  I love the fact the oil is without fillers or perfumes.  Recommended</li>
    <li> I use quite a few different brands of essential oils and I have to say this is - hands down - one of the worst brands I&#x27;ve ever purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within minutes of heating this oil the Euclyptus aroma was gone and a pervasive smell of smothering, repulsive oil permeated my apartment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have high hopes of using the remainder of this oil to fry some Mahi Mahi later on this evening or perhaps I&#x27;ll order a quart next time to use for making fried chicken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should have gone with \\&quot;Eden&#x27;s Garden\\&quot; brand which I&#x27;ve purchased before on Amazon, but decided to give this brand a try as it offered free day shipping with Amazon Prime.  Big mistake.</li>
    <li> Have not tried yet but feels and sells as I was expecting.  No skin irritation.</li>
    <li> I used this to make and lotion and will use this in other things I will make. will recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> Received the extract fast and was wrapped securely. I have used it on a cotton ball and rubbed some in my nose to help with stuffiness. I plan on using it with a diffuser and inhaling it into my sinus&#x27;s. Very pleased with the product. I have never had this type of oil so I can&#x27;t compare it to other brands. but it seems pleasant to me.</li>
    <li> I have purchased other brands of eucalyptus oil but this is my favorite. I just love the way it smells. I put a few drops in my bath along with Epsom salts, or put a few drops on my pillow case when I have a cold. Love it.</li>
    <li> I just wish it was organic, my fault for ordering it. Considering this is most beneficial to the lungs... Let the relentless search begin!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I have a steam shower, but I find myself using it when I just shower. It has a shaker spout so very little can come out to sprinkle on the shower floor. The smell is true and pure. This product is highly concentrated and the bottle is large and will probably last me many, many months.</li>
    <li> We love this product!  We use it in the shower, if we get a cold.  A couple drops in a steamy shower.</li>
    <li> I add this to the bath when kids are sick, works wonderfully. I also add some to a carrier oil to rub on backs and chests during colds.</li>
    <li> This is such a great value! We use this in our humidifier every time we run it and it helps clear the air so we all breathe easy during the night. It is especially helpful since we live in such a dry climate.</li>
    <li> using in conjunction with my cpap machine, works and smells great.</li>
    <li> I use this in my steam shower, it always arrives quickly and the product is wonderful.  The eucalyptus is strong enough without being overpowering.</li>
    <li> necessary if I have a cold</li>
    <li> This is an ok product, just doesn&#x27;t seem as strong as I expected it to be. Good for chest congestion and adding to cleaning water</li>
    <li> Opened up my sinuses, but I had rubbed a drop on my wrists as instructed on Dr. Oz. After 3 days my wrists got itchy and red, but I could breathe.</li>
    <li> Great quality product with an easy dropper cap built right into the top. I use this for aroma therapy in and it smells great</li>
    <li> wonderful ! wonderful !</li>
    <li> I add a few drops with my humidifier when I go to sleep. It really makes a difference. This is also nice for putting in to a pot of simmering water. I&#x27;ll put a towel over my head and breath in the vapors. It also can be added to a warm wash cloth to relieve congestion. This bottle was a good value. The product appears to be pure as claimed. It has a control dripper so you never over-pour.</li>
    <li> Great to use with humidifier and oil burner -- helps with my asthma and cold symptoms. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I use these oils in my humidifier, and the smell is quite pleasant in the whole house. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Smells great.  It says not to use it at full strength but I&#x27;ve not had any issues with it.</li>
    <li> Always a pleasure! Great quality and super quick delivery!</li>
    <li> I love the product, I put the oil in my little burner, and my whole house smelled like Eucalyptus oil.I was very happy with this supplier, I was promised a ship date and my order arrived before the promise date. I would definitely order from Plant Therapy Essential Oils again!!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected! Delivery was fast.</li>
    <li> Exactly what it says it is. Good value, too.</li>
    <li> I love this oil! I use this alot  in the winter time. So I always have it on hand. I really love it!</li>
    <li> Purchased this oil to use in my diffuser.  I love the smell of eucalyptus and this oil smells fantastic!</li>
    <li> very happy with both quality and delivery of this product. Will return for more!!!</li>
    <li> Quality and amount is pretty good and has that clean smell.  The disperser works well with little fuss.</li>
    <li> Sinus problems? Chest congested?  This is a product that will help. I use it with steam (in a bowl) or I sprinkle some out of the stream in a hot shower.  Helps every time.</li>
    <li> The refreshing soothing curing eucalyptus smell without having to get Vix Vaporub on something!  I love this.</li>
    <li> Lived near several eucalyptus plants when I was young and now I keep this on my desk and when the wind blows the right way I can&#x27;t help but smile. Not over bearing but simply perfect.</li>
    <li> I am using Eucalyptus oil for the past 20 years for several usages like defusing, bathing, steaming etc. This oil defenitely smells different than a quality oil. Looks like old stock. I&#x27;ve purchased few Plant Therapy oils before and they were good.</li>
    <li> please the product does need to be thicker and does not hold smell very long  at all I use these oils for my perfumes because of my COPD can  not use over the counter fragrance please either maker the oils thicker ,maybe I could mix young living oils with the plant therapy so it would last</li>
    <li> Smells good and seems very good quality.</li>
    <li> nice to open up the nose</li>
    <li> My son had bad sinus problem.  Every morning when he woke up his nose was blocked and he could not breathe smoothly.  Also he had frequent bloody nose and bad headache sometimes.  The symtoms was worst in the morning and got better after he got into normaly activities.  After my wife read some online blogs we get this stuff.  Every night we put a couple of drops on a tissue and laid the tissue beside his face so he could sleep while smelling this stuff.  Weeks later, we noticed that his sinus problems have gone, and he is not waking up with sneezing, bloody nose and breathing problems.  Headache is much less frequent.  This really saves him.  I really recommend those parents with kids having same sinus problems give this stuff a try.  After one month, you&#x27;ll know if this works for you or not.</li>
    <li> I ordered this oil because I read that Eucalyptus oil (and trees) help prevent fleas from getting in your house. I had no idea what all it could be used for. I have used it not just for fleas (DO NOT apply to your pets! Google how to use it around your house to help prevent fleas), but in my bath and as a rub for sore muscles. I recommend, however, that you research how to dilute it before you using it on your skin ( I mixed it with coconut oil to rub on my sore muscles ). This is a great product.</li>
    <li> I am a university student. There was a very nasty flu flying around recently and I happened to be one of the \\&quot;lucky\\&quot; recipients of this gift of sharing. I prefer to treat myself with natural herbs so made sure I was getting plenty of vitamin C, Echinacea-Golden Seal complex, organic Neem herbal supplement and Ricola lozenges for the throat. I know that boiling water with a few drops of eucalyptus oil in it can help clear your breathing as well as using the drops in your shower or a few drops on a cloth placed on my night stand near my head. Unfortunately the shop on campus was out and I needed it right away. I was so happy at how quickly I got my order; within two days! I had managed until then with steam showers but adding the eucalyptus oil really helped make the affects last longer. I was sick for only a week and had no long lasting cough that I used to get when I used OTC medications in the past. Thank you! :)</li>
    <li> Saw this on Dr. Oz… It is a natural decongestant! Love the product</li>
    <li> I use this in my humidifier (Honeywell with a replaceable wick).  The amazing thing is that when Eucalyptus oil is added, it acts as a bacterostat and I can now go WEEKS without having to clean the humidifier.  (I use to have to scrub out at least once weekly.)  The wick lasts longer, too.&lt;br /&gt;I just give the tank three shakes of the bottle.  One bottle lasts 4 months or more.&lt;br /&gt;Eucalyptus may or may not improve respiratory health, but it smells OK and seems to be safe to inhale.  But killing the bacteria in the humidifier that we don&#x27;t otherwise have to breath, now THAT is healthier!</li>
    <li> I lLove this product!!!&lt;br /&gt;I bought this to use in my front load washing machine for the mold/mildew that builds up in the door gaskets.  Had I known the front loaders doors gaskets were so poorly designed &amp; held sitting water that grows mildew, I never would have purchased it.  My son recommended this eucalyptus oil as a solution because he uses it in a steamer for fungus &amp; mold allergy treatments for his sinuses. It works so wonderfully, it&#x27;s the only solution we&#x27;ve found that works!&lt;br /&gt;I also have used it on carpet areas where pets have had accidents.  Eucalyptus has natural antibacterial agents in it, so I feel safe using it. The bonus is the great fresh smell!&lt;br /&gt;Love this product! I wish it came in larger bottles!</li>
    <li> HAVE ORDERED THIS OIL FROM THIS SELLER VIA PRIME FOR MONTHS WITH NO PROBLEMS. UNTIL THIS MONTH, ORDERED THE 30ML BUT RECEIVED THE 10 ML.  NO PROBLEM AS AMAZON QUICKLY REFUNDED MY MONEY.  BUT THE THING THAT IRKED ME ABOUT THIS WAS THAT SOMEONE HAD STUCK A 30ML LABEL RIGHT OVER TOP OF THE 10ML LABEL.&lt;br /&gt;SO, I THOUGHT I WOULD JUST LET IT PAST AND ORDERED THE 30ML REPLACEMENT.&lt;br /&gt;NOW, THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE PRIME AS IT IS CLEARLY LABELED.  BUT WHEN DID PRIME GET TO BE 5 DAYS FOR DELIVERY?  STILL WAITING FOR THE REPLACEMENT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS OIL IS GREAT AND I USE IT NIGHTLY MIXED IN MY DIFFUSER WITH THE LAVENDER TO BOTH RELAX ME AND HELP ME GET TO SLEEP QUICKER AND STAY ASLEEP LONGER.  THIS OIL IN WITH THE LAVENDER HELPS WITH MY NIGHTLY CONGESTION.&lt;br /&gt;The oil itself deserves a 5 star, but the seller now rates only a 3 star with delayed shipping and wrong item shipped prior to the latest delayed item&lt;br /&gt;SINCE THE SELLER IS PART OF THE PRODUCT IN THIS CASE, IT DOES EFFECT MY RATING&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE ON JUNE 11:  BUYERS BEWARE&lt;br /&gt;AFTER RECEIVING 10ML BOTTLE ABOVE FROM PLANT THERAPY FOR THE 30ML ORDERED, I QUICKLY RECEIVED A REFUND FROM AMAZON AND TURNED AROUND AND REPLACED THE ORDER FOR ANOTHER 30ML BOTTLE.  UNBELIEVABLY, IT CAME IN TODAY AND AS BEFORE SOMEONE AT PLANT THERAPY HAD SLAPPED A 30ML LABEL RIGHT OVER TOP OF THE 10ML LABEL WITH THE 10ML BOTTLE INSIDE.&lt;br /&gt;WOULD NOT HAVE BELIEVED IT IF NOT SITTING HERE LOOKING AT IT.&lt;br /&gt;  THIS IS NO LONGER A SIMPLE MISTAKE.  BUYERS BEWARE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REVISED AGAIN ON JUNE 13:  WELL, AFTER AN INVESTIGATION BY AMAZON AND PLANT THERAPY, TURNS OUT THIS WAS SHIPPED THRU AN AMAZON FULFILLMENT CENTER WHERE THE MIS-LABELING OCCURRED AND THE DELAYED PRIME SHIPPING.  AMAZON ISSUED AN IMMEDIATE REFUND AND PLANT THERAPY HAS SAID THEY WOULD SEND A 30 ML REPLACEMENT DIRECTLY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AS I SAID EARLIER IN THIS REVIEW, I DO LIKE THIS OIL AND HAVE USED IT FOR MONTHS AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO ONCE I CAN BE ASSURED BY AMAZON THAT I WILL RECEIVE THE SIZE I PAY FOR.  UNTIL THEN, I WILL BUY DIRECT FROM PLANT THERAPY.  PLEASE BE AWARE THAT THIS SELLER, PLANT THERAPY, IS NOT AT FAULT FOR THE MISHANDLING OF THIS PRODUCT.WILL RECEIVE THE SIZE I PAY FOR.  UNTIL THEN, I WILL BUY DIRECT FROM PLANT THERAPY.  PLEASE BE AWARE THAT THIS SELLER, PLANT THERAPY, IS NOT AT FAULT FOR THE MISHANDLING OF THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> I was buying Eucalyptus pills. They seem to work a little better but the oil works just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put a drop on a q-tip and brush the inside of my nose. Lasts for a good hour or so.</li>
    <li> I use Eucalyptus Essential along with Rosemary every day.  Mixed with distilled water, a little Dr. Bronner&#x27;s, vinegar and borax, it makes the perfect green cleaner for anything.  Mixed with Rosemary and distilled water, it makes the perfect room freshener, getting rid of smells and negative energy, filling the room with positive energy, clearning the space.  Blessings and peace.</li>
    <li> Love this brand, all of the oils I have purchased from them have been great and they are very reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> I am pretty disappointed.  I&#x27;ve purchased 4 bottles of Eucalyptus from Plant Therapy over the last few months and use them frequently.  The first two bottles I received were wonderful!  I absolutely loved the scent.  However, the last two bottles have had a chemical/perfume-y smell to go with the eucalyptus scent and it completely changes it- negatively.  I&#x27;m still hopeful that Plant Therapy will go back to their previous formula, but, until then I will likely look elsewhere for my oils.</li>
    <li> With flu season here, we use this product as a sanitation cleaner for our books, it helps cut down the spread of germs and it smells good.</li>
    <li> I have been purchasing several different brands of essential oils in the last 6 months, trying to find a high quality oils that are not totally exorbitant. I realize you get what you pay for and I am not opposed to paying for quality, but these oils are mid-low grade at a a high grade price. If they are going to charge so much they should at lease increase the amount/size of the bottle.</li>
    <li> All the products I have received from Plant Therapy Essential Oils have arrived well-packaged and have worked well for my uses.  Also Plant Therapy is great as far as service is concerned- I happened to mention in an email that I had received Lemon Oil instead of Lemon Grass Oil and even though I didn&#x27;t ask for a replacement, Plant Therapy volunteered to send one anyway.  That doesn&#x27;t happen too often with ANY company!</li>
