<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not good as doterra on guard.its more eucalyptic.</li>
    <li> Bought for daughter, she seems pleased.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for three months now and am very satisfied with the quality of the product.</li>
    <li> I add a little bit of sweet orange oil to make it more like Doterra&#x27;s On Guard.</li>
    <li> We are first time users of essential oils and this has been a very positive experience for us. I had read reviews on Four Thieves and decided to try it. My wife got a cold just before receiving our order and we used it to help clear her congestion. Worked pretty well. It does not have a sweet scent that is over powering and we like that. It just has a clean refreshing smell that is very enjoyable.</li>
    <li> This is a great oil at a good price that works competitively with other higher priced oils. Pleased with using it so fair.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve used Young Living for years but with using it at home and diffusing it daily in my classroom the price was just too steep to continue buying it.  I tried this brand and am pleased to say that it seems to work just as well and smells identical when diffused - in the bottle it has a slightly different smell then Young Living Theives, I would say that Eden&#x27;s Garden uses more Eucalyptus in their blend.  Diffused though I can&#x27;t tell the difference between the two.  Otherwise for topical applications we have noticed no difference between this and Young Living brand when it comes to quality.  We will continue to buy Eden&#x27;s Garden and I am eager to try the other blends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would also like to add that as a family we do not ingest essential oils and I do not believe in ingesting them so for us the extra cost involved in purchasing brands like Young Living and DoTerra that claim they can be ingested is not worth it.</li>
    <li> I first received this oil as a gift with a diffuser.  I started aromatherapy and now I can&#x27;t live without this oil.  A bonus is that my cats also adore the delicious vapor from Four Thieves.  This oil provides a healthy and delightful addition to our home.  I have subsequently ordered more and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> This is the best thieves I&#x27;ve used and the price is right</li>
    <li> Seems to work very nicely. My husband had influenza A and I didn&#x27;t catch it. He doesn&#x27;t use Four Thieves!</li>
    <li> great product, great smell, love it!</li>
    <li> BEST EO ever!!!!!  Smells so good and really helps the immune system!  Love EG!!!!</li>
    <li> LOVE IT - it smells so good.  Even works on blemishes/scars.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about this oil. This is the 2nd bottle. Am using this as help this winter to keep all the sicknesses away from me. So far so good. Seems to do the job. I put a drop of carrier oil and a drop of Four Thieves in my palm, rub them together and apply on the soles of feet every morning. Every type of Edens Garden essential oil that I&#x27;ve bought has been of good quality. So I will continue to buy their products. Love them!</li>
    <li> Amazing smell, big bottle is nice, lasts longer.</li>
    <li> I love this oil I use on my feet every day with oregano oil to stay healthy and also mix in a spray bottle with water for a natural sanitizer and room spray. I love the smell of Four Thieves it smells like Christmas in a bottle to me.</li>
    <li> I love this blend especially around Christmas/winter time and it even claims to kill airborne bacteria/viruses. It smells like Christmas in a bottle. I have been constantly diffusing this in my ultrasonic diffuser and have received many compliments. A definite repurchase :)</li>
    <li> Love this blend... Was using young living but with a family of five needed a better financial choice... I have been using this product for a year and I love it</li>
    <li> The awsomeness of Edens Garden strikes again.  Have you seen there product catalog?  The informative literature that came with was excellent.  I was as impressed by the graphic design as I am by the quality of their products.  I am going to put one of these in my bug-out bag. In the event of a zombie apocalypse this oil could save your life.  Last year, putting a few drops of this into my nitequil helped kick the full on flu in three days.</li>
    <li> I really like the scent of this blend. I haven&#x27;t been able to use the product yet because of my travels with my job but I&#x27;ll be on vacation soon. I have no doubt that this will meet all my expectation expectations.</li>
    <li> Theives essential oil is amazing stuff. I use it with my diffuser and it smells good too. It has a fresh clean aroma to it. I have also used it for a sore throat, the kind where I could not swallow very well. I put 3 drops on a teaspoonful of honey and took it in the morning and again that evening. The next morning my sore throat was completely better and never got worse. I also have a friend whose father has lung cancer and was not able to swallow very well and they took it like I did for the throat and in 2 days he was able to swallow much better. It works better than over the counter medication and no side effects. I love it!</li>
    <li> Luving this! Diffuse it in my home and when I start to feel sick I use it on my hands feet etc...</li>
    <li> A good product to use in the winter months particularly.</li>
    <li> i love it.want to stay healthy</li>
    <li> Have been diffusing this almost nonstop for a week now. We love it. DD hasn&#x27;t felt well and this is soothing and strong. I love that we can use this more natural approach alongside her RX to help her with her asthma and cold.</li>
    <li> Love the scent and like it for cleaning.  It IS powerful, so dilution of some kind is important.  I mix with water for cleaning or just mix a small amount in with a bag of baking soda and spread over carpeting, but if you have pets, especially cats, it might be wise to take care. Some of the oils may not be something you wish your pet to lick off their coat.  Check ingredients, powerful oils!</li>
    <li> Helps keep me healthy!</li>
    <li> This has become our family&#x27;s favorite oil.  My husband even asked for this and a diffuser for his office, as he likes it so much.  He&#x27;s normally very sensitive to aromas and I used this with caution to not set off his allergies.  But it&#x27;s perfect and we all enjoy it.</li>
    <li> This is very good and seems to be of great quality.</li>
    <li> My favorite of all essential oils!</li>
    <li> Like I said in the message to you, I just LOVE your Thieves Oil and will ALWAYS buy this.</li>
    <li> Great scent reminiscent of cinnamon and wood that I use in a dry steam diffuser for the living room. Love it.</li>
    <li> Not nearly as nice as Young Living&#x27;s &amp;#34;thieves&amp;#34; blend, but a much better price point.  Needs more cinnamon and clove, a little too much eucalyptus gives it that yucky string smell.</li>
    <li> Great mold, virus, bacteria killer.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Love love love this particular essential oil! I defuse it with hydrogen peroxide and to cleanse and oxygenate the air and I also add it to my homemade cleaning supplies</li>
    <li> Diffuse this in my home daily.  Have noticed a marked difference in illness.  It WORKS!</li>
    <li> I really like the smell of this oil. My diffuser has been puffing away day and night since I received it. As far as it keeping us from getting sick, I can&#x27;t say, but I do love the smell. I have never used the more expensive MLM oils, but it only stands to reason that they have to cost more to pay all the down lines.</li>
    <li> Very good essential oil! the quality of this oil is comparable to doterra on guard and it works great! I use it in exactly the same way as the doterra products.</li>
    <li> i use this with a carrier oil (apricot) every nite. I like the fragrance, and the massage i give myself with it makes me feel good</li>
    <li> LOVE and use it a lot.  Thank you for a great item.  I purchase regularly.  It&#x27;s strong, so I use very little.  Even better.</li>
    <li> Just like the more expensive oils from another company but just as good and less than half the price...</li>
    <li> Four Thieves is my families favorite.  You will never be disappointed with this scent.</li>
    <li> I love the quality of Eden&#x27;s Garden products! No leakage during shipping. Great price for this amazing quality!</li>
    <li> I love this so much. I dab some on cotton and put it in the grills of the swamp cooler and a/c to clean the air, use it in my laundry, bath, cleaning the floor... It&#x27;s awesome. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this... I absolutely love diffusing this.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love the smell of this blend!  I mix a few drops with my foot lotion, and body lotion at night when I go to bed, and although it doesn&#x27;t help me sleep necessarily (that&#x27;s what I have lavender for), I love the tingle it gives me, and my overall sense of well-being I get from using it.</li>
    <li> I love the way this makes the house smell.</li>
    <li> Wonderful , will buy more, use all over the house</li>
    <li> This oil in particular had been one of four that I had decided to examine from Eden Gardens. I would say it is an especially powerful scent that is best enjoyed by those not with a sensitive smell. It is very earthly with The Cloves and Cinnamon especially shining through. Once settled in the aroma you can also easily detect the Lemon and  Eucalyptus which I find gives a curious effect to this oil. Rather gives the tone of warmth followed by a cooling sensation. If you are looking for a more subtle and rather interesting blend of Oil I would also suggest Earth And Wood by the same seller.</li>
    <li> A wonderful thieves blend that I use in my soapmaking. Love it!</li>
    <li> I use this oil daily more so when traveling -- it prevents illness.  I highly recommend and it&#x27;s a great value.</li>
    <li> When I feel a bug coming on this is in my diffuser for a few nights.</li>
    <li> Not exactly the same as what you get from the original Thieves from Young Living, but close and a cheaper price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of months along with some of the other Edens Garden synergy blends because I liked the scents in my diffuser.  I caught a cold 3 days ago and immediately put this in my diffuser and also rubbed it on my feet (I read that somewhere) daily, and even at my desk at work I ran the diffuser all day.  It is day 3 and my cold is almost gone!  In my 49 years on this earth I have NEVER beaten a cold in 3 days!  I&#x27;m a believer now!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this oil several times, and I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll buy more.  It has many uses and even has helped family members fight MRSA.  Just speaking from our own experience...we think it works.  Essential oils are worth researching when antibiotics are coming under fire so much as not always being the best option to treat different things.  Judge for yourself.</li>
    <li> I love this oil. I have used it in a tea for a sore throat. I have also used it as a cleaner,and hand sanatizer.</li>
    <li> MUST for the flu season</li>
    <li> This was also a Christmas gift and they love it!</li>
    <li> This is a great EO for sinusitis.  Love it.  Very pleasant so company just thinks your house smells good!</li>
    <li> I love this blend! It energizes me and heals me. I use it everyday after showering. The synergistic oils that comprise this blend have powerful healing, pain relieving and muscle calming, nerve regenerating properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another plus is that the costumer service people at Edens Garden are very nice and quickly help with delivery problems or any  confusion about their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say, I am pleasantly surprised and I will order from them again. Also, you can&#x27;t beat their prices, they are a smallish company only selling retail rather than wholesale; they state on their labels that their products are 100% pure and of therapeutic grade. They also have a few organic EOs.</li>
    <li> I like it a lot and am using it mixed with coconut oil to dry up a fever blister.  It is amazing.</li>
    <li> I diffused this as well, thanks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eden&#x27;s Garden</li>
    <li> The good oil. It&#x27;s so soothing to use and apply and it really relaxes me a lot after a stressful day.</li>
    <li> This smells AWFUL. I made an antibacterial mix and no one can stand to be around where ive sprayed it.</li>
    <li> Putting this on the soles of your feet is like getting a 5hr footrub! Good for cuts and bruises as well.</li>
    <li> This oil was delivered right on time and I was very happy to have it come through USPS so that it wouldn&#x27;t be left on my doorstep like other carriers. The oil has a wonderful smell and a lot of health uses. Right now I am using it to heal a boil and it is working perfectly! I also put some on a tissue and put it in my pillow to help during this allergy season.  I would highly recommend Edens Garden for their prompt delivery and also for the high quality of the oil itself.</li>
    <li> Use this for so many things. It is really amazing how handy this stuff is. Works great in diffuser also.</li>
    <li> Happy with this Four Thieves essential oil blend, recommend it to others.  Manufacturer Edens Garden is top quality.</li>
    <li> I love this blend, it smells amazing and works well as a natural mouth wash (diluted of course.) High quality and affordable, can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
    <li> Love having this blend in hand to fight off germs.</li>
    <li> It can&#x27;t explain how deep and real my love for this Four Thieves oil is. I will buy this over and over and over and over again. This is the best blend of Thieves/germ fighting oil I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product. Just as good as Young Living Oils without the giant price tag. I use it for cleaning around the house. Makes a great mouthwash and antibacterial soap. No chemicals. No toxins. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Been using it for a while now in an old thieves spray bottle.  Smells almost identical.  Seems to do the job in public bathrooms and work which was my main use. At this price I can make up spray bottles for the whole family and spray liberally! !!</li>
    <li> Good product. Would recommend!</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been using this to keep my invalid uncle cold/flu free this season and so far he hasn&#x27;t caught anything. I&#x27;ve also used it in some DIY cleaners to disinfect, along with hand soap and hand sanitizer. It&#x27;s been great!</li>
    <li> A co-worker of mine introduced me to this product especially during the winter months when my kids would bring home some of the school germs home.  I diffused this oil with almond oil and put under my kids&#x27; feet before bedtime.  When two of them got a cold one time, I just diffused this in our house, and rubbed the oil under their feet before bedtime.  The cold only lasted for 2 days, and none of us got sick after.  I still diffuse every day for at least 4 hours each time.  I love the scent of it too.  It smells like Christmas time at our house all the time.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> Smells just like young living. I use it for cleaning and on our feet if we get sick (diluted). I also use this for homemade hand sanitizers. Will never use BPA filled sanitizers again! Also, will not be using antibacterial soap!</li>
    <li> Must have to help fight the flu like symptoms going around.&lt;br /&gt;I would like to see this in the 30 ML option.</li>
    <li> just what I needed, worked great</li>
    <li> i always put it on at first signs of a cold and if someone in the household has a cold and so far I haven&#x27;t caught one!</li>
    <li> Essential oils are new for me, and I have found this to be a powerful antiviral remedy. I get sick easily and often, unfortunately. Rub this on the soles of your feet, and you have immune system support! I learned this is what the people in the Middle Ages used to protect themselves against the plague. The ones who stole from the dying people. Hence the name. I always wondered how they didn&#x27;t get sick!</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance.  It&#x27;s equally refreshing and rejuvenating, not to mention the immunity boost,  I keep a diffuser on my night stand.  It&#x27;s wonderful to both awake and retire with this scent nearby. It&#x27;s a fragrance I return to again an again.</li>
    <li> Love this blend! Works wonders during the winter months. Keeps the colds and flu at bay. Goes good with elderberry syrup.</li>
    <li> I have used young living oils and bought this because it was cheaper. Not even close to the same thing as what I am getting from young living. It tasted horrible!</li>
    <li> Love this oil blend!  It is so great for fighting sickness and infections.  Had an infection from hernia surgery, cleared it up with FourTheves oil and didn&#x27;t need to take antibiotics!</li>
    <li> Scrumptious smell and effective in the kids in good health (have used it so far for two months. Wish I would have known about it sooner.</li>
    <li> A must have for cold and flu season. I diffuse this for 10 mins each room in our house. (when no one is in the room)  Edens Garden has great oils are reasonable prices. I figure the other oil companies have so many other people to pay they have to charge more for theirs. I don&#x27;t see any difference between EG and other direct marketing companies oils.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product for price, quantity. and quality.  I have use the more expensive brand and I felt I never got enough to fill my needs.  I am happy with this product.</li>
    <li> This is very concentrated oil of great quality and have ordered it a few times</li>
    <li> Eden&#x27;s Garden makes great oils!  I use Thieves in my atomizer almost every day (especially in winter) to ward of germs and sickness.  This oil is a blessing!  I also use it in my kitchen cleaning products around the holidays, and it smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m please with the product.</li>
    <li> Great blend of oils that fight bacteria, viruses and other nasty airborne germs flying around. It would be wise to have it on hand to use for the upcoming cold and flu season. I use mine in an inhaler during trips outside my home. It is also good to diffuse into the air especially if there is someone who is ill in your home. It works great as a cleaner also to kill germs. I have bought several oils from Edens Gardens and have been very pleased with them all.</li>
    <li> What a wonderful, healing oil! I put about 5 drops into my oil diffuser (ZAQ Dew LiteMist Aromatherapy Essential Oil Diffuser) and let the cool, scented mist fill up my bedroom when I&#x27;m starting to feel sick or just need a soothing aroma. My husband loves the smell too &amp; we plan on buying a lot more Edens Garden blends!</li>
    <li> A very good essential oil.</li>
    <li> Fantastic.  Order came in good time, and the product is super.  I used it to deodorize my apartment, and it is simply great. It makes the air seem really clean. It has a strong smell of spices which I personally like. I feel calmer when I use this for the air.  I have not used it for cleaning, which I will do soon.</li>
    <li> It is a very important product for my wellbeing.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected.  Gives me a headache, hard to explain.  Others may like this one</li>
    <li> Love this blend, it&#x27;s a perfect blend for my meditations and I will definitely be purchasing it again and again</li>
    <li> I love the smell of cinnamon, cloves, eucalyptus, lemon and rosemary. I use this oil because I love the fragrance and I am banking on the properties it is claimed to have. I use a little with my toothpaste, a little mixed in my lotion and also use it as a fragrance oil in my oil warmer.</li>
    <li> My favorite therapeutic oil brand. :)</li>
    <li> Was so skeptical about this, but anytime I had started to feel a cold or sore throat come on, I used this in a diffuser overnight and woke up totally fine. My roommate had a bad cough and sore throat for a couple days that she had been treating with cold meds. After using this (diffusing) one night, and woke up feeling significantly better and coughed less during the night.</li>
    <li> I used this oil to infuse my epsom salts...I gave a bottle to my daughter to try...she wants more...I love the smell and ALL that it can do for you.&lt;br /&gt;I also mixed in some ground organic oatmeal and some vitamin c granules...she loves it! I love it!</li>
    <li> Great product and great price.</li>
    <li> Will buy again. Love it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product at unbeatable price , i&#x27;am very happy with the Quality &amp; value .</li>
    <li> Wonderful scent and have used this product in an oil diffuser. Looking forward to discover many other uses in my home during the fall and winter months for cleaning and better breathing, which these seasons bring upon us. Only using tiny drops, this product will last for some time.</li>
    <li> The product arrived as advertised and on time.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know enough about this to rate it.  I&#x27;m new to oils.</li>
    <li> We have been very pleased with each one of the 100% Therapeutic Oils we have ordered.  Edens Gardens is a very good offering&lt;br /&gt;and prices are much better for most people than several other brands.  Thank you for carrying these.  We will order again.</li>
    <li> This was a nice alternative to the yl theives, which in my opinion is too expensive to waste in the diffuser...this works nicely in its place! I&#x27;d order again!</li>
    <li> Used this for years during cold/flu season, works wonders. Everyone should stock this in their medicine cabinet !</li>
    <li> Have for those special crisis possibilities such as a plague break out.</li>
    <li> 5 stars for the past two years now. Great job Edens Garden. Great as a hand sanitizer or spray in back of throat to prevent sickness. 5-10 drops mixed with a base.</li>
    <li> Used on several clients during therapeutic massage. Days later they wanted to know what helped them and where they can purchase some.</li>
    <li> Long lasting , great product. This mix keeps the varmints away. No more spiders or webs.</li>
    <li> Really has been keeping our immune systems up to par. I use it in an oil diffuser, as a throat spray and even add a few drops to my dishwater.</li>
    <li> Great stocking stuffer idea.  Gift for anybody who is into being holistic, virus free, natural.</li>
    <li> Please! I need another order of the &#x27;Thieves&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;It is wonderful and the price is right. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I have an acquaintance who sells Young Living and raves about how wonderful their &amp;#34;Thieves&amp;#34; blend is for preventing illness during cold &amp; flu season. I was interested in trying it, but unwilling to pay YL&#x27;s outrageous prices. Found the reasonably priced Eden&#x27;s Garden through Amazon user reviews. The fragrance is delightful (cinnamon &amp; clove predominate). It&#x27;s a bit soon to tell if it lives up to all the germ-fighting legends I&#x27;ve heard about this oil blend, but I can say that November is nearly over and I have not yet suffered an intestinal virus. In recent years, contracting a debilitating intestinal virus before Thanksgiving has become something of an annual tradition for me, and I hope this product will help me break that tradition. I found recipes online for thieves-oil hand sanitizer and disinfecting spray, and have been using both regularly. So far so good!</li>
    <li> Great product, works wonders.</li>
    <li> I love this oil, I use it everyday to keep germs away!!!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  I diffuse it in my home and we all love it.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality oil. My mother-in-law who is a Young Living user couldn&#x27;t believe how much I didn&#x27;t have to spend for the exact same oil. I just ordered 5 other bottles from Edens Garden to use for aromatherapy massage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t let the lessor price deter you from buying this brand. You won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
    <li> I have been using this oil in my mix for my diffuser and it makes a wonderful mixture that fills the room. The sent lingers for days and I have received many compliments. Oil is of high quality packed and shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> Love this four thieves blend. We use this a lot in our household, especially when a virus is going around. Please know to use a carrier oil when using on the skin. Also smells good when used in a warmer.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my sister in law and she said it had a pleasant fragrance.</li>
    <li> This smells awful. Too strong, not a good or pure scent. When I diffuse it I can only run the diffuser for about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li> Use it almost every day.  I love this!</li>
    <li> wonderful oil at great price</li>
    <li> What a GREAT PRICE! Same quality as all the expensive ones! Shipping was fast even early!</li>
    <li> I use this in my steamer and vacuum.  It helps to keep the bacterial count down and as a plus, it smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> Excellent for adults but not for children under 10</li>
    <li> I used Four Thieves oil to help me get rid of allergies that I couldn&#x27;t get rid of. It really did help. I will continue to use it in the future.</li>
    <li> nice product and excellent service..</li>
    <li> I have never tried the famous Young Living Thieves Blend so cant really make a comparison. But so far this is good. Gives me a v caim feeling when i put a few drops in my diffuser before going to bed. Delivery was on time and package was in good shape. I will probably be ordering more soon!</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s all in head, but this stuff works. My daughter had pneumonia and every night I would rub this on the bottoms of her feet and chest if she got to coughing...... it worked! I put it on a cut on my finger and put a bandaid on it over night for two days, it healed right up. My wife mixes it equal parts with Extra Virgin Olive Oil. Don&#x27;t use it straight!!!! It burns like hell. And don&#x27;t use it on your face or lips!!!!!!! That will make the Pope cuss.</li>
    <li> The product was outstanding and I&#x27;ve completely enjoyed using it around my home.  Just amazing!</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  Quick mailing time! A pleasure to work with.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and came very fresh with excellent dates on packages.</li>
    <li> It speeds up my recovery time from the common cold.</li>
    <li> I love Edens Garden oils and this one in particular! I applied it undiluted (I think it recommends to dilute with a carrier oil) to the start of a cold sore &amp; it was GONE in a few days! Amazing!</li>
    <li> High quality and priced right.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because it&#x27;s very similar and a knock off of a Young Living Thieves essential oil for a fraction of the cost  I love the fragrance and use it in a roller ball blended with fractionated coconut oil.  Happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Great oils!  I think their potency is just as good as the higher priced oils!</li>
    <li> i swear by this product and I love this brand! While everyone at work was coming down with the flu this past winter, I barely got the sniffles!(I work in retail, in cosmetics aka hands on with customers!) I apply this morning and night with a carrier oil to the soles of my feet and if needed a few pats on the chest as well(plus I love the scent). clears up congestion, has prevented me from getting sick!  my husband and son have both developed a nasty cough recently I made them use it and they barely have any trace of the cold left! Plus how can you beat the price?! I use many products from Edens Garden! Great quality!!</li>
    <li> I got this after reading about how to make your own organic countertop cleaner spray on one of my gardening blogs.It was a lot less expensive than the article quoted, and does smell quite antiseptic! Love the story about how it was formulated.&lt;br /&gt;This is a good quality product with a great price. I&#x27;m just getting used to the pungent smell - but after all, it is supposed to be antiseptic!</li>
    <li> Smells great I love it.</li>
    <li> I love this blend.  I have multiple uses for it also, from using it in my diffuser to rubbing it on the soles of my feet.</li>
    <li> Love this one. I have tried do Terra as well and I really can&#x27;t tell a difference.  Tjis smells like Christmas to me and I add to my foot cream at night.  Can&#x27;t remember the last time I was sick, so seems to be working.</li>
    <li> Smells great, I rub it my forearms in the morning and night. Its doing its job</li>
    <li> Came at a perfect time.  I have sprayed for colds and allergy infections.  I feel like it has helped us to get better sooner.  And it smells nice.</li>
    <li> I use this instead of &amp;#34;OnGuard&amp;#34;.  It&#x27;s much more concentrated and I love Edens Garden products.  I use this in almost every room of my house.  Especially during the holidays and when we have company (this is when everyone gets sick).  I have not had any sickness yet this year.  Great way to protect your house from nasty germs!  I use sonic diffuser and it works awesome with it.  GREAT product!</li>
    <li> TY for such a good alternative for disinfecting my poor ecxzema fingers.  Soap products destroy the already suffering skin.  I love the clove but it is a very strong fragrance that others don&#x27;t appreciate.  This is a gr8 product for me tho!!</li>
    <li> I love Edens Garden essential oils.  Four Thieves is a wonderful blend I use on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product!!!!</li>
    <li> Great quality! Love this oil.</li>
    <li> Wonderful blend of high quality oils</li>
    <li> Awesome deal ILO YL and DT. I got hooked on oils through YL and read a lot about Eden&#x27;s Garden b/c I was psyched out from the YL fans. Glad I did my hw, I order everything from them now and use EG oils daily at a fraction of the cost with the same quality. Also, their customer service is outstanding.</li>
    <li> the smell was pleasant and not offensive</li>
    <li> Just got this oil today..and I&#x27;m enjoying it in my new ZAQ Dew Litemist diffuser!  First time i have tried any of the &amp;#34;Thieves&amp;#34; oils..but I feel confident that the one I decided on from Edans Gardens is the best choice both economically, and quality wise.  I did a lot of research on all the top competitors like Young Living, and DoTerra, evan Rockymountain, and others.  By far the best price with at least the same quality oils if not better!  Super fast shipping to boot!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve even using this product for past 3 months. It came with a list of uses &amp; it&#x27;s been effective for cleaning, disinfecting.&lt;br /&gt;Love the smell. This is a keeper</li>
    <li> I use this as a healing oil on parts of the body that are hurting, like on my lower back, twice a day.  It really helps.  Something amazing that Thieve&#x27;s Oil did.  I had some swollen spider veins on the side of my leg near my knee.  That area hurt so bad that at times, I would put on an Ace bandage to try to make the pain less.  After using Thieve&#x27;s Oil on that area twice a day for about a week, I noticed improvement in the looks as well as the pain and swelling.  I&#x27;ve been using it on that area now for about a month, and there&#x27;s hardly a trace of the spider veins, and it doesn&#x27;t hurt and there&#x27;s no more swelling.  It&#x27;s a miracle!</li>
    <li> Love this blend of EO. It smells great. I use it mixed with some Argan Oil. I place some behind my ears , my chest and the bottoms of my feet before bed.&lt;br /&gt;I had been sick 3 times in a row with respiratory problems. I wanted something to help me to prevent further problems .&lt;br /&gt;I wash my hands frequently, try not to touch my face.&lt;br /&gt;I have a spray of this in distilled water that I spray all over the house.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter started using it on my grandson who was bringing home all sorts of illness from school.&lt;br /&gt;We are trying everything we can and are hopeful.</li>
    <li> From what I can tell this is good stuff.  I have not used other companies &amp;#34;Thieves&amp;#34;, but I think this has a nice odor.  I use it in homemade cleaner, I diffuse it to prevent airborne ickies, and also use in a carrier oil on my feet when I am feeling like I might be coming down with something.</li>
    <li> Not at all like thieves from young living. It&#x27;s more eucalyptus for sure. It&#x27;s probably not bad oil.  Just the mix is nowhere near like young livings theives.</li>
    <li> Edens Garden is a wonderful company, and this oil doesn&#x27;t disappoint. Don&#x27;t let the lower price deter you, the oils being sold by the multi-level marketing organizations (DoTerra, Young Living) are marked up so that they can pay commissions. Essential oils don&#x27;t have to cost a fortune to be effective. We diffuse Thieves oil in our kitchen and bedrooms, and put in roller bottles (purchased on Amazon) to put on the bottoms of our feet. Touch wood, we&#x27;ve made it until January without any illness this winter…I credit this oil!</li>
    <li> Wonderful blend!! I have already ordered more and others!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this oil! I diffuse it daily, it smells incredible. I will definitely be ordering this again.</li>
    <li> This is my first Essential Oil purchase.  The smell is wonderful.  I choose it over &amp;#34;Young Living&amp;#34; as I feel they are too pricey.  I will be purchasing other oils from this company.</li>
    <li> Edens Garden has done an exceptional blend on Four Thieves essential oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This size in 30 ml. is convenient and lasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four Thieves does an excellent job of supporting the immune system when applied properly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m  Very happy with this oil &amp; love the scent too, great size for the price and I will be order more  soon, thank you !</li>
    <li> I love this scent.  It&#x27;s spicy, warm and calming.</li>
    <li> an oil of many uses.  interesting history as well.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I will keep this in stock.</li>
    <li> Made hand soap with this. I love it.</li>
    <li> Usually order from this company and have been pleased with their service and products.</li>
    <li> This is a great oil and the right size for the price, I will buy again from Eden&#x27;s Garden, excellent company and great quality products. Thank you.</li>
    <li> My favorite of all. Great smell and product. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Did exactly expected and more.</li>
    <li> This particular blend has too much clove! The smell is so bad that I almost thought the oils were old and spoiled. The scent is so overpowering that I have to mix it with some sweet orange just to tolerate it. If you are looking for a good &amp;#34;Thieves&amp;#34; blend try Germ Fighter by plant therapy, it has a sweet cinnamon smell and works great! Very sorry I ventured out and tried this one it was an awful waste of money.</li>
    <li> Smells a lot like other brands of thieves but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as strong.  I found this out when using it in a diffuser.  Had been using it for a few weeks and then couldn&#x27;t find the bottle so I used my doterra equivalent-doterra was a LOT stronger.  So I&#x27;m not sure how it compares in terms of effectiveness if I could tell a difference in the strength of the smell.  I think to be on the safe side this cold and flu season I&#x27;ll go back to doterra or  young living, which is a bummer since this brand is easily half price the other brands.</li>
    <li> Love the product, love the price!</li>
    <li> I have been rubbing a couple of drops with coconut oil on my feet at night.  The main thing that I have noticed, it has helped with my dry mouth.  It has not completely relieved it but even a little relief is great!</li>
    <li> I love, love , love this blend of oils. It&#x27;s got a cinnamon smell with other spices I enjoy it is also a great blend for disinfecting the air, breathing  and even mouth washing with one drop in a glass of water. It kills bacteria and so much more. I use it and will never be without it in the house. Eden Garden has great customer service, my oil had spilled from the bottled and they sent me a new one right away.</li>
    <li> Great steam bath oil.  Use it all the time!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted. Will order again from this company. Thank you</li>
    <li> Nice size for the price</li>
    <li> Love this!! Use it allll the time!</li>
    <li> Awesome, quality product. Stopped my daughters cough on contact. Helped my Mom with her cough as well. Great when used as an air freshener as well. Love it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is very strong - not as strong as Young Living but it is strong. Too strong for me - I tried to ingest it - one drop in a glass of water and my throat is still sore after about a week. Tried to use it as cologne but it just didn&#x27;t agree with me.</li>
    <li> This is a great alternative to YL at 1/4 the cost! quality oils !</li>
    <li> Absolutely love the smell of this oil, which I diffuse.  At first I only used it when I didn&#x27;t feel well, but now I just use it because I like it so well!</li>
    <li> Love my 4 Thieves and I tell everybody about this.  It is great for cleaning, using in my natural hand sanitizer and a few drops in the laundry. It has multiple uses.  I love my essential oils!</li>
    <li> Great!!! Bought 2 bottles last time I ordered. Great to have on hand. Quick delivery.</li>
    <li> This is my FAVORITE essential oil EVER.  The scent is simply amazing, earthy, and warm.  I diffuse it in my room, as well as make bathroom and kitchen cleaners with it.  Simply DELICIOUS!!</li>
    <li> Really love the wonderful smell of this one. Edens Garden oils always come quickly. I am impressed with the quality for the price of their EO&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Smells a little different than YL&#x27;s similar blend, but seems good quality.</li>
    <li> The smell is amazing I use it for my kids to help keep them from catching colds</li>
    <li> Nice aroma - get compliments at work with its scent when using it in a diffuser - also use a drop on soles of feet at night when colds flying around the office - Hope it works to prevent winter colds and flu, but either way very pleasant scent. The company has wonderful customer service also - you can ask them any questions and get a quick response - Last year  was just trying the product and purchased the 10cc, This year bought the larger 30cc to use at home and work. The company website is now offering free shipping over $50. Quality products!</li>
    <li> Love this oil! I usually purchase Young Living oils and found this to be a much less expensive but effective alternative!</li>
    <li> I use this in a diffuser twice a day...at least.  It is good for so many things.</li>
    <li> very good. Have used several times</li>
    <li> These oils by Eden&#x27;s Garden are not the least bit inferior to doTerra, Melaleuca, or Young Living. I say this because for most essential oil users, quality and purity is a concern, and many are under the impression that you can only get the best by joining an MLM. Many of the praises for Eden’s Garden come from current and / or former DT, Melaleuca, and YL customers. We have also used virtually every MLM essential oil brand known to man, and this is right up there with the best of them in quality and purity, at a fraction of the price. The reason it is a fraction of the price is because it does not have about 3 to 5 levels of compensations for its representatives built into the margins, which drastically reduces the overhead. That is why many former MLM essential oil distributors who still want to use a great product yet can’t afford the network marketing prices and aren’t making any money with them have tried and like Eden’s Garden. From my experience, and countless other essential oil enthusiasts who have also used doTerra, YL, and Melaleuca, there is no difference in quality, purity or smell with Eden’s Garden. If you are one of the 1 - 5% making great money with an MLM, more power to you! But for everyone else, this oil matches up well with the best of them.</li>
    <li> Use this oil about everyday.</li>
    <li> I work in a clinic and I am around sick people all the time. I&#x27;ve started using the blend on my feet and my son&#x27;s . So far so good!!! I haven&#x27;t been sick besides having my coworkers coughing on my face all day long :)</li>
    <li> I diffuse this oil into the air and put it on tissues when I go out and I believe it has helped me to keep from getting sick this year. Phyl p</li>
    <li> Love this just as much as the MUCH MORE expensive brand I have used in the past. I&#x27;ve told everyone that will listen. Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> Thank you for going out of your way to send my shipment to the correct address!  Great product.</li>
    <li> I love the clean smell of this oil! It makes a great air freshener. I like to use it in my hair routine and body massage as well. I will definitely be a returning Edens Gardens customer!</li>
    <li> Good stuff . I used it all winter on my grandsons feet along with breathe easier and have had minimal issues with illness this season . 😍</li>
