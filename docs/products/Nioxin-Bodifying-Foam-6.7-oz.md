      <li>I have really fine hair, and I don&#x27;t like sticky mousse.  </li>
      <li>This product works wonders at adding body to my fine, thinning hair.  </li>
      <li>My hair is fine and the product didnt fill expectations</li>

      <li>Light and airy, doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down, but gives you loads of volume without having to use a lot.</li>
      <li>Leaves hair look natural.</li>
      <li>This new formula is not nearly as good as the old one - it doesn&#x27;t hold at all - Drug Store Mousse is better</li>
      <li>I know of no other that provides the body and thickness that this gives my hair.</li>

    <li> I was disappointed in this product. I use the Nioxin shampoo and conditioner and I am very happy with them. So I decided to try this. It did not appear to give any lift or thickness to my hair.  I have tried it several times with the same result.  Unfortunately, for me it did not work well.  I would not order it again. I have thinning hair and losing it daily.  I needed some more body and volumn. I do use other products  for volumizing and body that I am happy with.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Works great</li>
    <li> My hair is fine and the product didnt fill expectations</li>
    <li> help me a lot with my hair loose problem,</li>

    <li> Light and holds beautifullly!  LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just okay.  It volumes just fine, but I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s any better than a lot of other volumizers.</li>
    <li> Love Nioxin products.</li>
    <li> This product works wonders at adding body to my fine, thinning hair.  Holds wonderfully</li>
