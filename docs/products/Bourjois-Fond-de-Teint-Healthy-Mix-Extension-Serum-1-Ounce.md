      <li>I heard so many great reviews about this foundation and they are so true!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very light coverage foundation.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>It feels great on the skin, very lightweight.</li>
      <li>so much better than</li>
      <li>I love its texture which is gel based</li>
      <li>I thought that since it&#x27;s winter it&#x27;d be okay since I&#x27;m not as tan as during the summer.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very hydrating and leaves a dewy finish which is great for drier skin.</li>
      <li>I love the coverage.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love the smell too.</li>
      <li>It evens out my skin tone as best as a sheer coverage foundation can.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m okay with it.</li>
      <li>Love this foundation.</li>
      <li>Overall great product, way better than my MAC.</li>
      <li>It has a light floral scent and settles semi matte.</li>
      <li>If your skin is smooth it should apply on like a dream.</li>
      <li>and it glides on smoothly on to skin.</li>
      <li>The texture is light and is almost undetectable on the skin.</li>
      <li>It is a light coverage.</li>
      <li>No. 52 Vanille, which was way too light for me.</li>
      <li>I am very fair skinned and also very sensitive skin, that is why I bought this because its formulated for sensitive skin, but I did not care for this at all.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s super light</li>
      <li>At first I thought I should get the lightest shade, but this Vanille one is perfect for my slightly sun-kissed skin.</li>
      <li>The best foundation for normal to dry skin.</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;m sure this will be perfect for the winter months especially with how dry my skin gets.</li>
      <li>Love this foundation, it really makes my skin glow</li>
      <li>You have to layer it on for full coverage.</li>
      <li>Now it won&#x27;t cover all your scars, but it&#x27;s fine with me because I like a more natural look, I just want it to even out my skin tone.</li>
      <li>It feels more high end than the price tag suggests.</li>
      <li>Very pretty foundation</li>
      <li>Great for very dry skin, this foundation sets really well.</li>
      <li>Overall a good choice for someone looking for a light but buidable coverage foundation that feels natural.</li>
      <li>dunno, my honest opinion is you can find the same type of quality in the drugstores in the US.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the only silicon foundation I have ever liked.</li>
      <li>I have extremely red cheeks, and they flare when I&#x27;m stressed or warm.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say this could work for all skin types, but it is great for normal to dry skin.</li>
      <li>She raved about it, and she was exactly right.</li>
      <li>Now the skin tone is tricky as asian&#x3D;yellow, I choose this serum rather than foundation because many review said it was more yellow while the Foundation is more pink.</li>
      <li>is you have rather light yellow toned skin but not like the caucasian fair white.</li>
      <li>I have mild rosacea and this makeup helps to hide that very well.</li>
      <li>I like for my makeup to be daytime appropriate, but to also last a while.</li>
      <li>Exact dupe for MAC&#x27;s Mineralized Skinfinish, but without the harmful chemicals that cause me to breakout...</li>
      <li>I only wish it was available in the states!</li>
      <li>I would recommend this foundation to those who wants a light, natural coverage.</li>
      <li>Very dewy and pretty.</li>
      <li>I also wear it over the 100 percent pure luminous primer which really gives it a glowy finish as opposed to the &amp;#34;semi-matte&amp;#34; finish.</li>
      <li>Its very moisturizing and non cakey.</li>
      <li>I think thats really the purpose of this serum, to even out the skin tone, not as much for coverage.</li>
      <li>This shade was a bit light for me, next time I&#x27;ll be getting the shade 53.</li>
      <li>haha</li>
      <li>It has a subtle fragrance that is refreshing and it feels light on your face.  </li>
      <li>However I found that it settles into fine lines and does not stay on long, maybe 2 or three hours.</li>
      <li>The color match is decent (I chose 52 Vanille for my NC25 skin-tone).</li>
      <li>This really hydrates my super dry skin.</li>
      <li>/&gt;First of all this foundation has an amazing texture, not too watery not too thick.</li>
      <li>Looks very natural.</li>
      <li>The coverage is buildable, I did find that it&#x27;s a little more neutral than yellow based</li>
      <li>Pleasantly surprised  when it showed up in 1.5 week.</li>
      <li>It lasts a while and hasn&#x27;t caused my sensitive skin to break out.</li>

<li> However if you have some dry skin like it will somewhat cling on.</li>

<li> and it does give you a slight white cast.</li>
<li> I definitely recommend this as an everyday wear.</li>
<li> any other store bought foundation.</li>
<li> This does not give me an orange face like a lot of other foundations</li>
<li> Now the color is just a little off because I&#x27;m tanned at the moment.</li>
<li> However I did notice a bit of oxidation by the end of the day and the foundation turned a little orange.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s very subtle but grapefruity.</li>
<li> obsessed with the satin skin like finish, and smell.</li>
<li> I wanted this product so badly I just went for it.</li>

    <li> Very good foundation. It feels more high end than the price tag suggests. The texture is light and is almost undetectable on the skin. The color match is decent (I chose 52 Vanille for my NC25 skin-tone). However I did notice a bit of oxidation by the end of the day and the foundation turned a little orange. Overall a good choice for someone looking for a light but buidable coverage foundation that feels natural.</li>
    <li> Very nice foundation. Evens out skin tone nicely. Last all day. Applies well with a beauty sponge.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Asian and my skin tone is about a beige around there with medium beige being too tan for me though. I ordered the shade No. 52 Vanille, which was way too light for me. I thought that since it&#x27;s winter it&#x27;d be okay since I&#x27;m not as tan as during the summer. However, I still do like the foundation. It is a light coverage. I would recommend this foundation to those who wants a light, natural coverage. It creates this sheen and luminous glow on the skin.</li>
    <li> Very pretty foundation and it smells great. Very dewy and pretty.</li>
    <li> Great for very dry skin, this foundation sets really well. The coverage is buildable, I did find that it&#x27;s a little more neutral than yellow based and it does give you a slight white cast. I bought the shade 52 and if you wear Mac Mineralize Foundation in NC25 you may have to go with shade 53 instead. This shade was a bit light for me, next time I&#x27;ll be getting the shade 53. Overall great product, way better than my MAC.</li>
    <li> I purchased this on line after watching a youtuber use this. I dunno, my honest opinion is you can find the same type of quality in the drugstores in the US. It&#x27;s a very light coverage foundation. You have to layer it on for full coverage. I wasn&#x27;t really impressed with this product as much as I was with their eyeliner.</li>
    <li> obsessed with the satin skin like finish, and smell. I have been using this every day since I got it.</li>
    <li> I love the coverage. It has a light floral scent and settles semi matte.</li>
    <li> This really hydrates my super dry skin. Color match was perfect and I love the way it smells.</li>
    <li> awesomee, not cakey and smells greatt!! so much better than any other store bought foundation. Lasts a long time, would repurchase!</li>
    <li> I work the good ol&#x27; 8-5 business hours. I like for my makeup to be daytime appropriate, but to also last a while. This foundation is great. It&#x27;s the only silicon foundation I have ever liked. It evens out my skin tone as best as a sheer coverage foundation can. I have extremely red cheeks, and they flare when I&#x27;m stressed or warm. This foundation can&#x27;t cover that, but it doesn&#x27;t claim to so I&#x27;m okay with it. At first I thought I should get the lightest shade, but this Vanille one is perfect for my slightly sun-kissed skin. It lasts a while and hasn&#x27;t caused my sensitive skin to break out. I&#x27;ve applied it with a kabuki brush, with a beauty blender, and with my fingers. It&#x27;s beautiful with all three application techniques. I definitely recommend this as an everyday wear. I also wear it over the 100 percent pure luminous primer which really gives it a glowy finish as opposed to the &amp;#34;semi-matte&amp;#34; finish. I also powder it with a physician&#x27;s formula translucent mineral powder to help it last longer and to give my face some SPF.</li>
    <li> Love this foundation.</li>
    <li> I have really tricky skin, I have slightly darker face than I do my neck and rest of body, I have rather pale skin  and I tend to have problem areas.&lt;br /&gt;First of all this foundation has an amazing texture, not too watery not too thick. If your skin is smooth it should apply on like a dream. However if you have some dry skin like it will somewhat cling on. Now it won&#x27;t cover all your scars, but it&#x27;s fine with me because I like a more natural look, I just want it to even out my skin tone. I think thats really the purpose of this serum, to even out the skin tone, not as much for coverage. Now the skin tone is tricky as asian&#x3D;yellow, I choose this serum rather than foundation because many review said it was more yellow while the Foundation is more pink. I concur that this foundation is yellow, but still not quite yellow enough haha (man my skin is too yellow). when it sets in vanilla in 52 is a workable shade for me, maybe a tinge darker than i prefer. I would definitely buy this is you have rather light yellow toned skin but not like the caucasian fair white. I don&#x27;t believe this formula oxidizes.</li>
    <li> This foundation gives you a beautiful dewy finish with light to medium coverage.  I set it with a translucent powder and it last all day.  I am a NC20/NW20 and I ordered shade Vanilla 51 and it matches my skin perfectly.  Truly a great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> The best foundation for normal to dry skin. Leaves a dewy feeling when applied. I love it</li>
    <li> I love its texture which is gel based and it glides on smoothly on to skin. However I found that it settles into fine lines and does not stay on long, maybe 2 or three hours. If i mix it with my other foundations, it does improve the lasting power and application, but by itself its not much of a foundation. I am very fair skinned and also very sensitive skin, that is why I bought this because its formulated for sensitive skin, but I did not care for this at all.</li>
    <li> I heard so many great reviews about this foundation and they are so true! It feels great on the skin, very lightweight. I definitely think it benefits the skin as well. It felt smoother and softer. I absolutely love the smell too. It&#x27;s very subtle but grapefruity. Now the color is just a little off because I&#x27;m tanned at the moment. But I&#x27;m sure this will be perfect for the winter months especially with how dry my skin gets. I&#x27;d say this could work for all skin types, but it is great for normal to dry skin. It doesn&#x27;t cake up when built up and doesn&#x27;t cling on to any of my&lt;br /&gt;dry patches. The coverage is light/medium. Looks very natural. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> Love this foundation, it really makes my skin glow, it&#x27;s super light and I don&#x27;t even feel it on my skin during the day</li>
    <li> When I first ordered shipping timesaid at least a month! I wanted this product so badly I just went for it. Pleasantly surprised  when it showed up in 1.5 week. Cant wait to try! Heard great reviews of this product. Swatchedit perfect match!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!!  It has a subtle fragrance that is refreshing and it feels light on your face.  GREAT product!</li>
    <li> A great foundation! Exact dupe for MAC&#x27;s Mineralized Skinfinish, but without the harmful chemicals that cause me to breakout...I only wish it was available in the states!</li>
    <li> I bought this foundation after seeing it reviewed from youtuber, KathleenLights. She raved about it, and she was exactly right. It&#x27;s very hydrating and leaves a dewy finish which is great for drier skin. I would say the coverage is medium, but definitely buildable and you can&#x27;t beat the price. It did take a bit of time to get to me, but understandable since it&#x27;s a european product. I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling to find a foundation that is yellow tinted. This one is it! This does not give me an orange face like a lot of other foundations do. I have mild rosacea and this makeup helps to hide that very well. Its very moisturizing and non cakey.</li>
    <li> This foundation exceeded my expectations! It applies like silk and sets beautifully on the face. I would buy 1 million bottles if I could!!!</li>
