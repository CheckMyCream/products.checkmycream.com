<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this curling iron because I have a new cut that it easy to dress up with a few extra curls.  My hair has always been difficult to curl because it has lots of body and natural waves that insist on having their own way, but those waves don&#x27;t look all that great if left without styling.  I have a curling wand, but I found it difficult to operate.  I decided to plunge back into curling iron land, and after some research, I chose this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Infiniti Pro heats up quickly.  I love that I can choose the temperature setting, although I wish I knew when it reached it.  I also tend to use a protective glove on one hand because I burned myself when I tried to guide the wand at both ends.  I like to section my hair and place it on the wand before I clip it -- and doing that makes burns inevitable.  The clip can create kinks at the end; if that happens to you, try styling without closing it (and using a glove) as though it were a styling wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this curling iron a lot more than my old one and even my styling wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With my hair, the 3/4&amp;#34; wand creates 1.5&amp;#34; or greater curls because my hair relaxes immediately after I release it.  I&#x27;m considering using some kind of heat protection treatment as well since my hair can get frizzy from the heat.</li>
    <li> I already had this curler in the 1&amp;#34; size. That one is great for big, soft curls. But some sections of my hair are very stubborn and don&#x27;t like to curl or stayed curled. I also sometimes wanted a more pronounced curl. The 3/4 inch was the perfect diameter to get the fun, bouncy curls I wanted for some looks. The curl lasts for days! With no product - just my hair and this curler. Which is saying something as my baby fine hair is very hard to curl. A tip to getting curls that last without product - mist your hair with water before curling. I learned that trick from a Conair steam iron I owned years ago - it was the first curling iron that gave me curls that lasted. Sadly, mine succumbed to mineral deposits clogging the water line and they don&#x27;t seem to make the steam irons anymore. Misting your hair works nearly as well though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My original foray into ceramic irons was years ago when they first hit the major chains and only plain ceramic was available. The plain ceramic was far too rough for my fine hair. My hair would cling to it and break, so I went back to the metal ones that left me with flyaways and lots of split ends. Then I read about tourmaline ceramic. Seemed to be an improvement over the ones I used in the past, so I purchased the Revlon tourmaline curler in the 1&amp;#34;. Loved the tourmaline, hated the curler. The tourmaline worked great to smooth my frizz gently and make my hair shine; however, the curler kept shutting off on me while I was trying to curl my hair and the clamp cover fell off after a couple weeks of use. The cover I just glued it back on, but I could not get the iron to stay on for a whole curling session. I have loved previous Conair items I have used, so I decided to give their tourmaline a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The tourmaline finish wasn&#x27;t as smooth as the Revlon finish, but it doesn&#x27;t tear my hair like the plain ceramic curlers, so it&#x27;s still a win.&lt;br /&gt;*The heat STAYED ON!!&lt;br /&gt;*The curl lasted longer than the Revlon curler.&lt;br /&gt;*I like the heating controls a lot better on the Conair. You can choose the actual Fahrenheit temperature (who knows what 22 actually is?).&lt;br /&gt;*The barrel cover they include with this curler is also a big plus - solid and easy to put on.&lt;br /&gt;*Another plus is the tab counter stand - nothing for your hair to get hung up on and nothing to manage before putting the iron down.&lt;br /&gt;*The cord is quality; it swivels easily and doesn&#x27;t twist into a knot (the Revlon one did - hard to curl when you&#x27;re fighting a cord).</li>
    <li> Ive had two of these, and they are one of the best irons on market. I don&#x27;t use it much now that my hairstyle changed.</li>
    <li> This heats quickly and evenly. I like the different temperature settings. It leaves soft, defined curls that lasted all night (A real feat since my hair generally falls flat within a few minutes of curling it). I was even able to wear a slightly wavy style the next day! A great deal, especially considering the price. The sleeve that is provided to put the hot iron in is handy since you don&#x27;t have to leave it out forever and wait for it to cool. I do wish that the little prong that the iron rests on were a bit larger. Otherwise, no complaints.</li>
    <li> perfect size for medium to short hair.  Heats up very quickly.</li>
    <li> I kid you not. This curling iron is the best I have ever owned. Period! I have bought expensive curling irons that promised to do what this one does...and for less than $20. A diva must have!!!!</li>
    <li> According to my wife, her only complaint is the push button on/off swith is in a dumb position and constantly accidentally gets shut off during regular use. Other than that annoying attribute, the quality of contsruction is excellent and the speed and quality of curls is excellent. Would have been 5 stars if not for the switch.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price. I love that it heats up so fast and I have a choice of temperatures to choose from.</li>
    <li> I do really like this iron and the different heat controls make it better then any other I have owned but as stated by other reviews the on/off button is really in a bad place and as much as I try to be concious of it I usually do shut it off at least once while using it or more often.  The price here at Amazon cannot be beaten though. It is several dollars cheaper here then even at Walmart.</li>
    <li> I bought this curling iron for my wife and she loves it!! It has the 2 elements necessary for fine,thin hair (tourmaline and ceramic),is the correct diameter at .75 inches, and heats and cools exactly as described in the ad. This is a great buy at a great price!!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my new 3/4&amp;#34; infinity curling iron. I have had one of these before and seemed to be good quality.</li>
    <li> Love this curling iron. Good price and heats up instantly.  Gives a great curl and more body to hair style. The black tip helps prevent burning yourself as I have done often with my old one. Great value for the money.</li>
    <li> I was totally happy with this curling iron. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> This product is as described but with one possible exception. This thing heats up very, very hot even at the lowest temperature settling. My old iron is a Revlon and even at the highest settling does not come near the heat of the lowest setting on this one.</li>
    <li> ...curls every time. I have the same ceramic curling iron in a larger barrel and love it, so I decided this would be a good purchase, I was not disappointed! I love that it heats up in 30 seconds and also that you can choose the temp of the iron itself. The cord is plenty long enough and the protective cover that fits on the barrel after you&#x27;re done, is a great plus!! You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Consumer Reports ranks Infinity by Conair CD106 Professional Tourmaline Ceramic Curling Iron very highly, and I agree.  It is easy to use, heats quickly, makes your hair shine, and has a cover to protect the iron during storage.  The only disadvantage is the placement of the controls on the front of the handle, where they can be inadvertently shut off.</li>
    <li> Love this curling iron. Heats up fast. I saw people complaining  about the end cap being to small. I don&#x27;t see were this curling iron  is any different then any other iron design .You have to be careful. I have really fine,long,  hard to curl hair. This works really well. I like that the buttons for on/off  are not oversensitive. It hangs on well to the end of my hair with out me having to wrap the wispy  pieces around by hand. I have had many ,many curling irons and this is the best one yet. Very happy I bought it.</li>
    <li> Great product that works the best. It smooths as well as curls and the heat settings allow the curls to stay</li>
    <li> I am disappointed with this curling iron.  It is constantly turning off because  the button gets hit while holding the iron to curl your hair.  I tried a different curling iron while staying with a friend and had no such problem.</li>
    <li> I needed a curling iron that was 3/4&amp;#34; and was not able to find it in any of the stores. So again Amazon came through.  It&#x27;s perfect for the parts of my hair that are shorter and need curling.</li>
    <li> It feels cheap on the bottom half and handling is just so so, but it hold curls well late into the day (for me) and it doesn&#x27;t catch my hair like some do. I bought it for it&#x27;s shut off feature, which my hot tools that I love don&#x27;t have.</li>
    <li> I like the curler as it heats up very quickly and curls my hair nicely. The only problem is the switch! I do not get why they made the switch so flimsy and put the on/off switch together that you can easily press it off without knowing. Every time I curled my hair, I would accidentally turn it off and then have to set the degree level again annoying! Besides that still a good curler.</li>
    <li> This size works well for my shorter hair. It heats up quickly has auto shut off and holds hair well. Good curl and is a good weight and quality. Can&#x27;t go wrong wi th Conair.</li>
    <li> I have to use a curling iron all the time.  This one is great, does not burn your hair.</li>
    <li> I like this curling iron; however, the on/off switch is on the handle. I inadvertently turn it off numerous times each use, but now know to check after each curl.</li>
    <li> I loved this iron when it arrived. The price was right, it heated really fast, everything appealed about it. I used it less than two months, 10 times at most if that, and it quit heating on me. The light turns on, and that is about it. Now it is more than 30 days, I doubt I can return it. :(</li>
    <li> Heats quickly and curls last.</li>
    <li> My hair is already curly/wavy so I mostly use this for touch ups and it works great.  It heats up fast.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to damage my hair (I also use heat protecting spray beforehand), it has various heat settings, and the heat-proof case it comes with is reassuring when I have to run to work and it&#x27;s not totally cooled off yet.</li>
    <li> Makes awesome curls! Easy to use and i has multiple heat settings. Highly recommended. I have the this one and the 1 inch.,</li>
    <li> Works very well! Color is not actually as shiny as in the picture but that&#x27;s alright. I&#x27;m glad it has a sort of built-in way to prop it up (my last one had a wire that would always slip!)</li>
    <li> This product came in a different color than shown in the picture.  The handle coating is sticky and it turns off randomly while IN use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I own this same iron, just in two other sizes.  Greatly disappointed...</li>
    <li> This is one curling iron I really like. Heats quickly and handles great. Can choose a cooler temp. Would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Really like this curling iron. Two issues : have to hit on button win you plug in. Cuts itself off in an hour --often go back to finish and it&#x27;s cut off. Fortunately it doesn&#x27;t take long to reheat</li>
    <li> This is an awesome curling iron, which heats up super fast and even across the entire curling surface (no hot spots).  The multi-heat settings and LCD readout are also clever and very useful features as well.  The cost is amazing and the shipping from Amazon couldn&#x27;t be faster!  So, with all of these raves, why do I not give it a perfect 5 star rating?  Well, two minor quibles keep me from giving it a perfect score.  First of all, the LCD panel displays the temperature setting that you selected, but it gives you no indication of when the iron has been heated to that setting.  There should be some sort of visible notification to let the user know that the iron has achieved the desired temperature.  Also, included in the box is a clever slip on cover that you can supposedly slide over the iron, after it has been shut off, to protect you from the hot surface of the slowly cooling iron.  However, the slip on sleeve becomes extremely hot to the touch, so it offers very little protection.  And since the cover is plastic I am afraid that it could possibly melt and/or cause some damage to the iron surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think this curling iron deserves a solid 4 and 1/2 stars, but falls short of a perfect 5.  I feel very confident in recommending it to anyone looking for a high quality iron that will meet or exceed their expectations.  This iron is a top performer with just a couple of little shortcomings.</li>
    <li> I have a large barrel curling iron but I wanted to get something smaller for my bangs once I got a new haircut. This iron is great for the price. My favorite things about it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--You can control the heat setting, and there are several heat options&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--It heats up very quickly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--The cord swivels at the base of the iron, which means you can position the cord so that the iron won&#x27;t get knocked over&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--The iron comes with a barrel cover - when you&#x27;re done using it, you can just cover the barrel and not have to worry about accidentally touching it while it&#x27;s still hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only bad thing is that you there&#x27;s no indication when the iron has reached the desired temperature setting. But the positives far outweigh the negatives.</li>
    <li> My findings after using this curling iron are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1) Really beautiful curls.&lt;br /&gt;2) Heats up easily as stated.&lt;br /&gt;3) Easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;4) Hair glides easily when release.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1) Curls doesn&#x27;t last long till the end of the day. It turns into more of a big waves.&lt;br /&gt;2) Stated 120V. My circuit is 240V. Therefore, I have to use a power converter/adapter to use this, which I do not mind as I have done this with my many other electrical items before. However, it doesn&#x27;t heated up at all. Even if I let it for more than 10 minutes with the highest temperature, it still doesn&#x27;t heat up. So, I try without using power converter/adapter instead. Funny, it works as stated. So does this really a 120V or 240V?</li>
    <li> Got this curling iron a few weeks ago, and it&#x27;s very lite.  Decent sized cord.  Quick heat-up.  Easy to handle, other than the placement of the On/Off button.</li>
    <li> I am a novice hair-curler at best, but from my first use with this iron I&#x27;ve had only good experiences. It grips my fine hair perfectly and makes great curls that last all day. I haven&#x27;t had any issue with accidentally turning it off or changing the heat setting. The tip is a nice size for gripping. I was surprised to get such a high-quality curling iron for such a low price!</li>
    <li> This is the best curling iron I have ever owned. Have short hair and need this to add some body for hairstyles.</li>
    <li> I have ultra straight superfine short hair which is very difficult to curl.  I have always had to use hairspray first and then the curling iron. This curling iron curled it instantly without any products whatsoever and left it shinier, softer and without any frizz at all.  I am in shock.  I had no idea tourmaline was out there until my daughter bought one.  I guess I am probably late to the party on this but am so happy to have found it at last.  If you have superfine. straight hard-to-curl hair you owe it to yourself to try it!! You&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
    <li> This is my umpteenth curling iron and I have had it about a month. I absolutely love it. It has a whole range of heat options and creates better curls than my previous one. Seems to be made well and the controls are positioned so they don&#x27;t get in the way like some. The cord is study so it won&#x27;t twist and wear through like some I&#x27;ve had in the past. Hope it holds up a long time!</li>
    <li> I find the Conair Tourmaline Ceramic Curling irons to be very gentle on thinning, delicate hair; no pulling or extremely hot temperature to frizz the hair. I have these curling irons in several sizes. This model has an easy to see and manipulate temperature control.</li>
    <li> No matter what size rod you buy, I think this is the best curling iron.  I read complaints about the placement of the temperature controls...I don&#x27;t find it a problem in the least, and would ask those people to come up with a better place.  It&#x27;s convenient, and I don&#x27;t find an issues with hitting it accidentally.  I like the type of material that is used on the rod much better than the previous chrome rod that I had (same brand) and happy that they made the change for my hair&#x27;s sake.</li>
    <li> The Infiniti Pro is great with so many temperatures to choose from depending on hair so no possibility of burning or drying your hair  while using it. I&#x27;m very pleased with the Infiniti Pro.</li>
    <li> Best iron I have every used.  Couldn&#x27;f find it in stores when my first on finally broke after several years of use, so I have to order off line.</li>
    <li> This is an efficient hair curler!  Bought for trips.  Excellent in all ways!&lt;br /&gt;This is the second one that I have purchased.</li>
    <li> This iron is perfect for tight shirley temple curls.  The iron heats up fast and hair does not snag in the clips.  It came with a sleeve to store the iron in which I also use to protect my bathroom counter.  This is a steal for less than $20.</li>
    <li> Love this curling iron! Great for shorter hair if you want a beach wave look. Very high heat, do not need to curl hair long for curl to stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love all of the sizes of this curling iron!</li>
    <li> My old curling iron died and I purchased this one. Great purchase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick hair and it works really well.</li>
    <li> Still getting used to using something new, but size of barrel is perfect for keeping my curls lasting longer. I use the same product with different size barrel and this is why I bought the same brand</li>
    <li> I have been using the same Conair iron for years, it died, This one is the best ever ,heats fast, curls so easy, have had no problem with turning it off accidently. I&#x27;m so glad I chose to try the Conair Nano, great price, I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This is the best purchase I have made on the internet and I have made plenty.  I spent a lot of time researching and was going to go with a $100 curling iron for the brand name and I wanted the Nano Tourmaline Ceramic to see how it did with my hair.  I have thick somwhat curly hair and this works fantastic.  I only use on lowest heat and basically as soon as I wrap a strand of hair and pull out it is curled and the curls stay without hairspray!!  I cannot beleive the money I have spent on high priced items that sit in the drawer.  I bought that spiral looking curling iron (wasn&#x27;t cheap) and it I cannot use without burning both my hand and hair.  I live in a very humid state and this has eliminated frizz for me.  Well I use other products too but this iron is definetely part of my hair regimen from now on.  I cannot beleive what a great iron this is for the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have since ordered two more in different sizes :)</li>
    <li> I have used this curling iron before and this was a replacement.  It is an excellent product with 30 second heat-up time and on the first setting it curls my hair in 2-3 seconds.  I like the stand also as it doesn&#x27;t get in the way when using the curling iron like some with the wire stand.  The price was excellent as well.  I would recommend this product in whatever size rod you need to anyone using a curling iron.  The nonstick finish is the best I have ever encountered and if needed, it is very easy to just wipe off.  The protective shield is a plus when storing it after use.</li>
    <li> I have had the same Infiniti Pro Conair Nano Tourmaline Ceramic Curling iron for several years.  My &#x27;old&#x27; Infiniti Pro Conair&#x27;s performance was exemplary!  So it was a no-brainer to replace with a &#x27;new&#x27; curling iron of the same model.  I am not disappointed with my new iron!</li>
    <li> Three-quarter inch is a great size for shorter haircuts.  Lightweight, easy to use.  Curls even fine, hard-to-curl hair like mine.</li>
    <li> Have  used and wore out many curling irons over the years. The last three Revlon brand irons frayed at the swivel area after about a year exposing wire.  But all in all  pretty good performance other than that.&lt;br /&gt;After having the Infiniti Pro for three days, I am convinced it is the best iron I&#x27;ve ever used!  It heats up quickly and I&#x27;m using the next to lowest setting (my old iron had to be at the max hot temp to curl my very straight hair.)  I work in a nursery greenhouse with high humidity and my hair stays curled. Really like the design too.</li>
    <li> the barrel on this isn&#x27;t high enough to hold your hair. I was very disappointed when we first tried using this</li>
    <li> I had searched the metro area of Des Moines IA and could NOT find this curling iron anywhere.  Did a search on Amazon.com and there it was.  Price was perfect.  I ordered two and they were at my home in less time than was listed on my order.  Thank you for the great service!!!</li>
    <li> Fantastic curling iron!</li>
    <li> This heats up quickly, does not need an adjustable stand while heating, holds my short fine hair securely while curling.  I think the tourmaline ceramic surface is easier on my hair.</li>
    <li> This has so many settings, it is great.  The curls seem to stay longer with this iron, due to the high heat, which is my setting.  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> i love it when using it i feel very very good job do to my hair it very hetter in short time and have different heat I search more no the same price and very good job just i tell anyone paying its very good u must love it my hair normal and heavy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 67 have somewhat thin and fine white hair, permed, shoulder length.  Old curling irons left hair damaged at ends, dry, brittle, no shine.  This is the best curling iron I&#x27;ve used in many years.  I love that I can choose the heat setting, it has auto off, easy for my hands to manipulate.  My hair is shiny after curling and doesn&#x27;t seem so damaged by heat.  The curls stay in just fine with products I use (Kenra thermal styling spray, e.g.).  This was recommended in a Wall Street Journal article by the way.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a cheap replacement curling iron and this fits the bill perfectly. It heats very fast, auto shut-off is great.  My only complaint is that I sometimes accidentally hit the power button and shut it off without noticing.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a similar one that had stopped working - after many years of use. Very nice product &amp; works very well. The price is also very good.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my grand daughter she loves it.</li>
    <li> Great curling iron. I have had mine for several years and it is still going strong.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this iron!! I own many different curling irons and this is by far my favorite! I would definitely recommend this to others! you wont regret buying this.</li>
    <li> works well. great curls great heat</li>
    <li> Good curling iron came in damaged box but new and unused.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall happy with product.</li>
    <li> This is without a doubt the HOTTEST curling iron I have ever had, exactly what I wanted.  You have to use common sense and not leave the iron in long but do it quickly. It has about 4 temperature settings and I found out by experimenting No. 3 is hot enough! No. 4 will smoke your hair if you leave it in too long.  I literally saw vapor or smoke or something rise up off my hair just on No. 3, this iron reminds me of my beautician&#x27;s curling iron in the salon, super hot. Just use caution and common sense.  Definitely not for children to use unattended or for me on those days I am so clumsy, yes, I accidentally got it next to my neck and burned a little spot instantly.  So if you want a HOT iron, get this one, just BE CAREFUL!  It comes with a nice hard plastic sheath to put over the iron part when you&#x27;re done, great product, I have been hunting a hot one for years.  I had my beautician get me one from the beauty supply house once and she thoroughly grilled me on safety (like I am you), but that iron was a big disappointment.  It was only mediocre and didn&#x27;t get very hot at all.  I paid about $45 for it, and way less for this one by Conair.  I never dreamed I&#x27;d find the ideal one made by Conair, but it&#x27;s all I want now.</li>
    <li> Excellent curling iron with one slight flaw - the tip (front for holding) should be slightly larger. The ceramic iron itself is great.  The quickness of it actually heating up to maximum temperature is amazing and in itself certainly makes up for the little black thingy. Also considering I have used my previous 3/4\\&quot; curling iron for over 10 years (was certainly use to the long wait of heating it up), and NO I don&#x27;t expect this curling iron to last ten years.  Nothing manufactured now-a-days is made to last, lets face it, period. It is a nice little apparatus and worth the money.  It&#x27;s a keeper wiih me folks.</li>
    <li> Not sure about this curling iron. It&#x27;s true it&#x27;s hot even on med setting. It&#x27;s also true the tip gets hot and when I saw smoke coming from my hair I unplugged it. The last thing I need is burned hair and hands. Some may love it but I just don&#x27;t like being burned. I&#x27;ve been using curling irons for as long as they&#x27;ve been out so it&#x27;s not that I&#x27;m a novice. No iron needs to be 400 degrees. I didn&#x27;t set it on that because have you ever put your head in a 400 degree oven? If you get one use the low setting and don&#x27;t touch anything but the very tip.</li>
    <li> i love this curling iron....the only reason i didnt give it 5 stars is the end (tip) does not stay cool...it gets a bit warmish...but i love the control i have for curling or straighting my hair!!!</li>
    <li> Not as advertised..this unit is NOT DIGITAL..Returned and asked for the correct replacement, received identical item again..</li>
    <li> Love this product. I got curls with this curling iron that I couldn&#x27;t get with many others. Great price.</li>
    <li> Works beautifully, curls easily and hair is left smooth, shiny and frizz free.</li>
    <li> Great curling iron!!!</li>
    <li> Makes beautiful touchable curls for my short hair!</li>
    <li> Works greats and my curls last all day long.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m a guy and my hair usually looks smashed alot; so I bought the 3/4 inch one and it works great for short hair.</li>
    <li> Love the auto shut off and so does my husband.  I would always leave it on, and he would end up cutting it off.</li>
    <li> Great  curling iron,  Heats up very fast.  A friend borrowed it and then went out to ourchase it.  She said it was the best curling iron she ever had.  The price is good, too.</li>
    <li> This was my 2nd try at buying a curling iron.  going to stick with curling with my flat iron.  Too late to return</li>
    <li> Great curling iron. Only issue I found that it doesn&#x27;t turn it&#x27;s self off so you need to remember to turn it off.&lt;br /&gt;Heats up quickly and works well.</li>
    <li> After 30+ years of using curling irons, I can honestly say that I have tried numerous brands, sizes, types, etc., of available curling irons and have NEVER been as happy with any curling iron as I am with the Infiniti Professional Nano!  I actually ordered the 3/4 inch and the 1 1/2 inch and love, love, love them!  I have very long hair -- my hair is well more than halfway down my back -- and during the regular M-F work week, I typically curl my hair 3 out of 5 days.  The very first day that I switched over from my previous curling iron to using my new Infiniti 3/4 inch, within the first couple of hours of the day, three different people made comments along the lines of \\&quot;Oh, you curled your hair! Looks really great!\\&quot; etc.  Each time, I commented back, \\&quot;I&#x27;ve been curling my hair almost every day forever!\\&quot;  Then I would hear, \\&quot;Really?\\&quot;  That should tell you how well this iron curls and how well the curls hold up! I still have curl in my hair the next morning when I get up!  My 18 year old daughter borrowed my Infiniti and, after using it just once, has declared it the best curling iron she&#x27;s ever used -- now I&#x27;m ordering one for her too!</li>
    <li> Overall, a good product.  Heats very fast and gets very hot (you might want to pay attention to the instructions and the chart of heat settings for particular hair types - I started out too hot and had to take the temp down to medium for my fine gray hair).  Makes good curls in a short time. My only complaint is the power button.  I seem to turn it off several times while curling my hair.  It is very sensitive and easy to turn off and when it goes off and you turn it back on you have to reset the temperature again.  Kind of a pain but the product works well and the price isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
    <li> Best Curling Iron I have ever owned.  Love how fast I can get my hair looking great!!</li>
    <li> this is the perfect size for the in between curls, also easy to use, flexible temperatures, and great cover for travel and storage so I don&#x27;t scratch the barrel.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom for Christmas, and she absolutely loves it. She says it&#x27;s so much better than her traditional metal curling iron. She has burned her fingers on it a few times, though, so be careful.</li>
    <li> Love my curling iron, fast delivery😊</li>
    <li> It showed a pinkish color and it is black</li>
    <li> I really like it. Heats fast and shuts off if I forget to shut it off. Gives me the curl I want depending on how hot I have it and how long I do a curl though I don&#x27;t condone keeping a curler on one spot to long. You can burn your hair or damage it . My hair doesn&#x27;t stick to this one like my last one which I really like. keep it clean though.</li>
    <li> Needed for tight curls for long straight hair.  works well.</li>
    <li> This ConAir kind of curling irons is the only brand I&#x27;ll use.  Heats up quickly and evenly.  The ceramic leaves my hair shiny.</li>
    <li> Heats up super fast. Would have rated it 5 stars but the tip of the barrel is too small for fingers and have burnt myself several times.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it and if she is happy I am as well. The item came well packaged earlier than I thought it would. I recommend this to my friends and family. I have nothing to add at this time other than to say I would buy another one if need be.</li>
    <li> It is easy to use, heats up fast. I like it. 2</li>
    <li> My favorite curling iron.  I wish I would have found this curling iron years ago before wasting money trying so many wrong curling irons.  The cord Dona&#x27;s not tangled at all in the months I&#x27;ve been using it.  The heat is great and the ability to change the heat settings is very useful.  I love it.</li>
    <li> My wife seems to like this curling iron. We had to test and see if the auto shut-off worked, and it did.</li>
    <li> I now own 3 different sizes of the Infiniti Pro by Conair.  Love the Tourmaline Ceramic wand on my hair.  Hate the design of where the maker put the on/off and temperature switch.  It is very common for me to accidently turn off the curling iron while curling hair.  BUT, knowing this, I still bought 2 more sizes and still love the tourmaline wand part.</li>
    <li> Muy contenta con el producto, llevo usandolo varios meses y ha funcionado perfecto.</li>
