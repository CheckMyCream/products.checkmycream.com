<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have to say...I love this cream! I originally bought it because it was marked down in price, and contained aloe vera. What can I say? Like everyone else, I am always looking for a bargain! BUT-this cream has exceeded my expectations!!! I liked it so much I had my 17 yr old daughter try it, and made my husband slather it on too! My husband and daughter both have combination skin-and truth be told my husband uses NO products of any kind-he is such a man! But he tried it just to hush me up, but told me later that night and again in the morning-how nice the cream felt..it left no greasy or oily feel to it. My daughter told me the same thing the very next morning! I have combination to oily skin, with acne from time to time. I was pleasantly surprised at not only how it felt on my skin-but how refreshing it was too! My daughter thought it was refreshing and kind of tingly too. It absorbed very quickly and nicely...that IS saying alot from someone like me! I have tried lots and lots of other products (Mary Kay, Lancome, Este Lauder, Jane Iredale) over the years, but this is the first face cream I have ever fallen in love with! I will definitely continue to purchase this cream! Thanks for making a great product!</li>
    <li> It is a good moisturizer and gives my skin a natural glow.  It makes me look much younger!</li>
    <li> Works well; love aloe.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product!  It feels great and absorbs quickly leaving my skin moisturized and looking fabulous.  I will definitely continue to keep Cutis Vita in my repertoire.</li>
    <li> A waste of money, I bought this product because of the good reviews but it didn&#x27;t live up to the expectations or claimed. I guess those are fake reviews...this product leave whitish particles on your face and after applying it, your face would look very dull and repulsive...a coworker asked if I went on vacation to florida and in the sun because my face looked not ok.  I delayed to  request a refund mean while I stopped using it after a second application...I just let it sit there while the refund window closed!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about two years now and I have to say it is the best hydrating lotion/cream I have ever used! My favorite place to use it is on my face. I use it in the morning and in the evening because of its non-greasy qualities and it keeps my skin glowing. I highly recommend for its price, quality, and it goes a long way!</li>
    <li> I started using this product as soon as it arrived and I must say it is really great. Its not greasy but yet feels really great on the skin, It really moisturizer my skin. I would recommend this product and I will be reordering soon. Awesome product.</li>
    <li> I will not recommend you to use this if you have oily skin. Made my face break out.</li>
    <li> I love this cream. I am very picky about what I use, but after looking at the ingredients I thought I would give it a try. I patch tested it on my self and my kids--works well and moisturizes without leaving a greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> Very emollient - thick - nice and gentle for facial skin.  Beautiful scent.</li>
    <li> not moisturizing and don&#x27;t like smell only positive is it did not irritate my skin, even tried on my hands, and elbows which are less dry than my hands and no difference still no moisture</li>
    <li> The facial moisturizer is ok. I&#x27;ll keep it but will not buy it again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the product delivery is excellent!!!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t moisterize that well for me, unfortunately. I love the natural approach,  wanted to love thus, but results were just kinda blah.</li>
    <li> I love this product !! I think I finally found my fav cream</li>
    <li> This cream has a very pleasant natural smell. I love that it feels thick and creamy and then immediately soaks into my skin. It leaves my skin feeling hydrated but not oily. It definitely has been improving the look and feel of my skin since using it nightly the last couple weeks.</li>
    <li> Great cream and moisturizer.  It keeps my skin soft and helps with rejuvenation of my skin.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t comment a lot about it as I&#x27;ve only used it for 4 days now as I received it last week. It feel really good on my face so far, I&#x27;ll see as days go by what results it bring as I keep using it.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion I work at a hospital and wash my hands 1 billion times a day and you never know what after using this. I got some for a gift and now I&#x27;m just going to buy it for all my friends.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using my first jar of the cultis vita and have to say I really like this face cream. I was actually hoping it was going to have a strong lemon scent, but it is a neutral non scented cream scent. I like the way the cream applies to the face and how it feels on the face. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Cutis Vita absorbs quickly and last a long time!  Customer Service is wonderful!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this purchase.  Not only is the product great, but I also received my order a day early!  The product was exactly what I was looking for. My hands are dry year-round and this product really helped.  It made my skin feel much smoother and hydrated without feeling greasy or leaving a residue.  I am also huge on the way a product smells.  This product has a very light, fresh fragrance that doesn&#x27;t overwhelm.  Also, a little goes a long way.  Thanks!!</li>
    <li> This is a great cream for dry skin, it quickly soaks into the skin and leaves no greasy residue.  The sent is natural and clean. Love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over seven months now. For me, it has done some great things. This product has removed any sign of fine lines that were on my face. I was starting to get some on my forehead and around my chin but they&#x27;ve complete disappeared. I&#x27;ve also had spots, that were left behind from over a decade ago, almost completely disappear. I suffer with acne on occasion and this helps to heal the aftermath of the blemish significantly faster than any product I have used before it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially, I was concerned as it made my face seem a little oilier than normal but after roughly two weeks, my skin began to actually balance itself out. The excess oil on my skin is no where near as bad as it once was. I&#x27;ve only used this on my face, so as a result, this has lasted me over half a year as I just purchased another today. Ultimately, I have to say that out of 15 years of trying to find a healthy moisturizing product, this is the best I&#x27;ve come across and I do not intend to stop using it anytime soon.</li>
    <li> “Ordered one as a gift for my mom, and a second one for me because I have been so happy with the product.”</li>
    <li> This cream is so good, i used it on my face.Amazing result within a few days.Love it&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to buy.</li>
    <li> “This face cream is an excellent moisturizer!!, that&#x27;s why i feel my face smoother and hydrated.”</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t to happy for my face</li>
    <li> I stopped this 2 days after used, my face developed rashes. Its feel so tight on my skin and it itches! I hope i can send this back!</li>
    <li> not as good as expected</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a very long time-it leaves the skin feeling smooth without a greasy look. Infact I like it so much that I have given it to friends as gifts and they too love it.</li>
    <li> This cream is the one i&#x27;ve been looking for! It goes on smooth and it disappears into your skin while doing its job of moisturizing. the only two problems for me are that i have to put a lot on my face at a time because it gets absorbed into your face fairly quickly and that it has a scent (but its not something unpleasant, so im ok with it). Will definitely purchase again.  A year later, I purchased it again when it said that it includes the BONUS TRAVEL SIZE. BUT...I DIDNT GET THE TRAVEL SIZE. The packaging was also the same. Where is the new packaging and the free travel size??? They lied about that. Dont get fooled.</li>
    <li> This was my first purchase of the facial moisturizer and I think it works very well.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend ordered this and I loved it so much I just went ahead and ordered one for my own! It doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy or oily feeling after. I put it on my hand and toe nails and within a few hours could feel and see a difference! It&#x27;s a great cream that will really hydrate you and not leave any residue after.</li>
    <li> UPDATE 2:&lt;br /&gt;Because of the detailed explanations given by the manufacturer in the comment section of this review, I decided to raise the rating to 4 stars for now.  I will adjust it later according to how it performs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days, despite it having some ingredients that I&#x27;m not comfortable with.&lt;br /&gt;Here are some observations:&lt;br /&gt;1. Cream is very thick.&lt;br /&gt;2. It leaves matte finish after you apply it.&lt;br /&gt;3. As far as moisturizing goes, it seems to work ok.  I will leave further update to the review later on.&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;Original review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m not writing about the effectiveness(?) of the product, but the ingredients listed within.&lt;br /&gt;I just received two of these, which I ordered because it specifically said it contains no chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;And I&#x27;m concerned about a few of the ingredients listed on the label.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon description says it has no chemicals, but in fact, it has a few. CYCLOTETRASILOXANE(D4), CYCLOPENTASILOXANE(D5), PHENOXYETHANOL, etc.&lt;br /&gt;You can read about the concerns of D4 and D5 at below link.  Basically, it says D4 in particular can be a hormonal disruptor.&lt;br /&gt;EWG rates D4 as 5(moderate hazard).&lt;br /&gt;http://www.annmariegianni.com/ingredient-watch-list-cyclotetrasiloxane-the-hair-conditioner-that-may-harm-our-waterways/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I&#x27;m not a chemist, so I&#x27;m not an expert on these things.  Can I trust this product to be used on my face everyday?  I&#x27;m not so sure.</li>
    <li> perfect choice work ok hight recommended thank you amazon</li>
    <li> I got this moisturizer as a gift from a friend. At first I was a little skeptical on applying it to my face because I have weird skin, it can be dry and oily at the same time. Anyway, I used cutis vita moisturizer and I really liked it. It left my skin feeling soft and hydrated. Also it wasn&#x27;t greasy afterwards. Another plus is that a little goes a long way. I will purchasing my next one very soon.</li>
    <li> Love this mosturizer, It soak right in to my skin and it leaves no greasy sensation. After I put it on it just feels so fresh and cool! Also I love the very light smell it has, not too strong for me that I don&#x27;t use fragrances. Love it! Love it!!! 5 stars!! Totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> Wife used it. It did not moisturize her face as it said it would. Has a waxy fill. Vaseline does a better job.</li>
    <li> My husband bought this cream for me, and honestly, I love it. I don&#x27;t have bad skin per se, but I do have dry skin that is easily irritated. In the past, I&#x27;ve had bad experiences with skin creams that I&#x27;d spend like $50 on with no results, so I was fairly skeptical when he gave this cream to me. Instantly, I was impressed by all of the natural ingredients. As of now, I haven&#x27;t been using it long, but it has way surpassed my expectations. I love it, and would never consider switching again!</li>
    <li> I ordered this cream because I enjoy the benefits of aloe vera on my skin and like the smell. The formula is non-greasy, goes on smooth and absorbs quickly. The lotion wasn’t too thick or too thin. I also have very sensitive skin and tend to break out from lotions that contain too many perfumes like Bath and Body works. The smell is pleasant but not overwhelming. Overall, a very nice lotion that I plan to get a lot of use out of for my dry skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount for my honest review.</li>
    <li> This lotion is AMAZING!!!! I have been using it for about 10 years now and it has been a remedy for many of my skin imperfections. It has helped me with my acne, bug bites, scars, and even sun burn. It feels very nice and has a very soothing smell. If you have sensitive skin then this is the best lotion to reach for. My boyfriend had a really bad sunburn the other day and I put it on his face and the sunburn was practically gone by the next morning. I am always using this lotion and i recommend it to anyone who has any skin irregularities that they want handled. Thank you for this very awesome product!</li>
    <li> A great friend introduced Me to this product and I have to sat it has worked awesome for my skin. First off my skin is very sensitive to most lotions an oils when using Cutis Vita my skin felt very refreshed and a very cooling sensation. I have applied it over my very dry spots an with in days I can not only see the redness fade but feel less of the dryness in my skin. I recommend this product to anyone who has tried all sorts of products for sensitive skin</li>
    <li> I bought this moisturizer after reading the other reviews on it.  It&#x27;s advertised as a &amp;#34;facial moisturizer&amp;#34; but I have been using it on the rest of my body too and have been very pleased with it.  I live in Arizona and my skin gets very dry here and this cream seems to soften my skin very quickly and is not greasy at all.  When I do use it on my face, I rub it between my fingers and kind of let it &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; a little before patting it on my face.  Seems to work very well.  I will definitely be buying this again and also maybe for gifts.  I just wish they had more products in their line.  All in all a very good product!</li>
    <li> I have really sensitive skin, this is the only cream I can use on my face, love it, will buy again.</li>
    <li> I just recently started using Eczema Cream on my face, prior to using the cream I always had a problem with dryness around my nose area and blotchy areas around my face.  Since using the cream the dryness and the rough patches on my face have gone away.  I’m very happy with the product and believe that it has made a big difference in the feel of my face.  I’m a big believer in Aloe Vera and with that being one of the main ingredients in the cream it leaves a great feeling on my face.  I use it every morning as a moisturizer underneath my foundation, it is quickly absorbed into my skin and never leaves a greasy feeling.  I often find moisturizers that take a bit of time to absorb into my skin often leaving them greasy and making it difficult to apply my foundation.  When I’m pressed for time in the morning I want a product that is going to go on smoothly, leave my face feeling moisturized, and not leave any type of residue the Eczema Cream does exactly that for me.  If your looking for a product to try, I highly recommend this one, you will not be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given the opportunity to purchase the Eczema Cream at a discount for my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Non-greasy, great smell (citrusy), and a little goes a long way.  I actually got my first jar as a gift a while back, excited that I can now purchase it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love this skin cream! My skin is already getting really dry in the cold winter air, and this product helps tremendously. My face is prone to breakouts, but haven&#x27;t had any problems since I began using this. It moisturizers well, isn&#x27;t greasy and absorbs quickly. So happy I found this!</li>
    <li> Very nice cream. It rubs in nicely and moisturizes nicely. It came swiftly. I also used it on a rough patch of skin on my daughter and it already feels smoother.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! It&#x27;s all I use on my arms and legs all year round.  Absorbs quickly,super moisturizing, and I love the scent -clean, fresh, and not overpowering.  Can&#x27;t recommend it enough!</li>
    <li> Soaks right into your skin, non-greasy, very soft, good ingredients, can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> I use this on my lips. It doesn&#x27;t have any fragrances that I can tell and it&#x27;s not smelly which I like. It rubs in very fast and feels like nothing is there. It&#x27;s real light. Try it!</li>
    <li> I break out from pretty much every moisturizer I have ever tried, except this one.  It doesn&#x27;t burn or sting when applied.  It doesn&#x27;t smell terrible.  It makes my skin feel pretty soft and it is not greasy.  I am pretty impressed!</li>
    <li> I have been using this moisturizer on my face for about 10 days now.  It is great.  It feel very refreshing, and is not greasy by any means.  It absorbs in my skin and feels hydrated.  It also helps with acne too!  This is a wonderful product that I will be recommending to many people!</li>
    <li> WOW! This is a great cream! Wonderful fragrance! I will definitely purchase this again!</li>
    <li> Love this product !  I love organic products and this one is bar none!</li>
    <li> This cream was given to me by a friend. I loved it so much that I had to get a few more.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! With the weather being so cold my skin was super dry, I tried numerous lotions, but none worked.  My friend recommended Cutis Vita to me and I thought, it wont hurt to try it.  After the first application my skin felt so soft and there was no oily residue left on my skin! It is now the only thing that I use. :)  I love it!</li>
    <li> Love the way this feels on my skin.  Try to put it on before sun screen too!  Ordering again but it lasted nearly six months!</li>
    <li> I got this for my face, but it&#x27;s a little heavier than I like. It&#x27;s great for elbows and feet. Good value -the jar is filled to the top. Has a very light scent.</li>
    <li> I am Michael&#x27;s wife. We ordered this amazing cream a few days ago and we love it. By we I mean my daughter and I. We have dry skin and it is hard to find good lotions. Normally they are too heavy, or too light, leave a greasy feeling and so on. This cream is our answer. It helps relieve our dry skin, it isn&#x27;t too scented, and is light after a few minutes. Plus I love knowing that it has great ingredients. Thanks You!</li>
    <li> Skin feels smooth and soft. I love that this lotion is not greasy, rubs in easily, and has a pleasant scent that is subtle enough that my husband likes using it too.</li>
    <li> A wonderfully creamy product. Made my holiday roughened hands feel like velvet!</li>
    <li> When I received the cream I immediately opened it and put some on my hands to try it out. I couldn&#x27;t believe how it just sunk right into my skin and left my hands silky and smooth immediately. That was all it took for me to know it was a high quality cream. Since then, I used it all over my body and love how great my skin has become. I don&#x27;t have any more rough and dry patches, but it has been replaced by smooth and silky skin all over. I really love this cream! I received free product in exchange for my unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and thought I would have to spend obscene amounts of money on my skincare products forever. Then a friend told me about Cutis Vita. I was very skeptical but she gave me a little bit to try and I will never go back!    I never expected to find a face and body cream that I could actually use on my face. I don&#x27;t know how they made such an exquisite natural product so affordable but they have a lifetime customer in me. (Just to give you an idea of my quality standards, I switched to Cutis Vita from Eminence. After I started using Cutis Vita, my friends actually noticed how good my skin looked.)    The texture and thickness are perfect. It is rich but not greasy. And I love the fact that it is unscented. That way I can scent it myself if I want.    I always keep three jars on hand. The one for my face I leave as it is. Then I add yummy smelling essential oils to the ones that I use for body lotion and hair cream Yes, I use it on my hair too! (I have very dry hair.)    If I know I will be sweating a lot, I use it on damp skin (for both face and body) otherwise I find it to be little too rich.    This product is make-up remover/cleanser, day cream, night cream and body lotion all in one.    Do yourself a favor and treat yourself to this lovely cream. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very picky about my skin care products and have tried so many moisturizers over the years. This product is one of the best by far! And it&#x27;s so reasonably priced! It&#x27;s non greasy, not sticky, absorbs quickly, has a fresh, natural scent, and leaves my skin feeling so soft and young looking. Being aloe vera based, I know it&#x27;s not only good for moisturizing, but it also helps to heal my skin. I use my hands a lot for work and have to wash them a dozen or more times a day, some moisturizers feel like they wash off, but not this one. It truly absorbs and does an amazing job all day long protecting my skin. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> My wife got a sample of this and loved it.  She has sensitive skin and has difficulty finding creams that she can use.  It provides great moisturizing.  It has a very light pleasant scent, not like many other creams that have an overpowering scent.  Would highly recommend this cream for everyone with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion. It&#x27;s very moisturizing without being greasy or sticky. I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend bought this for me for Xmas as I work outside a lot and my skin gets chapped and raw especially if it&#x27;s windy or cold.  Its been great.  I&#x27;m not a fan of heavy creams that leave a residue and Cutis Vita doesn&#x27;t.  Its got a nice aroma but not one that is cloying.  I have really liked it and would definitively accept another gift!  I&#x27;ll buy it again if he doesn&#x27;t.  Enjoy it!!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product! I would and have recommended Cutis Vita to everyone I know. I have used it for about a year and have seen amazing results. I have dry skin in some areas and combination/normal in others. I have found that this product works phenomenally for every type of skin. For the price, value and ease of ordering, I am truly impressed.</li>
    <li> I have been using this moisturizer for two months and love it.  My skin seems to be softer, my pores smaller and the lines around my eyes less noticeable.  It is not greasy in the least and a little goes a long way.  After two months, I still have over half the 4 oz jar left.  I would definitely buy this product again and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for my face and hands and its a great mosturizer.  Non-oily, fresh and clean smell.</li>
    <li> Great product. Absorbs very well. Love that the first ingredient is aloe and not water.</li>
    <li> This is a great face moisturizer and really does help with keeping my face soft and smooth. This has many more uses than just for a face moisturizer as well! It is great for cracked feet chapped and cracked hands and more. I really like using this on my feet and hands because the aloe in this product soothes the cracks and helps it heal painlessly. This is easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t leave my hands or where I apply it to feeling greasy weighed down or oily which is awesome. It is great for sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t cause rashes or breakouts. It actually helped relieve and clear up a breakout from a lotion that I had a reaction to. I received this product to share my honest thoughts and opinions about it.</li>
    <li> All I can say is yowzah! This cream is rich, thick and creamy but NOT greasy! When you first put it on, you think it&#x27;s greasy but about 30 seconds later your skin has completely absorbed it and feels ridiculously soft. It&#x27;s a GEEnormous jar so it&#x27;ll last forevah, dahlink. It&#x27;s all natural so there&#x27;s no grody chemicals to freak out your skin, no matter how sensitive (and I know from sensitive skin!) I put this on my poor dry knees and elbows and they were immediately transformed. Even The Mister grabbed the jar from me the first time I used it and slathered it on because he was so blown away by how soft I was. Two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> This is amazing I start using this June 5 2015 and I see a good result im so empress  I love it. I recommend this to everyone</li>
    <li> really an excellent product!! hydrates without greasiness or shine, I have seen an improvement in fine lines and dehydration in just a week. I use this with the Watts peptide serum, and it&#x27;s an amazing combination. I had ben using Darphin products before, and the combination of the serum and Cutis Vita moisturizer is just as effective at a fraction of the price!</li>
    <li> I am almost 58 year old and by far, this is the best face cream I have ever used. I can really tell the difference in my skin.  Also, I am very sensitive to fragrances and this product does not give me headaches or migraines.  I will be a repeat customer and just bought one for my mother and one for my sister to try.  Thank you for producing this wonderful product.  Thank you also for producing a cruelty free product.</li>
    <li> I have had the Cutis Vita moisturizer cream for almost a month, and I love it!  I bought it because of the reviews I had read on Amazon. It smells wonderful and I love how it makes my skin feel. I use it morning and evening and my face looks so much better.  I&#x27;m going to have my daughter-in-law try it as well. The best part is the wonderful customer service! What a pleasant surprise to have someone care so much about you and how you think their product is benefiting the customer. I plan to be a lifelong customer. This is an exceptional product.</li>
    <li> Loved it. Works great. I have sensitive skin so I have to be careful about what products I use. I will likely get more when this runs out.</li>
    <li> I have been using this moisturizer for a week now, and my skin has never been better. I live in a very humid environment; and to be honest I hate applying most lotions and creams because of how greasy and slippery they can be. This cream does NOT feel either greasy or slippery. I love how my skin feels after applying it. It absorbs right away and my skin is baby soft. My husband had a little dry rash on his foot so I decided to try this cream on it. It cleared up after three day. Amazing!! Cutis Vita will always have a spot on my vanity!</li>
    <li> I really love this moisturizer! I&#x27;d have to say the main reasons I give this a 5 star revw are:&lt;br /&gt;1) not greasy!! With others, ive had to wait a few minutes before putting on my makeup. This actually absorbs fast and is so light!&lt;br /&gt;2) Doesn&#x27;t have a strange smell. Very light pleasant scent. Some natural products I&#x27;ve smelled have scents like bee pollen or other wierd things I don&#x27;t like. If it&#x27;s close to my nose it better smell good! Lol&lt;br /&gt;3) I like that it&#x27;s all natural! I&#x27;ve tried to find a natural product that didn&#x27;t cost a fortune. I&#x27;ve read so much about what our bodies absorb from products we use..crazy. So this was a great find!&lt;br /&gt;All in all...I will order this again!</li>
    <li> A very high quality product!  I am extremely picky about the things I put on my face and spend alot of money buying different products from Kiehls,Clinique, Aveda, Philosophy, Estee Lauder, Lancome and more.  Basically all there is, I have tried them.  This moisturizer is the best I have ever used.  It is not heavy or greasy.  It leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth and I feel that it is making me feel younger. I would very highly recommend this product to anyone who is picky about what they put on their skin!</li>
    <li> Rich and creamy, not greasy and smells good!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband who was suffering from very dry skin on face and back.  He has only used it a week but has seen drastic improvement overall. Thanks</li>
    <li> I absolutely love how the first ingredient in this cream is Aloe Vera! Usually in products, the first and main ingredient is water. But I was very surprised to find out the first one is Aloe Vera. The first time I used this product was in the morning after I cleansed my face and applied it. I massaged it in. It really sealed in the &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; effect after my cleanser. It felt clean and cooled on my skin. It was also refreshing. Throughout the day, my skin was hydrated and remained hydrated. I have a few pimples that are sometimes red, and this cream helped soothe them and made them less noticeable. It made them less noticeable because it blended them into my skin. That does make sense since Aloe Vera is known to soothe the skin and it definitely soothed mine! Overall, this makes a great hydration moisturizer for all skin types and is very affordable!</li>
    <li> Received as a gift and I loved it! Amazing product! Made my skin feel so much softer and hydrated</li>
    <li> Love this product and won&#x27;t use anything else. Just glad I found it and appreciated Amazon stores with good follow up service. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Light and absorbs well, not greasy at all. And I love the way it smells!</li>
    <li> Very thick and moisturizing, but not heavy or oily.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m bought this for a hand and body cream. It was great. I really love Aloe! The cream is very thick. This is wonderful if used for the right purpose. It&#x27;s to thick for my face but wonderful for my legs and feet, pretty much my whole body. I love how soft it leaves my legs after shaving. No razor bumps etc. Very nice cream</li>
    <li> Lately, I have been having skin reactions to soaps and lotions. This one doesn&#x27;t cause any reaction at all! This is the best moisturizer I have found in years. Thanks Cutis VIta!</li>
    <li> I love this product on my skin. It leaves my skin looking and feeling flawless all day long. No cream has ever done this to my skin. I recommend it as a number 1 cream for the face for any skin type. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Wonderful.  Leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated.  Love that I&#x27;m not not putting a bunch of chemicals onto my skin.  Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> This product is a must have. First time i used it i was very happy to not having greasy hands, face and body. I definitely recommend this product to my friends and family...</li>
    <li> Get medium/heavy cream product.  Just what I was looking for.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Absorbs so quickly without leaving any greasy residue.  My husband had an itchy rash on his back (source unknown) and I rubbed this on it.  He felt instant relief and it was 90% gone the next morning.  I use it on my arms, hands, legs and feet which are all dry due to the long winter we&#x27;ve had in the northeast.</li>
    <li> I have used some very expensive facial creams or over the past 50 years, and I have to say, Cutis Vita is one of the best. I developed a Thyroid problems 3 years ago, and my skin is dry. I have been searching for a long time to find something that really hydrates and moisturizes my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Cutis Vita is wonderful. I will always have some on hand. A little goes a long way. I always moisten my skin before applying to get even coverage.&lt;br /&gt;Do not be afraid to try this product. You will not regret it.</li>
    <li> Great, natural moisturizer. Works well!!</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for a friend, she loves it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something for a while to deal with rough skin around my heels.  A friend recommended it and although it&#x27;s more than I usually spend on a skin cream I wasn&#x27;t having any luck with the drug store choices.  Opened the jar and was surprised at the light fragrance.  Smells clean and fresh.  I&#x27;ve been putting it on my heels and found a difference in my skin in 2-3 days.  No more rough edges, no more snags on the sheet.  Little bit goes a long way.  It&#x27;s a keeper and although more than I normally budget worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I was so pleased to get back from my holiday travels and find this on my doorstep. My hands were cracked and dry from the winter weather and this cream was so soothing. The smell was also wonderful too. I like fresh scents that aren&#x27;t overly perfumey. This was perfect!</li>
    <li> I cannot recommend this product enough.  Don&#x27;t be skeptical about the size-- 4 oz. goes a long way because the cream is very concentrated and a little goes a long way.  The scent is very light and clean smelling.  My favorite part is that the cream is super moisturizing but absorbs quickly.  I&#x27;ve tried many other body butters and thick moisturizers before, but they always leave a greasy residue or are heavily scented.  Now I have people feel my hands all the time, they say my skin feels like a baby&#x27;s butt!! Also, as you ladies know, hands are what age you the fastest, so keeping them well moisturized is a must.</li>
    <li> This cream is excellent! It is very soothing and hydrating. I&#x27;ve used it as a general moisturizer when my skin is feeling dry and I&#x27;ve also used it to help heal burns, scars and even on stretch marks post-baby. I highly recommend it. It lasts a long time too!  Great product!</li>
    <li> Alright a little thick but nourishing!</li>
