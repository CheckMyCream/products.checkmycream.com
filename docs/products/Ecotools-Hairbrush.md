### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The bristles are probably best for thicker shorter hair.</li>
      <li>It works well and the quality is excellent.</li>
      <li>The best part is I am bald.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>But my wife has used this brush a number of times and commented that this a very good brush.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for getting out of the shower or the pool when you need a brush that isn&#x27;t going to hurt your scalp.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also just a great functional brush.</li>
      <li>I guess the biggest difference is the ring design which is supposed to facilitate being a great brush for brushing hair with an air dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>For  reducing drying time, this is a great brush.</li>
      <li>In addition, the brush itself was very kind to my hair.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The bristles are sturdy and they feel good on the scalp.  </li>
      <li>Good brush for drying if that is all you are looking to use it for in our opinion.</li>
      <li>I now have gorgeous Farah Fawcett hair.  </li>
      <li>This is a very interesting hair brush.</li>
      <li>Plus it did get the tangles out pretty well however beyond that its not the best.  </li>
      <li>WE LOVE THIS BRUSH!  </li>
      <li>Great brush easy on the hair...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice quality.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s works well and the bristles feel nice in your hair.</li>
      <li>Nice wooded handle.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, this is a nice brush.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a nice brush and does what it should.</li>
      <li>Great idea for a brush that provides quick hair drying.  </li>
      <li>For those searching for a comfortable hair brush that feels good both to the scalp and hair, this is the one for you.</li>
      <li>It is just a mild pleasant feeling as you brush your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The handle itself is concave and tapers at the end, which I find a very comfortable grip during use.</li>
      <li>I thought this brush sounded like an interesting idea, and perhaps something that could solve a problem.</li>
      <li>well, I am able to add tons of volume to my hair using this brush, even without heat.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice, has a comfortable handle, and</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I think there are better choices out there that will give you some styling capabilities as well.  </li>
      <li>It just means I need a curling iron after drying, but that&#x27;s OK.  </li>
      <li>At this price point, I don&#x27;t see how you can find a better brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The design also lends itself to working well with hair that tangles, brushing through more easily than one that has more closely set bristles.</li>
      <li>But a nice product and definitely worth a try.</li>
      <li>Hers is wavy and easily tangled.  </li>
      <li>I found I can easily brush my hair without it snagging.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve got fine hair and lots of it</li>
      <li>It is too fine and slipped through the brush without holding and received zero air.  </li>
      <li>The wood handle is easy to hold, and the brush goes smoothly through your hair.</li>
      <li>It does seem to assist in drying hair faster, and it&#x27;s comfortable to hold.  </li>
      <li>like the ease of use and the light weight.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;EcoTools products can be depended on for thoughtfully designed, well made products, and this brush is no exception.</li>
      <li>It provides an excellent flow of air through the hollow center making for more efficient, effective styling.</li>
      <li>I think this would be a great tool for long hair, or for curly hair.  </li>
      <li>Maybe it works better on certain types of hair.  </li>
      <li>It seemed to make it more staticky than my normal brush does.  </li>
      <li>like it very much!</li>
      <li>lightweight brush is easy to hold, and much nicer on my toes if I happen to drop it</li>
      <li>So, I really liked the idea of having a brush that would give me a similar effect but without the blow</li>
      <li>It looks and feels well made with a copper-appearing ring dividing the nicely designed wooden handle from the bristle head.</li>
      <li>Feels nice - soft on your scalp, does dry more quickly.  </li>
      <li>just right with one hand and the dryer with another hand.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My first impression on receiving this air dryer brush is why would they design a brush with such a huge hole in the center lol?</li>
      <li>The shape assists the user to dry hair quickly, nicely and effectively.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>There are other models from the Ecotools line that I am eager to try out, like the smooth brush one which appears to have a better design.</li>
      <li>I have fine, curly hair, so it knots and breaks easily, so I have to be careful when using brushes.  </li>
      <li>get one and see how much easier it is to do your hair...and faster!</li>
      <li>you have longer hair and blow-dry frequently, you may really enjoy using this brush.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The lightness of the brush makes styling easier than the heavier, more cumbersome bristle brushes currently on the market.</li>
      <li>However, this one works for getting most of the moisture out prior to using that brush.</li>
      <li>At first glance, the hole came to mind.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t notice too much tangling when using this, so it does help to comb out well, and anything that helps cut down on heat time is a good thing.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t work so much as a styling brush for my straight chin length &#x27;do, but I do appreciate the quick drying time.  </li>
      <li>This hairbrush has a large hole in it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, this Ecotools ultimate air dryer brush is a good brush that does seems to dry my hair faster.</li>
      <li>The bamboo handle is comfortable for medium to smaller</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s the whole purpose of the the hole.</li>
      <li>The wooden handled-ergonomic design is light but sturdy.</li>
      <li>It does help speed up drying, but not by so much.  </li>
      <li>Very big.&lt;br</li>
      <li>kidding, I don&#x27;t really have a pet egg ...</li>
      <li>the hole take up too much space?</li>
      <li>That picture doesn&#x27;t really do justice to the hole.</li>
      <li>This is my new favorite brush - a high quality hairbrush makes such a difference!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nicer than other brushes she has, and she&#x27;s glad she owns this one.  </li>
      <li>The Eco Ultimate Air Dryer Brush is quite a unique hair styling tool.</li>
      <li>- it&#x27;s a light brush with a hole in the center that allows the hot air to circulate, and the bristles aren&#x27;t packed too closely together.</li>
      <li>but I noticed it helped a bit, but then I have lots of long, fine hair) and that&#x27;s because of its design</li>
      <li>can you keep brushing my hair?&amp;#34; I almost did a back flip right then and there!</li>
      <li>My hair is fine and very long.</li>
      <li>I am not 100% sure, and with the teeth of the brush not so densely packed together, it does not tangle up your hair as you brush down with the hairdryer.  </li>
      <li>It does, I suppose, smooth your hair as you dry it.  </li>
      <li>It left my hair soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>The tipped, flexible plastic bristles on a plastic O ring brush base allows my blow drier more hair surface area to dry more quickly with more body.</li>
      <li>The bristles have those little balls on the top so they won&#x27;t damage hair, but I worry that they may eventually separate from the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The build quality is good, not great.  </li>
      <li>The basic idea is when used with a hairdryer, the hole in the brush will enable the blown air to better dry your hair while brushing your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The hole in the middle of the brush lets the hot air from the dryer go through speeding up the hair drying process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is light, glides through my hair (I have medium length, relatively fine hair with a little bit of wave) and really smooths my hair in a way that my other regular brush does not.  </li>
      <li>Not a blow dryer brush, which I perceive as less eco friendly.  </li>
      <li>The center is open and the brush is extremely light in weight.  </li>
      <li>But the bristles are surprisingly soft, and don&#x27;t hold my think</li>
      <li>If you have sensitive hair, you may want to give this one a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
      <li>I was in complete shock.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t think it gave me more volume, so the only downside would be that I still need to use the round brush to style my hair.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s not that easy for me to maneuver with my small hands/head.</li>
      <li>The Ultimate Air Dryer Brush is pretty good, but it doesn&#x27;t replace a round brush, at least for my needs.  </li>
      <li>However, the way it works, is as you run it through your hair and blow dry from the top or bottom, it dries the hair in the center of the hole because it is not blocked by the actual brush (I hope you can picture that in your head!)</li>
      <li>I rated EcoTools Ultimate air dryer brush 4 stars because it is a decent brush.</li>
      <li>particularly like the extra bonus of the massaging effect (not much to do with my hair style, but very relaxing.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My wife has very thick hair that takes a long time to dry.  This brush affords her the ability to straighten and dry her hair simultaneously.  The hole in the middle of the brush lets the hot air from the dryer go through speeding up the hair drying process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is lightweight and easier to use than her other brushes and the materials from which it is made should last longer than traditional all plastic hairbrushes.  My stepdaughter has long hair and has found that this brush shortens her drying time by about half.</li>
    <li> The crazy doughnut shaped hole is a little strange at first, but totally makes sense!&lt;br /&gt;Am totally loving this eco-tools ultimate air dryer brush. Wondered if the claim to dry hair up to 40% faster was just a bunch of hooey, but SHAZAM it&#x27;s true.&lt;br /&gt;The lightweight brush is easy to hold, and much nicer on my toes if I happen to drop it [it happens!].&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m kidding, I don&#x27;t really have a pet egg ...yet.</li>
    <li> I have short but very coarse, thick hair that takes a long time to dry. I thought this brush sounded like an interesting idea, and perhaps something that could solve a problem. Unfortunately that is not the case. The brush allows your hair to dry faster I think because you&#x27;re just blowing the air straight on to your hair through the center hole. The brush itself isn&#x27;t useful at all for styling your hair, at least not short hair. It does, I suppose, smooth your hair as you dry it.  Really not useful at all.</li>
    <li> Great brush easy on the hair...</li>
    <li> I rated EcoTools Ultimate air dryer brush 4 stars because it is a decent brush. My first impression on receiving this air dryer brush is why would they design a brush with such a huge hole in the center lol? The size is on the larger/medium so it&#x27;s not that easy for me to maneuver with my small hands/head. It took some time to hold the brush just right with one hand and the dryer with another hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this Ecotools ultimate air dryer brush is a good brush that does seems to dry my hair faster. There are other models from the Ecotools line that I am eager to try out, like the smooth brush one which appears to have a better design.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical about this hair brush being able to dry your hair. It does! I was in complete shock.</li>
    <li> This is a very interesting hair brush. As the picture shows, the handle is connected to an oval brush. Around the permiter of the oval is the actual brush. the center is cut away. The basic idea is when used with a hairdryer, the hole in the brush will enable the blown air to better dry your hair while brushing your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just for giggles, I tried this with my short hair. This should come as no surprise, but I didn&#x27;t benefit from it. On the other hand, my wife who has shoulder length  hair said it did speed up the process of drying her hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We both agreed that there is a bit of a learning curve and art to using this brush. You are going to get slightly different results using it. Typically when my wife has used a regular brush to dry her hair, she runs the brush through her hair, and while the hair is still in the brush, turns it toward the dryer to use the air to dry it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this brush is a bit different. Because you are blowing the air inside the brush, not only does it dry a larger amount of hair at once, but your hair dries a little differently. It gives your hair a little more body when dried. It is a little hard to explain without being able to visualize it. This is not a huge revolutionary change, but more of subtle difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have longer hair and blow-dry frequently, you may really enjoy using this brush. And since it is under $15 is won&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
    <li> This really cut down on the drying time for my daughter&#x27;s long hair.  Plus it did get the tangles out pretty well however beyond that its not the best.  I think there are better choices out there that will give you some styling capabilities as well.  Good brush for drying if that is all you are looking to use it for in our opinion.</li>
    <li> The EcoTools Ultimate Air Dryer Brush claims to cut down on the time it takes to blow dry your hair. It&#x27;s true (a little - it&#x27;s not going to drastically cut down the time but I noticed it helped a bit, but then I have lots of long, fine hair) and that&#x27;s because of its design - it&#x27;s a light brush with a hole in the center that allows the hot air to circulate, and the bristles aren&#x27;t packed too closely together. It&#x27;s lighter than my other brush (so helps when you&#x27;re holding up a brush and a blow dryer), but the bristles could be a little softer (they&#x27;re metal with a little plastic on the end) - in other words, don&#x27;t use too much force when combing through your hair. I don&#x27;t notice too much tangling when using this, so it does help to comb out well, and anything that helps cut down on heat time is a good thing.</li>
    <li> i like the idea behind the design, and it works ok. But the bristles are surprisingly soft, and don&#x27;t hold my think hair well. I use it occasionally, but it&#x27;s not a total problem solver.</li>
    <li> The bristles are probably best for thicker shorter hair. My hair is fine and very long. It tangles in the brush.</li>
    <li> At first glance, the hole came to mind. This hairbrush has a large hole in it. That picture doesn&#x27;t really do justice to the hole. It&#x27;s big. Very big.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, this is a nice brush. It&#x27;s works well and the bristles feel nice in your hair. If you have sensitive hair, you may want to give this one a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does the hole take up too much space? Maybe. Then again maybe not. Hairbrushes can be very expensive. At eleven bucks, this one is not. It&#x27;s great for getting out of the shower or the pool when you need a brush that isn&#x27;t going to hurt your scalp.</li>
    <li> I used this brush this morning on my already dry hair.  It seemed to make it more staticky than my normal brush does.  So, I think I will keep this brush just for when I am drying my hair.  It did not work well on my already dried hair.</li>
    <li> This is such a well-made brush. The wood handle is easy to hold, and the brush goes smoothly through your hair. The special design is meant to cut down on dry time. Not sure if it really does, but I would definitely recommend this brush. It works well and the quality is excellent.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend  - hair drying time significantly reduced - at least by half.  In addition, the brush itself was very kind to my hair.&lt;br /&gt; I have fine, curly hair, so it knots and breaks easily, so I have to be careful when using brushes.  The bristles are thinner and softer than my other regular, rectangular vented brush.  Between that and the hole in the middle I found I can easily brush my hair without it snagging.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I both have hair to our waists.  Hers is wavy and easily tangled.  Mine is curly.  Both of us have extremely thick hair.  WE LOVE THIS BRUSH!  It doesn&#x27;t hurt to brush hair while wet and it cuts our drying time by quite a bit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m getting my teenage niece and my college niece both one for upcoming birthdays!</li>
    <li> It really does cut down on drying time!</li>
    <li> Does seem to help reduce drying time when used with the blow dryer. It left my hair soft and smooth. My only real complaint is that the bristles could be a little better at detangling. I&#x27;m not sure how exactly you would use this as a diffuser, but it says you can in the directions. For  reducing drying time, this is a great brush.</li>
    <li> The EcoTools Ultimate Air Dryer Brush is a nifty addition to my styling cabinet.  The brush has a hole in the center to allow air to pass through which lessens drying time.  This will protect your hair from heat damage because you spend less time with heat on your hair.  The brush can also act as a diffuser - this is a plus.  It&#x27;s also just a great functional brush.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of EcoTools.  The Ultimate Air Dryer Brush is pretty good, but it doesn&#x27;t replace a round brush, at least for my needs.  It does seem to assist in drying hair faster, and it&#x27;s comfortable to hold.  The bristles have those little balls on the top so they won&#x27;t damage hair, but I worry that they may eventually separate from the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the ease of use and the light weight.  I think this would be a great tool for long hair, or for curly hair.  It doesn&#x27;t work so much as a styling brush for my straight chin length &#x27;do, but I do appreciate the quick drying time.  It just means I need a curling iron after drying, but that&#x27;s OK.  Just because it&#x27;s not the &amp;#34;ultimate&amp;#34; hair tool for me doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t be for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EcoTools products can be depended on for thoughtfully designed, well made products, and this brush is no exception.</li>
    <li> Different than any brush I&#x27;ve ever used.  It feels like it massages your scalp.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I have not tried the detangler paddle brush, but this one does the trick for detangling! My mom got this brush for me and I used it for the first time on my hair while dry (and relatively tangle-free). It felt gentle, so I tried it on my 6-year-old daughter who has fine hair and screams bloody murder every time I brush her hair. I started brushing out tangles yesterday on her dry hair and did not hear ONE PEEP out of her! Instead, when I was done, she said, &amp;#34;Mommy can you keep brushing my hair?&amp;#34; I almost did a back flip right then and there! It&#x27;s a keeper - and I&#x27;m going to buy one for her room and to keep in her swim bag too!</li>
    <li> omg...amazing!!!!  get one and see how much easier it is to do your hair...and faster!</li>
    <li> Doesnt dry my hair any faster than any other brush but i do like it</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s what my wife said about this brush (FYI, she has hair a little longer than her shoulders): 1) It&#x27;s nice, has a comfortable handle, and brushes well.  2) It does help speed up drying, but not by so much.  3) It&#x27;s nicer than other brushes she has, and she&#x27;s glad she owns this one.  In summary, recommends it!</li>
    <li> Decreased my drying time significantly!</li>
    <li> When I found out it drys hair 40% faster, I thought it was a brush where it would dry my hair so that I wouldn&#x27;t actually do it with a blow dryer. I was wrong. That&#x27;s the whole purpose of the the hole. It&#x27;s to put your blow dryer and brush while you dry. I don&#x27;t use heating appliances. On the hair growth how to&#x27;s, they say to not use heating appliances. I use this to massage my scalp to grow out my hair. I&#x27;d probably try it out in the shower. It&#x27;s like the back scratcher to my head. I probably won&#x27;t use any other brush.</li>
    <li> For those searching for a comfortable hair brush that feels good both to the scalp and hair, this is the one for you. The wooden handled-ergonomic design is light but sturdy. Unlike wire brushes, the acrylic bristles will not damage hair while blow drying. It provides an excellent flow of air through the hollow center making for more efficient, effective styling. I base this off my wife&#x27;s use of it since I don&#x27;t blow-dry my short hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lightness of the brush makes styling easier than the heavier, more cumbersome bristle brushes currently on the market. It looks and feels well made with a copper-appearing ring dividing the nicely designed wooden handle from the bristle head. The handle itself is concave and tapers at the end, which I find a very comfortable grip during use. The design also lends itself to working well with hair that tangles, brushing through more easily than one that has more closely set bristles. At this price point, I don&#x27;t see how you can find a better brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Kort</li>
    <li> Feels nice - soft on your scalp, does dry more quickly.  Nice wooded handle.</li>
    <li> I re ever this item to try out.  I guess the biggest difference is the ring design which is supposed to facilitate being a great brush for brushing hair with an air dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it work?  Yes.  I now have gorgeous Farah Fawcett hair.  The best part is I am bald.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, no.  But my wife has used this brush a number of times and commented that this a very good brush.  The build quality is good, not great.  Given the price point that shouldn&#x27;t be a surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a nice brush and does what it should.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical that this brush could actually blow dry my hair more quickly. However, the way it works, is as you run it through your hair and blow dry from the top or bottom, it dries the hair in the center of the hole because it is not blocked by the actual brush (I hope you can picture that in your head!). I didn&#x27;t think it gave me more volume, so the only downside would be that I still need to use the round brush to style my hair. However, this one works for getting most of the moisture out prior to using that brush.</li>
    <li> Not a styling brush.  Does the donut hole help to speed up the drying?  I am not 100% sure, and with the teeth of the brush not so densely packed together, it does not tangle up your hair as you brush down with the hairdryer.  There was not much grip with the hair.</li>
    <li> The tipped, flexible plastic bristles on a plastic O ring brush base allows my blow drier more hair surface area to dry more quickly with more body. The bamboo handle is comfortable for medium to smaller hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The slight curved back of the brush helps keep longer hair less tangled. The EcoTools Ultimate Air Dryer Brush is less forgiving with pulls than our Bass Nylon Bristle hair brushes; this EcoTools is a air dryer brush and does not replace our Bass daily go to brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; My wife likes this brush for drying her hair at the gym after a swim. That&#x27;s a time saver for me too and I appreciate that.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m almost at a loss for describing what I dislike about this product.  Maybe it works better on certain types of hair.  I&#x27;ve got fine hair and lots of it and I like the effect of blow drying, but don&#x27;t like to blow dry my hair.  So, I really liked the idea of having a brush that would give me a similar effect but without the blow dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is where things went poorly.  I couldn&#x27;t even get this thing to help me brush/comb my hair into place.  Not a fan.  In either sense of the word&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**** UPDATE**** It was brought to my attention that I misinterpreted how this Eco Tool was to be used.  The coupling of &amp;#34;ECO&amp;#34; with the title &amp;#34;AIR BRUSH&amp;#34; made it seem like it was an environmental stretch to sell a brush.  For hair.  Not a blow dryer brush, which I perceive as less eco friendly.  However.... I used the brush with my blow dryer (which I admit I avoid using) and I found this brush nearly impossible to work with my type of hair.  It is too fine and slipped through the brush without holding and received zero air.  Took me a tiny bit longer to blow dry my hair than when I used my round blow dyer brush.</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite brush - a high quality hairbrush makes such a difference!  It is light, glides through my hair (I have medium length, relatively fine hair with a little bit of wave) and really smooths my hair in a way that my other regular brush does not.  And it truly does help speed the drying process when I use my hair dryer!  Yes, the hole in the middle is big, but that&#x27;s to help with drying and apparently to use as a diffuser.  All in all, this is a well-made product and I can recommend it!</li>
    <li> Great idea for a brush that provides quick hair drying.  It&#x27;s nice quality.  The bristles are sturdy and they feel good on the scalp.  I found it a bit hard to get used to holding the brush at first.  The center is open and the brush is extremely light in weight.  Very different feeling than other brushes I&#x27;m used to.  But a nice product and definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> The Eco Ultimate Air Dryer Brush is quite a unique hair styling tool. The shape assists the user to dry hair quickly, nicely and effectively.&lt;br /&gt;I particularly like the extra bonus of the massaging effect (not much to do with my hair style, but very relaxing. It feels great)!Note,this effect is not because of a battery or a plug in cord. It is just a mild pleasant feeling as you brush your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As well, I am able to add tons of volume to my hair using this brush, even without heat.&lt;br /&gt;I like it very much!</li>
