<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great price and received product as stated!  Furthermore, packaged product was perfectly protected for transportation (even if dropped it would not have broken)! Thanks!</li>
    <li> The proof is in the pudding. The product arrived in excellent shape and in a timely manner. What more can you ask for? Maybe a complimentary taco....</li>
    <li> Fast delivery &amp; awesome price!  Love my Happy!  My favorite perfume. Very light clean scent &amp; I always get stopped by men &amp; women asking me what I&#x27;m wearing &amp; telling me how good I smell.</li>
    <li> This is one of my wife&#x27;s favorite scent, so I got it for her as a Christmas present.  It is a lot less than in the stores, so it is a super value.  Very HAPPY with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Gift for our pastors wife and I know she will love it!!</li>
    <li> my wife loves happy and this is a good deal</li>
    <li> My eldest Grand Girl bought this for her Mom. Will be totally surprised  , as she says , &amp;#34;it&#x27;s too expensive&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Girl has first &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; after school job, and is so proud to be able to get this for her Mom!</li>
    <li> Good product. fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister. She really likes this perfume for the latest years. She s very happy w/ the product.</li>
    <li> My daughter loved Happy and we gave it to her for Christmas.  Amazon&#x27;s price was the most reasonable that I found after pricing it in the department stores.  Saved me over $10.  Thanks!!!!</li>
    <li> I just love this perfume! I&#x27;ve been wearing it for as long as I can remember! This is a great fragrance for a person sensitive to smells, it&#x27;s not overpowering...it has a nice light citrus smell. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite perfume for years and I was ecstatic when I finally got my hands on a bottle!! It&#x27;s a unique scent that lifts you up and you honestly can&#x27;t help but feel \\&quot;happy\\&quot; when you breathe it in :) My husband is very leery of my perfumes but doesn&#x27;t mind this one. I highly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> excellent product..However, Amazon was extremely slow processing and shipping my order..I am not sure I want to order from Amazon again....!!!</li>
    <li> my mother loved this and for the price you get like double than you would buying it from a store like Macys.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance and I thought the price was excellent.  The eu de parfum is very high quality and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000C1Z3LS Happy By Clinique For Women. Eau De Parfum Spray 3.4 Ounces]]  I have always loved the fresh, long-lasting scent of Happy by Clinique for Women.  Amazon, once again, had the best price for this product and the product was exactly as advertised.  As usual, the delivery was sufficiently fast for the price I paid (free delivery).  I love that Amazon tells you exactly when it will arrive.  I use Amazon quite frequently because they have the products I like for the price I want.     Summary: I&#x27;m very satisfied with this purchase.  Buy this  perfume if you want a reasonably priced perfume that won&#x27;t break the bank and will provide compliments from those around you.</li>
    <li> The best smelling perfume, my favorite! Spring smelling and clean smelling</li>
    <li> Actually the scent we were familiar seemed very week compared to years of usage</li>
    <li> Several years ago I was given a bottle of Happy and I had received many compliments while wearing it.  When I went to the mall to purchase more, they were out of Happy and offered me another perfume.  I was fairly pleased with that perfume and, over the past few years, I have changed perfume every time I purchased a bottle.  I guess I was looking for a sort of signature fragrance, something no one else wore.  Recently I was browsing Amazon and noticed Happy was available on sale and thought maybe I should give it another go, despite my desire to find some obscure scent.  There is a reason Happy is so well known, it has a pleasing and not-too-strong smell.  The smell lingers on my sweaters and jackets, so I do not have to re-apply all the time.  Many people have commented on and complimented me on this fragrance.  So I guess Happy makes me happy.</li>
    <li> Real deal at a awesome price</li>
    <li> MY FAVORITE PERFUME OF ALL TIME!!  I&#x27;D BY IT A THOUSAND MORE TIMES AND THE PRICE IS PERFECT. THIS BOTTLE IS HUGE!</li>
    <li> Light lovely scent. Quick delivery.</li>
    <li> Great value, cheaper than the department stores.</li>
    <li> My wife loves Happy by Clinique. She has been using this as long as I&#x27;ve known her; I like how it smells on her. She recently celebrated her birthday, and she asked for this. The price here on Amazon is good, and delivery was fast.</li>
    <li> My wife everyday fragance, good price, well packed.</li>
    <li> I just received my large bottle of Happy, which DID show up on time and in great shipping condition.  But, when I opened the package up to enjoy the fresh-floral, citrusy bouquet...it was NOT the wonderful fragrance I was used to.  I have been wearing Happy for almost 10 years. But this bottle had to be either very old, or not stored at reasonable temperatures because the aroma that came off of my wrist was NOT pleasing in any way.  It may be a problem with LARGE bottles of Happy.  Perhaps people do not order them as often so they sit on a shelf for too long.  I did call Amazon and they will be crediting my card in 2-3 business days. As always they provided good customer service.  Just sad that I can not wear my Happy.  Also, you can NOT return this item, here is the message you get if you try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com. Customers should dispose of hazardous materials according to Local, State and Federal regulations. Customers should contact their local government or local waste company for directions on how to dispose of Household Hazardous Waste.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the only options are to have them send a replacement, which might have the same problem, or get a refund.</li>
    <li> Very fresh citrus fragrance. I always get great compliments when I wear this.</li>
    <li> What can I say? This is my second bottle so obviously this stuff is fantastic.</li>
    <li> This is the first perfume that I have found that smells good on me.It has such a soft scent.</li>
    <li> happy with service and product , just like the name lol</li>
    <li> I like this scent because it is very light and fresh!  And it was a good price for the size.</li>
    <li> Be careful buying some of these high end perfumes, a lot of fakes out there. Even those sold through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;The one we got was a fake. The scent is very close, but does not last as the legit ones do. I buy a few of these a year&lt;br /&gt;for my wife as it is the only fragrance she wears, so I am always looking for a deal.. Been unlucky so far in finding&lt;br /&gt;the real deal at a discount. I have tried several of the fragrance discounters and only the brick and mortar retail stores&lt;br /&gt;seem to have the true product. And they never seem to discount them..</li>
    <li> The perfume came very fast.THANKS!</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of smelling good, and this perfume hits the mark!  It has a really nice clean, citrus smell, with just a hint of flowers for those how prefer less flowery smells. Not to metion, i scoured the internet and, as usual, Amazon had the best price as far as price and shipping costs.  THANKS AMAZON</li>
    <li> favorite perfume and great shipping</li>
    <li> Excellent price and product! Got mine last night and the box and perfume was perfect! It is authentic! I will definitely order this again!!</li>
    <li> I was first introduced to this scent by a friend and was not so sure about it.&lt;br /&gt;Not many perfumes blend well with cigarette smoke, which is a must in my world. But this one does beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been hooked on it since.</li>
    <li> FAST SHIPPING, LOVE THIS SMELL!!</li>
    <li> It arrived as expected and was a great gift for a friend!</li>
    <li> I was very concerned after I read all of the reviews on this perfume.  I have worn Clinique Happy for years and I was completely out.  There was only one store that sold this perfume in the small town I am from and the store shut down!  Needless to say, I was desperate to get some more when I ran out.  This i definitely genuine Clinique Happy Perfume.  I have the nose of a hound dog and I would know if something was not right.  The only reason I gave this product four stars is because it says on the sales page that there is Prime shipping, but this item did not come in two days.  It took about a week to get it.  Overall good experience and I am happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Very happy, great price,&#x27;fast shipping</li>
    <li> Product was exactly as promised. Brand new, cellophane wrapped. Package even arrived earlier than expected. Completely happy with this purchase and its processing.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted.  Quick delivery and great product.  Thanks!!!!</li>
    <li> very respectfull, I recommend it</li>
    <li> This is the one she wanted. We did purchase a bottle of this fragrance from a street vendor in NYC once. My wife was very disappointed. It must have been a knock off. The scent did not last like the real stuff. Like this one.</li>
    <li> i got this for my wife, and I like it and so does she.  She uses it of course but if you&#x27;re on the fence about perfume guys, go for this.</li>
    <li> LOVE Clinique Happy!!</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s favorite fragrance, best price in the US.</li>
    <li> Wife very, very happy.</li>
    <li> Love the light scent and sometimes get questioned if I am wearing Happy(some people recognize the fragrance)</li>
    <li> Item. Was placed in a box four sizes larger although I appreciate the need for safety it was over done</li>
    <li> What can I say....... it&#x27;s one of my wife&#x27;s favorites! Clinique has got a customer for life as long as they keep up the quality control.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery! Great price.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, product in original sealed package.</li>
    <li> Not very happy with this perfume, doesn&#x27;t last long at all and I&#x27;ve purchased this in department stores before and the smell lingered all day but not this bottle and it smells slightly different for some reason.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this scent for years!!!! It&#x27;s such a captivating scent, I highly recommend it - absolutely worth the price, as always, I have to get the large bottle because go through it quick.</li>
    <li> Greatest smelling fragance on earth!!</li>
    <li> I was excited to see a good price for this perfume but when I opened it doesn&#x27;t have the same distinct smell nor does it last as long.  Disappointed for sure</li>
    <li> Great price, got in timely matter.  Ready to reorder again!</li>
    <li> My wife always wears this fragrance, and this time the perfume does not seem the same. It seems out of the standard (normal) or something. I would like an explanation of the seller!</li>
    <li> I have been using Clinique&#x27;s HAPPY for a number of years and what I love the most about it is that I ALWAYS receive compliments on my perfume when I wear it.  Others seem to like it as much as I do.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn this scent for years as have 2 of my daughters.  All of us are constantly being complimented on it and asked&lt;br /&gt;for name so friends can purchase it.</li>
    <li> &#x27;ve used Happy by Clinique for many years and like the fresh, clean fragrance.  I recommend it and other Clinique cosmetic products for any woman with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Love the product! I&#x27;ve using it for the past 20 years...it&#x27;s cheaper to purchase via amazon instead of department store.</li>
    <li> Great deal ! Prompt service!! :) Thank you!!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my daughter in law.  It smells wonderful on her, and this is the best price I have found on or off line.</li>
    <li> The only perfume I wear.  When people continue to compliment you on what you&#x27;re wearing, then it&#x27;s a no-brainer.</li>
    <li> love this light clean scent</li>
    <li> This is the favorite of my niece and so I was pleased to be able to get it for her so now she walks thru life surrounded by happiness</li>
    <li> one of my favorite fragrances</li>
    <li> I have used this product before for many years, I got this new bottle and it has to be a copy has no smell, no matter how much I put on does not smell. Original last for hours and it smells great! not happy with Happy by Clinique, which I could return, a waste of money!!!!</li>
    <li> One of the BEST out there. Fresh, clean My favorite! Whether a small bottle or large, you will feel wonderful and get a ton of compliments wearing this!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a perfume that was not overwhelming, clean, crisp and fragrant.  Happy meets all my requirements &amp; I continually get comments from strangers wanting to know what I&#x27;m wearing.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Great birthday gift! Wife loved it. Thanks!</li>
    <li> When I was at the store,  the sales rep told me that clinique got the name &amp;#34;happy&amp;#34;  because it makes everyone in the lab happy when they were testing it. And it sure does!&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for my girlfriend&#x27;s mom.  She&#x27;s at her mid 50&#x27;s and I have personally never met her (she lives in Korea).&lt;br /&gt;My first option was D&amp;G Light Blue since it&#x27;s more sophisticated and is very user friendly. It&#x27;s one of those that anyone could wear, but not for any occasions.&lt;br /&gt;That said,  I was a bit skeptical about buying this since I know it&#x27;s more of a teeny to young adult scent. After much pondering,  I decided to give it a go.&lt;br /&gt;What made up my mind is that.. You can&#x27;t really not like this perfume. It&#x27;s just one of those that are either good or perfect. Anyone that&#x27;s been around the scent has no complaints whatsoever. It smells like clean, vibrant and fresh with a hunt if floral. Unlike the Light Blue,  this is easily an everyday perfume; at any occasion; at any season. It&#x27;s unique in its own way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have over 20 colognes myself and I can honestly say...  I might just one for myself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go.  You can&#x27;t get wrong.</li>
    <li> the fragrance is there and not others that lose  their fragrance very good</li>
    <li> This is a perfume that my wife really likes, as do I. I thought the price was reasonable, especially with free shipping and no tax through Amazon.</li>
    <li> Excellent and price is great</li>
    <li> It had been a good long time since I purchased Happy and it just smells so good!  Classic, light scent... so nice!!</li>
    <li> This is a very light scent and I always get many compliments when I wear this scent.  I love the lightness of it, it is my favorite!</li>
    <li> Great Packaging! Use this method all the time for all my deliveries! Don&#x27;t change a thing on this type of packaging.</li>
    <li> It was just way I thought it was happy made me feel like a queen it beat every day price</li>
    <li> My wife was quite pleased!</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Happy\\&quot; has been my signature fragrance for about 8 years now. I love it and my husband loves it on me. He wears \\&quot;Happy\\&quot; for men. I ordered this one after I ran out and they were out of it at my local Clinique counter. It came sealed and brand new, however after applying the first time, I realized it was a very watered down version of what I have always bought from my store. I happened to look at the bottom of the bottle which is usually stamped, Made in the USA.....NY, NY. This bottle was made in Switzerland. May not have had anything to do with the scent not being nearly as strong, but that would be my first guess. I do like the fragrance, but could not give it the full 5 stars for that reason!!</li>
    <li> Happy is my wife&#x27;s favorite and I really like it too.  Definitely a winner for me. Pricing here was good and the convenience of online ordering is great.</li>
    <li> product as described, Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I was ready for a new fragrance and this fit my scent profile well. Goo value s well.</li>
    <li> Just like I bought before at Macy&#x27;s .  Perfect very pleased will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume, I&#x27;ve purchased this before from Amazon and have been very happy, however, this time am very disappointed with the product I received.  It does seem &amp;#34;watered down&amp;#34;.  The scent is very weak and doesn&#x27;t last.  Not sure what happened with this order, if it was the seller or what, but I&#x27;m hesitant to purchase this again from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great perfume, price, and size this was a great gift idea and she loves this perfume with the aroma it gives off</li>
    <li> I purchased this fragrance for my wife. She told me that she loves the scent and said that she has received many positive and complimentary comments when wearing it. The price was very reasonable compared to the local department stores. I definitely will buy this item again as soon as I notice that she needs a replacement. With Valentine Day approaching, I would highly recommend this item to all the men reading this review.</li>
    <li> This was actually a gift for my daughter and she LOVES IT!!!!!!!!    IT&#x27;S ALL SHE HAS WORN FOR YEARS AND IT SMELLS WONDERFUL ON HER.</li>
    <li> This Happy by Clinic is the European version not the American version. Needless to say it does not smell the same. You get what you pay for. It is cheaper but....</li>
    <li> Is is not the real product , although it&#x27;s in Clinque packaging.  I am very disappointed that I was fooled &amp; bought this from Amazon. Buy it t a local department store, it will be easier to return.</li>
    <li> This is not a normal Clinique Happy perfume. What I received is either very old or baked in the sun. The scent is not correct.  I&#x27;ve worn Clinique Happy since it came out so I know the scent.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> I bought the frangancia and feel that it has a prolonged odor, does not stay all day. I already had used before this perfume and smell remained until night, he felt even in clothes after washing. I think this perfume is not genuine. It is the second that I buy on amazon , different brand , and I got it.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing Happy for years, what I received was not Happy by Clinique. I have ordered it from Amazon before and luckily never had an issue until I received the bottle this week.  As always the item arrived right on time and intact. The perfume box looked real, it was wrapped, and it was a full bottle, but when I looked at the color of the perfume it was yellow. I know it is supposed to be clear. The fragrance was not right either, it was a very stale/old scent, it was absolutely awful. I don&#x27;t know if it is just extremely old or if it is a fake. Either way I am not pleased. This size bottle lasts a long time, and I have never had a bottle turn yellow on me before or lose it&#x27;s citrus fragrance.  This is my favorite perfume and I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great product!&lt;br /&gt;It has a light aroma yet, it last for almost all day.&lt;br /&gt;This was a gift and she&#x27;s very please with it.</li>
    <li> Super price compared to every place else.  My wife loves the stuff, I loved the price. This not an expensive perfume.  I searched every where for competitive pricing, and got it.  Plus the shipping was great. This was a happily received Christmas gift.</li>
    <li> I have used this fragrance for many years.  It is my signature fragrance. I have received many complements on it  from friends and  relatives ever since I began using it.</li>
    <li> I am extremely satisfied with this purchase.  I ordered HAPPY as a Christmas gift for my daughter in law.  This is her favorite fragrance.  I would recommend other to order HAPPY.</li>
    <li> 2 x as much for the same price as others I have purchased from</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this perfume. Nothing else compares. I will only buy this from here on out. Just a great product.</li>
    <li> I bought the perfume Clinique Happy for women several times before and I KNOW its fragrance very well. The bottle of Clinique Happy I received from the seller Zoies Smells is NOT authentic. It is fake. It does not smell like authentic Clinique Happy! And The bottle looks different!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I liked this scent when I was given a sample from Macy&#x27;s a few years ago. Never purchased it because I just wouldn&#x27;t spend the money for myself. When I was ordering the other items I purchased, this caught my eye and the price was right. So, I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
    <li> I used to wear this perfume years ago and forget about until I came across it on Amazon and boy am I glad I did. It brought back delicious memories and smells awesome. So awesome in fact on Friday I went to McDonald&#x27;s after a long day at work ( don&#x27;t judge me I went to get smoothie lol) and the manager who was helping me with my order said &amp;#34;I know that smell it happy by Clinique&amp;#34; not only was I impressed that she got it down pack but equally impressed that she could still smell it on me after 10 hours. She told me she loves it also and she keeps it on hand. The following day I wore it again and walked pass my mom after about 5 hours of wearing it and she said &amp;#34; oooh you smell nice&amp;#34; ( my mom is hard to impress) and I told her what I was wearing and promised I would get her a bottle. This stuff is great and will now be back where it always belonged... On my dresser</li>
    <li> I really like Happy by Clinique and this was the cheapest place I could find it. and I got it on time</li>
    <li> The fragrance is very happy.  What more can I say.  Fragrance can define&lt;br /&gt;the mood you are feeling.  Happy is the exact word for this fragrance.</li>
    <li> This has been the only scent I have worn for over 8 years! It is a fresh, crisp and clean scent.  I got it cheaper on Amazon than in the department stores.</li>
    <li> This product was exactly what it said it was and it was on time review asked for too much not much to say about something you are happy with</li>
    <li> this is a great price for Happy perfume. I looked at all the options and found this to be the best.</li>
    <li> Better value than buying in the department stores!</li>
    <li> Clinique&#x27;s Happy is the ONLY scent I ever wear.  I have used this product for years and CONSTANTLY receive compliments on it from both men AND women! I am in sales and see hundreds of people every week.  The clients I work with always smile and say they know if I have been to their office and missed them - they say the soft scent lingers!! I also agree with the scent staying on my clothes.  My 5 year old niece was at my mom&#x27;s house and asked if \\&quot;Aunt Kim\\&quot; was over because she smelled my cologne on something!  This scent is awesome.  Again, it is SOFT.  I have never had it \\&quot;turn against\\&quot; me.  My advice would be to try it at the Clinique counter to make sure it is something YOU like!</li>
    <li> It is all my wife will wear.  Smells good to me so buy with confidence. :)</li>
    <li> Classic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What can I say that hasn&#x27;t been said before? Wonderful bold, classy scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every time I wear it I get compliments. I don&#x27;t wear it everyday but it is definitely a go to for when I go out to dinner with friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This perfume lasts about 6-8 hours. I have owned for many years and when I run out I try to our purchase it again as soon as I can. This can be worn by all ages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend :)</li>
    <li> A+ product. Smells fresh and wonderful. This is the best price I can find anywhere.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my favorite perfume!</li>
    <li> my fault that it came so late, it was meant to be a Christmas present, but it got here a bit too late, but the family member was visiting a bit long and still received it</li>
    <li> wear it everyday...love the smell, not overwhelming and just a pleasant scent</li>
    <li> I have been wearing Happy for years (typically purchased at my local department store).  I have ordered it from Amazon a few times, the first time, the product was fine, this time, there is something wrong with the perfume.  It doesn&#x27;t last, not sure if it was old, or watered down (the package came sealed).</li>
    <li> Great product and it came in a timely manor, AWSOME....</li>
    <li> Light citrusy scent! Looove it! Lasts a while too!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife.  She was out of it.  She&#x27;s loved Happy by Clinique for years and was very pleased at Christmas when she opened this gift.</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume for my mother years ago for mothers day. Throughout high school, I found myself sneaking into her room and putting this on before school. It smelled so yummy! It was the perfect scent for me- subtle enough not to smoke out a room and young and feminine enough for me as a young teenager to wear. I would highly recommend buying this perfume for that special lady in your life (or yourself!) You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this perfume and will probably end up buying multiple bottles for years to come!&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Smells amazing!&lt;br /&gt;2. Light subtle scent&lt;br /&gt;3. Doesn&#x27;t smell like old lady&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. none!</li>
    <li> Great perfume, love the scent!</li>
    <li> I purchased this item from Amazon in May 2014. Some older reviews complain about receiving an imitation of poor quality, but I can attest that I received the real thing. I&#x27;ve used this perfume for years and gotten many compliments for its fresh, light aroma. It&#x27;s a good fragrance to wear to the office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I purchased this product again in January 2016, and it is just as good as ever. I can see from my purchasing history that a 3.4 fl.oz. bottle lasts about 1 1/2 years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Clinique Happy for years.  I get headaches with most fragrances, and can&#x27;t handle anything too strong.  This smells wonderful (very light, a tad citrusy), without being overpowering.</li>
    <li> Not good product from seller it was sour and seems that it is over the use due date.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume. It was totally worth the purchase. I got this the other day, the shipping was pretty fast. And, it was pretty well package. I would totally recommend anyone who wants to get it.</li>
    <li> My wife and I love this scent, which is very convenient for the both of us. Very nice and pleasant.</li>
    <li> This used to be my signature scent but I gave it a rest for several years...but I&#x27;m in love with Happy all over again. Especially at this price!!!</li>
    <li> This item was shipped promptly and received in GREAT condition. I thought it was a smaller bottle, but to my surprise it was a larger size! This was a great value!</li>
    <li> This is a very special perfume for me! A few years ago, my boyfriend asked a lady at work, what was that perfume she was wearing. She told him and he went to a near by perfume outlet store in Augusta, Georgia and brought it home to me! I LOVE this as much as I LOVE him! I am HAPPY to be wearing HAPPY anywhere we go! Because of him, I am HAPPY!!!</li>
    <li> I think everyone should have a fragrance.  I&#x27;ve worn this for years...it is my essence.  It is beautiful.  Light and clean yet it maintains its smell throughout the day.  Whenever I run out, I don&#x27;t feel right.  It is great for an everyday, all day fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;Have been buying through Amazon for the last 2 years and have NEVER received a fake/copy of this parfume.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing Happy for 15 years and it never fails to have a total stranger tell me how good I smell and ask what perfume I am wearing.... This happens at least twice a week!!! Get this for your wife or girlfriend, they will love it!! So will you!&lt;br /&gt;The smell of Happy is just so pretty!</li>
    <li> Love Happy, loved the price</li>
    <li> What can I say? This is my fragrance. Citrus floral keeps me happy all day. I buy this as a gift to myself every year. I hope Clinique never ends production.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite s, love the scent I get a lot of compliments , can&#x27;t go wrong with this perfume. .. it&#x27;s totally awesome</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted!</li>
    <li> This smell makes me happy... get it?  ba dum tissss</li>
    <li> Came in two days, my favorite perfume.</li>
    <li> Great buy. Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> The girlfriend loved it!</li>
    <li> My very favorite scent. Huge bottle. It will last for years and years. Great deal for under $50.</li>
    <li> This is my daughter&#x27;s favorite fragrance.  I bought it for her for Christmas this year.  She was very thankful for it!</li>
    <li> for someone who does not like an overpowering or floral or musky scent, this is perfect..light and refreshing! Love it!</li>
    <li> I am quite pleased with the 3.4 oz Clinique Happy I recently purchased.  Before I purchased it, I was a little concerned that the smell may not be what it was suppose to be because of &amp;#34;shelf life&amp;#34; and when you&#x27;re purchasing online that&#x27;s something you don&#x27;t know until you receive the product.  When I received it ... It was the fabulous smell that it has always been!  It was also about $20 cheaper than buying at my normal department store.  Shipping was fast as well.  Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> Is original. I&#x27;m really happy ith this purchase.</li>
    <li> Wife loves this stuff and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too bad either;)  Guess it depend on the person.  I&#x27;d go to a department store and try it before dropping money down on something that is just going to wind up in the back of your cabinet.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this smell.  Very good product.</li>
    <li> Great scent great price.</li>
    <li> Love the scent of this. Not overpowering.</li>
    <li> Gift for my sister! She loves it! Price was great! She says she get asked about the perfume she&#x27;s wearing. Great purchase!!</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance! Will buy my 4th bottle!</li>
    <li> Daughter&#x27;s favorite fragrance, nice size and price, came in time for Christmas!</li>
    <li> Great price!  Happy is the only fragrance I can wear as I am highly sensitive to scents/perfumes/lotions.  Love the light scent! This is a classic and will remain a classic.  Has a citrus undertone.</li>
    <li> I recently received this product and am so disappointed.  I have worn Happy for years and this is not Happy.  The box looks authentic, but this is either a knockoff or has a shelf-life issue.  I want a refund.</li>
    <li> Saved money and gave my wife the fragrance she loves. Better than buying flowers and lasts longer.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome deal because Clinique Happy makes me happier.  I mean 1oz to 1.5 oz cost 40-50 dollars in most drug stores and department. This should last me.</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite aroma for many years</li>
    <li> Excellent product and service. I have no problems.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite perfumes over the years.  I frequently get comments that I smell really good!  It has a nice clean &amp;#34;out of the shower&amp;#34; scent.</li>
    <li> Love the Scent, last all day, and i get nice complements. Make you Feel HAPPY!</li>
    <li> Great fragrance, especially if you like something light and refreshing. Just buy it at the department store... it&#x27;s sold for $49.50 at Clinique counters.</li>
    <li> I doubt if this product is original. I&#x27;ve been wearing this scent all my life and the one that I bought from amazon doesn&#x27;t last for that long at all.</li>
    <li> The color of the perfume was yellow.  It&#x27;s usually clear. Very odd</li>
    <li> This product was quite a bit cheaper than a department store would be. I would definitely recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> She loves this stuff. Still needing several words in order to complete my rating, blah blah blah blah blah blah</li>
    <li> The mocs and slippers were returned by the recipient of this purchase due to bad sizing issues.  How does the item get credited to my credit card?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She loved the Happy cologne</li>
    <li> Son bought for his girlfriend. Didn&#x27;t get a change to smell it but it was her favorite.</li>
    <li> great product fast shipping</li>
    <li> Perfume excellent, very good fragrance and lingers in the body and clothes all day also is very economical&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;very goob</li>
    <li> Love this perfume, it&#x27;s not bold but it stays with you all day and everyone says &amp;#34; you really spell good, what is the name of your perfume, and I am &amp;#34;Happy&amp;#34; to tell them!!  This is mine and my daughters perfume, which I got her some for her birthday and she was soooo &amp;#34;Happy&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> My mother loves this perfume and she is so happy I bought this for her on mothers day. I&#x27;m happy she&#x27;s happy!</li>
    <li> This is my all time most favorite parfume. It was surely the real deal. It smells outstanding on and it was purchased at 2/3 the cost.  It arrived in less than 4 day.</li>
    <li> This perfume smells terrific!!</li>
    <li> A lot of perfume for the money. Only a few dollars more for more than twice the size! Plus, it is my mom&#x27;s favorite scent, so it was the perfect gift for her.</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite. Bought as a gift. Cant go wrong.</li>
    <li> not sure if it was an old bottle or something but it wasn&#x27;t as aromatic as usual and the scent fades quite quickly....kind of a bummer...but the shipping was fast &amp; the price was nice...</li>
    <li> Delivered as requested. Good product.</li>
    <li> A gift for wife she loves it fast del.</li>
    <li> This is the best of this brand&#x27;s fragenaces. An ideal light scent Not very overpowering. Adsolutly give it a try!</li>
    <li> This is almost like a body spray, the scent disappears within an hour or so. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
    <li> When there is someone in your life that you haven&#x27;t gotten to know enough - buy her that favourite perfume she mentioned.</li>
    <li> Excelente fragancia. Recibi en muy buen estado. Estoy conforme con el mismo, y por tanto, he recomendado a mis amigos.</li>
    <li> bought this for my wife and she loves it, not alot more to say other than it was packaged nicely and did not leak or anything in the package.</li>
    <li> The shipment came timely and the price was right.  I really like this scent for every day- its not too anything; just clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> This item is a fake.  I bought a bottle here and the scent was not strong and faded quickly.  So I went to a local department store, bought a bottle there and compared the two.  The country where it is made on the bottom of the bottle is different.  The department store Happy is made in the U.S.A.  The one purchased here was made overseas - not U.S.A. and definitely not real \\&quot;Happy\\&quot;.  Be aware.</li>
    <li> Some of the best smelling perfume!</li>
    <li> great product, I am very glad to have him, is the best and original, thanks for the sale</li>
    <li> My wife has tried numerous scents, over the years, after being introduced to Happy.  She keeps returning to Happy.</li>
    <li> When she&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy!  I do love the scent - it&#x27;s refreshing and light!  Good price and free shipping!  Anytime I don&#x27;t have to pay for gas to buy something make me happy!</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite scent, can never go wrong with this.</li>
    <li> I am very sensitive to perfumes of any kind. I immediately get a migraine if it has any musk or &amp;#34;woodsy&amp;#34; type of smell to it.  I have loved and worn Happy for several years now. I ordered my last bottle from Amazon, and was very pleased with it.  I am still using it today!  It has remained one of the only perfumes that I can wear, and I will continue to buy from Amazon.  I store mine in a dark cabinet so there hasn&#x27;t been any discoloration whatsoever.  It would be hard for me to believe Amazon would sell a &amp;#34;knock-off&amp;#34; as someone previously suggested.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted and I did NOT have to go to the mall. This is the only way I shop anymore.</li>
    <li> Clinique happy has been a favorite of mine for a long time.  also you had the best price. thank you</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had such a hard time finding Clinique Happy in the stores lately. I was very please with the speedy delivery and knowing you stock this perfume I will definitely order again. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This is the best perfume I&#x27;ve ever use, happy does just that, it as always, has made me very happy!!!</li>
    <li> favorite cologne I just wish you could get samples have allergies like to smell it before I buy it</li>
    <li> Item did not arrive with the holiday gift message or gift wrap that I had indicated I wanted. Other  than that it was a very nice bargain for the size bottle and price charged.</li>
    <li> Wife loved it keeps me out of dog house lol</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift, so I don&#x27;t know!</li>
    <li> I love this perfume.  The smell is so fresh and clean and it&#x27;s a good price for the amount you get.</li>
    <li> i buy this for my daughter-in-law each year. Good buy</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift. Smells great.</li>
    <li> I would of giving this a five star but delivery did take too long.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that it was a good price and I&#x27;m very Happy with the product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product before, comes in original sealed packaging and as always smells amazing! I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume, and was able to find it a lot cheaper than I did at a local store. Well worth it!!</li>
    <li> I have been searching the Internet for the best price for weeks. Lots of companies have it but for $10-$20 more. So glad I found it here</li>
    <li> My wife loves it.  Has used this brand perfume for years.  I saw reviews about it being a knock off. She says it smells exactly the same and doesn&#x27;t think it is.</li>
    <li> Love this scent!!!  Great value!!!</li>
    <li> One of my ALL TIME favorite scents. Soft, feminine, fresh scent, perfect for summer</li>
    <li> Great product and great seller!</li>
    <li> Purchased as a Christmas present for my girlfriend. It was one of the items&lt;br /&gt;on her wish list. She loves the perfume and was extremely happy. The price&lt;br /&gt;through Amazon was about 30% lower than the same item at Macy&#x27;s, so I was&lt;br /&gt;extremely happy, too.</li>
    <li> The perfume smells extremely good and it lasts for long periods of time. The bottle is nice and easy to use</li>
    <li> Being a vocal music person, I normally totally avoid fragrances.  I bought this product a couple of years ago for my daughter because she indicated it was her favorite.  She used about 1/2 of the bottle over many months, then unfortunately she dropped the last 1/2 of the bottle onto a concrete floor and it broke.  This bottle is to replace the former and will be presented on her birthday on Jan 28.  I presume she will once again be delighted.</li>
    <li> One of my &amp;#34;go to&#x27;s,&amp;#34; I have loved this perfume since it was released!</li>
    <li> if everything is perfect for me because I get all in good condition and if it really is as lo expected</li>
    <li> I received this opened, in a box but there was no plastic seal. I thought it was supposed to be new?!</li>
    <li> excelent 100% bueno. las mejores marcas del mercado lo recomiendo con los ojos cerrados desde caracas venezuela&lt;br /&gt; recomiendo a toda la comunidad del mundo</li>
    <li> Daughter in law loves it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this perfume and three days later it was delivered! Great service!!! I love the fragranc it has such a lovely smell. I always check out perfume at the mall before I search the net! Amazon rocks!</li>
    <li> Perfume is good quality... just what I would expect from Clinique counter at my local store but saved me the trip.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume, (elegant yet not over potent to others around you, with a touch of class) so to be able to purchase it through Amazon was wonderful. Best Online purchase ever, and product came safely wrapped in big bubble wrap and a tiny box. Thank you.</li>
    <li> No issues and was as good and fresh as we buy at Dillards.</li>
    <li> Subtle fragrance,  one my husband doesn&#x27;t complain about.  sprayed on my body after shower.  lasts all day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Happy and she was</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing happy for over 10 years.  I&#x27;m just adicted to it&#x27;s citrusy scent.  I get compliments on it all the time.  If you&#x27;ve never tried it, it NOT a heavy scent.  It&#x27;s light and stays with you all day.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed for a great price. Bought this for my wife for her birthday &amp; she loved it.</li>
    <li> My sister was looking for, since a long time is  her favorite perfume, and smell so good, i think is excellent!</li>

    <li> I have used Clinique Happy for over 10 years and have only 1 time had to ship the product back due to the smell.  I think I received another bad batch as the product has a funny smell again.  I don&#x27;t know how to send it back and I would like to do this and get another bottle since it is paid for.</li>
    <li> good stuff made her horny!</li>
    <li> how wonderful cologne the fragance is a little old however this is still my prefer one the are no perfume like this</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my mother for her birthday and she loved it! Product was authentic, smelled delicious, and arrived quickly. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because while the plastic wrap was perfectly flat, the cardboard box had big lines in it as if it had been crushed. Only a minor problem though! Smells great and the seller is fast and reputable. Thanks for helping me make my mom&#x27;s birthday great!</li>
    <li> It was a gift for my daughter and  she loved it.</li>

    <li> came in original packaging, but still doesn&#x27;t smell as strong as it does when I purchase it from Macy&#x27;s...  same scent but doesn&#x27;t last as long.  ;-(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took a shot, it&#x27;ll do until I can run down to Macy&#x27;s again.</li>
    <li> The product is just as I expected!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and it is a scent I am familiar with, so I knew I would love it. Yes.</li>
