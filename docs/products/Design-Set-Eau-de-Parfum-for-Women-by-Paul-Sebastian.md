<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been wearing this cologne for years.  I get frequent compliments.</li>
    <li> I have used this product from the time it was only available in Bon Marche.  It is a most pleasant fragrance, not overpowering, or heavy.  Have enjoyed using it for years.  So glad it is still available.</li>
    <li> gift for a friend, she was so happy to get it, one of her faves.</li>
    <li> Design has been my favorite for years. Its fragrance will always arouse thoughts of Mother in my daughters&#x27; minds and of Teacher in my students&#x27; minds.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance</li>
    <li> Brought for the wife. This is one of her favorites. She says it&#x27;s the real thing, not a knockoff.</li>
    <li> My Mom&#x27;s signature perfume. It&#x27;s too strong for me but that&#x27;s okay. She just loves this perfume.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift last year for Christmas, and every time I see the recipient, she&#x27;s wearing this scent.  It&#x27;s floral and light, but not subtle (nor offensive).  She likes it, and this scent was recommended to me by several other people.</li>
    <li> my favorite cologne is old school but I love it!</li>
    <li> It seems like a fake. No plastic paper packing, it might have been easily openned before it reached me. And it has strong alcohol ordor, the scent fade away quickly after 1 or 2 hours.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance, I get so many compliments when I wear it. always shipped out fast I will continue buying this fragrance from now on</li>
    <li> Love Design perfum spray, been using this for years!  Never disappoints me!  Perfect go to on a regular day, nice clean fresh scent with hint of linens.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0007D60KY Design By Paul Sabestain 3.4 Oz Fine Perfume Spray for Women]] This fragrance is such a lilting, clean, fresh scent.  I love to wear fragrance and this is one of my personal favorites! Design by Paul Sebastian is the one which people will stop me and ask me what I am wearing.  I have had several people purchase this fragrance for themselves after experiencing the refreshing scent that I wear.  Men and women are equally attracted to this fragrance.  I LOVE IT!  It has been my one of 3 scents that I wear.  It is by far the most popular one due to all the people who comment on it&#x27;s fresh fragrance.  I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a light, fresh fragrance.</li>
    <li> Good price and large bottle, was shipped as promised.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because of  the reviews and because of all the good reviews i decided to try it. Im a very happy camper. I walk down the street people stop me,my male co-worker says it&#x27;s his favorite of all the purfum&#x27;s i wear...</li>
    <li> My wife could no longer buy this product at Nordstrom&#x27;s or Macy&#x27;s.  So I tried Amazon.  There it was.  I bought it, it was here in 3 day&#x27;s.  Happy wife!!</li>
    <li> I have used this fragrance for years.  It is the one that doesn&#x27;t bother my allergies.  It is a light fragrance and last all day.</li>
    <li> My mother always liked this Perfume.  I decided to order another bottle so so she would have enough for the future.  It is not expensive but it smells great.</li>
    <li> The Design perfum spray in the 3.4 ounce size is a wonderful fragrance that has been my signature for years. It is a wonderful buy. Was delivered promptly and I will definitely reorder.    DGG</li>
    <li> very nice, great price, very large bottle smells wonderful, its a great Christmas gift</li>
    <li> the wife&#x27;s favorite excelent price</li>
    <li> rec&#x27;d this perfume with it leaking everywhere-the lid does not even fit the bottle.</li>
    <li> I have used Design for years, paying $50. or so at a crack.  When I found this at Amazon, I was ecstatic!  So affordable!  People always ask me what scent I wear, It smells shower fresh all day!</li>
    <li> This is the only perfume I have worn for the past 15 years. I always receive compliments on how beautiful I smell. It is the only perfume I will ever wear.</li>
    <li> I love the mens P.S. Its so intoxicating....but this seems to \\&quot;flowery\\&quot; for me. I&#x27;m used to Clean and Fendi brands, which are so opposite.   But this is lingering and all I smell is FLOWERS!! It reminds me of an \\&quot;oldie\\&quot;......Lily of the Valley.  I&#x27;ll just give it away. It was a good price, and will cost me more to send back.</li>
    <li> I love this classic perfume.  It&#x27;s all I use.  I&#x27;m so glad I was able to get it on Amazon for such a great price.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume and it smells wonderful! I always get compliments when I wear this perfume. it is really strong and nice! GREAT STUFF!!</li>
    <li> complments everytime i wear it !</li>
    <li> My boyfriend finds this to be a alluring fragence. No overbearing lite and warm. I have many men ask the name so they can order it for thier wives.</li>
    <li> The supply may be old because the fragrance was poor!</li>
    <li> As expected, I purchase this quite frequently and the price is great.</li>
    <li> She loves it, it&#x27;s not the newest scent but its a classic womens scent. Not overbearing, subtle but you know its there.</li>
    <li> I have used Design for 21 years love it, it&#x27;s me don&#x27;t change it</li>
    <li> Good price for a favorite</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this perfume by Paul Sebastian.  It&#x27;s a nice light scent and not overpowering.  I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on it.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> i have been using this for at least 15 years, it is getting harder to find, but count on amazon for carrying it and also having it at a great price!  i ordered two just in case they discontinue it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Design for several years.  Have tried others, but find I like this the best.  Soft and not too sweet.  This was a GREAT buy!</li>
    <li> Wonderful, soft, sensual, clean fragrance. Fast shipping, good protective packaging. Good price, would buy again.</li>
    <li> I buy Design perfume every few months. I have so many compliments when I wear this fragrance, it is a light scent and always pleasant to be around.</li>
    <li> A clean and wonderful perfume</li>
    <li> I love this parfum spray. I have trouble finding it in stores. It is always sold out. I have&lt;br /&gt;used it for over ten years. It was a good price at amazone and I got it fast. That is why I&lt;br /&gt;shop at amazone, they really get your order to you fast.Thanks, Carol</li>
    <li> Yes, this is the fragrance I have been looking for! I used it for years and it is my favorite. :)</li>
    <li> I took a chance and purchased \\&quot;Design\\&quot; by Paul Sebastian because of the glowing reviews. I was told by someone that it reminded them of an old lady in church. I found it kinda strong, and I agree it has an old fashioned thing going on.I guess thats due to the warm musky notes.</li>
    <li> This is the best cologne. The scent is mild, sexy and welcoming to one&#x27;s nose.</li>
    <li> its one of the best long lasting cheap perfumes. I love this perfume and recommend it to anybody. I got one for everyone I know.</li>
    <li> Great price and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I HAVE BEEN WEARING THIS SCENT FOR YEARS. I JUST ORDER IT ONLINE NOW INSTEAD OF SEARCHING FOR IT IN STORES. WONDERFUL FRAGRANCE WHICH LASTS ALL DAY. GREAT PRICE. FAST SHIPPING. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
    <li> Smells great! I love the very clean scent. Price isn&#x27;t bad either, though sometimes I see it on sale too.</li>
    <li> Exactly what she wanted at a good price. She was extremely satisfied with the product and package and will buy again in due time.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this scent. I think it is ok but whatever she likes!!</li>
    <li> This was a present for my aunt.  She really loves this stuff.  I am not crazy about it, (I am more of a Pavlova fan) but as long as she gets what she likes and it makes her happy, then everything is cool.</li>
    <li> This item here is the greatest and it smell so sweet when I spray it on thanks for getting it to me again.</li>
    <li> My wife is very happy with the perfume.&lt;br /&gt;Al Francesco</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find Design perfume in the stores anymore and was so disappointed. Was so glad to find it here. The price was great &amp; the quality just as expected. Would definitely buy from here again...great price, product &amp; fast reliable shipping. Thanks for excellent customer service.</li>
    <li> Does not smell as I thought, but it is still OK.</li>
    <li> Very refreshing and light scent with a little citrus.  I would recommend this product as I&#x27;ve been wearing for years.  I many compliments on the scent.</li>
    <li> I gifted it. She has used it for many years.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the product &amp; how quickly I received it.I look forward to doing business with you in the future.</li>
    <li> my sister smells so good wearing this....I got her two bottles for Christmas</li>
    <li> I am likewise surprised at the bad reviews on this. This is quite good! I am sampling from a manufacturer&#x27;s vial labeled \\&quot;PS Design Fine Parfum.\\&quot; This is a very old-school 1980s oriental. If you like that style, get your hands on it! I&#x27;m glad that I did.</li>
    <li> Design is an excellent little secret, as it seems to be less popular with the younger generation. People seem to always ask about it, as it is strikingly unique, but not at all overpowering. Try a sample if you can find some at the department store and see what I mean!</li>
    <li> im not one for perfumes..my nose is really sensitive to smells...so when i found this i was so excited. the scent is light yet distinct. i get soo many compliments on it :)</li>
    <li> Great buy I luv Design and almost gone from the last time I purchased from Amazon will order again good deal for the price! I like this Eau De Perfume because it has a distinct smell different from the normal scents out there it makes me feel at my age feel feminine and a little bit like I did in my twenties and thirties with a spring in my step. It&#x27;s light not heavy but subtle that is why I like it does not empower the person next to you but just gives a whiff of the scent. Paul Sebastian for Women means what is says it;s for women not men. I like the design of the bottle  simple and I was very lucky to say the bottle held up for years two at least  and never failed to spray. That tells you that a glass bottle is strong and the it&#x27;s not a fake scent.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite.  My son-in-law actually uses the men&#x27;s cologne, same smell.  Guess he has good taste.  Ha.  Hope they never stop making it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  I got a whiff of it 20+ years ago and asked the woman what it was.  I&#x27;ve not used anything since.  Its unusual enough, but is light and clean.</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite perfume! The only one I have worn for over 15 years. So to find it at such a good price is awesome! Thank you! :)</li>
    <li> I have worn this scent for more years than I care to count and I have always received compliments on it. It is not a heavy scent nor is it a childish or flowery scent. For me, it offers the perfect combination of &amp;#34;right for the boardroom&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;right for the bedroom.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Okay, I&#x27;m an older woman who loves a nice, clean fragrance and Design by Paul Sebastian is just that. It&#x27;s not what I&#x27;d call citrus, but it&#x27;s not heavy on the spice either. It&#x27;s just a nice all &#x27;round, use everyday, lots of levels perfume.   It seems to change moods the longer I wear it, it starts out lively and bright but as the hours go by, it mellows out, just like me!!   There are so many nice scents today, and this is one of them but it is also familiar to me for some reason. A touch of Georgio, perhaps?   Anyway, I&#x27;m so glad I decided to try it. The 3.4 ounces is a great value. I intend to keep it in the refrigerator to preserve it&#x27;s lovely fragrance as it will last me a long time.</li>
    <li> I loved the price on this one.  This site had the best price for the 3 parfum sprays.  Friend delighted on all her choices now.</li>
    <li> I love this scent.  I get compliments every time I wear this.</li>
    <li> Still my favorite fragrance.  Seller shipped promptly.</li>
    <li> I bought this parfum because it was such a bargain and had so many great reviews.  Now I know why, it smells so good!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m never disappointed. When I purchase from you. I will be buying again in the future. The prices are gr8t. I recommend to other consumers purchase from them. Thanks again!</li>
    <li> Design is a great scent and I love it. The price is better than the local department store for the very same product!</li>
    <li> A very appealing , but not overwhelming fragrance that is not a burden on your Christmas budget and pleasing to your nose.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume, My Aunt use to wear this all the time &amp; it use to be real expensive! I get so many compliments on this!</li>
    <li> Bought this Perfume based on reviews and price. Supprised my wife with it and she was excited til she smelt it. I must agree, its not the best scents ive smelt and honestly i wouldnt be attracted to a woman wearing it. SMells kinda of oldish, Musky. I think i will stick to getting her the expensive ones she actually asked for and smelt before hand. Sorry :-/</li>
    <li> I always wear this and have so many people always asking me what it is.</li>
    <li> and I LOVE IT.  LOVE IT.  LOVE IT.  can&#x27;t ever get enough of the scent - says &amp;#34;beautiful&amp;#34; with even the slightest hint of it</li>
    <li> A very clean, not too imposing scent that will attract alot of attention and questions like \\&quot;what are you wearing and where can I get some?\\&quot;</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! Nice smell. My daughter loves this. I bought this for her for Christmas to put in her stocking</li>
    <li> LOVED the deal I received and the product was EXACTLY what I wanted..THANK YOU!! I was looking for the BEST price but, was nervous that the product wouldn&#x27;t be 1st rate. I was PLEASANTLY surprised when I QUICKLY received my order and it was PERFECT. THANKS AGAIN!</li>
    <li> I first discovered this parfume from my mom. I feel in love with it. Then it became hard to find. So thankfully amazon carries it and the price is unbelievable, as I was paying $30.00 for a 1.7 ounce bottle in the store. I wear it everyday and I have at least 2 people everyday ask me what I&#x27;m wearing. Both men and women ask all the time and have even purchased it for themselves or their wives. I highly recommend this product, you will never want to wear anything else again.</li>
    <li> I tried this once from a friend that was selling the perfume and nobody bought it from him because people never heard of the name. I&#x27;m not driven by a name, but by quality. This is the most amazing fresh clean scent. I used to work close to people, and the customers always said how clean I smelled. I&#x27;ll that compliment over anything else. Since then, I&#x27;ve always had a bottle with me no matter what else I may try. I always come back to this. I don&#x27;t like the Casual scent, Design is for me, the best scent. I love it.</li>
    <li> My Sister In Law gave me my first bottle Design 8 years ago and I loved it.  I have tried other scents, but I keep coming back to Design.  No matter where I go, or who I see, someone comments on the wonderful smell.  Great perfume!</li>
    <li> When I first noticed this on a customer of mine I asked what it was and she was kind enough to tell me. I immediately ordered some just hoping it would smell the same on me and it does. I get compliments on it every time I am wearing it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of this perfume, it smells very old fashioned/strong to me. However, this was a big hit with my mother! She loved it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn this fragrance for more than 20 years and it is the BEST.  I often receive compliments and inquiries when I wear it.  It is not always easy to find and I&#x27;m truly grateful that you carry it.</li>
    <li> I have so may beautiful scents and most of them are much more expensive than Design but I do believe this is my favorite!.  I have worn it for years and usually get compliments every time I use this beautiful scent!  I knew I was getting &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; but I figured I would just use my other perfumes until it dawned on me how much I miss it. I don&#x27;t think any woman can go wrong with Design!</li>
    <li> my favorite perfume from when I was in high school,I love it:)  now I can use it everyday, not just for special occasions</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price! I remember paying over $50 for it at the department stores.</li>
    <li> I love the perfume, and I like the price too!</li>
    <li> It has been my everyday scent for years....and love it....I get compliments all the time but does not over power</li>
    <li> You made my wife a very happy camper with this!</li>
    <li> Worst smelling perfume ive ever bought.. since the 80&#x27;s this has been my favorite scent. Will never purchase Design online again.. it smells like you are spraying alcohol.. awful.. will keep buying from department stores..</li>
    <li> My all time favorite perfume! I have worn this perfume for many years and I also seem to get a compliment on the scent</li>
    <li> This bottle was larger than what I can usually afford to buy but, it doesn&#x27;t smell the same as the smaller, more expensive bottle I&#x27;ve bought before.  I should have known that this size, for the price, was too good to be true.</li>
    <li> This is my Wife&#x27;s go to scent.  She would put this on just before bed so that she smells great in the morning.  I enjoy the way this smells.</li>
    <li> This spray does not smell like the store bought product and does not last long.</li>
    <li> My mom asked for perfume for her birthday.  Two of my female coworkers recommended this perfume as a \\&quot;classic\\&quot; scent that doesn&#x27;t smell like an old lady, but also isn&#x27;t real fruity like the stuff kids wear these days.  Mom had never heard of it before, but when she opened it up and gave it a smell, she liked it and both of my sisters approved, too!</li>
    <li> Design has been around for a long time. I like to use it every now and then, kind of brings back fond memories. Very clean scent.</li>
    <li> I love the scent of Design by Paul Sebastian for Women.  Would Paul consider going international (say to Israel) as well?</li>
    <li> This is my mother in law favorite parfum !! She loves it!! I brought for her Birthday! for the price i got her 2 bottles!!</li>
    <li> What a great fragrance</li>
    <li> I love this perfume and buy it all the time. This is first time from Amazon and I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s authentic. It doesn&#x27;t have the same exact smell.</li>
    <li> I remember loving this the first few times I bought it!&lt;br /&gt;I just bought it again, 15+ years later... I think my tastes have changed, or the formula has.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve asked a few friends to &#x27;smell me&#x27; :) since wearing it, they SAY it&#x27;s &#x27;pretty&#x27;, but...&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not saying it stinks! Not by a long shot!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just not &#x27;me&#x27; anymore.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my wife for Christmas and it&#x27;s a winner. This fragrance is very pleasant. I took the chance without smelling and based all my decision making on these reviews. All I can say is wow! Great price too.</li>
    <li> This was bought as a gift for a lady friend of mine.  I haven&#x27;t as yet gotten a whiff  !</li>
    <li> I have loved this scent for years.  Now it is so inexpensive!  Very happy!</li>
    <li> I think some of the original smell is gone, but it is still a nice perfume.</li>
    <li> I am used to paying more for the same size bottle. I was completely surprised when the same size came in the mail for a fraction of the cost</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn this scent for over z0 years.  It&#x27;s so nice to find it at a discount price.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> LOVE DESIGN PERFUME!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is the real Design. I was worried with some reviews saying it wasn&#x27;t . I have worn this for 15 yrs. it just smells good on me &amp; to me. I try all the new, hot selling scents &amp; nothing smells remotely as good as this. I get compliments from men &amp; women when I wear it. I have PRIME , &amp; always by from &amp;#34;Amazon&amp;#34;, not others sellers, unless Amazon is fulfilling the order. This is real &amp; I&#x27;ve bought a few other perfumes that were the real ones and they were all sold by Amazon ( not another seller on Amazon) . So , I would stick to buying it from them, I&#x27;ve had no fakes or problems.&lt;br /&gt; The Design was a good buy &amp; smells great, arrived in a couple days. Couldn&#x27;t be happier. This stuff lasts sooo long on, I can smell it on coats a week later. It lasts all days on your skin, &amp; the next morning you can still smell it, if you didn&#x27;t shower before bed. Love it. Great scent, Amazon had a great price &amp; it&#x27;s REAL!!&lt;br /&gt;JENN ~</li>
    <li> Great price for the old stand by. Gift loved. Compliments always when wearing the fragrance. Good standby for a gift too.</li>
    <li> This smells so bad will have to throw it away. Instant headache after smelling. One of the worst smelling perfume I have ever experienced. I bought it because of the good reviews. Big mistake.</li>
    <li> This Perfume has been my trademark, well forever...... I can be walking down the street and someone will say &amp;#34;Your wearing Design aren&#x27;t you?&amp;#34;  And I will have put it on early in the morning...I love it</li>
    <li> I order it for her birthday and she asks for more because she gets so many complements on it. It is her favorite.</li>
    <li> this was a good buy for the size.  I will purchase again.  smells good and refreshing not heavy and sweet.</li>
    <li> Just as described. Perfect transaction.</li>
    <li> This smells perfect. It actually smells better than the last bottle I bought in the store. I always get compliments on it everytime I wear it. I have both women AND men chase me down asking what it is I am wearing every single time I wear it. I wore it to work and soon 5 or 6 ladies in the department were also wearing it. Now our entire department smells like a big bottle of Design.</li>
    <li> It smelled stale. I would NOT recommend purchasing this. And you can NOT return it so that is really annoying!</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume. Great light scent that stays on a very long time. I always receive many compliments whenever I wear it. It is my signature perfume!</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance. It was subtle not to invasive, pleasant.  I wear it all the time no matter where I am going.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this fragrance for years.  It is not overpowering but everyone who passes by compliments me on the scent.  The price is a steal too!</li>
    <li> Love , fast delivery !!!</li>
    <li> If your partner has a good taste, he will give you a compliment every time you wear it. I even have people at work asking me the name. I sometimes combine it with Chopard Wish and it makes it very elegant and unique.</li>
    <li> I love this parfum.  It is my favorite for everyday wear.  It smells so clean and light.  I always get compliments on how good it smells.</li>
    <li> This smells great and is a fraction of the price as seen at Wally world.  My wife loves it, thats a good thing</li>
    <li> This scent smells like a dated 1970s cheap perfume. I don&#x27;t even know what to do with it now. I don&#x27;t see how it could benefit anyone&#x27;s or anything&#x27;s olfactory senses. Using it would only be torture to any creature. What does one do with a bad perfume? I&#x27;m open for suggestions.</li>
    <li> I have bought this product in the past and love it. This was a more reasonsable price and I got it fast. Package was in perfect shape and I am very satisified.</li>
    <li> A nice smell that lasts all day.  I have been buying Design for 20 years and this is a great price.</li>
    <li> I have always love this. Great price!</li>
    <li> The price was good, but this is not real Design. It doesn&#x27;t smell like it at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this everywbere! Never thought to look here. I&#x27;m sooooo happy.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing Design for almost 20 years and it has never failed me. I get so many compliments on a daily basis on what perfume I am wearing. The smell is not overpowering or too strong, it is just right. One time I was told I smelled like the inside of an Indian temple that was meant to be taken as a compliment. I just hope they never discontinue this perfume, because would be hard to find anything to replace it.</li>
    <li> Design is a lovely, soft, feminine fragrance that I enjoy wearing, but it only suits me during the winter months. During the summer it is too sweet, and I can&#x27;t handle the scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this perfume for more than 20 years and love it. My kids won&#x27;t let me change to anything else as this is &amp;#34;my smell.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Perfume came quickly and in good condition.  Quite a bargain compared to retail prices.</li>
    <li> My favorite also was cheaper than some other places.</li>
    <li> This is the only perfume that I can wear because of my allergies and everyone comments on how nice it smells on me!  I love it!</li>
    <li> This perfume is terrific! I must say is smells heavenly! The reviews that you are reading are not wrong! It is light, but pretty enough to be able to smell it! The first day I wore it I got compliments from everyone that went near me. My fiance didn&#x27;t want to let go of me! It does last, even if you yourself can&#x27;t smell it. You&#x27;ve just become used to the smell! It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted and more!&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that I could give a heads up on is the cap isn&#x27;t the best so be careful when opening! Otherwise, A++ Amazon!</li>
    <li> It too still has same clean fragrance, but doesn&#x27;t linger as long.</li>
    <li> Same simple elegant design.  I&#x27;ve used this fragrance for many, many years now.  Thank you for carrying this product line still and making it available at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> The price wasnt any cheaper than the stores and this is so old it mainly smells like alcohol!  Not worth it!</li>
    <li> Design is one of the fragrances for w hich I receive the most compliments.  I&#x27;m very glad I found it on Amazon since the store no longer carries it.</li>
    <li> I wear this cologne all the time so I know the scent. Some discount places either buy old stock or knockoff cologne and its not the same, That IS NOT the case with this product. It it a great value and I will continue to use this seller.</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because I love the perfume, it was at a good price and so easy to have it sent to my home..I would recommend it to anyone who loves the scent..</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume...it is always&lt;br /&gt;packed real good, never have I received&lt;br /&gt;any broken bottles...Thanks Amazon...</li>
    <li> A number of years ago, I received some Design as a gift, and I loved it. When I ran out and decided to get some more, I didn&#x27;t want to pay department store prices, so I searched for it on Amazon and found a really good deal. The product was fresh and high-quality--exactly what I would have gotten at a department store but for a fraction of the cost.</li>
    <li> Whenever I wear this people are always asking me what kind of cologne am I wearing and where they can buy it. A very nice clean smell. Have worn for years.</li>
    <li> Sadly this is a fake, Wife has worn for years,I thought the price was to good to be true,it was. Fragrance was very similar but diminished rapidly. Took the wife a few days to nail it as fake.Ultimately she was correct.</li>
    <li> Product was delivered on time and as expected. This is one of my favorites, it&#x27;s sexy and I have been wearing it for years.</li>
    <li> My wife has been wearing this for about 25 years - we both love it. Wonderful pleasing aroma - lots of compliments!!</li>
    <li> The bottle I received was not design perfume ..even the bottle looked fake. It smelled horrible and was a much darker color than the real thing. I would not order from here again. If you read the description its almost like they are expecting people to question the quality.  It&#x27;s a rip off.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t ever go wrong with this scent.  I get more compliments on this than I do my Dolce &amp; Gabbanna Light Blue which is two or three times higher in price.  This seller also great, shipped it quickly and in tip top shape.  THANKS</li>
    <li> So I have worn this fragrance for years.  Recently I was at a hospital and was told by a maintenance man who I had seen two days in a row that he followed me because I smelled so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All who know me, know this is my scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for having this available and at such a great price!</li>
    <li> Item is as described. I love it. Have worn the perfume for years. Soft sweet fragrance not over powering or strong.</li>
    <li> Always get compliments when i wear this</li>
    <li> The most beautiful smell!  Reminds me of a night blooming jasmine.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, excellent Amazon service and delivery, excellent price.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume...smells beautiful!</li>
    <li> It is always well liked by the people I gift it to.  I like the scent.</li>
    <li> This is the wife&#x27;s favorite. 1/3 the price at a retail store.</li>
    <li> Excellent, I have worn this for years and it is not strong. Soft and does not knock people down around you.Great to find online.</li>
    <li> Still one of my most favorite perfumes ever.  Design perfume has been around for at least 25 years and it has never changed.  The scent always reminds me of waking up during the holidays.  My mom always wore it so it gives me that happy sense of home.  It is a deep scent, not fruity, but not floral either.  It is beautiful and a small bit goes a long way.  I will continue wearing this for years to come.  It is reasonably priced and the formula stays consistent.  I absolutely love it and find myself spraying it on my curtains in my bathroom so that I can smell it as I am getting ready for work. It does have a spray top so it is very easy to put on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I paid full price for this item and was not obligated to leave any type of review whether it be positive or negative.  I wrote this review in order to assist the general consumer make an informative decision when purchasing a product that they can&#x27;t touch prior***</li>
    <li> My mother wears this fragrance all the time. There was an obvious, watered down lack of quality. I thought I was getting a great deal because this is her signature scent but it was a dud.</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume for my grandma, and the size I priced at the store was $34.99 for a 1.7oz. I bought this one for half that price and double the size! I was very satisfied when I received. Definitely worth the price!!</li>
    <li> This is my wife&#x27;s favorite and mine too. Will purchase more in the future. Thanks for quick shipment. Recommend your site.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Will buy again.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love it and the price is so much cheaper than the department stores</li>
    <li> This is the only perfume that I buy and, use....If you like a light scent that last with you all day and, are wanting compliments and, people are asking me what is the name of that perfume you are wearing I love it....</li>
    <li> I have loved Design for 20 years and am identified by my friends because of it.  My former employment&#x27;s other employees&lt;br /&gt;always asked to hug me because of the perfume I wear and remark that I have just been in a room because the scent lingers</li>
    <li> Love it, love it and love it again.  Nice size bottle and I&#x27;m order this again real soon.</li>
    <li> Love it and good service!!</li>
    <li> This was great.  The product was as described and smells nice.  Well done to the people that make and distribute this.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift. The price was the cheapest anywhere! If you are a design fan thsi is the palce to buy it.</li>
    <li> A WONDERFUL SCENT!  I PURCHASE THIS EVERY YEAR FOR SPECIAL PEOPLE.  MICHAEL EAST</li>
    <li> My wife loves this. Great price for the size. Can&#x27;t find it this in a store for the price.</li>
    <li> A great light fragrance.</li>
    <li> this has been her favorite scent for at least 15 years.  It&#x27;s subtle, and sexy, and sophisticated.  I&#x27;m glad they still make it and at a nice price.  This bottle will last her for quite a while.  I&#x27;ll be back in a few years to try to order some more.</li>
    <li> Got this for my mother, she loves it!!!!</li>
    <li> My mom has purchased this for many years and has always received complements. It has always stayed nice smelling on her. Does not smell great on me!</li>
    <li> I was specifically looking for carnation scent.  While it was represented as carnation based, I smell no carnation.  It is a lovely scent, but not for what I was searching.  A carnation scent!</li>
    <li> My favorite. Great price.</li>
    <li> Great product and transaction!  Thanks!!</li>
    <li> This has a very nice clean fragrance and a long staying time.  I have isses with strong perfumes and can wear this one in confidence it won&#x27;t set off my alergy. I would recommend this to any age.</li>
    <li> Great price and my mom loves it</li>
    <li> My wife has been trying to find this perfume and was delighted with the gift.  We will be back again.</li>
    <li> wife loves the smell. She says its not too strong like the others she has but its perfect!</li>
    <li> I love this perfume.  It is absolutely the most attention getting subtle smell.  Guys love it!&lt;br /&gt;I always hear &amp;#34;wow!  who smells so good ?!&amp;#34;  and then they discover me with my &amp;#34;Design&amp;#34; on</li>
    <li> I LOVE my bottle of DESIGN.</li>
    <li> This Product is even better the the last bottle I got.  I love this scent.</li>
    <li> my mom loves this too</li>
    <li> I have worn this fragrence for 20 years and still have people stop me and ask what it is.  I never get tired of it.  It is a soft woodsy, floral scent that everyone loves.</li>
    <li> Not sure it is the original product made by Paul Sebastian.  The scent was weak not like the original.  I have used Design for over 23 years and this one smelled very weak.</li>
    <li> My mother loves this perfume, It made the perfect Christmas gift for my daughter to give to her grandmother for Christmas.</li>
    <li> Very light pleasent smell</li>
    <li> My mom&#x27;s favorite perfume! It&#x27;s the same as always, arrived on time, and we&#x27;re happy with it.</li>
    <li> when I recieved the bottle it was about 1 inch less perfume in it from the top. Also this is my favorite perfume but this bottle doesn&#x27;t quite smell like what it is suppose to. One more thing is the cap doesn&#x27;t even fit right to the bottle,</li>
    <li> this is great  smell. .  I really like the way it goes with everything.  And its a great deal as well</li>
    <li> I was so disappointed. Bought this due to great reviews but the scent isn&#x27;t even nice. It smells cheap and is. The cap on the bottle doesn&#x27;t open properly. I don&#x27;t even want to use it for a room spray! Buyers beware.</li>
    <li> Very nice.  Bought as a gift for a friend.  She is fond of this scent.</li>
    <li> I have used &amp;#34;Design&amp;#34; by Paul Sebastian for many years and love it!!  Not available in stores but only online.</li>
    <li> The store I normally bought this from no longer carries it. I was thrilled to find it here and the price was A LOT less than what I paid in the local store !  I got it really fast to top it off !!  What&#x27;s not to love ?!!!</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for</li>
    <li> Best price around.  I met someone on the Bart train with this cologne.  She told me the name of her fragrance and I&#x27;ve been wearing it for over 2-yrs. now.  My husband was buying me the expensive cologne from Macy&#x27;s but I prefer this one.  It&#x27;s a keeper and you only need to spray once or it&#x27;ll be overwhelming for others in the room.</li>
    <li> My one and only perfume I wear and I will wear!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been wearing this perfume since 1996 and I can&#x27;t seem to find another one that I can love!&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love this smell and I get a lots of compliments!!!&lt;br /&gt;When I started dating my husband 7years ago, he gave me some perfume as a gift but I had to tell him right away I don&#x27;t wear anything else but design.. Lol I felt bad for him but I didn&#x27;t want to wear perfume that I don&#x27;t like even for a man that I really liked...&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, Five stars for sure for this price and quality!!!!!</li>
    <li> My wife loves Design.</li>
    <li> I get the most compliments when I wear this perfume. I have worn a lot of different perfumes.But it is nice to have so many people ask me what perfume I&#x27;m wearing.</li>
    <li> This was bought as a gift for someone that loves this scent. She were quite pleased, and tells me she has gotten compliments on the scent. Must be good!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for this locally but moons seems to carry it anymore.  So I took a chance and bought this.  It is just what my wife wanted for Christmas.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this fragrance for years.  I love it.  I&#x27;ve also discovered that it&#x27;s different on everyone, so no matter who uses it, you will be unique.  Every now and them, I&#x27;ll stopped using it, for a break, and have always gone back to it when I compliment someone on their perfume.  This is a great perfume to have in your daily arsenal!</li>
    <li> Bought for my Mom who has been wearing this scent for years. She&#x27;s afraid that they will stop making DESIGN so she stocks up every year. She is always getting compliments from strangers about how great she smells when she wears it. One caveat: everyone has a different body chemistry so the scent does not smell the same on everyone. I tried wearing it and the smell nauseated me. If possible, try the scent for a day before purchasing.</li>
    <li> As expected.  Quality product with swift delivery.</li>
    <li> Closest to a  really old and famous French scent by Guerlin called &amp;#34;Apres l&#x27;Ondee&amp;#34;, but a fraction of the price for the French cologne.</li>
    <li> Was not what I expected, did not smell like sample I had smelled.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry</li>
    <li> This is the only perfume that I were, due to sensitivity to odors and scents.</li>
    <li> The scent of Design is not overpowering, And, it isn&#x27;t like every other perfume on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get compliments when I where this perfume. I used to try other fragrances from time to time, but in the past few years I stick to Design.</li>
    <li> Im dumbfounded by the reviews on this perfume, because most of them say it has a clean fresh scent. So i purchased it and it smells very musty and thick. nothing clean, fresh or crisp about it. I took it to work to see if if was me and asked how others thought it smelled and they said, old, musty, nasty, etc. out of 23 people, not a one said clean or fresh. So Im confused by the reviews here.</li>
    <li> I like for ever time.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again</li>
    <li> This is a lite fragrance and at a very affordable price!!  Much better than WalMart and I thought that was a good price.  You can&#x27;t beat Amazon&#x27;s prices.  Just got back from the grocery store where a lady stopped me  and asked me what fragrance I was wearing.  Said she had to ask because it smelled so good.</li>
    <li> I have tried rinsing the nozzle under hot water but I think this bottle might be defective. It is difficult to get a spray out.</li>
    <li> Since I was a little kid my mom wore this perfume.  I loved it as a child and I still love it at the age of 40</li>
    <li> This fragrance is definitely fresh and clean. It almost reminds me of a fresh linen type of fragrance that bounces from your skin lightly and is not overpowering. I thought that I would try it because of all the wonderful reviews this fragrance has, but have realized that I personally like fruity types of perfumes rather than fresh. There isn&#x27;t anything wrong with the fragrance outside of this as I can see how it works really well with women that enjoy a light and fresh scent. It is definitely a \\&quot;clean\\&quot; scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  There IS something unique with this fragrance that I&#x27;ve noticed now that it&#x27;s warmer outside and I sweat more...it is actually a nice fragrance and smells so different from the way it has before. Perhaps this is what everyone that loves this fragrance is talking about in their reviews....I love it!</li>
    <li> I love PS Design. It is light yet noticeable, very soft scent.  The price is great for this size bottle.</li>
    <li> NOT THE ORIGINAL THIS MUST BE A GENERIC PRODUCT.  WILL NOT PURCHASE AGAIN.  AND I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A WONDERFUL PERFUME!!!!&lt;br /&gt;ANYONE WOULD LIKE THIS PRODUCT!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I REALLY ENJOY WEARING THIS WONDERFUL PERFUME!!!!&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU MUCH.</li>
    <li> Nice Gift! I love it...</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, and so happy to be able to buy online without the Macy promotions. Don&#x27;t need the cute dust collectors that they offer and the makeup etc... This perfume has a nice soft fragrance that I enjoy wearing and it makes me feel happy. I have used this perfume Design for years, not the same bottle ha ha...Wear it all the time.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s beautiful and wonderful condition. Person who received loves it. I highly recommend this facsinating and eye catching purchase to anyone.</li>
    <li> Perfume arrived when expected and was packaged well. Paul Sebastian Design is a beautiful scent. Very very happy with the purchase!</li>
    <li> This is a great buy! It smells absolutely wonderful. It is just the right size. It was just the right price too.</li>
    <li> I get lots of compliments on the  smell</li>
    <li> The fragrance is a almost non existent. It is just a bit above colored water. Years ago Design perfume products had a dynamic fragrance, that lasted almost all day. Now 10 minutes after I put it on, you can&#x27;t detect any was used. It is so sad to see such a wonderful product has degraded to such a low level..</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff and I love not having to break the bank to keep her happy!!!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! She loves this stuff so yeah..</li>
    <li> I saw the positive reviews and thought this would be a great gift for my aunt, but when it arrived, the ¨clean¨ smell described in other reviews smells more like Lysol and the scent made me nauseous.  I&#x27;m even more upset that it cannot be returned.</li>
    <li> Wife has worn this item for many years. This company provides a very good cost and deliverly to the customner. When you can buy two of these items for the cost you would pay at a local store.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite fragrance. I get compliments just about every day from strangers asking me what I am wearing because they love it! This has been discontinued, I believe&lt;br /&gt; :-(&lt;br /&gt;I always buy it now on Amazon- best price and very fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years. I always get compliments when I wear it. Always. People love it and so do I.</li>
    <li> I have been buying this perfume for twenty years finally found a place that has a great price</li>
    <li> Been wearing this perfume for about 17 years. Love it.</li>
    <li> Packages arrived FAST and intact. Love it!</li>
    <li> I thought this was the stuff I have been using for many years.  I used to get it at the large dept. stores but they quit carrying it.  I figured it went out of style.For quite a time now I have been ordering it from Amazon, from different suppliers. I know the price is a lot less than the $50. I used to pay but figured again it was because it is a passe fragrance.  All that I ordered seemed weaker than the dept. store stuff, but this last bottles I got do not even last 10 minutes on my skin.  Even spraying it on my clothing it cannot be smelled 30 min. later.  It seems like a scam that the packaging and bottle are identical as from years ago but I no longer get comments at the middle of the day(not even at the beginning shortly after applying it) as nobody can smell it. I will probably look for another fragrance at the dept. store as even at a good price this is a waste of my money. I got free shipping by buying two bottles so it is not worth it for me to pay to return it.  I have wasted enough money on this product.</li>
    <li> The cap on the bottle was not the original cap. It took three people to pry it off. I assured my mother that the product would be just as good as buying it at a store and I was wrong.</li>
    <li> design is my signature scent.  at amazon it is so much cheaper than in department stores it is to good to  pass up.</li>
    <li> Design is my All Time favorite perfume. I wear lots of fragrances including my favorites of Avon, I have been an Avon Rep. for 25 years, and whenever I wear Design, I ALWAYS get asked what scent I am wearing. I had been out of it for awhile and lo and behold, the first time I wore it after your prompt delivery, 3 people asked what I was wearing. I usually order it through Beauty Botique but I googled the name and came up with your best price of $18.00 and some cemts/ It arrived in due time and your service was tops.  Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;Carolle Wescoat</li>
    <li> My friend wears Design all the time!  It smells fantastic on her!!  I wish perfumes smelled the same on everyone!!  I&#x27;ll certainly buy this for her again on her next birthday!</li>
    <li> One of my mom&#x27;s favorite fragrances. I always keep some since she passed 10 years ago. Smells so good.</li>
    <li> I agree with the previous ratings. It doesn&#x27;t last as long as it used to. However, it still smells great!</li>
    <li> very happy with the cost and love design cologn.</li>
    <li> I love it! Great smell!</li>
    <li> Always terrified this will be discontinued. I always get compliments when I wear it and love it so much....It is the best.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume of all time.  I was so surprised at the price here at Amazon.  I will continue to purchase this perfume here and the seller was excellent as far as shipping.  Perfect transaction!</li>
    <li> Just what the wife wanted</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn Design for years...it&#x27;s the kind of scent that other women will stop and ask you about. ( Men too ! ) In a way, I hate to share a 5 star review... It&#x27;s kind of nice having it be MY secret.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this parfum. What more can I say? I will continue to buy this parfum as long as it is available.</li>
    <li> THIS IS MY FAVORITE FRAGRANCE. I HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR MANY YEARS. MANY PEOPLE HAVE ASKED ME WHAT I AM USING AND THEN BUY IT FOR THEMSELVES.</li>
    <li> I will like to send one to my sister in Puerto Rico</li>
    <li> My wife loves, loves Design.  The compliments she gets when she wears it are remarkable.  This bottle purchased through Amazon just didn&#x27;t smell the same as it does when you buy it from a major department store.  DISSAPPOINTED!!!</li>
    <li> This is my signature smell! Love it.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite fragrance since 1987...LOVE it...great price.</li>
    <li> Have used this scent for years.  Everyone always asks what fragrance saying &amp;#34;You smell great, what are you wearing?&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This is for my Mother and it got here super fast. Nice...</li>
    <li> This perfume used to be great and last all day, I think either this was a knock off or the company changed the formula with low price ingredients.</li>
    <li> The order was as advertised and the shipment was prompt and in good condition. I was very pleased!</li>
    <li> This was part of a Christmas gift for my sister.  &amp;#34;Design by Paul Sebastian&amp;#34; is my sisters signature perfume.  She loves it, and I&#x27;m pleased with the purchase and her reaction</li>
    <li> For me, Design is the best fragrance ever. I describe it as classy and elegant. I never thought of it as fresh, as so many others have described it. For me, it is pure class all the way. My absolute favorite of all time.</li>
    <li> i bought this pruduct because ive used it before and i love the way it smells so i desided to buy it from amazon the price was great but when i got it i new it was not the real thing it looks so cheap the box is fake and the botle is not even done wright i cant beleave they are selling this stuff do not buy it</li>
    <li> Too sweet for me.&lt;br /&gt;I went with the reviews online.&lt;br /&gt;But realized it is not my kind of smell&lt;br /&gt;Please don&#x27;t buy</li>
    <li> This is by far the best smelling cologne that I have ever smelled.  I wear it every day!  I LOVE it!</li>
    <li> Love it, Love it,Love it,Love it, I will for sure be ordering it again very very soon. Thanks Love it,</li>
    <li> This made it to my home in good time and well packaged. I wanted to find this perfume based on the fact that my mom wears it and I like it and wanted to get some for myself and her as well. It has a really wonderful scent that is not overwhelming. I thought this was a really good price for such a large bottle. You cannot find it for that in the local stores. It is very convenient to shop for perfume on Amazon, they have it all. Also nice to have it shipped to yourself or the person you want to send it too. I would recommend this to everyone, it has a scent that you could wear out, or to the workplace I feel. I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> Never heard of this perfume before I discovered it on here. Decided to buy it for my grandma based on its description. I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase. It smells nice like something she would wear. The product arrived a few days earlier than expected,  so that was a nice surprise, but the box and the lid of the bottle were slightly dirty.</li>
    <li> Gift was well received and arrived in good condition. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Gift for sister - her favorite cologne.</li>
    <li> This is my wife&#x27;s favorite perfume, and a bit hard to find locally.&lt;br /&gt;She was thrilled when I found it on line and at a reasonable price also.&lt;br /&gt;She is most happy with the purchase. When she&#x27;s happy, then I&#x27;m happy!</li>
    <li> bought this before, however i got this big bottle for less than 1/2 at a department store, luv luv the smell</li>
    <li> great price and got quickly</li>
    <li> I HAVE WORN DESIGN FOR 33 YEARS OR SO NOW.  LOVE IT. WOULDNT WEAR ANYTHING ELSE. HARDER TO FIND THESE DAYS, BUT GET MILLIONS OF COMPLIMENTS ON THE FRAGRANCE.  THANKS FOR MAKING IT AVAILABLE.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Design by Paul Sebatian for many years. I get at least one or more compliments a day when I&#x27;m out and about. It&#x27;s fresh aroma makes me feel springy. I recommend this highly</li>
    <li> My husband bought this for me years ago and this is all I wear any more. I have tried different colognes but they are always too powerful smelling. What I like is that I can&#x27;t smell it but everyone always tells me I smell good!</li>
    <li> I receive nothing but compliments when I wear Design.</li>
    <li> You have a hit women love it,don&#x27;t waste time get a bottle</li>
    <li> This fragrance is a special soothing and yet crisp not powdered sugar and vanilla only.  It&#x27;s a casual or formally wearing in all occasions. It worked well with my own chemicals balancing the fragrance with out altering me or the perfume. Try the miniature, it did well for me with fragrance, the seller packaging and shipping.</li>
    <li> product as described.</li>
    <li> I got this for my sister.  She just loves it.  It was new.  The cap was difficult to take off.  However, it&#x27;s off now and she&#x27;s very happy.  I would highly recommended this product for women, who like this fragrance.  My sister is middle age.</li>
    <li> too strong for me, i have seen this scent for years and went on customer reviews, not for me. gave away.</li>
    <li> For years I LOVED design,LOVED it!!  Recently I have returned 6 bottles.  The scent is NOT the same!  I bought a  bottle from TJMAXX, thinking someone tampered with Amazons bottles. The one from TJMAXX is also lousy.  What has&lt;br /&gt;happened to this wonderul parfum??  I looked and looked for some address to contact the company but cannot find&lt;br /&gt;anything.  Has anyone else had this problem?</li>
    <li> Unbelievable scent. I get stopped constantly by both male and females as to what I am wearing . Difficult to find in retail stores.This has the most beautiful aroma to it. Have been using it for 4 years now and always buy from amazon. Order it and it is here within a few days . Never ever hesitate about buying this perfume.</li>
    <li> Paul Sebastian developed a lovely scent in Design. My mother really likes it and I like that I can smell it on her and that she smells so devine. Stays on olive skin well. An older Parfum that is still worth getting.</li>
    <li> Love my Paul Sebastian perfume spray, will order again !!</li>
    <li> Love Design by PS!  It has a sweet smell and last all day!</li>
    <li> I have used DESIGN FOR YEARS.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is light and warm.people always ask me what I am wearing for fragrance.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Paul Sebastian&#x27;s &amp;#34;Design&amp;#34; for 25 years.  People still stop me, ask what I am wearing and tell me that I smell so good.  This is a great price too.</li>
    <li> smells better on someone else but i like the smell</li>
    <li> Design is, and has been, my wife&#x27;s sole perfume of choice for many, many years.  It&#x27;s not heavy, fruity, flowery, nor musty smelling, and has a pleasant enough whiff of its own from the bottle, but that&#x27;s just the beginning.  Its glory is that, like a true perfume, it integrates with the wearer&#x27;s body chemistry to create somewhat of a unique &#x27;aura&#x27; which surpasses its own aroma.  My wife has been asked repeatedly, over the years, as to what perfume she is wearing, by both women and men, and many have commented that they intended to try it for themselves or gift it to their wives.  It&#x27;s simply the best perfume around and she won&#x27;t be without it.  Finally, i&#x27;d like to add that its availability at Amazon is a godsend as the stores that traditionally offer fragrances seem follow the next big magazine ad campaign and change their offerings with the next breeze, leaving this amazing product somewhat hard to locate in our city.  Thank you, Amazon!</li>
    <li> Want to smell like you just stepped out of the shower? Try this product.  To ensure that fragrance is not too strong, I spray it up in the air, then walk underneath of it.  I love it.</li>
    <li> My favorite for years.</li>
    <li> I have worn Design since the mid eighties and always have people ask me what I wear.  The price point is great as is the fragrance.</li>
    <li> Mom&#x27;s favorite. Price is about half of price in stores.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Paul Sebastian&#x27;s DESIGN for years. This is not the same.Fragrance doesn&#x27;t last..don&#x27;t waste your money. Get the real thing at the Department stores.Terrible to use the product bottle only to find it cheap and watered down.</li>
    <li> My wife perfume , she loves it so I bought it for her , If you want to please your wife buy it</li>
    <li> I have used this perfume for over 30 years. I love it. Get lots of compliments when wearing this.</li>
    <li> Oldie but goodies - very happy to find on Amazon.  Thank you :)</li>
    <li> I bought this as a present for my wife and she is very pleased with this perfume.  I think it has become her favorite.</li>
    <li> Exactly as pictured. Bought as a Christmas gift. Good value.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite perfume and I always receive compliments on it.  I know they&#x27;re more expensive perfumes out there  but for whatever reason this sent works well with my body chemistry.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted at a bargain price!</li>
    <li> Have worn this for over 30 yrs, eeeeeek, can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s been 30 yrs, but it&#x27;s true. I still get the same wonderful compliments on this beautiful fragrance today that I did back then. I am constantly asked what fragrance I am wearing and where to find it.&lt;br /&gt;I love the fresh, clean scent it has. Haven&#x27;t found anything I like better, so far!</li>
    <li> My wife loved it...her favorite....life time customers with you all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> I ordered this bottle because I love the Design scent, this bottle has almost no scent at all. I guess I will try to purchase it from a different source. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> We purchased this fragrance for a gift. This perfume is a long-standing favorite with a light, floral, pleasant tone.  This size seems to be suitable for daily use, lastIng about 8 months.</li>
    <li> big savings on one 0f favorites</li>
    <li> Received in two days. Excellent price</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite perfume and it&#x27;s the only kind I&#x27;ll wear!!!!!</li>
    <li> This was purchased as a gift for a friend.  She had great difficulty locating same.  I was thrilled to find it for a reasonable price, &amp; she just loves it!</li>
