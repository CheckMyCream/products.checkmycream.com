<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very excited about this product! I have a list of ways I&#x27;m using it from homemade deodorant to lip balm! No longer wasting money on fancy lotions. Shea butter and essential oils are the way to go to know what you are putting in your body.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use on my hair. I love it. I will repurchase.</li>
    <li> Love it. Use it on my homemade cosmetic and by itself. Great product, great quality.</li>
    <li> Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!!!!! I had recently tried aloe in my face due to my break out ( normally have nice clear skin) however the aloe dried my skin and made the rash or whatever I was experience worse. I ordered this product and it soothed my itchy dry skin, since I have bn using it no more itchy face and the rash is almost totally gone. I&#x27;m using it everywhere. Fyi my sister stole some from me lol and my friend asked where I got such a rich Shea so far three people are thrilled with this product.</li>
    <li> UPDATE: June 2015&lt;br /&gt;I am updating this product as of June 2015. My hands are healing with this. My nails and cuticles are growing due to the protection. Use at night and morning. A little goes a long way so use sparingly.  I love this so much and use daily. This is for men as well. Guys, A little goes a long way. Soften your hands elbows feet, body. Lovely, light fragrance, not too much. A must have for skin care for men and women.&lt;br /&gt;I no longer keep in the fridge. The AC will keep it from melting in container. Grab half teaspoon full, put in palm and rub, it will melt enough to apply this way. My new fave, even though I will use other hand lotions throughout the day. I will purchase again, however, this size will last and last. Lovely texture, smell, product and results. Hope this helps you, this comes from someone who loves gardening and going barefoot, so I need help! This does the trick. I am hoping in Winter my hands will not crack at the fingernail! Good luck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hi, well this is impressive. Yes is is solid, it will, like coconut, melt with the heat of your hands. I live in a really hot climate and keep it in the fridge until I am ready to use it. I do scoop it out with a silver spoon, that will forever belong to this jar so as not to contaminate the contents. I do this for my coconut oil as well.&lt;br /&gt;It is a lovely product, creamy, smells divine, and yes I would and will be re-ordering it again. It is a large size, and will last a very long time. Your skin softens up right away. I love to garden and my hands show it. This is perfect, it &amp;#34;calms&amp;#34; down my hurt, rough, like sandpaper, hands. I use it nightly and during the day as well. I do not find it greasy at all once it sinks into the skin. I am very picky about creams. Love organic food and all things natural. Love this brand. A good choice. I have gone broke trying to find the right mix and products for my skin sometimes, and I believe I have finally found something that will heal, soothe and keep it that way.y.</li>
    <li> This is so wonderful, it melts right into your skin and absorbs in. I rub it in my hands and rub it on my face , it is great on your lips, hands , face, neck etc..Give it a few minutes after applying  for it to absorb. Love love it</li>
    <li> Very hard. Does not go on smoothly.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and great authentic item.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I used it to make my own whipped body butter using it, coconut oil, and jojoba. Plan to buy again!</li>
    <li> It has taken me a while to post a review because I wanted to be sure about what I am saying. I love this product. There is absolutely no signs of any contamination or alteration. It is waxier than a previous product I purchased (but I suspect it was not pure shea). It absorbs beautifully leaving the skin soft and smooth. I use it for a whipped body butter that I sell on my site.&lt;br /&gt;It has a mild smell but not unpleasant and it is ivory in color.&lt;br /&gt;The company has been in touch with me regularly since my purchase and while I have not needed customer service I am convinced they would be extremely cooperative if an issue arose.</li>
    <li> I used this on my very dry skin 5 days ago. I think once a week will be enough to keep my skin feeling good. It has a crumbly consistency when applying but gets oily pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> This is the best!!! So happy that I recommended to several friends that already bought it and they are so happy like me! 😊</li>
    <li> Really great quality. I&#x27;ll be ordering again. It&#x27;s the real thing.</li>
    <li> bought to use in home made lotions. dont care to much for the smell but you get use to it. works well. will buy again</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer, and I like it that I can use it on body, face and hair, cutting down on toxins.</li>
    <li> This is a repeat order, This is the best raw shea butter I&#x27;ve ever used, it doesn&#x27;t smell funky, it&#x27;s so nice and creamy, it&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ll use in my body butter product. It leaves your skin feeling like pure silk.  I&#x27;m using this along with the organic beeswax I bought from Amazon to make a body butter to give as gifts for a baby shower.  I also purchased the little jars from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I ordered this weeks before I needed it and wanted to wait to write a review until I used it. Using it raw and in my face cream it leaves my skin feeling really soft! My face cream recipe I used left a recently popped zit looking better and I can tell it will help certainly heal better...and today is just day one!!! I plan on also using this in my hair conditioner. I will definitely recommend this to anyone and I will definitely reorder when I run out!!!</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter for her skin problem and it really helped her.</li>
    <li> Perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Right color, right mild scent. I use this in a body butter and in a creamy face wash. I needed something a bit more moisturizing than my coconut oil.&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was perfect, I love that it&#x27;s organic and they seem to care if you are pleased with their product, I did get some emails from the maker with idea for use, and checking to see if I was happy with my product. I like that. Easy to opt out of emails also. Will be buying again soon!</li>
    <li> Great product!  It melts easily in the palm of your hand and is easy to apply. Skin soaks it in quickly so there is no greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> The only moisturizer that I has helped my daughters extremely dry skin. The smell isn&#x27;t the best but the product works.</li>
    <li> I have really dry hands with eczema and this Shea butter is the only thing that completely moisturizes without irritating them. I highly recommend this product for anyone who has chronically dry and sensitive skin. That said- it is really thick and so it takes awhile to absorb. If this kind of thing bothers you more than living with dry and/ or itchy skin, Shea butter might not be for you.</li>
    <li> This is my first purchase of a jar of raw shea butter from any merchant. I&#x27;ve used it for several days, and the Perfect Body Harmony Raw Shea Butter seems fully satisfactory.</li>
    <li> I use this along with cocoa butter, almond oil, and coconut oil to make whipped body butter. It makes my skin very supple. Great stuff</li>
    <li> Clean white product. Nice size jar. Smooth.</li>
    <li> No rough skin or signs of cracks on my fingertips after a week of use.Hands are much smoother and younger looking.Massaged into my feet and heels last night and woke up to much smoother feet.Suggest you wear a pair of socks to bed as it is greasy.The product expires 6 months from date of purchase but I dont know how long it sat in a warehouse.Low humidity refrigeration will ensure shelf life.I will never use all of this product in 6 months.I am going to research how and what to mix it with to make a lotion.It is too greasy to use alone and doesnt absorb quickly.Overall seems very good for your skin.</li>
    <li> The packaging was as expected and I received a speedy delivery. I love this product. It&#x27;s makes for a great base for DIY moisturizer products.</li>
    <li> This is a high-quality product.</li>
    <li> Very good  product. I haven&#x27;t used it that much yet, but the texture is very true. I use Shea Butter to make my body mixture</li>
    <li> This is the best Shea Butter I have purchased. I am very happy with my purchase and will order this product again and again. The company is extremely helpful.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize it was cold pressed which I wanted it wipped my fault I should of read into it more, so far so good my only downfall is the scent smells nasty!</li>
    <li> Clogged my pores big time.</li>
    <li> My skin feels softer not dry anymore</li>
    <li> it was surprising to see that this shea butter was so hard but once it is in your hand and warmed a bit it is really nice.  it will take 10 yers to use it all.</li>
    <li> Just love this product. Came on time as promised. Nice packaging. High quality product.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS STUFF... MY SKIN IS SO SOFT</li>
    <li> Granted this was my first purchase of shea butter, but I was not prepared for the smell. Its not terrible, but I have a sensitive nose &amp; its strong. Like a musky, nutty, smoky smell that is NOT able to be covered up by fragrances from essential oils. I did some research and it seems to be normal, but I had read it lasts for a year, while the jar said only 6 months. I hope its not already rancid and that&#x27;s where the smell is coming from because the feel of it is great, smooth &amp; moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I find this shea smells very subtle and nutty, much to my relief after reading some the negative reviews.  It came in a UV protected jar and it is warm enough where I am that I am finding it perfectly easy to apply without extra steps.  My skin adores it, I find it absorbs wonderfully and doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling oily.  I&#x27;ve started adding zinc to it for sunblock and it&#x27;s done wonderfully with my very fair skin.  Very pleased with my purchase and will certainly purchase again.</li>
    <li> Second time ordering this we love it. So many uses, hydrates but not greasy!  A little goes a LONG way, we will order again.</li>
    <li> So far I like the shea butter. It leaves my skin feeling very nice. After a few minutes of applying it, if you do not put too much on at a time, it drys up and does not feel greasy but very nice! I had to try a couple of times to figure out the right amount to use, did not take long. It has a light smell but  after a while I don&#x27;t notice the smell. I am happy with it so far and i am very picky with my bath and body products. It is organic big plus!! I like the big size and can make some of my own skincare with it.</li>
    <li> Came quickly, good stuff!</li>
    <li> Now, I&#x27;ve bought beauty supply store shea butter that said they were &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; shea butter. Bs! this is real shea butter. It&#x27;s very like creamy but solid if that makes sense ,not hard like beauty supply store shea butter and it smells light. Which I love. I hate overpowering smells. It&#x27;s  just smooth and goes on easy on my body I love it! The jar is huge and it was deliver rather quickly. I put it on my hair and my skin and my face at night. Absolutely No regrets.</li>
    <li> Nice butter. Creamy. I used 4 butters and an oil to make whipped butter. Wonderful.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff works great</li>
    <li> Make my skin super soft, slightly oily, but great product. Has a light cocoa butter scent/natural scent, but no perfume scent like the faux shea butters found in other products that advertise themselves as shea butter. A little goes a long way and one container has lasted me 6 months, with daily use. I will order this again.</li>
    <li> High quality product from a high quality company. I&#x27;ve bought their cocoa butter as well. I used it in my body butter..came out fantabulous!</li>
    <li> I made my first magnesium body butter with this product and it came out great. My family is happy to use the finished product. I did not find issues with it being malodorous. It smells like what shea butter is supposed to smell. It comes in a wonderful container which I can recycle. I just purchased a container similar to this for $11.00! I am talking about just the container......no shea butter in it. I will purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> Best for the Grandson!</li>
    <li> I wanted to share my review, my order came in 4 days ago. Usually during the winter I get severe dryness on my legs and so I always have to moisturize and even apply antibiotic treatment, I know it sounds horrible but this is why I&#x27;m sharing. My legs are finally starting to heal! I seriously have used the Shea butter 4 times and I&#x27;m already seeing results! I love it!</li>
    <li> This was an amazing deal! The amount product received for the price paid continues to amaze me. The quality of the product was definitely high quality. My family uses this shea for everything from hair twisting to moisturizing our skin. I would definitely recommend this product for your family.</li>
    <li> Great Shea Butter, very smooth and creamy!</li>
    <li> Good for my skin. Light enough to apply on in anytime of day or night.</li>
    <li> Product is so good. I have always been a Shea butter advocate and this product truly works wonders for my skin. It&#x27;s also great on hair too!</li>
    <li> The lid of the product was cracked when I received it and the top of product a little dry otherwise it is good and I would possibly purchase again.</li>
    <li> Best Shea Butter I have bought. Very silky smooth and makes skin so soft! Will definitely buy this again!</li>
    <li> One of the best products I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> So far so good! Worked wonders on my feet which spend 40 to 50 hours hours a week in steel toe shoes. The perfect body harmony people sent me a couple follow up emails to make sure I was satisfied which was very nice. The butter  absorbs pretty well and I have been basically using it on my whole body since I got it...even deep conditioned my hair! It seals in moisture and seems to heal dry skin. I feel like it has evened out my skin tone and improved some of my stretch marks as well and ive only been using it a week give or take...but I do also do skin brushing as well as some bentonite clay detox so im sure this trio is helping my success.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Does not rub off that easy like other brands and really make your feel good !</li>
    <li> I needed this for my daughter who suffers from eczema. I have tried many types of shea butters but none have worked well. I will be purchasing this shea butter again.  Update on Product: I am SUPER pleased with the quality of this shea butter. My daughter&#x27;s skin looks 90% better!! I blended this shea butter with 4 other oils....I can&#x27;t believe the difference in her skin! I did a lot of research because her doctor offered no real solution and I did not want to continue to use toxic hydrocortizone on her skin.  If you or your loved one has a problem with eczema, this will help. Use along with a good quality lotion. Just a side note: I used a quality lotion alone, no results. I used the 4 oils alone-no results. I used the oils + lotion together-this was a bit better but still not really working. Adding the shea butter made the difference.</li>
    <li> This is a Godsend!! A friend of mine and I was talking about dry skin. And mine is extremely sensitive. So most lotions/moisturizers  only last for a short period of time. My friend told me about this and I instantly used my Amazon credit. I&#x27;m a former Chef so by default I have extremely dry hands. They have kept my hands soft and pliable all day. The true test is when I took a nap (in the nude) and I didn&#x27;t have to re-moisturize myself. Even my my feet!! I posted it on FaceBook and gave thanks to my friend. I told them to buy at Amazon because it only has one product: Shea Butter</li>
    <li> Love the product.....Shipping was quick and packaged well. The jar it is in is plastic... I wish that it had been a glass one (my personal preference) I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Seems organic to me! Perfect for my lotions and creams.</li>
    <li> wonderful product. very pure with slight natural scent. will order gain.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this time the shea butter shipped is not as smooth and easily spreadable as the previous shipment! The butter is rough and hard to apply on the skin! Hope this was just an isolated case as my wife and I were really happy with the previous shipment!</li>
    <li> It smells horribly but works perfectly. It leaves my hands buttery and silky smooth. It does smell really bad though.</li>
    <li> Truly perfect. It is hard because it is raw and all natural, so I will be making a whipped shea butter from this. The jar is huge and for the price that is awesome!</li>
    <li> works and feels great</li>
    <li> Great product! I use it for anti-aging on my face, neck, and hands.  This pure shea butter works great and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I would have preferred something a lot softer.  For those considering this purchase, this is fairly hard at 72 degrees.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to try this product, read tons of reviews and did a lot of research on different brands. But I&#x27;m disappointed with the smell, it&#x27;s awful. I know what shea butter smells like, a little nutty. Mine smells like the plastic jar :( it does not smell natural or organic (as claimed) at all....very bummed. I even mixed it with coconut oil, didn&#x27;t help. Wondering if I got a bad batch??? Otherwise seems to moisturize well, hasn&#x27;t helped my eczema though. Should I contact someone about the smell???</li>
    <li> Few companies go to the lengths that this company does in terms of ensuring customer satisfaction.  I had a minor issue with the texture of my Shea butter (it was a little gritty) and Perfect Body Harmony went to great lengths to get me not only another jar, but they sent an larger version than the one I originally bought.  The Shea butter itself is &#x27;to die for&#x27;.  Add to that the world&#x27;s fastest, kindest, and most honorable customer service and ... what can I say?  I&#x27;m an eager fan 😃</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product.  I used it to make my body butter and it turned out terrific!  I would purchase this product again!</li>
    <li> Great quality. Excellent product and service.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best shea butter I&#x27;ve ever used. The texture is wonderful easy to apply. I make my own products but I&#x27;ve just been using this on my skin and I really love it.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Use it daily on myself and my kids. Will order more to make my own lotion bars.</li>
    <li> Absolutely wonderful product, very rich, creamy fresh shea butter exactly as described by seller. And I couldn&#x27;t believe I received it the day after I ordered it!  I&#x27;m not in New York City where they have that drone thing going on, or about to go on, so......how did they do that??????  I love shea butter, it&#x27;s a staple for my family&#x27;s self care, these folks will be my source from now on.</li>
    <li> This product is an all around wonderful creation! It has helped with my dry skin and hair, it does come a bit gritty so I like to melt it down a bit in a bowl over boiling water. Then it becomes an oil-like consistency that is easier to rub in. Wow! I&#x27;ve been using it for about one month now and am very pleased by the results. It actually is healing some of my breakouts. The smell is not the most endearing but I find that if mixed with another scent like rosemary or vanilla, it doesn&#x27;t bother me. Love this shea butter!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a lighter of some scars I have still haven&#x27;t seen results but It dose help with dry skin.</li>
    <li> Great product, very hydrating, easy to scoop, has a very faint smell but you don&#x27;t pick it up in the final product. I made lipbalm, deodorant and face cream with multiple combinations so far and it came out great.</li>
    <li> I have read mixed reviews about Shea Butter clogging and not clogging pores but I had to see for myself.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is combination (oily and dry):&lt;br /&gt;1. My cheeks stay moisturized&lt;br /&gt;2. Risky but I used it on my forehead (which is oily) as it helped with my breakouts (hard to believe).&lt;br /&gt;3. Keeps my body moisturized, skin feeling smooth, never clogged my pores, and no breakouts of any sort.&lt;br /&gt;4. Apply at night before bed or on light in the morning since Shea Butter will leave an oily residue on your skin but in do time your skin will absorb.&lt;br /&gt;5. Using Shea Butter eliminates my face lotions, and oils that I was currently using. (Save money $$$$)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you have the courage to try Shea Butter</li>
    <li> Definitely have to warm it up a bit first - but BOY does it work miracles in the winter.  My skin does not dry out again for 48 hours !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE it</li>
    <li> When I got pregnant for the first time, I was terrified of getting stretch marks! I then got in contact with a African woman who made her own natural raw cocoa and Shea butter. She mixed them with other oils and sold them for a living and told me it would help me with preventing and maybe even reducing the amount of stretch marks from pregnancy. I thought hey, doesn&#x27;t hurt to try. I had researched a lot of stuff about stretch marks and I was always disappointed at the fact that there is nothing to actually guarantee u won&#x27;t get them. Anyhow, I rubbed this butter mix on my body for 9-10 months until baby was born, every single area of my body where the butter was rubbed, I had no stretch marks. The areas where I didn&#x27;t rub All that much (butt) I got small stretch marks which eventually faded after a while. I used that butter mix religiously for 10 months  and I remember the smell, the feel of it and what raw natural Shea and cocoa butter is suppose to feel like... This Shea butter is even BETTER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had no stretch marks and I had gained over 80 lbs of baby when I got pregnant. After I lost the baby weight and then got big again (stress) I started to get stretch marks in the areas where I never had them before. And mind you I was NOT using this stuff at that time. That is the reason why I am going back to this stuff, clearly when I was using it I never got stretch marks, as soon as I got as big as I was during pregnancy, all of a sudden I got stretch marks... Doesn&#x27;t make sense unless the Shea butter and cocoa butter actually worked in preventing it.&lt;br /&gt;My family genetics aren&#x27;t good either because all women in my family have stretch marks. The only one that never got stretch marks during pregnancy was me, and the only reason I believe that Is, is because of the cocoa and Shea butter I was using daily. I just wanted to point that out since I know some my be thinking that it was just genetics that I didn&#x27;t get stretch marks... Well I&#x27;m telling u, that couldn&#x27;t be farther from the truth lol</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this butter. It has cleared up the acne on my face within days!!</li>
    <li> wonderful product great customer service thank you</li>
    <li> Great product and it is easy to apply.</li>
    <li> This is honestly the best Shea butter I have tried.  The texture and smell is a much better quality than any other I have tried.  I will continue to purchase this brand.</li>
    <li> Really great product. Love the texture. Feels wonderful on the skin. Would definitely recommend. You get a lot for the price.</li>
    <li> Lovely high quality product, great value-thanks!</li>
    <li> I am so happy with my Raw Shea Butter. I saw on another review that they whipped this product with some organic Coconut Oil(I only mixed 1/4 cup of the Coconut Oil with the Raw Shea Butter and it all softened up really nice while mixing with my Kitchen Aide Mixer), so that&#x27;s exactly what I did and I absolutely love it! I use it on me and my daughters a lot especially after bath time. The Next morning our skin feels so soft and replenished. My youngest daughter has super dry skin and I cou tell a huge difference in her skin after just one use of my mixture. The smell takes a little time to get used to if you&#x27;re not accustomed to it But overall I ab love the Raw Shea Butter and will be ordering it again.</li>
    <li> very pleased with this product. I also ordered a jar for family member.</li>
    <li> Product quality is excellent .  Company support and suggestions exceeded expectations.</li>
    <li> The product was better than expected. This was the first time I had used Shea Butter so it took a little getting used to, but now I love it. It is so moisturizing that the water beads off my legs in the shower. It is fantastic for chapped lips too. I just finished making my own sunscreen and Shea Butter was one of the ingredients so I am sure it will help in repelling some of the water when I swim. Love the product.</li>
    <li> Great product!  It took me a little while to get used to because it is thicker and it needs to melt in your hands, like their instructions say, but it feels really good going on and i love that i&#x27;m not putting all that other junk chemical fillers on my body&#x27;s largest organ.</li>
    <li> Great shea butter... I had bought another brand that was a bit gritty, and didn&#x27;t know better.</li>
    <li> good product and fast shipping</li>
    <li> Very nice quality shea butter.  I don&#x27;t even have to mix it with anything if I don&#x27;t want to.  Shea butter is very firm and some of the butters I&#x27;ve purchased in the past were so hard that I couldn&#x27;t really use them without mixing them with another oil -- the seeds apparently vary depending on region.  This butter is firm, but quite usable as is.  Some might want to add essential oils for a particular scent, but I&#x27;m happy using it right out of the jar.  I read some reviews mentioning the smell.  All plants have a scent.  It&#x27;s pretty mild and is fine for me.</li>
    <li> Perfect for making body butter.</li>
    <li> This is really a lovely shea butter.  It&#x27;s hard to find certified organic shea butter in smaller quantities, and I needed it for a product I make.  Very glad I trusted the reviews for this and I can add my very high praise to the list.  The texture is right, the smell is fresh and very slightly nutty, color is soft ivory.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful. It shipped quickly,  was a high quality Shea butter and the customer service was great.</li>
    <li> Awesome!  My hunt for the perfect moisturizer is over!</li>
    <li> This shea butter is pure and my family loves it on our skin! I will be ordering more in the future, thank you</li>
    <li> I bought this to use for making body butters and possibly soaps.  I just made my first batch of body butter and I am very pleased with the results.  This shea butter is very smooth.  Although I was surprised with how hard it is, but I have never dealt with raw shea butter to know it&#x27;s usually pretty hard.&lt;br /&gt;Side note, I also ordered cocoa butter, and I didn&#x27;t know that smelled so strongly if cocoa (ie like super dark unsweetened chocolate), I feel like an idiot saying that. I didn&#x27;t realize that these &amp;#34;butters&amp;#34; were as hard as they are, ie not very &amp;#34;buttery&amp;#34; until you melt and whip them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shea butter melted very nicely and I am very happy with the body butter I was able to make with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad to have had such a great experience my first time purchasing shea butter!  Quality product!&lt;br /&gt;__________________________________&lt;br /&gt;Sold by:  The Perfect Body Harmony Store&lt;br /&gt;Shipped by: Amazon&lt;br /&gt;Delivered: 5 days after order date</li>
    <li> Great product! Company sent follow up instructions on how to use.</li>
    <li> Smells good and very creamy.</li>
    <li> Order arrived very quick, am very pleased with Perfect Body Harmony and staff..will be ordering again once I run out</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!  I&#x27;ve used it on its own, in lip balms, creams etc.  Love love love it!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love it so much.  Try it you will not be sorry</li>
    <li> I buy this every couple months. I mix this with a variety of essential oil, and it made such a difference in my hands! Love this very much!!!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and perfect for my needs--thank you.</li>
    <li> This shea butter is so soft and smooth. I brought this for my son&#x27;s skin and he loves it! Says he looks like a shiny penny when he puts it on. Will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Excellent shea butter.  Smooth, easy to apply, plentiful.  A very good choice for me.</li>
    <li> Very happy, quality product.</li>
    <li> Very rich and moisturizing, but agree with many other comments that the smell is unbearable.</li>
    <li> Like this shea butter.  I don&#x27;t always realize how dry my skin is until I moisturize it.  This product is rich and I have used it alone with no problems.  I do plan to make some lotion bars with it just for ease of application.</li>
    <li> Love how creamy it is. Works beautifully with EO recipies.</li>
    <li> I got a spider bite after receiving this. It was painful so I put Shea Butter on it and it helped the pain a lot. It is for my Great Granddaughter who has very rough skin and hope she uses it faithfully.</li>
    <li> good quality and price</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. Excellent moisturizer. I used to use coconut oil on my body until a friend introduced me to shea butter. The coconut oil would absorb and about half way through the day my legs would be dry. However, with the shea butter they are hydrated all day and feel really soft. I have a mild case of  eczema and certain things cause it to flare up. The coconut oil helped a little, but the shea butter actually healed the patches and I have had no more problems. I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;PS.  I store this in the refrigerator to get more longevity out of it. There is an expiration date.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I&#x27;m using it to make skin cream. My skin is singing YEEEEEES!</li>
    <li> This Shea butter is not smooth to the touch. Probably due to the raw nature. But once I take a small amount on my hand and it begins to melt and smooths effortlessly over skin surface. It nourishes deep in my skin, even bottoms of my feet.would suggest to a friend.</li>
    <li> Excellent, fragrance free moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I love the quality of this shea butter and the amount they give you for the price. Definitely will continue buying my shea butter from Perfect Body Harmony.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the very finest Shea Butter I have ever used.  Very creamy, pure and lovely.</li>
    <li> For the price, this is absolutely the best! I have extremely dry skin on my body, and this works very well to moisturize.  Sometimes when my skin is super dry I melt some butter in the palms of my hands and mix it with a bit of Evan Healy hydrosol, and it does wonders for the skin.  No more dryness!</li>
    <li> I received my order today, and the texture of this Shea butter is terrible.  It&#x27;s like grits.  And it doesn&#x27;t mix or rub in at all. It sits on my skin and looks like grits. I&#x27;ve ordered and used raw Shea butter before, so I understand that you need to run it in your hands to melt it a little before applying. But this stuff is terrible. Will be returning.</li>
    <li> This product was as described and perfect. Quality! I am glad I bought it and I use it a lot.</li>
    <li> I made body butter with my shea butter and am well pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer ever!!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Will never go back to another product!</li>
    <li> Great product! Works great. The whole family uses this product. I especially like to use this on my children because it doesn&#x27;t contain all the chemicals you find in most lotions or creams.</li>
    <li> I made a face cream ... it worked great to mix with coconut oil and essential oils!</li>
    <li> Hey This stuff is pretty good . I burned myself pretty bad  touching the bottom of a glass  pan accidently while I was heating up some queso . I added some Lavender essential oil to this Shea Butter and applied it to my fingers and it never even blistered!! AWESOME healing power! I am going to use this to make Homemade Organic face moisturizer and also  Homemade Organic Antiperspirant/Deodorant. I will repost further opinions  after I have  the results of my products!</li>
    <li> Love it! Everything it promises!</li>
    <li> Will definitely be ordering this again and again.  Made my own lotion with this (4 parts Shea Butter, 1 part Unrefined Organic Coconut Oil) and used a mixer to blend it all together.  Add your favorite essential oils for fragrance.  Very creamy lotion.  Storing in a 4 oz glass mason jar.  Even my kids are using it every day.  Has made a world of difference for our skin.</li>
    <li> 10 out of 10 quality! Excellent seller</li>
    <li> I been using this product for a little over a week and I absolutely love it!  I bought it to use in my daughter&#x27;s hair.  This product hydrates her hair so well.  I also tried other uses that were suggested.  I use it as  a moisturizer on my on pregnant tummy (stops the itch), skin moisturizer and sunscreen.  I was having trouble with pregnancy acne and now my face is clearing up nicely.&lt;br /&gt;I will agree with some other reviews that the product can be crumbly, however it melts like chocolate on a hot sunny day in your hands.  The crumbly texture seems to have lessen since I been using the product.  Give the product a try, you just may like it!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome!I buy a lot of shea from different places this is the best I&#x27;ve found,I especially  love the jar . I have also ordered cocoa butter from this seller and again awesome product.</li>
    <li> I use this as a night cream on my face ( it doesn&#x27;t cause acne, it actually helps heal any that has developed during the day), and I get a lot of compliments on my skin. I also have been using it on my baby as an after-bath moisturizer for the last few months because he has sensitive skin. He kept getting a full-body, mild eczema-type rash with different baby lotions, so I tried this raw shea butter and it cleared up the rash in a couple of days. I now also use Shea Moisture Baby Wash and lotion, and those work great. This shea butter has a very mild scent, kind of like cooking oil (don&#x27;t eat it!). I&#x27;ve noticed other shea butters, specifically ones that don&#x27;t come in light-blocking containers, smell horrible, like cigarette ashes or something. I highly recommend this shea butter. It is hard to get out of the jar, especially if you keep it in the fridge like me, but I just scrape it out with a butter knife and keep smaller portions in an airtight container for the bathroom. If you want to make your own soap or lotion with it, get the bar. It comes in the UV bag and you can just cut off what you need.</li>
    <li> Giving this five stars because the company seems very caring and knowledgeable and the butter itself does a GREAT job.  This stuff actually makes my body feel like it retains its natural moisture for once.  I have really really dry skin and usually after applying lotion my skin still feels dry (from the inside out).  This Shea butter not only adds moisture to my skin but seems to create a barrier KEEPING it there for quite awhile.  I usually apply it after a shower or before bed or when I know I am not really going out.  The scent is not terribly unpleasant, but is definitely strong enough that others might notice it and your skin does look somewhat shiny after applying.  I think this is a great product to alternate with your regular lotion and it lasts forever!</li>
    <li> The Shea butter smelled rancid when I opened it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this product one bit.  It&#x27;s way too hard in the container to begin with.  I don&#x27;t want to take the time to rub in my palms first to warm it up before applying.  I want to be able to apply it right away.  Also, the product makes you feel sticky after applying.  I don&#x27;t like feeling sticky.</li>
    <li> lovely stuff.  lightly scented. and you put a little bit between your hands to soften and rub it on your dry areas.....whether it is legs/ hands/arms/ face..  first time buyer for this product. but have already recommended to several friends... lovely stuff to keep skin soft/supple in the winter........... takes a few minutes to soak in, but doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel to your skin...........</li>
    <li> i was excited to get an organic face moisturizer, but was definitely not aware of how it would come out.  Maybe it was my ignorance on the product, but the product comes in almost a solid form, then when smoothed in hands it becomes a very thick oil, and goes on the skin as if you were spreading coconut oil on…the though of using pure organic shea butter sounds better than it is…the oil gets on everything that you sit on after.  I do not recommend before bed because it will get all over your sheets...</li>
    <li> My first time buying Shea Butter and I am enjoying finding ways to use it. I thought it would be a little oily for skin, but it doesn&#x27;t take long and my skin absorbs it, which based on the quality of this and that fact that its organic is a good thing. I&#x27;m really glad I bought this and its easy to see that it just could become something that I need to keep available at all times.</li>
    <li> Wonderful quality and packaging. Arrived in timely and good order and love the product!!</li>
    <li> Do not like this product. I have used other shea butters which left my skiing soft and hydrated. After applying this brand I have to use lotion after. I will be gifting it to a friend to see if it works for them.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST shea butter I have ever used!!  It is very smooth(not grainy like the others) ,  creamy and smells good.  The others I&#x27;ve used were trash compared to this one. I use it in my hair, face and body. The pricing is very good for the excellent quality of this product.  I&#x27;m going to try their coco butter next.</li>
    <li> I am using it to make my own body butter.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Very nice....My skin thanks you!</li>
    <li> I have never used a Shea Butter before, but I love this one for mixing with coconut oil and essential oils to make skin care creams and one to apply to the big toe and bottom of feet to help wih sleep. I want to add it mixed so easy with the coconut oil and the mixs came out so nice and feel wonderful.</li>
    <li> Great for hair and skin and arrived fresh, not rancid smelling like some of the other shea butter I&#x27;ve purchased in the past that came in clear bags.</li>
    <li> I warm it up in the microwave before I shower...works perfectly ....and the container stays in the fridge...organic raw Shea butter is the only moisturizer I will use.</li>
    <li> Love it! Great product.</li>
    <li> When it&#x27;s soft its great. Unfortunately it&#x27;s hard 99.9% of the time.  This makes the butter extremely hard to apply.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing shea butter. I had problem in my nails ; getting broken quickly. But after using this shea butter now I have good strong nails.&lt;br /&gt;thank u</li>
    <li> I happy to say that i&#x27;m very pleased with this product. It melts quickly in the palm of your hand, from your body heat. A small amount goes a long way, and it absorbs quickly. The scent is suttle, it leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
    <li> Pretty hard to take out and has an unpleasant smell. If i would have known coconut oil has the same uses and is available locally i wouldnt have bought it.</li>
    <li> I used it to make my own body butter and it worked fantastic  And knowing that it is all natural makes it even better</li>
    <li> The product has transformed my hands, feet, and décolletage. It works and is not too harsh for my sensitive skin like other products. It is supposed to have Vitamin A,C,E, and D all of which is great for the health of your skin. I have Celiac disease with dermatitis herpetiformis a blistering skin condition. It has helped soothe the rash and faded the resultant pigment changes. The rash flared recently due to exposure to gluten. I am sold! My husband told me to buy more because he can see the changes. Wonderful product for me!</li>
    <li> Great product, thanks so much.</li>
    <li> This is such a great product.  It is hard to make into a liquid or cream, as I want to use it for my skin.  I mixed with my coconut oil and although it still gets really firm, it is workable.  My Shea butter is also a little gritty.  Love the results.</li>
    <li> Great product!  I have been using nightly and my skin feels wonderful in the morning.  I also took some along on a trip to Mexico and used it after I got burnt.  I never did peel.  Will order again.</li>
    <li> I just love the Organic Raw Shea Butter! It is so rich and creamy. My skin is dry and this is a great Organic, natural and healthy way to put nutrients back into my body</li>
    <li> Wonder product! Just as advertised!! Melts down smooth and creamy. There is NO gritty feeling whether it&#x27;s solid or melted. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> Love this product and the seller!!</li>
    <li> saves the day!!!!!!!!  the packaging is great and sturdy.  the jar has a seal and when you open it, you can smell and feel a great product.  this really does the job on dry flyaway hair, itchy skin, chronic dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i love love raw shea butter. it&#x27;s is like duct tape ;)  it will fix everything.</li>
    <li> UPDATED REVIEW 10/6/2015  So after my attempt to find another shea butter after the inconsistent product (being grainy) with my last two orders, perfect harmony shea butter was seriously like the boyfriend I could not get over. Other shea butters couldn&#x27;t compare and I knew I had to go back. I was scared that the shea butter was going to be grainy so I decided to contact the customer service I spoke directly with one of the owners. He was super friendly and explained to me that due to the hot weather where the product was being produced, the shea butter became hard, hence causing the grainy textures. He said that there should be NO MORE bad batches and the quality should be back to normal. I ordered another batch and I WAS IN LOVE AGAIN is not more!  So if you were like me and got a bad batch, please go back and give perfect harmony another try! I promise you, you won&#x27;t be disappointed. If you are debating if this brand is the one for you, look no further. I&#x27;ve tried them all - THIS IS THE BEST SHEA BUTTER you can get!   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- There is no disputing the multiuse and benefits of Shea butter, but quality and consistency is what differentiate the various brands. The first time I purchased this shea butter, is was smooth, super silky and literally the perfect harmony. I used this shea butter religiously in place of lotion and it&#x27;s been wonderful- The best shea butter I have ever purchased! Come to my second order, it was grainy and did not melt has it claims it should. It felt like an exfoliant. Which is obviously scratchy when apply and AWFUL for eczema. I might have a bad batch. Returning it and going to give it another try for redemption and will update my review.  Third order. This time it wasn&#x27;t as grainy, but still grainy. If you try to rub it into your skin you are left with little sandy pebbles (see photo of my arm) everywhere and it&#x27;s too hard to rub out and will leave a huge messy on your floor.  I really wish I could get the same texture as the first batch i received. Oh perfect harmony, you are sadly not so perfect anymore. I would have given you 5 stars for that first batch but since the last two batches were grainy, you get a 1 star for inconsistency. I tried.  **also know that the product states you must used within 6 months of when you order the product.  Photos are of my received product all in July 2015.</li>
    <li> An amazing moisturizer for hands, face, etc., great in your hair for volume and pliability, and a good lubricant. A great deal and a great product.</li>
    <li> Had a good experience using your product. I will purchase this in the future.</li>
    <li> great product fast shipping</li>
    <li> Not as great as my first order(this one crumbs up a lot....however it get the job done</li>
    <li> This Shea butter really softens my hair and helps with my natural hair style. Natural beauties...buy it. You will not be disappointed</li>
    <li> I had a problem with my first order, but Jana worked with me until we got it right. Could not ask for better customer service. This company really cares about their customers. I use this shea butter with coconut oil for a face cream and also with other products in a natural all-purpose salve. So many uses for Shea Butter. I love it!</li>
    <li> The Organic Shea Butter is really good.  I tried many moisturizers earlier and still facing the dryness.  After using this Butter for few days, the dryness is reduced to a large extent.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff!  I had used another brand of Shea Butter in the past (like many people, I make my own body butter, lotions, etc).  It was ok but I didn&#x27;t think much of it and often times would exclude it from the recipe.  I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the smell.  I thought I&#x27;d try a different brand to see if it would make a difference.  It really does.  This new brand has a much better texture and the smell is WAY better.  It reminds me of a cross between that typical shea butter scent and cocoa butter.  I was pleasantly surprised.  So now I&#x27;m using it right out of the jar because I can&#x27;t seem to get enough of it.  It makes my skin feel really silky.  Nice on the lips too (haven&#x27;t had time to make my lip balm).  I&#x27;ve also been putting it on my hair before bed (not a ton) and it&#x27;s really having a nice effect on my dry, frizz prone hair.  I would definitely recommend trying this!  Quick ship too.</li>
    <li> Raw shea butter is very hard. I scrape it out with my nails. It softens when I rub it on. It keeps my skin soft.</li>
    <li> Great product! Came as described! Highly recommend this seller!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Lovely product but I don&#x27;t know how to get rid of the white small chunks that stick on the skin</li>
    <li> Really nice product!  Been using immediately after shower when skin is still damp...  Works well!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> On time delivery. Smells great and you can make so many thing with it</li>
    <li> Everything I need it to be!  It works perfectly in the recipe for my new favorite facial moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Excellent Shea Butter.</li>
    <li> very pleased with the butter and the pakageing</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s excellent, it is good for your body and hair.</li>
    <li> SInce this is the first time I have purchased or used Raw Shea Butter I have nothing to compare it to.  I have made my own moisturizer adding Coconut Oil, and various essential oils and I do like it so far.  Will need to melt the shea butter next time to get rid of the lumps but other than that so far so good.</li>
    <li> This shea butter is very smooth and creamy. I&#x27;ll be ordering this product from now on.</li>
    <li> Great value and service!</li>
    <li> Very nice shea butter! Was hoping this would be the real deal, and upon opening it, it had an amazing fresh scent that went perfectly on my skin.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. The shea butter is pure and works wonders for my skin. It has faded out my stretch marks and scars. Anyone who purchases this will not be disappointed. Note to perspective buyers: This shea butter works but it takes time.  Be patient but you will definitely see results. I had an accident with scalding water about 3 weeks ago and started using this immediately on the burns. My skin healed faster and the scars are lighter than they would normally be without me using this shea butter.  I will continue to use this product as long as the company exists.</li>
    <li> This is the best thing out of all the things that I have tried for stretch marks to calm them own and less irritated therefore less pink or red&lt;br /&gt;It also works excellent when you were a dress or skirt and have no shorts to wear applying some to your inner thigh will prevent chafing</li>
    <li> Seem to be a good buy, will update later</li>
    <li> The quality seems good enough, but the seal broke in shipping and by the time I got it, about 1/5 of the shea butter had spilled out into the box. I live in Arizona and it is June, so that could definitely have been a factor in the integrity of the seal.</li>
    <li> This product is exactly what I hoped it would be. I am using if for making my own body lotion, it&#x27;s a great value as well! Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. I have ultra sensitive skin ( eczema ) and this is relieving.&lt;br /&gt;Customer service is exceptional far up and above.</li>
    <li> When I recieved my first order it was very gritty. I tried taking a hairdryer to it to see if that would help enough to us  it. I didnt have any luck with it. I contacted CS and recieved a response within minutes. They sent me out another jar the next day. I recieved it. I was scared to open it in fear of a repeat...well I was shocked!!!! It is very smooth and creamy. This it melted with my skin. I use  it as a night moisturizer. My hubby made a comment about how my skin is starting to glow and I dont look tired. My skin is so soft and my skin tone is evening out.  I will most definitely be buying this again. Customer Service did a great job to make me one happy satisfied lady.</li>
    <li> Great product! Recommended!</li>
    <li> Excellent Product. As a guy I don&#x27;t care for most skin products. I use this on my shaved head and neckline. I use it on my hands. I also use it on my freshly shaved gentials (Sorry for being so honest but hey it works). No issues and My skin is baby soft. No ingrown hairs, rash, or discomfort.</li>
    <li> Shea butter is the best thing I have found for dry skin.  However, it is very expensive when bought as moisturizer and usually it is only partially Shea Butter.  Certified Organics Shea Butter is exceptional!  It is clean, no debris, and has a mild but pleasant scent.  At first I used it as it came.  I had a chunk chunk that I rubbed over my skin.  That worked quite well but I would have to rub any pieces that broke off into my skin.  I wanted to make it softer but not watery.  I ordered a bottle of unscented sesame oil to mix with the Shae butter.  By experimentation I found that 4 parts of Shae Butter, heated in my microwave so it was a liquid, mixed with one part of Almond Oil gave a firm cream when it cooled.</li>
    <li> This is the best shea butter I&#x27;m ever used.  feels great</li>
    <li> ididnt work for me ihave got alort of break outs ists bad for oily people</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Authentic Shea. Great value.</li>
    <li> My sister and I both keep this Shea butter stocked in our home. We use it for the whole family. Good quality Shea butter!!</li>
    <li> I love it!  However, this is my first time buying shea butter, and I did not realize how little I would need!  So I have been sharing with my friends!</li>
    <li> Awesome shea butter. I use it on my skin and hair.  I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my terribly dry feet and skin after a long winter.  At first I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to use the hard lump of shea butter but the internet suggested warming a small piece in my hand and that did the trick!  Really works on my poor feet!  Not as simple as softer lotion but definitely effective.</li>
    <li> works great, nice ingredients</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  My husband has psoriasis and it has helped the skin to become normal colored and smoother.  It is hard to apply at first, then it warms up and spreads easily.  In no time, the product has penetrated the skin leaving no stickiness or oil that can be transferred to another surface. We both use this product and love it.</li>
    <li> I used it during my pregnancy and thanks to this my skin was smooth and no stretch marks appeared. I am still using it because the jar has a pretty good quantity. I just use the warmth of my hands to melt it and I then directly apply it. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> this has a nice smooth texture, i wonder if anything is mixed in with it? like, is it really 100% pure shea butter or is there cocoa butter in it? i only ask because i have never experienced such a nicely-textured shea butter as this. usually, organic unrefined shea butter is grainy and sticky and doesn&#x27;t absorb easily. but this stuff absorbs easily into your skin almost like cocoa butter@! i&#x27;m hoping it isn&#x27;t mixed with cocoa butter. so far i give it 3 stars because i haven&#x27;t put it on my face yet. i plan to make a sunscreen out of this for my face, and i will update then. i will be mixing this with almond oil and zinc oxide to make my sunscreen.</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizing product I have ever used.  Initially, after reading reviews, I was concerned about graininess.  I have not found this to be the case at all.  Like butter, it instantly liquefies in your hands after rubbing them together.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price! Wonderfully smooth Shea butter that has saved my dry skin this winter.</li>
    <li> Used this with some coconut oil to make some homemade lotion. Loved it!</li>
    <li> This the real sha butter.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent, I will be ordering more very soon as I use this shea butter constantly on face and body. The extra best part is the customer service which is truly exceptionally good.</li>
    <li> I am giving this 3 stars because of the smell. It really smells rancid to me, not a nutty or smoky smell like others have described. I even tried to mix lavender oil with it but can&#x27;t cover it up. It does make my skin feel great though. If anyone has suggestions on how I can cover the smell, please let me know because I want to use this on my face.</li>
    <li> Love it! Best Shea butter ever and I&#x27;ve tried quiet a few! Makes my 4b hair soft. Makes my skin soft. It&#x27;s so smooth and unbelievably gentle on the skin. I just love it.</li>
    <li> I love the product! It is creamier and easier to use than any Shea Butter product I have purchased before. Not as hard nor is it yellow like many Shea Butter products.  The jar is wonderful because it protects the Shea Butter from sunlight, the twist on/off lid goes on/off easily and remains on securely.</li>
    <li> too hard to spread Tried putting in sun to soften but did not help</li>
    <li> This shea butter was not creamy like the first one I ordered, this one was so grainy and gritty, was very disappointed.  When I put it in my hair it looks like sand.</li>
    <li> It came in the time frame it was supposed to come and it is a good product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used another shea butter  before  but this is much better. It is smooth, light in color and texture and is easily absorbed. I must say its not gritty at all. It is value for money and will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt; I use it at night on  hands,lips,knees,elbows  and feet. Shea butter is a natural  and  effective treatment for my dry skin  and I see a big improvement in the condition of my scars.&lt;br /&gt; I love it  and  will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> After just one week of using this organic shea butter, my skin is much improved in it&#x27;s appearance.  A little goes a very long way!</li>
    <li> Love the Shea Butter, prefect texture and ease of use</li>
    <li> OK so I love it! It is indeed natural shea butter. And my skin is softer after 1 use. Apply after a shower and enjoy the benefits</li>
    <li> Best Shea Butter I have used...great quality.</li>
    <li> Just got the product. I bought this to make my own body butter for the first time. I have not had time yet but I have used the product as it came. It is wonderful. It has a light nutty fragrance and has no grit. While researching my first purchase many reviews said something about strong odors and gritty feel for other Shea products. This is exactly what I was hoping for. Packaging was in great condition and very useful. I will buy it again</li>
    <li> Awesojme---NOT GREASY!!! sinks right into your skin!!!</li>
    <li> Great product for soaps and lotions</li>
    <li> I love it!. I use this product for my body and to make soap. It is a really good moisturizer to use on the face as well. I recommend it, and will surely repurchase this brand.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never purchased shea butter in this form before so was not entirely sure what to expect. The butter is very thick so a little goes a long way. I did see significant moisturizing however, this product came to me very grainy. The top layer of the butter almost smelled rancid. I&#x27;m not sure if I will oder this brand again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been very pleased with the quality of this shea butter, and I like that it&#x27;s in a tub instead of a bar.  It&#x27;s not perfect.  It&#x27;s my first time using shea butter, and I have found that it definitely takes a LONG time to dry completely.</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used on my skin. Truly moisturizes!! I mix it with a few drops of lavender oil and rub it between my hands to warm it up. It takes a little while to fully rub in, but I see it as an opportunity for a quick self-massage. Love this product.</li>
    <li> Super fresh. Works best when your body is a little damp from the shower because it soaks into your skin. Melts in your hands literally.</li>
    <li> I like the product very much.</li>
    <li> ok, I do not think this is raw. It is hard as a brick! I had to cut a chunk out with a sharp knife and melt it, adding just as much mango butter as shea butter and it was still very hard and didnt want to melt!&lt;br /&gt;So i melted the mix again and added 2 table spoons of Now Sulutions glycerine vegetable and about 40 drops of almond oil. Its still hard but it will melt in your hand now with about 1 full minute of rubbing your hands.&lt;br /&gt;It also was very white and organic raw shea butter should have a creamy color and be very soft.&lt;br /&gt;My guess, it is refined and older than my grandmother.</li>
    <li> Long-lasting, therapeutic moisturizer. Great after showers or before bed. It hasn&#x27;t felt greasy on my skin (though I understand that some may have that experience), and a little goes a very long way.</li>
    <li> luv it, nice product, looking forward to future purchases.</li>
    <li> This is a VERY GOOD product &amp; I highly recommend it.  Great price, smooth &amp; creamy shea butter.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is that it has a slight smell that isn&#x27;t something I would choose.  I have an extremely sensitive nose &amp; the smell disappears quickly, so it is probable that most people wouldn&#x27;t notice it.  When the jar is empty, I will reorder!</li>
    <li> Great packaging and great product!  I use this Shea to make my body butters, it turns out wonderfully!</li>
    <li> I whip it with some coconut oil and it goes on smooth. Use it for overnight cream.</li>
    <li> Shea butter helps my daughter&#x27;s chronic eczema very quickly. Applying it one to three times a day makes her marks fade, a much preferred skin process to the topical steroid ointment recommended by her doctor for her extremely tender skin. The fact that it has vitamin E and hydrates her while ridding her of eczema without chemicals from lotions makes for a very happy mama. The only reason I give it four stars is because the second batch I got was incredibly grainy. I could still use it, but it is a pain to rub it over and over again between my palms before breaking down and dissolving it. Also, sometimes it does not dissolve when I rub it in my palms, and my daughter has what looks like lint all over her skin! But, since it is still an effective and natural treatment for her skin woes, I still love it!&lt;br /&gt;p.s. I love the fact that it is in a dark bottle to protect its properties from becoming rancid or depleted</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the costumer service of Perfect Body Harmony.&lt;br /&gt;This is a good product to make your own body creams and hair conditioner. It is also good for the face (if u have dry skin).</li>
    <li> Excellent. Over just a week, dry spots on my body are smoother and less flaky. Especially helpful after a mild sunburn.</li>
    <li> My wife loves the shea butter. She said she uses it on her hair, skin and nails. Not a day goes by that she doesn&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> Love this! Used it throughout my pregnancy and it&#x27;s great to keep my skin moisturized! This doesn&#x27;t have as strong a scent as some other Shea butters so I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering this one from now on! My young kids also love to put some on their skin from time to time and I use it for so many things.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a lover of shea butter and I find this product a plus for me, as my skin is very dry and the shea butter helps a lot to soften and releive&lt;br /&gt;the dryness, this butter is compacted and pure, that I use a small spatula to carve out from the jar, then rub into palm of hand to soften the&lt;br /&gt;butter, because it is a Raw butter, but effect. This product arrived on time and exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I read some reviews before purchasing a shea butter product. From what I understand, there are a lot of poor quality shea butters or not &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; shea butters that are out there that are billed as being &amp;#34;pure.&amp;#34;  I got this product and fell in love immediately. Again, I am sooo glad I read some reviews!  It seems I hit the jackpot on the first go. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll try another brand because I am very happy with this brand and this company.  It is true (as I read in some of the reviews) you do need to soften the shea butter in your hands first, but that is not a problem for me.  You can really feel the quality of this shea butter when you spread it on your skin. I&#x27;ve even used it on my face and have had no breakouts or other problems.  Some reviewers mentioned they used it on their face; I admit I was dubious because I can be prone to breakouts, but I haven&#x27;t had that issue with this product.  Another good thing: it doesn&#x27;t take much, so it looks like this jar will last me a while. I definitely recommend this product and will be purchasing it again in the future.</li>
    <li> love it its perfect with my oils.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find any information on this company which is a little strange.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit of a chore to use but I think it is effective for softening skin.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s nothing appealing about the scent though - whoever said it smells like diesel fuel was right on.&lt;br /&gt;That smell goes away after an hour or so though.  Best application is before bedtime.  You don&#x27;t want this on your clothes.</li>
    <li> I am absolutely in love with this Shea Butter!  I&#x27;m new to experimenting with making my own whipped body butters and this product is working great!  I would recommend this to anyone wanting to make their own organic body lotions. I will be a return customer. Actually I have already sent for my second jar!  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Not good! Never gets to a smooth consistency . Hard to smooth in, I would not get this again. It was a waste of my money. The Nourish Organic is much better.  A refund is in order, never again😔😔😔😔 Disappointed. This was the worse mess ever! No good consistency, like sand rubbing on, crumbled never soft and broke apart!</li>
    <li> I have had eczema on my ankle and sole of my right foot for more than 3 years and I&#x27;ve tried many different products with varying degrees of success. After a period of time these products no longer worked and the eczema would get worse. It&#x27;s only been since I started using the Perfect Body Harmony Shea Butter that I believe this may be what finally clears up this skin condition. I&#x27;ve seen a 90% improvement over a period of just a few weeks and this is more than I&#x27;ve ever experienced with any product before. So I&#x27;m optimistic that I&#x27;ll finally be rid of it and that continued use of this product will head off any further outbreaks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m extremely disappointed with this Shea Butter. I should&#x27;ve paid attention to the negative reviewers. I took a leap of faith based on the mostly positive reviews and now I regret it. This product is grainy, sandy. I thought the grainy texture would go away once melted, but it doesn&#x27;t. It left my skin as if I had sand particles on my face.  Update: Just received a replacement Jar, and it seems they made sure the quality was great this time. This new jar, instead of grainy, is like as if it were mashed potatoes, which is good. I just think that to those who are having big problems with the product, like someone who has her face scratched, they should give them a replacement and a refund too. I&#x27;m giving them 4 stars, in a week or so, if the product keeps its consistency, I&#x27;ll up it up to 5 stars. I think it&#x27;s only fair.</li>
    <li> My skin LOVES this Shea butter. Excellent quality, and smooth texture.</li>
    <li> Looked a long time to find the real Shea butter and this is it! Great quality stuff. Another product to use that doesn&#x27;t have para bins and other harmful chemicals</li>
    <li> Very spreadable and absorbs quickly. It has a slight Odor that disappears after a few minutes.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair soft and manageable.Not oily on skin or hair.&lt;br /&gt;Needs a little rubbing between fingers before applying.</li>
    <li> This is now my primary skin care product - for my face and body (and has been for  the last few years).  This Shea Butter is buttery firm, but I add Vitamin E, Rosehip Oil and Sunflower Oil to it.  There are an endless list of essential oils one could list - depending on what one&#x27;s needs are ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t actually mix it altogether, but simply add the additional ingredients to this jar on top of the shea butter.  It works and my skin looks and feel great; plus I feel good that my skin care is non-toxic, effective and far cheaper than commercially available &amp;#34;anti-wrinkle creams&amp;#34; ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sib</li>
    <li> This Shea Butter is absolutely wonderful. It is not super hard like some other raw butters will be, but will obviously vary due to temperature. Being a Vegan &amp; environmentalist, this product makes me very happy. It has not harmed any beings &amp; is an organic, sustainable product. Also, you are putting beneficial things into your skin, rather than chemicals. They also have put it in an amber container to protect the product from UV rays. Absolutely wonderful. And to make everything even more magical, this company PERSONALLY emailed me to educate me on the wonders of this product. Perfect, perfect, perfect! I support this company 100% &amp; am very curious about their other products. Thank you Perfect Body Harmony!</li>
    <li> love the product. this is a reorder after my daughter got hers and found SO MANY uses...any skin condition on man or beast responds well to this product</li>
    <li> This is the best buy ive ever done for my hair and body. It really does fix damage hair and almost instantly fads fine lines under the eyes and ive only been using it at night ! So awsome : D</li>
    <li> I loved the jar but it was not sealed properly and living in AZ the climate is very hot and it melted and seeped through to the box it was shipped in. A bit of a mess. Lid hard to unscrew. Great thing about the butter is it will return to its solid form.</li>
    <li> With this product I dont need preshave,shaving soap,aftershave or moisturizes.I just put this on my face and shave,no razor burn and you can see where you shave because it is clear.I use an old fashion double edge razor and can make 3 or 4 passes without adding any extra shea butter.Great product and a money saver if you use it like I do for shaving.</li>
    <li> Great quality.  Use as my night cream.  It has to melt with body heat so take your time when you apply.  It has a natural smell, almost smokey.  That goes away. A little goes a long way.  I bought and used several years ago while in Africa.  I was so glad to find a source to easily order the real stuff. I put in smaller jars and share with family. I will store in my refrigerator.</li>
    <li> I is the best shea butter that I have used so far, and my husband agrees. I will use this one from now one because it is not as grainy feeling as some of the others and it is easier to apply.</li>
    <li> Good product, give it a try :)</li>
    <li> Shea butter really well on my eczema, but has an oily smell (should have expected that).  My daughter has found ways of mixing it will other ingredients for things like lip balm, and sweet smelling lotions.  Good price for the size.</li>
    <li> I love love love it! It feels and smells so great and is such excellent moisturizer for my skin after I exfoliate! I week be a loyal customer!</li>
    <li> I searched until I found a premium certified organic raw shea butter -- and am so very pleased with this product! My purchase came in the jar, which is more convenient for me. The consistency, color, and odor are as advertised. The product maintains consistency very well at 79-80 degrees. I use the butter mostly at night as a moisturizer and have been very pleased with the results. It does not have a strong odor, and does not clog my pores. It is an absolute wonder as a foot moisturizer, too!  I simply put a small amount in the palm of my hand and rub my hands together to liquefy the butter (takes a few seconds) - and apply.&lt;br /&gt;This is the best shea butter product I have found, and am happy with the quality of the product. I highly recommend this certified organic raw shea butter!</li>
    <li> The delivery time was great. However, it is extremely grainy and  hard to apply it under room temp  of 87 degrees. I was really excited to actually use it based on the reviews!</li>
    <li> This product is very high quality.  I liked the container.  This product met and exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love the shea butter!</li>
    <li> recommended by acupuncturist - like product</li>
    <li> This leaves your skin silky. I made body butter with this and Cocoa Butter , both from the same seller.  This is so worth the price.</li>
    <li> Great product- got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> I had to come back and write a review for this Shea Butter because it is one of the best multi-purpose products I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve never purchased shea butter previously, and looking for it here on Amazon turned out to be quite the chore considering all the bad reviews most of the other ones got. But I lucked out by making this one my first purchase of shea butter!  Having said that, I can&#x27;t compare it to other shea butters, but I feel like this is heaven in a jar. It&#x27;s an off-white color and has a mild nutty smell to it, one that I like. The texture is fluffy yet buttery, and somewhat crumbles to the touch. When rubbed down it melts into a smooth, creamy texture that is amazing at supplying and locking in moisture. I have very dry hair and dry skin, (very dry face) so I mix it with pure unrefined coconut oil (equal parts) for my hair and body. I find that mixing it for my hair is most important because when applied to the hair pure, it becomes too stiff and hard to work with. (mixing also helps by saving $) But using it unmixed on my face and feet works wonders! I even use it on my lips and under my eyes. It leaves my skin so supple and smooth I&#x27;m amazed really.   I just hope this helps someone save time, because I seached for days before I chose this one. And was dreading the wait for fear that it may end up being a mistake or hassel. (Because searching for beauty products on Amazon is not always a great experience as most of you may know.) But this ones the real deal! When I need to puchase more, I will be purchasing it from right here. (Shipping was fast too.)</li>
    <li> Very satisfied.  Arrived quickly.  I used it for my homemade lip balm recipe, and it worked great.  Definitely would purchase this product again!</li>
    <li> Much better than any lotion I have ever used with no added chemicals. I will definitely be purchasing more of this in the future.</li>
    <li> I like this product a great deal.  It has done well in the different body butters, lip balms, and other beauty products that I have been creating.  The company is great to work with.  They email tips and are available to assist you if you have ANY questions.</li>
    <li> It arrived in great condition.. its perfectly clean ivory Shea butter I really love it great product will buy it again .also it works great for lotions and lip alms..thank you</li>
    <li> Great Shea butter.  Nice consistency, nice odor.  Will purchase from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Great deal and this stuff is excellent. Will purchase again</li>
    <li> My next door bought this product and love it so much and wanted me to try it on my husband who just had knee replacement a month ago.  She bought me a small sample to try. I loved it instantely. Went to Amazon and purchased and we both have been using it after showering. leave my skin soft and very smooth. Our skin was very dry after this long winter this product is truly amazing.  I have also noticed the scar on his knee is starting to fade. I will definately recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Cleanest Shea butter I have found. Melting point is just above body temp so you gotta rub it in, but it creates a nice buttered body.</li>
    <li> Great stuff!  So smooth and makes my whole body and hair feel great!  Has cleared up issues that store bought products have not.  I have used this alone but mostly I mix it with other ingredients to make exactly what I want!</li>
    <li> Thick consistency but absolutely wonderful. Takes a while to dry off but my skin is so smooth after. Defiantly worth the price for how much you are getting. I love using organic all naturally products.</li>
    <li> Smells horrible. Had to give it away.</li>
    <li> Have only been using for a few weeks but so far am very pleased.  I just use in it&#x27;s natural state.  Keeps my skin very moist.  Arrived in great condition.</li>
    <li> Amazing oil made my skin so smooth .</li>
    <li> Nice. Takes a Lil to melt down but smooth as BABY&#x27;S but skin after use</li>
    <li> CREAMY. SMOOTH, compared to other organic, unrefined Shea butter. I have been using Shea butter for about 8 years on my face and body. I just rub it between my palms and soften it. If it&#x27;s too heavy on my face, I just take a steamy face cloth and wipe off the excess. My facial skin feels great all day and not dry as the day goes on as with other face preparations. Being as your skin is the largest organ Angie this brand is so soft and smooth ill be using this on the body too especially in winter.  To save time sometimes I mix it with a little Alfa Keri to help smooth it in legs and body.</li>
    <li> Love this shea butter - I&#x27;m so excited about it this being organic and raw. I had fun making my own lavender whipped shea butter by mixing this in my mixer for like 20 minutes with some lavender essential oils. I am so happy with the versatility of this too - use raw as is or make fun other products! YAY!</li>
    <li> Grainy and a little difficult to work with as an out of the jar moisturizer.  I looked up recipes to try ( I wish some were included), but have not invested the time and purchased the additional ingredients to make a whipped moisturizer that sounds heavenly!  I question whether or not this product was once heated to pour into the jar and that process caused the graininess?</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It&#x27;s the 1st and only raw shea butter I&#x27;ve bought but I love it. I did some research before buying this and read reviews.</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing product!  My daughter has suffered from eczema for quite some time now and using this REALLY organic Shea Butter along with a few other changes in her diet we have seen a drastic change in her skin. Great Shea Butter I&#x27;ll be purchasing another jar today!</li>
    <li> This is a high quality product! Purchased for an all around go-to cream for various uses throughout our home. Have a child with severe skin sensitivity and found this to be one of the few solutions. Outstanding product and service!</li>
    <li> OMG, that is exactly what i need.</li>
    <li> This product is a miracle worker! I rarely write reviews, but I am very happy with my purchase.  I have extremely dry skin.  I live in Arizona.  I put this on after my shower and my skin relaxes, doesn&#x27;t flake, itch and the previous scars I made from scratching are fading away. Yeah! It is greasy so I put a towel under me on the couch, but it is so worth it! I don&#x27;t need to apply as much now to get a great result and my skin texture is improving.  I will be purchasing this from now on.</li>
    <li> I have purchased three different brands of raw, organic shea butter &amp; THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST!  Wish I had purchased this all along &amp; not wasted my time on the &amp;#34;bulk bags&amp;#34;, one of which was, indeed, moldy.  Great texture, you can tell it is fresh &amp; hasn&#x27;t been sitting a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Super smooth &amp; nice!</li>
    <li> We have tried almost everything in terms of lotions and creams. Our daughter has had mild to severe eczema since she was 4 months old and she is almost 3 now. We have used this product for about 2 weeks now and it has been amazing. Maybe it doesn&#x27;t work for you like it has with us so far, but we are so happy with the results we are seeing right now. It has been easy to put on and her skin has been so good lately.</li>
    <li> This is the best Shea butter I have ever used and the value for price is more than I expected.  It leaves my hair soft and locks in much needed moisture.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a couple of weeks since I started using this product and it has been working as I expected.  I&#x27;ve used shea butter from a number of companies but this brand leaves my skin feeling smooth and silky but not that &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; feel like some others I&#x27;ve used.  Good product, highly suggest you give it a try.</li>
    <li> This is the shea that works wonders on my body to treat eczema. I use raw, organic (truly natural)products for my personal skin care (MY SKIN, MY OPINION) . This shea, from this seller is top shelf. This isn&#x27;t the shea that can be found in urban hair care stores. This is better, this is clean, this is a great product.</li>
    <li> Its great for those few days in the winter if your skin is ultra dry and you don&#x27;t mind the natural smell of shea butter and having a &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; feeling to your skin all day, but would not recommend for warmer weather or on date night :&#x27;)</li>
    <li> Not my first time buying it from this company .simply love it.i make a lotion for my body with this butter.i like it in this container better,seem like last much longer</li>
    <li> This is best stuff I&#x27;ve ever put on my body! Feels like heaven butter! I&#x27;m planing on using it on my baby when it&#x27;s born!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product and indeed leaves my skin very soft and smooth. Great for deep moisturizing feet and hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customer service is incredible and thorough.</li>
    <li> I reordered this shea butter after being very happy with my 1st purchase. The second shipment came opened, leaking &amp; with a weird gooey/slimy texture. I just threw it out in disgust. I wrote a packaging complaint to Amazon to alert them to the issue, &amp; to my surprise I received a new container the following week with an apologetic hand written note from Perfect Body Harmony customer service. The replacement container contained the great product I remembered. I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> Smells good ... Melts like butter.</li>
    <li> Did not work for me.Caused irriatation in my skin and made condition worse. May be works well for others</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had acne and dry skin for a long time and this has helped SO MUCH it also lasts forever so it&#x27;s a great deal. I am prescribed an acne cream that dries out my skin and this product is perfect to balance it and keep it moisturized</li>
    <li> very happy with this product!!</li>
    <li> Great stuff, the smell is not as bad as some of the other ones I&#x27;ve tried and it&#x27;s effective in getting rid of larger wrinkles. Shea butter is a bit greasy but soaks into the skin after about 10 minutes.  This one has a very nice texture.</li>
    <li> I am completely satisfied with this product. This product arrived on time and in good condition, I would also recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a good grade of raw organic Shea butter. After I applied this product to my skin, I there was a noticeable difference in the moisture and texture of my skin. I am satisfied with this product and will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Read a lot of articles on shea butter and found this shea butter was perfect.  Love the product came in a jar.  Perfect Body Harmony handled and shipped quickly and I received it within days.  Thanks so much.  I am really enjoying it.</li>
    <li> My first jar was very grainy and I returned it .This company is great with customer service as they sent a complimentary jar,so I could try it! It is a great product at a very good value. Big jar!,</li>
    <li> This is now my &amp;#34;everything cream.&amp;#34;  Great for neck, face, lips, hands, hair.  Wonderful, clean smell.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product. The jar is perfect for scooping out butter for my solid lotion bars. I found the texture to be slightly different in the jar vs. bag, granted BOTH are silky smooth once warmed. I was surprised by the quality of the product and completely blown away by the level of customer service. I will continue to buy my butter here. THANK YOU!!!</li>
    <li> Love this item! Was worried at first but wow I was blown away.</li>
    <li> I love organic shea butter and this is nothing short of amazing. Very stiff at first but once you get to warming it up in your hands it spreads on like a charm. Moisturizing with shea butter for dry skin is what I recommend. I have not only been using this on myself but on my children also. One of which has extremely dry skin and eczema. It heals her skin wonderfully. Not only that I can&#x27;t say enough good things about Perfect Body Harmony shipping was fast and hassle free. I highly recommend this product from this company. You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I finally found raw Shea Butter that lives up to the hype.  I have tried different Shea Butter products and I judge the product based on condition of my skin and hair the next day.  This one is the real deal and I would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several different brands of shea butter. While not my favorite, it&#x27;s good quality and the company is very thorough.</li>
    <li> This is a second brand of shea butter that I ordered on amazon. I must say, it is very, very, very creamy and soft when being applied. Also, it is very light in color, almost white. Another brand that I am still using  is a bit different in texture and color. Not sure why. But I absolutely love the luxurious texture of the butter of this brand. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Outstanding product and company. Love the customer service. They have a customer for life.</li>
    <li> Great stuff!! Heals my dry, cracked skin during the cold, winter, mid-west months!</li>
    <li> Keeps my skin moist without feeling really greasy</li>
    <li> I am pleased with this product although it doesn&#x27;t smell very nice. I understand its a virgin product so I guess this is what raw virgin Shea smells like. It moisturizes my dry/rough nurse hands though!</li>
    <li> WOW, my son and I have very sensitive skin, no lotions, petroleum jelly, or cocoa butter did nothing to prevent our constant dry skin. Well we used Shea Butter for the first time, and I could feel my skin thanking me. Our skin quickly absorbed the Shea without  any greasy after affects. And I could swear that my skin tone took on a healthy glow. I swear by this Shea. But my wife tells me that she can get it at the beauty supply store for  much cheaper or even the African supply store. So, we have a bet that she can&#x27;t get this quality found on Amazon.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a high-grade Shea butter, your search is over. Excellent product!</li>
    <li> Good product.  Feels nice and very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Great product! Cannot live in my dry climate without it!</li>
    <li> best butter in the business</li>
    <li> Very thick. I found some ideas online for how to make a whipped version of this but i have not had the time to do it yet. If you ever had cocoa butter, the texture is similar, but i found this to be thicker. My skin feels sticky afterwards, so i think I will try to whip it up to make the texture lighter.</li>
    <li> Potent stuff. Know how to use.</li>
    <li> This raw shea butter is a great value for the price purchased. It is of good quality as other brands, a bit grainy but easily dissolves when rubbed. I use especially on my ankles which tends to be dry and it keeps it moisturized. This is my first purchase from this company will see how well it works when I finish the jar!</li>
    <li> This was maybe a defective batch, but it was full of really hard granules that would not dissolve with any heat. It hurt and scratched mine and my little toddler&#x27;s skin!</li>
    <li> I liked it!! It works amazing</li>
    <li> Best Shea butter I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Great. Just what I needed - DD&#x27;s skin has been glowing since I started mixing this with her body cream!</li>
    <li> im a huge fan of shea butter, there&#x27;s so many things you can do with it.personally, I love the fact that it&#x27;s non comedogenic but still incredibly moisturizing and its packed with vitamins and antioxidants that aid in healing scarred or damaged skin and I assume must be good for anti aging. it&#x27;s not grainy, it melts down and re hardens beautifully, all around high quality product. I&#x27;ve been using only this on my, in some places pretty badly scarred, body hands and face with a few other things I add to it  (aloe, jojobaoil, vitamin E, essential oils, etc) depending on where i am using it for the past 4 months or so and have seen much better results than anyyyy over the counter product i have tried (including all scar creams). i order from perfect body harmony and will continue to order from them!</li>
    <li> Great product!!! Love it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t write many reviews but I feel the need to tell everyone how great this has been for us. I developed pimples on my chin due to hormones (that&#x27;s what I was told by a skin specialist) and within a week this helped eliminate them and make my skin glow! I used it on my 3 year old&#x27;s chapped skin that just wouldn&#x27;t seem to heal with any other lotion and it cured it after 2 applications! I&#x27;ve been using it for a month or so now and I will never use another lotion on my skin again. And you can&#x27;t beat the price, I was spending a small fortune on tiny jars of lotion at Sephora and Ulta. This is soooo much more affective and cheaper! Thank you!</li>
    <li> very good. it was all we expected it to be.</li>
    <li> Love this product. It makes my skin so soft, even my face! I have to be careful not to use to much.</li>
    <li> Zero stars. It&#x27;s great the plastic is UV protectant. While the shea butter smelled fine, the texture is grainy, like little beads of sand. I use shea in whipped body butters and this one ruined my recipes. It melted fine, but when it dried, it dried back into sand like pebbles. Very odd. Maybe a horrible batch? Even if so, I will not order this brand again. Will be returning.</li>
    <li> Love it, very moisturizing. I use it to make body butter. The only downside is a smell. But if you use it with something else like coco butter then most likely you won&#x27;t feel the smell that bad. I plan on adding essential oil to my body butter this way I don&#x27;t feel this sent at all. I gave this product 5 stars because it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Bought to make homemade beauty products. Has worked great so far!</li>
    <li> Always arrives quickly, and quality is awesome. Will buy again and again.</li>
    <li> Good product. Glad to be putting something wholesome on my body.</li>
    <li> Really great product. Smells weird but that&#x27;s the beauty of it. Makes my skin glow and gives me an even complexion.</li>
    <li> im addicted now ... will be ordering more</li>
    <li> I would give this 5 stars if I could use without having to mix it with other oils. It is great for making a luxurious body butter. Overall, I really like it.</li>
    <li> It was extremely hot when, I placed my order. When, I received the jar, the shea butter was melted and I was unable to use it. Never got the chance to use it. Not the product fault, it was just to hot outside.</li>
    <li> Great quality, arrived promptly.  There is plenty of butter here- it should last me a good long while.  Great for preventing face chapping in cold windy weather.</li>
    <li> it is working good, I recommend it</li>
    <li> Love this product!! I will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a good moisturizer with zero chemicals added and finally found this stuff. It hydrates and smooths skin wonderfully. Application can feel thick if you don&#x27;t properly rub it in your hands and make give it a bit more liquidity. It&#x27;s solid in the jar, which is nice for not grabbing too much or too little. After a few applications I have how to use this stuff down and I will never buy lotion again.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! Should of been using this instesd of buying expensive lotion.</li>
    <li> I so love this. It leaves my skin feeling so soft.</li>
    <li> Very soft and smooth. Spoons easily out of the jar.</li>
    <li> It was my first time using shea butter. In short, I have two issues with this product. 1. It smells like a rancid oil. I&#x27;m not sure how it was processed (it say raw but...) and handled. How long has it been out there? Is this how it supposed to smell? Coco butter smells wonderful. Coconut Oil smells great and I know when it (if ever) goes bad. I&#x27;m not sure if I want to use this on my skin care product.&lt;br /&gt;2. Why is it so expensive? The description says that african people using it for a lot of purposes. I can not image they will use this expensive product ($15 / lb). I can imaging with USDA label, and all those media blitz for &amp;#34;natural cosmetic&amp;#34; companies/products, mark up is high. But I think it is way too much. Conclusion : There are better smelling, better proven, more reasonably priced ingredients than shea butter. Like goji berry and all other hyped products, this one seems to be one of those &#x27;money making&#x27; ingredients and I hope true &#x27;natural product&#x27; lover do not support these type of frenzy.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  At first touch, it does feel hard and slightly grainy but once it is warmed and rubbed between the hands to soften it, it spreads smoothly.  It also goes a long way.  My skin feels smoother.  I love using it during these dry winter months on my face and body.  I have not tried it on my hair though I have heard and read that it is good for hair as well.</li>
    <li> This company really has an outstanding product here.  Love the shea butter in a jar but I could not find out if the plastic jar is BPA free.  Otherwise love the jar it makes my cabinets look neater.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using it everyday and it&#x27;s as good as nature allows.  Got nothing to complaint about.  Nice product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it on my hair as a mask and rinsing with dish soap the next morning. I think it is making a difference in my hair. HOWEVER it stinks really bad! lol</li>
    <li> This is very high quality.  It doesn&#x27;t smell bad like other shea butter I&#x27;ve bought.  I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> well.... it is too heavy for my skin, but it is very good. I use it only with night creams.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s creamy, smooth, mildly scented naturally. I mixed it with essential oils to suit my olfactory preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took 4 Tsp. of Shea butter, add 10 drops of orange oil, 8 drops of levander oil, and 6 drops of eucliptus oil, mixed it with a knife, store in a jar, voila, a great skin moisturizer is done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it every where on my body!</li>
    <li> Great Product...Will definitely purchase through this vendor again!</li>
    <li> Love this product and I always receive it in good time.</li>
    <li> Works very well. No complaints.</li>
    <li> This is the best shea butter that I have purchased and I have tried many. Some were too stiff and sticky, or had an artificial yellowish color (allegedly with no additives). The smell is clean, the consistency is fluffy, the appearance is granular (but not in texture, it&#x27;s smooth. As to the appearance, imagine how sugar and butter look when it has been creamed in the mixer. I think some people may have problems with the hardness because of cooler temperatures. I happen to live in a a warm climate so that might be a factor in explaining the texture difference. I even like this shea butter more than the Jamaican castor oil for cuticles and under eye because the butter stays put and doesn&#x27;t run. Just a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This Shea Butter is so rich and decadent. Transitioning from typical store-bought body moisturizers, I was afraid the move to a raw and organic product might be hard to adjust to. This Shea Butter is far more luxurious than any high end lotion I&#x27;ve ever used, plus no creepy ingredients! With no real scent to speak of, it doesn&#x27;t throw off my perfume fragrances or become irritating on your senses after a while. Plus, it&#x27;s nice to support a company that seems to have integrity. Definitely buying this again.</li>
    <li> Love this Shea butter. The company sent along some useful information I was not aware of and I received my order promptly.</li>
    <li> It is perfect. I will continue to only buy this brand. It is everything that they state.</li>
    <li> I live in Arizona where the arid climate sucks the moisture out of everything. I use this on my feet at night, right after a treatment with the Emjoi micro-pedi.  It melts in your hands nicely.  Every now and then I&#x27;ll also use argan oil.  I like this product because it&#x27;s just pure shea butter without any of the nonsense, and you get a ton of it.</li>
    <li> This product has worked great on my 8 month old son who has terrible eczema. I have been using it on him for a few months and love it!</li>
    <li> I love this product! The texture is soft, smooth, and the light color and very light scent are wonderful for my products.  I use it directly on my skin for real softness!</li>
    <li> love this product.  this is my first time buying and will buy again  4 stars bc it&#x27;s hard to get out of the tub, but I think that is just the product.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product! This is my first time using Raw Shea Butter. I love how it makes my skin look and feel. I was also very happy that the Company sent a follow up on how to use the product and suggested areas to apply the product. I read that it can be applied to hair and so I did! Very sparingly to some of the drier pieces along the back and crown area. It has helped to smooth and create some shine to the duller hair. Nice Bonus. The only drawback that I noticed is that now I am receiving too many follow up emails. :( I have now had to unsubscribe from them.</li>
    <li> Best Raw Shea that I&#x27;ve purchased for my homemade lotions and hair product.  Awesome for African Americans for body and hair. Highly recommend this supplier.</li>
    <li> This is the best I&#x27;ve found (at least so far!) and the price is excellent.  It is very thick but melts after spreading on your hands, which is where I use it.  I think it might be difficult to spread elsewhere, but not impossible.  Heels would be easy.</li>
    <li> Will definitely buy again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m addicted to this stuff. For years, I&#x27;ve used B&amp;BW body creams on my kids. I&#x27;ve finally been awakened to all of the chemicals I&#x27;d been rubbing in them daily. With this, I just add a few drops of whatever essential oils I want and rub them down. Their skin feels amazing and I feel like I&#x27;m doing such good for them. No more gmo, chemical filled lotions for this family!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Good product, melts into skin. Smells funny though, don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s to be expected</li>
    <li> I REALLY LIKE THIS. IT SAYS TO USE WITHIN SIX MONTHS. A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY SO IT MAY TAKE ME SIX YEARS TO USE THIS UP!! II</li>
    <li> This product is a lifesaver for my skin, and has proven especially useful this winter. Yes, it is a little hard to scoop out of the container, but once it is warmed up it glides well, and the moisturizing benefits last a long time.</li>
    <li> This is my first time purchasing Raw Shea Butter, and this is amazing, I love it! I was afraid, after reading about so many shea butters that were unpleasant or icky. But this is very nice, a lovely cream on its own right out of the jar, and a great mix in for hair, and skin.</li>
    <li> This shea butter is great quality!  I love how well it absorbs into my skin.  Thank you very much, I will be ordering more once I use it all up.</li>
    <li> Shea butter came quickly and as advertised. Ample size jar and enough butter to last a good while. As other reviewers have noted, when using the shea butter, it will come out in small pieces. A little bit goes a long way, so go lightly at first to get the amount thats right for you.  I took a shower, and applied the shea butter. I held a piece in my hand, and it melted quickly in my hand, at which time I began applying the butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially, there is a \\&quot;nutty\\&quot; smell, but dissipates quickly. Immediately I noticed a difference between this butter and other lotions I have used over the years. It goes into my skin quicky, and honest to God, it felt like my skin just soaked it up and then said \\&quot;thank you\\&quot;. It lasts, does not make me feel greasy, and it seems to hydrate my skin. Others have used this with coconut oil to make a nice lotion. I&#x27;m a man, so I just scoop a little bit of the shea butter, hold it in my hand 15-20 seconds, and apply to my body. Store bought lotions are history for me now. I will always keep this on hand. I would definitely recommend this shea butter.</li>
    <li> Very generous size for the price. Product shipped quickly from Amazon. Personally, I love the &amp;#34;nutty&amp;#34; smell...it does not over power. This is pure Shea, and is great for deep trouble on hands, cuticles, feet, split ends and chapped lips.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful shea butter. I like products that have no scent &amp; this has none. Very smooth. I bought it to use as an ingredient in hand &amp; body lotion, but I&#x27;ve been using it straight out of the container &amp; love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
    <li> Clean container. Good smell, product as expected.</li>
    <li> Shea butter is great!! I use it for everything</li>
    <li> My 18 month old has horrible eczema especially on his legs. I&#x27;ve tried several other products on the market without any success. I hated the idea of putting moisturizers with chemicals on his skin but knew he needed something to help relieve his eczema so this was my last shot at trying something natural.  After applying it within a day his skin had improved significantly!  I love this product and i love that it has 100% natural ingredients. I highly recommend this if you struggle with dry skin or eczema.</li>
    <li> 100% Pure Shea Butter!  When I was younger my grandfather would bring back huge seeds filled with Shea Butter.  I always remembered how it felt, the scent and all the colors (varying shades of ivory or a very light yellow.)  The Shea Butter sold by Perfect Body Harmony matches that very closely.  Only difference is I don&#x27;t have to weight and jar my own Shea Butter.</li>
    <li> Although have only had the product one week,  I&#x27;m very happy with it. Multiple uses, esp. For that dry skin on the heels and elbows. The whole family is getting use from this large tub.</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing and seems like it can be used for a variety of purposes. I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell, but it&#x27;s not strong so you can&#x27;t smell it on your skin later. It&#x27;s organic/raw, so an unpleasant smell is not that surprising. I&#x27;m very happy to use something like this instead of processed lotions since I have very sensitive skin. Seems like it would be good for all skin types.</li>
    <li> Smelled terrible and extremely grainy. Have bought many other brands and have never come across either problem.</li>
    <li> very lovely consistency. Made some deoderant and shaving cream!</li>
    <li> I cannot even believe the quality of this shea butter. I ordered two jars and I am reviewing one of them. The smell and quality is amazing. I have ordered different brand shea butters and none compare to this one. The customer service matches the product. AWESOME! I had an issue with one of the jars and the company was so polite, helpful, and willing to make a customer satisfied. I will continue to buy products from this line knowing how great the quality and service is and I will also recommend it to everyone I know.</li>
    <li> Love it.  I&#x27;ve been using on my skin alone, and mixing with coconut oil and various essential oils for a facial moisturizer. Great quality shea butter. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I received my Shea Butter several day&#x27;s ago &amp; love it. I has kept my skin very moistened for the short time that i have used it, no greasy felling . My girlfriend just loves also and has commandeered it from me, thank god that i purchased the large size.</li>
    <li> This is great. Came as expected. Melts quickly &amp; keeps my skin soft. It&#x27;s definitely the real deal.</li>
    <li> I love this butter.  I use it for my homemade deodorant, body lotions and chapstick recipes and it&#x27;s an amazingly nourishing product.  The color is a creamy off-white and not yellow like other shea butters.</li>
    <li> Handled my alligator skin on my forearms. Sun damaged from several years of outdoor selling in the hot California sun I&#x27;d just about given up on getting my normally \\&quot;soft\\&quot; skin back. Three days of raw shea butter and WHOA what a difference.I recommend this product to anyone who thinks their skin is \\&quot;too far gone\\&quot; I just took a glob, and rubbed my  hands together till  it liquified and my hands got kind of warm from the friction, then I just smeared it on  my skin.  My elbows are smooth again too. Used it on my somewhat dry hair (messy but it seems to work). After shampooing  it out, and towel drying  and then air drying my hair was softer and had more body. Re-moisturized is what I&#x27;d call it. I love this product. It&#x27;s good for 6 months once you buy it and refrigeration may extend it&#x27;s shelf life. Gonna be a staple for me as  long as I can get it  at this price.</li>
    <li> Love the stuff, even the distinctive smell, once I got used to it. Also liking it is the expanding group of friends to  whom I keep giving some of the shea  -- gals gotta share!  Great for winter dryness and cold weather! Great for sensitive skin. A little oily when first applied (rub around on your hand to melt) but absorbs into the skin after a bit.</li>
    <li> Great product. It arrived very quickly and is awesome!  I use it on my excema and other dry skin areas.  I am also going to give some to a friend to try on her dry, frizzy hair.  Oh and I actually used it to also condition some leather furniture I have.  It worked perfectly!</li>
    <li> Creamy, hard with just enough ability to dig finger in. Plastic container. Great quality.</li>
    <li> Great product! Very high quality and simply luxurious for the skin. It is much more impressive than I expected at creating a hydrophobic barrier on the skin. I imagine it would be beneficial to those suffering from exzema. Not greasy, blends well after warming between fingers; I HIGHLY recommend</li>
    <li> Great product, great price, great service.</li>
    <li> Really oily, so a little goes a long way in my transitioning hair. It stopped the breakage almost immediately. The product has a grainy texture but goes away when you rub it between your palms to warm it up.</li>
    <li> This product is great. I use it at night belapse it&#x27;s a little heavy for this Texas heat. It is exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;This is the best product I have used for the healing process for my skin. No itching during the healing process. I love how its package and the directions.  I do believe it helps with the circulation for my skin!</li>
    <li> There are many shea products available on Amazon. This is the one you want. It is very high quality and does not have the discoloration or weird smell that other products have. As a guy, it has done wonders on the dry skin on my elbows and feet. I love that it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film on areas of application. It absorbs very quick and leaves no lotion type of scent. I use the product everyday and this 17.5 oz jar lasts me months so the price is great as well.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product and very impressive.  I had a problem with my first order and the Company immediately made it right.  They are the best, as is their product.  I would not hesitate ordering from them over and over.</li>
    <li> I really love this product.  I can&#x27;t believe how smooth my skin feels after using it.  The nutty scent is wonderful, too.  After I bought the first jar to use in my new soap making hobby, I bought a second jar just for putting directly on my dry skin.  I immediately had compliments on how much younger my face looked. What a bonus! I keep the shea butter in a dark cool spot in the house and it is keeping just fine. I haven&#x27;t tried making any soap yet (still collecting ingredients and supplies) so I can&#x27;t say how the shea butter works for that. The product arrived quickly and well packaged, and the follow up by the company was both surprising (first company I ever bought from that I can recall do that) and welcome in that it made me more willing to buy from them again.</li>
    <li> We use ALOT of shea butter in our household, this was definitely the best quality.  Will definitely order again.  Thanks!!!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product! You will notice the positive results on your skin and hair immediately. I will definitely purchase this product again. Angela</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the quality of this product as a skin moisturizer. I have been very leery over the years about all the moisturizers on the market. Since our skin is the largest organ of our body, I am making sure I only use what will be healthy for me. I feel confident this product fills my needs. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Just started using this and so far so good. Will need to finish the entire thing to leave a more detailed review.</li>
    <li> It is fabulous, love the smell, feels nice all over my body. will order more. packaged nice.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Bought it for my kids eczema and it immediately cleared it up, and I started using it on my pregnant belly and my face! Love it! Wanted to make some lotions with it but I&#x27;m loving just as is!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Fast service!</li>
    <li> My 1 and 1/2 years old daughter has a severe eczema all over her body. She couldn&#x27;t sleep, rest, play, and eat well cause of her severe skin condition. I&#x27;ve tried everything, soaps, oils, cream, laundry detergent, even changed her diet. It seemed like nothing really works for her much.&lt;br /&gt;I heard about L&#x27;Occitane, the famous upscale French Shea butter cream and baby and mama balm which cost $48 per a tin can, and $20 small limp balm size tin can. It works like miracle. Cause of the price, I was looking for alternative solution. Thus I found out actual unrefined raw Shea butter is better then anything processed one. I was really hoping that this body harmony shea butter works for us.&lt;br /&gt;The very first day I applied (6 times, 2 hors duration all over her body) it to my baby. She slept more then 4 hours without scratching and it ends up bleeding. Skin tone came less red, too.&lt;br /&gt;Second day, I applied it same amount to the baby. She slept 6hrs without scratching and crying.&lt;br /&gt;The third day, she slept all night long. And her skin condition gets a lot better then 3 days ago.&lt;br /&gt;It is been 1week from the 1st day. Her skin color is almost normal, but still lots of dry spots.&lt;br /&gt;Now I apply it only 4 times a day.&lt;br /&gt;It is not greasy at all. soft and rich with earthy tree like light aroma.&lt;br /&gt;I am so thankful for that it works for my baby.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;N</li>
    <li> I purchased this because of my dry skin...and received a &amp;#34;miracle in a jar&amp;#34;!  I warm  &amp;#34;thumb nail&amp;#34; of the Shea butter in my palms and then the luxury begins as I rub the buttery wonder into my sun browned skin after a day at the beach.  What luxury!  What a wonderful result!  I am so glad that I read the reviews and ordered this miracle for my dry aging skin!  After I use the initial thumb nail of warm d butter on my neck, arms, and legs, I combine the Shea butter with my organic moisturizer and apply all over my body for a superior moisturizing effect!  I will buy this again and recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> Nice size jar with quality shea butter</li>
    <li> Love how it leaves my skin. Smell isn&#x27;t pleasant but it goes away.</li>
    <li> Very happy it came on time. Nice product. Thank you</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this shea butter!!</li>
    <li> The first time I received the Shea butter it was creamy after softening through the warmth of the skin. The second shipment was gritty and remained that way even after rubbing into the skin. Little balls of grit remained on the skin, which was annoying. I&#x27;m not sure what happened with the second jar.</li>
    <li> This has a nice consistency and does a great job of providing supplemental moisture and oil to older skin, but I found the smell quite unpleasant - having even a rancid odor, perhaps. I went back to pure coconut oil, which works just as well and smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> I was excited when I received my Shea Butter.  It came quickly, no having to wait for weeks.  I have already added it to other ingredients from Perfect Body Harmony and made my own body butter.</li>
    <li> Great Stuff!  Used it to make my own lotion and am loving it.</li>
    <li> wonderful. will not be dissaponited.</li>
    <li> I love it. Use it all over my body and my entire family uses this product too</li>
    <li> I am impressed with the size of this product, especially for the price!  The quality is superb!  I am completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> working great so far!  a little hard and grainy at first but the grains dissolve if you rub hard...</li>
    <li> *Updating March 2017. Not sure why happened with this product. My 1st purchase was Jan 2016. The container lastest me all year. My 2nd purchase Jan 2017, this jar is vastly different than the 1st. The Shea Butter is crumbly and leaves a residue.  Not happy with it at all. What happened Perfect Body Harmony?&lt;br /&gt;2 stars for being certified organic by Oregon Tith and USDA Organic.&lt;br /&gt;1 star for trying.&lt;br /&gt;________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great Product, seriously, I was hesitant to buy this because the cost of the product was lower than the other listings. But, it really is a very wonderful product. I will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> This arrived early and as described.  It&#x27;s a wonderful product for my body care recipes.</li>
    <li> I love everything about this product!</li>
    <li> this is absolutely the best shea butter I have used. From the moment I applied it the first time, my skin has been soft, supple and rejuvenated. It&#x27;s definitely worth it</li>
    <li> Beautiful product, unctuous feel and great smell</li>
    <li> This is 100% shea butter! IT REALLY IS! I gave it a few weeks of use before reviewing and can attest to the fact that this is skin changing.  After hitting 45 years of age last year my skin decided to take a turn for the dry and my arms and hands started to look like fine crumpled up paper.  I decided I was way too young for that look and started on a quest that has been very costly and has turned my bathroom shelves into a warehouse.of half used bottles of lotions and &amp;#34;miracle potions&amp;#34; - some work somewhat, some don&#x27;t.  And I&#x27;m sorry, but something that will make my skin &amp;#34;look&amp;#34; nice after my morning shower but needs to be re-touched every time I wash my hands ain&#x27;t gonna cut it... I bought this along with the coconut oil and use both before bed.  In the morning I use only the shea butter.  I also noticed my perfume lasts all day in the areas where the shea butter was applied.  I say Cool!</li>
    <li> This is a great shea butter, but I will not be purchasing again. Nothing against the actual quality of the product, but it&#x27;s so hard to get out of the container! I have to scoop out with a spoon - those who are not familiar with shea butter, shea butter is a solid product, not something you can just open and use as is as it&#x27;s very hard. Scooping out with a spoon is rather annoying, so 4 stars. Again, the product is great, just not the container. I will go back to buying in brick form.</li>
    <li> Due to Lyme Disease I have to cut out a lot of harmful products.  So my latest projects, making homemade lotion, soap and deodorant.  I ordered this based on all the raving reviews but it didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations.  I can&#x27;t comment on how well the product works because I couldn&#x27;t get pass the nasty odor!  How can this be good for me if it smells like burnt tires?!!!  I tried airing it out for 3 days but that didn&#x27;t help.  I simply cannot imagine putting this on my body let alone my face!  Not good.  UPDATE:  April 15, 2015.  I&#x27;m adding another star due to excellent customer service!  They certainly stand behind their products and will look out of their customers.  Thank you for that.   As for the Shea Butter itself, while the replacement was slightly better, the odor is still quite strong.  I have since made lotion and sunscreen using this product and gifted them to friends and family and the immediately question I get is always &amp;#34;What IS that smell&amp;#34;?!!  I know I am sensitive to certain fragrance, but in this case NO ONE I have gifted my lotion/sunscreen to seem to care for the scent either.  I have added various essential oils and nothing seem to be able to mask that odor.  I&#x27;m perplexed why store bought Shea butter doesn&#x27;t have that smell?    Anyway, smell aside... I like to mix my lotion cold whipped and not use heat.  Using this method I can get the coconut oil very creamy but not so with the Shea Butter.  When mixed together the Shea butter became very grainy with texture of sand.  So when lotioning we have to warm up the mixture with our hands first to melt it.  As a result my family is not a fan.  Perhaps shea butter is not our thing.  I will explore other options and experiment until I find something we like better.</li>
    <li> This Shea butter is great.  I used it for my face, hands and my hairs. just love it.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  Makes great body butter and lotion.</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing once rubbed in, which can take some time.  Transforms dry winter skin to something like normal!  Needs consistent use for lasting results.  Otherwise, skin will be dry again the next day, but noticeably less so than before.  All natural, effective.  Good value.  I like the smell just fine, too.  Think it may be too much in the summer (a bit sticky/greasy), but for winter skin, it&#x27;s one of the best things I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Great customer service. Great product.  Creamy and melt easier on my skin. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> So rich and wonderful. Best shea butter ever bought.</li>
    <li> This product works wonderfully. After only a few uses, my hair feels much healthier than before, and it makes my skin feel softer and healthier. It even appears to be clearing up my acne! Which is just amazing. A little also goes a very long way. I plan on whipping it with coconut oil and lavender extract to make it go even further and to allow for easier application!</li>
    <li> Bought it to make a face cream and am ending up using it all over my body!</li>
    <li> This raw Shea butter arrive quickly and in perfect condition. My family loves this Shea butter it makes our skin so soft and I have notice it is starting to lighten my fresh scar from sugrey. I will definatly order again.</li>
    <li> Been using for a week after washing with dead sea black soap on my face and I&#x27;ve already thrown out all my old skincare products. As an African American with combination skin I am AMAZED with the quality of this Shea butter. I am EXTREMELY SATISFIED. I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok.  It does soften the skin and hair nicely as Shea Butter should do, but this brand - or maybe just this batch - has a very unpleasant smokey smell to it and the butter is quite grainy before it melts on the skin.  I&#x27;ve had raw Shea Butter before and it had a smoother texture and a much fresher scent that I actually liked and could use before I went somewhere.  This one I will reserve for at home only.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item based upon my need to have something to soften my hair and the &amp;#34;great&amp;#34; reviews. However, it did not work out for me in the way I thought it would. The jar took me 10 minutes to open with a flexible grip holder. Normally opening jars are a piece of cake but this jar REALLY air tight!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me but the dull residue it left in my hair. My hair is naturally thick and curly and cut close the scalp and I put some of this on and washed out and my hair felt really bad and looked it too. I will stick to my coconut oil because it actually improves my dry hair and gives it a nice sheen. Also it is fabulous for the body and feet!! I am glad others found this product useful and beneficial but not for me. Sometimes it just works that way and that is why writing these reviews and reading them helps us in making the best decisions for our particular needs...</li>
    <li> I am in love with this stuff. Feels so good on my skin. Does not clog pores and is not greasy. Melts in your hands.</li>
    <li> Perfect for rough heels!  A little goes a long way as it melts in your hands and can be easily massaged in.</li>
    <li> It was a bit to oily for my prefference</li>
    <li> I ordered this product based off of the positive reviews. This product does leave your body feeling smooth, moisturized and soft. However, I&#x27;ve used Shea butters in the past that were creamy and smooth when applied and this product is EXTREMELY grainy. I feel like I&#x27;m rubbing sand on my body and no matter how much I rub this product into my body, particles (that look like sand) still remain on my body. I will not not order this product again.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer.  Melted quickly in hands.  Slight smell though.</li>
    <li> This product does a great job in moisturizing my skin!  I will definitely keep re-ordering it!</li>
    <li> Oh love this product. I add essential oils for frangrace too like orange or lemon</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve received not sealed and used jar of shea butter. As you can see on the picture, there is even somebody&#x27;s hair inside the jar.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> Very good. Recommend definitely</li>
    <li> Introduced to the product by a friend from Africa. Wouldn&#x27;t live without it now.</li>
    <li> awesome stuff... thought i was using the best until i tried this brand...perfect...melts quick, not gritty, bright white, perfect stuff.&lt;br /&gt;very happy with product and company....will recommend and buy again and again.</li>
    <li> Arrived within five days of purchase. It&#x27;s what the the description says it is. I whip it with other oils to make a body butter. Good stuff. Heals dried, cracked skin and keeps it moisturized. Will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Best Shea butter I have ever bought!</li>
    <li> Very creamy, love it so far.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this stuff! It keeps my skin most and looking healthy! I will buy more.</li>
    <li> Great product !!! Fresh soft</li>
    <li> Love it! Will be buying again.</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff. Very good product. After comparing to other brands this ine is by far the best! Will absolutely order again</li>
    <li> Love this butter on my body.</li>
    <li> A little hard to apply,tends to end up like beads on skin,am thinking about whipping with mixer for creamier texture, but is good for skin and ends of hair,just different texture because raw.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected. Love the product so much I bought more.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed!</li>
    <li> Works well in my handmade products</li>
    <li> amazing product  very happy with it !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to go organic in a lot of areas, especially moisturizers. I have eczema on my thumb, which to some is a blessing because many others have it all over their hand or in different areas. I still don&#x27;t like it regardless lol. Research has led me to purchase organic shea butter as a good moisturizer. It&#x27;s a little clumpy at first but after you begin to rub it in it becomes more oily, and the feeling is pretty good on my skin. My skin is kinda dry so I appreciate any good moisturizer, especially one that is not filled with junk ingredients. Just purchased this several days ago so I can&#x27;t give a treatment update on my thumb, but so far so good. I like this stuff and will probably purchase more when I begin to make my own deodorants.</li>
    <li> Leaves skin silky smooth</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It is organic, affordable, easy to use, and has helped my child&#x27;s eczema so much. Best shea we have tried to far!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product! It has been amazing for my skin during the dry winter!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for 2 weeks and I love it. I never used this type of shea butter. Compare to other shea butters, this is more pure. Smooth &amp; creamy. Great for the entire body.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described very pleased!! Can&#x27;t wait to make lots of my lotions with this!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product. It was shipped in a timely manner and I was excited to receive it. My hair is no longer dry all the time which is why I bought this product. The price was reasonable also.</li>
    <li> I just tried the product yesterday.  My first thought upon touching it was that it was so grainy that it would be impossible to use easily.  Well, color me wrong.  After rubbing the product briefly between my palms, it became smooth as silk and was easily absorbed into my skin.  I think I&#x27;m going to like this shea butter.</li>
    <li> I like the product but I didn&#x27;t at first. Once I left in the garage to melt before using it I liked it better. It was easier to use and less grainy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m LOVING this stuff! It&#x27;s so thick and rich, I love the way it makes my skin feel. Originally, I purchased it to use in homemade deodorant, but I&#x27;ve found myself using it everywhere that needs heavy duty moisture. I&#x27;ve replaced my pregnancy tummy butter with it and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with its staying-power. My skin always feels protected and moisturized!</li>
    <li> Love it. My daughter gifted me a shae butter and I was running out so I ordered this one which had better description than the one I was using. It is awesome. I&#x27;m 68 and my skin looks like I&#x27;m 55. Highly recommend it</li>
    <li> Let me start out by saying I like this product. It was shipped with 2 day free prime shipping so I didn&#x27;t have to worry about handling issues really. I got the jar as pictured, exact product.&lt;br /&gt;I use raw shea butter to make homemade body butter for my skin condition. I use it in conjunction with essential oils to treat my skin and I have found that my own home made recipe works best for me. This shea butter was sufficient to do that.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I give it 4 stars is because of the nature of the product itself that I just don&#x27;t like. Shea butter is a natural product, derived from shea nuts. that being said, it has a waxy and oily consistency at the same time. I do not like how it mixes unless it&#x27;s melted first. So when purchasing shea butter, keep in mind your mixtures (unless using it straight from the jar) will be &amp;#34;sandy&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;gritty&amp;#34; when being applied until your body heat melts it. For most people, this isn&#x27;t a problem, it melts and then can be spread on the skin. For people like me with eczema and sensitive skin, just having to pull these gritty beads of shea butter across my skin irritate it and causes more harm than good. I find that taking an extra step and using a double boiler style method of heating the shea butter works better for me but changes the texture a bit. So watch out for that sensitive skin sufferers.</li>
    <li> great product works  wonders on dry skin</li>
    <li> Works great on older tattoos! I got this for my wife as an add on item. The first day she used it (as a beauty product), she was hooked. So I decided to give it a try. I have a sleeve tattoo that is a around 6 years old. I was amazed on how this product revived all the colors! This stuff is pretty handy. Just wanted to point out that it has another use added to its long list.</li>
    <li> The shipping is super fast but not sure if I like this butter.  First of all, this is my first time to see and smell raw shea and I&#x27;m not sure if this is how it should smell. Man It smells nasty.  So i tried to mask the smell by adding essential oil.  I melted 2 TBSP in a double broiler and added almond oil and  5 ml of bergamot oil.  Unfortunately It still has the nasty smell.  So I added grapefruit oil but it still didn&#x27;t work.  Haaist!  Maybe I need to use a different essential oil? Has anyone has any suggestions how to mask this yucky smell?</li>
    <li> Starts out thick, melts down in your hands, almost feels like a light mask on your face for a bit, I use a cleanser to remove otherwise it would likely stay on your face. Amazing schtuff, would highly recommend it and recommend the seller</li>
    <li> not a good product. It crystallize after a while and it is hard to apply then.</li>
    <li> It is great. I love it. I see already a difference in my hair.</li>
    <li> great quality for body bars</li>
    <li> Great stuff! Amazing for scars, heals them quickly. Shipment came fast. Would order again.</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE it!!!!! Use it in my whole body as a moisturizer including my face.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for my skin, which tends to itch during the cold months. I use this for my lips, hands &amp; feet. Since I have a variety of essential oils, I mix lavender with this Shea butter for enhanced healing power. Truly a must-have for anyone who&#x27;d like supple skin all over the body!</li>
    <li> Excellent quality and service.</li>
    <li> I need help with this product - I am not able to use it because it does not melt and become buttery and spreadable -  it just leaves crumbles on my skin.</li>
    <li> Awesome Product! Perfect For Natural Hair! Fast Delivery, Just As Pictured And Described, Thank You</li>
    <li> This is the good stuff, very low odor can me molded into any product seamlessly.</li>
    <li> Not really a fan of the smell, but works great for dry skin.</li>
    <li> This was a much appreciated gift for someone.</li>
    <li> The butter is similar to coconut oil but it does not melt as fast.  I find that it does a very good job for softening the skin.</li>
    <li> Initially I was alarmed because the product wasn&#x27;t creamy.  After contacting supplier I learned that  rubbing a small amount in the palm of your hand softens the product and makes it easy to apply.  Great for skin in this cold weather.</li>
    <li> Amazing shea butter, melts right in your hand. Can&#x27;t get this kind of moisturizer from any other product!!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Product in a nice container. A little hard but once you dig it out and rub it in your hands it melts. It&#x27;s very creamy. I would probably re-order this product again.</li>
    <li> Very happy with product!</li>
    <li> Gee, I wanted this product to be the perfect answer to dry skin....I think it has a good chance of being that, but in my opinion it needs to be a little creamier.  I find it difficult to get it out of the jar it&#x27;s packaged in, and that starts out being a problem for me.  I wind up using my fingernail, then have to work it out from under my nail to put it into the palm of my hand to soften it up. A small scoop attatched to the jar would be a benefit! You have to work at getting this product rubbed into your skin.  It doesn&#x27;t dissolve easy, which makes it hard to rub into the dry areas.  The smell isn&#x27;t real pleasant either.  I&#x27;d prefer something a bit more pleasant. I will say tho, when I do rub this product into my hands at night, the next morning they do have a nice softness to them.....</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT/ VERY FRESH&lt;br /&gt;GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE/DELIVERY&lt;br /&gt;WOULD PURCHASE AGAIN</li>
    <li> Was what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Really good shea butter. Try whipping it with a blender or mixer to fluff it up. I bought this to mix in with essential oils and it worked really well.</li>
    <li> The very best Shea Butter customer service was amazing do not hesitate this is by far the best Shea butter around .. raw organic small company .. Love it</li>
    <li> We have tried many brands but this one is for US!  It goes on well especially after a warm shower.  (Or wash your hands in warm water.) Shea butter is very good for your skin--it stimulates the collagen...which for some of us out there thats a good thing!</li>
    <li> Great product. I make my own lotion with coconut oil and Shea butter and this is by far the best quality product for the price.</li>
    <li> Best stuff money can buy.. Love it. Excited to get more.</li>
    <li> Amazing product!! I&#x27;ve ordered several oils from this company and not only are their products top shelf but they arrive VERY quickly!!</li>
