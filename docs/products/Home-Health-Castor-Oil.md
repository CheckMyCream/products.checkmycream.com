      <li>the Top missed</li>
      <li>This oil has so many uses -</li>
      <li>This brand provides a very nice product for a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>I finally gave in and tried this product after researching and reading so many great things about it.</li>
      <li>If you find yourself getting bumps on your scalp, undiluted may be too strong for you.  </li>

      <li>Quick delivery and</li>
      <li>Through Prime, I received it quickly and well packaged.</li>
      <li>I LOVE it and would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
      <li>Right under the date.</li>
      <li>This product was exactly as advertised.</li>
      <li>So,&lt;br /&gt;be aware.</li>
      <li>This one bottle will go a loooooong way, but if I do need to get more, i&#x27;ll be back.</li>
      <li>Out of all the things I ordered, this is what came first.</li>
      <li>I am glad I gave this a shot, I feel like it was worth the purchase and risk due to the inexpensive cost and amount of product.</li>
      <li>But, i&#x27;m sure it will take a very long time to see a difference in lash growth</li>
      <li>I purchased the smallest size available and predict the bottle will last me well over six months.</li>
      <li>This is a very organic castor oil.</li>
      <li>I used this on my eyelashes because there are so many reviews on Youtube and other places that say it will grow eyelashes and hair.</li>
      <li>I have been using it frequently and in multiple ways, and so far I really love this stuff.</li>
      <li>So I am trying this whole new face wash that I found out on Pinterest (Castor Oil and EVOO).</li>
      <li>This works better than any serum I ever purchased and can&#x27;t believe how much money I wasted on serums in a fruitless attempt to get my lashes to grow.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to determine whether or not it is effective for hair growth, but I am very pleased with the various other results I have gotten and will continue to use this product religiously.</li>
      <li>I believe it is a great alternative to expensive products and treatments for lots of uses.</li>
      <li>A little goes a long way, I use it for so many things regularly and I only need about quarter sized amounts for my longer hair and full lotion bottles, and a tablespoon at a time for multiple eyelash applications (to make sure I am not wasting a lot of product).</li>
      <li>I needed the type taken orallym and all that ordered those same other products im sure did as well.</li>
      <li>Obviously, with anything and pretty much everything, you will have to have patience and willingness to continue routines and experiments to find out what suites your individual needs.</li>
      <li>It is too thick and heavy for me to use to use all over my hair,but around the areas like the hairline and the ends that are prone to breakage...it is really great.</li>
      <li>and I haven&#x27;t seen a difference so far.</li>
      <li>I do not use it all over, just on sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It makes my hair softer and shiny, and my skin soft and moisturized.</li>
      <li>This is worth giving a try, so many people report different benefits how could you go wrong?</li>
      <li>so I buy several brands as long as they are 100% / pure castor.  </li>
      <li>but if it&#x27;s really 100% pure castor oil as it&#x27;s being sold as, doesn&#x27;t that mean it&#x27;s food grade?</li>
      <li>I was surprised, therefore, to read on the bottle when it arrived: FOR EXTERNAL USE ONLY.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I used this on my eyelashes because there are so many reviews on Youtube and other places that say it will grow eyelashes and hair. I got a slight infection on my eyelid so I stopped using after getting some of the oil in my eye and it slighlty gave a burning sensation.</li>
    <li> the Top missed I dont know to keep this oil when I will remove the cap</li>
    <li> I just purchased the iPhone6 and it was driving me crazy that every screen protector sold did not cover the whole screen. I was so happy when this product arrived and it cover the entire screen. As someone who has cracked iPhone screens numerous times I swear by the tempered glass protectors. This was easily applied and works perfect. The only down fall I had was a piece of white string that was already on the sticky part of the protector and was not removable. You can see it in the picture Right under the date.</li>
    <li> Great product at an excellent price! Seller marketed the product correctly and package was delivered on time.</li>
    <li> I decided to buy this after reading an article from the People&#x27;s Pharmacy.In the comments, people were talking about using the oil to treat different skin conditions. I have eczema and some other skin conditions so I thought I would give it a try. I have not had a miracle result yet, seeing I have only had it for about a week. However, I do some see a difference already. Lotion often irritates my skin, no matter what I use, from fragrances, hidden additives... it always tends to cause problems. The castor oil penetrated and soften even very rough patches on my skin. It absorbs well so you are not walking around greasy. I do not use it all over, just on sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used it to soothe dry, inflamed scalp. It immediately felt better. I use it to seal the ends of my curly hair. It is too thick and heavy for me to use to use all over my hair,but around the areas like the hairline and the ends that are prone to breakage...it is really great. This is worth giving a try, so many people report different benefits how could you go wrong?</li>
    <li> Out of all the things I ordered, this is what came first. Quick delivery and well, it&#x27;s castor oil. I&#x27;ve been using it on my eyebrows and eyelashes to grow them back a little fuller after years of abuse. Pretty good results so far. This one bottle will go a loooooong way, but if I do need to get more, i&#x27;ll be back.</li>
    <li> I finally gave in and tried this product after researching and reading so many great things about it. I have been using it frequently and in multiple ways, and so far I really love this stuff. This brand provides a very nice product for a reasonable price. I have been massaging it into my scalp and hair, mixing it into my lotions, and buffing it into my face after cleansing with a cotton ball before bed. It makes my hair softer and shiny, and my skin soft and moisturized. It almost instantly got rid of my dry spots around my nose and eyebrows on my face, and has faded my acne scars. I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to determine whether or not it is effective for hair growth, but I am very pleased with the various other results I have gotten and will continue to use this product religiously. A little goes a long way, I use it for so many things regularly and I only need about quarter sized amounts for my longer hair and full lotion bottles, and a tablespoon at a time for multiple eyelash applications (to make sure I am not wasting a lot of product). I purchased the smallest size available and predict the bottle will last me well over six months. I have found various recipes online for a range of uses for this stuff and definitely recommend at least giving this a try. I believe it is a great alternative to expensive products and treatments for lots of uses. Obviously, with anything and pretty much everything, you will have to have patience and willingness to continue routines and experiments to find out what suites your individual needs. Sometimes things that work well for someone don&#x27;t work for you, and it&#x27;s a bummer when you spend $60.00 on some &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; product and it ends up not doing what it claims. I am glad I gave this a shot, I feel like it was worth the purchase and risk due to the inexpensive cost and amount of product. I was not paid or asked to write this review, or contacted by the seller in any way except for a default email offering servicesif I was unhappy with the product. This is my honest opinion and experience. I will purchase again when I run out.</li>
    <li> I bought this so I could grow out my lashes and brows. This works better than any serum I ever purchased and can&#x27;t believe how much money I wasted on serums in a fruitless attempt to get my lashes to grow. I noticed results within a week of using it every night. My lashes grew longer and thicker and I saw a bunch of tiny baby lashes growing in by the end of the week. I also used it in my brows since they were sparse and it made them grow out like crazy!! This is a really big bottle so it&#x27;ll last for a really long time. So happy I got this.</li>
    <li> This is my&lt;br /&gt;second time buying the 8oz castor oil next time I will be buying the bigger one I told my daughter about castrol oil and she loves it and I love it because it helps our hair to grow fast and be healthier</li>
    <li> I have dry eyes due to Rx&#x27;s. Web MD said that castor oil can be used in eyes. Oh my goodness, after only 2 nights I am so happy with the success. My eyes feel so much better! I use a glass and rubber dropper to drop into my eyes. I have also added a couple drops to lotion in my hand for better body lotion.</li>
    <li> This product was exactly as advertised. Through Prime, I received it quickly and well packaged. The quality is excellent and I have had great success using it with the Oil Cleansing Method.</li>
    <li> received item as listed.  I will buy it again in the future.</li>
    <li> I needed the type taken orallym and all that ordered those same other products im sure did as well. Also when returning it was told she found the oral type castor oil and was lead to believe she was going to switch them out but yet a week later still no package because there was no order?</li>
    <li> This is a very organic castor oil. The consistency is quite thick and I use it on my lashes because castor oil is supposed to help lash growth. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week and I haven&#x27;t seen a difference so far. But, i&#x27;m sure it will take a very long time to see a difference in lash growth so I can&#x27;t judge it yet!</li>
    <li> Love this oil. I bought it to use on my hands and feet and it works great. No more cracked heels or finger tips.</li>
    <li> Good product I use it in my hair and on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;After workouts I massage it on my sore muscles.</li>
    <li> This oil has so many uses - but I use this on my scalp. This is wonderful for hair growth and strengthening plus it&#x27;s a great moisturizer! Just rub this on the scalp a couple of times a day and you will be AMAZED! This oil is thick and not runny, if you don’t like the smell or thickness you can mix with other carrier oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a severe hair loss issue and using this oil helped me grow my hair back in a couple of months! Consistency is the KEY! I LOVE it and would highly recommend it to anyone. If you find yourself getting bumps on your scalp, undiluted may be too strong for you.  Simply mix other olive, jojoba or another oil to ease the sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used NUMEROUS brands of Regular Castor and Black Castor Oil - just look for 100% or pure and you can&#x27;t go wrong with either type or brand. I have indeed posted reviews on different brands because I have used these brands.  I use castor oil on my hair and my daughters’ hair and I mix my own hair products so I buy several brands as long as they are 100% / pure castor.  I hope this review helps!!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I read that castor oil is a good remedy for constipation. I was surprised, therefore, to read on the bottle when it arrived: FOR EXTERNAL USE ONLY. DO NOT INGEST. I called the company and was told this isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;food grade&amp;#34;-- but if it&#x27;s really 100% pure castor oil as it&#x27;s being sold as, doesn&#x27;t that mean it&#x27;s food grade? In any case, nowhere that I read in the product description does it say not for internal use. So,&lt;br /&gt;be aware.</li>
    <li> So I am trying this whole new face wash that I found out on Pinterest (Castor Oil and EVOO). My skin feels amazing! Looks Amazing! Glad I ran into this product!</li>
    <li> EDGAR CAYCE&#x27;S FAVORITE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look up the recommends he makes regarding The Palma Christi Oil.</li>
