      <li>We much prefer the similat VS lotion advertised as coconut but actually coconut and vanilla.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I expected.  </li>
      <li>When I used one of the new bottles, I found the scent was vastly different.  </li>
      <li>My son even commented on the scent and when I returned every bottle to the store (along with one of my old bottles for comparison), the store clerk even admitted they were different.  </li>

    <li> I ordered it for my wife.  The lotion is okay but we were both very disappointed with the fragrance which is not just vanilla as advertised.  It is really vanilla and MUSK!

    <li> Nice Fragrance, graphics and quick shipping.</li>
    <li> Nice product, quality, quick shipping</li>
    <li> Little known fact, this lotion repels mosquitoes!  I just purchased more for my family to take to camp - it&#x27;s a genuine vanilla smell so the boys don&#x27;t mind wearing it.  Win, win!</li>
    <li> Loaded with harmful chemicals. Enough said.</li>
    <li> Order arrived on time. Love the fragrance and lasts a long time. Makes my whole body smell good and feel soft. My husband likes it too and that&#x27;s very important ❤</li>

    <li> This lotion smells amazing. Sweet vanilla, with a hint of &#x27;musk&#x27;, which to me smells more like aromatic spice... something like vanilla with a light tobacco.&lt;br /&gt;It linger, it lasts, it makes a creamy statement without being overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;The lotion is silky, soaks in quickly, and feels as good as it smells.</li>

    <li> Beautiful lasting scent!</li>
    <li> I have been on a search for a true vanilla fragrance and I found it! The last time I went to have my nails done the girl asked me if I was baking!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After getting out of the shower I&#x27;ll put it on when expecting company and they always believe I baked them cookies!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh my, I didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;My bad.</li>

    <li> Delightful Vanilla Fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;You lovers of the sweet Vanilla&lt;br /&gt;will enjoy this.</li>
    <li> I have used Victoria&#x27;s Secret Vanilla Lace body lotion for years and years.  I usually buy it once a year during a sale.  Last month, I stocked up.  When I used one of the new bottles, I found the scent was vastly different.  It wasn&#x27;t the subtle vanilla scent I have always loved, but a perfumey scent with a hint of Play Doh.  I wanted to take a shower just to get the smell off.  My son even commented on the scent and when I returned every bottle to the store (along with one of my old bottles for comparison), the store clerk even admitted they were different.  The old bottles say \\&quot;vanilla, orchid, amber and musk\\&quot; while the new bottles just say \\&quot;vanilla and musk.\\&quot;  I don&#x27;t know what they have done to the Vanilla Lace formula, but this isn&#x27;t the Vanilla Lace I have loved for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  Six months after writing this review, I went by Victoria&#x27;s Secret again to try the Vanilla Lace lotion.  This time, the scent was the Vanilla Lace I was used to and I stocked up.  My suggestion would be to make sure you smell, and even try, the lotion before purchasing.</li>
    <li> este producto es excelente comprar aqui es buenisimo llega a tiempo y en perfectas condiciones sin mayor complicacion . .</li>
    <li> Always have to have this, it is the best Vanilla lotion ever.</li>
    <li> Its good but not as good as the other ones I got sick of it after a while</li>
    <li> Love it.  I use all 3...the body wash, the body lotion and this spray every day.  I love vanilla and this seems to last and last.</li>
    <li> My GF likes it, so I am happy.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a present for my grandaughter and she loved - she likes the perfume and enjoys using the product</li>
    <li> excellent. responsible. 100% recommend</li>
    <li> Not the original vanilla lace. Gross</li>
    <li> LOVED IT SENSE HIGH SCHOOL. MY FRIEND JENY R. WORE IT AND I HAVE BEEN A FAN OF IT SINCE I WAS 16.</li>
    <li> The bottle says vanilla and musk. The scent has neither. It reminds me of eggnog. I like eggnog but I don&#x27;t want to smell like it. I would use this during the holidays only. The lotion on its own does leave a little bit of a greasy feel after application.</li>
    <li> Victoria secrets stuff is always great. You can just use a little bit of it  and it lasts all day long</li>
    <li> The amount of vanilla seems to be considerably less than it used to be. Some of the other scents appear to be more fragrant.</li>
