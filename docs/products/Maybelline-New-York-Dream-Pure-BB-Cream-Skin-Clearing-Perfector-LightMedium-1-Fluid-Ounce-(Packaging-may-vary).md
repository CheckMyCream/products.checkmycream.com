      <li>but that&#x27;s my fault for not reading lol.</li>
      <li>Matches my Dutch/black Irish/mutt complexion wonderfully with a perfect cooler beige color, and leaves my skin smooth and feeling amazing.  </li>
      <li>AND IT WENT PERFECT WITH MY DAUGHTER&#x27;S LIGHT COLORED SKIN.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re someone or a guy looking for somewhat better skin, try this out!  </li>
      <li>I always used Kat Von D lock it tatto foundation, but when I saw this at Walmart, I felt in love with it!</li>
      <li>Anyways to end this in a high note, try it out people! :D</li>
      <li>warm toned skin color.  </li>
      <li>It covers all the blemish on my face, very easy to apply.</li>
      <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE it.  </li>
      <li>Love love LOVE this BB cream.  </li>
      <li>, it makes my skin look way better but not to the point where people ask, &amp;#34;yo, you wear MAKEUP?&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I love this because one, it doesn&#x27;t cause acne and two</li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>Favorite makeup product porbabbly</li>
      <li>works great and came in fast</li>
      <li>This BB cream goes on so smooth and blends nicely.</li>
      <li>Its smooth, light weight, but still offers a really perfect amount of medium coverage.  </li>
      <li>And yes I&#x27;m straight, if you had my problems you would understand... :P</li>
      <li>Its not for anyone who wants a good coverage.</li>
      <li>But I suppose would work well for anyone who has nice skin and wants a light coverage.</li>
      <li>The coverage is light and even and the makeup doesn&#x27;t cake up on my face.</li>
      <li>FANTASTIC MAKEUP FOR BUMPY FACES.</li>
      <li>but this is too light for me.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s way to light for me.</li>
      <li>All in all, I feel more confident and so far</li>
      <li>totally worth switching from high end foundations to this one :)</li>
      <li>If someone asks you why your skin looks better, just say you got a new moisturizer prescribed...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried the original dream bb cream and the medium matched my med/tan skin pretty close</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great to even my skintone without feeling my face too heavy.</li>
      <li>Totally worth it and</li>
      <li>So far it hasn&#x27;t caused more breakouts</li>
      <li>It covers my face well yet still manages to look natural, which I love.</li>
      <li>While it does prevent and clear most of my acne, I still break out from it</li>
      <li>The best part is there is salicylic acid in it, so its perfect for nights spent at the boyfriends house, mixed with moisturizer, its adds just enough color to lay in bed and not look run down or done up.  </li>
      <li>Very reasonable price.</li>
      <li>It also layers pretty well</li>
      <li>Love it, not too heAvy goes on smooth..</li>
      <li>Love this bb cream because it lasts long</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not even close to my skintone, I had to double check because I thought I ordered the light or light/med.  </li>
      <li>Provides light coverage, with minimal fragrance, not really visible when I mix it with a bit of moisturizer before applying, but even the skin tone nicely.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve really noticed a decrease in my acne since using this.</li>
      <li>I gently tap it into my skin with my fingertips.</li>
      <li>haha.</li>
      <li>Very nice and thin</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m pretty self conscious about my acne marks.</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;m a dude in high school</li>
      <li>, I got medium which is normal for me</li>
      <li>Cant live without it.</li>
      <li>Makes my skin so soft too !</li>
      <li>I like BB creams because I don&#x27;t like to wear heavy makeup, and its an easy way to use moisturizer in one step in the morning.</li>
      <li>: So does it clear acne?</li>
      <li>but his tint is pretty grey</li>
      <li>I was really excited to try it, but it leaves a streaky finish and turned out a little orange.</li>
      <li>Much lighter than I expected.</li>
      <li>Since it&#x27;s so light, I use a little bit of concealer underneath in trouble areas.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Its was just ehhh for me. Made me look cakey and didnt conceal, no oil control. Its not for anyone who wants a good coverage. But I suppose would work well for anyone who has nice skin and wants a light coverage.</li>
    <li> works great and came in fast</li>
    <li> Much lighter than I expected.With try a darker shade next time.</li>
    <li> Favorite makeup product porbabbly</li>
    <li> Where do I even start! This is great, blends with my skin so perfectly nobody could tell (LOL). Makes my skin so soft too ! The bottle is smaller than I excpected but that&#x27;s my fault for not reading lol.</li>
    <li> Love it, not too heAvy goes on smooth..</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great to even my skintone without feeling my face too heavy. So far it hasn&#x27;t caused more breakouts</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried the original dream bb cream and the medium matched my med/tan skin pretty close but this is too light for me.  It&#x27;s not even close to my skintone, I had to double check because I thought I ordered the light or light/med.  I&#x27;m going to have to order the medium/deep hopefully that will work for me because I like this bb cream a lot.</li>
    <li> This product is awful, waste of money.</li>
    <li> I always used Kat Von D lock it tatto foundation, but when I saw this at Walmart, I felt in love with it! It&#x27;s has really good coverage and its 95% cheaper! I payed 5-6$ I believe! Totally worth it and totally worth switching from high end foundations to this one :)</li>
    <li> It covers my face well yet still manages to look natural, which I love. I&#x27;ve really noticed a decrease in my acne since using this. I used to get quite a few pimples on my forhead, but they&#x27;ve almost diminished since I ordered this a few weeks ago.</li>
    <li> Love love LOVE this BB cream.  It&#x27;s part of my go-to everyday four-product lineup: this, eyeliner, lipstick, and finishing powder.  It breaks my heart that I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore.  Very sheer and lightweight, so it lets my freckles show through, but it tones down the patchy redness in my cheeks and circles under my eyes.  Matches my Dutch/black Irish/mutt complexion wonderfully with a perfect cooler beige color, and leaves my skin smooth and feeling amazing.  In short, the ultimate daily wear product.</li>
    <li> I use this every now and then. I was really excited to try it, but it leaves a streaky finish and turned out a little orange.</li>
    <li> Great product and service, I will order these again!</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m a dude in high school and I&#x27;m pretty self conscious about my acne marks. :/ To make a long story short, I decided that I could try to cover them without covering them too much if that makes any sense... Anyways, so I went online and researched for a product to do such thing and walla! I found it! I love this because one, it doesn&#x27;t cause acne and two, it makes my skin look way better but not to the point where people ask, &amp;#34;yo, you wear MAKEUP?&amp;#34; haha. All in all, I feel more confident and so far, no one&#x27;s noticed. If you&#x27;re someone or a guy looking for somewhat better skin, try this out!  2 weeks later Update: So does it clear acne? The answer is yes and no... While it does prevent and clear most of my acne, I still break out from it but the acne I get from this product is small and usually goes away fast. But don&#x27;t let this discourage you, I think it&#x27;s my somewhat dry skin causing the acne, not the bb cream tbh. :)  P.S. And yes I&#x27;m straight, if you had my problems you would understand... :P If someone asks you why your skin looks better, just say you got a new moisturizer prescribed... Anyways to end this in a high note, try it out people! :D</li>
    <li> Love this bb cream because it lasts long and it&#x27;s inexpensive.</li>
    <li> This BB cream goes on so smooth and blends nicely. I gently tap it into my skin with my fingertips. The coverage is light and even and the makeup doesn&#x27;t cake up on my face. Since it&#x27;s so light, I use a little bit of concealer underneath in trouble areas. Only negative is it doesn&#x27;t have SPF.</li>
    <li> Provides light coverage, with minimal fragrance, not really visible when I mix it with a bit of moisturizer before applying, but even the skin tone nicely. P.S it has anti acne meds which somehow I missed upon checking ingredients!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m hooked. Been using this brand for months now and I haven&#x27;t gotten breakouts. Great all around coverage for Pacific Islander warm toned skin color.  I use it after I started Paula&#x27;s Choice products and it&#x27;s a match made in heaven</li>
    <li> I like BB creams because I don&#x27;t like to wear heavy makeup, and its an easy way to use moisturizer in one step in the morning. I do have slight acne, and I like that this has 2% treatment in it, but still moisturizes (the usual make up I use is only .5% and tends to dry out my face). My only complaint would be that it has a greyish tint-usually I would rather greyer than orange but his tint is pretty grey, I got medium which is normal for me but am thinking about buying a darker shade to see if that helps.</li>
    <li> I used to cake on foundation.  Then I found this stuff! Its smooth, light weight, but still offers a really perfect amount of medium coverage.  It also layers pretty well, so you can apply a thicker layer in spots without it looking gross and cakey.  The best part is there is salicylic acid in it, so its perfect for nights spent at the boyfriends house, mixed with moisturizer, its adds just enough color to lay in bed and not look run down or done up.  LOVE LOVE LOVE it.  Its def a staple.  Cant live without it.</li>
    <li> FANTASTIC MAKEUP FOR BUMPY FACES. STAYS ON FROM ABOUT 7 AM, TILL 5:30 PM. WITH A LITTLE TOUCH UP OF POWDER ONCE IN A WHILE DURING THE DAY. COLOR IS MED. AND IT WENT PERFECT WITH MY DAUGHTER&#x27;S LIGHT COLORED SKIN. SHE USES MINERAL POWDER AFTER SHE APPLYS THIS BASE AND IT HELPS THE FOUNDATION TO STAY ON LONGER. WORKS FOR BUMPS TOO. AND IT HAS SPF SUN SCREEN TO HELP WITH SUN.</li>
    <li> Very nice and thin but, I got medium and it&#x27;s way to light for me.</li>
    <li> It covers all the blemish on my face, very easy to apply. Very reasonable price.</li>
