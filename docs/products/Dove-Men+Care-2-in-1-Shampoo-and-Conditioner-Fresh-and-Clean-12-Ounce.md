      <li>I get so many compliments on how good I smell, they really did a great job on the scent.</li>
      <li>As far as shampoos go, this is arguably one of the best ones on the market for men.</li>
      <li>I welcome testing these and assure that they offer very good value and quality for the money spent.</li>

      <li>Love that scent too.</li>

      <li>So glad to find this.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love Dove products.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>And the scent sticks with you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get that many like the added fragrance, but I don&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>The shampoo is OK, it just isn&#x27;t the answer to thinning hair.</li>
      <li>I forget where I read that this shampoo was good for thinning hair - something that afflicts most men of a certain age...</li>
      <li>a shampoo, the scent is pleasant and it works well leaving my hair clean and fresh</li>
      <li>This is much cheaper but every bit as good in terms of thickening and cleaning.</li>
      <li>This shampoo really lathers up well, smells nice, and has a pretty good list of ingredients.</li>
      <li>I love the dove men&#x27;s line of products and was excited to try out their shampoo.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The smell from this shampoo way to strong.</li>
      <li>I also get that strong, supposedly \\&quot;manly\\&quot; scents are par for the course with men&#x27;s shampoos.</li>
      <li>It smells like I&#x27;m dumping a cheap bottle of cologne (can you say $3 a gallon?)</li>
      <li>This shampoo may actually have halted my hair loss, which is great.</li>
      <li>This product is menthol free.  </li>
      <li>Given the low price point, I didn&#x27;t have great expectations for this stuff</li>
      <li>I buy the whole line of Dove Men for my husband because it smells so amazing.</li>
      <li>There might be better shampoos, but this is quite good, especially for the price.</li>
      <li>Luv the scent, very nice but not too strong, doesn&#x27;t linger too long after a shower.</li>
      <li>This really doe a great job of cleaning your hair and has a very masculine smell.</li>
      <li>I was really excited</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t really live up to the advertising, but it is a nice shampoo nonetheless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>That is my contribution to clean</li>
      <li>And yes my hair feels clean too.</li>
      <li>I purchased this shampoo based on its many positive reviews.</li>
      <li>It certainly give hair more texture, but I&#x27;m unsure</li>
      <li>And the price was just right!</li>
      <li>in all, a great $4 spent.</li>
      <li>To be 53 years old and have a full scalp has been nice, but now to have my hair full of life again is quite the sweet deal.</li>
      <li>After one reads the Bottle, &amp;#34;thicker&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Fortifying&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Calcium&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Caffeine&amp;#34;, and all the rest of these reviews, one would think you would have a full head of hair after three weeks of using the shampoo.</li>
      <li>Was pleasantly surprised when it cleans well, dries to a nice shine.  </li>
      <li>Nice, masculine scent.</li>
      <li>He really likes it but wishes it would lather up a bit more.</li>
      <li>The fragrance they added is pleasant, but maybe a little strong for some.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the price just for that alone.  </li>
      <li>love the smell on my husband and it leaves his skin soft</li>
      <li>No smelly good nor foreign assistance.  </li>
      <li>It is just the right size for my shower booth, and it does what it advertises.  </li>
      <li>right?</li>
      <li>For this price, you are getting the right stuff.</li>
      <li>The scent is very slight, but pleasant.</li>
      <li>This stuff really works!</li>
      <li>It was exactly what he was looking for.  </li>
      <li>so you guessed it, I&#x27;ll be ordering more of this stuff but maybe not multiple bottles</li>
      <li>I believe it was because of pressure if it has been shipped via plane, so you have to be aware of that possibility</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>It has a \\&quot;manly\\&quot; scent and leaves my husbands hair feeling soft and clean.</li>
      <li>I am unclear on what exactly the purpose of putting this in a shampoo is, and I certainly didn&#x27;t get anything out of it.</li>
      <li>Has a thick full feel to it and looks better too!</li>
      <li>This is a newer product on what appears to be the new scent of &#x27;Fresh Awake&#x27;.  </li>
      <li>However when my hair got to a certain length it would break off, I guess at a certain point you need to moisturize or condition your hair or whatever which I didnt do, so I cant blame the shampoo.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not sure if my hair is any different, but if it does something amazing, i&#x27;ll add more to this review.  </li>
      <li>Regardless, I&#x27;m looking forward to the day when more companies realize that neutrally or naturally scented products are equally, if not more, appropriate for today&#x27;s men.</li>
      <li>Despite the name, The Dove Thickening/Fortifying Shampoo was a real let-down.  </li>
      <li>- The shampoo really did not make my hair thicker and fuller or gave the appearance of it.</li>
      <li>Moreover, the price is reasonable.</li>
      <li>I like dove products, but didn&#x27;t feel like this one really did what it was supposed too</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My husband used to buy a brand of shampoo that is no longer made and he was crushed.  If you buy in bulk like we tend to do then you know when you buy a gazillion of something that after a few years things just might not be on the super market shelves when you go looking for it again.  Well, I did a search on Amazon and ran across this shampoo so ordered it and much to my surprise he likes it better than the old brand he had been using by the other big manufacturer so you guessed it, I&#x27;ll be ordering more of this stuff but maybe not multiple bottles but then again maybe I should because it could disappear too before I blink!</li>
    <li> made me break out not worth it seems like it thined out my hair more</li>
    <li> Recently started losing my hair.  I&#x27;m not sure if hair actually becomes thing, but rather you lose it and that becomes its appearance.  Irregardless, this makes my hair a lot fuller after a shower.  I&#x27;ve been using hair growth products with minoxidil (spelt wrong), and it has been great considering I put the products in after showering and they sometimes clump my hair together.  This helps because my hair feels fuller and reduces the clumping of the hair.</li>
    <li> Good shampoo. I honestly haven&#x27;t noticed my thin hair feeling or looking any thicker, but as a shampoo it does clean my hair</li>
    <li> I like &amp; will buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband.  It was exactly what he was looking for.  I would highly recommend this product.  And the price was just right!</li>
    <li> I would have given Dove Men+Care Thickening Fortifying Shampoo a higher rating, but I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the fragrance in the shampoo. After using it just once, it made my hair thicker. I prefer shampoos that have no fragrance or just a slight fragrance that quickly goes away after using it.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this because I have thinning hair and the Nioxin I was using just wasn&#x27;t working for me. My hair was limp and greasy feeling. After I tried the Dove I couldn&#x27;t believe the results. My hair feels and looks great. Has a thick full feel to it and looks better too! Highly Recommended!</li>
    <li> It did not help with hair growth.</li>
    <li> Love Dove products. Most shampoos tend to leave my hair dull looking. Like how it cleans and gives it a little boost as well.</li>
    <li> BRING BACK THE SHAMPOO ONLY!!! At some point over the last couple of months Dove has discontinued the shampoo-only version of this product. It is now only offered in a 2-in-1 shampoo+conditioner. Terrible; they have ruined what was a great product. The conditioner leaves my hair heavy, weighted down, and slightly greasy. And the coating it leaves on my hair means that my hair product no longer works nearly as well (shout out to Mr Pompadour beeswax). After 3 years of using this shampoo and swearing by it, I threw away this new junk and am looking for a new product.</li>
    <li> I forget where I read that this shampoo was good for thinning hair - something that afflicts most men of a certain age... however, one of the active ingredients is caffeine. So, shy away from this product if you shower after 3 pm, unless you want your hair up all night.  Yes, I&#x27;m kidding. It&#x27;s shampoo. Smells great, dos the trick. Not sure if my hair is any different, but if it does something amazing, i&#x27;ll add more to this review.  4 stars for smell and suds.</li>
    <li> This product does not do what it claims. It made my hair completely unmanageable and made chunks of hair fall out&lt;br /&gt;way more than any other product I&#x27;ve tried in the past. It makes your hair fall out!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;The smell from this shampoo way to strong. Guys stay away from it!! I went back to my former product&lt;br /&gt;and the problem STOPPED!!!</li>
    <li> Given the low price point, I didn&#x27;t have great expectations for this stuff but boy was I wrong. I&#x27;ve got pretty thin hair and am thinning pretty badly on top but this made what hair I&#x27;ve got left much thicker and really improved my scalp coverage. Smells nice, washes well too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle of this shampoo.  It does what it&#x27;s supposed to, it cleans my hair and helps it look fuller.  For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t suit to my hairs. Never felt clean feeling but giving two stars because hair use to feel as they are thick.</li>
    <li> I like dove products, but didn&#x27;t feel like this one really did what it was supposed too (hair thickening). It also had a strange fragrance.</li>
    <li> TOO GREASY&lt;br /&gt;DOESN&#x27;T COMBINE WITH A CONDITIONER&lt;br /&gt;LEAVES HAIR LOOKING DIRTY RATHER THAN CLEAN&lt;br /&gt;MAKES HAIR LOOK FULL&lt;br /&gt;WOULD LIKELY WORK BETTER WITH DARK HAIR THAN LIGHT</li>
    <li> After using almost the entire bottle, it is time to write a review. After one reads the Bottle, &amp;#34;thicker&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Fortifying&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Calcium&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Caffeine&amp;#34;, and all the rest of these reviews, one would think you would have a full head of hair after three weeks of using the shampoo. I will list the pros and cons, the cons are first.&lt;br /&gt;Cons - The shampoo really did not make my hair thicker and fuller or gave the appearance of it. I need another haircut is all.&lt;br /&gt;Pros - This stuff smells great, it is gentler than my Wife&#x27;s $1 shampoos from the Dollar Store. I have noticed that there is no hair in the drain. This shampoo may actually have halted my hair loss, which is great. It lathers up very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: I will buy it again unless it goes above the $3.99, or until I get the nerve to purchase an actual &amp;#34;shampoo for thinning hair&amp;#34; that costs $25.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Luck - It is all good - People still love you - God still loves you - who cares if your hair is thin</li>
    <li> Believe me I do not believe any crap about hair thickening shampoos but I tried it out because the price was so cheap and let me just say that I was shocked at the results.  This really does make it thicker, not sure how.  It also makes your hair soft.  My friend who I loaned some to said his was soft for 3 whole days, much more than with any other shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I do notice is that you feel good after this shampoo, I used to just think it was the natural composition of the shampoo, but later read the bottle and realized that caffeine was one of the ingredients so that makes much more sense.  It does make you feel good though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After washing with this for once a week, I noticed my hair growing long and I didnt have any dandruff or itchiness.  However when my hair got to a certain length it would break off, I guess at a certain point you need to moisturize or condition your hair or whatever which I didnt do, so I cant blame the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a great $4 spent.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this shampoo either increased or had zero effect on my hair shedding problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone reading this can recommend a natural shampoo under $20 that stops or at least mitigates hair shedding, please help a brother out. Thanks! (Note: I had pretty good results with RegenePure DR and NT, but those products are too pricey, sadly.  I&#x27;m trying to lower my expenses, if you know what I mean!)</li>
    <li> I guess I&#x27;m with the majority on this one.  I started using this just 5 days ago and my hair went from dry, lifeless and wispy to full and fluffy, and silky. And yes my hair feels clean too. The scent is very slight, but pleasant. To be 53 years old and have a full scalp has been nice, but now to have my hair full of life again is quite the sweet deal. I just can&#x27;t stop running my fingers through my hair.</li>
    <li> I do not like dirty, greasy hair and finding a shampoo that satisfies that need is close to impossible.  One that works well for me is Dove Men+Care Thickening Fortifying Shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I squeeze about a nickel-sized blob of Dove into my palm and scrub it onto my wet head, rinse well and repeat.  (Sounds like a shampoo instruction book,)  Finish the rest of the body parts and get ready to go.  I comb my wet hair and do nothing else to it.  No smelly good nor foreign assistance.  That is my contribution to clean air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a simple and fast process; above all it works well beyond many of the other products.  Moreover, the price is reasonable.</li>
    <li> I have very fine, thin hair and since I&#x27;m starting to lose it I wanted to see if thickening it up would help.  (Rogaine did not BTW) If my hair is too long it has no body, this doesn&#x27;t help.  If it&#x27;s a little shorter this does give it some body.  Mostly it just makes my hair look &amp;#34;better&amp;#34;.  My wife says it makes it look darker, shinier, &amp; &amp;#34;healthier&amp;#34;.  It&#x27;s worth the price just for that alone.  If you are going to choose a shampoo, you might as well choose something that makes your hair look nicer...right?</li>
    <li> It is shampoo not much to say it is what was expected and it was packaged well and cleans just like what is in the grocery stores. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried more expensive brands, and was a loyal Redken user. This is much cheaper but every bit as good in terms of thickening and cleaning. I find this difficult to find in stores in my area, so ordering on Amazon was an extra bonus.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great stuff am I am the wife using it, it foams and feels great and also works so there</li>
    <li> Great smelling product. It certainly give hair more texture, but I&#x27;m unsure how well it&#x27;s actually thickening. That aside, it&#x27;s a great shampoo and not expensive at all.</li>
    <li> BECAUSE IT&#x27;S THIRSTY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really dries the heck out of my hair. It does a great job and smells WONDERFUL. I get so many compliments on how good I smell, they really did a great job on the scent. However, it leaves my hair mangled if I don&#x27;t use conditioner. My barber had a few words to say about how damaged my hair was from this product. Use conditioner if you buy this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t notice much of a thickening action.</li>
    <li> Used this shampoo because of the reviews. Was pleasantly surprised when it cleans well, dries to a nice shine.  I have thinning hair and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down like a lot of shampoos do.</li>
    <li> Lathers really well, leaves no residue behind, good volumizing effect</li>
    <li> This shampoo has a nice smell. You only need a small amount per wash, so it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> definitely made hair feel a little bit thicker and fuller. would recommend for sure</li>
    <li> I purchased this shampoo based on its many positive reviews. Seems to do what it&#x27;s supposed to, but the scent? Err, perhaps I should say the \\&quot;stink?\\&quot; Overwhelming to say the least. It smells like I&#x27;m dumping a cheap bottle of cologne (can you say $3 a gallon?) on my hair each and every time I use it. And the scent sticks with you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get that many like the added fragrance, but I don&#x27;t. I also get that strong, supposedly \\&quot;manly\\&quot; scents are par for the course with men&#x27;s shampoos. Regardless, I&#x27;m looking forward to the day when more companies realize that neutrally or naturally scented products are equally, if not more, appropriate for today&#x27;s men.</li>
    <li> This is a very good shampoo. It is just the right size for my shower booth, and it does what it advertises.  For this price, you are getting the right stuff.</li>
    <li> Tried it and my hair does feel thicker and fuller......I&#x27;m getting thin in front and although dove doesn&#x27;t grow new hair I had good comments on the fullness of my hair...it has good aroma also!!</li>
    <li> My hair is clean and the wife is happy.</li>
    <li> The thickening effect cannot be found, probably I have to wait for a few months to see the effect. But the price of the shampoo is very low.</li>
    <li> Great for me between Ketoconozole uses</li>
    <li> Unfortunately the bottle was burst open when it arrived, despite the box being in perfect condition! I believe it was because of pressure if it has been shipped via plane, so you have to be aware of that possibility if you buy liquids online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, we couldn&#x27;t use the shampoo but it sure smelled great! Maybe next time. :)</li>
    <li> Great shampoo, but was shocked by the price ($12) when I saw the same item at Walmart for $3.97. Enough said.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works! My hair is noticeably fuller, stronger and, thicker than it has been in years! I would recommend this to  any one struggling with thinning hair.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice men&#x27;s shampoo. It has a \\&quot;manly\\&quot; scent and leaves my husbands hair feeling soft and clean. After several days of him using it I did notice that his hair does appear to be a bit thicker. He really likes it but wishes it would lather up a bit more.</li>
    <li> Dove has made an aggresive stand in the Men products&#x27; market with a variety of good quality items in several directions: shampoos, body gels, shaing needs.&lt;br /&gt;Since the brand is not an expensive one (as Neutrogena and others are or have become) I welcome testing these and assure that they offer very good value and quality for the money spent.</li>
    <li> I have always had thin hair, good for not shaving a few days, not so good for not washing your hair. But I have to say this shampoo is great for giving my hair more body. The scent is nice but not to strong, which I like. And it works well with the other Dove for Men products as well.</li>
    <li> The fragrance they added is pleasant, but maybe a little strong for some. It is a bit on the assertive side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did a good job cleaning and lightly conditioning my hair, no better or worse on that front than other similar products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I do not understand however is the addition of the Caffeine. I am unclear on what exactly the purpose of putting this in a shampoo is, and I certainly didn&#x27;t get anything out of it.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo, along with the Dove Men soap.  I really think Dove has done an excellent job with their &#x27;for men&#x27; products.  I will continue to use this product, as it&#x27;s the best &#x27;thickening&#x27; shampoo that I&#x27;ve run across so far.  There might be better shampoos, but this is quite good, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> I mean, it&#x27;s shampoo, how bad can it be!? Luv the scent, very nice but not too strong, doesn&#x27;t linger too long after a shower. Only gripe, it&#x27;s just a 12oz bottle for about $5 or so. I alternate with the Dove Men+Care Fortifying Shampoo &amp; Conditioner w/Caffeine &amp; Menthol. That one is a 2 in 1 that is 25.4oz for the same price. Love that scent too. I think I noticed my hair a but fuller after the second use of the Thickening Shampoo. I would buy again. Amazon has the best price. Packaging left a bit to be desired (only 1 air bag, small too) but it did not leak. ~R</li>
    <li> Pros:  Nice, masculine scent. Does seem to make my husband&#x27;s hair look thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  I think my husband is sensitive to something in this shampoo as, he noticed after repeated use that his scalp was feeling very dried out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:  My husband wouldn&#x27;t use this one as he&#x27;s sensitive to something in here. Though, if it didn&#x27;t dry out his scalp he would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> This is a newer product on what appears to be the new scent of &#x27;Fresh Awake&#x27;.  It also gives Caffeine! (don&#x27;t drink it though!) and Calcium.  Caffeine is supposedly to give you an extra kick in the morning (or your hair an extra kick), and I&#x27;m assuming the Calcium is there for thickening (as this ingredient doesn&#x27;t appear in the non-thickening versions). Lots of suds, good smell.</li>
    <li> I buy the whole line of Dove Men for my husband because it smells so amazing. I like the Aqua color fragrance the best, but I have yet to smell one that I don&#x27;t like. It&#x27;s subtle, but it does last all day. Yummm</li>
    <li> I guess this is what happens when you buy something online.  I didn&#x27;t even think that it might have one of those chemically - perfumed smells, but it does.  In fact, I can&#x27;t even use it.  I opened the package, popped the lid and was literally overwhelmed.  I thought, well ... maybe it&#x27;s not so bad once you use it and rinse.  So I put it in my bathroom.  That was a few hours ago.  Unfortunately, the smell is so strong I can smell it a couple of rooms away.  It&#x27;s one of those smells that seems to stick to you.  I can&#x27;t get rid of it.  I&#x27;m not even going to try this product.  I&#x27;m going to see if I can give it to somebody who was born without an olfactory sense and see if they can get any use out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say, I am so surprised that in this day and age a big company like that would still be automatically putting perfume in it&#x27;s products.  It&#x27;s definitely turned me off to Dove products.  If you have any allergies or sensitivities to smell, you may want to pass.</li>
    <li> Good shampoo. I bought it to rotate out with my other shampoo, so that I&#x27;m not using the same product in my hair every day. This shampoo really lathers up well, smells nice, and has a pretty good list of ingredients.</li>
    <li> This Dove Thickening, Fortifying shampoo is suppose to make your hair look thicker &amp; fuller.  It doesn&#x27;t really live up to the advertising, but it is a nice shampoo nonetheless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does seem to add a touch more fullness to my man&#x27;s hair, but not a significant amount.  This Dove+ shampoo is ot worth paying extra to get so-called fortification.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is pleasant.  The shampoo is OK, it just isn&#x27;t the answer to thinning hair.</li>
    <li> giving only one star since price jumped up three fold in two months.  was $4.95 per same size bottle. Two months later almost $14. now it is a rip off. will not buy again until price goes down to one that makes sense, like $5.00 a bottle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not exaggerating when I state that I have received numerous compliments on how thick my hair is after using this.  I have never heard this in the past once.  I have no idea why it&#x27;s so effective at making hair appear thicker, but rest assured it does.  Unfortunately Target no longer sells this, nor do any of the local drug stores.  They have other versions of Dove Men + Care shampoo but not this version.  Other versions contain menthol which gives you a strange burning sensation on your head.  This product is menthol free.  Give it a try!</li>
    <li> Not sure about hair re-growth but my hair fall has definitely decreased after using this product for six months. Always order mine through Amazon as not all Walmart stores have it in stock.</li>
    <li> I love the dove men&#x27;s line of products and was excited to try out their shampoo. This really doe a great job of cleaning your hair and has a very masculine smell. I was really excited how well it works and will definetly use again. Not sure what the caffeine is for but this product does a great job.</li>
    <li> Another company stopped making their men&#x27;s daily thickening shampoo.  So glad to find this.&lt;br /&gt;: : : : : :</li>
    <li> As far as shampoos go, this is arguably one of the best ones on the market for men. Excellent lather and has a pleasant smell that doesn&#x27;t come off too strong. It even makes your hair soft and very manageable. However, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be very effective at the \\&quot;thickening\\&quot; part. If you want a regular shampoo than this product is for you. If you are looking for one to actually thicken your hair then I would recommend looking elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Despite the name, The Dove Thickening/Fortifying Shampoo was a real let-down.  It does not thicken hair folicles but rather adds fullness and body which hopefully might overcome thinning hair.  I don&#x27;t want fullness and body for the type of hairstyle that I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a shampoo, the scent is pleasant and it works well leaving my hair clean and fresh but it does not thicken the hair, it just adds fullness.  There are less expensive shampoos which will add body and fullness for less money that work just as well.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have long hair, so the whole thickening aspect of it is difficult for me to review... it didn&#x27;t seem any different than any other shampoo. That being said, it is worlds above other products simply because it lathers great and you only need a very small amount to get your hair clean. It stays clean too; so it does a good job of getting rid of the oil and dirt.  The smell is great as well, my wife likes it and I don&#x27;t mind it either.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> love the smell on my husband and it leaves his skin soft</li>
