      <li>Pantene Ice Shine Silicone Free Shampoo</li>
      <li>This is just a great, basic, no frills shampoo.</li>
      <li>Instead I use Pantene&#x27;s Aqua Light Weightless Conditioning Shake Hair Product, sold by Amazon.</li>
      <li>Tried for the first time and it really dies leave your hair extremely clean!!!</li>
      <li>It arrived quickly and as soon as I used it, I could tell a HUGE difference in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Very natural and kind to your scalp.</li>
      <li>Feel cool after shower~</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always had a very oily scalp and have never been able to go over a day without shampooing.  </li>
      <li>The first day offers a clean, light very pleasant scent but after that there isn&#x27;t much left at all.</li>
      <li>I bought this shampoo because it was a clarifying shampoo and the price was right.</li>
      <li>Also great family shampoo as it&#x27;s gentle enough to use on my young children&#x27;s hair and even the pets once in a</li>
      <li>Adds a nice highlight and shine to my grey hair.</li>
      <li>This shampoo not only has added a very nice shine, without weighing down my fairly fine hair, but it controls my oily scalp.</li>
      <li>and I appreciate the very gentle, not overpowering scent.</li>
      <li>and I was trying this brand for the first time (even though I lost almost 1/6 of the shampoo ....</li>
      <li>Pantene has been around for a long time, and it is safe to assume they know what they are doing.</li>
      <li>This is my new go-to shampoo that works well with pretty much every conditioner I&#x27;ve used it with!</li>
      <li>I bought this product because I really needed a clarifying shampoo.</li>
      <li>Really notice the shine after using this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo really works for me.</li>
      <li>At any event, I didn&#x27;t ask for refund because I really like the  fragrant of the shampoo</li>
      <li>If your hair is oily, thin, trapped under hair spray or mousse, this is an excellent shampoo to leave your hair practically \\&quot;sterilized\\&quot; it will be so clean.</li>
      <li>My hair feels clean without feeling dry and stripped and it lathers well</li>
      <li>gave it four stars because I personally would like a little more fragrance.</li>
      <li>My husband uses this and his hair is always soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It feels soft and looks shiner</li>
      <li>There isn&#x27;t a ton of extra softening agents or additives to make your hair anything other than clean.</li>
      <li>The quantity is to large for a single person use.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo, or an earlier version of it, for over 10 years, and each hairdresser that cuts my hair comments at what &amp;#34;wonderful condition&amp;#34; my hair is in.  As a natural blonde with very fine hair that has to be washed every day, this is a perfect match for me!</li>
    <li> As always, Pantene is tops.</li>
    <li> Tried for the first time and it really dies leave your hair extremely clean!!!</li>
    <li> Feel cool after shower~</li>
    <li> My favorite shampoo!  Adds a nice highlight and shine to my grey hair.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite shampoo! It leaves my hair silky and clean! It has no silicone! Very natural and kind to your scalp. Leaves hair shiny and clean!</li>
    <li> This shampoo really works for me. I&#x27;ve always had a very oily scalp and have never been able to go over a day without shampooing.  This shampoo not only has added a very nice shine, without weighing down my fairly fine hair, but it controls my oily scalp. I can now go a couple of days between shampooing.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it four stars because I personally would like a little more fragrance. The first day offers a clean, light very pleasant scent but after that there isn&#x27;t much left at all. It might be my body chemistry and may very well be perfect for others.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth a try if you have oily hair/scalp.</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful.  It cleans my hair without stripping it to fly away status, ond makes the silver shine like a halo.  Love it!!</li>

    <li> Pantene is the best all the way. love this shampoo, gave a nice vibrant shine to my hair, wouldn&#x27;t trade pantene for any luxury hair brand.</li>
    <li> Really notice the shine after using this shampoo.  I will purchase this again when I run out.  Hope this product is always available.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I really needed a clarifying shampoo. I get frizzy hair and tend to use silicon products on them (like Frizz-Ease and other serums), but I was getting to a point where I could tell that those products were building up on my hair and scalp. My hair just started feeling different, was flat, and had little shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I bought this shampoo because it was a clarifying shampoo and the price was right. It arrived quickly and as soon as I used it, I could tell a HUGE difference in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will always keep a bottle of this around. I don&#x27;t use it every day. Rather, I use it once a week or so, to clarify my hair and get rid of the products. I always hear about more expensive clarifying shampoos, like B&amp;B&#x27;s Sunday Funday. But this one works well and is so much less expensive, I&#x27;ll stick with this!</li>
    <li> Decent stuff, less buildup than regular shampoo. Smells nice. Unfortunately, I found out after I placed my order, Pantene tests on animals so 2 stars.</li>
    <li> I love lantern it is all I have used for years and is the only shampoo I will use.</li>
    <li> Although it cleaned well, it didn&#x27;t leave my hair as shiny as some of the other Pantene shampoos I&#x27;ve used. It would be good to use maybe once or twice a month as a clarifier.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this and his hair is always soft and shiny. Never has an ichy scalp. I would recommend this to others</li>
    <li> Cleans without coloring agents.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to strip hair, my curls are not as frizzy as before. Would recommend for dry hair.</li>
    <li> There are better products manufactures by this company. The quantity is to large for a single person use. I do not like this.</li>
    <li> When I could no longer find this at my local low-cost department store, I was bummed, but figured I would check Amazon just in case, and once again Amazon came through!  Now I can have silky super shiny hair again!</li>
    <li> Just as advertised, this well priced Pantene Ice Shine Silicone Free Shampoo 12.6 Fl Oz (packaging may vary), delivers a good quality shampoo which the lady of the house seems to enjoy according to her opinion. Pantene has been around for a long time, and it is safe to assume they know what they are doing. 4 Stars.</li>
    <li> If your hair is oily, thin, trapped under hair spray or mousse, this is an excellent shampoo to leave your hair practically \\&quot;sterilized\\&quot; it will be so clean. I don&#x27;t use the matching conditioner. Instead I use Pantene&#x27;s Aqua Light Weightless Conditioning Shake Hair Product, sold by Amazon. Pantene has many very good hair products.</li>
    <li> I love Pantene products and this is no exception.  The shampoo cleans my hair without leaving an unwanted film on it, in spite of the hard watar in this area.</li>
    <li> Pantene Ice Shine Silicone Free Shampoo&lt;br /&gt;This is a wonderful shampoo&lt;br /&gt;My hair looks and feels healthier.&lt;br /&gt;It feels soft and looks shiner</li>
