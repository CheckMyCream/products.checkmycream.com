    <li> Great bottles for essential oil roll-ons, sturdy and as expected.</li>
    <li> Great size and came packaged great!</li>
    <li> the bottles are a great deal, but the roller ball isn&#x27;t as nice as other bottles i have seen... i feel it doesn&#x27;t dispense enough (I put thieves, tea tree, oregano, and coconut oil and make an immunity blend) and i have to roll A LOT to get a little oil out</li>
    <li> Awesome bottles of great quality. Rollers work well and I have had no issues with leaking. Two broke in transit but still worth the money.</li>
    <li> Love these roller bottles!!! Perfect for putting oils on the bottom of your feet!! Will purchase these againðŸ˜Š</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for to use with my essential oils . The price was right and speedy shipping .</li>
    <li> I sell Essential Oils, and make items to sell with them. These worked perfectly for the bug bite relief and individual roller bottles of oils. Fast shipping, even had in time for my big show when other websites would not have!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and easy to use, these roller bottles are perfect for mixing oils with FCO.  I have ordered them twice now.</li>
    <li> Most of the roller ball inserts don&#x27;t fit into the bottles. I have bottles like this from other sellers and the roller ball tops are MUCH EASIER to put on.</li>

    <li> These are easy to fill and glide on smooth</li>
    <li> While these are the perfect size for my needs I&#x27;m VERY disappointed as more than half of them do not work.  The roller balls do not rotate or glide.  Will not be purchasing them again and I can&#x27;t return them as I e used them and they are not in original condition so it was a complete waste of money!</li>
    <li> Not bad for the price. Only had one that leaked a little but it may have been the user not the bottle. Will buy again for sure :)</li>
    <li> I use them for essential oil blends and haven&#x27;t seen an issue yet</li>
    <li> What I hoped for! No leaks, perfect size for oils.</li>

    <li> I like these a lot and they are a very good price.  I have used several and so far all are working great. I use them as a way to apply diluted essential oils.

    <li> Perfect for my essential oils! Great value</li>
