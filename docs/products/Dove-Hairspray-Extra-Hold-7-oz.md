      <li>The product itself is fantastic!</li>
      <li>I love this hairspray.  </li>
      <li>Great deal money wise - 3 bottles for $19 and a little change.  </li>
      <li>I love the clean smell of it.</li>
      <li>and yet it is fairly easy to comb out.  </li>
      <li>As to the vendor, the product arrived ahead of schedule, package fine.  </li>
      <li>So this not only smells great</li>
      <li>My mom originally had bought this stuff and used it herself.</li>
      <li>The spray also smells good in comparison to a lot of other sprays.  </li>
      <li>I tried contacting the company, and they say the stores aren&#x27;t handling it right.</li>
      <li>Does not weigh my hair down and leaves it smelling good.</li>
      <li>And a great price I will definitely be ordering this again in the future</li>
      <li>It provides a strong but soft  hold that stands up to humidity.  </li>
      <li>if I sound like a commercial, well, it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
      <li>Always tells me my hair smells pretty.)</li>
      <li>I have been looking for a reasonably priced flxie hair spray for years now!</li>
      <li>I just hope Dove doesn&#x27;t stop making it because it never fails, whenever I find something I like, it gets discontinued.</li>
      <li>This is good everyday hairspray.  </li>
      <li>It has good hold without being heavy on your hair.  </li>
      <li>I was very please with this product.</li>
      <li>So, if you are not into fancy sprays and just want the job done for a reasonable price, than this is the product and vendor for you</li>
      <li>I often style my hair with much volume and teasing.  </li>
      <li>I love this hairspray because it doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky film on my hair that other hairsprays do.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for years and will continue to do so as long as it&#x27;s available.  </li>
      <li>I have tried a lot of other brands and the only one I liked as well</li>
      <li>It holds for around 10 hours in normal temperatures and that time decreases when the temp goes up.</li>
      <li>Very light and not overwhelming.</li>
      <li>You get the hold of the style yet your hair still feels soft.  </li>
      <li>This is a must buy if you like your hair to keep its style, but still want it to feel natural and soft.  </li>
      <li>Not strong enough but still fine</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many others, hoping to find one that smells as good, but they must all be doing away with scented hairspray because they were either unscented or smelled horrible.</li>
      <li>and they said they were sorry but had only good comments.  </li>
      <li>Product is great as usual, but it is always shipped loose inside the package, and the tops are all broken off.  </li>
      <li>This product makes my hair look fresh the whole day through without being hard or wearing out half way through the day.</li>
      <li>and maybe a little more was a Redken product that cost at least $12 a can.  </li>

<li> I have very thin, fine hair</li>
<li> I have half a bottle of this dove left from before i switched</li>
<li> but 2 of my 4 bottles recently started to develop a problem where it leaks from the spray head causing a sticky mess.</li>
<li> The only woes i have about this stuff is that its number 1 content is alcohol, which is not friendly to my hair&#x27;s health.</li>
<li> This was not what I expected when it arrived.</li>
<li> Its not a very runny product applying it</li>
<li> i was missing, it also added extra frizz</li>
<li> A little goes a long way and it doesn&#x27;t leave sticky residue on my bathroom mirrors and counters.  </li>
<li> so it doesn&#x27;t clash with my other scents.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve checked out other sites and</li>
<li> I like the way it makes my hair feel--keeps it in place with minimal &amp;#34;crunch&amp;#34;!</li>
<li> so I have to be careful with the products I use that they aren&#x27;t going to weigh my style down.  </li>
<li> If anyone is naive enough to buy into this comment, it&#x27;s a shame.  </li>
<li> Previously, I had received THREE bottles for this price.</li>
<li> Every little bit helps.  </li>
<li> After boiling the sprayer head I don&#x27;t run into the problem for a few weeks</li>
<li> During the day I also received a few comments about the smell.  </li>
<li> full can because after I&#x27;ve used it a few times, the spray starts coming out around the base of the nozzle and runs down over my hand.</li>
<li> I used a small amount out of one and decided it was not for my hair.</li>
<li> I am not sure what is causing it as the bottle has never been dropped.</li>
<li> Not sure why this happened.</li>
<li> most of them comment on the terrible smell.  </li>
<li> (I have very thick hair)</li>
<li> this stuff isn&#x27;t overly expensive.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, It has become difficult to find in my area.  </li>
<li> I was afraid this would be sticky because it isn&#x27;t aerosol.  </li>
<li> When I titled this review stinks, I mean it literally, It STINKS!!!  </li>
<li> but one bad hair day I decided to give this a try</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Product arrived super fast 5/2 - great service!  I love this hairspray.  It smells good (my husband thinks so. Always tells me my hair smells pretty.) It feels nice and holds without looking like a helmet and it helps fight frizz and I don&#x27;t believe they make this claim.  Every little bit helps.  Great deal money wise - 3 bottles for $19 and a little change.  Nice size bottles too.</li>
    <li> better price than in stores for a product I love!</li>
    <li> I like the hold it gives me and yet it is fairly easy to comb out.  I have tried a lot of other brands and the only one I liked as well and maybe a little more was a Redken product that cost at least $12 a can.  Two out of three of the cans the sprayer quit working.  So I feel that the Dove is a good product for a much better price.</li>
    <li> Love this brand of hair spray.  The discontinued it for a while but brought it back.</li>
    <li> Not strong enough but still fine</li>
    <li> For what ever reason my hair did not like to stay combed. I tried this product, just as a \\&quot;let me see if it works\\&quot;  and discovered it does. I dont have to use alot to get my hair to stay where it belongs.  As to the vendor, the product arrived ahead of schedule, package fine.  So, if you are not into fancy sprays and just want the job done for a reasonable price, than this is the product and vendor for you</li>
    <li> This is good everyday hairspray.  I wear my hair up for work.  It helps prevent fly aways for the better part of the day... of course, I&#x27;m putting on and taking off a hat or helmet multiplle times per day.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way and it doesn&#x27;t leave sticky residue on my bathroom mirrors and counters.  It has good hold without being heavy on your hair.  No scent so it doesn&#x27;t clash with my other scents.</li>
    <li> Holds really well without all that sticky mess! And it doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg. . . if I sound like a commercial, well, it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> This works well as a setting spray with my curling iron.  Gives my hair body and shine that lasts all day.  LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> Works great even in humidity! I have very thin fine hair and it does not get sticky and will hold all day.</li>
    <li> Works well. Very light and not overwhelming. Both of my sisters wanted a bottle too after using it.</li>
    <li> Got it fast, no build up, great hold and smells good. Dove is awesome.</li>
    <li> My mom originally had bought this stuff and used it herself. Id never been one for hairspray. I never did my hair in ways that i needed it to hold the shape and i sometimes worried it would make my hair crunchy. but one bad hair day I decided to give this a try and i was highly impressed. i started using it more and more and then had to get my own bottle! and that was ok bc this stuff isn&#x27;t overly expensive. Its not overly fragrant either. The only woes i have about this stuff is that its number 1 content is alcohol, which is not friendly to my hair&#x27;s health. So while it did add extra shape i didn&#x27;t know i was missing, it also added extra frizz i didn&#x27;t know i could prevent. so i switched to pantene&#x27;s curl enhancing hairspray bc its made with water instead. works just as well. I have half a bottle of this dove left from before i switched and i still use it as back up.</li>
    <li> I have very thin, fine hair so I have to be careful with the products I use that they aren&#x27;t going to weigh my style down.  I often style my hair with much volume and teasing.  This product is SO great because it&#x27;s a balance between &amp;#34;flexible&amp;#34; hairspray and &amp;#34;maximum hold.&amp;#34;  I&#x27;ve used this product for years and will continue to do so as long as it&#x27;s available.  Dove company makes excellent hair care products that are just as great as any salon brand!</li>
    <li> It was not what I wanted. I ordered the aerosol spray but you sent the non aerodol</li>
    <li> I was afraid this would be sticky because it isn&#x27;t aerosol.  It works just as well as any aerosol spray.</li>
    <li> This was not what I expected when it arrived. I used a small amount out of one and decided it was not for my hair. I thought I was ordering the regular hairspray. I am not at all used to that with Amazon. I probably should have returned it but did not want to go through the hassle. I will have to say this is my first of not being satisified with a product that I ordered in the past.</li>
    <li> This is the only hairspray I use! I like the way it makes my hair feel--keeps it in place with minimal &amp;#34;crunch&amp;#34;! (I have very thick hair)</li>
    <li> I love this hairspray because it doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky film on my hair that other hairsprays do.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky, helmet head feeling. I like it.</li>
    <li> Best hair spray ever!!!! I have been looking for a reasonably priced flxie hair spray for years now! I tried tresemme, suave, aqua net, ausse, gardnier,rusk... None of them had a flexible hold. This product makes my hair look fresh the whole day through without being hard or wearing out half way through the day. Absolutely love this product and will not use anything else!!</li>
    <li> Smells nice but leaves hair sticky.  Also it irritates my scalp.  Will not purchase again</li>
    <li> Product is great as usual, but it is always shipped loose inside the package, and the tops are all broken off.  Sometime there is product sprayed inside while in route.</li>
    <li> I actually love this hairspray because it doesn&#x27;t build up on my hair. BUT, I have just thrown away the 4th full can because after I&#x27;ve used it a few times, the spray starts coming out around the base of the nozzle and runs down over my hand. I tried contacting the company, and they say the stores aren&#x27;t handling it right. I&#x27;ve purchased from two different places and the same thing happens. Anyone else have the problem?</li>
    <li> Always use this product. I love it</li>
    <li> Been using this hairspray for quite some time now.  Love it.  You get the hold of the style yet your hair still feels soft.  The spray also smells good in comparison to a lot of other sprays.  This is a must buy if you like your hair to keep its style, but still want it to feel natural and soft.  No helmet head with this one.  Buy it!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Dove non-aerosol hair spray ever since it hit the market and was so pleased with it.  Then, it disappeared for a while and came back, IMPROVED, yeah, like that happened.  They just found a cheaper way to make it and make bigger profits.  When I titled this review stinks, I mean it literally, It STINKS!!!  I used it once and all I could smell all day was the stinky spray.  I couldn&#x27;t wait to get it washed out.  During the day I also received a few comments about the smell.  I spend money on perfume to smell like my perfume not this chemically smelling spray.  A while back I called Unilever about the smell and they said they were sorry but had only good comments.  If anyone is naive enough to buy into this comment, it&#x27;s a shame.  I&#x27;ve checked out other sites and most of them comment on the terrible smell.  Anyway, if any of you feel as I do, please call Unilever and complain.  Their number is on the botle.  It&#x27;s our only hope to force these big companies to quit \\&quot;improving\\&quot; their products.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have ever used to liven up my wrought iron candle holders.  I never use it on my hair.  I use gel for that.</li>
    <li> product as described. Received on time.</li>
    <li> I was very please with this product. It was well packaged. And a great price I will definitely be ordering this again in the future</li>
    <li> I love this hairspray. Unfortunately, It has become difficult to find in my area.  It provides a strong but soft  hold that stands up to humidity.  Thanks to amazon for providing it at a great price!</li>
    <li> Very light hairspray. Does not weigh my hair down and leaves it smelling good. Washes out nicely.</li>
    <li> The product itself is fantastic! It holds for around 10 hours in normal temperatures and that time decreases when the temp goes up. Its not a very runny product applying it but 2 of my 4 bottles recently started to develop a problem where it leaks from the spray head causing a sticky mess. I am not sure what is causing it as the bottle has never been dropped. I did find a temp fix, once this starts happening just take the sprayer head out and put it in some boiling water for about 5 minutes. My guess is that the solution is causing something to clog somewhere and the solution has to find somewhere else to go. After boiling the sprayer head I don&#x27;t run into the problem for a few weeks but then it starts back up. Shame because the product it self is actually nice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad you carry this Dove Hairspray. I used to get it at Wal Mart but they no longer carry it. I love the clean smell of it. I&#x27;ve tried many others, hoping to find one that smells as good, but they must all be doing away with scented hairspray because they were either unscented or smelled horrible. So this not only smells great but it&#x27;s also the perfect hold. I just hope Dove doesn&#x27;t stop making it because it never fails, whenever I find something I like, it gets discontinued.</li>
    <li> I love the product but I was charged almost $15.00 for ONE bottle!  Not sure why this happened. Previously, I had received THREE bottles for this price. Now the product is out of stock. Guess I will get this elsewhere.</li>
