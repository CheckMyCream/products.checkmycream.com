      <li>The lipgloss is perfect, too.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve got very fair skin</li>

      <li>Great buy.</li>
      <li>Color looks great on whoever wears is, and you can see the difference.</li>
      <li>This Lip gloss works great.</li>
      <li>Looks great.</li>
      <li>Great coverage</li>
      <li>It has a nice, skin-soothing consistency and the perfect \\&quot;natural\\&quot;</li>
      <li>Would love more color options!!!</li>
      <li>with the price and the excellent quick shipping provided with the purchase.</li>
      <li>My skin is unusually fair but has a good texture and is one of my better features.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used a bunch of times and I love it!  </li>
      <li>and I love it!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I love this gloss !  </li>
      <li>I love this!</li>
      <li>The gloss actually kind of changes color, depending on skin tone.</li>
      <li>This color is good for more of an evening look.</li>
      <li>Nice, moist &amp; glossy...not sticky or drying.  </li>
      <li>This product is ok.  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite lip gloss ever.</li>
      <li>Love the idea.  </li>
      <li>Its got a nice light on it</li>
      <li>Love this .</li>
      <li>I love this Physicians Formula lip gloss.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been startled to receive many compliments on my lip color.</li>
      <li>I loved it the first purchase and now I found it and was very&lt;</li>
      <li>LOVE the light and mirror too.</li>
      <li>Good looks may not be way up there on my list of values and priorities, but I still enjoy looking pretty and chic, and I tend to take some care with my appearance.</li>
      <li>It really does turn into the perfect color after going on clear.  </li>
      <li>I first discover this amazing lip gloss at a pharmaprix in montreal after that i can&#x27;t stop buying it</li>
      <li>I freaked when walmart stopped carrying it, pretty sure I literally thanked god when I found this seller.  : )</li>
      <li>The mirror on it&#x27;s side and the LED light it contains really comes in handy in last-minute situations.</li>
      <li>This marginally improved my choice of lip colors, but a truly appropriate and complimentary shade still eluded me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Physicians</li>
      <li>Just do not apply chapstick or anything else before applying this, as it will greatly affect your final color.</li>
      <li>but if you can get either free or on sale I wouldn&#x27;t it for the price that they are selling it at.</li>
      <li>It was available from Sephora, but for about triple the price of this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>you decide to give this lip gloss a try, you are at high risk of loving it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not afraid of color, but I guess I didn&#x27;t expect the fuchsia that it turned out to be on me!</li>
      <li>much cheaper than the products at the health food store- but same good ingredients and no yuckky smell/taste!</li>
      <li>This is the best lipgloss but really hard to find at ulta.</li>
      <li>These days I rarely buy make-up at upscale department stores, having found that I can save hugely by scouting out acceptable equivalents at the drugstore or discount store.</li>
      <li>I am always getting compliments on how full and luscious my lips look.</li>
      <li>It turns color fast and I love the color.</li>
      <li>so you can see to put it on when its kind of dark out or even when its daylight and you want to make sure to put a light coating on.  </li>
      <li>I have to dot it then rub it in quickly.</li>
      <li>This is a pretty color, and everyone oohs and ahhs over the light and mirror on it.</li>
      <li>I have never been happy with any of the 9.5 zillion lipstick colors (slight exaggeration)</li>
      <li>has a useful light  that I use as a flashlight while in the club looking for something in my purse and as well a very convenient attached mirror</li>
      <li>Moreover, when I check out my mouth in a mirror after four or five hours, it still looks fresh -- no need to reapply.</li>
      <li>(I have very fair and light skin, my mother has tan skin, and two of my cousins have dark skin) and the lip gloss always turns a different color on them than on me.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s right</li>
      <li>Even for a quick trip to the corner store, when I skip most of the drill (foundation, eyeliner, etc.), I will usually smooth my favorite moisturizer over my face and dab on some Physicians Formula pH Powered Lip Gloss -- always in Pink, since the Light Pink shade doesn&#x27;t quite work for me.</li>
      <li>It lasts a long time, and the shine is amazing.</li>
      <li>And the packaging is nice too as it has a little light on the brush.</li>
      <li>Good color, shipped fast and was what I expected.</li>
      <li>Long lasting color looks great on my lips.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Since I first started wearing make-up regularly, around age 14 or 15, I have hunted in vain for a lipstick I could love and rely on.</li>
      <li>Color is pretty .</li>
      <li>Even when it wears off it leaves this nice pink tint to the lips.</li>
      <li>I hope you will keep selling this as long as it is available!</li>
      <li>Love this as I cannot wear regular lipsticks as I grow older.</li>
      <li>Not sticky and really does what it says.</li>
      <li>I think light pink would be good for everyday use.</li>
      <li>Oh and thanks amazon bc</li>
      <li>There really should be an apostrophe either before or after \\&quot;Physicians\\&quot; in \\&quot;Physicians Formula.\\</li>
      <li>believe there are similar products available in the high-end market.</li>
      <li>Fast service.</li>
      <li>It goes on transparent and changes color fast.  </li>
      <li>Make sure you don&#x27;t put too thick of a coat on it because otherwise it will be too dark or too bright on your lips.  </li>
      <li>This product extremely exceeded my expectations and I love it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for a dramatic look.</li>
      <li>I did learn that I was a \\&quot;Winter\\&quot; and needed to seek out cool blue undertones in both clothing and make-up.</li>
      <li>First it has a light that illuminates down the stick so you can see as you apply.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to get it in light pink.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t give it only one star simply because it does feel like a nice lip gloss, is shiny, and seems long-lasting (which is a shame as I&#x27;d like my normal lip color back!!).  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad amazon has it because is not easy to find in the US drugstores..</li>
      <li>My one caveat: You may want to make an initial investment in two or even all three of the shades offered, since Light Pink or Natural may suit you better than Pink.</li>
      <li>it went on clear and</li>
      <li>the color is clear and the gloss is not sticky-</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d go with the light pink next time.  </li>
      <li>I thought the whole pH deal was just to catch the consumer&#x27;s interest, but it is definitely no lie!</li>
      <li>I no longer buy any other lipstick or lip gloss, since this one is right for every occasion and every variation in ambient lighting.</li>
      <li>I already had it in a light pink, and I wanted a darker pink to go over darker colors.  </li>
      <li>so it makes it hard to apply lightly which you kinda need to do because it turns fushia.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t regret wasting some money on the Light Pink before I settled on Pink, since I am now saving huge amounts of money on endless trials of other shades from other manufacturers, none of which worked for me.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> That&#x27;s right: I&#x27;m a 65-year-old semi-retiree and free-lance writer working from home. Good looks may not be way up there on my list of values and priorities, but I still enjoy looking pretty and chic, and I tend to take some care with my appearance. Even for a quick trip to the corner store, when I skip most of the drill (foundation, eyeliner, etc.), I will usually smooth my favorite moisturizer over my face and dab on some Physicians Formula pH Powered Lip Gloss -- always in Pink, since the Light Pink shade doesn&#x27;t quite work for me. I&#x27;ve been startled to receive many compliments on my lip color. I wear the gloss alone and find that I get the perfect skin-complementing color that way. I no longer buy any other lipstick or lip gloss, since this one is right for every occasion and every variation in ambient lighting. It has a nice, skin-soothing consistency and the perfect \\&quot;natural\\&quot; look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been ordering the Physicians Formula gloss at Amazon ever since my local CVS stopped carrying it, at least in my shade. Please understand that I am a tough customer and a rigorous critic: of consumer-products in general, and cosmetics in particular. These days I rarely buy make-up at upscale department stores, having found that I can save hugely by scouting out acceptable equivalents at the drugstore or discount store. At heart I am a minimalist; the relatively few other categories of discretionary-income purchases I do make repeatedly include books, DIY necessities, and basic art supplies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I first started wearing make-up regularly, around age 14 or 15, I have hunted in vain for a lipstick I could love and rely on. My skin is unusually fair but has a good texture and is one of my better features. I have never been happy with any of the 9.5 zillion lipstick colors (slight exaggeration) I have gone through over the past five decades. During the \\&quot;Color Me Beautiful\\&quot; era I did learn that I was a \\&quot;Winter\\&quot; and needed to seek out cool blue undertones in both clothing and make-up. This marginally improved my choice of lip colors, but a truly appropriate and complimentary shade still eluded me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Physicians Formula pH Powered Lip Gloss freed me from ever having to select a lip color again, only to be repeatedly disappointed and dissatisfied. It always looks perfect. Moreover, when I check out my mouth in a mirror after four or five hours, it still looks fresh -- no need to reapply. I do not understand the chemistry of the stuff, but there is no question that it adapts to your individual coloring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe there are similar products available in the high-end market. In fact, I just saw a recommendation for one such lip gloss in a magazine. It was available from Sephora, but for about triple the price of this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you decide to give this lip gloss a try, you are at high risk of loving it. My one caveat: You may want to make an initial investment in two or even all three of the shades offered, since Light Pink or Natural may suit you better than Pink. I can&#x27;t regret wasting some money on the Light Pink before I settled on Pink, since I am now saving huge amounts of money on endless trials of other shades from other manufacturers, none of which worked for me. I can not praise Physicians Formula highly enough: In the relatively small and frivolous arena of cosmetics, it is a breakthrough -- a revelation -- an epiphany.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, the only room for improvement here is in the company name. There really should be an apostrophe either before or after \\&quot;Physicians\\&quot; in \\&quot;Physicians Formula.\\&quot; Alas, this omission has become ubiquitous -- the apostrophe is either vanishing or long gone from company names throughout the English-speaking world. (Yes, I know, it may be surprising, but even some of us natural-born pedants and punctuation nerds do not feel dressed without our lip gloss!)</li>
    <li> I love this! It really does turn into the perfect color after going on clear.  I get the perfect color for ME every time!  I am very impressed with every Physician&#x27;s Formula product that I have tried.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find this lipstick at the local Rite Aid Physicians Formula display. No lipsticks on the display at all.&lt;br /&gt;I had purchased the lipstick before and wanted to purchase it again and was very disappointed when they&lt;br /&gt;didn&#x27;t have any lipstick at all in the display. I loved it the first purchase and now I found it and was very&lt;br /&gt;happy with the price and the excellent quick shipping provided with the purchase. I might just buy another&lt;br /&gt;llipstick so I won&#x27;t run out!!! I am very happy!!!!</li>
    <li> Love this . Long lasting color looks great on my lips. Love this as I cannot wear regular lipsticks as I grow older.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lip gloss ever. I freaked when walmart stopped carrying it, pretty sure I literally thanked god when I found this seller.  : )</li>
    <li> This Lip gloss works great. Even when it wears off it leaves this nice pink tint to the lips. And the packaging is nice too as it has a little light on the brush.</li>
    <li> Good color, shipped fast and was what I expected. A bit shiny for my taste but I just blot some of it off.</li>
    <li> Careful not to over do it...it really is PINK.  Nice, moist &amp; glossy...not sticky or drying.  Would love more color options!!!</li>
    <li> I look like a clown with this on...although the product did what it says- it went on clear and then...PINK.  I didn&#x27;t give it only one star simply because it does feel like a nice lip gloss, is shiny, and seems long-lasting (which is a shame as I&#x27;d like my normal lip color back!!).  I&#x27;m not afraid of color, but I guess I didn&#x27;t expect the fuchsia that it turned out to be on me!</li>
    <li> This is the best lipgloss but really hard to find at ulta.It is always sold out . I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I first discover this amazing lip gloss at a pharmaprix in montreal after that i can&#x27;t stop buying it I&#x27;m so glad amazon has it because is not easy to find in the US drugstores.. I been using this gloss for almost 2 years..has a useful light  that I use as a flashlight while in the club looking for something in my purse and as well a very convenient attached mirror</li>
    <li> This product is ok.  It goes on transparent and changes color fast.  It&#x27;s thick so it makes it hard to apply lightly which you kinda need to do because it turns fushia.  I have to dot it then rub it in quickly. I&#x27;d go with the light pink next time.  It&#x27;s great for a dramatic look.</li>
    <li> All lip gloss should be ph changing. Color looks great on whoever wears is, and you can see the difference. LOVE the light and mirror too. Would buy this again!</li>
    <li> I love this gloss !  Color is pretty . For me, I apply over lipstick.</li>
    <li> much cheaper than the products at the health food store- but same good ingredients and no yuckky smell/taste! the color is clear and the gloss is not sticky- i wear it all year round</li>
    <li> I love this Physicians Formula lip gloss. Not sticky and really does what it says. I am always getting compliments on how full and luscious my lips look. Perfect summer color. The thing is, it is hard to find in stores and triple the price of what this this vendor here sells it for. I am very happy. Fast service. Received my product in under a week. Thank you Texas Lady&#x27;s Treasures. I hope you will keep selling this as long as it is available!</li>
    <li> Love the idea.  I already had it in a light pink, and I wanted a darker pink to go over darker colors.  I use long lasting lip stains, and they need a little shine over them.  This is a pretty color, and everyone oohs and ahhs over the light and mirror on it.</li>
    <li> I bought this at walmart at a similar price and I love it! Looks great. Just do not apply chapstick or anything else before applying this, as it will greatly affect your final color. Oh and thanks amazon bc I can read reviews before buying here or in any store. I&#x27;m always the only one searching products here while standing in store aisles!</li>
    <li> I got this from a product giveaway through Physicians Formula&#x27;s facebook page.  I&#x27;ve used a bunch of times and I love it!  Its got a nice light on it so you can see to put it on when its kind of dark out or even when its daylight and you want to make sure to put a light coating on.  Make sure you don&#x27;t put too thick of a coat on it because otherwise it will be too dark or too bright on your lips.  I&#x27;ve got very fair skin so putting it on too thickly or too much makes my lips look like mood lipstick (it was big in the 80s) which I&#x27;ve already used before.  Great coverage but if you can get either free or on sale I wouldn&#x27;t it for the price that they are selling it at.</li>
    <li> Love it! First it has a light that illuminates down the stick so you can see as you apply. It has a mirror on the side of the bottle to use while you apply it. It turns color fast and I love the color. I&#x27;m going to get it in light pink. This color is good for more of an evening look. I think light pink would be good for everyday use.</li>
    <li> I use this whenever I go out since I&#x27;ve gotten it. Usually, when I&#x27;m in a rush to a dinner date or evening event. The mirror on it&#x27;s side and the LED light it contains really comes in handy in last-minute situations. The lipgloss is perfect, too. I thought the whole pH deal was just to catch the consumer&#x27;s interest, but it is definitely no lie! The gloss actually kind of changes color, depending on skin tone. I&#x27;ve let my mother and cousins try this (I have very fair and light skin, my mother has tan skin, and two of my cousins have dark skin) and the lip gloss always turns a different color on them than on me. This product extremely exceeded my expectations and I love it. Great buy.</li>
    <li> Awesome color. It lasts a long time, and the shine is amazing. Do not use a chap stick or anything before applying.</li>
