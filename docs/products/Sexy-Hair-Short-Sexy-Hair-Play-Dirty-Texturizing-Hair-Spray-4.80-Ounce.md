      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>Love this product!!</li>
      <li>I love this product because it&#x27;s lightweight and works awesome with Piece Out.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff!  </li>
      <li>this is my favorite wax!</li>
      <li>love love love it!!</li>
      <li>It makes it easy to get a good up do without a lot of teasing and makes it easy to remold my hair as the day progresses.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>Some products out there work better.</li>
      <li>Just wish it had more hold because I have to finish with a hairspray.</li>
      <li>So much better than gel or wax</li>
      <li>(At a salon I had to pay more than 50% more).</li>
      <li>Love, love, love  this product.</li>
      <li>However this one is pretty good.</li>
      <li>works like a light hold wax but better.</li>
      <li>Smell is strong but holds well.</li>
      <li>I was really excited to get a spray wax.</li>
      <li>So happy I found this discontinued product at such a reasonable price!</li>
      <li>This is my absolute favorite hair product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried it many different ways</li>
      <li>The kms hairplay  dry wax has a better hold and don&#x27;t need to follow up with hairspray...</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need to spray much as it really holds...</li>
      <li>I use this on my hair everyday,couldn&#x27;t live without it!</li>
      <li>It provides texture and body to my fine, stick straight hair without weighing it down.</li>
      <li>Texturizing spray has a wonderful scent and really helps my thin limp hair.</li>
      <li>it does what I want, but easily feels heavy if overdone.</li>
      <li>so this product is great for adding texture and a bit of volume without having to go crazy teasing your hair.</li>
      <li>holds hair softly without stickyness.</li>
      <li>Love it - does not weigh down my fine, thin hair.</li>
      <li>I cannot recommend it for a second-day &#x27;do because it just adds too much weight (for thin, fine hair like mine, anyway).</li>
      <li>have thin fine short hair..</li>

<li> A little goes a long way - hopefully Amazon will have it for a while</li>

<li> When used sparingly (and I mean SPARINGLY)</li>
<li> Was so sad to learn the company isn&#x27;t making anymore</li>

    <li> Love, love, love  this product.</li>
    <li> Smell is strong but holds well.</li>
    <li> This is my absolute favorite hair product. It provides texture and body to my fine, stick straight hair without weighing it down. It&#x27;s the ONLY thing that works for me.</li>
    <li> Helps my short, thin, fine hair keep volume ALL day long~!  You don&#x27;t need to spray much as it really holds... Don&#x27;t ever stop carrying this product~</li>
    <li> A waxy type product that helps you &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34; your hair in any fashion, and it stays put without looking &amp;#34;sprayed&amp;#34;.  Love this product!!</li>
    <li> holds hair softly without stickyness.</li>
    <li> I use this on my hair everyday,couldn&#x27;t live without it! You can use this if you only want a slight hold on your hair. Great product.</li>
    <li> this is my favorite wax! i have a short fauxhawk and its the only thing that keeps my hair in place but still moveable! love love love it!!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  So much better than gel or wax you have to dip your fingers in.</li>
    <li> I love this product because it&#x27;s lightweight and works awesome with Piece Out. It makes it easy to get a good up do without a lot of teasing and makes it easy to remold my hair as the day progresses. LOVE this product!!!</li>
    <li> This came on time - maybe a day or two sooner. I love this product. I have been using this for months and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> gave 4 stars. Some products out there work better. However this one is pretty good. have thin fine short hair.. This product works well if you are trying to grow your hair out or are in between hair cuts. Spray on and then put hair into place just the way you want it. works like a light hold wax but better. Just wish it had more hold because I have to finish with a hairspray. The kms hairplay  dry wax has a better hold and don&#x27;t need to follow up with hairspray...</li>
    <li> Great volume, shine, my go to hair product.</li>
    <li> So happy I found this discontinued product at such a reasonable price! (At a salon I had to pay more than 50% more). Was so sad to learn the company isn&#x27;t making anymore but of course Amazon had it! I have a long angled bob so this product is great for adding texture and a bit of volume without having to go crazy teasing your hair. Use it sparingly though because one extra spritz can equal greasy locks! A little goes a long way - hopefully Amazon will have it for a while but I stocked up with two packs of 2 just in case!</li>
    <li> If you have thick hair this doesn&#x27;t hold and makes your hair look greasy. I&#x27;ve tried it many different ways and that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s like for me.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to get a spray wax. When used sparingly (and I mean SPARINGLY) it does what I want, but easily feels heavy if overdone. I cannot recommend it for a second-day &#x27;do because it just adds too much weight (for thin, fine hair like mine, anyway).</li>
