    <li> Smell is somewhat off, not good.</li>
    <li> My sister loves this perfume so I bought this as a gift. The bottle is small, only an ounce, but she loves it although she would have preferred the larger bottle as she wears this everyday. I thought this size was more cost effective.</li>
    <li> Love my David Yurman perfume always! Dena thank you so much!</li>
    <li> It did not come in the original packaging as shown on the Amazon website.  It was part of a promotional David Yurman gift set.  Perfume in bottle looks and smell great; but I was just expecting it unopened in a David Yurman perfume box matching the picture shown.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume. My only complaint  is that you should show the correct picture for the bottle. I thought I  was getting what was shown in the picture and it was something completely different.</li>
    <li> Men love this smell on me</li>
    <li> Buy, Buy, Buy! Outstanding quality and much more affordable than we use to pay years ago. Great scent and always one of my favorite for my wife to wear...</li>
    <li> It exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> I use to wear this its the best my husband&lt;br /&gt;Loves it its a little light from what I&lt;br /&gt;Remember but its still pretty and sexy&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping will buy again</li>
    <li> Great value for a fine product for a Christmas gift that included a high quality Yurman jewelry case that made a great gift.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a night time person and got this hoping I could wear it daily. I can and love it. Lots of compliments. I will be getting another soon.</li>
    <li> Love this scent! Perfect sized bottle for this price</li>
    <li> all the wife will use, can not buy anywhere else.</li>
    <li> TBH, I hate the smell of this when I first put it on.  Give it 45 minutes, and it settles out. Combine it with Vanilla musk body spray and holy heck do the guys follow you. And last, yes, for a long time. Those that say it fades are forgetting that your nose gets so used to smelling it that it cancels it out, so you can&#x27;t smell it after a while. Go outside, get fresh air, go back inside and you smell it. Oh, um, and the guys luv, I may have mentioned? I tested it an all male hunting camp. But you only need a little!!!</li>
    <li> Perfect hard to find elsewhere</li>
    <li> Fell in love with the scent all over again. Great buy!</li>
    <li> I love this scent and would recommend it to anyone looking for a classy scent. As with anything , don&#x27;t overdue.</li>
    <li> Got it for a friend and she got it real fast and loves it.</li>
    <li> The only perfume that I use. Is my identity</li>
    <li> Love the nice box it came in.</li>
    <li> Received order today and when opening the package the content had leaked leaving the bottle half filled. I am requesting an exchange or refund. I like the perfume again, an exchange or refund. 973)214-3254.</li>
    <li> David Yurman, is a very different scent.  I always get a lot of complements when I ware it.  The scent after an hour will fade..</li>
