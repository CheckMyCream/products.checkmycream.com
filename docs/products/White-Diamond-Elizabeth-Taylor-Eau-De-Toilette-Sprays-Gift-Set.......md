    <li> Delightful fragrance. Soft and captivating.</li>
    <li> My grandma loved this set and I loved the price!</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gift to my Mom for Mother&#x27;s Day. She is a huge fan of Elizabeth Taylor. The scent is very nice, not too strong and over-bearing. But the scent is noticeable when worn. This box set includes: The perfume, smaller pocket size perfume, a shower gel and a body lotion. It came in a beautifully designed box. I would highly recommend this fragrance as a gift, Or for the more mature woman. I feel that this scent is for more mature older women. Overall, it is a beautiful scent.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift for my wife, and she complained that although the scent was nice, it wasn&#x27;t strong enough, and didn&#x27;t last.
