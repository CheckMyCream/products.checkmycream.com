<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This brush does a great job of de-tangling snarls without pulling the hair out or breaking any strands.  It is very soft, so multiple strokes in the same area may be required to do the trick.  My only small complaint is that the smooth finish makes it difficult to get a good grip with wet hands, I wish it were textured.</li>
    <li> Pulls out a lot of my hair, but its a great product and I have stopped using brushes and combs because of it.</li>
    <li> Love it!!! hair combing is not a nightmare any more</li>
    <li> Great price for this product!</li>
    <li> Well I love this. Can&#x27;t believe how it just smooths thru my hair. Way better than the denman brush or my comb. I loved it.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my child&#x27;s hairdresser, I bought the Tangle Teezer (TT) with high hopes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brushing my 4 year-old daughter&#x27;s long hair always entailed tears, tantrums and avoidance.  The first time we used the TT it went through her hair like butter, it was absolute bliss and I checked it wasn&#x27;t just skimming over the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The TT may have cost more than other brushes but it&#x27;s 1000 times better.  I haven&#x27;t used the detangling spray, leave-in conditioner or any other methods since we bought it.  I even bought the cool purple one for her brother and he really likes how it feels on his scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing if found is that it doesn&#x27;t work as well with wet hair.</li>
    <li> My child &amp; I both have very fine hair that tangles easily &amp; quickly. I use it on her every day &amp; the detangling doesn&#x27;t bother her at all. Works great for me too.</li>
    <li> I heard about this product from YouTube beauty gurus and it is totally not to my liking. Lots of hair comes out while using this brush. I have fine / long bob kind of hair.</li>
    <li> For the &#x27;naturals&#x27; out there, I have &#x27;4a&#x27; type hair, low density (fine/thin hair) and low porosity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: Gives good curl definition on my WET hair WITH some kind of product in it eg. Cantu shea butter cream&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: Do NOT use this on DRY hair. It will break your hair.&lt;br /&gt;  Even when used on WET detangled hair with product,I still found that there were too many strands left in the teezer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would NOT buy this again and would NOT recommend it to a &#x27;natural&#x27; sista. To me, it&#x27;s not worth it. I feel the same way about the Denman brush. Will post the review of it-same opinion as the teezer.</li>
    <li> It worked real good on my youngest granddaughters fine hair.  But my older granddaughter has heavy, thick hair and the teeth are not long enough to get through it.  you have to brush it a layer at a time.</li>
    <li> Im not a big fan of the tangle teaser, but I like it.  It&#x27;s hard to detangle a tiny part without having the brush to catch on another part that im detangling. I usually see more hair on the tangle teaser than on my wide tooth comb.</li>
    <li> I went natural about six months ago, NO PERMS. I had been looking for a way to untangle my hair easily after washing it. I Shave discovered a MIRACLE no joke the TANGLE TEEZER is awesome no blood sweat or tears combs through my hair effortlessly.So now all of my family and friends will be getting one for Christmas love it &#x27;</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just amazing! My hair is pretty damaged and tangled, but the comb helped me distangle my hair without any pain! So cool!</li>
    <li> My 6 yr. old has long medium-thickness hair.  Doing her hair was ALWAYS a pain as she would put up a major fuss.  There would almost always be crying involved.  I bought this Tangle Teezer in hopes of saving some sanity.  And it WORKED!  We have had it for 3 months now, and let me say, there has been NO crying! Seriously, not one tear over her hair!  I definitely recommend trying it.</li>
    <li> Thought it would be the perfect brush for our 3 yr old grand daughter. Her hair is very fine. On a scale of 1 to 10 I give it a 5.</li>
    <li> My girls have super thin hair and it gets really tangly.  FINALLY I decided to use this in the shower versus with dry hair and POOF!  Tangles gone!  Use with conditioner and you&#x27;ll be all set.  And since it&#x27;s plastic you can use in the shower with no worries of handles getting mildewy.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading raving reviews in a magazine and online. It is just OK, not the miracle product it promises to be. I have very thick hair, so it doesn&#x27;t get all the way through like regular brush. It is not very easy to clean out the hairs that get left behind either. I may use it for travel, but it will not replace my daily brush.</li>
    <li> My daughter had a hard time combing hair and removing the knots before this product came in her life. This has been such a huge life saver and I can&#x27;t appreciate it enough. My daughter has 2 of these and loves now to brush her hair without the pulls and pains. :)</li>
    <li> Exactly as described...I love it! I had seen this product advertised in an article about must have products. Its great!</li>
    <li> The Tangle Teezer is one of MANY products we have tried to tame our daughter&#x27;s mane.  This one works really well!  I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> works wonders! I don&#x27;t use any other brush now.</li>
    <li> My little girl has always been somewhat tender headed, not enough to prevent styling, wearing bows or any of the other normal girly stuff we want to do with her hair, yet enough to make swimming pool tangles and windy days somewhat of a pain to brush away. I searched Amazon for a solution to tangles in general and saw the reviews for the &amp;#34;Tangle Teaser&amp;#34;.  Let me just say, I&#x27;ve ordered another &amp;#34;Tangle Teaser&amp;#34; just in case something happens to the first. My daughter won&#x27;t do a spend the night without this brush and carries it every where she goes. She&#x27;s 12 and keeps an eye on her &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; better than her cell phone! Whenever she spends the night or one of friends stay the night, they all take turns using this brush. I&#x27;ve had mothers and daughters ask where I found it and how to order one for themselves. I know we love this brush, I can only imagine how much more we would love it if we were as tender headed as I&#x27;ve known some little girls to be. The Tangle Teaser may be pricey, but it&#x27;s totally worth it. I advise ordering two, because you&#x27;re going to want a back up.</li>
    <li> Our tangle teezer arrived today!  My youngest daughter who is 7 years old and has a head full of tangles could not put it down.  She loves this brush and how smooth it made her hair look and feel.  The tangles were gone in just a few strokes.  Normally she will not brush her hair after a shower or any other time for that matter unless she is forced to because she hates the pain of trying to get the tangles out of her long course hair.  Nor does she ever let me comb her hair without screaming.  She happily let me comb her hair and sat their relaxed and actually enjoyed having me brush her hair.  This is a first.  After putting her to bed I quickly ordered 2 more for backups.  This is easily a 5 Star!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this brush.  It does not hurt or break my daughter&#x27;s very fine hair, or my own hair, which is not particularly fine.  You don&#x27;t end up with a brush full of hair.  I would highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> This is AMAZING. My 2.5 year old has curly hair. Do it often mats up when she sleeps, it&#x27;s a disaster. This is the only brush she will let me use. You still need to go slow and because my daughter has really thick hair I have to do it in layers. This is to be expected and doesn&#x27;t cause any problems to do a small section at a time. My daughter wouldn&#x27;t hVe her hair. Rushed if it wasn&#x27;t for this product she runs away from all other brushes I&#x27;ve tried. 10/10 I would purchase this again.</li>
    <li> it is so helpful if you have tangeled hair  GET IT!</li>
    <li> I received the Tangle Teezer as a gift from my husband.  I have long, fine, thick, curly hair and I usually spend several minutes combing it out after washing and pulling out hundreds of hairs in the process.  The Tangle Teezer cut my detangling time down to less than a minute!  I also tried it on dry hair in the morning and this brush worked well then, too.  The brush itself is fairly large and looks like a horse curry comb.  It&#x27;s easy to grasp and work on the front of my head, but it&#x27;s a bit harder to use on the back of my head and my nape as there isn&#x27;t a handle to hold onto.  The only other thing I would like better is if the individual bristles were a bit longer.  I had to work in sections in the back and top of my head as the bristles weren&#x27;t long enough to reach my scalp since my hair is so thick.  I think the Tangle Teezer would be easier to use on someone else&#x27;s head rather than your own.</li>
    <li> No brush is magic and give you tangle free hair but I&#x27;m definitely a fan. Trying to comb or brush my hair with anything else feels too rough now. Never going back to old brushes.</li>
    <li> Really good, it does as advertised. I use it for about a year. The lower part is intact (I have another color which has discoloration and sometimes istarts to open by itself). Washes well with the soapy water and a brush.&lt;br /&gt;My 3,5 year old child uses it herself and we have no more tears.</li>
    <li> Same-o, same-o.  Not one thing special about this brush.  I will not trash it, but this purchase was ho-hum for sure..</li>
    <li> This is a great brush. Goes right thru hair with no pulling on it. After a day of riding the Harley, tangles are not a issue. No more pain of brushing hair.</li>
    <li> I had bought the tangle teezer some time ago and just repurchased a new one. I&#x27;m very happy with the brush, it gently combs through my waist length hair. Hardly ever any hair left at the base of the brush and it never yanks at my hair nor does it hurt my scalp. Highly recommend, oh, I highly recommend the seller New Pairs too, they shipped my tangle teezer extremely fast! good customer service and product:-)</li>
    <li> I have waist length hair that is very straight, very fine, and super easy to tangle and rip out.  I literally put my hair in a bun for this whole week to avoid having to deal with the snarls it was in.  I have arthritis and back problems so working an hour to rip out my hair snarls is not my favorite thing to do.  The Tangle Teezer came in today... I popped it out of the box... I detangled my entire head of hair in 3 minutes with barely any hair left in the brush!  OMG I&#x27;m in heaven.  I can&#x27;t wait to wash my hair and see how it works on wet hair.  I&#x27;m definitely buying another one real soon.  I also appreciate this price over paying for the Hair Bean.  Shipping was SUPER FAST.  All in all I&#x27;m seriously pleased with this product &amp; seller. &amp;lt;3</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this thing. I have four kids, three of them daughters. I used to absolutely dread the after the bath hair combing. This has solved the problem completely. Works as described!</li>
    <li> This was my second attempt in a week to order the Elite version.  Yet again, I received an Original Tangle Teezer that the seller put their own computer generated barcode sticker over the barcode over the barcode on the package.  This is extremely annoying and unethical.  Maybe they think you won&#x27;t notice you have been ripped off.  Reading some of the reviews, I am not the only one that experienced the scam.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s not same as shown on picture. it&#x27;s a good brush, it came in the box but i&#x27;m still quite unsure if it&#x27;s original or not.</li>
    <li> I have thin fine hair so i rarely get knots or tears. This tangle teezer glides effortlessly through my hair, it never catches or snags.</li>
    <li> I got this for my eight year old daughter and it works very well.  She is able to brush her own hair without any fighting.  She loves it that her Dad bought it for her.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter has the most tender head you can imagine and she loves her new brush!  Would buy again in a minute!</li>
    <li> I love my tangle teezer -- it is now the only brush I use! I have long, wavy, fine hair that&#x27;s VERY tangle prone. The short bristles on the brush are closely spaced &amp; flexible, so it&#x27;s able to navigate through my hair without too much pulling or breakage. I would give this product 5 stars, but... mine is starting to look pretty beat up. I purchased this item only a month ago, and now about a quarter of the bristles are now bent in different directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I also purchased the original tangle teezer for my sister, and she is not experiencing the same problem. The bristles on hers are a bit more flexible and seem to be made of a slightly different material. I think in the future, I will definitely go with the original tangle teezer vs. the salon elite!</li>
    <li> It works like a charm</li>
    <li> My daughter had dreaded getting her hair combed - this thing is a miracle worker. Now i barely hear her yelling when getting combed.</li>
    <li> This is miracle brush that really works! My daughter is using brush more ofter and her hear looks great now! Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Orange burst brush but what I got was a solid orange I was not happy with this also it does not match the shape of the picture or of the original Tangle teezer still works but not happy with the fact the I didn&#x27;t get what I ordered</li>
    <li> The only brush I&#x27;ve been able to use on my kids.  I ordered this one for my 6 yo son because he loves KTM dirt bikes, which have orange in the color scheme.</li>
    <li> I imagine it would work great for thin hair, but it does not get rid of tangles easily in my thick hair (wet or dry). This brush is great for a relaxing scalp massage though.</li>
    <li> Love these! They work on dry and damp hair! Not painful at all!</li>
    <li> I have a little over two feet of straight hair (comes down to my hips) and often spend a good ten minutes trying to gently untangle it with a stiff bristle brush. This thing untangled my hair in seconds. It doesn&#x27;t smooth my hair as nicely as a bristle brush does, but I still highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This really does detangle your hair being newly natural I didn&#x27;t know if I would like it but I do. I also don&#x27;t believe that it creates split ends but I believe thats depends on how you use it.</li>
    <li> This is my second Tangle Teezer after I let my sister have the first one I bought because she would not stop using it. It is literally the best brush if you have extremely curly hair like me. I have a hell of a lot of hair and my curls are about the diameter of a pencil. Combing through it has always been a chore, but I can get through my wet week-old hair in under 5 minutes with this.</li>
    <li> This brush detangles wet or dry hair without pulling and ripping through the tangles, and breaking hair.  I still recommend using proper brushing technique, by starting at the bottom and working your way up.  This brush is much kinder to your hair than a wide-tooth comb, and the several knock-off brushes that look similar to this one.  I&#x27;ve tried several knock-offs and the bristles are stiffer and don&#x27;t &amp;#34;give&amp;#34; when a tangle is encountered the same way this one does.  When you encounter a tangle, don&#x27;t rip through it with the brush.  Carefully detangle it with your fingers so your hair doesn&#x27;t break off.  Also, use some sort of detangling serum, conditioner, or argan oil (or other oil of your choice... coconut and jojoba are nice, too) on your hair to help give it slip and the detangling will go much smoother.  Tangles are easier to prevent than to undo, no matter what brush you use, but this brush is the best detangling tool I have encountered.</li>
    <li> I actually bought two of these at different times, and this isn&#x27;t the Elite version.  The Elite is more rounded--not flat on the top like this one is.  The box it came in said &amp;#34;Original,&amp;#34; but the product label said &amp;#34;Elite.&amp;#34;  It&#x27;s definitely not the Elite.</li>
    <li> I was so thrilled to try this for mine &amp; my daughter&#x27;s hair after reading all the 5-star reviews on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a bust!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mainly bought it for my daughter because her hair is very fine &amp; gets tangled quite easily. She doesn&#x27;t like getting her hair brushed, usually ends in tears. I dread having to do it! This thing does nothing a regular brush can&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a lot of very thick hair. It did nothing for me either, in fact, worse than a regular brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few things about it...&lt;br /&gt;-There are no small balls at the ends of the bristles to soften the impact to your scalp. This thing scrapes!&lt;br /&gt;-The bristles are much more flexible than a regular brush&#x27;s. The bristles just kind of bent on top of my hair, were not strong enough to go through it.&lt;br /&gt;-It pulls and breaks hair - I think due to the different height bristles. I have never lost so much hair brushing than I did with this product.&lt;br /&gt;-Awkward shape. I prefer a handle.</li>
    <li> After reading the other reviews I was really hoping this would work as well as others say it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a 2-year old with long, thin, curly hair and brushing it dry isn&#x27;t so bad but as soon as I shampoo it it&#x27;s like it clumps up and I can&#x27;t run my hands through it without really pulling it and hurting her (and she definitely lets me know it hurts!). So I figured I&#x27;d buy this brush, shampoo her hair and then use the brush to wash it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works. Perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other great thing is that when my wife and daughter dry brush their hair there is only a couple strands left on the brush whereas on other combs/brushes, there are clumps left behind.</li>
    <li> My daughter can not stand having her thick hair brushed. She always screams!!!  The tangle teaser is the only way we can get her to brush her hair.  Wet or dry!</li>
    <li> He despises having his hair brushed. Ths worked nicely. Not so much for my longer thicker hair but worth it for him.</li>
    <li> Just bought a 2nd brush, this time for my toddler (18 mos). He had used mine a couple of times and he liked it much more than his own brushes and combs... The larger size is ok for him - just means fewer strokes, and he seems to like the way the bristles feel against his scalp. With his old brush it took many strokes on each section for all hair strands to move in the same direction, this one gets them all with one stroke.</li>
    <li> Though it gets through the tangles, it also removes lots of hair, now than my wide tooth comb.</li>
    <li> Had to try something different to get through my childs long, thick, hair.&lt;br /&gt;Looked at this for a while, but held off due to it&#x27;s normal price being $39.99.&lt;br /&gt;I finally found one that came to about half of that, including shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really does work very well, not tearing the hair. It does take a bit of finesse due to the bristle not being very long, but it is really not a problem in the slightest, just have to pay a bit more attention than you would with a traditional hair brush. Brushing time is greatly reduced, hair look nice and shiney, and I&#x27;m sure my child appreciates it as it brings no pain to the party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An definitely glad I bought it. It is simple plastic, and I am sure that the cost to manufacture in significantly lower that even the price I paid. Look for a good deal if you can wait, and even look at some other brands, like goody, that make similar. I will be.</li>
    <li> this is very useful, I love it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great brush aside from the fact that it&#x27;s not particularly easy to grip. Maybe the shape needs to be tinkered with but it does work well and it truly doesn&#x27;t pull at my hair.</li>
    <li> My daughters hair gets super matted in the winter because of her coat hood. So bad in fact that every three days we sit in front of the TV and it takes me 45 full minutes of separating and detangling. I bought the Tangle Teezer and some Mane n&#x27; Tail detangler and it took 7 minutes tonight. 7 minutes! We were in shock. It didn&#x27;t hurt at all and it was awesome. Definitely worth the money but I would get the Mane n&#x27; Tail while your at it.</li>
    <li> My two year old daughter has pretty short, fine, straight hair, and yet when I brush it she acts like she&#x27;s being murdered. So I tried this out, on high recommendation, and it is amazing. She actually requested I brush her hair and didn&#x27;t complain about the &amp;#34;tingles.&amp;#34; I used it too, and I don&#x27;t know how it works but it&#x27;s really great.</li>
    <li> easy to use, really works. My daughter did not complain to comb the hair and untangles it. I love it</li>
    <li> I bought this for my granddaughter who has very curly hair. After reading the reviews I was expecting a &amp;#34;no more tears&amp;#34; experience. We didn&#x27;t get that. It&#x27;s a little better but it still pulls and tugs at the tangles. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have super long straight fine hair and a lot of it.  It prefers to knot constantly.  But it is easier to gently coax out the knots with this little weird brush.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> very good for brushing wet or dry hair.</li>
    <li> I love this bush.  This is my second one and I will keep buying them until they stop making them.  I have always had issues with tangles in my hair and having to pull and yank to get the brush through my wet hair and even dry hair sometimes.  With this brush it makes it so easy and painless. Awesome product.</li>
    <li> This brush ROCKS!! I no longer have to chase my daughter amid her screams to brush her hair. The bristles are soft and gentle, massaging her hair as you brush. Perfect for all hair types too!! My daughter has long, curly hair and this brush is a life saver.</li>
    <li> This works great on detangling my long super curly hair (wet). I will definitely be recommending it to my friends. Try it!</li>
    <li> I live in the far south where it is humid all the time, so not only do I have the weather to deal with but I have very fine hair.  This brush is so great I do not even know where to begin.  I get very bad tangles because I cannot use conditioner (at least not much) and this brush had no problem getting them out.  It does pull sometimes, but I am very impatient, so it is probably my fault.  I have fairly long hair and it usually takes at least five minutes to get through brushing it, but with this brush it takes about half of the time.  I wish this had a handle and a different design, but the current design is not bad after you get used to the feel.  Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Great Tangle Teeser. You have to be patience when you used because it did not works like a magic act but it is great for fine hair.</li>
    <li> Oh my goodness. I didn&#x27;t really believe all of its hype. Then I bite the bullent and bought one to try on my grandaughter&#x27;s hair. All I can say is nothing, NOTHING, had ever worked with her thick tresses. Brushing her hair was like trying to land on the beaches in Normandy. Yelling, tears, refusals. Not any more. This thing goes through the toughest tangles like a warm knife through butter. take a chance and get one. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love it... It&#x27;s a great brush and works wonderfully with wet hair. Perfect for kids and fine hair. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Works quite well on thick hair and tangles. It is stronger than it looks. Orange was the only available color when I bought this for my daughter but she loves it.I would recommend this for anyone who has trouble with tangles  and traditional brushes.It&#x27;s been very durable. Good price.I would purchase another if pink becomes available.</li>
    <li> Tangle Teezer has really improved the design and quality of the hairbrush compared to its first model. This new design won&#x27;t break into two pieces if you drop it on the floor and the overall size and shape is more ergonomic. It feels more substantial in your hand and just seems better all around. The first model was nice but this one is really awesome. Tangle Teezer makes having long hair a pleasure and not a chore. I will always use this product for my long hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s called a tangle teezer because it teases my tangles into thinking they will be gone! Not sure why the rave reviews. I have very thick, tangly hair and this actually made everything worse. Took 20 minutes to try to brush out my hair. Also noticed my hair broke off a lot. The bristles actually bent and broke off. What? What the? Didn&#x27;t even bother trying to return it: threw it straight in the trash.</li>
    <li> This is my third Tangle Teezer brush, and I love what it does for my hair. I&#x27;ve introduced it to a few stylists, and they are as excited about how well it works on curly hair as I am. It reduces breakage, and I can detangle my hair wet or dry with it-a feat I was never able to accomplish with any other comb or brush. I&#x27;m really glad I made the investment!</li>
    <li> I have been a stylist for 12 + years and have never found a tool I loved so much! This is amazing for getting rid of tangles, and for healthy scalp care. I normally have very dry scalp in the winter and this has helped me so much!</li>
    <li> Well, what can I say? It&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve been bothered by the fact that something was made for right handed people and NOT lefties. It works in my left hand, but it&#x27;s WAY more comfy in my right and just flows through my hair, over my head when using my right hand. It&#x27;s obviously ergonomically made for the right hand, nice n snug. In my left, the little point aims outward and the brush moves around making me have to grip it tighter. It&#x27;s really no big deal as I&#x27;m used to dealing with those things but it has been a long time since I&#x27;ve used something that&#x27;s obviously not concerned with that. Maybe it&#x27;s a USA thing...we&#x27;re more &amp;#34;PC&amp;#34; about lefties. Lol Who the hell knows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I checked out the Original model...still obviously built for the right hand. I love this brush. It flows through my hair like there were no tangles to begin with. Awesome brush. My son likes it too since he&#x27;s 2.5 yrs old and there&#x27;s no long handle to confuse his mechanics causing him to aim the bristles away from his sweet head. He can brush his hair nicely with this giving him more power and control over his life. Lol Poor little guy. ;) But guess what? He&#x27;s also a lefty! Lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We need a lefty model! We LOVE this brush! :)</li>
    <li> Daughter loves this - works as advertised.</li>
    <li> I am sad to say but we are not a fan of this brush.  My daughter is 3 and has long straight but finer hair.  I have normal thickness straight to wavy shoulder length hair.  My daughter screamed when I used this on her (worse than when I just use a regular brush).  I have tried it on her hair wet and dry and she doesn&#x27;t like it.  It sounds like it is ripping her hair.  I tried it on myself and it feels like I am ripping my hair and the bristles are very sharp and feel like acupuncture on your scalp, ears, shoulders, back or any area of skin it comes into contact with while brushing.  I gave it to my mom to try and she has the same reaction as us.  I was so excited to get this brush and had wanted it for a while for my daughter but we don&#x27;t use it because it is worse for her than our normal brush.</li>
    <li> This product came quickly and was not damaged. It is also an amazing brush! I love it, I won&#x27;t use anything else to brush my hair anymore. I wish I had known about this when I had longer hair as this is simply amazing. No matter how gross my hair is, this gets through it without a problem. I&#x27;ve brushed through mousse, hairspray, and curls slathered with product and had no problem getting through.</li>
    <li> I bought this as my nieces use it but to me it&#x27;s awful.  It pulls at my 6 year olds thick hair terribly and I can&#x27;t use it at all.  Much more painful than the regular brush we use.  Want to throw it away but what a waste of money.</li>
    <li> My hair has transformed after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have really very frizzy, curly hair, spiral curls that just end up in a tangled, matted mess after one night of sleep. But with this brush, I am able to really define my curls and they stay nice overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take my hair routine very seriously, and would never recommend a sub-par product. This brush with Argan Magic [[ASIN:B008HRRWHM Argan Magic Nourishing Hair Cream 8fl Oz]] really is magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea how this brush works, all I know is that for anyone with an ounce of curl in their hair, they need this brush in their life.</li>
    <li> She has very curly hair that tangles easily no matter what I do.  Combing and brushing it has been met with screaming and tears ever since her hair came in at 2 years old.  I have avoided combing it to avoid the battle, which of course just makes it worse when I can&#x27;t avoid it any longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So on a recommendation I bought this.  It works great.  A little detangle spray (which I used before as well) and this gets out the tangles very quickly without any tears.  I was shocked.  I thought maybe it was a fluke and her hair wasn&#x27;t that tangly.  But every time I have brushed it since this arrived has been the same:  no tears, no battle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her only complaint was that she doesn&#x27;t like the color orange.  I like the orange, it is harder to lose.</li>
    <li> A great little brush -- both for humans and my very difficult dog.  This brush even won an award from Queen Elizabeth (She must have &#x27;tangled hair&#x27; -- it is a really great little invention.</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush after hearing and reading raving news on how great it works on curly hair and decided to try it out. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now and I love it!! Although my hair is naturally curly it doesn&#x27;t really get too tangled but I wanted to try something other than my comb which pulls a lot of my hair out. This brush is awesome and does the job. My hair glides through it like butter and I&#x27;ve noticed my hair doesn&#x27;t fall out as much. I highly recommend it not only for curly hair but any hair type. It&#x27;s done wonders for mine!!</li>
    <li> I love this brush - it doesn&#x27;t pull or snag on my naturally dry, unprocessed, undyed hair and makes my hair so much easier to rinse out (my hair is also very porous). I am very, very happy and have been recommending it to all my friends who have difficulty brushing their hair - long or short!</li>
    <li> For what this is, I really love it. It&#x27;s the only brush I use for my whole head. Being plastic, I was expecting it to cause static but it didn&#x27;t at all. It feels a little cheap in your hand but that certainly doesn&#x27;t change how it performs. Before this brush I was getting so fed up with my long, thick, and curly hair that I was thinking about chopping it off- but I&#x27;m now glad I didn&#x27;t. I prefer this on dry hair but it works on wet hair as well (just not as easily).</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my Grand daughter who has long thick hair. She loves it and says its the best brush she ever had.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  Easy to use with the most challenging curly, stringy hair and the compact size great for purses.</li>
    <li> Horrible. Use only if you have thin thin hair. We have 2 people in the house with thick hair and all this could do is brush down the outer layer while leaving the under layer tangled.</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to. The one we received though is solid orange. No yellow like in picture. My daughter was disappointed to get a plain colored model instead of the multicolored one in the picture.</li>
    <li> I have thin fine hair and I would try every product and &amp;#34;wet hairbrush&amp;#34; when I got out of the shower to get my brush through my hair. Products would either weigh my hair down or leave it oily. This lithe brush does the job with no products needed!!! I rather an brush with a handle though.</li>
    <li> I bought this for myself but my 5 year old daughter has curly hair and is amazing on it! She loves brushing her hair now &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I have very tight spiral curls and only use my hands to comb through after washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t think a comb could be used on my hair type.  I was proved wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing is amazing.  Only used on wet hair - detangled like a breeze, no to little pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just wish it had a better grip or a handle - as it can get slippery with product getting on hands and comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, would buy again and highly recommend to anyone - any hair type.</li>
    <li> my daughter is mixed (black &amp; filipino) so her hair is a little crazy. She used to hate having her hair brushed with a regular brush. Screaming, crying, everything...it was horrible. I started looking into the tangle teezer and I do not regret my decision to get one at all. She barely even notices when I brush her hair.</li>
    <li> I have super long, super fine hair that just LOVES to tangle. I have been ripping through these tangles with a paddle brush until I watched a youtube review on this brush. I bought it and I have to say it&#x27;s been helping A LOT! It does take some time to get used to the brush and it does take some time to actually brush through the tangles, however when I&#x27;m done brushing all the tangles out of my hair, I have lost a lot less hair than if I would have used my paddle brush. If you have difficult hair, I&#x27;d recommend trying this brush!</li>
    <li> Just bought this at Boots (UK) today for my 7 year old. Yesterday it took me 20 minutes and two conditioning treatments to get the snarls out of her long, medium-curly hair (I don&#x27;t think her hair had been brushed all weekend ...) Just now, with no detangling spray or wails, this gadgety brush gave her shiny, smooth non-rats-nest hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I debated spending 10 pounds on a hairbrush, but the daily pre-school waterboarding, I mean hair brushing, was getting old. HIGHLY recommend this brush for those of you with girls who either a) have thick curly hair or b) hate to have their hair brushed even if it isn&#x27;t tangled. I&#x27;m buying a second one for when this one goes missing!</li>
    <li> I bought this brush a few weeks ago for my 3 year old daughter who hates to have her hair brushed, her hair is very thin like mine and tangles very easily. This brush easily takes all the tangles out with no fuss! I use it on my hair as well, wet and dry with excellent results, would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Where was this product during my last thirty five years of tangle battles? It is the single best hair-related purchase I have ever made.  I bought it on a friend&#x27;s recommendation for my son&#x27;s morning snarls, but I&#x27;ve since stolen it for myself.  I have thick, long, wavy hair that loves to tangle into massive &amp;#34;rat&#x27;s nests&amp;#34; at my neck, and this brush is miraculous at taming the tangles without tearing out or breaking my hair.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> My hair seems to be able to go through this brush better than most but it&#x27;s no miracle for me. It stills tugs and pulls but it is alot better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used. Will keep using unless I find something better. I just feel NO brush or comb can really do magic I think it&#x27;s hair product that really helps with the knots.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 2 year old daughter who has very long and curly hair. She doesn&#x27;t like getting her hair brushed but it works and seems to pull her hair less than other brushes. I really like it for my own hair also. I bought it in neon orange so it will be easier to find!</li>
    <li> I Realy enjoy this. With sensitive skin(scalp), and hair that is long and thick that goes down to my butt, this product is fablulous. The teeth are plastic and are different than a normal hair brush. In other hair brushes the teeth are stiff but in this product they are movable an get the knots out without yanking. You can use this wet or dry. I love it both ways and i very much recomend this product.</li>
    <li> It worked great for about a year.  The bristles are now worn out, and it no longer will go through hair at all.  I also bought another brand that has a handle on it.  The bristles on the other brand have held up over time as they were stiffer to begin with, but not so stiff as to cause pain when brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, I recommend another brand that has stiffer bristles and a handle.  This brush worked well in the beginning to get tangles out though.</li>
    <li> A co-worker recommended this brush and gave me one for my oldest daughter when she was about 3.  My daughter (like many little girls out there) hates to have her hair brushed.  She has curly hair, below her shoulders, about mid-thickness that is almost always tangled.  Hair brushing always brought on the waterworks and was a terrible experience for both of us, no matter what tool we used or who had control of it.  This brush was a game-changer.  My daughter still doesn&#x27;t like to stand still for getting her hair brushed, but she&#x27;ll tolerate it with this one.  It&#x27;s a little wide for her little hands, but she still manages to grip it pretty well to brush her hair on her own, too.  The teeth don&#x27;t look like they are long enough to thoroughly detangle thicker hair, but they do a fantastic job.  I have very thick, sometimes long hair.  I occasionally grow it out to donate.  For past donations, as I get close to the length requirement, I start pulling muscles in my neck working out the tangles underneath and at the ends after a shower.  I&#x27;m past 10\\&quot; below my chin, and not one pulled muscle since I&#x27;ve been using this brush, which means I&#x27;ll try to go for well past the minimum this time.  Just bought a second for convenience.</li>
    <li> Combing my daughter&#x27;s long hair was a traumatic experience for both of us before we got this brush.  It really made a big difference.  It goes through her tangles beautifully and takes less time.  Pain free, which is all I was hoping for (and so was she!).  I read some said that it was hard to get a hold of, but I don&#x27;t find that issue.  I actually bought a second one in purple, and for some reason both my kids prefer the orange burst.</li>
    <li> Definitely a great brush if you have kids! I bought for my two daughters who are 5 and 4 and they love it because it truly does what it advertises! Highly recommend getting one! Especially if you have little girls!</li>
    <li> Works great on my 18 month old!</li>
    <li> I really love this brush. I have below the waist length hair and I use it in the shower as well as on dry hair.  Really keeps the tangles out!</li>
    <li> This was not the miracle-worker I had hoped for on my hair. BUT! It works amazingly well for my dog!!! A Japanese Chin, she has long-silky hair and really dreads the slicker pin brush. This alternative feels good to her and doesn&#x27;t pull, so she&#x27;s not uneasy when it makes an appearance. The design also makes it easy for me to handle while I&#x27;m brushing her. Who knew? :)</li>
    <li> I LOVE my tangle teezer so much. I have hair down to my hips and this takes out the tangles with ease. I have used it for about a year and it is not worn out at all. It is a great value and is small enough to carry in a purse.</li>
    <li> I have 3 yorkies and they all have different hair type! I read about this on a blog and I ordered it. What a blessing! My girls do not mind me brushing them and 2 of them love it! Wish I had found this earlier! It does not pull, it releases the hair without pulling and that way you can work out knots, I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> These are the best for my two daughter&#x27;s hair.  Works for my oldest with thin straight hair, and my youngest with thick curly hair.  They love these brushes!</li>
    <li> So much less fighting for both my hair and my daughter&#x27;s.  I bought a second one to use in the shower to comb my conditioner through.  Love it.</li>
    <li> No more tears when brushing my daughter&#x27;s curly hair! She and I LOVE this and highly recommend it to everyone!!!</li>
    <li> Does Not Work As Advertised. Waste Of Money. Very Disapponted With This Product. Would Not Recommend This Item. My Daughter Was very Sad That It Didn&#x27;t Work</li>
    <li> Its very gentle.  Use it for my cats, and they love it!!!! Its also very easy to clean. It fits nicely in the palm of your hand too.</li>
    <li> this does help my daughter brush through her tangles easier than with a regular hair brush. my only complaint is that the teeth on this brush are really sharp. I have accidently hit her ears with it and she has cried. Just be careful when brush the little one&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> I tried this after reading such great reviews. I have thick hair so detangling was always difficult. This brush makes it so much easier! Plus it&#x27;s super easy to clean. Could not recommend more.</li>
    <li> I thought this might be some gimmick but as my 8 year old has successfully brushed her hair by herself every day since she received it I am calling this a winner!!  She has trouble brushing/combing her hair as it is pretty sensitive and hurts her a lot.  She has done very, very well with this brush!  An added bonus was that it is available in her favorite color.</li>
    <li> This product was made with a cheaper material than I thought. Good brush but needs to be stronger for those with super curly, unmanageable hair. But I might have just looked at the wrong brush to buy</li>
    <li> This actually works as advertised. It isn&#x27;t a magic cure for tangles caused by toddler gunk-in-hair-syndrome, but it&#x27;s the closest thing to waving a magic wand over the three year old bed head I&#x27;ve ever seen. We have far fewer tantrums over morning hair brushing than ever before.</li>
    <li> Definitely would highly recommend!! This is our second one, had to buy another since my daughter keeps taking it with her, regular brushes pull your hair, this does not!! It will easily brush through curls and tangles, much better than any other brush.  I could not live without it!!</li>
    <li> I have thin curly hair, and often it rips off in the shower or when it try brushing it. This baby does wonders! Detangles everything and keeps my hair in place</li>
    <li> We love this brush!! Our daughter has never let us brush through her hair without crying and begging us not to. We brushed through her hair this morning in about one minute (it usually takes 15+ minutes of fighting and crying). We were to the point where if we couldn&#x27;t find something that didn&#x27;t work we were going to chop her hair off. This product changed everything no tears no sadness. I can not wait to brush her hair out in the morning!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t bother. My hair is still falling out and breaking in massive chunks in the shower! I don&#x27;t think this $10 brush has done anything to help prevent that, unfortunately. Maybe others will have better luck. I do have very fine slippery hair, although a LOT of it, so I have a lot TO lose. I had hoped this would help me, but not so much. I do have a friend that likes hers! Love the color though! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> My gf&#x27;s hair is hard to comb, when she combs her hair, it&#x27;s very hurt, so I buy this come for her. Haha, it&#x27;s very easy to comb, she like it very much.</li>
    <li> Great product! My daughter has very, very curly hair that tangles easily. It&#x27;s also very long. I was amazed that this brush was such a big help. I use it while her hair is wet and it really speeds up the process of combing out her hair. I only wish I had discovered this brush when she was a few years younger. It would have saved us both dreading shampoo night!</li>
    <li> I have detangled my daughter&#x27;s hair many times with this and it&#x27;s great! Minimal hair loss and no more crying!!</li>
    <li> Takes out tangles wonderfully, there&#x27;s no fuss! Perfect size for travel or on-the-go. Fabulous colour! It was worth every penny!</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic hair brush!!  It does exactly as described remove tangles.  I also love the color.  A++++  Thanks</li>
    <li> I got one for myself and one for my grand daughter. This brush works to easily detangle our hair. The best brush I ever had.</li>
    <li> It brushes through my hair so well, without ripping it out. I love it!</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this tangle teezer!!! As a woman of color with natural hair(3C) I assume things like these are for women with straighter hair but BOY was i wrong! This has changed my detangling routine, it&#x27;s no longer a routine for starters and I have no more knots. No longer do I sit in the mirror ripping balls of hair out (not literally), no longer do I need to take hours to do my hair (detangling was a big problem lol), no longer do I give up and just go to the salon! Free at last Free at last, we are TANGLE free at last!</li>
    <li> I have tailbone-length straight hair. This brush does a great job of detangling. This brush is made in two pieces which are not sealed together. This can allow water to enter into the housing and create mold, but you can easily separate the bristle plate from the &amp;#34;handle&amp;#34; portion to clean. After separating the halves I use a toothbrush, mild soap, and warm running water to clean this brush. Then I set the halves on a towel, reassembling when dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had my tangle teaser for about 2 years. After that time, the bristle plate does not snap securely onto the handle half. This is caused by my separating to clean I&#x27;m sure. Also, beware! Dogs love to chew on these brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use my old tangle teaser in the shower to brush shampoo through my hair, which is detangled prior to showering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cringe whenever I hear snapping hair, but this brush is very gentle. A must-have for long-haired people!</li>
    <li> This pulled some of my hair out. It didn&#x27;t hurt though.</li>
    <li> This has cut down my detangling time in half!  I have curly 3c-4a african american hair and this helped me so much!! great product, easy to use and very easy to clean.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t really untangle hair. It is simply an ineffective brush.</li>
    <li> I thought that the Tangle Teezer was all hype and words, but it really works! I&#x27;ve used this for several months now, and just a few weeks ago, I cut my hair to my shoulders. My hair used to reach my butt and though it was relatively straight, it would knot very easily and form near-dreads. A regular brush would break my hair and rip it so easily, but the Tangle Teezer effortlessly glided through my hair. It wasn&#x27;t completely painless, I don&#x27;t think brushing hair can be 100% painless when you have a lot of tangles, but the Tangle Teezer definitely made it 90% less painful. Now that I have short hair I don&#x27;t really have tangles but I still rely on the Tangle Teezer because it is so nice to grip and carry around with me!</li>
    <li> After years and years of spending an hour or more detangling my hair with a normal comb and brush, I heard about the Tangle Teezer. I thought that there was absolutely no way that it would be able to detangle my extremely thick hair, but I thought it was worth a shot. I ordered this brush and was amazed that it detangled my hair in less than 20 minutes. I am overjoyed to have the Tangle Teezer. Even with my longer than waist length thick hair, it still glided easily through. I did not use any detangling spray or run my fingers through my hair before I used the brush and I was amazed that I had next to no frizz or breakage and it did not pull out a lot of my hair. Usually when I comb my hair I end up with a handful of hair and with this brush I ended up with 1 strand that came out and that was it. I will never use a regular brush or comb again.</li>
    <li> the packaging is not the same as it is in picture. it is actually an old edition (original) which has different shape and color with the &amp;#34;elite&amp;#34; one. not hard to use but i was anticipating to receive the new edition.</li>
    <li> After reading all the good reviews i ordered this product for my daughter bi racial dry curly hair. It works well and gets all the tangles out when her hair is wet. But it works just as good as any other combs i have used for my daughter.</li>
    <li> My hair is long, super fine and gets tangled very very easily. This definitely works better than my normal brush or comb but was not quite the miracle brush I hoped for. I would recommend it though.</li>
    <li> My daughter is biracial, and detangling has been a nightmare for the past few years. I was skeptical that the Tangle Teezer would work on her hair, but so many people mentioned it online that I thought we&#x27;d give it a shot, and I&#x27;m glad we did. Not only does it remove tanlges gently, but it doesn&#x27;t destroy her curls. I use it like this: I section off her hair, apply conditioner liberally, and gently pull the snarls loose with my fingers. Then, beginning at the ends, I use the Tanlge Teezer to gently remove tangles; I start at the ends and slowly, an 1&amp;#34; at a time, work my way up towards her scalp. Then I rinse most of the conditioner out, leaving some at the ends, add some Mixed Chix leave-in, and let it air dry. It works well to untagle her hair without tugging or destroying her natural curl pattern.&lt;br /&gt;I left off one star becuase as I said, we use this product when her hair is wet (you should only brush curly hair when it&#x27;s wet) and a handle would be nice here, or at least a non-slip grip.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of hair and its somewhat thick, so i had to section it in 8 parts for it to be properly detangled, some of the bristles are already broken after just a few months of use.</li>
    <li> I have very long straight fine hair and it gets tangled so easily. It was so painful until I got this brush.</li>
    <li> At first I was a bit unsure about all the hype, but this brush is really amazing. I lose a lot of hair throughout the day and especially when brushing my wet hair, and it doesn&#x27;t happen as much with the Tangle Teezer.</li>
    <li> I have extensions and this doesn&#x27;t catch in them or pull hard.  Highly recommended if you have hair extensions or long hair!</li>
    <li> Works just OK on the tangling my 3 year old&#x27;s small, dry Brillo-patch on back of head. I couldn&#x27;t imagine this being much help for a head of frizzy tight curls. Does cause breakage to her dry fine hair back there as well.</li>
    <li> My daughter drew a cartoon of herself after 1 day with this brush. The first picture is her sobbing and begging us not to brush her hair. The second panel has her brushing her hair with this brush, and me telling her she&#x27;s already brushed it enough! She loves it. She has silky smooth thin straight blond hair, that mats up every night in bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son also has a sensitive scalp and hates brushing his long hair.. thinks this is the best brush ever. His hair is thick, straight, and tangles as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels like a nice massage, doesn&#x27;t tug at most knots..works great on my mid to long length hair too (also straight, also tangles easily), I have no idea how it works on other hair textures.&lt;br /&gt;It has stopped the crying and freaking out every time we brush!</li>
    <li> I really like this Brush! It rescues my hair. I feel no hurt anymore when brushing my hair. Worth buying.</li>
    <li> I really like the Tangle Teezer. It goes right through my long, thick hair when it&#x27;s wet or damp out of the shower, which is awesome. Normally I pull out enough hair to make a wig in this process alone. It&#x27;s great for daily brushing and in fact, I find that when I use normal brushes now, my hair gets caught in them, so I go back to the TT. However, if my hair is REALLY a mess, like after a long day, plus a nap, plus housework, it still can&#x27;t get through my hair with no problem, and I have to do the bottom up method to brush it, and there is pulling involved. However, the pulling is still less than with a regular brush. I will say that while the design of the brush is good, I increasingly wish it had a handle, because my hair is getting quite long, and it&#x27;s harder to reach the lengths with this brush AND hold onto it. Sometimes this brush gets thrown across the bathroom on accident. Overall, I&#x27;m happy with this product. I even bought more so I could have one in my bathroom, one in my purse, and one next to my bed.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s adorable. All the reviews said it&#x27;s great for all hair types so I bought this for my boyfriend with crazy thick curly hair. He&#x27;s been using my brush that I&#x27;ve had for at least 5 years with a shattered mirror on one side and I got this so he could have his own. Plus he loves orange- his first car and phone were orange. :)&lt;br /&gt;He hasn&#x27;t used it yet because in giving it to him for Christmas but I will say the bristles are softer than i hoped. It may still work, but they feel like dog brush bristles.</li>
    <li> Hard to get through thick hair as the plastic bristles are too short.  Kids like it though and it gets them to brush their own hair more.</li>
    <li> OH MY GOSH!  I have really fine hair, and lots of it.  It tangles really easily.  I had been using a paddle brush to get through it when dry, and a suoper wide tooth comb when wet.  But I still ended up tearing out lots of hair.  This is amazing.  I cannot believe how gently and thoroughly it gets through my hair.  Briliant!</li>
    <li> Still using it even after 2 years. For tangled hair, start from the bottom and work your way up the head. That way you tackle tangles easier. Also, to take better care of it, pull out hairs from it after brushing and use a toothpick to pick up cotton threads at the base of each bristle.</li>
    <li> It untangle my hair easily but in this winter time, it looks like it attract more static...</li>
    <li> i was intimidated by my kinky hair but i brought this brush and will be buying a few more. Great!!</li>
