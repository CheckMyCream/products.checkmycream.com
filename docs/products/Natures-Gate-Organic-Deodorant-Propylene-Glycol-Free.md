      <li>I love everything about this except that by the end of the day it smells like I didn&#x27;t use anything.</li>
      <li>but the scent is mostly manly, when i wear it, it smelled garlciky on my skin...</li>
      <li>However it is not my favorite sent.</li>
      <li>I smell okay for about 3 hours</li>
      <li>I love that this is all organic.</li>

      <li>i do have to apply it more often living in florida and it being summertime</li>
      <li>This deodorant has a nice, clean fragrance.</li>
      <li>Been using this brand for about a year and is working out fine for me.</li>
      <li>but i enjoy it.</li>

      <li>Our unique formulas contain Certified Organic Extracts of Witch Hazel, Juniper Berry, Echinacea and Rosemary for their odor-controlling properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>i love the natural products, i love the brand.</li>
      <li>Perfect natural scent that will last 3 hours.</li>
      <li>However I would not recommend this for sports or anything outdoors does not protect good enough for workouts</li>
      <li>Now I use some other organic stuff and its great.</li>
      <li>Also, though the scent is decent, I didn&#x27;t find it particularly appealing as a deodorizer.</li>
      <li>I like this specific item, Tea Tree &amp; Blue Cyprus, the best.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s going under your armpit, into the lymph area by quick absorption, and running through your system.  </li>
      <li>I bought this product because I read some pretty good reviews, but it was a big mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Smelled really fresh but didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
      <li>The scent of the product is nice, but it only lasts for about a hour for me</li>
      <li>This is a nice deodorant and lasts for a long period of time.  </li>
      <li>At this time, the first ingredient, (ie, most of the product) is: \\&quot;propanediol\\&quot;, which is TOTAL genetically modified from corn syrup.  </li>
      <li>First time use.</li>
      <li>Good for days of low physical activity and weather that is 69 degrees Fahrenheit or cooler.</li>
      <li>Working in a office for 8 hours, my pits don&#x27;t get much air.  </li>
      <li>But then I tried Tom&#x27;s all natural deodorant (can&#x27;t remember the exact name)</li>
      <li>This was my first purchase of natural deodorant.</li>
      <li>I do recognize the heady tea tree scent as the main scent with the cypress as an undertone.</li>
      <li>Hopefully the seller well send me a new one since this one came with a messed up top.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Been using natural deo for years now and  wanted to try something new.</li>
      <li>A healthier, improved choice as far as I am concerned though.</li>
      <li>and I had black sweater fuzz stuck to my not at all fresh armpits when I got home from the office after my first and last day using this product.</li>
      <li>*, Echinacea* and Rosemary*; Sodium Chloride (Sea Salt), Ethylhexylglycerin (Vegetable Glycerin), Certified Organic Tea Tree Oil*, Cetyl Alcohol (Vegetable), Stearic Acid (Vegetable), Wild Crafted Blue Cypress Oil, Grapefruit Seed Extract, Pure Essential Oil of Peppermint.</li>
      <li>I know that everyone&#x27;s body chemistry is different, so natural deodorant just may not work for me, but I may try another natural deodorizer soon.</li>
      <li>It smells great, but it isn&#x27;t very long lasting, unfortunately.</li>
      <li>I have tried some natural deodorants before such as Tom&#x27;s but did not get the results i have desired.</li>
      <li>I was starting to think that maybe all the deodorants designed for sensitive skin types don&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>I just started this today and my only complaint is that the lid doesn&#x27;t fit.</li>
      <li>Non irritant and washes off easily with no sticky feeling left behind.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i love the natural products, i love the brand. i do have to apply it more often living in florida and it being summertime</li>
    <li> Horrible. Does not work as well as its competitors for organic deodorant. You will have to reapply a quarter of the way through your day.</li>
    <li> Perfect natural scent that will last 3 hours. Good for days of low physical activity and weather that is 69 degrees Fahrenheit or cooler.</li>
    <li> Good smell but didn&#x27;t provide all day protection.</li>
    <li> Stays on for MOST of the day.  Working in a office for 8 hours, my pits don&#x27;t get much air.  So after that 8 hours, I need to reapply.  With non-vegan deodorant this isn&#x27;t a problem and is something that needs to be overcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the cap is a bit larger than the actual product, so if you&#x27;re putting it loosely into your bag, beware that it may come off.  However I&#x27;ve only purchased once, so this may be a one time defect.</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time and was as described. Unfortunately, it goes on wet and never absorbs. wasn&#x27;t a good odor protector either. It failed within 4hrs.</li>
    <li> This is a nice deodorant and lasts for a long period of time.  However it is not my favorite sent. I love that this is all organic.</li>
    <li> This was my first purchase of natural deodorant.

    <li> Just did not do a good job when sweating.</li>
    <li> I just bought this (7/15/13 @ Earthfare) and unfortunately didn&#x27;t check the ingredient list till I got home (so tiny couldn&#x27;t see it).  At this time, the first ingredient, (ie, most of the product) is: \\&quot;propanediol\\&quot;, which is TOTAL genetically modified from corn syrup.  That&#x27;s going under your armpit, into the lymph area by quick absorption, and running through your system.  They made too much of this stuff a few years back and are now \\&quot;talking\\&quot; everyone into putting in into everything.  Just like the fluoride story.  INTO THE TRASH IT GOES.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t use regular deodorant for very long or I get a rash. I bought this product because I read some pretty good reviews, but it was a big mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good news is that it didn&#x27;t give me a rash.  But it seemed to magnify whatever b.o. was brewing in my armpits by around 1000%. I&#x27;ve had coworkers and friends tell me that this had become a problem for them. When I smelled my clothes at the end of the day, I noticed what they were talking about. It reminded me of sun-ripened moldy produce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so embarrassed that I didn&#x27;t realize this right away and subjected lots of people to this horrible smell! I was starting to think that maybe all the deodorants designed for sensitive skin types don&#x27;t work. But then I tried Tom&#x27;s all natural deodorant (can&#x27;t remember the exact name) and it worked great from the first day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I would advise people to stay away from this terrible product. I hardly ever write reviews for anything I&#x27;ve tried in the past, but this deodorant was so bad I felt the need to warn others about it.</li>
    <li> I love everything about this except that by the end of the day it smells like I didn&#x27;t use anything. I wish I could find something that would work that was non-irritating!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using essential tea tree oil and water in a spray bottle mixture as my deodorant for years because regular deodorant just never cut it. Finally after searching, i came across this tea tree oil deodorant, in solid form, that works. smells good and keeps me smelling good all day. for those complaining that you smell after you sweat, well it&#x27;s not an antiperspirant. i use this combined with my Rx hypercare solution (applied once a night per week) and my problem is solved.</li>
    <li> I like this specific item, Tea Tree &amp; Blue Cyprus, the best. Nice scent and ingredients that are kind to my skin/body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this product information elsewhere...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Provides non-irritating, effective protection to give you that shower-fresh feeling thoughout the day. No propylene glycol, no aluminum chlorohydrate, with baking soda to help neutralize odor, and all vegetable derived ingredients. Our unique formulas contain Certified Organic Extracts of Witch Hazel, Juniper Berry, Echinacea and Rosemary for their odor-controlling properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Vegetable Glycerin, Certified Organic **Lavender and **Rosemary Hydrosol, Sodium Stearate (Vegetable), Steareth-100 (Vegetable), Sodium Bicarbonate (Baking Soda), Glyceryl Stearate (Vegetable), Oleic Acid (Vegetable), Certified Organic Extracts of Witch Hazel*, Juniper Berry*, Echinacea* and Rosemary*; Sodium Chloride (Sea Salt), Ethylhexylglycerin (Vegetable Glycerin), Certified Organic Tea Tree Oil*, Cetyl Alcohol (Vegetable), Stearic Acid (Vegetable), Wild Crafted Blue Cypress Oil, Grapefruit Seed Extract, Pure Essential Oil of Peppermint. **Grown in accordance with the California Organic Foods Act of 1990. *Certified organic by Quality Assurance International. Certified Vegan.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my husband. He threw it away the next day. Didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
    <li> A really nice scent. Been using natural deo for years now and  wanted to try something new. This just didn&#x27;t cover the smell. Best I&#x27;ve found so far is Arm &amp; Hammer.</li>
    <li> First time use. I like it as well as their other deoderants.</li>
    <li> This deodorant has a nice, clean fragrance. The tea tree and cypress make an excellent blend. I do recognize the heady tea tree scent as the main scent with the cypress as an undertone. It does not last for twenty four hours though. I use at least twice a day. A healthier, improved choice as far as I am concerned though. Very pleased with these products. I recommend the chamomile blend as well. It&#x27;s more feminine;)</li>
    <li> I just started this today and my only complaint is that the lid doesn&#x27;t fit. I think Im going to like this. Hopefully the seller well send me a new one since this one came with a messed up top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE- DOES NOT WORK! BUY SOMETHING ELSE!!</li>
    <li> Wish this was stronger. It smells great but it doesn&#x27;t help me any. I used to use the mountain scent from Mitchim and that did the trick until I found out they use aluminum and stopped buying it. Now I use some other organic stuff and its great. If you buy this, I hope you have a light scent.</li>
    <li> I had given up using deodorant because my underarms would itch so badly however this seems to be resolved now that I found this product.  Works well and pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> It smells like mint. Good for the causal setting. However I would not recommend this for sports or anything outdoors does not protect good enough for workouts</li>
    <li> Purchased this when I could not find the NG liquid roll on version. It performs like I didn&#x27;t use any deodorant at all. Like another reviewer here mentioned. I smell okay for about 3 hours and then I notice the odor creeping in. Complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> Been using this brand for about a year and is working out fine for me.</li>
    <li> The scent of the product is nice, but it only lasts for about a hour for me (I&#x27;m a guy) after applying liberally as directed.  No rash or anything happened so that was nice...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: The only Natural deodorant I&#x27;ve found to work for me for at least 6-8h is Arm and Hammer Unscented, unfortunately, it sometimes leaves a rash, and I should probably stop using it...  The search continues.</li>
    <li> The smell is great for about an hour, when the body&#x27;s funk takes over and dominates. I grabbed this specifically for the scent and the lack of aluminum. Wound up swapping back to Degree before i even left the house. It&#x27;s great as a perfume/cologn surrogate but not as a deodorant.</li>
    <li> Smelled really fresh but didn&#x27;t work at all. As a bonus, it acted as an adhesive and I had black sweater fuzz stuck to my not at all fresh armpits when I got home from the office after my first and last day using this product. Oh well.</li>
    <li> but the scent is mostly manly, when i wear it, it smelled garlciky on my skin...nothing wrong with teh product, infact, it is really wonderufl and i like it at least it is organic and natural.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful! Not greasy or over powering with fragrance.  Non irritant and washes off easily with no sticky feeling left behind.</li>
    <li> It smells great, but it isn&#x27;t very long lasting, unfortunately. I sweat a lot, especially when I&#x27;m active, and I find that I stink by the end, moreso than with other deodorants.</li>
    <li> this is the worst product i have purchased, My husband said it doesnt help him with the odor or anything,,,useless ..waste of money..</li>
