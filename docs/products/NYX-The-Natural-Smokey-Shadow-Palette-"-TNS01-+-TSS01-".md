    <li> Not a fan. Colors are too light in the natural</li>
    <li> Everything okay, my wife love it!!!</li>
    <li> Better than my naked palettes!!</li>
    <li> These are lovely colors for eye shadow.  I have spent so much for other bands and the colors and quality were nothing compared to NYX.  The shadow goes on smooth. I use a eye shadow primer and this keeps the color on all day and the color doesn&#x27;t change.  Great product for the price.  It lasts a long time too.</li>
    <li> My little girl ðŸ‘§ 15 years old loves it......</li>
    <li> Fell in love the the natural palette more than the smokey one. I&#x27;ve used it pretty much everyday for the past 6 month and just bought a new one because one color I completely used up.

    <li> Hi ,well I thought the colors were beautiful if blended correctly they &#x27;ll bring the color of your eyes out to a whole other brown ,blue green ,you can go darker and boulder or soften and go a beautiful natural look.....Thank You And Keep-Up The Good Work!!!</li>
    <li> Amazing for the price I paid. Great shadows and I will be trying more NYX products from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw this is the smokey fumes.. I was confused at first when I looked at the picture thinking maybe it was a &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s not.</li>
    <li> This eyeshadow especially natural palette seemed nice. My complexion very tan worked well with this product. There was not much fall out from usage.</li>
    <li> I love them both. Nice selection of color and they stay on very long. I use the natural most though.</li>
    <li> These NYX palettes are so affordable, and the colors are great. I use a MAC paint pot under them to make them last longer. I&#x27;m using the Smokey palette the most.</li>
    <li> The lighter colors do not show up at all.</li>
    <li> the natural looks great. i haven&#x27;t tried the smokey yet, but so far i loved the natural it looks great on my tan skin tone.</li>
    <li> Used the smokey first - the color came on a bit lighter than I had expected. The application was easy if not particularly even toned. Will see if the natural is better</li>
    <li> Really good price for quality makeup</li>
    <li> I never got my palettes, I was so EXCITED when I ordered them April 30, 2014 but unfortunately I never received them! I&#x27;m not sure what happened to them in the process but I wanted to try these out so badly. Glad you all had an opportunity to enjoy yours!</li>
    <li> the colors are very light, i only get to use two out of the 6 colors cause the rest has no pigment, even the white, you cant even tell is on your skin... and im not a white person, im latina. so i wouldnt recomment this.</li>
    <li> Use them everyday love the Smokey Platte just wish they were darker then they word be perfect the natural one is good as a base</li>
    <li> I am in love with Nyx products! Thd eyeshadows are great! Very nicely pigmented and pretty good staying power as long as you use a primer under them.</li>
    <li> Perfect combination! Vary nice for the cost grew to throw in the make up bag</li>
    <li> Small than I though...but very good quality</li>
    <li> The product is ok but not for the price I paid .I could get similar or better for a lot less.</li>
    <li> I have always previously purchased NYX cosmetics from various stores.  One day I was on Amazon and noticed a suggested item of NYX eyewear.  Never thought that I could get it on line.  Now that I have put in my first time online order I will continue to do so, because, I have a very busy schedule and many times I have to wait until I am able to frequent a store that sells this brand. Actually, I think I was shopping to buy some Mac eye shadow and happen to see the suggested NYX product.  I like this brands product.  It applies itself to my skin very smoothly and the colors are come out exactly on my skin tone, as it appears in the package. Of course I must mention the price!  The price is inexpensive, while still delivering quality.  Yes I recommend this brand.  It arrived within a short period of time and I was happy when I received it in the mail.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!!  I get a lot of complements on my eye make up : )</li>
