      <li>Love the entire line of product.</li>
      <li>I have tried just about everything to make my hair more manageable; finally, this is the one!  </li>
      <li>it keeps it soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>I use it after washing and air drying my hair for 20 minutes, and it really helps with frizz and dryness.</li>
      <li>I have very fine/thin hair</li>
      <li>My hair is VERY damaged</li>
      <li>I have very curly hair</li>
      <li>Really makes your hair shine.  </li>

<li> Even though this product isn&#x27;t advertised as a &#x27;leave-in&#x27; product, I try not to rinse it all out, leaving just a little on my hair and then style as usual.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve noticed breakage and the shine was not like usual on her hair.</li>
<li> Gives my hair volume and a silkiness I have never experienced with any other product.  </li>
<li> Not good for black hair!</li>

    <li> The HSI Professional smoothing conditioner has eliminated the fuzz from my hair.  Prior to useing the conditioner my hair was day.  Now is is not dry and is smooth and soft.  I also use it on my face -  dark spots have lighten and my skln is smooth.</li>
    <li> smells awesome and really helps me straighten my hair.</li>
    <li> This conditioner leaves my hair very soft and easy to style. Smells nice too.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product and great smelling</li>
    <li> I usually leave it in overnight, It makes my hair really soft! I was a little worried about the size of the bottle but there&#x27;s actually enough to last through the next moth.</li>
    <li> I mistakenly purchased this item, but it works great!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing ! Will be buying again. Made my hair so soft and healthy . I have thick coarse frizzy hair been using for a few weeks so far and it has helped a lot. I love it.</li>
    <li> I have tried many hair products but this one was by far the best. I use it after washing and air drying my hair for 20 minutes, and it really helps with frizz and dryness. Shipping was on time. Recommended!</li>
    <li> We are trying to buy more clean products and tried both the shampoo and conditioner.  My entire family loves it!  My husband actually commented on how nice it makes his hair feel.  I have a lot less frizz in my hair and it feels softer.  We are loyal customers now!</li>
    <li> Love it. Leave my hair really soft and shiny and due to my curly hair, it doesn&#x27;t always turn out that way. This is a good product for that for sure.</li>
    <li> Smoothing, yes, conditioning, no. I used this for well over a month and my hair was still dry and damaged. But yes it felt smooth. I would recommend Cantu Shea Butter leave in conditioner. It truly makes your hair healthier, softer, tangle free, and even stopped my breakage from all my processing.</li>
    <li> best conditioner I have yet tried, and a little goes a long ways..</li>
    <li> Love the entire line of product. Very nice</li>
    <li> Had I realized it had silicone in it, I would not have purchased it. There are three separate silicone ingredients in the conditioner. Even the HSI thermal spray has silicone. Everything with silicone will make your hair smooth and soft but it isn&#x27;t necessarily good for your hair and the only way to remove it is with sulfate shampoo.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing conditioner! Totally moisturizers and leaves my hair super soft!</li>
    <li> Love it.  I bought this 3 times.  Really makes your hair shine.  Easy to use too.</li>
    <li> Best conditioner ever !! I have long hair and it knots up a lot this is great for combing out knots up...</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, my hair feels so soft and not tangled after blow drying.</li>
    <li> Excellent hair conditioner.  This product makes my hair less frizzy and feeling healthier.  I&#x27;ve been complimented several times on the smell as well which is an added bonus.</li>
    <li> Smooth, less frizzy hair!</li>
    <li> I have very fine/thin hair so it doesn&#x27;t take much usage of so-so products (yes, even sulfate-free) to make my hair dry and brittle.  This conditioner is outstanding.  Gives my hair volume and a silkiness I have never experienced with any other product.  Even though this product isn&#x27;t advertised as a &#x27;leave-in&#x27; product, I try not to rinse it all out, leaving just a little on my hair and then style as usual.  Shine, volume and silkiness abound!  Well worth the price although I don&#x27;t find this product to be hugely expensive either.</li>
    <li> Takes the frizz out of my granddaughters long hair.  Love it</li>
    <li> I wish I could say better things about the HSI Conditioner and Shampoo but I did not have a good experience after finishing the bottle. My hair is VERY damaged so I tried to base it on my 7yr old daughter who has beautiful long thick hair and in the past month since using these 2 I&#x27;ve noticed breakage and the shine was not like usual on her hair. Very disappointing, I was really hoping with all the good reviews it would work well for me but after it not working on both our hair I will not buy again.</li>
    <li> My new favorite. Hair feels silky soft. Just right.</li>
    <li> Great conditioner!  I have extremely thick and course hair, and after using this product, people are asking me &amp;#34;What have you done to your hair?  It looks wonderful.&amp;#34;  I have tried just about everything to make my hair more manageable; finally, this is the one!  I never want to be without this conditioner again.</li>
    <li> This product left my hair feeling silky, very soft and smooth. It also cut down on the frizziness. It also smells good.</li>
    <li> Have been using this and the Argan oil for a few months now and couldn&#x27;t be happier. Smells great, makes my hair smooth and shiny. I am an AA female and love this product!</li>
    <li> Wow! What can I say... By far the best shampoo I&#x27;ve used to wash my hair! Nothing can compare to this product. The best thing about it, to me, probably, is the scent. It is so intoxicating. I don&#x27;t know how to describe it but... it&#x27;s heavenly.</li>
    <li> Just another overpriced conditioner. They all seem to work the same.</li>
    <li> Good product but expesive</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s beautifull product it makes the hair soft it controls frizzy hair and its perfect with my straightener I love it</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> Nothing fabulous for my hair.  I will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t the greatest like they make it sound</li>
    <li> Horrible shampoo/conditioner. There is nothing &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; about this product. It left my hair a mess! I will contact Costumer service and see if I can return it.</li>
    <li> it is my second bottle of HSI products, highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner! My hair is as soft and smooth as it is after a salon deep treatment.</li>
    <li> I can honestly say that this is the best conditioner I have ever tried and I have probably tried almost all of them. HSI has proven that an excellent product can improve my hair&#x27;s condition.  The HSI shampoo was excellent when I applied it to my hair because my hair felt soft while shampooing and was not tangled even before I put the conditioner on.  The only drawback is I don&#x27;t know if I can afford this product every time.  It is pretty expensive!</li>
    <li> THE BEST THING THAT EVER HAPPENED TO MY HAIR.  My hair is curly and super dry due to excessive coloring. Since I&#x27;m using the HSI Professional conditioner, my hair looks healthier, soft and shine. I use it everyday. Anyone that have hair issues should try it.&lt;br /&gt;I love it and will buy more to have a good supply.</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing product! My hair has never been so healthy</li>
    <li> The product is great- I have very curly hair but like to straighten it. This helps with that- it keeps it soft and smooth. The product was delivered as promised. No complaints!</li>
    <li> This product made a differentin my hair, soft, easy to comb, smell nice</li>
    <li> Has sulfates! Not good for black hair!</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> some not so healthy ingredients on the list. Product should contain a full description. Would not have purchased if I had known.</li>
