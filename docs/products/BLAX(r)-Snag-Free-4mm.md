### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>AMAZING!!!</li>
      <li>Best of all, my hair is not damaged by these.</li>
      <li>Excellent product at the best price I have found here at Amazon.</li>
      <li>Awesome.  </li>
      <li>These match my hair and look great.</li>
      <li>If not then I&#x27;m a happy camper...</li>
      <li>Ordering more now!!</li>
      <li>She said these were definitely a good purchase.  </li>
      <li>But they&#x27;re good.</li>
      <li>These match the color of my hair fairly well</li>
      <li>I like the 2mm bands best as they are a bit more flexible and more like a \\&quot;rubber band\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>Love these!</li>
      <li>The product is great and arrived quickly!</li>
      <li>Thanks for making me look brilliant!</li>
      <li>Best to slide off gently.</li>
      <li>The do not slip off your hair and are very easy to use.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d seen the Blax hair elastics mentioned in magazines before, but wasn&#x27;t sure if they&#x27;d be as amazing as they were supposed to be.  </li>
      <li>I also don&#x27;t think these can be reused too many times before their life span is met.</li>
      <li>I love them.</li>
      <li>/&gt;They keep your hair up in a ponytail with no drooping, which I&#x27;ve never been able to accomplish before.  </li>
      <li>I wish they were priced a bit better</li>
      <li>I love how these don&#x27;t pull my hair</li>
      <li>Fantastic!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so excited to have found these!</li>
      <li>heck I just wanted then to hold the hair for a full day.&lt;br /&gt;Hallelujah for Blaxx!</li>
      <li>These on the other hand are perfect.</li>
      <li>They slid out Farley easily and do not pull the hair.</li>
      <li>I also love that when you get them they say $4 right on the package and you pay much more than that here.</li>
      <li>(light brown)</li>
      <li>I finally ordered them -- and they really are the best hair</li>
      <li>These are worth the price!  </li>
      <li>, they are pricey for what you get, but they are definitely worth it!</li>
      <li>Came quickly.</li>
      <li>These things are smooth and hold very well.  </li>
      <li>and they fall right out.  </li>
      <li>Great product, and they do not feel like they are on the border of breaking every second like traditional elastic bands, or fabric covered ones.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t loose their shapes and hold hair nicely.  </li>
      <li>I bought them because I saw that they were top-rated in a magazine for not hurting your hair, great for thick hair, etc</li>
      <li>These elastics are some of the only ones I&#x27;ve found that don&#x27;t stretch out and break after one use - or even after many uses.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t expect that haha.</li>
      <li>They feel gentle on the hair and really do &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; off.</li>
      <li>Very versatile, when I run out, I will be reordering.</li>
      <li>No snagging or pulling and a lot of stretch have not broken on yet.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really like them.</li>
      <li>but they really hold the hair...</li>
      <li>They were easy to lose and stretched out.</li>
      <li>I have long, fine hair</li>
      <li>They hold it all up and in place and slide right out, strong and long lasting!</li>
      <li>I liked the clear ones but after a few months they hardened and broke or cracked.  </li>
      <li>The only thing I wish were different was that it was slightly more stretchy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing that these really don&#x27;t pull when they come out of hair, but I can&#x27;t seem to get it tight enough to hold my waist length hair in a high pony.  </li>
      <li>When I put my hair into a pony tail I like to be able to pull the elastic up a little so my hair will slip out easier.</li>
      <li>The only hair band worth keeping track of and not letting the cats play with.</li>
      <li>I think the plain silky covered elastic bands work better for me.</li>
      <li>These 4mm bands will only go around my hair twice as I can&#x27;t stretch them very much.  </li>
      <li>These are exactly the same as the ones that used to be sold at Sephora.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m tempted to get another pack and even try the clear.</li>
      <li>I use both these and the clear</li>
      <li>Hmm well first of all I have very long hair</li>
      <li>I usually only have to buy more because my daughter borrows them and loses them.</li>
      <li>Trouble is, when they did finally wear out the silicone hair ties available barely lasted a day in a ponytail!</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re also too tight to wear on the wrist, so I have them everywhere (but never can seem to find one right when I need it).</li>

<li> My oldest daughter has thick hair that is hard to hold, she loves these hairbands, no ripping her hair out or tangling.  </li>
<li> I like it, However, for my hair type; thick and curly, these bands would get stuck.</li>
<li> These don&#x27;t pull my hair out, but hold my thick hair in place.  </li>
<li> but if I braid my hair then it&#x27;s impossible to get them small enough</li>
<li> These are small!</li>
<li> I like the usual covered elastic bands but after a bit they stretch out or fray or basically become totally useless.  </li>
<li> After going through may different hair ties and headbands a friend recommended these to me, and I have not been disappointed by them yet.</li>
<li> These are too thin to do that</li>
<li> They are also thin so there is no bulk.</li>
<li> Too thin.</li>
<li> and I hate doing that because it always causes breakage!</li>

    <li> Came quickly. Does snag hair when removing</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing that these really don&#x27;t pull when they come out of hair, but I can&#x27;t seem to get it tight enough to hold my waist length hair in a high pony.  They&#x27;re also too tight to wear on the wrist, so I have them everywhere (but never can seem to find one right when I need it).</li>
    <li> Wish they packaged and sold these in a small jar or tub.  I use them every day.</li>
    <li> Hmm well first of all I have very long hair so I&#x27;m always in the hunt for something that won&#x27;t pull it out or catch in it.  I like the usual covered elastic bands but after a bit they stretch out or fray or basically become totally useless.  So, I decided to try these after reading about them.  I like the 2mm bands best as they are a bit more flexible and more like a \\&quot;rubber band\\&quot;.  These 4mm bands will only go around my hair twice as I can&#x27;t stretch them very much.  That works ok at the base of my ponytail but if I braid my hair then it&#x27;s impossible to get them small enough and they fall right out.  I actually find them similar in feeling to the \\&quot;clear\\&quot; bands you can buy at walmart or wherever.  I liked the clear ones but after a few months they hardened and broke or cracked.  I&#x27;ll see if that happens to these.  If not then I&#x27;m a happy camper... we&#x27;ll see how long it lasts...</li>
    <li> AMAZING!!! These are exactly the same as the ones that used to be sold at Sephora. Goody and Scuncii also used to make similar products, but what they offer now is a cheep imitation. I have very long thick hair and these are the only thing that work. They hold it all up and in place and slide right out, strong and long lasting! I&#x27;m so excited to have found these! Ordering more now!!</li>
    <li> Love these! The do not slip off your hair and are very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I like these hair ties a lot.  I used to use the clear ones, but I would lose them all the time because you can&#x27;t see them once you set them down!  These match the color of my hair fairly well (light brown), so I will be purchasing these from now on.</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t pull my hair out, but hold my thick hair in place.  I find they work better on course or dirty hair and not clean or straight hair.</li>
    <li> These elastics are some of the only ones I&#x27;ve found that don&#x27;t stretch out and break after one use - or even after many uses. I usually only have to buy more because my daughter borrows them and loses them. I have long, fine hair and they don&#x27;t snag or break my hair. If you pull them off and let them roll, they will wrap your hair around them. Best to slide off gently.</li>
    <li> I do not recommend. I know everyone else loves them...I bought them because I saw that they were top-rated in a magazine for not hurting your hair, great for thick hair, etc...but these were just not what I was looking for (and not as pictured, btw). I was looking for a bigger ponytail holder and these are small. I did not get what I ordered, and of course, since these are third party, I know there is nothing I can do about it but give them to someone else. I also love that when you get them they say $4 right on the package and you pay much more than that here. Awesome.  Definitely not for thick hair. And they hurt!</li>
    <li> My oldest daughter has thick hair that is hard to hold, she loves these hairbands, no ripping her hair out or tangling.  She said these were definitely a good purchase.  Thanks for making me look brilliant!</li>
    <li> As a dude who has long hair it sometimes a challenge to find hair products. After going through may different hair ties and headbands a friend recommended these to me, and I have not been disappointed by them yet. No snagging or pulling and a lot of stretch have not broken on yet.</li>
    <li> I like it, However, for my hair type; thick and curly, these bands would get stuck.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Blax hair elastic a for quite a while and like them a lot. I have long hair and a daily yoga practice so I am constantly securing or braiding my hair. The ones I had previously were 2mm and clear. They were easy to lose and stretched out. These on the other hand are perfect. The brown color matches mine and they hold my hair without pulling it. I like the no frills of them, no attachments or frou-frou to annoy me. Excellent product at the best price I have found here at Amazon.</li>
    <li> Too thin. When I put my hair into a pony tail I like to be able to pull the elastic up a little so my hair will slip out easier. These are too thin to do that and I had to pull it through the length of my hair and I hate doing that because it always causes breakage!</li>
    <li> Only wish they were thicker.</li>
    <li> I saw these peeking out of my sister&#x27;s make-up drawer, and decided I should get some too. I love the ease of actual elastics, but hate the look of clear ones. These match my hair and look great. I feel polished enough while sporting one of these to wear them to work. Great product, and they do not feel like they are on the border of breaking every second like traditional elastic bands, or fabric covered ones.</li>
    <li> Once upon a time I bought a big bag of silicone hair ties at the drug store that were durable enough to wear time and time again. Trouble is, when they did finally wear out the silicone hair ties available barely lasted a day in a ponytail! Since then I&#x27;ve been searching for reusable hair ties, heck I just wanted then to hold the hair for a full day.&lt;br /&gt;Hallelujah for Blaxx! Not only can I wear them day in, day out but they really hold the hair... Even my layers that just make it into the band. Best of all, my hair is not damaged by these. They slid out Farley easily and do not pull the hair. I wish they were priced a bit better so I could offer them to my salon clients. Guess I need to find a wholesaler so I can retail them.</li>
    <li> The only hair band worth keeping track of and not letting the cats play with.</li>
    <li> These are worth the price!  They don&#x27;t loose their shapes and hold hair nicely.  There&#x27;s not many in a pack so I guard them!  I&#x27;ve been looking for brown elastic hair ties and I will look no further.  I&#x27;m tempted to get another pack and even try the clear.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d seen the Blax hair elastics mentioned in magazines before, but wasn&#x27;t sure if they&#x27;d be as amazing as they were supposed to be.  I finally ordered them -- and they really are the best hair elastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They keep your hair up in a ponytail with no drooping, which I&#x27;ve never been able to accomplish before.  (I&#x27;ve tried the \\&quot;bungee-style\\&quot; ponytail holders, but I can&#x27;t get those to stay either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also don&#x27;t snag or grab your hair when you take them out, and they also don&#x27;t cause a ponytail headache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, they are pricey for what you get, but they are definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> I purchased these after reading they don&#x27;t damage hair. I don&#x27;t really like them. I feel like they stretch out after only a few uses and I did have hair come out with them. I think the plain silky covered elastic bands work better for me.</li>
    <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t snag with these, which was why I bought them. Other bands were ripping my hair. The only thing I wish were different was that it was slightly more stretchy. Sometimes I want to wrap it one more time for snugness, but I&#x27;m afraid of breaking it. I also don&#x27;t think these can be reused too many times before their life span is met.</li>
    <li> The product is great and arrived quickly!</li>
    <li> These things are smooth and hold very well.  They do eventually wear out, so I consider them to be somewhat disposable, but it takes several wears before that happens.  I love them.</li>
    <li> I like these.  I bought these because I read in a magazine that they don&#x27;t leave dents in your hair.  My experience is they do - but I still like them.  I have fine, thin long hair and perhaps this is the case with this type of hair.  What I like about them is that they stay put, not sliding, no coming out - even when I sleep with a ponytail.  They are also thin so there is no bulk.</li>
    <li> Fantastic! I use both these and the clear</li>
    <li> These are small! I didn&#x27;t expect that haha. But they&#x27;re good. Still ripped hair out of my head. But maybe it&#x27;s because I should have bought a bigger size.</li>
    <li> These work - and I have the biggest head curly unruly hair! I can use these for a bun, or for when I am doing braids etc. They feel gentle on the hair and really do &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; off. Very versatile, when I run out, I will be reordering.</li>
    <li> I love how these don&#x27;t pull my hair and you can&#x27;t see them, since my hair is the same color.</li>
