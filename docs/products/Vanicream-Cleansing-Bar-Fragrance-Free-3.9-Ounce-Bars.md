    <li> See Free and Clear shampoo comment</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this line of soap and lotion.  I was doubtful at first but am pleased.  I use this soap in the shower and for my face.  It&#x27;s great.  No stinky smell, works great.</li>
    <li> This cleansing bar is great! Very happy with results. Make the skin very soft. I will purchase this product again!</li>

    <li> Recommended by my dermatologist and is working great. Very nice product. Would recommend to others who has sensitive skin. Soothing to the skin.</li>
    <li> Products are WONDERFUL! Soap is great for dry skin. Cream works best if used right out of the shower on wet skin.....need very little and there is no greasy after effects. Dr. Recommended these products, I am more than satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;Order arrived on time.</li>
    <li> I HAVE TRIED ALMOST EVERYTHING I COULD FIND IN THE STORES AND NOTHING COMPARES TO THIS CLEANSING BAR. USE TO SCRATCH ALL DAY AND ALL NIGHT NOW HARDLY EVER SINCE I STARTED USING THE CLEANSING BAR AND I MEAN HARDLY EVER. ARMS AND LEGS ARE CLEARING UP AND I&#x27;M ABLE TO GET A GOOD NIGHTS SLEEP.</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap because of sensitive skin and eczema conditions on my hands.  It is very gentle and has no dyes or fragrances.  I am very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> So please I found this product!  I have very sensitive skin and couldn&#x27;t find anything that didn&#x27;t make me feel itchy or just feel terrible after I used it because of all the crap being put in products today.  My skin feels nice and clean after bathing with the Vanicream  Bar .  And I have no bad reaction to it at all.  LOVE it!  Going to stock up.  I have ordered it twice now..</li>
    <li> I was told about Vanicream by a friend so I decided to try it for myself because I have very sensitive skin and it gets really dry in the winter months.I brought this product on Amazon and absolutely loved it. This cleansing bar smells great and fresh and left my skin feeing really refreshed and clean after I used it. It can be used on a daily basis and doesn&#x27;t dry the skin out. It really felt soft to the touch and I could see how clean my skin was when I looked in the mirror. It comes in a four pack which is great so it lasts for quite awhile and I can use it on my children&#x27;s skin as well.&lt;br /&gt;After using this product for awhile I noticed my skin was clearer and brighter. The texture of my skin improved. I would definitely recommend this product to friends or to anyone that has sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Use all Vanicream products as recommended by my dermatologist.  No more skin problems!  No more redness or dry skin.</li>
    <li> This soap is great for dry, sensitive skin.  It cleans without irritating my skin.  Also, product arrived quickly and at a good price.</li>
    <li> I should have had it combined with order for three bars earlier, consequently I paid a lot for shipping this single bar.&lt;br /&gt;My fault.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RWY</li>
    <li> My husband has sensitive skin &amp; uses this with no problems. He used to have rashes from several products, and this gives him no rashes. I don&#x27;t use it because a) I don&#x27;t need to, and b) I don&#x27;t like that there&#x27;s no lather. It feels &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; to me. But the lathering elements are probably exactly what give people skin sensitivity. So there you go. I recommend this if you have allergies or sensitivities.</li>
    <li> Excellent  if you have sensitive skin or a lot of allergies.</li>
