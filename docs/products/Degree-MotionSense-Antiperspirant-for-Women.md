      <li>A very strong, cheap perfume smell.</li>

      <li>I live overseas now and still order this as the deodorants here just don&#x27;t cut it here.</li>
      <li>It does last the full 24 hours it boasts on regular days, however not when I workout/play sports.  </li>
      <li>It was a bit smaller than I expected but did fit the price paid.</li>
      <li>I still smelled fresh whereas with my other deodorant</li>
      <li>I only wish it was clear.</li>

    <li> Love this, works great in my high-stress hospital job environment!  Nice fresh scent, too.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this deodorant. It works for me.</li>
    <li> GREAT deodorant, only brand+type me and my roommate EVER use/buy!!</li>
    <li> Great item, great price, great shipping from a great dealer.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> This is the best antiperspirant I have used hands down.  Especially after workouts and after long days.  Not messy, very pleasant but not overpowering scent.</li>
    <li> Ugh. The scent is too strong and follows you around all day. Coworkers can smell it. A very strong, cheap perfume smell. No thank you! I threw mine away.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because it looked like the one I had that I couldn&#x27;t find at Walmart. The one I received was not the &amp;#34;expert protection&amp;#34; and the active ingredient % is different than the one I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Very fresh aroma, maybe a little overwhelming to some but not at all offensive to my &#x27;smeller&#x27;. It was a bit smaller than I expected but did fit the price paid. I think those who have been satisfied with the normal sea breezes and clean linen will find this uniquely different. My recommendation.</li>
    <li> This deodorant totally keeps you from getting musty!!! This is some good stuff!! And it smells so good!! While I was at work, a customer asked me what type of perfume I had on because I smelled good! Lol!! I&#x27;m like ohh, its called deodorant! lol</li>
    <li> I got a fantastic deal on this dual pack of Degree Deodorant using the coupon on the coupon page! It smells smells great and lasts long! I feel comfortable all day while wearing this. :D</li>
    <li> Not sure what they changed when they changed the label, but this does not work like it used to! I had to switch to a different brand because it would not last me all day anymore. It used to last me over a day! Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love this product and it has a clean fresh scent that is not overpowering. The two pack is very convenient as well.</li>
    <li> My favorite deodorant. Smells nice and works super well. Doesn&#x27;t get on clothes either</li>
    <li> This is SERIOUSLY the BEST &amp;#34;D-O&amp;#34; for  the&amp;#34;B-O&amp;#34;! Not only does if work wonders but it smells sooo good! I am a full time mommy of our (1st child) beautiful baby girl who is 8 months old and on the move. She loves to run me around and without this AMAZING deodorant i would be...let&#x27;s just say stinky and sweaty lol. I definitely recommend it to any woman on the move or not. Another amazing thing is that there is NO RESIDUE! I hope you give it a try and that it works for your as it does for me! GOD BLESS XOXO</li>
    <li> this lasts all day and the scent is just heaven. keeps you dry all day. i would recommend to anyone</li>
    <li> Works!  What more can I say?!</li>
    <li> Incredible price compared to drug stores. Good deoderant. No need for the overpriced fancy kind.</li>
    <li> Being a long time user of Degree deoderants, I&#x27;m psyched about this new scent.  It works well with my body chemistry and blends with my other scented products.  It does last the full 24 hours it boasts on regular days, however not when I workout/play sports.  All in all it&#x27;s a great product &amp; I&#x27;ll continue to use it.  And I LOVE the subscribe &amp; save option and pricing.</li>
    <li> Works awesome and smells good</li>
    <li> Great product if you are active. I live overseas now and still order this as the deodorants here just don&#x27;t cut it here.</li>
    <li> This is my daughter&#x27;s favorite brand. She says that it works better than anything else and the scent is perfect for her.</li>
    <li> I sweat pretty good for a woman and this really keeps it under control. I only wish it was clear.</li>
    <li> I normally use Secret, but didn&#x27;t want to use it so much in became ineffective.  This takes care of the wetness, but does nothing for odor control.  Ended up in the trash.</li>
    <li> I am a sweater and need something and didn&#x27;t want to continue to use a clinical one because it never came off.  I have good and bad days with this where it works great and some when I am reapplying all day!</li>
    <li> Love this scent of degree deodorant and product has always done well. A++++++ in my book.</li>
    <li> Fine product. It was received when expected. This rating is only for scent.  Too much baby powder smell in the scent.</li>
    <li> I purchased this deodorant because my current deodorant (secret) wasn&#x27;t working as well anymore. I&#x27;ve worked out three times with this deodorant on (ran on the treadmill for several miles and went on a run outside) and I could tell this product was working. I still smelled fresh whereas with my other deodorant, I would start to smell. It glides on my underarms smoothIy with absolutely no irritation or burning would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a while now, and continue to like it very well.  Nice scent and clear when put on.  Would recommend</li>
