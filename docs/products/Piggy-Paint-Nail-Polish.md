### Positive Reviews

      <li>I&#x27;m really impressed with the quality of these paints.</li>
      <li>Perfect accompaniment for the Piggy Paint Polish.  </li>
      <li>Use the 4 step application process for best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This stuff works great!  </li>
      <li>Saw the excellent ratings by EWG and decided to give it a try.</li>
      <li>I was impressed!  </li>
      <li>Great item - just as pictured!</li>
      <li>Its great if you want to paint your nails for a couple days.</li>
      <li>GREAT product.  </li>
      <li>My no color manicure hasn&#x27;t even chipped in 9 days, and my colored pedicure still looks great too.</li>
      <li>All in all another good product by piggy paint even if it doesn&#x27;t seem as non toxic as the rest.</li>
      <li>be fair</li>
      <li>This primer and top coat make all the difference!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Then I found myself using her piggy paint for my own nails since I was expecting and didn&#x27;t want to use my own nail polish.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it would act as a nail strengthener all on its own, however.&lt;br /&gt;4.  </li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s more suitable for kids.</li>
      <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t have chemicals</li>
      <li>Love, love the topcoat.</li>
      <li>If you follow the directions and avoid too many layers of colored polish, the results will not disappoint.  </li>
      <li>Be sure to cover tips of nails.</li>
      <li>Seal (apply Basecoat + Sealer on top of Topcoat for extended wear.</li>
      <li>But the girls love to put it on</li>

      <li>However we still love it because of the lack of odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t worry about what&#x27;s touching their skin.</li>
      <li>My polish lasts for most of the week now.</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t be getting any more of this.</li>
      <li>piggy polish, then the top coat.</li>
      <li>Glad I found the two pack...</li>
      <li>It is already much better, so this will probably be a 5 star product for me.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t try the top coat yet...</li>
      <li>Make sure the paint is shaken thoroughly before use.</li>
      <li>I did brush some top coat on one of my fingers before being overcome by the smell</li>

      <li>I bought this product along with some piggy paint polish because I am pregnant and needed a very safe alternative for nail polish.</li>
      <li>, I like how easy it is to use, and I LOVE the way it doesn&#x27;t smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I was happy to accept it for the sake of its natural ingredients.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve found the Piggy Paints with some sparkle go on more smoothly, e.g. All that Razz</li>
      <li>But after that it chips off easily.</li>
      <li>As a NON beauty-queen I can vouch that this is quite easy to use</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to remove from the surrounding skin and cuticle if you miss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is super strong, use two coats.</li>
      <li>Now, if you&#x27;d like to know how to ruin a perfectly good manicure of any kind in 2 days or less, I could probably talk you through that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is nice that this is better for me, which is the only reason I purchased it.</li>
      <li>I am loving it so far.</li>
      <li>and Sometimes Sweet.</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, the problem is that it does not do any good in terms of making it last.</li>
      <li>far as the finish goes - both my daughter and I were initially thrilled with the Piggy Paint products.  </li>
      <li>It works fine if you just buff your nails first.</li>
      <li>I was painting my toddler&#x27;s nails with piggy paint, but it would come off so quickly.</li>
      <li>natural nail polish remover that is supposed to work with this product didn&#x27;t work, NOTHING WORKED!!!!!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like spending so much on nail polish, but safety is important to me.</li>
      <li>The top coat looks opaque in the bottle, but dries as clear and shiny as you could ever want.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It dries pretty quickly as well</li>
      <li>Extra shine top coat.</li>
      <li>I asked my husband to smell it to see if it was just my pregnancy nose, and sure enough, he revolted too when he took a whiff.</li>
      <li>I chose this product because of its very low score on EWG&#x27;s SkinDeep list and I&#x27;m glad I did</li>
      <li>I think it is pretty harmless for a cosmetic product</li>
      <li>so make sure it is mixed well.</li>
      <li>and the polish and base/top coats have no weird smells to them.</li>
      <li>Piggy Paint fills chips better than regular sinceit</li>
      <li>I love piggy paint polish does what it says, however the brush sucks, very cheap plastic material for the price you pay</li>
      <li>Makes kids feel super special with the extra touch!</li>
      <li>You do have to make sure to follow the directions and dry each coat in between with a hair dryer.  </li>
      <li>It certainly extends the life of the polish.</li>
      <li>Any bumps will show as the polish dries unlike enamel which can really glop on and</li>
      <li>Very shiny, rivals my others but lasts longer.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Dries fast.</li>
      <li>I love that it is non toxic, but it did come out way faster than expected.</li>
      <li>I really had to scrub at my nails to get the paint to come off.</li>
      <li>It is very sticky.</li>
      <li>This polish doesn&#x27;t self-level like enamels so do not not use too much.</li>
      <li>I used an Essie color in between the coats and it stayed shiny the whole time.</li>
      <li>/&gt;These have survived their first day, but I really don&#x27;t have enough data points to give you a good idea of how this might last, and I may never wrack up enough of those to feel qualified!</li>
      <li>If you follow instructions it does last significantly longer than just piggy paint color by itself.  </li>
      <li>I bought her a set of piggy paint nail polish and based on the reviews that were saying that it does not last a long time on its own</li>
      <li>Between polish coats, blow dry polished nails on warm heat, low blower setting.</li>
      <li>Keep the nails short - like regular polish longer nails leads to more pressure and chips.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I shower frequently and didn&#x27;t expect a positive experience.</li>
      <li>have to rate any piggy paint polish high because it&#x27;s the safest option (in my opinion and experience)</li>
      <li>and I feel safe applying it on my daughters little finger</li>
      <li>but I would not have wasted my money on this product if I had checked it out more....</li>
      <li>Even though it&#x27;s four coats, each one dries in a fraction of the time that a normal nail polish takes.</li>
      <li>It generally looks and lasts better than my other premium polishes.</li>
      <li>Also, my nail beds under the clear polish are nice and pink, and the clear polish hasn&#x27;t turned yellow.</li>
      <li>Looks like new every time unlike when I try to fix chips with enamel.</li>
      <li>I actually had parts of my nail polish that wouldn&#x27;t come off with nail polish remover with the first go.</li>
      <li>To get a smooth finish, use less paint.</li>
      <li>colors both basically went on clear</li>
      <li>Beige 31 Water-Based Nail Polish]], which is quite nice, as the Suncoat top coat and base coat are pricier.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is pricy considering how frequently you would have to reapply if you like your nails</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised at how well these products work.</li>
      <li>I have done this but also been too busy to do it</li>
      <li>This really makes the piggy paint last.</li>
      <li>However, if you do have problems with chemical sensitivities I would stay far away from this stuff.</li>
      <li>I only paint my daughters toes (she&#x27;s 3), but I noticed with this her paint stays on much longer</li>
      <li>no matter what remover you use (natural or not)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I was skeptical on buying this, but I was tired of my natural nail polish wearing off right after I did my nails.  This stuff works great!  You do have to make sure to follow the directions and dry each coat in between with a hair dryer.  If you follow the directions and avoid too many layers of colored polish, the results will not disappoint.  My nail polish lasted for a few days.  In fact, it was a bit of a pain to get off afterwards!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m here to tell you that:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  This doesn&#x27;t stink.  Yaaaaay!&lt;br /&gt;2.  As a NON beauty-queen I can vouch that this is quite easy to use&lt;br /&gt;3.  The basecoat looks clear in the bottle, but dries very matte and slightly opaque.  I don&#x27;t know if it would act as a nail strengthener all on its own, however.&lt;br /&gt;4.  The top coat looks opaque in the bottle, but dries as clear and shiny as you could ever want.&lt;br /&gt;5.  It works well with [[ASIN:B000WR92BO Suncoat Products Beige 31 Water-Based Nail Polish]], which is quite nice, as the Suncoat top coat and base coat are pricier.&lt;br /&gt;6.  The base coat stayed on just fine for 24 hours before I got around to doing the rest.&lt;br /&gt;7.  It&#x27;s easy to remove from the surrounding skin and cuticle if you miss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s it!  I like the way it looks, I like how easy it is to use, and I LOVE the way it doesn&#x27;t smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sorry I don&#x27;t feel qualified to speak about wear.  Not only have I only used this for a day, and with a different brand of unusual product, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d ever feel qualified to talk about how nails wear.  Now, if you&#x27;d like to know how to ruin a perfectly good manicure of any kind in 2 days or less, I could probably talk you through that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These have survived their first day, but I really don&#x27;t have enough data points to give you a good idea of how this might last, and I may never wrack up enough of those to feel qualified!</li>
    <li> Great item - just as pictured!</li>
    <li> I bought this to try since I have chemical sensitivities and this stuff smells AWFUL! I personally think it smells worse than traditional nail polish. There is no way it&#x27;s &amp;#34;virtually odorless&amp;#34;.  I was hoping for something that I could tolerate but I can&#x27;t handle this.  I did brush some top coat on one of my fingers before being overcome by the smell and I don&#x27;t know how to explain it, but it looked like it evaporated as I put it on. It&#x27;s goes on very, very thin. My nail looked the same as before I put it on.  Even if I didn&#x27;t have problems with scents, I wouldn&#x27;t use this. However, if you do have problems with chemical sensitivities I would stay far away from this stuff.</li>
    <li> My little daughter got interested in nail polishes and I could not offer her the smelly toxic ones. Piggy paint is among the few non toxic natural options that are on the market if you want to avoid those regular brands. I bought her a set of piggy paint nail polish and based on the reviews that were saying that it does not last a long time on its own I added the make it last set to my order as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who want to know the ingredients: The base coat ( clear one) is methoxy propanol which is an alcohol derivative. It is hard to call it as natural as mud ( what it says on the tube) since it is a documented irritant but at least, if not swallowed it does not cause long term health effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The top coat ( milk colored one) is a solution containing TRIMETHYL HYDROXYPENTYL ISOBUTYRATE ( considered as safe by Environmental Working Group: EWG), aqua, polyethylene ( also safe according to EWG) and neem oil ( a sort of vegetable oil(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I think it is pretty harmless for a cosmetic product and I feel safe applying it on my daughters little finger nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the problem is that it does not do any good in terms of making it last. I applied two sets of base coat and three sets of the nail polish, followed by another two sets of top coat with adequate waiting times in between. After all this hassle and using these pretty expensive products the result was that it started getting chipped within 36 hours and three days later a few of the nails were totally blank. 6 days later it was almost impossible to say that these nails were polished at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in my book, this is a non satisfactory result. I was expecting this nail polish to under-perform anyways but I was happy to accept it for the sake of its natural ingredients. However, I can not accept the under-performance of this additional &#x27;make it last&#x27; product. If you can not make it last longer, which obviously is the case, then don&#x27;t just sell it...</li>
    <li> This worked really well for us to help make Piggy Paint manicures last.  First I lightly buffed her nails, then applied basecoat, then three thin coats of Piggy Polish with 30 seconds of blow dryer between each one, then the topcoat.  It lasted 5-6 days before my daughter started picking it off herself from the cuticle side but didn&#x27;t chip off at the tips.  I was impressed!  Definitely worth the trouble and expense if you are wanting non-toxic personal care products.</li>
    <li> Its great if you want to paint your nails for a couple days. But after that it chips off easily. Still looking for a non toxic nail polish that lasts at least 5-6 days.</li>
    <li> Not sure.....used the base coat, it has a smell to it, but looks like water and has the consistency of water.  When I applied it to my nails it dried quick and then looked like I had nothing on my nails...maybe that&#x27;s how it suppose to be..??&lt;br /&gt;To be fair I didn&#x27;t try the top coat yet...but as far as the base coat goes I&#x27;m not impressed.</li>
    <li> I bought this product along with some piggy paint polish because I am pregnant and needed a very safe alternative for nail polish. I used the base and topcoat with my first application, and it smelled AWFUL! The smell of the basecoat is worse than the smell of regular nail polish AND it burned when I painted it on my bare nails. I asked my husband to smell it to see if it was just my pregnancy nose, and sure enough, he revolted too when he took a whiff. EW! Furthermore, nothing I used to try to take this nail polish and topcoat off worked!! Acetone didn&#x27;t work, the soy based natural nail polish remover that is supposed to work with this product didn&#x27;t work, NOTHING WORKED!!!!! I had to scrape the nail polish off my nail beds with a cuticle pusher and it tore up my nails badly. It was either that or go to a black tie event with badly chipped hot pink nails. I will never be buying piggy paint again and will never use it again. DO yourself a favor and DON&#x27;T BUY! I bought Priti NYC nail polish which is just as safe and chemical-free and it comes off like a charm no matter what remover you use (natural or not) and the polish and base/top coats have no weird smells to them.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how well these products work. I am going to keep buying Piggy Paint products for my girls!</li>
    <li> Saw the excellent ratings by EWG and decided to give it a try. Love it! I only use base and top coat to keep my nails shiny (no colored nail polish), and this works very well for that.</li>
    <li> The base and top coats go on very easily and dry in a jiffy.  They are very low odor.  My daughter loves them and I have taken to using them as I can&#x27;t stand the smell of regular polish.  In the past I  tried base coats and polish that got rated well by EWG and found them to be very offensive smelling.  Not Piggy Paint.  It is the least offensive option out there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the finish goes - both my daughter and I were initially thrilled with the Piggy Paint products.  However, after a day or two, we realized that the finish does not last very long.  It chips especially on the sides of the nails which indicates to me that it can&#x27;t handle the flexing of the nails and starts to crack.  This is the only reason I changed my initial rating of 5 stars down to 3.  It is pricy considering how frequently you would have to reapply if you like your nails \\&quot;done\\&quot; all of the time.  However we still love it because of the lack of odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.  It takes forever to get the polish off your nails, even if you use the recommended Piggy Paint Remover.</li>
    <li> I thought I would leave my review with some tips on this Piggy Paint item since you&#x27;re probably seeking to make things last longer than a couple days with this one. I have found that using this set, I can get my manicure to last a week and pedicure to last two to three weeks without chipping. It generally looks and lasts better than my other premium polishes. In fact, it is almost a pain to take off compared to the others!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Buff smooth and use the base coat. I&#x27;ve found it is hard to get off so sometimes I just use regular base coat/nail conditioner for convenience. Any bumps will show as the polish dries unlike enamel which can really glop on and almost self-smooth.&lt;br /&gt;2. To get a smooth finish, use less paint. This polish doesn&#x27;t self-level like enamels so do not not use too much. Once you get used to painting with less polish, it goes on smoothly just like the regular stuff. Think more coats, thinner coats.&lt;br /&gt;3. Love, love the topcoat. It is super strong, use two coats. Very shiny, rivals my others but lasts longer.&lt;br /&gt;4. Keep the nails short - like regular polish longer nails leads to more pressure and chips.&lt;br /&gt;5. Make sure the paint is shaken thoroughly before use. The pigment doesn&#x27;t suspend the same as with enamels so make sure it is mixed well. On the plus side, it also doesn&#x27;t suspend air bubbles like enamels do.&lt;br /&gt;6. Use a hair dryer, like they say, or do it before bed so it has time to cure. I have done this but also been too busy to do it and it still lasts nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found the Piggy Paints with some sparkle go on more smoothly, e.g. All that Razz and Sometimes Sweet. I&#x27;m really impressed with the quality of these paints. I wash my hands at least two dozen times a day with a toddler. This stuff really lasts, and like I said - it is tough to get off!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I wanted to add this about chips - I do sometimes get chips after a couple days on my pointer fingers. Piggy Paint fills chips better than regular sinceit isn&#x27;t gloppy like enamel. Just spot fix on the chip, let dry and do a clear topcoat. Looks like new every time unlike when I try to fix chips with enamel.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t a believer when I added it to my cart. I don&#x27;t like spending so much on nail polish, but safety is important to me. I was painting my toddler&#x27;s nails with piggy paint, but it would come off so quickly. One bath and her nail polish was half off already. Then I found myself using her piggy paint for my own nails since I was expecting and didn&#x27;t want to use my own nail polish. How frustrating to have it all chipped a mere several hours later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I bought these and used them on my toenails. I applied the basecoat, then the piggy paint color of my choice, then the topcoat to my toenails a few weeks ago. I shower frequently and didn&#x27;t expect a positive experience. Let me just say that all of the paint remained intact up until last night, at least three weeks after first applying, when I actually struggled to take it off my toes!!! I attempted to use the piggy paint nail polish remover, but it was taking foreverrr and hardly making a dent, so I switched over to real nail polish remover hoping to speed up the process and be done with it. No such luck. I really had to scrub at my nails to get the paint to come off. I can only attribute that to this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line &#x3D; this actually seems to prevent chipping&lt;br /&gt;Pro &#x3D; see above&lt;br /&gt;Con &#x3D; tough to take off nail polish</li>
    <li> I love piggy paint polish does what it says, however the brush sucks, very cheap plastic material for the price you pay that&#x27;s my only complaint.</li>
    <li> These two definitely made a difference on how long the polish stayed on my daughters nails. It helped keep her nails from chipping after a day.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about the longevity of the base and top coat, but my manicure held up for nearly a week. I am very harsh on my hands and this week was a busy one. I used an Essie color in between the coats and it stayed shiny the whole time. I chose this product because of its very low score on EWG&#x27;s SkinDeep list and I&#x27;m glad I did, I will sing Piggy Paints praises from the rooftops.</li>
    <li> I, like many others, was trying to find a way to make the polish last longer, because, for me, it only lasts a few days on your nails before chipping....I bought the Piggy Paint because of it&#x27;s claim of being non-toxic... I thought this was the answer....read the ingredients before buying....I&#x27;m not an expert but I would not have wasted my money on this product if I had checked it out more....it has a odor just like regular polish, which tells me it&#x27;s probably NOT non-toxic...the regular Piggy Paint does not.....I threw it away....</li>
    <li> YOU MUST PURCHASE THIS IF YOU WANT YOUR NAIL POLISH TO LAST AND BE DURABLE.&lt;br /&gt; Use the 4 step application process for best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Basecoat (apply thin layer and let air dry)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Color (apply 2-3 thin coats of Piggy Paint nail polish. Between polish coats, blow dry polished nails on warm heat, low blower setting. With no harsh chemicals, the heat hardens the polish for maximum chip resistance)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ENJOY!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Shine Topcoat (apply for shine + scratch resistance)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Seal (apply Basecoat + Sealer on top of Topcoat for extended wear. Be sure to cover tips of nails. Repeat blow dryer)</li>
    <li> Perfect accompaniment for the Piggy Paint Polish.  It certainly extends the life of the polish.</li>
    <li> Dries fast and makes the polish last as long as the ones with harsh chemicals. You can skip the hair dryer part that they recommend. It works fine if you just buff your nails first. Even though it&#x27;s four coats, each one dries in a fraction of the time that a normal nail polish takes.</li>
    <li> I feel that if I use this with the piggy paint polish it comes off faster.</li>
    <li> Really enjoyed how this base and top coat worked on keeping nail polish on for longer. It dries pretty quickly as well</li>
    <li> It has very low odor, and does extend the life of my piggy painted nail polish. Unfortunately, the nail polish takes about thirty minutes to apply with the basecoat and topcoat and really only lasts a few days. I like it. I&#x27;ll keep purchasing it, but as much as I like the look and confidence boost, it isn&#x27;t feasible to wear daily. I never was a manicure/pedicure person, so I don&#x27;t have much comparison, but it seems like a big effort for such a short span. I usually wear it for about a week before removing, but I probably wouldn&#x27;t get away with that in a professional office.</li>
    <li> Terrible smell, and it does not seem to make my polish last any better (or worse) than &#x27;traditional&#x27; nail polish brands.  It is nice that this is better for me, which is the only reason I purchased it.</li>
    <li> Expensive, but totally worth it.</li>
    <li> I am so disappointed in these products! I put basecoat, piggy polish, then the top coat. It took me two hours to scrub off!</li>
    <li> If you follow instructions it does last significantly longer than just piggy paint color by itself.  The base coat is a bit stinky compared to the odorless piggy paints we are used to.  All in all another good product by piggy paint even if it doesn&#x27;t seem as non toxic as the rest.</li>
    <li> I love that it is non toxic, but it did come out way faster than expected. I think it&#x27;s more suitable for kids.</li>
    <li> This really makes the piggy paint last. It makes the difference between the polish lasting hours or days.</li>
    <li> I like it for the ingredients but it doesn&#x27;t last very long.  But the girls love to put it on and I don&#x27;t worry about what&#x27;s touching their skin.</li>
    <li> If you follow the instructions and dry as directed, this product lasts! My no color manicure hasn&#x27;t even chipped in 9 days, and my colored pedicure still looks great too. I&#x27;m reserving the 5th star for later when I can tell if the rash on my eyelid from an allergy to enamel goes away. It is already much better, so this will probably be a 5 star product for me. Also, my nail beds under the clear polish are nice and pink, and the clear polish hasn&#x27;t turned yellow. I am loving it so far. If you have allergies to regular polish, check back for my report on the eyelid issue.</li>
    <li> couldn&#x27;t tell which was bas and which was topcoat!</li>
    <li> Really disappointed .  My nails chipped and the next day.  I won&#x27;t be getting any more of this.</li>
    <li> nail polish has lasted 2 weeks currently with no chips!</li>
    <li> The base and top coat do seem to make the polish last longer.</li>
    <li> I like the base coat. It is very sticky. I actually had parts of my nail polish that wouldn&#x27;t come off with nail polish remover with the first go. The top coat is a little weird. It is hard to get to dry. Both are a really thin formula ... like watery... weird.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t make Piggy Paint last longer!</li>
    <li> Helps make it last a little longer on kiddos who do everything with their hands! Makes kids feel super special with the extra touch!</li>
    <li> I must say I didn&#x27;t really want to spend extra money on base and top coats, the polish is already expensive enough, but that&#x27;s the price you pay to avoid chemicals while sporting a pedicure. I only paint my daughters toes (she&#x27;s 3), but I noticed with this her paint stays on much longer and she went about an entire week without chips. With just polish alone she used to only go one or two days without chipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to rate any piggy paint polish high because it&#x27;s the safest option (in my opinion and experience) and I feel this is the only polish I would use on my daughter who loves painted toes.</li>
    <li> Awful consistancy, chippy, smelled weird, it was like putting oil and water on  my nails</li>
    <li> This is what you need to make Piggy Paint or Honeybee Gardens nail polish last. My polish lasts for most of the week now. I work with as a cashier, so moderate hand use, and it lasts as well as I&#x27;d would hope a polish to last. Without the base and top coats, neither polish lasts much more than a day.</li>
    <li> Glad I found the two pack...I didn&#x27;t use enough of the topcoat on my fingernails so it did chip within two days..next time I will follow rec. amt and do about 3 sweeps over it..I love that it doesn&#x27;t have chemicals</li>
    <li> Dries fast. Helps color last long. Extra shine top coat.</li>
    <li> I had been using piggy paint on my daughter for about a month and was annoyed how quickly it would chip. This primer and top coat make all the difference! Sure, it takes an extra few minutes, but now her polish will last up to a week (she is 8 months old). I blow dry her nails in between each layer. Works like a charm.</li>
    <li> colors both basically went on clear</li>
    <li> GREAT product.  As described, works well for us!</li>
