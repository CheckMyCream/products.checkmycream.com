      <li>Fast delivery.great product</li>
      <li>I love the blue color - it was back ordered and worth the wait.  </li>

      <li>and she really likes it.</li>
      <li>it is fast an</li>
      <li>cuz I took to much hair.</li>

      <li>If you have thick, long hair, the curls just aren&#x27;t as great as the pictures claim.</li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>Hair keeps getting stuck in it just buy an old fashioned curling iron</li>
      <li>However just to warn you, it does take a LONG time the first time that you curl your hair.</li>
      <li>Bought this for my 13 yr old Grandaughter  fir Christmas  </li>
      <li>My hair is naturally wavy and holds curl</li>
      <li>In short, if you have stubborn straight hair definitely give this curling iron a try.</li>
      <li>I just received it today and was able to do my hair, which is long and extra thick in about 20 minutes.  </li>
      <li>Not sure it&#x27;s worth the price...  </li>

    <li> I watched my cousin do her friend&#x27;s hair with this product.  The 8 second curl was ok.  However, later she did her hair on the medium setting and it looked fantastic! Great defined curls that held all day!  She also did her daughter&#x27;s hair on the tightest curl setting and it looked amazing.  Not a single curl was flat or out of shape, they were all perfectly formed, and stayed that way!</li>
    <li> Hair keeps getting stuck in it just buy an old fashioned curling iron</li>
    <li> As described and shipped quickly. Wife love it watch YouTube video first and you will have no issues. Heavier than curling iron.</li>
    <li> Was a gift and she loves it.</li>
    <li> Amazing!!!! Works like Magic!!</li>
    <li> I really like it. It works great when having to do your own hair.</li>
    <li> I love the blue color - it was back ordered and worth the wait.  I don&#x27;t get the negative reviews.  I just received it today and was able to do my hair, which is long and extra thick in about 20 minutes.  Yes, you have to section your hair and use 1/4 to 1/2 inch sections but I already do that when I flat iron it.  I only had it tangle twice but it was not a problem; I just opened the machine and gently tugged for it to release my hair.  I am super pleased with the results.  My hair is naturally wavy and holds curl well so someone with super straight hair might have a different result.</li>
    <li> Can be tricky to use but makes a nice curl.</li>
    <li> Wow! This curling iron is amazing. I have super straight hair and it NEVER holds curls. I used this curling iron one time as a trial run without using any products and the curls stayed in my hair for more than 8 hours. I was extremely impressed. Normally I have to spray my hair down until it is almost stiff for curls to stay and even then they only last a few hours (and ONLY if a professional curled them). I am not sure what their secret is but it is well worth the money! However just to warn you, it does take a LONG time the first time that you curl your hair. It takes a while to get used too since you have to hold the curling iron at a certain angle. Once you get the hang of it you will start to curl your hair faster and faster. I also loved the fact it came with an instructional booklet which really helped me since I was new to curling my own hair. In short, if you have stubborn straight hair definitely give this curling iron a try.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I cannot use this gadget I have to buy a power converter for Australian standard.  I knew this product through my sister she recommended this product to me.  It can be dangerous if one is not careful and read the instructions carefully.</li>
    <li> Great product, as described, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Not sure it&#x27;s worth the price...  it works as advertised</li>
    <li> If you have thick, long hair, the curls just aren&#x27;t as great as the pictures claim. It works  though.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 13 yr old Grandaughter  fir Christmas  and she really likes it.</li>
    <li> Alright  tangled hair will get caught in it</li>
    <li> works well, off you have extra thick hair, get up a little earlier.</li>
    <li> This is the best curling iron I have bought in a long time. My hair does not take the curl very well but when I use this tool my curls have lasted a lot longer.  I don&#x27;t worry about it burning my head either. It also has different time settings, I keep it on the highest time to get the best curl.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery.great product</li>
    <li> Maybe i dont know how to use it correctly just yet but none of my curls stay. Most of them fall out an flip different ways i dont like. 😕 it is fast an thats good but ill take any tips of any. If i cant get them to stay then looks like ill go back to my regular curling iron an return this one.</li>
    <li> Love this!  Only curling iron/device that will curl my hair and last all day!</li>
    <li> Makes amazing curls! My hair did get caught up in the barrel but that&#x27;s cuz I took to much hair. But other than that I would definitely recommend it</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical when i bought this but i will say i am shicked at how easy it is to use and how well it works!  I would definitely recommend this to everyone!</li>
    <li> just got this and tryed it out...works great...love the curls...need to see if it does great curls after i use my flat iron to straighten my hair, so i can get rid of the frizzy...ect...my hair didnt get stuck once...and works quickly...cant wait to use it on my entire hair....thou bit pricey , but if this last me for years to come...well worth the money....oh and my hair is middle of my back...for those wondering if it works good on long hair like mine</li>
    <li> Best invention EVER!!!</li>
