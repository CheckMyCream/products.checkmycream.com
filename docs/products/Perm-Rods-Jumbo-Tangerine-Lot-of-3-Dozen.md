      <li>Easy to use.  </li>

      <li>One of the rollers elastic straps detatched but was easy to repair.</li>

      <li>It takes a bit of time to master how to get the perm rod to stay tightly on your hair, but once I figured it out, it was great.</li>

      <li>I only went by the photo which shows twelve rollers and wound up ordering more than I needed.  </li>
      <li>This is first time using this type of curler.</li>
      <li>exactly as advertised.</li>
      <li>They came pretty fast.  </li>
      <li>the shipping is really fast.</li>
      <li>I will enjoy using them for different styles.</li>
      <li>Will update review when I can find out about quality; I haven&#x27;t used them often enough to give an adequate assessment of that yet.</li>
      <li>They work the way they are supposed to although I probably should have gotten a smaller size because I can only use them in the top of my hair.</li>
      <li>none of mine have snapped yet and I&#x27;ve owned this item for about 5 months now, with quite frequent usage.</li>

<li> They&#x27;re sturdy and the rubber band is pretty thick-</li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t had any trouble so far</li>
<li> The stretch band is really just a thick elastic band.</li>
<li> but if you&#x27;re rough with it, I can see it snapping on you.</li>
<li> I agree with the previous reviews.</li>
<li> and I couldn&#x27;t get them as tight as I wanted.  </li>
<li> The band is not strong and will not be very tight.</li>
<li> I two strand twisted and then rolled the twists.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I only received one pack of the tangerine rod&#x27;s as well</li>
    <li> They are about 3/4 &amp;#34; they were easy to use.</li>
    <li> Does what it is suppose to do.</li>
    <li> These worked perfect. The size was perfect for my length hair and they were super easy to put in. Not the most compfy to sleep in ...but beauty knows no pain right??? I would recommend these for sure....also you can&#x27;t beat that price!!!</li>
    <li> NOW I JUST NEED TO LEARN TO USE THEM PROPERLY SO THEY DON&#x27;T KEEP FALLING OUT OF MY HAIR &#x27;...</li>
    <li> Thank you....awesome price!</li>
    <li> exactly as advertised. good deal</li>
    <li> Standard perm rods.  Great price.  I received 3 dozen, just as ordered.</li>
    <li> I agree with the previous reviews. The band is not strong and will not be very tight. I was able to get some pretty relaxed waves.</li>
    <li> I purchased these to use for a twist out.  My hair is still king of short.  They are made well.  This is first time using this type of curler.</li>
    <li> Just the right size for a body wave.  But, you will only need (one pkg.) ... which is (36) rollers for one head.  I only went by the photo which shows twelve rollers and wound up ordering more than I needed.  I was able to return the extra, un-opened packages.  One order is all you&#x27;ll need.</li>
    <li> I wish the teeth had more gripping power.  My hair slides off instead of catching in the teeth. People with hair longer than 5&amp;#34; shouldn&#x27;t have any problems.</li>
    <li> Good sized curls.  Rods in great condition, meaning they didn&#x27;t break.</li>
    <li> Very good, sturdy rollers. Bargain, too.</li>
    <li> Good quality and price.</li>
    <li> I received these rollers on time, excellent condition. They were helpful I obtaining the most perfect curls. I would buy them again.</li>
    <li> I loved them.  They came pretty fast.  Three bags of six, and great size.  I will enjoy using them for different styles.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re perm rods, not much to review here, lol. They work the way they are supposed to although I probably should have gotten a smaller size because I can only use them in the top of my hair.</li>
    <li> Well these do what they&#x27;re supposed to. It takes a bit of time to master how to get the perm rod to stay tightly on your hair, but once I figured it out, it was great. They&#x27;re sturdy and the rubber band is pretty thick- none of mine have snapped yet and I&#x27;ve owned this item for about 5 months now, with quite frequent usage. I&#x27;ve used them on both weave and my own relaxed hair, and it looks great.</li>
    <li> The product arrive in time. One of the rollers elastic straps detatched but was easy to repair. These rollers worked great! A beautiful heatless curl. I have a 4c curl ...I two strand twisted and then rolled the twists. Perfect!!</li>
    <li> Easy to use.  I wish I had gone with smaller ones now though.</li>
    <li> i would&#x27;ve give this product 5 stars but the reason is, after the third use some of the top pop off which is fixable. the shipping is really fast.</li>
    <li> Perfect size rod if you want bigger curls or wavy not to curly hair.</li>
    <li> These are great for use on synthetic hair as the little &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; catch and hold them well. However, I wouldn&#x27;t use these on my hair. They would not stay on. I use them to make curls in the hair when I make wigs, and they work fine for that. The stretch band is really just a thick elastic band. I haven&#x27;t had any trouble so far but if you&#x27;re rough with it, I can see it snapping on you. This pack of 3 dozen does save me time when making pre-made curls for my wigs.</li>
    <li> Rods were great.  Gave a more body and a lose curl. Just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t care for these.  The rubber band part pulls out of the side and I couldn&#x27;t get them as tight as I wanted.  Probably just me.</li>
    <li> Item came on time, was a great price, and was as described. Will update review when I can find out about quality; I haven&#x27;t used them often enough to give an adequate assessment of that yet.</li>
    <li> It came just in time and the perm rods work wonders with some holding cream for my 3b to 3c hair texture. I love them!</li>
