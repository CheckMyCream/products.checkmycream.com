      <li>my family and I are no strangers to traveling and enjoying the outdoors.</li>
      <li>Bought as a gift, recipient said it was just okay, so I gave it just an &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>This is an excellent product that actually does what it says it does.</li>
      <li>and then I noticed that I had fine bumps on the lower part of both cheeks.</li>
      <li>,i recommend this for anyone who has black spots or pigmentation issues with their skin(especially people of color),the size is also perfect you can carry it indescreetly in your pocket and apply whenever</li>

      <li>Ambi works great, dark spots are fading within days.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very effective in providing an even skin tone after a few weeks</li>
      <li>This is a good brand of fade cream for dark spots.</li>
      <li>but I would not use this on my face as Hydroquinone is sensitive to light and can cause problems if you&#x27;re in the sun.  </li>
      <li>it really works!</li>
      <li>However, it burns when first applied, and I have not seen any improvement in skin tone.  </li>
      <li>This stuff really really works!</li>
      <li>I had a large brown spot on my face, about the size of a nickel.  </li>
      <li>As described ultra fast shipping.</li>
      <li>I had a sprinkling of age spots on my arms and one that really bothered me on my face; using Ambi Fade Cream twice a day as specified,  they are gone or very close to gone in a couple of weeks.  </li>
      <li>it shipped so fast as well),already</li>
      <li>and I saw a very noticable difference after about 6 days.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t really observed any changes like I was expecting from many of the other reviews.</li>
      <li>After taking a vacation to the Grand Canyon, I noticed some dark spots on my face even though I had liberally applied sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>spots- worked better than all the other pricey stuff I tried!</li>
      <li>highly recommended</li>
      <li>In as little as a week of using this twice a day, everyone has been able to see the difference.</li>
      <li>If you have discoloration issues, I strongly recommend using ambi on all dark spots.</li>
      <li>It does take some time to see results but it definitely does work if you stay consistent and have realistic expectations.</li>
      <li>I cannot say enough about this magic little tube.</li>
      <li>My skin is completely even toned and soft.</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t seen much improvement in the dark spots on my elbow since using this.</li>
      <li>Apparently it needs to be applied for several months to show any effect..</li>

<li> You just need to be consistent and follow the application procedures and apply it on at least two times a day.</li>
<li> I tried several products in an attempt to make them disappear but was only more frustrated.  </li>
<li> and it&#x27;s slowly going back to normal.</li>
<li> I tried several other products to lighten it, and nothing worked well.  </li>

<li> The Ambi Fade Cream has 2% Hydroquinone as listed as the active ingredient.  </li>
<li> or if I ever have dark spots again.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t feel like this faded dark marks as advertised; the dark spots are still there after months of usage...</li>
<li> expected.will correct that as soon as dark moves are fully gone.</li>
<li> I have really dark elbows but after applying twince a day (before bed and in the morning)</li>
<li> I did not see results, my dark spots remain.  </li>
<li> less than a month now, seen some lightening of the dark spots.</li>
<li> i can see see a slight difference</li>
<li> My mom recommended I try this product I have been using it twice a day for the past month for dark spots caused by acne and, all of my dark spots are gone!  </li>
<li> I only used it for approximately one week</li>
<li> of course my face looks pitchy patchy (uneven toned) but</li>
<li> I was in a terrible car accident about 7 years ago and have a very large scar on the left side of my face.</li>
<li> Waste of time and money!</li>
<li> When the spot threatens to return, I use this for a few days and it&#x27;s gone again!  </li>
<li> it made it worse waste of money .</li>
<li> my skin color is medium beige and i suffered from discoloration around my mouth and horrible dark circles</li>
<li> I am very unhappy with this product.</li>
<li> I hated those spots and felt like my face was ruined by that vacation.  </li>

    <li> I love ambi products  and this cream is amazing. My skin is completely even toned and soft. If you have discoloration issues, I strongly recommend using ambi on all dark spots. Just be patient and you will start to see results.</li>
    <li> This stuff really really works! I have really dark elbows but after applying twince a day (before bed and in the morning) I see a huge difference!</li>
    <li> After taking a vacation to the Grand Canyon, I noticed some dark spots on my face even though I had liberally applied sunscreen.  I hated those spots and felt like my face was ruined by that vacation.  I tried several products in an attempt to make them disappear but was only more frustrated.  This is the only product that has worked.  I only apply it to the areas where I have spots.  It took a couple of weeks for the lighter spots to fade and longer for the darker ones.  You can&#x27;t beat the price.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift, recipient said it was just okay, so I gave it just an &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> My mom recommended I try this product I have been using it twice a day for the past month for dark spots caused by acne and, all of my dark spots are gone!  I am so thankful for this product. This will definitely be my go to product when or if I ever have dark spots again.</li>
    <li> As per instructions, I used Ambi for three months, applying once or twice daily.  I did not see results, my dark spots remain.  I am very unhappy with this product.</li>
    <li> The Ambi Fade Cream has 2% Hydroquinone as listed as the active ingredient.  It&#x27;s very effective in providing an even skin tone after a few weeks but I would not use this on my face as Hydroquinone is sensitive to light and can cause problems if you&#x27;re in the sun.  I use this on parts that won&#x27;t be exposed to sunlight and it works great!  Just like anything else, this should be used in moderation as there is some controversy as to the safety of Hydroquinone.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen much improvement in the dark spots on my elbow since using this.</li>
    <li> has not faded any of my sun spots and i have been using it for 2 months</li>
    <li> less than a month now, seen some lightening of the dark spots. of course my face looks pitchy patchy (uneven toned) but expected.will correct that as soon as dark moves are fully gone.</li>
    <li> Great item, priced well as Amazon always is. As described ultra fast shipping.</li>
    <li> it really works! my skin color is medium beige and i suffered from discoloration around my mouth and horrible dark circles I&#x27;ve been using this for alor 2 weeks and I&#x27;m so happy !!!</li>
    <li> I had a sprinkling of age spots on my arms and one that really bothered me on my face; using Ambi Fade Cream twice a day as specified,  they are gone or very close to gone in a couple of weeks.  It is also fading a bit of over-tan on one arm that is surrounding an age spot.  I would heartily recommend this for anyone starting to get age spots and maybe for those with LOTS of liver spots also.</li>
    <li> Ambi&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an adventurous mommy of 2, my family and I are no strangers to traveling and enjoying the outdoors. During our previous visit to the Philippines, I suffered from mosquito bites on my legs that left bruises. I have used Ambi in the past and it has worked to clear up skin darkening. So, decided to used this on my mosquito marks. While it did take about 4 weeks, there was a remarkable difference. I was thrilled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With summer upon us, I purchased another tube to have on hand. It arrived quickly and presented in a slim profile, making it a great product to throw in your beach bag. Packaging was protected and I had no issues with shipping. The product itself has a bit of a smell (not too off putting, but noticeable), but quickly dissipated after application. Over all, a great product to carry in your &amp;#34;must haves&amp;#34; aresenal.</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough about this magic little tube. I was in a terrible car accident about 7 years ago and have a very large scar on the left side of my face. In as little as a week of using this twice a day, everyone has been able to see the difference. It is perfect to correct acne spots, age spots, and just over all brighten your complexion.</li>
    <li> I only used it for approximately one week and then I noticed that I had fine bumps on the lower part of both cheeks. I&#x27;ve stopped using it since then.</li>
    <li> This is a good brand of fade cream for dark spots. I used it to even out my skin tone and it&#x27;s slowly going back to normal. You just need to be consistent and follow the application procedures and apply it on at least two times a day. It does take some time to see results but it definitely does work if you stay consistent and have realistic expectations.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t really observed any changes like I was expecting from many of the other reviews. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t bother - didn&#x27;t faze a brown spot that I have on my hand.  Worhless!  Waste of time and money!</li>
    <li> same as the product that come in the dual pack just different wording in presentation and therefore more expensive to purchase as a single</li>
    <li> I have used morning and night for four weeks and I can not see any difference.</li>
    <li> this cream is incredible received it 2 days ago(surprised it shipped so fast as well),already i can see see a slight difference my my skin complexion,i recommend this for anyone who has black spots or pigmentation issues with their skin(especially people of color),the size is also perfect you can carry it indescreetly in your pocket and apply whenever</li>
    <li> This lotion is great! I used it on my stomach where I had discoloration from stretch marks and I saw a very noticable difference after about 6 days. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I had a large brown spot on my face, about the size of a nickel.  My dermatologist froze it off - twice - and it came back darker each time.  I tried several other products to lighten it, and nothing worked well.  This did.  After just a week, the spot began to fade, and it was *gone* after a month of using this twice a day.  When the spot threatens to return, I use this for a few days and it&#x27;s gone again!  This is an excellent product that actually does what it says it does.</li>
    <li> Negligible effect, after 3 months of regular use.</li>
    <li> Ambi works great, dark spots are fading within days. I will buy again and I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Great product!!! highly recommended</li>
    <li> I ordered it for a bruise on my leg that didnt fade for months. I used it for around 2 months but it didn&#x27;t help with pigmentation. The pack said that it should not be used more than 3 months , so I discontinued</li>
    <li> Cream has neutral fragrance and absorbs nicely.  However, it burns when first applied, and I have not seen any improvement in skin tone.  Apparently it needs to be applied for several months to show any effect..</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t feel like this faded dark marks as advertised; the dark spots are still there after months of usage...</li>
    <li> graet lightweight product and seems to work very well:)</li>
    <li> I do not recommend this product I used it and didnt help at all it made it worse waste of money .</li>
    <li> I only have used for a month, so I sse no change as of now.</li>
    <li> Very effective. Just be patient for results.</li>
    <li> Amazing!!! Cleared up my brown spots- worked better than all the other pricey stuff I tried! Everyone now comments on my skin- best product ever!</li>
