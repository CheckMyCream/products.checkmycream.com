      <li>Would like to order more...</li>

      <li>I wanted to get powder puffs to apply my powder on top of my foundation.</li>
      <li>I also loop the satin holder around the cap of the appropriate powder scent</li>
      <li>Their ok.  </li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>I am using them but will still be looking for a poof that fits the glass powder dish better.</li>
      <li>Much better way of powdering oneself</li>
      <li>Love them.</li>
      <li>3 months or more have passed on my first batch and they still look great and are holding together securely.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted, size was perfect, at a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>they are great and for the price I would highly recommend them</li>
      <li>The puffs are good quality and warrant a higher star rating than 2; however, the ones I received were NOT 3-4 inches in diameter as described.</li>
      <li>Yes, they&#x27;re soft, yes they&#x27;re durable and yes, it was a great value.</li>
      <li>These are great and soft.</li>
      <li>Although the puffs are not exactly 4 inches, they are the perfect size needed for body powder.</li>
      <li>They easily take up the talc powder and keep it from flying everywhere.  </li>
      <li>Good product, received pretty quickly.  </li>
      <li>but they are large and they feel like synthetic material but for the price that is ok!</li>
      <li>she said they would be fine..  </li>
      <li>The product came quickly!</li>
      <li>If I don&#x27;t find better ones I most certainly will order these again.</li>
      <li>Accurately described and pictured.</li>
      <li>I put four stars because they are great puffs, but they are just to big for what I like to use.</li>
      <li>However, I am very pleased with their performance thus far and would repurchase.</li>
      <li>The actual quality of the puff looked good.</li>
      <li>But thanks anyway, I will order more.</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly with no problems.  </li>
      <li>Thank you very much!</li>
      <li>Very soft and met more than my expectations.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
      <li>I went to get one of the old ones to make sure I wasn&#x27;t seeing things.</li>
      <li>just right.  </li>
      <li>Just right for what I needed.</li>
      <li>Just the right sizes for the container.</li>
      <li>These are nice BUT not the 4 inch as promised-by reviews~very soft &amp; gentle &amp; yes they are very nice!&lt;br /&gt;Thus</li>
      <li>Great size (larger than I anticipated) so can be used for a variety of applications, and I appreciate that it comes as a set of 3 because it allows me to designate puffs for specific purposes.</li>
      <li>Very fast shipping.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love these. They are large and fluffy, just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Good buy as it is hard to find powder puffs by themselves.</li>
    <li> 3.5 These are small puffs and will no doubt last a while.  The downside is that they do not hold the powder and it just lies on the top.  I could insert two of my fingers comfortably through the ribbon, no need to insert 3 for such a small puff.</li>
    <li> The puffs are very soft and fluffy, more so than they looked from the online site.  I look forward to using them.</li>
    <li> I could not find these in any store and was pleased to find them here.  They are a good quality.  Just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Perfect size, fluffiness and durability for my body dusting powder needs. My second order of this product. They are soft and hold powder well, have a hand/finger strap/grip and are a reasonable price.  At 3 1/2 to 3 3/4 inches wide (diameter) they fit my cardboard dusting powder boxes snugly and work well for my larger plastic and glass vintage holders also.  Though one can order larger sizes for the larger boxes I find it best to have something a little smaller than the powder container itself. I have ordered larger puffs elsewhere for my containers that are above 5 inches, but the price for one puff has been nearly as much as for this bag of three. I haven&#x27;t tried it so far, but I bet they will also hand wash in the sink with gentle soap without falling apart and dry well. (Reusable) Yet, they are inexpensive enough to toss after a few months if one wants to keep recommended hygiene standards.  3 months or more have passed on my first batch and they still look great and are holding together securely. (I had another brand&#x27;s ribbon strap break almost immediately.) No molding or mildew or stickiness problems in my humid climate. Perfect fluffiness, other brands had shorter or far too long of a nap.</li>
    <li> Smaller than described.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t believe I found this (from my days).  However, I ordered it too large. But thanks anyway, I will order more.</li>
    <li> Nice feel to these puffs... I love them</li>
    <li> I have ordered these powder puffs before and am very pleased with them. I replace my body powder puffs with them and use them when the powder box does not include the puffs. I will certainly order them again.</li>
    <li> The puffs are good quality and warrant a higher star rating than 2; however, the ones I received were NOT 3-4 inches in diameter as described. They were at least half the size I had expected. I was disappointed because I have been looking for a body powder puff for a while.  I returned them.</li>
    <li> They work great for me</li>
    <li> Standard size.  Fits my wife&#x27;s container just right.  Seems to be well made.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product and the delivery.  I needed a very specific power puff and I found them on the Miles Kimball site. The package came within a few days of ordering and the fluffy puffs fit my container perfectly!  Yeah!</li>
    <li> Very good quality. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> These powder puffs are impossible to find at your local store. They usually come with the powder it&#x27;s self. But the powder puffs get Old after a period of time. Amazon is the only place where I&#x27;ve been able to find just the powder puffs. Thanks!</li>
    <li> great quality.  shipper sent it early.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted, size was perfect, at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Great price, soft fluffy. Fast delivery. But I wanted larger, my mistake . But these are good quality.</li>
    <li> Good product, received pretty quickly.  Happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> So fluffy!  Love them.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for. Although the puffs are not exactly 4 inches, they are the perfect size needed for body powder. Love the quality, the ease in which to wash them, and the price. You can&#x27;t beat it. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I read many reviews before purchasing items, and the reviews for these were spot on.  They are large and very, very soft.  They easily take up the talc powder and keep it from flying everywhere.  They seem of good construction, too.</li>
    <li> i bought these for face and it&#x27;s just bit too large for applying powder to the face. Would work so well for body powders however.</li>
    <li> These are nice BUT not the 4 inch as promised-by reviews~very soft &amp; gentle &amp; yes they are very nice!&lt;br /&gt;Thus the 4 stars for size.</li>
    <li> Got these for a neighbor who won&#x27;t use the internet,  yeah.. I dunno either.. she said they would be fine..  and that&#x27;s about all I know about them.</li>
    <li> These puffs are high-quality, very fluffy and the right size for body powder ~ worth the price!</li>
    <li> These powder puffs are very good, though I am still looking for better quality puffs that are fluffier. For the price I paid they are okay. If I don&#x27;t find better ones I most certainly will order these again.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed! It said for the measurements 4 inchs, the three of them were only 2 inchs!!!  Not Happy 😰</li>
    <li> I wanted to get powder puffs to apply my powder on top of my foundation. These are super soft but they are absolutely massive. They don&#x27;t fit into any of my compacts and it&#x27;s hard to get any of my Laura Mercier Translucent Powder onto these because they don&#x27;t fit into the packaging. On top of that, the fabric is a weird (but soft) texture that doesn&#x27;t leave a great finish on the powder I apply to my face. The moral is... I don&#x27;t recommend these.</li>
    <li> These Powder Puffs are exactly what i was looking for. 4-1/2&amp;#34; W/ a satin strap to hold for Easier Application of my gold bond cornstarch powder. I am not using, TALCUM Powder, it is Cancer causing! this size powder puff is difficult to find in stores. LOVE THEM!!! Great Buy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not entirely sure how to rate powder puffs.  Yes, they&#x27;re soft, yes they&#x27;re durable and yes, it was a great value.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> made well work great my daughter loves them</li>
    <li> great deal ! very soft .</li>
    <li> A little smaller than I thought they would be.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Got them for DIY lavender/cornstarch powder.</li>
    <li> They are smaller than I wanted. They cant be 4 inches in diameter. I am using them but will still be looking for a poof that fits the glass powder dish better.</li>
    <li> Very nice...good quality.. :)  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> These powder puffs have changed. I have bought and used these for body powders that I make and sell. Normally these puffs have been large and fluffy. In fact, the ones I bought just a couple months ago were large and fluffy. My order came today, and I opened up the box to find 12 puffs that were very different from what I usually receive. I went to get one of the old ones to make sure I wasn&#x27;t seeing things. It was clear how small and cheap the new ones were. They were also made out of something like velour. I didn&#x27;t even take the packages out of the box before I was arranging to return them within 2 minutes. I would like the old powder puffs back as these are just plain lame, especially at $10 a pack. Anna Marie Tang</li>
    <li> Generous size.  Just right for what I needed.</li>
    <li> Nice size, good quality.</li>
    <li> I was expecting a thicker pad</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. I had to return them because they were much smaller than advertised.</li>
    <li> Very nice puffs. Soft and just the right size.</li>
    <li> These puffs were not a size for BODY use;  size was only appropriate for face.  The actual quality of the puff looked good.</li>
    <li> Weren&#x27;t as big as I thought they would be</li>
    <li> Their ok.  Was hoping they were fluffier.</li>
    <li> I put four stars because they are great puffs, but they are just to big for what I like to use.</li>
    <li> The product came quickly! And there very nice! I&#x27;m very happy with them! I&#x27;m sorry I didn&#x27;t leave my review sooner! Thank you very much!</li>
    <li> These are very nice powder puffs.  I sprinkle Yardley English Lavender or English Rose right on the puff and none gets into the air, just on me.  I also loop the satin holder around the cap of the appropriate powder scent so I don&#x27;t mix them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These will hold up for a really long time.  I ordered extra so even when I need to toss one, I&#x27;ll have way too many, but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll use them or gift them with powder some day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave them 4 stars because it is very hard to &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; a powder puff, but I really like these.</li>
    <li> Soft and perfect size for a powder container with a 4&#x27; diameter.  Would like to order more...Amazon needs to place this back into it&#x27;s order choices.</li>
    <li> these are perfect for what I wanted to use them for I use a natural deodorant and it leaves me kind of sticky so I use a talcum powder on top of my deodorant.  they are great and for the price I would highly recommend them</li>
    <li> hard to find!  Good size...very soft...just what I was looking for.  FAST shipping</li>
    <li> Excellent value for grata quality product! Very pleased with the thickness, softness and size. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with quality of powder puffs. Speedy delivery &amp; will be a happy repeat customer.</li>
    <li> very nice puffs.  Will buy more</li>
    <li> product is nice - good condition - arrived promptyl - good experience - thanks</li>
    <li> Just the right sizes for the container.</li>
    <li> Just what my Mom has been looking for!</li>
    <li> love them, great buy!</li>
    <li> I got these to apply my finishing-powder after foundation. They are a little big for it, but work just fine. These are probably better for body powder, but the quality is great.  Can&#x27;t fault the product because this girl didn&#x27;t check the size ahead of time! :)</li>
    <li> It was difficult to find powder puffs in stores; was happy to find these in Amazon.  The size works well for my box and powder seems to stick better than others I&#x27;ve had.  They are not too fluffy nor is the nap too short; just right!</li>
    <li> These work but they are large and they feel like synthetic material but for the price that is ok!</li>
    <li> They were very small---  not as pictured</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted a great price</li>
    <li> Very cheaply made. The handle is not secure and broke off instantly.</li>
    <li> Listed at 4 inches wide .... might make 3 inches. You get more powder on your hands then you do on the puff. Unsatisfactory to say the least.</li>
    <li> exactly what I have been looking for.  love them.</li>
    <li> WISH THEY WERE BIGGER. NICE THOUGH...</li>
    <li> good product, just as described. The puffs are fluffy and they are the size that they were said to be.</li>
    <li> I make my own body powder and these are perfect to include with gifts jars of powder.</li>
    <li> Nice set of powder puffs, good size, quality seems fine.</li>
    <li> These are great and soft. The material feels luxurious. I have only started using them but seems like they are made well and will last long (though its good to change your powder puff every month). They fit perfectly in my powder box! Glad to have found them on Amazon since it so difficult to find powder puffs in stores!</li>
    <li> They got the job done.</li>
    <li> Good quality replacements for what I was using</li>
    <li> These puffs were exactly what I expected.  Not high quality but will serve the purpose just fine.  Arrived quickly with no problems.  Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price.  Accurately described and pictured. Puffs are not the highest in quality, but then I didn&#x27;t expect to get &amp;#34;cashmere at polyester prices&amp;#34;. Great size (larger than I anticipated) so can be used for a variety of applications, and I appreciate that it comes as a set of 3 because it allows me to designate puffs for specific purposes. I have used only dry products so cannot speak to wet applications, and I have not yet tried to wash them so can not address ease of cleaning.  However, I am very pleased with their performance thus far and would repurchase.</li>
    <li> Rec&#x27;d as described and on time. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Just what I&#x27;ve been looking for for sometime</li>
    <li> Solved my problem with using cans of powder. Much better way of powdering oneself</li>
    <li> Very soft and met more than my expectations.</li>
    <li> works just fine...wish they made them a bit larger</li>
    <li> Great quality just a lot bigger than i ever expected !</li>
