      <li>Very small...not worth the money....</li>
      <li>I was expecting an actual crystal and what I received was more like a piece of plastic.  </li>
      <li>Even more so than some of my bigger moldavites.  </li>
      <li>Appears authentic, but is a sliver...1/2&amp;#34; at its widest and 1&amp;#34; long  and about 1/8 inch at its thickest with ends that taper to a point and weighs almost nothing.  </li>

      <li>am very desapointed</li>

      <li>I highly suggest that when buying moldavite online - you educate yourself on what you are looking for.</li>
      <li>Small tiny piece...not thrilled.  </li>
      <li>The item was so tiny it looked like a chip that fell off the real crystal when someone dropped it.  </li>
      <li>but i what I expected given how rare of a stone it is.</li>
      <li>A very tiny piece of a stone - which is completely overpriced!&lt;br</li>
      <li>Never expected such a miniature piece.  </li>

    <li> FAKE FAKE FAKE!!!! NEVER AGAIN</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what it was I actually received, but it was definitely not moldavite. It looked like a tiny piece of broken black glass. And I mean tiny! Very disappointing! Buyers beware when ordering crystals online! Better to shop for stones in person at an actual store.</li>
    <li> The moldavite is small but it has an amazing energy to it! The price was very affordable. Sometimes people complain about the cost and size of moldavite stones, but I have to say the one I have is very small but highly charged. Even more so than some of my bigger moldavites.  So, I am very happy with my purchase!</li>

    <li> Appears authentic, but is a sliver...1/2&amp;#34; at its widest and 1&amp;#34; long  and about 1/8 inch at its thickest with ends that taper to a point and weighs almost nothing.  I had hoped it would be larger.</li>
    <li> I highly suggest that when buying moldavite online - you educate yourself on what you are looking for. You can tell from this picture that someone to make glass look like moldavite. Also the price is a dead giveaway. Authentic moldavite is pricy and you have to be willing to pay because the s*** ain&#x27;t cheap.</li>
