      <li>I love them.</li>
      <li>but I love wearing them when I go out....</li>
      <li>ever i get some many complements</li>
      <li>and they aren&#x27;t over the top.</li>
      <li>They are incredible quality and the silicone band makes them very flexible, super day to apply and very easy to trim as needed.</li>
      <li>Natural hair, looked beautiful.</li>
      <li>Having free shipping with Amazon Prime is a lovely added bonus.</li>
      <li>Great natural looking lashes</li>

      <li>These lashes hold up so well, easy application, and they never fell off</li>
      <li>Great lashes not too over the top just about enough.</li>
      <li>Easy application, as if they had magnets on the strips that were attracted to the lash line of my models and clients.</li>
      <li>Glad to stock up for special occasions.</li>
      <li>They make my eyes huge</li>
      <li>hope you enjoy.</li>
      <li>But they look fabulous.</li>
      <li>Thank you Was fantastic.</li>
      <li>easy to apply nice and soft.  </li>
      <li>Red cherry by far has the best strip lashes.</li>
      <li>plus they clean up</li>
      <li>i got so many compliments!&lt;br /&gt;shipped super fast!</li>
      <li>I already loved the brand but this deal was such a steal</li>
      <li>These are the right fit for me.</li>
      <li>Love this brand and this particular style.</li>
      <li>They are easy to use, I recommend to anyone who wants to try lashes.</li>
      <li>They are dramatic and beautiful, but not over the top.</li>
      <li>Wish there was a way that I could have a set permanently stuck where my real lashes are without going to get them filled every couple weeks</li>
      <li>/&gt;The lashes were too short for my eye, I didn&#x27;t liked them.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
      <li>Truly worth the money</li>
      <li>I love how they look so natural.</li>
      <li>Ordered these lashes on Friday and recieved them today right before Halloween.</li>
      <li>Long and natural looking :) love it</li>

      <li>Would luv these ;)</li>
      <li>favorite red cherry eyelashes are 43, 82, and 103.  </li>
      <li>they look so natural !!!!</li>
      <li>For most people the length should be just fine, but because I have smaller eyes, they&#x27;re too big.</li>
      <li>SUPER NATURAL LOOKING like the ardell demi wispies!</li>
      <li>Also, since I have more of a hooded lid, the lashes are way too long.</li>
      <li>These appear to be authentic Red Cherry lashes that I had paid a high price for in salon around town.</li>
      <li>Nice quality product and very pretty but entirely too long.</li>
      <li>so I do a half lash kind of deal with them.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Everytime I try n re Order eyelashes the prices keeps going up</li>
    <li> I LOVE THESE!!!!!  They are the best.  Red Cherry rocks.  #43 is the most beautiful lash I have seen.</li>
    <li> Favorite lashes and I have used sooo many fake eyelashes. Wish there was a way that I could have a set permanently stuck where my real lashes are without going to get them filled every couple weeks</li>
    <li> I think Red Cherry brand is in my top five brands for eyelashes and #43 are 2nd  of my favorites they look beautiful on they make a beautiful look with a smokey eye love love love... will order more as I  always do to make sure there on hand so I don&#x27;t run out !!!!  5 Stars.....</li>
    <li> I really like Red Cherry lashes they&#x27;re the best!  They&#x27;re real human  hair so the look natural. Plus they&#x27;re very reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> very natural looking lashes out there hands down.  Came across them from seeing them worn by emilynoel in youtube.  very pleased with the quality.</li>
    <li> Long and natural looking :) love it</li>
    <li> I love these lashes! They look so natural!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping very nice eyelashes!&lt;br /&gt;My favorite red cherry eyelashes are 43, 82, and 103.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with these, because they are all very natural!</li>
    <li> It seems long to look natural so I just trimmed it a little since the other end is as long as my lashes. Though it definitely made such a dramatic look and helped thinken the look of my lashes! Glad to stock up for special occasions.</li>
    <li> Shipping on my order was fast! Price was great. I absolutly love these lashes !!I&#x27;ve tried so many other brands and styles but these have to be my favorite</li>
    <li> I have ordered several styles of the Red Cherry line (wispies, 747s) and on #43 I get the most compliments. Truly worth the money plus they clean up so well you can wear them again and again. I love the gradual flirty change from the shorter lashes to the longer ends towards the outer edges of your eye - really makes them pop!&lt;br /&gt;If you are thinking about buying them, quit waiting - it is a great price for a great product.</li>
    <li> Love them! they r the best ones out there #43 Soo i Think who eva loves lashes! Would luv these ;)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m absolutely in love with these lashes. I would buy more after I run out. Best quality and worth having.</li>
    <li> I wear false eyelashes almost everyday and I love these! They are perfectly sized so I don&#x27;t have to cut them and they aren&#x27;t over the top. I will be ordering again and again!</li>
    <li> Loved these!  Let me know when you have more!</li>
    <li> Love them every time.  Perfect lashes, and I love the people that send them to me.  They always do an amazing job and are always courteous and do great business. :)  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I like them but I don&#x27;t see the rave over the style. I would repurchase from the seller but not this style.</li>
    <li> These lashes hold up so well, easy application, and they never fell off (I normally apply it with the duo glue)~ and the price is much cheaper than those in the mall.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend it !</li>
    <li> I really like the option to buy bulk on Amazon. Having free shipping with Amazon Prime is a lovely added bonus. Love this brand and this particular style. It&#x27;s my go to falsies....day or night.</li>
    <li> people LOVED these on me!! i got so many compliments!&lt;br /&gt;shipped super fast!</li>
    <li> Love them!!! Like many say, a little too dramatic for everyday use but I love wearing them when I go out.... also, I like how they feel, they&#x27;re super soft.</li>
    <li> These appear to be authentic Red Cherry lashes that I had paid a high price for in salon around town. I&#x27;ve never bought this particular size before, so I was a little dissapointed to see how long they are. Only because I have teeny tiny eyes. I&#x27;ve yet to wear them. But they look fabulous. Hopefully they&#x27;ll work out for a fancy night out :)</li>
    <li> These lashes are amazing, but they are a bit too dramatic. Also, since I have more of a hooded lid, the lashes are way too long. I even trimmed them, but they still are really long. For most people the length should be just fine, but because I have smaller eyes, they&#x27;re too big. It looked like I had black eyes</li>
    <li> Natural hair, looked beautiful. Easy application, as if they had magnets on the strips that were attracted to the lash line of my models and clients. Looked amazing on, stayed on well. I apply them after eye makeup application and then apply a coat of liquid liner to seal the deal. Perfect. Will definitely buy these again, and gave pair to my mua colleague I was so impressed. I also give the container to my client so she can store them to use again bc it would be a waste to throw these little darlings away after one use if they&#x27;re still in good shape.</li>
    <li> Great lashes not too over the top just about enough.</li>
    <li> Great. Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> eyelashes are my addiction. I do single and individual lashes on myself as well as others. Red cherry by far has the best strip lashes. For amateurs (people who don&#x27;t really wear lashes I usually advise a #1 or a #15 in red cherry ) but for people who want a everyday nice clean feminine look I advise a #747M, #415 or #43. they all work wonders. Ladies make sure the glue is semi dry before applying the lashes. otherwise theyll slide around. i usally apply the glue shower then get out and put them on (just a suggestion) . hope you enjoy.</li>
    <li> Nice quality product and very pretty but entirely too long. They would work great as a Halloween costume type accessory. I wish they were shorter since I have so many of them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m asian, I make youtube videos as anhbear and these are fabulous!  The  quality is comparable to Ardell lashes.  Band invisible and contour is perfect for my eye shape.  EASY APPLICATION.  Lasts several uses depending on how well you take care of them.  SUPER NATURAL LOOKING like the ardell demi wispies!</li>
    <li> These are the right fit for me. I bought the #43 and they were too long and to light.</li>
    <li> Loved the product so i re-ordered. Never got it..</li>
    <li> Love these lashes! They look natural and aren&#x27;t as heavy as other false lashes absolute must have!</li>
    <li> These are nice quality. I have hooded eyes &amp; they are way too long for me. They make me look like a drag queen.</li>
    <li> best eyelashes ever i get some many complements they look so natural !!!!</li>
    <li> easy to apply nice and soft.  They make my eyes huge and I dont need to cut them down.</li>
    <li> Item arrived quick, great eyelashes that aren&#x27;t too dramatic, and was a little cheaper to buy on amazon than in any store. Would buy again!</li>
    <li> Thank you Was fantastic.</li>
    <li> This lashes are flawless! They are dramatic but look natural. They are easy to use, I recommend to anyone who wants to try lashes. I get compliments on these all the time and people think they are real.</li>
    <li> Love them wear them all the time</li>
    <li> The lashes are great. I already loved the brand but this deal was such a steal i couldn&#x27;t pass it up. everything arrived on time and intact. not complaints whatsoever.</li>
    <li> I love these lashes and the look so amazing on. They are very comfortable. I recently wore them for NYE and they lasted through the whole night! They give you amazing fluttery lashes without feeling heavy or uncomfortable on your eyes. If you treat them gently, they can definitely last a couple times. I highly recommend these. I will repurchase when I am done with this set.</li>
    <li> these are the  best lashes i have ever used. they hold up very well for reapplication.  im on the sixth wearing of my current pair.</li>
    <li> I love my 43 they are so natural &#x27;</li>
    <li> excellent quality, works for me..would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Great natural looking lashes</li>
    <li> I use these on my clients who range from brides, personal events, holiday wear, Eric. Perfect for natural drama, a little heavy for some people. But awesome product and would recommend!</li>
    <li> It arrived too late even though I paid extra to have it earlier.&lt;br /&gt;The lashes were too short for my eye, I didn&#x27;t liked them.&lt;br /&gt;Now I don&#x27;t know what to do with the 11 pairs remaining.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
    <li> I love them! Thank you! They&#x27;re short so I do a half lash kind of deal with them. I love them. Natural looking!</li>
    <li> I love how they look so natural. I will be ordering again (:</li>
    <li> These lanes are a staple at my photography studio. They are dramatic and beautiful, but not over the top. The look natural enough to not discourage first time lash wearers and still add that extra pop to eyes. They are incredible quality and the silicone band makes them very flexible, super day to apply and very easy to trim as needed.</li>
    <li> A great every day lash if your a glam-gurl!</li>
    <li> If you have almond shaped, hooded eyes... DO NOT buy these! These lashes make me look like a tramp. They are sooo long! They are really dense as well. The lashes literally touch my eyebrows. I have no idea how people double up on lashes with these things. I bought the 747s and like those much better.</li>
    <li> Ordered these lashes on Friday and recieved them today right before Halloween. These lashes are perfect ❤️</li>
