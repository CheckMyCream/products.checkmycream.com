<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Wrapped well smells good and works good</li>
    <li> I have been tanning for 10 years and have tried many different indoor lotions and this is by far the best one I have tried!!! It smells absolutely great and I can tell a huge difference in my tan. I usually start tanning every season in Feburary and it takes til about May to get to the darkness I like but I have already acheived that this season and I started using this lotion about 2 1/2 weeks ago. I will never try another lotion again. This will be my Go-To lotion every season!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Product was recieved in very reasonable time no problems with any packaging and the product works amazing!!! I would highly recommend this to anyone trying to get ready for summer time!</li>
    <li> I first tried a packet and decided to buy the bottle as I was tanning for vacation and needed something quickly. I absolutely love this lotion. No streaks, even color, and smells amazing afterwards. Its helped me to get pretty dark within a months time of tanning maybe 3-4 days a week then going down to once or twice. The color lasts and looks natural, not gross and orange. Ill definitely be buying another bottle!</li>
    <li> Love this! Arrived promptly and works like magic! Highly recommend to anyone! Was told by the owner of the tanning salon I use that she could tell a difference in my tan &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> When I saw this lotion was under $30 I was so excited because it was $65 at my salon and I really wanted to try it.  I received the lotion rather quickly, a day sooner than the date they gave me.  It is a large bottle with a great design.  The lotion has a good smell to it, which I think smells like strawberries and cream, and it doesn&#x27;t stink when you get out of the bed.  However, i was a little disappointed that it didn&#x27;t get me darker since it is a \\&quot;dark black bronzer\\&quot;.  It did establish a great base tan.  I do still use this lotion on occasion, when I don&#x27;t use my tingle lotion, its just not my favorite (which I have yet to find a lotion I love).</li>
    <li> Highly recommened!!!  You want to get dark fast this is the product to use.  I am light skinned but after using this for a few times I&#x27;m pretty tan.  The smells of this lotion is very refreshing.</li>
    <li> Pretty sure this lotion is FAKE! The smell was fine it smelt like strawberry smoothies until after you tanned the smell changed. The first time I used it it was fine but then after my second to third time I started itching like crazy!! Even after I took a shower and haven&#x27;t gone in a couple days I&#x27;m still itching!! I would NOT buy this lotion! Waste of money!!</li>
    <li> I could tell a diffrence within two uses. it is worth the money best lotion I have used. You won&#x27;t notice as soon ad you get out but give it about an hour then you WILL tell a diffrence.:-)</li>
    <li> Just bought the lotion and used for the first time today, i was sceptical becuz i have tried so many different lotions that left me less than satisfied, but the lotion does smell good an doesnt stink after tanning. I couldnt tell if it made me any darker after just using it once, but i will post update after a few days (my daughter also used it an she did look a little darker)</li>
    <li> I have been tanning for about a month now, and have been an on and off tanner for a couple of years. When I started tanning recently my gf recommended this lotion and I bought it right away. It came super fast! I noticed a nice golden color after the first or second use. It smells great too.. There is a little \\&quot;burnt\\&quot; smell after tanning but it fades quickly. The girl at my tanning salon says it smells wonderful when I&#x27;m tanning :) anyways, I had such great results with this lotion and have a beautiful base tan that I just ordered the hot tingle lotion by Snooki. I cannot wait to try it out!!!</li>
    <li> i just got this today of course i had a good base tan before i buaght this item but i wanted to get darker i just used it for the first time 30 minutes ago and i can tell a noticable difference i love it already and plus it smells wonderful during and after tanning and my skin and soft too :)</li>
    <li> I am fair skinned and bought this product to darken up before going to Mexico.  It is streaky and dries out my skin.  I look like I have alligator skin or large freckles and have to get a spray tan to cover the mess.</li>
    <li> With years of tanning and spending large amounts of money on tanning lotion, this is by far the best lotion &amp; the cheapest lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. It doesn&#x27;t smell the greatest, I don&#x27;t like how your skin feels afterwards, but this is the darkest I&#x27;ve ever been from laying in a tanning bed &amp; I&#x27;ve noticed my skin is much softer. Not to mention most places charge $40.00 or more for it. This was a great buy!</li>
    <li> I was really skeptical buying this lotion because it was so cheap compared to my previously bought lotions and the fact that it&#x27;s endorsed by snooki, but all the girls at my tanning salon raved about it! It&#x27;s actually a really good lotion with a nice sweet candy smell and is very moisturizing. I got great color after only two sessions! You really can&#x27;t beat the price of it too, considering other lotions I have purchased have run me $80 + and given the same results. Would definitely recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> I got this product today and used it for the first time and it was fantastic!!!! The only thing is it says it doesnt prevent sunburn. Does everyone else that uses it only use the bronzer and do not get burned or do you use something glese with it?</li>
    <li> Hey everyone! I just bought the Snooki lotion and love it! And the price on here is unbeatable. At the tanning place my love and i go to, it&#x27;s $65 so great deal. Not to mention I was super satisfied with the time it took to receive. I was bummed cuz i picked the longest (cheapest) delivery date but was surprised i got it the very next morning before i woke up! Amazon is always super fast! But anyways, the Snooki lotion smells great and the first time I used it, i looked black haha jk i also ordered the Obsidian tanning lotion with the warm volcanic minerals (which is $126 in tanning place) on here for the hubby and he loves it. no complaints. but yes i recommend :) thanks amazon! i will continue shopping with you!</li>
    <li> I love my Snooki tanning lotion! And I would recommend it to anyone that loves bronzer In their tanning lotion :)</li>
    <li> Loved this product! Smells great and applies evenly. Ive been tanning since i was 14 im now 22 and have used every lotion under the sun, and by far best one in years! Would reccommend strongley to advanced and beginer tanners! Tan on!</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion. It works good and smells good. Delivery was fast. I was overall very happy I choose to make this purchase.</li>
    <li> As someone who lays in the tanning bed daily for about 6 months about of the year I feel I know quite a bit about tanning/lotions and what works and what doesn&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve probably tried every single one of them. haha&lt;br /&gt;I avoided buying this one for years just because of all of the hype around the name. No matter how many great reviews I read about it, I just always felt it was because of the name, that&#x27;s why people loved it, but I was so so wrong!&lt;br /&gt;I had a bottle given to me and used it and NOTHING has EVER worked better than this stuff! I have hard to tan skin and this makes me SUPER dark SUPER quick! I was an idiot for not buying it as soon as it came out! All that nice tan I missed out on! ugh!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s now been years, and it&#x27;s the ONLY tanning lotion that I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;ve tried a few of her other ones, but NOTHING works like this little baby right here! If you want the perfect bronze dark tan, then you want this right here! Period! NOTHING is better. NOTHING!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the 2012 Snooki Ultra Dark Black Bronzer Tanning Lotion. If your looking for a deep dark tan this is the lotion your looking for. Great results!</li>
    <li> This lotion works awesome!! Ive been tanning for about 2 months and wanted to get a bronze looking tan! Within 3 tans i could tell a huge difference!! I am very pleased with this lotion. Im planning on trying snookis tingle next!!</li>
    <li> Best deal ever and works immediately</li>
    <li> I already had a pretty good base tan i just needed that extra bronzer and this did it! It did&#x27;nt leave my streaky or orange and the smell is not bad either.</li>
    <li> Ok so i have tried so many different tanning lotions because i am SUPER WHITE. im talking like a piece of paper white.  So i heard that Snooki Tanning lotion was really awesome. So i figured that since her being the Queen of TAN let me give it a try.  I did, and im telling you i noticed a difference in a few days.  not incredibly dark after a few days but you can tell im atleast 4 shades darker than what i was.  Now after using Snooki tanning for about a month im ready to buy a whole case so i can continue to have it! I would def recommend this tanning lotion to Anyone!!! I love it!</li>
    <li> After buying the tanning lotion from Jwoww I thought it couldn&#x27;t get any better but I&#x27;m SO GLAD I stumbled upon this lotion by Snooki! I, who was quite pale, got dark within a week in a half. Seriously. It&#x27;s that good! This lotion will not disappoint, my mom even uses it. Its worth every penny!!</li>
    <li> Makes you look tan after 3 sessions (some even the first time). I am Dutch with fair skin. I didn&#x27;t burn and have an even glow. Highly recommend to any skin type. There is bronzed in it so make sure to wipe your hands after applying.</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion when I was in the beginning of my tanning season. It is perfect to get some initial color. Smells great and is very reasonable price wise!</li>
    <li> This is a great tanning lotion...smells great and gives you a dark color. Snooki knows what she&#x27;s doing with this product!</li>
    <li> I love the lotion and Amazon has the best price but I feel the price is still to high. The girls at my tanning salon told me to purchase it on Amazon because the salon&#x27;s price was really expensive!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read reviews about other users  tans washing off and what not - that is what happens with a bronzer. If you want a lot of instant ACTUAL color, your best bet is to go with a tingle lotion. Bronzers are the same ingredient that are in self tanners and they wash off within a couple days of applcation. I use this lotion in combination with a tingle and a maximizer and it works great, but keep in mind the color you are getting is not all natural color. This lotion doesn&#x27;t smell afterward and moisturizes great. I like it to rotate with my other lotions. I hate all three Snooki lotions and get great results using all three. Also, lotions work differently on everyone - so you can&#x27;t beat being able to try something for the price on Amazon! The price in my salon is almost three times as expensive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle came packaged and delivery was quick. I would order from this company again.</li>
    <li> def a big fan of snooki so i bought the lotion. it smells good and doesnt have a forever lasting odor like other lotions. i have my own tanning bed and as soon as i received it i used and and could tell within laying about 20 min that i was getting darker. def worth the price and the tan is lovely!</li>
    <li> This lotion is amazing! I am getting so tan with it. It smells awesome, i look awesome and its just amazing!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been tanning for like the last 3 months. I&#x27;ve been getting some color but I wanted to be brown instead of just \\&quot;not pale.\\&quot; I tried other tanning lotions that were just whatever and the tanning salon lady recommended this over the jwoww and pauly d lotions. I&#x27;ve used it about 5 times so far and I can see a HUGE difference. I love it and will continue to buy it! Just make sure to rub it in super even otherwise it looks like a bad spray tan.</li>
    <li> Lotion smells FABULOUS...before and after tanning. Does not leave you smelling burnt. It leaves your skin soft and smooth. I am a \\&quot;professional\\&quot; tanner and am very pleased with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Smelled okay but after a few weeks of using it didn&#x27;t seem to get much darker. Have tried many tanning lotions and this surely is not my favorite, will not be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I tan about twice a week, and tan quite easily.&lt;br /&gt;pros: inexpensive, smells nice, non-greasy, instant tan-bronzers&lt;br /&gt;cons: tan doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
    <li> I have a hard time finding a tanning lotion I love but I found one! This lotion is amazing! I love the smell and it gets me super dark super fast!</li>
    <li> I was hoping this worked really good. I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference. Smells good, goes on good. My bottle was not factory sealed so, I&#x27;m not sure about it. But I wasn&#x27;t impressed after one use. Fast shipment.</li>
    <li> I order this on Tuesday &amp; recieved it Thursday! I will defiently be ordering from this company again! I&#x27;ve tried a sample of this lotion &amp; loved it so I ordered it. I&#x27;m sure I will get the same results as the sample. Thanks so much for the fast service!</li>
    <li> I purchased this lotion a week ago (used it twice) for $20 less than the salon had it for sale. I really like it. It has a nice almost \\&quot;candy like\\&quot; smell that isn&#x27;t too strong or fruity. I love how it left my skin feeling silky and not sticky. It was not streaky and did not turn my hands a color. Only complaint is I wish there was a little more bronzer in it since I don&#x27;t tan easily. Overall I would buy this product again and anticipate good results.</li>
    <li> I impulse bought this at my tanning salon as it was brand new there when I bought it. Smells great, but that&#x27;s it. I have used a ton of lotions over almost a decade of tanning and this is the only one that has ever broke me out. I was itchy for 2 days after using this. I tried it again and again and same thing happens every time. Plus it doesn&#x27;t enhance your tan at all.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this tanning lotion. It smells great and actually bronzes you really well. And no, it doesn&#x27;t turn you orange. The packaging of the bottle is so cute as well! The product came in like a week on standard shipping! A MUST buy if you tan frequently!</li>
    <li> This lotion smells sooo good! Works so well with indoor tanning beds and gets you dark in a short amount of time. Awesome product!</li>
    <li> super cute bottle and it smells yummy, but has far as tanning, i couldnt real tell any difference right then. could tell a little the next day. kind still up n the air about wither i would buy this lotion again. but the seller is top notch. great seller and will use again and again.</li>
    <li> I did research before buying this item and it&#x27;s lived up to the praise. I love the smell of it, plus it&#x27;s not super greasy, and most of all it works!</li>
    <li> DO NOT PURCHASE THIS LOTION! I first received my lotion I was a little shocked, you could tell by the bottle it was a \\&quot;knock off\\&quot; or if it was the real thing it was really low quality. Ignoring the initial disappointment I decided to try the lotion anyway. I have been using the same bed for the maximum time for months but as soon as I got in my face started BURNING!!! My entire face felt like it was on fire and when I got out of the bed my face was so red the employee actually said something about it as I was exiting the salon, and my face had a little rash for the next day. I do have sensitive skin so I thought that maybe it was just my skin so I gave it to one of my friends to try, the same exact thing happened to her. We have both used the tingling lotions before which this was nothing like that, this made you feel like your skin was burning off and you were raw, it even hurts to the touch. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS LOTION!</li>
    <li> I went to the tanning bed for about 60 days almost everyday and this didn&#x27;t give me the tan I thought it should give me.</li>
    <li> This took me from light dark to dark!</li>
    <li> I was a lil impressedwhen I started using this..two weeks in I noticed a \\&quot;line\\&quot; as though I was closing my arm while tanning...when I took a shower and dried off I wiped my tan away...I waited 4 hrs before showering .and of all the products I&#x27;ve used this has never happened. Glad I didn&#x27;t spend 60 bucks on it..:-(</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my purchase of Snooki&#x27;s dark bronzing tanning lotion! it really works and does NOT turn you orange. Makes my skin feel so soft and when I go tanning a couple days in a row, i get SO dark. it&#x27;s awesome. Definitely would recommend to use!</li>
    <li> Caked this lotion and tanned for 20 minutes w/no results! I will stick with jwow cause I see results after every use and it smells better. I was hoping this would give me fast results and a more brown color since I&#x27;ve been off tanning awhile. Id rather use jwow for immediate results. + about this is pretty bottle</li>
    <li> I have only used it twice but so far so good! It has a nice smell when you put it on and doesn&#x27;t make you orange.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent lotion but would not recommend buying it here.  Not only does it not enhance tanning, it&#x27;s almost like there is sunscreen in it.  No tan at all for me!</li>
    <li> So I was skeptical, can you blame me?! But I ended up loving  this lotion! The first time in I got great color! And I can&#x27;t wait to get to where I want to be, which I feel like with this lotion may only take about 4 times. Pleasent smell also! You don&#x27;t come out smelling like burnt skin with the usual lotions. Make sure you don&#x27;t shower for atleast 2 hours after tanning, it has bronzers in it, and taking a shower will wash your gorgeous tan right off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this in the salon for a \\&quot;pretty penny\\&quot; I&#x27;ll make sure to purchase it from here next time!</li>
    <li> My salon was selling this, but I refused to buy it due to the high price of $65 + tax. So I bought it from Amazon for about $40 (I see it&#x27;s even cheaper now).&lt;br /&gt;I do not feel a tingle as some others claim they do. I also do not see a difference in my tanning. It really doesn&#x27;t make me darker. Maybe for the same day, I&#x27;m SLIGHTLY more bronzed. But I can get that with Jergens Natural Glow &amp; it&#x27;s alot cheaper. So I&#x27;m sticking with Jergens. The only thing I like about Snooki bronzer is that it smells good. When I leave the tanning salon, I actually get compliments on how good I smell.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe \\&quot;Snooki\\&quot; should consider trying to make this into a body scent cream instead of a bronzer (&amp; give me half for coming up w/ the idea)! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! Smells WONDERFUL, also it tans WONDERFUL. It is TOP quality. I will be using this ALWAYS! You will not be dissappointed.&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU Snooki, GOOD job!</li>
    <li> Great smell and not watery, seems to be working glad I saved over half the price on here. Very happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> I have only used this tanning lotion 3 times and not only are others noticing that I am getting darker, but I am also noticing. Very happy with this product! Also, this is a non tingle lotion, WHICH I LOVE!</li>
    <li> Really help my daughter with getting tan for her JR. Prom. She was happy with the results.  Thank you&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Donna Rhoton</li>
    <li> Made me kind of orange but still gave me color I liked!</li>
    <li> Smells amazing, gives you the caramel color you want, plus gives your skin the moisture it needs. Just love it!</li>
    <li> I read alot of reviews before buying this. i feel like it hasn&#x27;t helped me get any tanner I haven&#x27;t noticed anything diff. I won&#x27;t buy this again! smells good thats tje only thing from the reviews that I have found true!</li>
    <li> Love the texture of the lotion, the smell, the overall quality. I&#x27;m very satisfied I would definitely recommend to family and friends.</li>
    <li> Always love this stuff...</li>
    <li> Out of all the other tanning lotions I have tried, this stuff seems to be the best I have used. :-)</li>
    <li> Didnt arrive on time but I recieved it today used it at the gym tanning bed smells great and worked pretty well for a first time use. Cant wait to use every time I go to the gym</li>
    <li> One of the best on the market. Great color, great scent, great texture. Tanning is my guilty pleasure and I always revert back to this lotion. Snooki is my go to girl!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m overly disappointed. I got it for a great price but something tells me I didn&#x27;t get what I paid for. I guess the first time you use this you&#x27;re most likely to get great results, I&#x27;ve been tanning for a month now &amp; it didn&#x27;t enhance my tan what so ever. When I got it, it had a piece of clear tape on it &amp; I got it from TanMan or something like that. I see all these great reviews.. I&#x27;d like to purchase a bottle from wherever they got it because it&#x27;s obviously helping them out.</li>
    <li> Smells great. A little orange</li>
    <li> I got this to try in between the JWOWW bottles.  I can&#x27;t really tell any difference.  Seems like there is more quantity in the JWOWW.  It is a good bronzer but I just don&#x27;t think it is any different from the others I&#x27;m using.  I&#x27;ll still use it though.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and it tans me after 2 times. I dont have to lay as much due to using this lotion!</li>
    <li> Very happy with everything i have got</li>
    <li> Snooki definitely made me very tan!!  I let my friends use it too and they all loved it and bought some.</li>
    <li> Luv it! My salon was all sold out of this so glad I found it on Amazon!;) if you indoor tan definately try this lotion!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product it did exactly what they said it it would do. I will buy it again, great scent  as well.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this lotion and if you use it in a tanning bed you don&#x27;t come out with that awful after scent it definitely covers all of that up and in the sun if feels amazing, I helped me achieve the color I was hoping for and give me that summer glow. it also does not have the greasy feeling and leaves your skin feeling soft.</li>
    <li> I have only used this one time and can tell a difference and I&#x27;ve been an active tanner for about 2 months now! The smell is great and left my skin feeling so soft! Defiantly surprised :)</li>
    <li> So much cheaper on amazon than the stuff the salons sell. I didn&#x27;t notice a difference after the first use, but I did with every tanning session after that. People have said it doesn&#x27;t have that &#x27;tanned skin&#x27; smell after a tanning session to it, but it does (I think it&#x27;s just an inevitable part of tanning). The only difference I saw was that I really only noticed that smell in the shower at the end of my day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical about getting someone&#x27;s used lotion but this came shrink-wrapped and was clearly unused. Overall I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> I was afraid to purchase this thinking it may have been a knock off but I can definitely tell is the real deal definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Sender sent late. After I asked for them not to send they sent it anyway but asked if I wanted it still. I said yes. But for the delayed shipping they reimbursed me half the total price. Great product.  Works very well. I&#x27;d buy from them again! Excellent product. Nice seller. Thank you again for being so generous. :)</li>
    <li> I am super pale and almost glow in the dark and this lotion bronzes without looking orange, actually smells GREAT and boosts my tan a lot. Wouldn&#x27;t use any other lotion. Snooki had an awesome team of people to come up with this because generally, when you think of Snooki &amp;#34;great quality&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;not orange&amp;#34; don&#x27;t come to mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But seriously, best tanning lotion ever.</li>
    <li> I started using Supre Snooki Black Bronzer a few years ago. Since the first bottle, I have NOT ever gone back to any other brand of bronzer. The bronzer gives a beautiful bronze tone to your skin. As long as Supre Snooki Black Bronzer is available, I will NEVER use another product. It is the absolute best. The fragrance is wonderful and the product works well. I would recommend this product to those who like a beautiful bronzing result &amp; enjoy a wonderful fragrance. Many fragrances of bronzers do not smell good after tanning, but this one doesn&#x27;t smell bad, at all. I received the product, as described and earlier than expected!!! I hope this product continues to be offered on Amazon. It is much cheaper than the tanning salons, and works the same!!! :-)</li>
    <li> I have been tanning for a while and have never had the issues I am having. I am getting bumps on my arms and stomach. I itch so bad it makes me never want to tan again. And to top it off my skin is super dry.</li>
    <li> I chose to buy this lotion because it smells great. I was taking a chance by purchasing online. Came in great condition. New. And I use it all the time. Love the porduct</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this lotion and smells amazing. I highly recommend for any tanning lovers wanting that golden brown tan and has fast results.</li>
    <li> I barely know who Snooki is and yet purchased this for my good friend for a Christmas present.  It smells nice and sells for around $70 in the tanning salon we visit.  Can&#x27;t beat the deal here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I really liked this tanning oil. It does not streak and it smells very good. I would recommend buying this for inside tanning. I have a slight tan complexion and this made me very dark after using it 2-3 times.</li>
    <li> This was such a great price for what you get ! It came right on time and matched other reviews!  No issues with the seller and has kept be bronze and smells delicious :)</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion on a Sunday &amp; received it on Tuesday! Super fast shipping! I was relieved to notice this is the real deal. Some said this lotion was watery and smelled bad. Not true! This lotion is thick and the smell is fruity &amp; not overly strong. I have tanned twice with this lotion &amp; already have a base tan, but there is DHA (self tanner) in it. This lotion is way cheaper through Amazon, it was 65 bucks in my salon! I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many tanning lotions and this has got to be the best one I have ever used. The smell is amazing and after I get out on the tanning bed the smell remains the same as when I first got it. It tans me evenly and people always ask what kind of lotion I use, and I always tell this about this product! I cannot wait to buy more!</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews on this lotion I thought I would give it a try, it had great reviews. I love this product! It gives me great color after a couple of tans, and the smell of it is very pleasing. It is nice to tan and be able to go to work and not smell like burnt skin, which some lotions leave behind. I will be trying the whole line of Snooki products!</li>
    <li> I am a frequent tanner and am always looking for the next best thing in indoor tanning lotions...Snooki Ultra Dark Black Bronzer is the BEST I have used this year!  Make sure you buy it on Amazon...don&#x27;t pay salon price like I did :-( duh.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this lotion.  I have used it 3 times so far and I have a much richer tan than I had before.  The scent is nice and not over powering.  I tan on my lunch hour and I haven&#x27;t experienced that nasty after tanning bed smell with this lotion.  It does not streak and adds a boost of bronzer with each application.  I hope they sell this for years to come.  Will def. buy again.</li>
    <li> There is a reason this lotion is cheap. Has a ton of bronzers which is really nice but hated the way it felt when you put it on and dries your skin out. There is not enough skin care in this at all, but you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> If you order this lotion be careful, a lot of fake lotion is being sold. If you never had it b4 u will not know. I have had the real stuff, and this stuff on here is not real. Be careful.Glamour tanning company is selling fake stuff for sure.</li>
    <li> I own my own tanning bed...I&#x27;ve tried several different tanning lotions. Many I&#x27;ve been very pleased with. However, after having a base, and using this lotion one time, I&#x27;m more than satisfied. This bottle of creamy heaveness is more than perfect. I noticed a difference with one use! I will absolutely be ordering more, and I most certainaly recommend this Snookie perfectness!</li>
    <li> This lotion is amazing! It smells great, works good, and makes your tan bronzer! The lotion is a must have if you like to go tanning !!! It&#x27;s easy to use no more dark lines from not rubbing in the lotion good.</li>
    <li> This is a great tanning lotion. It smells amazing, doesn&#x27;t turn me orange or streak and feels good too!! Snooki did something right...absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing, great bronzers! it&#x27;s $75 in tanning salon $20 on here can&#x27;t go wrong buying this lotion it&#x27;s my fav</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this lotion because I am in love with JWOWW&#x27;s products, and I decided to give Snooki&#x27;s a try. I was impressed, it smells delicious, like candy or dessert! After tanning, there is no burnt skin smell, and it makes my skin feel velvety. I have only used it twice and so far I am happy with the color. I would definitely buy this lotion again. Good job, Snooki.</li>
    <li> It made me itch so bad? My face felt like it was on fire? I&#x27;ve never had a reaction like that in my life? It was HORRIBLE!!!</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed the scent of this lotion.  It smells like juicy gummy bears.  It makes my skin feel moisturized.. not silky smooth though.  I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference in this product making my skin much darker than it was before this lotion.  I thought with Snooki&#x27;s name being attached to this product it would work a little better than it did.  I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> Good color but made my skin dry and itchy and I am not a fair skin person.&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t purchase again</li>
    <li> Great product and it worked extremely fast. I did get a slight burnt smell when tanning but it smelt great when putting it on!</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion really does get you dark and works well but it has the worst after tan smell I have ever smelled. It is not worth suffering the smell at all, there are lotions that are just as good or better and smell much better. My favorite Jersey Shore lotion so far is Pauly D&#x27;s Bronze Beats. It has a very light smell and smells the same after you tan. I like JWWOW&#x27;s also but the bottle is super hard and I have to use both hands just to get the lotion out. I would not recommend this to anyone, the smell is sickening.</li>
    <li> I ordered this a few day ago and I received it today in perfect condition. It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted. I saw the same lotion in the salons and I was trying to find it cheaper, and I did! Shipped with priority mail. I couldn&#x27;t ask for more. Thank you it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> This lotion applies like silk on skin. The bronzing starts when you lay under the tanning lights. Non stainging, has an amazing smell. Well worth the purchase price.</li>
    <li> Love this bronzer.&lt;br /&gt;If you like bronzers this is a good lotion.&lt;br /&gt;I have not found a lotion that doesn&#x27;t smell like you just tanned yet and I&#x27;ve been tanning for years.&lt;br /&gt;This is very affordable compared to overpriced salons.</li>
    <li> I tried this lotion when it first came out when I worked in a tanning salon. I loved the smell and I saw a slight difference the first time after tanning but it leaves your skin SO STICKY!!</li>
    <li> This product gives great color!</li>
    <li> Worked great! Ladies at the salon loved the smell. The tinting is just enough to give you a great glow. Surprisingly happy</li>
    <li> Your product is normally $80 off the shelf! So greatful for you and your lotions! As long as i tan ill keep buyin. :)</li>
    <li> love this lotion! I can definitely tell a difference in my color and I am already dark, the only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is the greasy feeling after tanning. I make myself wait several hours before I will shower to let it soak in, but I have shared it with several people who all have loved it!!!!</li>
    <li> this is my new fave lotion! It smells great and it has the perfect amount of bronzer. This lotion is so much better than jwoww... Idk why more salons don&#x27;t carry it. Its the best!</li>
    <li> This is the best bronzer i have ever tried. It actually gave me results for once. I really saw results after the second use! And after the 3 i was several shades darker! This is great for getting dark fast! And it smells amazing, like strawberry smoothie.</li>
    <li> My new Snooki Black Bronzer is just what I expected.  A great tanning lotion with an awesome bronzer.  I received the lotion really quick and I am very pleased with this product and how quickly I received it.  Great price too!</li>
    <li> I absoutely love this product. It was very expensive at the salon and I was so glad to find it cheaper on amazon.com. It is very easy to apply to the skin and goes on very smooth. It doesnt leave your skin orange like some tanning lotions do. I am a very active tanner and this is one of the best tanning lotions I have come across.</li>
    <li> This is a great lotion! Got it early and it smells amazing! Irma&#x27;s me 3 shades darker by the first use</li>
    <li> This lotion made my skin breakout and very dry and red. I do believe it was fake, I have bought the same thing from my salon and never had a problem, I should have knew it because the price was so great on here! Tried to contact seller and never returned any of my emails! The Jems on the top of bottle fell off as soon as I touched the bottle. It was watery also. Dont waste ur time or money on this product!!</li>
    <li> I am a very very fair person and I tried a lot of different lotions from tingles to accelerators and this worked the best and the fastest! I love this product and I recommend giving this a try. I could tell a HUGE difference the first time I used this in the tanning bed! And I&#x27;m big on how a tanning lotion smells too and this smells great! It&#x27;s very tropical and fruity scented.</li>
    <li> Smells awesome! i.e. bubbalicious gum, mixed with summer time... pure bliss!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That aside, the main purpose is for this to work... and that it does! My tan was dark and long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Left skin very moisturized!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only con: do not leave this in your car on a hot day... the crystals on the top all melted off!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this tanning lotion. Many have distinct tanning-salon smells and everyone in a mile-radius can tell you&#x27;ve been fake-baking, but this one smells great and is surprisingly still subtle (something Snooki is not known for :P). The amount of bronzer is perfect even with my fair skin tone; I wasn&#x27;t so sure when I saw the color of the lotion. The only disappointment was the rhinestones on the cap kept falling off all over into my purse and car!</li>
    <li> I knew that if Snooki was going to endorse on a great product, it would be to do with tanning. I tried a sample of this lotion at my local salon after trying many samples and not finding the one for me. This lotion is easy to apply, not too sticky, has a great fresh smell to it, and just works so well on my body. The next day I ordered the lotion, and can&#x27;t see myself using another tanning product for a while!</li>
    <li> This lotion worked great for me. I usually hate how tanning lotions smell after you get out of the tanning bed, but I just thought that was the price to pay for indoor tanning until I found this product. I was skeptical because of the Snooki thing, but I&#x27;m glad I took a chance on it. Now I don&#x27;t feel like I immediately want to go take a shower because of how bad my lotion smells after tanning!</li>
    <li> It leaves my skin so soft and leaves a kiss of strawberries! Love the smell and love the way it leaves my skin super soft. The color it gives to is great. Props Snooks</li>
    <li> This same lotion is at my tanning salon for 63.00 dollars! I just use it today and I will buy again! Love it and it will works and smells so good I&#x27;m very happy with it!!!!</li>
    <li> If you go into any retail chain or even the tanning salon they want to charge you $50+ for this bottle. For free shipping + great price you can not beat this. The tanning lotion itself works wonders. In just a few sessions I was nice a bronze. This is a rather oily lotion but for me I do not mind. For others they may. It smells great too!!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. I work in a tanning salon so I was skeptical about buying lotion online. This lotion is just like the real stuff in the salon at fraction of the price!</li>
    <li> perfect tan every time!</li>
    <li> I LOOOOOVE the way this product smells....it&#x27;s almost like wearing perfume because it stays with you and I always get compliments wearing it. It works great and seems to help my skin from drying out after tanning a lot. Love the bottle too, it&#x27;s cute!</li>
    <li> I wish I could give this product zero stars. I love snooki tanning lotions and believe me when I say THIS IS NOT A REAL SNOOKI LOTION. I used smoke before and wanted to mix things up so I got this one. After tanning only once, I was burning and itching all over. The pain was unbearable. I could not fall asleep even after I applied aloe. I took a shower the next day and scrubbed my skin. After two days tanning with smoke again, there was no itchiness or burning. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY AND CAUSES UNBEARABLE PAIN.</li>
    <li> I love Snooki&#x27;s tanning lotion line..I had the blue bottle before this one and loved that one too..this one smells like heaven!! I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 bc I don&#x27;t think the tan lasts very long but it definitely works..also I think I got it within 2 to 3 days so I&#x27;m pretty happy with it..I always get my lotions from the Tann Man and have never been disappointed in the product or the amount of time it took to be delivered so I won&#x27;t test my luck with anyone else</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been sunless tanning for a few years now, and have tried many lotions varying from Wal-Mart brands to the ones sold in tanning salons. I tried Snooki Ultra Black Bronzer and was amazed! I tan easily as well, but after tanning four times within a week, i could tell a huge difference, and so did my friends. It smells amazing, and the bottle is cute :]. DEFINITELY make sure you buy this online though... it&#x27;s much more expensive in a tanning salon (the one I purchased it at, about $50 more). If you want results, this is definitely the way to go.</li>
    <li> Smells great, works great, love, love this lotion. Not greasy, definitly tans you up without leaving any residue or orange tones. Just ordered my 3rd bottle.</li>
    <li> I bought a little sample of this lotion about the second time I started getting in the tanning bed for the summer. The sample lasted me for 2 sessions. I was really impressed with the lotion. I&#x27;m white/Mexican but I&#x27;m really pale, which is why I get in the tanner. I don&#x27;t tan easy so I decided to give Snooki a try. My boyfriend could tell a difference after one session. It wasn&#x27;t a orange color like I was afraid of. Instead, it was a nice dark tan look. I was very pleased with the texture and the smell, which my boyfriend also liked. I did not notice any streaking or any color washing off in the shower. I&#x27;ve been using the Phoenician and although its good, it wasn&#x27;t giving me the dark color I wanted at the speed I want. I would recommend this to anybody that can use bronzers.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this as it is endorsed by Snooki. Yet, I figure if she knows about anything it probably tanning. I am glad I tried it. I love it and have gotten many compliments on my tan and I have only gone 5 times. I have gotten a pretty and natural color from this. The color is so nice that my grandma, aunt and cousins have all gotten this lotion.</li>
    <li> This lotion is awesome! It smells good and rubs in great. It has alot of bronzers in it but doesnt make u orange or streaky. I love this lotion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been tanning once and used this lotion once since i got it so i haven&#x27;t been able to see if it&#x27;s made me more tan or not, but it definitely smells amazing (:&lt;br /&gt;This lotion smells the best out of any lotion I&#x27;ve  used before. It didn&#x27;t irritate my skin or anything; I used it on my face and i was fine. But it did leave the orangeness around my hands and fingers like any other high bronzer does, kind of like a spray tan. Very cheaply priced compared to tanning salons price for it. Over all i like it, hope it really makes me tan!</li>
    <li> I am a very fair skinned woman, and I had not tanned in over a year and a half. I researched tanning lotions and surprisingly, this lotion got good ratings. Let me tell ya....people are not lying when they say that this lotion smells GREAT!!!! It smells like a nice fragrance lotion you would buy from Bath &amp; Body Works....and the great smell lasts at least an hour or two after tanning! Like I said, I had not tanned in over a year and a half, and after the first lay, of only 8min, I could already tell a slight difference! The tanning lotion did not turn me orange, or leave stains on my hands. I am very pleased with this purchase....I may not like Jersey Shore, but Snooki obviously knows a thing or two about tanning ;)</li>
    <li> First off, it got to my house super fast. Second, I saw results after using it just once! It makes me have a natural-looking tan and it doesn&#x27;t make me look orange. It gives me a nice sexy beach tan. My friends always wonder if I just got back from the beach lol I DEFINITELY recommend it to all tanners! Male or female! Love it!!!!</li>
    <li> I received the tanning lotion went tanning next day and right away looked tan. It smells great and is not greasy at all. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product about a month ago and when I received it, it was wrapped and sealed. It give me great tanning results, so I can&#x27;t complain there, but my tanning salon owner and I are questioning if its really snooki lotion inside. According to several people who have used this same product it&#x27;s not. They all tell me that the scent of my lotion is different then the real stuff. Btw this stuff smells great! Like candy! So I probably won&#x27;t order it again cause I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;m putting on my skin, but I intend to finish the bottle.</li>
    <li> Works great and love the smell</li>
    <li> Omg this is by far the best bronzer I&#x27;ve ever used. I have used hot, cold and tingle bronzes before and none have given me the results like this Snooki black bronzer. It got me a deep dark bronzed tan so fast that I didn&#x27;t need to tan as often and saved money. The tanning salons mark their lotions up 100%, I found this one for sale at over $42...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Must try!! And the smell is so yummy! It&#x27;s light but delicious! A overall much better product than the JWoww bronzer (I hate to say but that one smells bad!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To dark tan cheeks ;)</li>
    <li> I was looking for something that would get me tan because the lotion I had was awful. After reading reviews about tanning lotions I was down to this and the Jwoww lotion and I decided to go with the Snooki because of the overall ratings. I was super impressed! I saw results after my second tan and it smells amazing and leaves your skin feeling super soft! I would recommend this to any one who wants a good smelling lotion that leaves there skin soft with a natural looking tan.</li>
    <li> I work at a tanning salon and I have sampled a ton of different lotions but I loved this one so much that I bought the bottle! it is a little bit greasy but I have never gotten such great color! it also smells really good.  I will definitely buy this lotion again!</li>
    <li> This was bought for a present for a teenager.  She was so excited to get it.  Haven&#x27;t heard anything negative back on it...I guess she still loves it.</li>
    <li> I could tell the difference within two times tanning!! I would buy this again and even try other brands. Love love</li>
    <li> Got my lotion super fast! I have a bottle from the tanning bed that I compared it to, and they are identical. Smells sooo good! This product he&#x27;s you super dark! And fast! Be careful though, I have olive skin and this burned me the first few uses! All in all, I would order from this company again!!</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping, and product is exactly as described. I got the snooki ultra dark bronzer. Haven&#x27;t seen a huge change when I use it in the tanning bed, but it&#x27;s a good lotion</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this tanning lotion for years an my skin got dark. This lotion or any tanning lotion will tan your fake nails, read up on. What coat u need to prevent that.. I love this so I hope you do as well..&lt;br /&gt;Have not bought from this seller yet.</li>
    <li> This is a great lotion! It gets you dark quickly and it even works outside in the sun!</li>
    <li> This is a product I will buy again it works great, gave me a deep bronzed Snooki Tan that rocked my world and the scent...ahhh .. It&#x27;s eatible oh and it came quicker than expected I am completely happy... Try this you&#x27;ll feel beautifully bronzed baby! :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been tanning in a salon for some time. I recently had to stop and wait for my baby to be born to start up again. I wanted to try this because well c&#x27;mon it&#x27;s by Snooki. Well after the first use I saw very little change. I&#x27;ve never experienced streaks with any tanning lotion but this one left streaks. I&#x27;ve used it a few times since and everytime I take extra time to make sure I rub it in really well and I always have streaks. I&#x27;ll probably be buying an different brand.</li>
    <li> inexpensive, no streaking, amazing smell, VERY pleased with this lotion! All of my fellow-tanners will be getting Snooki for christmas gifts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pale/medium skin&lt;br /&gt;beginner tanning&lt;br /&gt;level 2/level 3 beds</li>
    <li> Be careful!  This product made me have a severe reaction to it.  I am a frequent tanner and love trying new lotions.  I have never had a bad experience with a lotion until now.  This made my skin itch and burn so bad that I developed a rash with whelps.  Maybe I didn&#x27;t get the true product, maybe it had been tampered with but either way save your self the pain and cost of a doctor&#x27;s visit!</li>
    <li> It works great, smells great. I&#x27;ve tried quite a few lotions and I don&#x27;t know about you but there is always a strange but light smell when I get out of a tanning bed, this lotion doesn&#x27;t have that either that or covers it up. You cannot beat the prices on Amazon vs the tanning salons.</li>
    <li> This is not the best tanning lotion I have bought, but it&#x27;s ok. I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, just because I&#x27;m not as dark as I like to be with this lotion. However it smells good and was a good price.</li>
    <li> This smells great and still smells good after you get out of the tanning bed! Snooki products are great in my opinion. gives you a nice golden tan , no streakiness and the smell is VERY important to me. Almost out, will DEFINITELY be ordering again.</li>
    <li> I have only used this product once but i can see a HUGE difference because i have fair skin and the only way i tan is with a bronzing lotion. I love snooki i probably will stick with this lotion from now on and i have used probably 30 to 40 different bronzers</li>
    <li> The smell isn&#x27;t bad when you put it on, however if you wait to long to wash it off it starts to not smell good, I have to wash it off as soon as I can, but when I do my tan goes away! I use a lot of lotions and have been tanning for years I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this lotion again, it wasn&#x27;t worth the money to me!</li>
    <li> I have been through hundreds of bottles of tanning lotion and I KNOW what a tingler feels like and this has a tingling ingrediant of some sort in it. This is VERY misleading as this bottle nor the decription of this product says anything about a tingler. I have very sensitive skin and cannot use tingling lotions. I almost screamed once I got into the bed after I applied this to my face. My cheeks and chin were on fire for days. NO I DID NOT PURCHASE THE PINK BOTTLE. I think I know what Black and Pink look like.&lt;br /&gt;I will NEVER buy from this company again, I suggest you do the same.</li>
    <li> i havent actually tried Snooki tanning lotion but i keep reading great reviews for this lotion and the purple 70x firming and toning one. i was wondering if someone can help me and tell me which is better or what the difference is.???&lt;br /&gt;i have a nice tan going and was just looking to upgrade to a better lotion with a bronzer. i also tend to alternate from indoor and outdoor tanning.&lt;br /&gt;thank you!</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved this bronzer! I went on a trip to Mexico and for one, I&#x27;m from the midwest so I am pretty pale and I also didn&#x27;t want to burn while on my trip. I almost bought this in the tanning salon store but glad I didn&#x27;t because they were selling it for $80! This stuff works great! It gives you a great glow and it doesn&#x27;t smell. The only thing is you are slimy when you first get in the shower but obviously that washes away. I normally burn within an hour of being out in the sun, even with sun screen lotion on! I didn&#x27;t burn at all while in Mexico, it worked fabulous! I had so many people comment on how nice I looked with a tan and now I wish I could be that tan all year long! I will definitely be using this again before summer officially hits and again in the fall for my wedding.</li>
    <li> Loved the product and the price. Works in tanning bed, outdoors or a self tanner. Does not turn orange.</li>
    <li> Great product for a great price.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. It smells great, like candy. It goes on we&#x27;ll too. It gives a dark instant bronze color. I love how it doesn&#x27;t tingle. Fast delivery too.</li>
    <li> This products gets you brown no doubt! However, I am getting these weird cystic breakouts on my back, belly, and legs since using this product. Maybe I didn&#x27;t get the real thing unfortunately... Also, everyone talks about the amazing smell but this smells flat and just like another tanning lotion I ordered from Supre not long ago..</li>
    <li> LOVE this tanning lotion, and Amazon was much cheaper than my tanning salon.</li>
    <li> Love this tanning lotion! Very easy to Work with and not a tingling lotion</li>
    <li> Love the product great results</li>
    <li> I love the Snooki Black Bronzer lotion! The smell isn&#x27;t bad and you can really see the difference in just after a tan or two! Not to mention the bottle is beautiful! The only con I was say about it is that the bottle is really hard so it&#x27;s not extremely easy to squeeze the lotion out after you use a lot of it. Just shake it a bit and it&#x27;ll come right out. Other than that, I love it!</li>
    <li> I tried this lotion and I absolutely fell in love with it, I has a very nice smell so when i get out of the tanning bed I smell good and my skin is super soft.</li>
    <li> it showed up just fine enjoy the product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used indoor tanning lotion before and I got a tanning bed membership a few weeks ago and decided I needed some. So I bought Snooki&#x27;s bronzing lotion, I figured since Snooki is famous for her fake tan that it would work pretty well. But I cannot tell much of a difference from when I wasn&#x27;t using it. On the plus side, it smells really good and even hours after you tan your body doesn&#x27;t smell like tanning bed! But if you&#x27;re looking for really good lotion for the tanning bed I wouldn&#x27;t choose this.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this tanning lotion she uses it all the time.  No streaking and smells goos too.  This is her second bottle</li>
    <li> Love this lotion. Smell is great and I noticed a darker tan on the first time. Leaves skin soft. Would recommend. Thanks</li>
    <li> i love how it smells and how dark it gets me.. my fave tanning lotion by far!  i also bought one for my friend and she also loves it!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this lotion! It was shipped really quick. Is As described.. I&#x27;ve only tanned twice and can already see a good difference..</li>
    <li> If you like the guido/guidette (it&#x27;s marketed like that, by the way) dark tan look, you&#x27;re going to love this lotion. If you want orange, obviously fake tan (which some people do), use it every time you tan. If you want a more natural but nonetheless dark, use it every other time. Using it every time will give you that orange guido look so beware, unless that&#x27;s what you want of course!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;Smells amazing even after you tan&lt;br /&gt;A lot cheaper than most tanning salons&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is so cute, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Like any tanning lotion, your hands usually become orange and will still smell no matter how many times you wash them&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s overall a great lotion if you know how to use it correctly. Get your tan (or mesothelioma) on!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best tanning bronzer lotion I&#x27;ve used to date. It smells amazing like strawberry cupcakes. I get compliments on how great I smell even by the tanning salon workers who said they could smell me all the way from the tanning bed. When I go to work my coworkers also compliment me on how great I smell along with my classmates in college. It also moisturizes your skin leaving your skin silky smooth. This lotion not only smells amazing but works wonders. I got compliments on how dark I was getting in such a short time and was also always complimented on what an amazing skin color I had from this lotion. I would recommend this lotion to anyone and everyone. You&#x27;ll look amazing while smelling amazing!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this lotion. The tan it helps we achieve it great. It arrived in 2 days. Would definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> I like this but dont love it.I mix this withScandalous by Swedish Beauty and by combineing the two it gives great color.Snooki black bronzer I will say is not bad with the priceing and scandalous is kinda pricey,so by mixing the two you save on not useing up all of the pricey one.I also get real good color by doing this.My skin is all silky smooth afetr tanning where as Snooki on its own I dont get that result. The consistency of Snooki black bronzer is the same as a outdoor tanning lotion.It has a nice clean fresh scent to it. I would purchase again but only to mix in with the scandalous as I love that! Its a shame ya cant get those results from just one product.I have tried several and trust me this mixing does the trick.My tan looks like I have been outside.</li>
    <li> Great tanning product</li>
    <li> i absolutly love this lotion. i get so many compliments on how great my tan looks an the lotion smells so good.</li>
    <li> This is good if u like bronzers. U tan right away. I thought I liked bronzers til I realized that 95% of the bronzer WASHES OFF! So now I use a tingle lotion! *Fingers crossed*</li>
    <li> If you used snooki like me just got done w/one so opened this (odd had big piece clear tape over top of it) and NO this is not SNOOKI, I demand refund or reporting this, do NOT order here people serious I Warned you if you did and get what I did.&lt;br /&gt;This place should be banned, SCAM. Karma will get them.&lt;br /&gt;The Real Snooki is the Best! Order elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I loved this product! It smells great and works very well as a bronzer.  I have sensitive skin and did not have a reaction (although, I did not put it on my face).  Overall, I really like this tanning lotion!</li>
    <li> I think this was a good purchase. At the tanning places it is like $50-60 and I got it for alot cheaper which is perfect!  The shipping was fast! Got it before the deliever date and it was in perfect condition when I got it.  I used it twice already and love the smell, also love it doesn&#x27;t stain my hands.  SO far I think it is doing a good job and is darkening me ever time I go!</li>
    <li> SO GLAD I DID NOT PAY $60 FOR THIS LOTION!! Yes it got me dark but I rarely burn when I go tanning and have used other lotions before but after the first use I was red then waited a few days to go again and used a different lotion and I was fine, not red. The next time I went I tried Snooki&#x27;s ultra dark black brozner tanning lotion and when I got out I had red bumps, almost like hives or chicken pox all over my chest and stomach!! When I first got out of the bed they weren&#x27;t bad but as the hours past it got worst and worst and was tingling</li>
    <li> This product after one use left me orange and spotted.  I look like an Oompa Loompa.  Do not recommend buying this.</li>
    <li> product arrived without being sealed , the smell was ok , but NO-where did it say this was a &amp;#34;HOT&amp;#34; lotion in the description or on the bottle. this product burned like hot lava when I put it on my face and neck . I didn&#x27;t see a color change except for the rash I had after use . my tanning salon girl said let me try it , she did and said it did not match the quality to the bottles they had on their shelfs. used the lotion only 3 times and then threw it away , not worth the money spent on it , wouldn&#x27;t recommend !</li>
    <li> I got the nicest tan from this product!&lt;br /&gt;I am very fair skined and it takes me forever to tan but I used this product and it produced a nice sun kissed tan.  I &#x27;m very happy with my new summer skin:) another perk is the smell; fruity, very nice.</li>
