      <li>As soon as she saw it she fell in love.  </li>
      <li>I got the ivory color and absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>but I think I have more make-up than I thought.</li>
      <li>love this, wish I had gotten one sooner.</li>
      <li>and I love the watch</li>
      <li>So adorably cute.</li>
      <li>Also, the clock did not work, BUT the company was very easy to contact and they sent a working replacement very quickly.</li>

      <li>Smaller than you might think, and most of the holes were not the right size to use with most of my products.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t take up to much space on my vanity!!</li>
      <li>Very cheap looking in person and the holes for makeup barely fit any standard size lipsticks etc..</li>
      <li>Great little organizer.</li>
      <li>and it definitely comes in handy.</li>
      <li>Looks great, not sure if worth 28 bucks</li>
      <li>Exactly like the picture.</li>
      <li>Recommended to any woman who wants organization to their makeup!</li>
      <li>She said it was exactly what she wanted.</li>
      <li>It is exactly what she needed.</li>
      <li>:) I need something bigger.</li>
      <li>and I dont loose things as easily!</li>
      <li>I would certainly recommend it to anyone interested.</li>
      <li>Another great thing is that some of the round spots on the face of this piece are slightly more shallow than others, so some of my smaller bottles fit nicely without sinking in too deep!</li>
      <li>I got this for my daughter and she really loves it.</li>
      <li>i expected something better quality</li>
      <li>thanks a lot</li>
      <li>That could be used for more lipstick storage and other items.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not as aesthetically pleasing as I&#x27;d hoped, but it&#x27;s better than the mess I had without it.</li>
      <li>This has helped me get a little more organized......</li>
      <li>I wanted something that looked a little better than the clear plastic holders but didn&#x27;t want to spend too much.</li>
      <li>everything fits to where i can see them and take them easily without them all coming down like dominoes!</li>
      <li>but it has some real potential adn will organize the things I need organized a little better in our bathroom.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;it takes too much space and not very functional.</li>
      <li>This is exactly what I was looking for but seems a little pricey for what it is.</li>
      <li>wasn&#x27;t my first choice, but the number one was not available</li>
      <li>My favorite thing about this is how little room it takes in my small bathroom countertop.</li>

<li> Provides a little organization to the vanity table but clock didn&#x27;t work.</li>
<li> The clock part is a waste of space though.</li>
<li> Bought this as a gift for my wife who was complaining of having a messy vanity area.  </li>
<li> I has been a few weeks now</li>
<li> the clock is a waste of space it never ran from the day I got it.  </li>
<li> A little small</li>
<li> To small and everything falls out when you move it .</li>
<li> It drives me crazy because everything is different diameters and lengths</li>
<li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this.</li>
<li> I would be afraid to mount it on the wall to store anything of weight.</li>
<li> I was disappointed that it&#x27;s plastic.</li>

    <li> This is a very useful item that has helped me organize the clutter of my bathroom. Now instead of digging in a drawer or bag for makeup items, it&#x27;s all at my fingertips and easy to find. I am using the two pieces separately, which increases the area for storing larger standup items like hair products and deodorant. I was disappointed that it&#x27;s plastic. It looks like a sturdier composite in the picture. I would be afraid to mount it on the wall to store anything of weight. It&#x27;s not as aesthetically pleasing as I&#x27;d hoped, but it&#x27;s better than the mess I had without it. Also, the clock did not work, BUT the company was very easy to contact and they sent a working replacement very quickly.</li>

    <li> Love it!! All my stuff now is on the same place and I love the watch</li>
    <li> Exactly like the picture.</li>

    <li> Very cheap looking in person and the holes for makeup barely fit any standard size lipsticks etc.. half of them will probably remain empty.</li>
    <li> Works as intended, a great space saver. Wish it wasn&#x27;t plastic though. But I can&#x27;t find anything like this out there so beggars can&#x27;t be choosers.</li>
    <li> My daughter LOVES it.  It is exactly what she needed.</li>
    <li> on the top shelf my foundation and moisturizers tend to drop, but besides that very useful!</li>
    <li> Perfect! I have a TON of makeup I use on a daily basis. It drives me crazy because everything is different diameters and lengths so I&#x27;ve never found a single organiser that can hold all of my things until now. Another great thing is that some of the round spots on the face of this piece are slightly more shallow than others, so some of my smaller bottles fit nicely without sinking in too deep!

I&#x27;ve had friends say they couldn&#x27;t afford something so nice, and they&#x27;ve all been shocked at the price vs.quality. Will be using this for some time!</li>

    <li> I gave it as a Christmas present my granddaughter had on her wish list. When she opened it she stated it was just what she wanted. She was very pleased and filled it with her &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; the next day. I has been a few weeks now and she is still very happy with it.</li>
    <li> My favorite cosmetic organizer of ALL TIME! :o)</li>
    <li> So adorably cute. Reminds me of a princess for some reason like a castle. Keeps my things easy to grab for and all together and neat.</li>
    <li> A little small but it will make a great gift</li>
    <li> To small and everything falls out when you move it .</li>

    <li> I gave this to my 18-year-old granddaughter for Christmas, and she was absolutely thrilled!  She immediately started to put all her makeup, brushes, etc. into it.  Also, she loves having the clock to help keep her on time.  She said it was exactly what she wanted.</li>

    <li> It&#x27;s a plastic organizer that isn&#x27;t super expensive.  Don&#x27;t expect everything from it but it has some real potential adn will organize the things I need organized a little better in our bathroom.  The clock part is a waste of space though.</li>
    <li> this organizer is great. I can fit all of my brushes and lipstick/liners and lotions in it. Just wish there was some where to put all of my eyeshadows. It&#x27;s so cute though and you can fit quite a bit in there. I would definitely recommend it. My counter is finally organized.</li>
    <li> The most awesome make -up organizer ever !!!!</li>
