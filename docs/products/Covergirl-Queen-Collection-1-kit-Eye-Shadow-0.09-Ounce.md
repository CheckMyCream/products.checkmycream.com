<li> and I think itll go with my swamp green hazel eyes.</li>
<li> It is olive green.</li>
<li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <li> Love Covergirl products. They have a great variety of eye shadow colors. I like the bronze look and this color was perfect for me. You may have to reapply throughout the day if you do not apply a product that helps keep eye shadow on longer.</li>
    <li> Color is way off from pic. It appears to be olive green. I&#x27;m happy with It but remember it&#x27;s not the color shown so you will be very disappointed if your wanting this pretty golden color. It is olive green. I will update after trying it out. I got it for .99 cause a 1.00 off web coupon.I don&#x27;t mind if it doesn&#x27;t work out cause I mainly got it as an add-on. The color I received appears very pretty and I think itll go with my swamp green hazel eyes.</li>
    <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know that I will ever wear it. It&#x27;s much more like Army green...but I guess that is what you get for a buck.</li>
    <li> Great product , great price !!  Love it.</li>

    <li> When it&#x27;s sent to my apt, it&#x27;s broken from inside. I was intended to return but I was busy in something else</li>
    <li> Color received is not the same as what is pictured. Looks brown in photo. What I received was actually about thde color of sage.  I thought Iwas ordering one eye shadow but received 3 of same item. Great price for what I got...... just wish color was as pictured.</li>
    <li> I love this color. I an Italian-American olive skin toned woman with dark hair and eyes. This color looks great with my features. It gives you that natural look with just a little bit of shimmer to bring out your eyes.</li>
    <li> I was very happy to find this on Amazon, this is a very high quality product last all day.</li>
