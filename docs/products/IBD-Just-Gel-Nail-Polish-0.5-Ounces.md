      <li>it&#x27;s more like a purple magenta.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s darker than the picture, but very bright purple-y pink.</li>
      <li>The application of the IBD is flawless (if your a professional nail technician), it&#x27;s smooth and easy to clean with a French brush.</li>

      <li>but i&#x27;m still looking for my hot pink.</li>
      <li>color in the picture looks like a hot pink, i decided to give this color a chance since Parasol was out of stock.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a pink</li>
      <li>and i couldn&#x27;t tell while indoors but once outside in the sun the color shimmers with little blue flakes (probably why color looks a bit purple-like); still a pretty color,</li>
      <li>This color is much darker and a little purpley to me.</li>

    <li> Although it&#x27;s a pretty color. It&#x27;s not a pink it&#x27;s more like a purple magenta.</li>
    <li> Before IDB Gel Polish I used to use the brand Gelish. I love both product but IBD offers more BRIGHT colors and the polish is not as thick as Gelish. The application of the IBD is flawless (if your a professional nail technician), it&#x27;s smooth and easy to clean with a French brush. This color is AMAZING. Over all I love IBD products.</li>

    <li> is not how i expected. color in the picture looks like a hot pink, i decided to give this color a chance since Parasol was out of stock. This color is much darker and a little purpley to me. more like a magenta. but i tried it anyway and have received compliments. it is a very bright magenta and i couldn&#x27;t tell while indoors but once outside in the sun the color shimmers with little blue flakes (probably why color looks a bit purple-like); still a pretty color, but i&#x27;m still looking for my hot pink.</li>
    <li> Great color,on time,i&#x60;m happy :) In future Ill buy again more from this seller :)</li>
    <li> I have purchased this color before &amp; this time it is much thinner. I had to use 3 coats.</li>

    <li> My absolute favorite Happy Color! Lasts FOREVER!</li>
    <li> Shipping time satisfactory. Product good.</li>
    <li> THIS COLOR IS A HOT PINK AND IS REALLY FUN. IT IS MORE OF A HOT PINK THAN IS SHOWN ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE BOTTLE. I LOVE IT</li>
    <li> This is a great summer color. It definitely fuchsia...almost neon. It&#x27;s darker than the picture, but very bright purple-y pink. I recommend buying from Beauty Shine. Superb seller!!</li>
    <li> This brand is awesome. Use this brand every time I go to shop. This is my go to color. I had a question on polish, supplier contacted me right away with a response and the were very nice and helpful.</li>
    <li> This is such a bold and happy color and someone compliments me at least once a day about my beautiful nails.  I purchased several bottles as stocking stuffers and my girlfriends were ecstatic.</li>
