      <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>And the conditioner top got clogged (i think) or</li>
      <li>If anything it made my hair feel more brittle.  </li>
      <li>I had to take the top off to use.</li>
      <li>More than I thought I would ever see again.  </li>
      <li>Some people need to use more Minoxidil, some people need a stronger Kena shampoo than Revita (like Nizoral).  </li>
      <li>They all love it.</li>
      <li>As with most women, I was devestated with the diagnosis.  </li>
      <li>and I do believe it is healthy and getting thicker</li>
      <li>Love, love, love this product.</li>
      <li>After three months of using the product and not at all like the directions said to, I notice he had hair growing in on top of his head.  </li>
      <li>Most shampoos were wrecking my hair and I was either losing lots of hair during brushing or my hair would still feel greasy.</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>I love the shampoo</li>
      <li>I fell in love with it.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m hopeful with continued use that it will help prevent more loss.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t see any difference in my hair, in fact I seem to be losing more since I have been using it.</li>
      <li>will continue to by this product because its better then any hair care I can pick up at the store.</li>
      <li>I was in fact loosing more strands of hair than before.</li>
      <li>I have used this combo for about four months and have enjoyed the benefits of smoother more manageable hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Revita Hair Growth shampoo for about 8 weeks now, and I love it.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for four weeks now and can&#x27;t being to explain how much better my hair looks.</li>
      <li>He had lost all the hair on top of his head and it was smooth and shiney.</li>
      <li>Makes your hair soft as silk and is a great product.  </li>
      <li>I would strongly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I have found that shaving my head then using the product with the DNC treatment allows for full absorption and better performance.</li>
      <li>I have been using it for close to half a year, and it leave my hair feeling and looking the best though.</li>
      <li>Fortunately I was able to return it for a full refund, but resent the misrepresentation and time and energy required to return the product</li>
      <li>The conditioner bottle is fine but the shampoo will leak out if it is not vertical</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s making me more bold</li>
      <li>This product is fabulous.  </li>
      <li>But it does have a great smell and has lasted quite a while when used properly.  </li>
      <li>I do enjoy this product as a shampoo and conditioner, whether or not it helps with hair regrowth.</li>
      <li>so far so good, I think it takes 6 weeks to see any difference</li>
      <li>It is possibly only good to use on healthy bodies to help thicken.  </li>
      <li>, I highly recommend it!!!!</li>
      <li>Well worth the money!</li>
      <li>you will start to shed hair a lot more for the first two and some times three weeks.</li>
      <li>I have noticed a lot of improvement in my own hair of what I have left and my scalp feels extremely healthy.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t clean my hair well at all.</li>
      <li>I have always had baby fine hair, but always enough to style and still make a good full style with the right</li>
      <li>When getting ready to travel, I made sure I put both containers in a plastic bag.  </li>
      <li>Also, the texture of the conditioner is as though it&#x27;s full of splinters.</li>
      <li>Overall, at this point, I am very pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s doing a great job slowing down the hair loss.</li>
      <li>I would give this seller and shop 5/5 stars, however, I have lost a significant amount of a fairly pricey shampoo due to leakage.  </li>
      <li>It is well worth it.  </li>
      <li>Its worth the $$.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Definitely worth a try.</li>
      <li>Product exactly as described, works well have been using for a year and a half and have seen great results in hair regrowth</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair feeling very soft, smooth and shiny.  </li>
      <li>You do not have to use very much.  </li>
      <li>Is that it makes me at least think that I am getting a good clean shampoo and conditioning..</li>
      <li>That being said, this product has still left me completely satisfied.</li>
      <li>used to use pert plus because I didn&#x27;t know any better, so this is a vast improvement.</li>
      <li>If he would use it daily as the recommendations are he might much more.  </li>
      <li>It never fails to leak</li>
      <li>and I didn&#x27;t have a problem with the first company.</li>
      <li>more importently I have hair growing back again.</li>
      <li>Use it for first time and waiting for results.</li>
      <li>We saw absolutely no difference although the shampoo itself is nice.  </li>
      <li>Do not miss a day for the first 6 months.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The product is good. The packaging is terrible. You can not travel with this bottle. It leaks. It never fails to leak</li>
    <li> It has not helped my thinning hair.  The amount of time and frequency was way to much for my thinning hair.</li>
    <li> Yuchi cheaper than from the hairdresser love it!!!</li>
    <li> I would give this seller and shop 5/5 stars, however, I have lost a significant amount of a fairly pricey shampoo due to leakage.  The shampoo leaked through upon arrival and the bottle has continued to leak throughout use.  The product works well and the seller shipped and product arrived on time.  I&#x27;m sure its just a product packaging issue, however, I hate to lose so much product with each use!</li>
    <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t regrow hair to my knowledge. I have been using it for close to half a year, and it leave my hair feeling and looking the best though. So as far as a shampoo and conditioner I am going to buy it again.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work and it stinks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Revita Hair Growth shampoo for about 8 weeks now, and I love it.  I had thinning hair and now have new hair growth and it appears thicker.  I highly recommend this shampoo to other women who are experiencing thinning hair.</li>
    <li> I have purchased two bottles of this shampoo and plan to see how they work after using both of them. I prefer using shampoos that lift and produce volume. After using one half of the first bottle, I can&#x27;t tell any difference yet, but it might be too soon. I might do another review after using them for an extended time.&lt;br /&gt;Price was good online with Amazon.com and I saved as compared to buying them locally.</li>
    <li> products made my hair very dry and brittle. Unfortunately, I was not able to return them. It&#x27;s hard enough when you start losing hair. This added to the problem. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> I have been using Revita Growth Stimulating Shampoo and conditioner now for about a month.  I have not had any problem with it (as reported by a few other reviewers).  It leaves my hair feeling very soft, smooth and shiny.  I have noticed that I don&#x27;t seem to have as much hair in my brushes and combs as before, so that is a plus.  As to whether it is stimulating new growth for the long term, it is too early to tell, but so far I am pleased with the everyday condition in which it leaves my hair.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t really tell if it&#x27;s working. Too soon to tell</li>
    <li> Like the product, and have positive results after 3 months of use. Bottle design (6 oz) flawed,  shampoo ok, but difficult to squeeze conditioner from the container. I had to take the top off to use.</li>
    <li> The last shipment was received with half filed bottles.</li>
    <li> I think it may have made a difference, I use it only on the \\&quot;hot spots\\&quot; that I believe my hair is thinning, but this product didn&#x27;t really make a difference.  I may need to put in a few more months of use to get an accurate experience on it.  UPDATE: 8/20/13 I have had this for awhile &amp; it really didn&#x27;t do much.  If anything it made my hair feel more brittle.  I don&#x27;t believe it helped &amp; really didn&#x27;t help growth.</li>
    <li> This Shampoo and Conditioner is of good quality and amount needed per wash in small so these item should last you for a while. I have used this combo for about four months and have enjoyed the benefits of smoother more manageable hair.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great. I&#x27;ve used others in the past before. Including nizoral, regenepure, pura d or. This one is by far the best. It didn&#x27;t entirely stop the hair fallout, but it&#x27;s only been a couple of days and I&#x27;ve noticed a difference. Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s working as intended or not, too soon to tell.  But it does have a great smell and has lasted quite a while when used properly.  Shipping was excellent.</li>
    <li> I use this in conjunction with the Spectral RS.  The shampoo and conditioner are very gentle on my hair and it doesn&#x27;t leave it limp or looking unwashed.  It has actually improved the texture of my hair.</li>
    <li> Shampoo is ok however, the conditioner feels like it has sharp tiny objects in it, kinda like broken glass. I only used the conditioner once, and in the trash it went.</li>
    <li> My husband and I have used many re-growth systems and find this is the best! I does take at least 2 months to see the progress. I&#x27;m on month 6 and my hair is so full and thick (not to mention longer). Love, love, love this product.</li>
    <li> I switched to this product from Nixon after hearing they switched their formula. I am sad to say, this product did not work for me. After I use this up, I will be going back.</li>
    <li> I use it everyday as per the instructions.  Do not miss a day for the first 6 months.  It absolutely works.</li>
    <li> I found this product through my local hair salon. The stylist used this to wash my hair when I went for a trim. I fell in love with it. The scent is amazing and the way that my hair feels after the use is awesome. It feels full and soft and it makes my head tingle while im using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to by this product because its better then any hair care I can pick up at the store. Its worth the $$.&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recomended!</li>
    <li> While I saw no decrease in hair loss, my main gripe is the quality of the containers for both the shampoo and the conditioner.  When getting ready to travel, I made sure I put both containers in a plastic bag.  I expected some of the shampoo to leak out of the container, but I did not expect what I found upon arrival at my destination.  The bag was completely smeared with shampoo that leaked out and it even went inside the lid of the conditioner container.  I had a problem while still at home with the shampoo leaking out of the closed container onto the medicine cabinet shelf.</li>
    <li> I purchased the shampoo and conditioner together and followed the instructions, however, I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my hair growth.  The shampoo bottle leaked constantly (even when sitting upright) and I lost a good amount of it down the drain because of the leakage.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> As far as a shampoo it&#x27;s great. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s helping my hair grow. I use this and rogaine and my hair is coming back. Smells great</li>
    <li> I read almost 100 reviews before buying this product in addition to to looking at all active ingredients and if their are any sulfate products. The ingredients listed were fine and reviews for the most part were good. So i decided to purchase it. Delivery was quick but the product was terrible. On first use my scalp became much drier and itchier than before, furthermore, by the end of the day my scalp was oily and looked like it needs to be washed. I did not like it. But I thought to give it some time. The more i used it the worse it got. I was in fact loosing more strands of hair than before. I gave up and went back to my old stuff. Not for everyone. If you plan on buying this buy a small bottle to try. I do not recommend this.</li>
    <li> I love the product but this distributor had poor packaging and the shampoo leaked. What a mess! This was my second order and I didn&#x27;t have a problem with the first company.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference in my hair, in fact I seem to be losing more since I have been using it. I am going to stop using it.  I am not satisfied at all.</li>
    <li> Product works quite well. It helps to strengthen and stimulate hair growth. The shampoo and conditioner is a good combo</li>
    <li> My hair washes well, practically odorless. I use it for a month, have less hair to fall out. I  washed twice a week  hair other shampoo. This shampoo is recommended to use every day. I my head every other day this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Took another set.&lt;br /&gt;I often go and take a set with you. Shampoo spilled a couple of times, although I close the lid. Unpleasant.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner. I&#x27;ve been using it for a while. I have noticed less &amp;#34;shed&amp;#34; in the shower as a result.</li>
    <li> As I&#x27;ve noted above, this product doesn&#x27;t really regrow your hair (or mine atleast) and needs to be used in conjunction with other products. It does seem to curb hair loss a little though. That being said, this product has still left me completely satisfied. Most shampoos were wrecking my hair and I was either losing lots of hair during brushing or my hair would still feel greasy. This shampoo finally solved both my problems. It softened my hair immensely and I&#x27;m no longer combing myself bald. I recently started using lipogaine and am waiting to see results there.&lt;br /&gt;Another huge plus is that given how long 6 ounzes of this lasts, its almost cheaper than regular shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;So in conclusion, this is a wonderful shampoo that leaves you feeling confident and clean for a very reasonable price and might even curb hair loss. If you want to see new hair growth however, it needs to used with other products.</li>
    <li> I was facing hair fall problems and I was suggested this shampoo and conditioner by my hair stylist.I must admit it did stop my hair fall to a great extent within one month of using the shampoo and conditioner.The only drawback is it made my scalp a bit too oily,may be that was because of using the shampoo 5 days a week so I had to switch to my other shampoo in between weeks just to get a drier scalp.The shampoo does what it says.If you are looking for something to get rid of hair fall problems one must go for it.</li>
    <li> The packaging is poor (the shampoo leaks), but in 6 weeks I have noticed that my hair falls a lot less. I use if every second day as directed (1-2 min massage with shampoo and 3-5 mins with conditioner). I would strongly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I LIKE THIS PRODUCT , BUT IT SAYS USE 5 TIMES A WEEK  PEOPLE WITH THINNING HAIR ARE USUALLY OLDER. IT IS NOT GOOD TO WASH HAIR 5 TIMES A WEEK .</li>
    <li> I have read tons of reviews of this shampoo and I want to preface that no one thing will help regrow hair.  I am having minor improvement so far, but this is with other things.  So for my review..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the shampoo for about a month now (this review will cover some on the conditioner, as I found it too heavy for my fine hair and had a bad, chemical like smell)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a female, 44 years old and have a front receding hairline and some diffuse thinning.  I am not completely bald, nor can you see my scalp through my hair on top except in the front.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dermatologist said I had AGA or something akin more to Male pattern baldness than female.  As with most women, I was devestated with the diagnosis.  I have always had baby fine hair, but always enough to style and still make a good full style with the right product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I found out what was going on I bought everything in sight without giving much thought to what I was buying.  I have calmed down somewhat and have found what seems to be working for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be clear, I am doing lots of things to help my hair situation and Revita is just one of them.  I only use the shampoo now, since I found the conditioner too heavy and it didn&#x27;t condition very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to my stylist yesterday and she said she can see new growth where I was almost completely without hair and very thin before. (the spots that I was thin)  I like the smell of the shampoo, and I use very little of it at a wash.  I also only use it 4-5 times a week, because I find it drying and rub it into the scalp more than all over my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use this in conjunction withe DS Labs Spectral DNC 5% minoxidil solution (once a day) Biotin, Vitamin E, Vitamin B-12, Vitamin C, Zinc and increased protein consumption.  I also another sulfate free shampoo and conditioner on my off days as well as argan oil to keep my hair soft and manageable.  I use Moroccan Oil shampoo and conditioner (just started).  But to get the results so far, I have just used Living Proof shampoo, a quality conditioner (usually redken though I am changing to morrocan oil because it seems to do better) on my off days from Revita.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found in my quest to protect my hair and to regrow what I can, nothing works for everyone.  Some people need to use more Minoxidil, some people need a stronger Kena shampoo than Revita (like Nizoral).  But so far, this is working for me.  If it stops being effective, I&#x27;ll try something else.</li>
    <li> Had high hopes for this product, but unfortunately, it does not regrow hair on my head.  I am even giving it a second chance by reordering, thinking I might need a longer time for the product to work.  No such luck.</li>
    <li> I really like the product itself and after about three really scary weeks of profuse shedding, my hair loss has not only stabilized but is much less than a normal person would expect.  The problem is that, for me, it is an expensive experiment and even more so when I receive containers that have leaked before I even get them.  I lost half of my conditioner due to leakage in the first shipment.  And when traveling, I saved the inner sealing plugs to prevent leaking but had a mess anyway.  How can I manage to keep enough product when its not even full when I receive it? I never know how long I can expect it to last! Glad to see I&#x27;m not the only one frustrated with the bottles.  And by the way, a travel size option would be nice.</li>
    <li> I have only used the product a few weeks, so I can&#x27;t really talk about the hair growth stimulation.  I can talk about the overall impact on my hair.  My hair appears cleaner and healthier than ever before.  My hair also appears thicker (the individual strands).  Overall, at this point, I am very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Product arrived deffective. Conditioner had not been stored by retailer properly, and had basically crystalized into this disgusting plasticy spikey material. I contacted the manufacturer only to be told this is the retailers fault... vicious circle of blame game begins. Furthermore, not to the fault of the the retailer, the bottle design is so terrible that nearly 1/4 of the total product leaks from the bottle in both the shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money here.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the product and the price!</li>
    <li> It came on time, I really love it! since I&#x27;m using this shampoo I&#x27;m not loosing that much hair it feels stronger, really recommend it</li>
    <li> Like the shampoo &amp; conditioner, not sure if it works as promised yet. However bottle leak all over the place. Won&#x27;t buy this product again. It made a mess.</li>
    <li> I(KIM Wathen) bought this as a Christmas present for my husband at the beauty shop.  He had lost all the hair on top of his head and it was smooth and shiney. After three months of using the product and not at all like the directions said to, I notice he had hair growing in on top of his head.  He had very little gray hair before and the new hair coming in is gray, but it is their.  It is now six months later and he has about an inch on top.  It is not real thick yet but their is still quite a bit of hair.  More than I thought I would ever see again.  In fact, I am ordering his 3rd bottle.  If he would use it daily as the recommendations are he might much more.  He spratically uses it.  You do not have to use very much.  It is well worth it.  Somewhere I have before and after pictures.  Proof it works.</li>
    <li> It used to be so wonderful. They changed manufacturing plant &amp;  formula. Watery substance, hair is falling out! Shame on you!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner. I was having problems with hair falling out by handfuls when I washed my hair. My hairdresser told me about it. I have recommended it to my family and a close friend. They all love it. It smells wonderful and I would recommend it to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GP</li>
    <li> The material I read about the product prior to purchase indicated that it was for both men and women. However, the literature with the product emphasized that it was for men - and women were a side bar. Fortunately I was able to return it for a full refund, but resent the misrepresentation and time and energy required to return the product</li>
    <li> I swear by this stuff. My hair line is somewhat receding in a particular area and with this product I can literally see the re-growth. Its pricey so I prefer the larger set but its hard for me to spend that big of a chunk of change $$$ still, as long as you use consistently I believe you will notice a difference as well.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say whether this product actually stimulates hair growth, but I can say it leaves my hair and scalp feeling very clean. I use the shampoo and conditioner, on an everyday basis.  My hair appears to be less oily throughout the day, as compared to other products. I can&#x27;t give five stars because I don&#x27;t think I gave used it long enough to tell if I&#x27;m getting better growth or not.</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t see any changes while using this shampoo and conditioner system.</li>
    <li> Great product and excellent delivery</li>
    <li> I have used Nixion and Moroccan oil.  But this product is great.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my scalp dry and the conditioner has left my hair soft after I have used it.  As for health growth I have not seen any difference, but again it has only been two weeks.  But the smell and the fell of it tingling against my scalp is great.</li>
    <li> I think this product is the best in the market. I have tried Nioxin and other topical treatments and shampoo/conditioners. DS Laboratories has by far beat the competition with quality and performance. My hair looks thicker and has slowed down the process of thinning. Please note! When you first start Revita and Revita Cor you will start to shed hair a lot more for the first two and some times three weeks. It completely normal. The fragile hair falls out as your hair follicles are being restored for new hair. The hair that comes through will gradually become thicker. I have found that shaving my head then using the product with the DNC treatment allows for full absorption and better performance. It also allows for the person to really massage the head gently and allow the shampoo and conditioner to work. Not to mention you do not need to use as much of the shampoo and conditioner if you do. so it may save you some money. One draw back is the price. It is really expensive! but for being just one guy with short hair, I can make the shampoo and conditioner last me almost six months. so it isnt so bad. the treatment however I do have to buy every month.</li>
    <li> I have used these two products (Revita hair growth Shampoo &amp; Conditioner) for almost a year now..and I HAVE NOT experience any hair regrowth of any kind!..It may have preserved what hair I have left, I don&#x27;t know that for sure, but certainly DID NOT make anymore grow in..Again another bogus product claim..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say in all fairness..Is that it makes me at least think that I am getting a good clean shampoo and conditioning..</li>
    <li> I have been using for about 6 weeks. At first my hair was still falling out and then it stopped. I have noticed a lot of improvement in my own hair of what I have left and my scalp feels extremely healthy. It is suppose to stimulate to regrow hair...I guess takes some time for new follicles to form and hair to grow. I will keep using.</li>
    <li> so far so good, I think it takes 6 weeks to see any difference</li>
    <li> I got this product to help with my thin and damaged hair.  It really seems to help.  I recommend it,</li>
    <li> This product really works!  I used to use propecia, and I think this shampoo/conditioner combo is equally or more effective.  My only complaint is that the conditioner bottle is poorly designed.  Conditioner tends to leak out and collect in the clear portion of the cap, making it inaccessible and wasted.</li>
    <li> Made my hair coarse , weird smell, wouln&#x27;t buy it again!  Would think about twice before purchasing the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> I have not used this product very long (2 weeks) and so far, it seems to be a good product. My biggest issues has been the design of the bottle. The conditioner bottle is fine but the shampoo will leak out if it is not vertical - so in your suitcase it may leak all over your clothes.</li>
    <li> Product is good. Manner of shipping was horrible and lost over half of it</li>
    <li> I am using these products along with a minoxidil product for hair growth.  Although it is too soon to see any new growth, the hair loss seems to have stopped or at least slowed down.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for a month but will continue the regimen as I&#x27;m feeling very hopeful that these products will help.</li>
    <li> I love the shampoo and I do think it helps with careful but I also use Indian powders and Hannah conditioning treatments really help I also take fish oil and wash my hair every day to avoid build up of bad oils</li>
    <li> Shampoo bottle always spills when travelling (even when properly sealed and taped).  Not sure how this happens, but it is very inconvenient.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not one that usually writes reviews, but I HAD to give credit where due on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been taking Propecia/Finasteride for the last 12 years with decent results, but lately I noticed my hair getting thinner and less manageable. My Barber recommended I try Revita when I made an off-hand comment about how bad my hair looked, so I ran home and looked it up online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for four weeks now and can&#x27;t being to explain how much better my hair looks. It&#x27;s growing back in places where I had noticable thin spots, and the hair I already had is much thicker and healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is worth every penny I spent, and I will continue to use the shampoo and conditioner as long as I keep getting these results.</li>
    <li> Product came damaged and had leaked quite a bit.</li>
    <li> Suffering from hairloss for years, I have tried just about everything over the years in an attempt to help the problem. I had not heard of these products and decided to give them a try as soon as I heard about them.&lt;br /&gt;They are beyond terrible.&lt;br /&gt;First off the packaging is an awful design. You need to squeeze the bottles to dispense the shampoo and conditioner and the bottles are so stiff you can&#x27;t do it with one hand, dispensing into the other palm. They are impossible to use in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;Secondly the products themselves---I tried to give it a week of using them. They leave your hair feeling heavy and greasy, and sticking flat to your scalp!&lt;br /&gt;I can honestly say this is the worst shampoo and the worst conditioner I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;Hair has NO body.&lt;br /&gt;Manufacturer claims it increases the volume of individual hairs but this is patently false. It doesn&#x27;t even give the ILLUSION OF THICKNESS!&lt;br /&gt;I am hoping I can return these products.&lt;br /&gt;Please, don&#x27;t waste your money on these products!</li>
    <li> This did nothing to help my daughter&#x27;s hair loss.  It is possibly only good to use on healthy bodies to help thicken.  We saw absolutely no difference although the shampoo itself is nice.  Not worth the money</li>
    <li> Have used the product before &amp; am happy with results. Would recommend to others. Will order again in the future.</li>
    <li> Use it for first time and waiting for results. Lets see whats next. Buy it!!! and see if its works on you.</li>
    <li> You desperately need to redesign the lid to the shampoo.  Cannot be used for travel; it leaks terribly.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t clean my hair well at all.</li>
    <li> My beautician started me using this product because my hair was thinning, without body, limp, and shedding a lot.  I began to see a difference almost immediately.  It has decreased shedding immensely, holds a set a lot longer, and is beginning to look like my old hair.  This is the only shampoo I use, and I don&#x27;t see me using anything in the future.</li>
    <li> I started using this product, along with Hairomega and generic Rogaine less than 3 months ago.  I am just starting to see some 1 inch hairs sprouting up on my scalp.  Hope that the improvement continues.  I do enjoy this product as a shampoo and conditioner, whether or not it helps with hair regrowth.</li>
    <li> I would recomend this product for anyone who is noticing hair loss.  My hair was getting noticably thinner.  When I realized that not only was my hair falling out in greater numbers but that I had no new hair growing back I started looking for a product hoping to slow down the process.  Since using DS Laboratories Revita Hair Growth Stimulating Shampoo and Conditioner my hair is not falling out in as great a volume and more importently I have hair growing back again.</li>
    <li> Makes your hair soft as silk and is a great product.  My hair grew about 2 inches using this product. Also, helps prevent split ends.</li>
    <li> I have been using these products with the serum as well for a little over 1 month.  They don&#x27;t seem to be helping me at all; I still see excessive hair loss every day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used products that worked this well! Truly a life-time customer and at first I was very skeptic though</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s the third time I am buying this combo for my husband. With first batch we almost got disappointed as we didnt see the results for more than 4 months and just as my husband told me he was going to use it up and never buy it again,during his regular haircut I noticed short black hairs growing under normal length hair, a month later there were more of them and soon his balding spot almost closed up. That was a nice surprise and I am glad we didn&#x27;t give it up. Definitely worth a try. It lathers very well so it lasts long.</li>
    <li> This product is fabulous.  Have been using it for a few months now.  My hair dresser has even commented on the thickness of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend it.  It is also a lot cheaper to purchase it on Amazon than at the salon.</li>
    <li> The package came tightly rapped but the shampoo was open and the box was soaked.  There was about 1/3 of the bottle gone.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been 4-5 months. My hair loss sped up since I started to use this product. Yet to see anything positive but hoping it will work someday.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been this shampoo and conditioner since December, what a waste of money!&lt;br /&gt;Totally INEFFECTIVE.&lt;br /&gt;The area of Canada I reside in has hard water and this does NOT lather well at all.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the ONLY shampoo I&#x27;ve ever purchased that requires you to wash your hair twice with it before using the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the bottle design is terrible, leaked shampoo ALL the time, resulting in more money wasted.&lt;br /&gt;There was no difference to my hair, only my bank account since it costs a LOT to buy it in Canada.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend anyone buy this product.</li>
    <li> Because of a thyroid problem my hair became very brittle and short.  I have been Using this product for 2 months and now have long strong hair.  Nothing else worked.  Once you get past the unpleasant odor, it really works.</li>
    <li> After reading the pamphlets that come with this product, it states that it is best for people that have just started hair loss and that it&#x27;s good for keeping what you&#x27;ve got and making it healthier and thicker. I&#x27;ve been using this product now for over 6 months and I keep buying more and more. It&#x27;s doing a great job slowing down the hair loss. It&#x27;s to a point where I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in the volume of hair only that it looks shinier and healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use pert plus because I didn&#x27;t know any better, so this is a vast improvement. I&#x27;m not sure if this is the &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; product out there, but for someone that used to use combined shampoo and conditioner and is just starting to notice hair loss, this product is for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the bottles. They leak. If you are going to travel with this product I suggest getting travel bottles and transferring what you are going to use into them.</li>
    <li> This bottle must have leaked 30% of it&#x27;s contents. When you tip it to get the shampoo out then turn it back over, the next day you have orange shampoo running down your shower. Don&#x27;t even try leaving it on it&#x27;s cap end. you will lose it all</li>
    <li> This is a really none worth it product it&#x27;s making me more bold I wish It grow my hair big and thick</li>
    <li> My husband likes this product, he says its stopping his hair from thinning. He&#x27;s 60 and still has a full head of hair and still his natural color!</li>
    <li> Product exactly as described, works well have been using for a year and a half and have seen great results in hair regrowth</li>
    <li> This product is really good my hair feels so good and I do believe it is healthy and getting thicker I would reccommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I am a 40 year old female with fine thin hair and have noticed more hair loss that I tried combating with salon products for fine hair without much success. This product absolutely works if your issue is similar to mine. After a few washes my husband even noticed and said, &amp;#34;it&#x27;s like you have a whole new head of hair!&amp;#34; My husband notices nothing, by the way. So it definitely has created fullness and I&#x27;m hopeful with continued use that it will help prevent more loss. Great Product</li>
    <li> This product lives up to its label. My hairdresser even says she notices a change in my hair loss. She says I am definitely getting hair back.</li>
    <li> Best hair products I&#x27;ve ever used, amazing results for older gentleman with thinning hair, I highly recommend it!!!!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed whether or not this is making my hair grow more, but my hair gets oily much quicker with this than with other shampoos - like it&#x27;s not getting as clean.  And the conditioner top got clogged (i think) or something the first time I used it, so now it won&#x27;t squeeze out as it&#x27;s supposed to.  I have to take the lid off, which is a minor inconvenience.  Also, the texture of the conditioner is as though it&#x27;s full of splinters.</li>
