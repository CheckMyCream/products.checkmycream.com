      <li>I was getting eyelash extensions, but this is much better.  </li>

      <li>So far it is good.  </li>
      <li>This Stuff really works!!!</li>

      <li>I just got the second one (2 pack) and loved the deal.</li>
      <li>I love it so much</li>

      <li>I have been using the same mascara for many, many years, and have never seen my lashes this nice and long.</li>
      <li>But it is DEFINITELY worth $30 and no creepy side-effects like the prescription stuff!</li>
      <li>I used Latisse (the REAL one) and it is not as good as Rapid Lash, so I reordered RAPID LASH and back to using it.  </li>
      <li>- it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
      <li>But for me, it is totally worth it...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> but I&#x27;ve only been using it for 4 weeks so perhaps with a bit more time.  I have not noticed any eyelid darkening, however, which I hear can occur.</li>
    <li> I understand that there is no difference until 2 months, so I can&#x27;t say if it will work or not. This was the lowest price on the net.</li>
    <li> Just as others have stated.  I only got one tube of this product, not one. Its outrageos that they continue to do this.  The product seems to work well, but i paid way too much for this and would like a refund.</li>
    <li> Rapid lash is less expensive than most eyelash serums. I had results in 2 weeks. My lashes became longer and less fell out. I have had to trim or pluck a few due to too long or growing in a different direction from the others. As you age your lashes grow more downward and this has helped keep my lashes stay more curled and definitly stay curled for up to 24 hrs. after curling. i have been using rapid lash for 6 months now and can tell you that one tube can last up to 4 - 5 months. I have had no side effects other than a little itch every now and then. LOVE this product!!</li>
    <li> Started to see results within four days. Does work as advertised!!!  Would recommend to friends.  Just amazing how it does work</li>
    <li> This product really works - it caused my lashes to grow in thicker and longer. I get comments from strangers on how my lashes look.  Great product!!!</li>
    <li> My lashes are as long as when I was a teenager, and my eyebrows are growing back in! Great product.</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t used it long enough to make a judgement on whether it is effective or not.  i didn&#x27;t exoect it to work overnight so will give a little time to make a fair assessment.</li>
    <li> So far it is good.  I haven&#x27;t used one whole tube yet.  My eyelash have not fallen out as some of the reviews have claimed.  I use it every two days.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but this is definitely an excellent product. I got this back in March - 2 pack, used it religiously (apply on at night everynight, missed a few days) for three months. Went on a month without it, in July bought another 2 pack, been using it since - I need to get more. In the last three months, I don&#x27;t use it religiously, even went 2 weeks without applying it - the results is great and it really stay for good! Before, apply two coats of mascara and friends still ask me, &amp;#34;Aren&#x27;t you going to apply mascara before going out?&amp;#34; I had to use an eyelash curler. Now, no eyelash curler needed, 3 coats (yes I like 3 coats) of mascara and off I go. Got tons of compliments on my eyelashes. I def recommend to every girls out there.</li>
    <li> I lost my hair, including a lot of my eyelashes and eyebrows, to cancer treatment. This product is a price-performing miracle worker! It very quickly grew back my sparse lashes and brows. Within 2 months of use, my friend asked me if I was wearing false eyelashes. Wish I could have used it on my head! It really lives up to it&#x27;s name!</li>
    <li> This product is great! My lashes are so thick and long and my eye brows are growing back. This serum is awesome.</li>
    <li> My lashes are so much longer. My friends and family are always talking about about how long my lashes are.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, even using on eye brows. Lashes definitely some thicker. Eyebrows less sparse.  Great for any age especially nice for those of us who had thick eyelashes in our youth.</li>
    <li> My lashes are not fuller or longer with daily use of this product. Maybe this was a knock-off and not the real product. I have purchased this before from a brick and mortar retailer and it worked for me then. Therefore this may be an adulterated product.</li>
    <li> It does what it claims.  Results were seen in about 2 weeks .  Well worthy the money and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I had tried a different brand &amp; noticed a small difference but RapidLash has made a big difference....so much so that people comment on my long lashes...:)</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I buy it for myself and for my 75 year old mother.&lt;br /&gt;We both get amazing results.  People ask us all the time if our lashes are real.  They are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT... I have seen some bad reviews on here and I believe that is because this product restores your lashes to what they were when you were young.  If you never had lashes you may not get results.  But if you had nice lashes when you were young and they are thinner and don&#x27;t grow as long anymore, then I would definitely try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few warnings: 1) Use too much or too often and you may have dark circles to deal with. Cut back to 3 nights a week if that happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  2) Stop using it and your lashes will go right back to what they were before you started.</li>
    <li> Wow this product really works! First I both just one, tried it and what a great results. I just got the second one (2 pack) and loved the deal.</li>
    <li> I am 61 with fine hair and lashes. Noticed my lashes getting skimpier with age... Ugh!  Bought the 2 pack and started using it faithfully. Took about 6 weeks for me to confidently say my lashes were noticeably longer (not naked lashes, but with mascara). I am now in my 10th week (still using first container/tube) and I am very impressed !  My guess is that each tube lasts about 3 months, but not exactly sure. This really worked for me. I have been using the same mascara for many, many years, and have never seen my lashes this nice and long. Again, my naked lashes look a bit longer, but its how they respond to mascara that has me hooked on this stuff.</li>
    <li> I have used this in the past and saw a difference in a matter of a couple weeks. My lashes are definitely longer and thicker. My lashes are very blonde. The ads say that lashes will be darker. I have not seen that happen with my lashes AT ALL. Also, they are not curlier either.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Latisse and Revitalash. I was ready to try something new. I was so happy to find Rapidlash cheaper than the other two products&lt;br /&gt;I used in the past and it is sold in a two pack! Double score.  After reading some of the other recent posts, I did think twice about ordering until I realized, if I buy either one of the other two, it would cost me more for just one tube.  So I took a chance.  So glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In two days I had my two pack!  I started using it right away as directed. Since I was using other products before, (just not consistently),  I saw my lashes perk up pretty quickly which confirms to me that this product will work well for my lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thinking when it&#x27;s time to reorder, this is where I will be coming.</li>
    <li> I am happy with this product . It has taken four weeks. I am noticing bottom lashes which I have not had since I was little. My top lashes are getting fuller and curling up. I will certainly be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> I get results, they aren&#x27;t dramatic or like a prescription product, but I have noticed an improvement in my eyelashes and that is all I hoped for or expected.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple of different kinds of eyelash serum, and this is the best.  No bad reactions and my lashes are very long and full.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I have past experience with this product and it works well for Me! I only wanted one (1) but My order got fouled up and I also did not get My $30.00 discount for using My Amazon credit card!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a difficult time finding a source for RapidLash and should have known that Amazon would carry it.  I&#x27;ve used it for a couple of years and it makes a world of difference in my eyelashes.  I am 81 years old and still care about how I look so it was a blessing to find it.</li>
    <li> Great but it has to be applied daily otherwise the growth stops. I use it for brows only. I don&#x27;t like the thin wand for brow application and the clear aspect of the product  which makes it difficult to tell whether there is product on the wand (and in the container) left.</li>
    <li> I am absolutely in love with this product. I had a tube sent to me a while back to try. I was skeptical that it would actually do anything, but it didn&#x27;t cost me a dime, so I tried it anyway. Boy was I surprised!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t take long for you to notice that your lashes are longer, maybe even a little bit fuller. After I finished my free tube, I quit using it. After a little while, I noticed that my lashes were back to the way they were before I ever used it. Now I&#x27;ve never had a problem with the length of my lashes or the fullness that they are naturally, but after using this product and seeing the difference, I was so disappointed that it was not a lasting effect. Needless to say, I&#x27;ve bought more of the RapidLash and I am so happy that I did!</li>
    <li> This product works !!! I have never had such a long lashes. I use it for 5 months and I still have it. You just have to be patient at the beginning and use it every evening before bedtime. I saw firs results after 2-3 weeks.</li>
    <li> This product really works.  My eye lashes are no longer short nubs, they actually grew longer.  A sparse area in my eye brow filled in.  I tried other products and this one is the only one that has worked.</li>
    <li> I could seee darker eyebrows right away, but I&#x27;m not consistant with the way I use it to rate the eyelash review.</li>
    <li> I used it on my eyebrows for 4 weeks and it helped regrow my eyebrows from an overzealous/botched waxing experience.  I recommend to everyone to try it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for several years and it definitely makes a difference.  I traveled and forgot to take with me, what a difference in just a short time of not using it.  I never let myself run out!  I also use on my eyebrows.</li>
    <li> It did make my xeyelashes grow.  I think it did my eyebrows to, but can&#x27;t really tell yet.  The first serum I got was out of date by several months.  The last one I got was OK.</li>
    <li> I use rapid lash every night, it has lengthened my eyelashes.My 80 year old mother started using it after seeing my lashes and not only are her lashes longer they are darker. My 23 year old daughter also uses it and loves it too. It is so easy to use and does what it promises, I have been using it for 3 years.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over a year, maybe 2 and if you use it on a consistent basis it does work.  Ellen Degeneris made a joke on her show...what if your lashes just keep growing and you have to put them in rollers at night...does not happen.</li>
    <li> I am 50+ and was frustrated with how thin and short my lashes had become.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if a product like this would work for me, but decided to give it a try.  Wow! after 2 weeks I could tell a difference, and now after a month of use, my lashes are as long and full as they were 20 years ago!.  I did not have any problem with eyelid darkening at all.  I would highly recommend RapidLash.</li>
    <li> Works better than some of the more expensive brands. You will see major results in just a few weeks! Love rapid lash!</li>
    <li> Great deal it was what i was looking for def will want to buy again after i run out! Thx</li>
    <li> looks nice a pretty good nice product. of course i think it would be even better if the price is more attractive.</li>
    <li> It takes several weeks of nightly applications. But after about four or five weeks, I have seen great results. My lashes are longer. Not necessarily fuller, but certainly longer.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. This is my 2nd time purchasing it, 1st time off Amazon. I love this product. My lashes have grown so much. It was less expensive to purchase it this way, the 2 for $57 then one for $35. I gave my mom the other tube since she could use some growth. I say I started to notice a difference after about 4-5 weeks. The tube will last you about 4-5 months too. I bought my first one the first week of May, and then now my second mid September. One little swipe above each lash line before bed (or once a day), is all you need. I will never stop using this. Love this stuff. Seriously!!! Don&#x27;t bother going fake lashes. Just be patient and give yourself 4-5 weeks!!!!</li>
    <li> DONT BUY THE \\&quot;TWO PACK\\&quot; of these anywhere on AMAZON especially if amazon is fulfilling the orer. As you can see from the other reviewer as well I am not the only one that has been scammed into thinking they were ordering a two pack!  Very surprised that when I called amazon&#x27;s customer service that she offered nothing but for me to return it, especially after siting where someone else had been deceived too and thought they were ordering two (previous reviewer). Seems that this person has changed the listing now to reflect something different from what I saw when I checked out. This is the second huge problem I have had with amazon not correctly filling an order and I will be going to other sites for beauty products in the future that use paypal so that I can file a complaint properly and get my refund without having to wait after an ordeal like this. I dont have time to have to constantly return stuff to amazon.</li>
    <li> My understanding from the photo was that I was buying a two pack for $54.  Instead I only received one.  Terrible advertising and very deceptive!! Not fair.</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s second round of using this product, and she&#x27;s happy enough with the results that when this order is used up she&#x27;ll order more.</li>
    <li> I used RapidLash after my Revitalash ran out.  I&amp;#34;m not happy at all with the results. My eyelashes are much shorter now and not as dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going back to Revitalash.</li>
    <li> I mainly want to address the complaints some other reviewers had that they did not receive a 2 pack. I did, which makes this an amazing deal. I hadn&#x27;t used the product before but after just 2 weeks I am seeing results and it doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes like Latisse did, plus it&#x27;s easier to use because of the applicator. I have very thin short eyelashes and so the fact that they are already thicker and longer is quite amazing.</li>
    <li> The saying, &amp;#34;You don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;ve got &#x27;til it&#x27;s gone&amp;#34; really applies to RapidLash. It makes eyelashes longer and thicker, but when you&#x27;ve run out of the product you see your lashes going back to the way they were before. I&#x27;m very skeptical of product claims, but this is one product that actually follows through on its promises!</li>
    <li> I have had success with Rapid Lash.  My eyelashes are definitely thicker and longer, and I would buy this product again.  I have never used Latisse, but for the difference in price it was worth it to us Rapid Lash!</li>
    <li> This product does work well if you use it religiously.  Although if you have sensitive eyes, you may experience a bit of irritation.</li>
    <li> I purchased a two-pack at costco used it for over 5 months with no results. Very disappointed. Only thing that has worked for me so far is latisse and lilash. Pay the extra $ for true results!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 2 years. It has GREATLY improved my upper lashes - I get lots of compliments!&lt;br /&gt;The lower lashes it doesn&#x27;t seem to affect as much.  But it is DEFINITELY worth $30 and no creepy side-effects like the prescription stuff!</li>
    <li> Told me she had seen near instant improvement within a week of using it. It has made her lashes stronger so they do not fall out when removing her mascara and look longer</li>
    <li> Even though we had some problems with shipping, the company quickly sent out another  I have used RapidLash for several years and it is very effective at getting my sparce lashes to grow.  I like the cheaper price on Amazon!!</li>
    <li> I have used Rapid lash in the past and while it did not make my lashes fuller, it definitely made them noticeably longer.  My first tube lasted a long time.  This 2 pack does not seem to have as much product.  The first tube said &amp;#34;promaxyl&amp;#34; while the 2 pack says &amp;#34;hexatein 1&amp;#34;.  Don&#x27;t know why the difference.  I won&#x27;t order from this supplier again.</li>
    <li> I have tried before RapidLash Serum and what they say about it is true.  A few years ago, I started to have less lashes and eyebrows. My sister who had good results with it recommanded it to me and I had the same success. With RapidLash my eyelashes became very thick and long after applying it once a day, in the evening, for a period of one month.  One has to be patient, the growth starts gradually but the result will be there after four weeks or less.  The serum doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate the eyes and doesn&#x27;&#x27;t affect my vision or the color of my eyes. The only negative point is that when you stop using it, you might say goodbye to your long lashes.  It will return to its former state.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a suggestion from a friend.  I used it 2 weeks and started noticing improvements.  Love it!!!!</li>
    <li> Been using this stuff for about 2 yrs....It works...Lashes thicker &amp; Longer....Dont know what happens when I stop using it....Good price..fast delivery....I&#x27;m going to keep using it as long as the prices stay down!</li>
    <li> RapidLash doesn&#x27;t work for me.  I have tried for six weeks and see no results.  Not a fan of the price or the product at this time.</li>
    <li> The product works very well but out of the 2 tubes I received one that was completely empty. So I would never recommend this product on a deal.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 3 weeks and can see a difference.  I was getting eyelash extensions, but this is much better.  Greaat product at a great price.</li>
    <li> I have only used the product for a week so it is much to early to make a determination as to whether it works</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this as a less expensive alternative to Neulash which consistently gave me great results.  I only used it every other night to circumvent possible irritation.  Applying as little as possible, I had problems preventing the gel from creeping into my eyes while I slept.  It caused a smudged eyeliner look on upper and lower lids as well as eye irritation that took several weeks to clear up after I stopped using it.  I tried to use it again a few months later and had the same negative side effects.  Back to Neulash for me!</li>
    <li> I have notice a change in my eyelashes volume.  I would recommend this to my friends who are looking for this.</li>
    <li> This Stuff really works!!! Slow at first but it kicks in and grows like crazy. Keep it up do not be discouraged.</li>
    <li> Works as described! Use it twice daily to speed things up maybe?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other products are runny, but this is a gel &amp; stays put, &amp; burns minimally, if at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been purchasing this item from Ulta and for 1 is around $40. The fact that I can get TWO for close to the price of one with my free 2-day shipping is an AMAZING DEAL! I&#x27;ve used the prescription eyelash enhancer&#x27;s and for me, RapidLash works better AND so much cheaper. I get a ton of compliments on my lashes being so long. Love this product!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Yes it takes about 2 months to see results but when you do....wowza! I had people every day asking me what type of mascara I used cuz my lashes were so long. Only I was using the same mascara I had used for years.&lt;br /&gt;And to all the brainiacs that claim their product was past the \\&quot;expiration date\\&quot;......its a MANUFACTURED date printed on the tube. Its not expired. You just threw away a $50 product for no reason.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a least 2 years.  I totally believe in it.  Of course, my lashes don&#x27;t grow so long and thick that I don&#x27;t need mascara (what a dream that would be!).  My lashes have gotten longer and definately healthier.  They don&#x27;t break off anymore.  I use an eyelash primer and then mascara and my lashes really look much longer.  I wash off the mascara nightly, as it is so important as the dry mascara can break down lashes but I can skip doing this some of the time, as long as I use my Rapidlash all the other times.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I purchased this product. it has made my lashes really beautiful. I didn&#x27;t need to go crazy and spend alot on &amp;#34;another&amp;#34; product. Rapid Lash does all I need.</li>
    <li> After breast cancer treatments last year and turning 48 this year, my eyelashes and eyebrows aren&#x27;t the same. All my eyelashes will still drop off every 6 weeks. So, after getting an ok from my dr, I finally broke down and bought Rapidlash. Price was right, especially since I just wanted to try it. I&#x27;ve been using it for over three weeks and I see an improvement both with my lashes and brows. I&#x27;m not sure how long they&#x27;ll grow, or how thick they&#x27;ll get, but I&#x27;m happy that they are growing and I have more of them. If they help from losing them every 6 weeks, I&#x27;ll be even happier. I think a product like this takes time to see full results, just as with anti-aging products, etc. If this product produces even longer and stronger lashes than I&#x27;ve already achieved, I&#x27;ll be incredibly happy. But I love this product. Like other viewers have said, goes on easily, no drips and dries quickly. I bought a two pack from Costco for a little under this price, which should last me 4 months. Got worried Costco would stop carrying it so ordered another two pack. Thankfully I did...they stopped carrying it a week ago. Whew. But, Amazon has a good price, too, so it&#x27;s good to know I can get it here, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I&#x27;ve been using this product now for over 6 weeks and my eyelashes almost touch eyebrows. They&#x27;re that long. It did take 4+ weeks to see dramatic results. Brows are growing int, too. Love, love, love this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2 - 6 months later. All my lashes have been falling out the past two days. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because, at some point, your lashes need to go through a growth cycle and RapidLash doesn&#x27;t allow that to happen - so your lashes just finally fall out, or if the product is damaging. We&#x27;ll have to wait and see. Brows are still doing great. Only using once a day, at night, as suggested.</li>
    <li> My eyes were my best feature until aging caused my lashes started to thin and break. Although my natural lashes were straight, they had been long and fairly thick. I customarily used a lash curler during the week and only had to use mascara on date nights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was reluctant to try the prescription lash enhancer because of the scary side effects. I bought a natural lash enhancer, but had to stop using it because of an allergic reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After three weeks of using RapidLash, I needed far less mascara and was able to stop wearing false  eyelashes. I&#x27;ve now been using the product for four weeks, and can see my &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; lashes coming back. They&#x27;re still straight, but long. Looking forward to seeing an increase in volume, but am happy with the results!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this product working as advertised.....IT WORKS!  My eye lashes have gotten longer and thicker....will continue to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> This is a great eyelash enhancing syrum. I strongly considering using it before&lt;br /&gt;purchasing Latisse--it&#x27;s much more expensive. Main thing is to follow directions and&lt;br /&gt;be sure to apply it nightly for maximum results. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I ordered thisnot for me, but for my mother and my sister and they both like it. it works for them</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 8 weeks. IT WORKS! My lashes are easily twice as long as they were 2 months ago and while not as thick as I&#x27;d like them to be, I definitely have more lashes than I started with. I started noticing a few freakishly long lashes at about 2 weeks and by 1 month all the rest of my lashes had caught up. About week 6 I noticed a bunch of new short stubby lashes growing in and now they&#x27;re almost as long as the rest. This stuff really works for me...and the results are fast!  I&#x27;ll post an update in another month or 2 and let you know if it keeps getting better. This is a good price for it, too. I will keep on buying it.&lt;br /&gt;  P.S. I&#x27;m 58, so it DOES work on old thinning lashes!</li>
    <li> I absolutely notice a difference in the thickness of my lashes, and consequently in how thin they become when I stop using.  And, that is the thing, you have to keep using it.  But for me, it is totally worth it...and this is good price.</li>
    <li> Works pretty good after two weeks.  A little expensive but then what isn&#x27;t expensive these days.  I do recommend trying it.  Didn&#x27;t do much for my eyebrows but yes my eyelashes are longer.</li>
    <li> I use this every night on my eyebrows.  Without it, my eyebrows would be very sparse and light, with it they are much fuller and dark enough to match my hair color.  I LUV this product and will continue to use it - it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this product for too long but the results that have been appearing have been subtle. I&#x27;m sure with continuous regular use my lashes will be growing like crazy</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for weeks and have not noticed any difference in the length of my eyelalshes!</li>
    <li> Thanks to RapidLash my once thinning eyelashes and eyebrows have regrown in their original dark color.  I use less mascara and just need only brush my eyebrows.</li>
    <li> All my friends who was using this serum are happy. I see results personally (I&#x27;m a guy lol) it doesn&#x27;t make you look feminine if you have a beautiful eyes</li>
    <li> I really can&#x27;t say I hate this product.  I never got to use it.  When I received it, it was 4 months out of date, so I sent it back immediately.  I have not re-ordered the product, as I do not want to take the chance of getting another old set.  I don&#x27;t think this should have happened.  How can a company sell out of date products?</li>
    <li> I have used it for almost a week and how found no difference.  I do not feel it is work the money at all.  To me it was a waste.</li>
    <li> I now have lashes again, You must keep using this product or you loss the lashes you have gained.I get lots of compliments!</li>
    <li> I used rapid lash first, and had great results.  A few weeks into using this, I noticed my lashes a little longer,  a couple weeks later realized my eyelashes were CURLY.  I had always HAD to curl my lashes before.  Finally I threw away my eyelash curler, never needed again.  Then...........well............I tried some other things.  I used Latisse (the REAL one) and it is not as good as Rapid Lash, so I reordered RAPID LASH and back to using it.  The price is SO much less than latisse and the produce SO much better and so much easier to use too.  LOVE  IT</li>
    <li> I have a thyroid condition that caused some of my body hair to stop growing ( leg hair, underarms etc.)  While most women would say great, this also affected my eyebrows ans lashes.  As a result, my eyebrows were very thin and mostly invisible .  My lashes, well, they&#x27;re a lost cause.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different &amp;#34;growth enhancers&amp;#34; with high ratings, got some results but not what I was expecting.  Bupkiss, nada.  I decided to try Rapid Lash before giving up.  I&#x27;m a control person when it comes to me, so I used the RL a few times a day.  I could see results pretty quick.  To keep my brows from falling out again, I continue to use it twice a day.  The cost on Amazon is usually pretty good when they have a sale ($30), so I stock up whenever they are discounted and, especially, when they have their Supersaver Shipping offers.  While my brows are getting gray, I do tint them about once a month.  You can buy this on Amazon as well.  It&#x27;s simple, safe and only takes 2-3 mins to get the desired shade.  So, would I recommend this product to a friend?  Yes, but explaining that my personal experience is not typical.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best eyelash serum on the market. My lashes were very noticeably thicker and longer after 6 weeks of consistently applying on my upper lash line every night. I ran out months ago and my lashes returned to their previous length and thickness, but I just received my two-pack and I&#x27;m excited to have my lashes back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have any issue with my order - I received 2 in my package!</li>
    <li> Really works, if you are first time user give it a few weeks!  People will start to notice and comment on your long lashes.</li>
    <li> When I read reviews on the internet I was skeptical but I had a 25% off coupon and $5 at CVS so I figured I take a chance.  After two weeks of applying it every night I noticed the difference.  My lashes were deepening in color and within 4 weeks my lashes were so much thicker.  I could tell this because I had an area on the lash line that was sparse and within the 4 weeks it had filled in.  Make the investment...it&#x27;s well worth it!  I got it on the interest so much cheaper.</li>
    <li> i got this because i used li lash (works AMAZINGLY) but unfortunately I was allergic to it (my eyelids got itchy and a pinkish color..... I love it so much i think ill order again anyway)    i saw no change in my lashes after using it for 1 month.  pink eyelids i can deal with, but not a blackish discoloration under my eyes- i looks exceptionally tired.  Im reeeeeally sad it didnt work for me- its not at all as irritation as li lash.  But the side effect of dark under eyes was too much for me to want to continue.    what&#x27;s another product?!?!? I LOVE lashes!!!!!! Li Lash is the S***!!!!!!!!! IT WORKS!!!!! because i was allergic to it, mine lasted me a year (i used it every day for a month, then maybe 1 a week after)    but rapid lash? nothing for me :(</li>
    <li> I initially purchased RapidLash in an effort to thicken my thinning eyebrows.  As long as I was applying it anyway, I went ahead and applied to my upper lash line as well, not really expecting results but satisfying my curiosity.  I&#x27;ve been using this daily for 10 weeks now and my lashes are much longer, and are recently starting to appear thicker as well. They seem to be continuing to improve, so I guess how long it takes to achieve maximum results is a very individual thing. My lashes had always been short and sparse.  I&#x27;m really enjoying putting on mascara these days.  In fact, I&#x27;ve always had to wear eyeliner in addition to mascara to give my eyes any definition at all.  Now I have to be careful to go really light on the eyeliner; otherwise my eyes actually look overdone.  Never thought I&#x27;d have that as a problem....I&#x27;ll happily take it, though.  This has worked well to thicken my brows also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve not experienced any of the side effects others have mentioned....or any side effects whatsoever.  The product lasts a long time.  After 10 weeks of daily liberal use on brows and lashes, I&#x27;m just about at the end of one of the two tubes.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I love this product! Definitely made a difference in my eyelashes! Highly recommend. Easy to use and results are fast.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product now for several weeks and have no seen no improvement or results at all.</li>
    <li> I admit...I was skeptical...but thought for $30 I&#x27;d give it a shot.  My lashes are fairly long...not as long as I&#x27;d like...but light.  I hate to wear mascara and was looking for a little more &amp;#34;punch&amp;#34; to my real lashes.  This stuff works.  Seriously.  Not only are my lashes longer...top AND bottom...but also a bit darker.  The key is consistency though...you have to use it every night...which is no big deal...takes a second to apply.  And give it a few weeks to &amp;#34;kick in&amp;#34;  Once you do you will LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I like this product but when I received it I looked at the expiration of this product date and was disappointed to find it expired a year earlier.  This is like buying lunch meat in the store a year expired ...Yuk!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m thinking the product expired. Also very little in the containers. The same  previous products purchased were not comparable to this order.</li>
</ol>
