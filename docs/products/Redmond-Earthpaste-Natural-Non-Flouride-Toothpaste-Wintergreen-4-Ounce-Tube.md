      <li>I do love how clean it leaves your mouth feeling - but need something a bit thicker if I want my husband to be able to share my toothpaste :)</li>
      <li>The taste is okay, and it really does a great job at getting my teeth clean.</li>
      <li>Great natural toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>Very nice tasting natural toothpaste.  </li>

      <li>Flavor is not too strong.  </li>
      <li>The wintergreen is fairly strong but not overpowering, and the cinnamon is the mildest.</li>
      <li>Such a great toothpaste with clean ingredients!</li>
      <li>and I really feel in love with it!</li>
      <li>the flouride free tooth paste my wife was purchasing at the supermarket.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
      <li>Was looking for a flouride free and chemical free toothpaste.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so excited to have found this.</li>
      <li>It keeps our teeth clean all day and it tastes</li>
      <li>I like the product seems very healthy and doesn&#x27;t dry out the mouth pleased with it.</li>
      <li>(Ok ready?</li>
      <li>It cleans my teeth wonderfully,  is quite affordable,  &amp; best of all is free of nasty chemicals.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite flavor, leaves a minty flavor the peppermint is very mild.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My husband has a mouth full of metal and he yet again could feel a cavity coming on.</li>
      <li>I just got back from the dentist, after not going for 2 1/2 years, and they couldn&#x27;t believe how good everything looked.</li>
      <li>It keeps our teeth clean and fresh all day.</li>
      <li>PREGNANT WOMEN -- DO NOT USE.</li>
      <li>The ingredients include lead-unsafe for pregnant women.</li>

      <li>Other then the taste, as stated before one of the best natural toothpaste you can buy.</li>
      <li>but I feel like it&#x27;s worth it.</li>

      <li>we&#x27;re accustomed to, but its well worth it.</li>
      <li>Not crazy about Cinnamon at all</li>
      <li>I loved the flavor and knowing that it was natural and chemical free -- but the texture (or lack thereof) was so different from what we are used to -- as soon as you put it in your mouth</li>
      <li>I am always on the look out for more natural products and this was recommended to me by a friend.  </li>
      <li>I love that my 2 year old can swallow it without me worrying how it will effect him.</li>
      <li>The only kind I buy now.</li>
      <li>I really wanted a natural toothpaste and have even tried making my own.</li>
      <li>This has been terrific, and the price is very reasonable compared to most organic toothpastes!</li>
      <li>LEAD is a major toxin for our bodies and to say that there is a safe amount is an oxymoron.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product, great prices. Trusty Amazon service/delivery.</li>
    <li> I was trying to find a fluoride free toothpaste that was natural and safe to use with the entire family and I found it! The t extrude of the toothpaste was something to get used to but after a few bushings, we fell in love with it. It keeps our teeth clean and fresh all day.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I found Earth Paste! It cleans my teeth wonderfully,  is quite affordable,  &amp; best of all is free of nasty chemicals.</li>
    <li> Very interesting.  Was looking for a flouride free and chemical free toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Love this toothpaste!</li>
    <li> It takes a little bit to get over brushing your teeth with brown muddy looking stuff as opposed to the white gleaming paste we&#x27;re accustomed to, but its well worth it. My husband has a mouth full of metal and he yet again could feel a cavity coming on. He started using this stuff and his tooth no longer hurts. He hasn&#x27;t been to the dentist but with his level of experience with cavities, I think he would definitely know if the cavity was continuing to form. I&#x27;ve never had cavities and hope I will continue with great oral health by using this stuff. I will say that I have noticed the plaque on the bottom inner side of my teeth has completely dissolved. I&#x27;ve never been someone to go to the dentist much, probably 3x in 15 years, and always excellent checkups. This stuff has gotten off what I typically accrue between my every few years&#x27; cleaning.</li>
    <li> Very nice tasting natural toothpaste.  One of the best.</li>
    <li> Very good product just accidently picked the wrong flavor, taste like Pepto Bismol, but it was my fault so I can&#x27;t really blame the product. Other then the taste, as stated before one of the best natural toothpaste you can buy.</li>
    <li> Very happy with both the product and the service.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Nowhere does it state to notify poison control if i accidentally swallow too much.</li>
    <li> minimum ingredients, as natural as it can be. I only wish it would be a little less expensive. And I definitely recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I have begun using essential oils and learned that Wintergreen essential oil is toxic even at small amounts. It is not recommended to ingest even by the FDA. I talked to an employee of Native American Nutritionals asking if it is safe since the toothpaste clearly states on the container that it is safe to eat. They and more sources recommend not to. So although I like the toothpastes overall, the wintergreen flavored toothpaste is NOT safe to eat, since on the ingredient list it clearly states wintergreen essential oil. They need to take the \\&quot;safe to eat\\&quot; statement off for those who are unaware and who trust this company like I did. Especially if given to children since they like to swallow the toothpaste!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their response to me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It says Wintergreen Essential oil and not Wintergreen food grade oil? If it&#x27;s the essential oil, don&#x27;t swallow it. Wintergreen flavoring is okay to swallow. And food grade oils are different than essential oils. -- Shannon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the statement from Native American Nutritionals:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are certain oils you should never ingest -- and this is industry wide, not just with us. They are Eucalyptus Globulus, Eucalyptus Radiata, Wintergreen, Birch Bark, Artemesia, and Pennyroyal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The easiest thing to do is follow the FDA&#x27;s GRAS (Generally Regarded As Safe) list, as well. We indicate in the product descriptions which oils are GRAS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though topical and aroma are still the best methods of application. -- Shannon</li>
    <li> This is by far the best flavor of all!!!  Not crazy about Cinnamon at all but that&#x27;s only my opinion!</li>
    <li> I switched away from the standard Crest/Colgate toothpastes a few years ago, as the SLS ingredient was causing canker sores. I was using Squiggle for about 4 years, before trying out Earthpaste. I&#x27;m happy I switched. Earthpaste has a fresher taste, and I like the consistency. Be prepared for brown toothpaste, especially if you&#x27;ve only known white and blue. The only improvement I&#x27;d make at this point is a flip cap, instead of a screw cap, as it would save me a few seconds each day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll never use another brand</li>
    <li> Another great flavor from Earthpaste.  1 bottle came out a little wet thought and I shook it and it didn&#x27;t seem to mix well.  But I can&#x27;t complain it&#x27;s Earthpaste!</li>
    <li> I have been using Earthpaste for several months now and I have to say it is the best tooth paste I have tried. The main reason for my assessment is the all natural ingredients that are not lethal and harmful as mainstream toothpastes that contain fluoride, glycerin, sodium laurel sulfate and other harmful ingredients. My teeth look just as good as when I used mainstream toothpaste and it leaves my mouth with a fresh minty feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend Earthpaste to anyone interested in their and/or family&#x27;s overall health.</li>
    <li> I like it very much.  I just wished it foamed more</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read about this toothpaste on numerous blogs and I always wondered how it would taste. It tastes great. I really wanted a natural toothpaste and have even tried making my own. The problem with making your own is unless you have it in a tube, it&#x27;s a pain to apply on your brush. I&#x27;ve also noticed my teeth were getting dingy because I drink coffee every day. With the Earthpaste, I feel like it keeps my teeth much cleaner and the best part is all the ingredients are natural. Yes, it&#x27;s a little pricey but I feel like it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> This is the first time is tried Earth Paste and I really feel in love with it! It takes a little getting used to at first because it&#x27;s brown and doesn&#x27;t not foam like all the toothe pastes on the market. I love that my 2 year old can swallow it without me worrying how it will effect him. The taste is great and my husband is liking it too! I&#x27;m in the process of trying to heal my teeth naturally and this toothpaste is helping.</li>
    <li> We bought a 3-pack because of the great value.  I am always on the look out for more natural products and this was recommended to me by a friend.  I loved the flavor and knowing that it was natural and chemical free -- but the texture (or lack thereof) was so different from what we are used to -- as soon as you put it in your mouth it is liquid -- no &amp;#34;pasty&amp;#34; about it.  I do love how clean it leaves your mouth feeling - but need something a bit thicker if I want my husband to be able to share my toothpaste :)</li>
    <li> Great product! I just got back from the dentist, after not going for 2 1/2 years, and they couldn&#x27;t believe how good everything looked. No cavities, or any other issues at all. They told me &amp;#34;keep doing whatever you are doing&amp;#34;. :) My mouth feels cleaner with Earthpaste than it does with conventional toothpaste too. I&#x27;ll never go back.</li>
    <li> My Earthpaste arrived! I can&#x27;t wait to brush my teeth!....brush brush....brush brush....thinking of the good day that I had....then I look down at the box on the counter and see the LEAD warning! (Prop65)....I had then froze and didn&#x27;t know what to think. A million thoughts when on in my mind....WHAT THE ??????? .....LEAD? So I got to thinking....obviously it had to do with the clay (no brainer) so my next thought was, &amp;#34;...so just how much LEAD is in here?&amp;#34; -- There&#x27;s a website listed on the box (http://www.earthpaste.com/prop65/) that you can go to for more info. It&#x27;s prettied up and explains the Prop65 in California. --- Regardless, it&#x27;s very unsettling at the least. The fact is....THERE IS NO SAFE AMOUNT FOR LEAD!  Update: The so called safe limit of lead in drinking water is 15 ppb. (That&#x27;s 15 parts per billion). Now ready?....Earthpaste from their very own tests showed 11.9 ppm. (Ok ready? That&#x27;s 11.9 parts per MILLION.) - Get it? That&#x27;s 1,260 TIMES MORE LEAD than the so called safe limit of 15ppb in drinking water!  Earthpaste themselves have tested the amount of LEAD in the earthpaste at 11.9 parts per million. However, 15 parts per billion of LEAD in water is considered toxic! --- Did you get that? 11.9 parts per million vs 15 parts per billion. There is WAY more LEAD in Earthpaste many times over than the so called safe amount of 15BPM in water!  I really thought I had scored with this Earthpaste with it not having glycerin, fluoride and all the other chemicals. I guess not.  My search is on again for another toothpaste. There is no way in heck I&#x27;m letting my kids use this stuff.  Earthpaste, why don&#x27;t you disclose the amount of LEAD in your toothpaste on the label? On the website you mention 6mcg, but even that is a little unsettling, considering you&#x27;ve already admitted to 11.9 parts per million of LEAD from your very own tests.  You should provide more detailed information about your claims of how natural lead doesn&#x27;t absorb into our body? Are yousure???? You make great mention about how it compares to certain organic veggies, but please provide more information and be more up front about it.  All your down playing just sounds like a cover up.  Gosh this reminds me of the fluoride battle in toothpaste....Not all &#x27;stuff&#x27; is created equal...and some things are what they are.  LEAD is a major toxin for our bodies and to say that there is a safe amount is an oxymoron.</li>
    <li> I really like this toothpaste. It has a great flavor and you do not have to worry about being poisoned by it. All the foaming stuff and fluoride is not needed since tap water has fluoride in it. Went to get my teeth cleaned and dentist reported my teeth were just as clean as when I used the regular toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I first bought a pack of four tubes - each flavor. I liked Wintergreen the best, so I bought this pack of three tubes. I have been using Earthpaste for at least a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Earthpaste was great. I had less tarter and fewer 4 mm pockets at my last dental checkup in May. Even then, I did not inform my dentist that one of my molars was hurting whenever I&#x27;d eat sweets. I wanted to see what the x-rays showed... And was surprised there were no cavities. So I dismissed the molar issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the issue has spread to the next two little molars so now when I eat sweets, three molars ache. I googled around... It is a common condition called Dentin Hypersensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sad to say, it has become apparent that Earthpaste does not prevent Or treat this condition, which includes killing bacteria and reducing acidity caused by the combination of saliva and sugars - all leading to tooth sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am buying a different set of products designed for such conditions. Earthpaste is still good and I&#x27;ll still use it every now and then.</li>
    <li> My toddler has been using this since she got teeth and she loves it. Also, I don&#x27;t feel bad about all the nasty chemicals because there aren&#x27;t any! Win win!</li>
    <li> Great product, no yucky stuff in it!</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste! I have had cavities my whole life and thought I needed toothpaste with fluoride but since I&#x27;ve started using this I haven&#x27;t had a single cavity. wintergreen is my favorite flavors of the ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is the best I&#x27;ve ever had.  I had sensitivities and other problems my whole life which all disappeared after I began using this product.  My teeth feel so smooth and clean now compared to other toothpastes that would leave a film on my teeth.</li>
    <li> Due to allergies I am not able to use regular toothpaste.  This has been terrific, and the price is very reasonable compared to most organic toothpastes!</li>
    <li> I like the product seems very healthy and doesn&#x27;t dry out the mouth pleased with it.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is really great.  The non-foaming aspect is different if you&#x27;re switching from conventional toothpaste, but I easily adjusted to it.  It&#x27;s great for kids who like to swallow toothpaste, because it&#x27;s edible.  It also cleans my teeth really well.  I experimented with using this and then switching back to conventional paste, and I did not get any cavities while using this, but I got 3 cavities after I switched back.  (And all other factors were equal- I didn&#x27;t brush my teeth more or change my diet or lifestyle, or even brush at a different time of day.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside to this is that the flavor is pretty strong.  I&#x27;d recommend the cinnamon flavor for kids and those of us who prefer a milder flavor.  I&#x27;ve found the peppermint flavor to be the strongest.  The wintergreen is fairly strong but not overpowering, and the cinnamon is the mildest.</li>
    <li> Not suitable for Human use product contains Mercury a poisonous heavy metal/mineral.</li>
    <li> Best toothpaste ever. Works really well and keeps my teeth white. Love how natural it is and that it does not contain glycerin. Naturally allows my teeth to heal themselves.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste. It has a good flavor and I feel like it is improving the sensitivity of my teeth.</li>
    <li> Love this tooth paste, NO Flouride!</li>
    <li> Such a great toothpaste with clean ingredients!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only tried the Wintergreen, but I love it. It&#x27;s actually a great tasting and great cleansing organic product! Yes!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for several years for a natural toothpaste with few ingredients that was easy to use.  I think it may actually not only prevent tartar buildup but also get rid of tartar that has already accumulated.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for two months but my last cleaning at the dentist was very quick.  I had less tartar than I have had in over 20 years.  It&#x27;s great stuff.</li>
    <li> While it cleans your teeth - I&#x27;ve noticed that bad breath issues is still an issue.  Found fluoride-free and alcohol-free mouthwash and we&#x27;re set to go!</li>
    <li> wonderful product, great for your teeth, and chemical free !!</li>
    <li> Came quickly and was packaged/sealed perfectly! My kids love this toothpaste and LOOK FORWARD to brushing! Without all the nasty fluoride! Will definitely be buying this again and again!!</li>
    <li> Giving all of my coin to RTC</li>
    <li> I really like this toothpaste, I don&#x27;t like foaming toothpastes and this one is great because it doesn&#x27;t foam.  Taste is okay, but a little too much wintergreen for me, but the rest of my family likes it the way it is.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long though, would be great if it came in larger tubes.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve been using other natural toothpastes, you may be slightly put off by the muddy appearance, but it is an excellent toothpaste especially if your really concerned about your tooth enamel and avoiding anything unnatural.  The mineral clay is to help remineralize tooth enamel and there is no glycerin to soften it.  Flavor is not too strong.  Looking forward to trying their other flavors.</li>
    <li> Excellent! Love this flavor and product and the service has been great.</li>
    <li> I really likethis toothpaste, it is very different, becauseit has grey colour, and tastes also different (some may not like it but for me it is ok) i makles my teeth whiter, and cleans well. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> PREGNANT WOMEN -- DO NOT USE. Or anyone really. This stuff has a warning label to pregnant women due to toxic ingredients.  Also, it tastes awful.  I bought this to avoid fluoride and now use TOM&#x27;S without fluoride and I love it.</li>
    <li> Good product, would recommend as it is fluoride-free toothpaste. This toothpaste has a different texture compared to conventional ones, but is effective.</li>
    <li> The ingredients include lead-unsafe for pregnant women. Returned.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste certainly is different. The taste is okay, and it really does a great job at getting my teeth clean.</li>
    <li> Kids like the taste and it&#x27;s not too &amp;#34;spicy&amp;#34;.  They complain about the peppermint one.</li>
    <li> It keeps our teeth clean all day and it tastes good!&lt;br /&gt;We have teenagers and little ones all of whom use this with no complaints.</li>
    <li> all about the flouride,how it is used in rat poison,really bad stuff.&lt;br /&gt;This tooth paste cleans alot better then the flouride free tooth paste my wife was purchasing at the supermarket.&lt;br /&gt;Also this stuff has a good taste.Price is good.</li>
    <li> Love love love this toothpaste :-) no weirdo ingredients, and the wintergreen flavor is the best.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a toothpaste that didn&#x27;t have chemicals in it, but still is able to leave my mouth feeling clean. I also didn&#x27;t want something that cost a ridiculous amount. Well, thank you Earthpaste!!!  I&#x27;m so excited to have found this. It&#x27;s all of the things I was looking for and I&#x27;ll definitely be using this in the future.</li>
    <li> I love the toothpaste - flavor not overpowering and my teeth feel very clean with out the residue and film that Crest or Colgate would leave in my mouth.</li>
    <li> Great natural toothpaste.  The only kind I buy now.</li>
    <li> Really love the taste of this toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost a year. I had degraded teeth due to radiation treatment for cancer. My teeth were gray and decaying. My teeth are no longer gray and the decay has greatly improved.&lt;br /&gt;It is different without the foaminess but you get used to it. This is my favorite flavor, leaves a minty flavor the peppermint is very mild.&lt;br /&gt;It is a little more cleaning maintenance of the sink but likely seems more messy because it isn&#x27;t white so it is more visible on a white sink. Not a big deal.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!!!!</li>
