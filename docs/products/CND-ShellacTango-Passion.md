      <li>very nice color my clients really like this color.</li>
      <li>Bright, pretty color.</li>
      <li>The color on my computer monitor looks like a bright vibrant purple/fusha.</li>
      <li>Smooth formula and easily opaque.</li>
      <li>It came on time and was an accurate color match.</li>
      <li>It went on smooth.</li>
      <li>Lovely color and a little shimmery..was a pleasant surprize :)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s rich.</li>
      <li>This a great color for young or older.</li>
      <li>Very pretty color, can&#x27;t wait for the summer to get here.</li>
      <li>and this is very pretty for summer.  </li>
      <li>Unless it is in bright sunlight, it looks quite dark.</li>
      <li>then the bottle shows but still pretty.</li>
      <li>The color is rather sheer, so I layered it over Wildfire, which created a nice combination of rich wine and beet red.</li>
      <li>Very vibrant</li>
      <li>This color was a much darker purple than I was expecting.</li>
      <li>I prefer cream over shimmer, but I really do like the color.</li>
      <li>I use the UV light because it shines brighter when finished compared to the LED light which leaves it dull.</li>

      <li>This polish arrived much faster than I expected.</li>
      <li>Nice color, but very thin.</li>
      <li>So much easier to remove than other gel nail products</li>
