<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Have used this product for years!  Supplier shipped in a timely manner.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> This product is a staple in my skin care regime. Been using it for the last 15 years or so.and keeps my face moisturized.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer for my 50-something face and neck and chest. Nice feel, not greasy.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for! Have used before and love it. Will definitely order again. I just love Mary Kay.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer feels great on my skin.  It absorb easily and fast.  Its doesn&#x27;t give you a dewy and slickly feels, but a smooth and refreshed feeling.  I use this wonderful produce alone with other Mary Kay products and with other products. With the other non Mary kay products, you&#x27;ll gets same refreshing feeling.</li>
    <li> Good price, works great. All I need is this moisturizer and my face stays looking young and clear. I love Mary Kay.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time.  It&#x27;s all I use.</li>
    <li> Have used this for years .  I really like it</li>
    <li> My name is Sandy McKenzie, and I am a Mary Kay Beauty Consultant in Okaloosa County. I was once told by my Director that it is against the policy of Mary Kay to sell products on Amazon and Ebay. Mary Kay is not a retail store, so it is not with the guidelines to sell products in this way. I would think if the Consultant is not longer active selling back her products to the company is within the proper guidelines. I wish the people looking at products on these sites would take this into thought and look on the Mary Kay website to seek out a Consultant in their area to purchase product. I personally would rather sell product to a customer at a discount than to see them pruchase product in a manner not within MK guidelines. I understand these prices are perhaps, too good to pass up, but please take these words into consideration. If you wish, you may look up my name on the Mary Kay website and get in touch with me and I&#x27;m be happy to assist you with products (and yes with a discount). Thank you.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without this stuff!  I have been using this product for years!  I have been in a bind because my Mary Kay rep had another baby and is too busy to take orders!  After being without it for a month my face feels like a prune!  I shop Amazon for everything and so happy to find it here but not surprised!</li>
    <li> Very good facial moisturizer. I&#x27;ve been using for several years now.</li>
    <li> always order online for this product.  It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Good seller.  No problems.  Shipped promptly</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 24 and have used Neutrogena&#x27;s regular face moisturizer for the last 12 years.  During winters, I&#x27;ve fought with flaking on my upper cheeks and lower forehead, applying several times a day, and using an ancient Bath &amp; Body Works day/night mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friend highly recommended this Mary Kay product--she happily switched from Neutrogena--and gave it to me for Christmas.  Initially I was put off by the chemical smell (familiar to many \\&quot;age-fighting\\&quot; creams), and after dries on my face, it gives a dry, cracking feeling.  (Also I don&#x27;t want to become dependent on age creams at such a young age--my skin is great, thanks to using Retin-A for acne for 10 years, &amp; not sunbathing.)  Over one month slowly began to peel worse than before.  Now whole sheets are coming off.  A friend suggested this could be due to the age-fighting chemicals shedding \\&quot;dead\\&quot; skin, but I&#x27;m not happy with flakes and sheets of skin everywhere--including my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must give one plus, though: no SPF! Therefore no sunscreen smell, and it allows me to convert the Vit D in my skin during the short times I have outside.  I continue to search store shelves high and low for no SPF--and no ageless chemicals.</li>
    <li> Love this face lotion! Very light and makes my face so soft. Not overly oily as I already have oily skin.</li>
    <li> I seriously would NOT leave the house without this on my face under my  makeup.  It&#x27;s like my face knows that it&#x27;s time to put it on and just drinks it up!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with my order with Pink Boutique. It was very timely and exactly what I wanted at an excellent price.     -------</li>
    <li> My T-zone tends to be dry/flaky during the winter months.  Since I have received and used this product, no more dryness and I have received compliments on how &amp;#34;nice&amp;#34; my complexion looks.  I am a former Mary Kay consultant and will always use the facial care products.  When spring/summer returns, I shall try the Hydrating Gel or switch to using my regular normal/combo skin moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great price and fits within my budget.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for many years and will for many to come. Helps to keep my skin moisturized and younger looking. At 68 I&#x27;m often mistaken for someone in her 50\\&quot;s!</li>
    <li> I love the smell and my face feels refreshed after using it!</li>
    <li> I love Mary Kay moisturizer products.  I use the Time Wise Moisturizer, along with Day and Night cream.</li>
    <li> I had an explosion of red on my forehead, cheeks, and eye area----this was fantastic!!!  It took away the dryness and the red.  I am using this exclusively for my face both evening and morning.  It is great!!</li>
    <li> Mom&#x27;s enjoying her gift!</li>
    <li> Granddaughter uses it and likes it.</li>
    <li> the moisturizer arrived on time.  I like the results.</li>
    <li> Love the Time Wise products!  I have eczema and my skin is flawless and everyone thinks that I am 8-10 years younger than I am.  LOVE THAT!  I never have problems with my skin using this product and even though it is age fighting, I get NO redness, irritation or anything to that effect.  If anything is soothes my skin.  I use it with the cleanser, micro dermabrasion set and the Vitamin C cream.  LOVE the vitamin c cream.  I live in the mountains and it is very close to the sun and very thin oxygen and dry air.  Double no for eczema and in winter when the heat is on in the house it is a triple threat.  I used Clinique thirsty skin once to try it out and I liked it but the Time Wise is MUCH better. Will buy again and again.  Seller was fast and in perfect condition in the box!</li>
    <li> I like the way it makes my face feel. It softens the skin. I buy this product regularly.</li>
    <li> My wife purchased this product and I have been using it as well. This winter has been particularly cold and my skin has had a tendency to dry out. I find that my face is much more comfortable when I use this product. We have also started using humidifiers in the house which helps to decrease skin dryness.</li>
    <li> This lotion isn&#x27;t greasy, doesn&#x27;t smell, and helps fight wrinkles. I have been using it since I was in my 20&#x27;s and have been told I look younger than women my age.</li>
    <li> Been using Mary Kay moisturizers for over 25 yrs......Thought maybe the new line would not be as good...but works absolutely great.....</li>
    <li> I am 23 since I lost a lot of weight I have very dry skin. I will get a \\&quot;are you tired\\&quot; all day every day!!! Since I bought the miracle set my life and face changed. I get complements often and feel great about my skin.... Recommend for tired looking face and eyes also</li>
    <li> Have used this moisturizer for at least 35 years--Love it! Was also cheaper&lt;br /&gt;than what I usually pay! Anytime I can save mo0ney I&#x27;m happy!</li>
    <li> I have skin that is sensitive to products with sun screen in them. I have used this in the past and knew that it worked. Finding it on amazon is a bounds! Will order again.</li>
    <li> wonderful moisturizer</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because I used to sell Mary Kay and love it! However when I received it, it didn&#x27;t seem like it was a full container and there was no seal on it. I feel like it had been used before, but I&#x27;m stuck with it so I&#x27;ll just use it and choose another seller in the future.</li>
    <li> This is nice!  You don&#x27;t need much, and it works!  Thanks Amazon for making this product available.</li>
    <li> I love Mary Kay&#x27;s TimeWise Moisturizer.  I&#x27;ve been using this product a long time.  But, I&#x27;ve never been really happy with how long it takes for my representatives to order and bring it to me.  Buying it through Amazon cost less and I got it quicker.  It was the same great product I&#x27;ve been loving for years! Very pleased! I will definitely order this way next time too!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and product was as described.</li>
    <li> Fast, convenient and quality product at a fair price. I recommend this seller and product. Age defying results. Look at all of the top sellers pics in Mary Kay. All over 50 and no wrinkles !</li>
    <li> Loved it leaves my face clean, fresh and soft flawless.</li>
    <li> Good stuff for me !!!</li>
    <li> Like to use this under my makeup.</li>
    <li> Arrived in time. Great product. Great price.</li>
    <li> Have ordered several times and like it very much for it is not greasy, feel good on face, Have very good prices on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I bought this and was charged incorrectly</li>
    <li> This is an excellent moisturizer for combination skin. Moisturizes but is not too heavy. I have used this product for over 15 years.</li>
    <li> Cant live without.  Perfect for not only my skin, but my teenage daughters as well!</li>
    <li> I have been using this Timewise Age Fighting moisturizer for the last couple years,,,and I swear by it.  It really does keep skin younger looking and hydrated.  It absorbs quickly so you don&#x27;t have to wait around to put your makeup on.  I am a gramma.and everyone compliments my nice skin. Keeping those wrinkles away does make you look younger.  Even my 30 something daughter uses it and also loves it.</li>
    <li> I have dry sensitive skin and this really makes my face feel good.It goes on smoothly I like the fact that it comes in a tube</li>
    <li> I have dry skin and this moisturizer has made a huge difference in the look and feel of my skin.  I do have to apply it twice before applying my foundation but it is very concentrated so a little goes a long way.  I have used alot of things that have dried my skin out or made my reddness worse but this stuff has given me a nice even complexion :)</li>
    <li> I have used this product for some time now and I love how great it works on my skin, I will continue to use!!</li>
    <li> I love this product it&#x27;s real good for your skin</li>
    <li> Excellent, definitely for sensitive skin</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000GHGGKK Mary Kay TimeWise Age-Fighting Moisturizer (Normal/Dry Skin)]]I have to say I don&#x27;t like this product.  Will not purchase again.  Maybe I&#x27;m so used to the night cream, that I feel this just leaves your skin \\&quot;dry\\&quot;.  I will continue to use a touch of the night cream as a day time moisturizer under makeup.  (A very light touch only!)</li>
    <li> I have a few spots on my face that tend to be dry.  This moisturizer works fantastic.  Moisturizes without being greasy.  My face has also started looking a bit older than I actually am.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if this moisturizer would help but I figured this couldn&#x27;t hurt.  I was happy to see some improvement after using this for a couple weeks!  I&#x27;ll keep using it to see what it can do.</li>
    <li> Do NOT buy this product! you will get old product that doesn&#x27;t work. Selling Mary Kay on a website such as this is against Mary Kays policy and should be reported.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price</li>
    <li> Excellent  and fast service</li>
    <li> I Like the product but package was taped and appeared to have been opened and used</li>
    <li> fine product though I really prefer a heavier cream.  Jafra discontinued their line I have used for many yrs so I have switched and ZtimeWise seems to keep my face moisturized.  Shipping was quick.</li>
    <li> Could not be happier with my purchases; I&#x27;m so thankful that I am able to order Mary Kay products from Amazon as my Mary Kay lady passed and I don&#x27;t know another in my area. Plus Amazon is so convenient.</li>
    <li> My Skin Type: Oily, Medium/Light Tone, Breakouts Cheek and Jaw Line,     Hair Color: Dark Brown/Black    Eye Color: Green    Age: 22    Knowing the skin type, color of eyes, and hair will help some to better understand if the product is right for them.  Personally I experienced a smoother and more even skin texture.  \\&quot;Timewise\\&quot; is usually intended for those who are in need of anti-aging results, but I would say this product is for anyone who wants to achieve an airbrushed complexion even before applying your daytime look.  Get a nice glow by using this product!  I have used this mask for the past month now.  I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Needed some moisturizer and knowing Mary Kay products decided to give it a try.  Works well.</li>
    <li> I love the Mary Kay moisturizer, have been using it for over 5 yrs. i will contiue using my MaryKay Moisturize..It  has done a world of difference to my face. I am 59 yrs old, and my face has not one wrinkle...Thank you again.  So happy I got it through Amazon..  Janie Coffia   Mary Kay is not a fluke. I am almost 70 and I have been told that I am not 70 I do not look this age, well I am and can prove it,  As I saaid, I have been using it faithfully for over 5 yrs, when my daughter was a representative for Mary Kay.love it, jusy love it...</li>
    <li> Delivered on time. Products just as described online and authentic as if purchased from a Mary Kay consultant.</li>
    <li> Fast arrival time, great product</li>
    <li> I have been using this product over a year and i just love it. I use it everyday. I would recommend this product to everyone. I am happy i found out about MaryKay products when i did. I cant do without it.</li>
    <li> good product timely shipping</li>
    <li> at first...I  wasn&#x27;t sure about this product. That is why it took me awhile to write a review. I do that sometimes - I take my time. Amazon always sends me emails asking me to write a review. Sometimes it upsets me because they do not give me time to make sure I actually like that product before I  rush to write about it.  This product is very nice and hydrates my skin nicely. I noticed that if you add a little more and you go back and apply more  so the dry area is moist - it helps my breakouts. A lot! I am on my second order. So I like it!</li>
    <li> i have been using this moisturizer for 10 years and i love it! i have dry sensitive skin and this doesnt cause me to break out and it lasts all day long without becoming greasy. i recommend it to everyone!</li>
    <li> The package arrived on time and is one of my favorite products.</li>
    <li> Love Mary Kay products!</li>
    <li> THIS REALLY WORKS FOR ME</li>
    <li> This product is great.  I was nervous about ordering Mary Kay from Amazon but the product came nicely shipped and on time.  I love the lotion - I have a very dry face in the winter and this works great and doesn&#x27;t make my face greasy.</li>
    <li> Makes my old skin feel silky smooth!</li>
    <li> I have used this product in the past and it is well worth the money. The service was very fast.</li>
    <li> This product delivers exactly what it advertises. It&#x27;s also a great value for how much product you get. I would reccomend this to others.</li>
    <li> I love Mary Kay produtcts. It was delivered in a timely matter and the product was just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> The only moisturizer I will use-makeup goes on smooth.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and it keeps the face properly moisturized without a greasy feeling.  Highly recommended for men after shaving.  Keeps the skin looking young.  A great buy on Amazon compared with Mary Kay agents.</li>
    <li> I am 38 and have been using this for two years. I buy through Mary Kay. I notice a huge difference from when I put this on. My face has an instant glow. I get compliments of how young I look and don&#x27;t even wear makeup on the weekends. This could be from other factors such as genetics but I love the way the moisturizer feels and gives a glow to my face.</li>
    <li> Have used it previously &amp; it looks the same; however, I haven&#x27;t used this one yet, but it should work as well.  Appreciate the fast delivery service!</li>
    <li> Mary kay you are the best for my skin, I love you!</li>
    <li> Tried and true moisturizer. One of those products I don&#x27;t know how I lived without</li>
    <li> I have been using Mary Kay Timewise Age Fighting Moisturizing for about 6 months. This moisturizer delivers great coverage without being overly greasy.  After application my skin retains a glow and does not appear or feels dry.  I would definitely recommend the product.</li>
    <li> Have been using Mary Kay since 1976. Love it !!</li>
    <li> My mom has used this product for years and loves it.  We used to purchase it from our Mary Kay distributor but unfortunately she passed away.</li>
    <li> My favorite day cream. It is not greasy​ and provides good moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I love this product and have relied on it for daily facial care for a number of years.  I receive many compliments on my skin which I attribute in part to the Mary Kay products I have used for about 30 years.</li>
    <li> This review is on the product itself – not the actual amazon seller. I’ve been on Mary Kay for about 7 years now. I started my MK regime on the timewise normal/dry moisturizer feeling I had pretty “normal” skin. I liked it but felt my face was often left feeling greasy and looking shiny. I switched to the timewise combo/oily moisturizer and it worked perfectly, leaving my face hydrated but without a greasy look or feeling. I recommend this product for people with dry skin. If you feel you have oily skin at all, this product might induce the oiliness and you would be better off using the combination moisturizer. I pair the combo/oily moisturizer with the normal/dry cleanser and I love the outcome.</li>
    <li> I use Mary Kay all the time and I love it.  Makes my skin look and ƒeel ƒresh.  Try it.</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizer I have ever bought. I have very sensitive skin and usually can never put anything on my face. But after a hard winter my skin was so dry I needed to try something. In the past everything I used made me break out and have very oily, but with this product I had none of that , just smooth radiant skin.</li>
    <li> Have used this item for many years, my sister-in-law use to sell it to me but she is getting out, so I found it here and will continue to get it as long as I can.</li>
    <li> It was just what I wanted and arrived promptly.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS and will most definitely continue to use it and purchase more when needed. Leaves skin feel younger, looking younger and does not leave a film or greasy feeling. Great product.</li>
    <li> I wonder if all of the positive reviews are by MK sales reps.  I was looking for a good anti-aging moisturizer and I purchased this one because it was the highest rated on amazon.  I was so disappointed when I tried it. It is very liquid, instead of creamy and it did not feel particularly good on my skin.  But I tried it for a few weeks and I can honestly say that I saw no difference in my skin and, if anything, it worsened.  I am still searching for the perfect product...this is not it</li>
    <li> My wife really enjoys this product and Mary Kay has been a household product for years.  We do not have that Pink Caddy, but when she uses this moisturizer she says that she feels like a million bucks.  Don&#x27;t hesitate on this one it is just what the doctor ordered.</li>
    <li> I have previously used the Mary Kay TimeWise Age Fighting Moisturizer. Then a friend of mine recommend another product. I found that Mary Kay was far superior. I use a small amount daily. I love the feel and look of my skin.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer leaves my skin both smooth and supple without any greasy feeling. I highly recommend this product for anyone.</li>
    <li> Very quick! Happy with everything!</li>
    <li> I have used this Mary Kay item for years, and I was anticipating that this would be the same product, but it was NOT.  The packaging looked the same, but the moisturizer was thick and smelled exactly like some suntan lotion.  This was NOT Mary Kay- buyer beware!!!</li>
    <li> my mother uses this and loves it!</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer on the market.</li>
    <li> I really like this moisturizer! It really hydrates my skin, has a nice subtle feminine smell, and gives skin a nice radiant glow.</li>
    <li> Lightweight, never oily and makes my skin feel great!  i suggest you use this product morning and night for great results!</li>
    <li> Love this product &amp; have been using faithfully after a former neighbor turned me onto it. Keeps my skin feeling soft &amp; moisturized ALL day long.</li>
    <li> I LOVE MK products and was thrilled when I could find it on my favorite online store HOWEVER, I do NOT believe that what you are getting is from an actual MK representative. And if it is....well....I hope they don&#x27;t get caught by their directors!! The product felt and smelled a little old. My skin actually started to break out from use which has NEVER happened with any of the MK products I&#x27;ve gotten from my representative. It even burned a little which has most definitely NEVER happened with my other products. I will from now on purchase MK products from a representative and NOT from online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: WHEN THE PRODUCT IS FRESH&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizes skin&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling&lt;br /&gt;Quenches dry skin, leaving it smooth and soft&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s age fighting!! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;This product in particular was old&lt;br /&gt;My skin started to break out because of it, burned a little too&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not be purchasing MK products from this seller, only from my representative....</li>
    <li> Good product. Great price!</li>
    <li> Used this product before and I am well Pleased with it.</li>
    <li> I USE THIS AFTER CLEANSER TO PROTECT SKIN EXPOSED TO THE ELIMATES.  IT LEAVES SKIN SOFT, OIL FREE AND HELPS KEEP LINES DEVELOPING ON THE FACE.</li>
    <li> One reason that this product probably doesn&#x27;t work is because it is more than likely expired.  These products are not suposed to be sold on the internet just for that reason, you don&#x27;t know what you are getting.  If you buy from a Mary Kay consultant you will get a 100% guarantee, if you don&#x27;t like something for any reason you can get your money back or a replacement with something else.  Besides this takes away from the consultants trying to make a living.</li>
    <li> Fast service - love their moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used Mary Kay for many years, and thought I would give it a try!! I don&#x27;t know why I strayed!!</li>
    <li> I use the Mary Kay products because the wok with my skin. I&#x27;ve used them for over 40 years and even at 77 I still have soft moist skin on my face.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and find this moisturizer does not cause a breakout. It is also a nice weight - not too thick to use in warmer weather yet moisturizing enough for use in the colder months.</li>
    <li> Good daily moisturizer that you will want to make a part of your beauty routine!</li>
    <li> Great product and delivery time! Very well pleased!</li>
    <li> I love timewise products. The service was great. Thank you</li>
    <li> Have used this product for a couple months.  Not real impressed with it.  I prefer a thicker, more concentrated moisturizer as I have dry skin.  This one is very thin and more like a liquid.</li>
    <li> This product when applied is smooth. It has a nice feel and is a wonderful moisturizer. It makes my skin feel and look youthful.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product for those who are looking for a light moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This was a great price and great lotion. It is very mosturizing and helps with the fine lines. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Thin, runny product with absolutely no moisturizing effects whatsoever.  Big waste of time and a waste of money.  Lesson learned.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do as promised. Won&#x27;t buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer and it doesn&#x27;t make me break out like others can.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this moisturizer as it works for her.</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with the speed in which my request was responded to.I was delighted to be able to buy this product at a discount.</li>
    <li> I use this moisturizer everytime after washing my face.  I know it&#x27;s working, because after I wash my face with soap (I know, a no no!), it never feels tight or dry.  I think this moisturizer is penetrating deep in my skin even though it&#x27;s not a heavy cream, and giving me all the moisture I need.  No other &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; moisturizer does this.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of some of the reviews and I thought it would be good for a trip I was planning.  It was good - not great - but good.</li>
    <li> I have used this moisturizer for several years and have always liked it.  That is why I keep purchasing it.  At 63 my face has relatively few wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed and much quicker than my usual source</li>
    <li> I have used Mary Kaye for years and have always ordered from a rep. but since I live in the rural part of oklahoma it has become difficult to find a rep. for Mary Kaye.  I decided to go online at Amazon, one of my favorite places to shop and see if these products could be ordered.  Thankfully I was able to order these at a reasonable price and received them in just a few days.  No more looking for a rep for me!  Very satisfied!</li>
    <li> Lovin&#x27; this moisturizer! Not greasy at all and does a smooth job on my face and neck very nicely. It has made a difference on my not so young skin and given me a more youthful appearance. Mary Kay is the way!</li>
    <li> Mary Kay is the greatest. also fast delivery</li>
    <li> Light weight and moisturizing, I&#x27;ve been using it every night for almost a month and my skin feels very supple and looks more even. I will definitely repurchase.</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer for middle age skin that I have ever used.</li>
    <li> THis was sent to me very late.  I have to send seller and email 3 times. FINALLY it arrived.</li>
    <li> It works!!! my girlfriend lovers it and it got me some extra time out of relationship jail. Thanks Mary Kay!! I owe you</li>
    <li> always works well for my weird skin that tends to feel tight after washing my face. i like it alot</li>
    <li> I ordered this product 2 weeks before I actually needed it. I just checked the tracking and it was not shipped until one week after I ordered it and then not until I rated the product on Amazon complaining about how long it took to receive the product. This was a gift for my daughter that I needed by a certain date, and according to the tracking I will not receive it until a day late for her to get it as a gift. Never again...</li>
    <li> Been using this for many years and just love this moisturizer for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Only moisturizer I can use that doesn&#x27;t break my skin out. Love it, does not feel greasy!</li>
    <li> Have used Mary Kay for years.  And it works for me.</li>
    <li> The price is cheaper than if you was to purchase it from a representative. I use it after I put on serum and top it with spf.</li>
    <li> I am sure I will be pleased- just started using it !  I have heard too much about this product not to!</li>
    <li> Gift and she loved it</li>
    <li> Seller was excellent and had this to me fast....great product!</li>
    <li> I have used Mary Kay moisturizer for many years. I like it because it feels light on my skin but is also very effective.</li>
    <li> I use this product for years,love it!Amazon was great with the orders,delivery date,on time!What more can I say,Great!! No problems,none!!</li>
    <li> Love this also and the price</li>
    <li> very happy with my purchase, will order again soon. skin feels smooth and soft, wear it everyday and hope to continue using the product.</li>
    <li> Great love it will order ag</li>
    <li> mary kay makes the best cleanser and moisturizer in my opinion I love how it feels and how it soaks up never greasy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other facial moisturizers and none compare.  Relieves dry skin with no oily or sticky residue.  This purchase was simple and easy, and delivered very quickly.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 25 years...I just love it.  People tell me all the time that I look younger than what I am.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve  used it for years. I&#x27;ts a good product.</li>
    <li> I guess I have to use it very lightly because when I use it in the morning, my face is still oily at night. The packaging was horrible, the box looked like it had already been used, and I thought MK was a legit product sold on AMAZON. I guess they re-package it if it was returned? or it just expired, theres no date! which is sketchy. I want to return it, but I still haven&#x27;t tried it completely. I was really disappointed of the broken box taped in bubble wrap. :P</li>
    <li> This is a great Mary Kay product. Lightweight and non-greasy. Not a bad price when you consider how much some other moisturizers cost from Nordstrom&#x27;s or Macy&#x27;s. Never had a problem with irritation or break outs while using this and I do have sensitive skin. I highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that when I last ordered this from Amazon, the seller (3rd party, not Amazon) was a scam artist and sent me an empty package and continually refused to admit that she may have actually made a mistake by not sending the item. Maybe she never intended to send it, I&#x27;m not sure what her deal is. Imagine my surprise when I opened up a roughly taped up brown paper package that contained 2 pieces of styrofoam packaging and nothing else! I was ready to take it to the police department because I could not figure out why someone would mail me that. The return address was some man&#x27;s name in a city I didn&#x27;t know. I ended up dealing directly with a local Mary Kay representative and just paid full price for this item. My point is to be careful when dealing with 3rd party sellers of this product or any product if they do not have a stellar rating. It is NOT worth it to save a buck! I have bought MANY items through Amazon and Ebay over the years and never had this happen EVER. It could be a fluke, who knows. Lastly, beware of expired Mary Kay products also being sold as new. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Awesome.  Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love Mary Kay TimeWise age Fighting Moisturizer, and I received it in a timely manner. Thank You, Cathy Atcheson</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a number of years and recently tried the moisturizer with Sun screen and it burns my skin near my eyes so I am back to using this one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for several years and like what it does for my skin.  It only takes a small amount, once a day.</li>
    <li> Let me tell you a story. My boyfriend was graduating from graduation, so me and his parents were going to visit him for a couple days. He always said he loved how my skin always felt soft and clean, so i was really worried when my skin became dried and cracked before we left. Me skin is very forgiving, so i didn&#x27;t think twice when his mom offered me a sampler from her Mary Kay bag (which she was selling). She was dying to see how this particular moisturizer worked, since she always used a different kind. She gave me this moisturizer with the cleanser of the same kind. Before i went to bed that night i washed my face with the cleanser and then moisturized. In the morning, i basically went from my bed to the car, not really looking at my face. However, i noticed my face was bumpy and irritated. I thought that this was because my sin was still dry. Upon arriving at a hotel, I quickly realized that the bumps weren&#x27;t just dry patches of skin, but pimples.&lt;br /&gt;I NEVER BREAKOUT. I&#x27;ve never ever had more than two pimples at a time, so it was a huge surprise when i went from a clear complexion to a PIZZA FACE in just one night. I literally HAD MORE PIMPLES THAN SKIN. Luckily, my skin is very forgiving and i managed to get rib of them by soaking my face in every kind of facial cleanser known to man. NOT MARY KAY, oh no. never again.</li>
    <li> Just couple words: nothing special, at all. I have dry skin type ,so I thought it is going to be a good moisturizer. Not really:must reapplied this one almost every 3-4 hours/day and at least 2 times before bed time to keep my skin moist . Not good.&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy this one again? No.&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend it to somebody else? No.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for 23 years.  It is excellent</li>
    <li> Have been using this product fro over 30 years.  People who say this not a true Mary Kay product don&#x27;t know anything about MK at all.  Love it.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve used the product now for two years or more, makes my skin looks smooth. used other prodcts but did not have the same results.</li>
    <li> I have used Mary Kay for many, many years.  As usual, very happy with this product.  Quick ship and exactly what i needed.</li>
    <li> This is a good product for adding moisture to dry skin.  Mary Kay is a good way to go.  Will buy again</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive, dry skin and have tried various brands, including high-end department stores.  However, I always end up going back to Mary Kay.  It&#x27;s the best.  It&#x27;s light weight, gentle, and gets the job done!  Very pleased!</li>
    <li> One of the only two products during the winter that actually moisturizes my dry face and keeps it that way.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I am 64 and have  used this for several years and I get more compliments on my skin . It really works great. It is non greasy on your skin. I wear ir under my makeup every day and my skin looks great.</li>
    <li> Great product to apply to face each morning -- keeps face moist without being greasy.  Recommend to anyone approaching 40 and beyond.</li>
    <li> Very good pricing. Helps my face without being too greasy. Does not break me out or make my skin rough because I have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Mary Kay TimeWise Age Fighting Moisturizer is excellent. It goes on very smoothly, keeps the&lt;br /&gt;skin moist for a long time, and makes the skin more youthful looking.</li>
    <li> [...] Mary Kay backs their products with a 100% money back guarantee. I would not trust buying on amazon. It&#x27;s not custom skin care and no guessing whats in the mary kay bottles.</li>
    <li> Mary Kay moisturizer works very well for me.  It has really helped to keep the biggest lines off my face.</li>
    <li> Love Mary Kay products</li>
    <li> Excellent product and highly recommended by Good Housekeeping Magazine</li>
    <li> Received quickly. Exactly what I wanted at a good price.</li>
    <li> Hands down the best moisturizer for normal/combination skin!  Most moisturizers leave an oily/greasy film, and this is not the case with this product.  The product is readily absorbed into the skin, and makes your skin feel soft and dewy.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year, and am very pleased with the results.  I typically go for &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products, but this is one product that I make an exception for.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer. Helps my face because if you get the right one (depending if your skin is oily or dry) it will help. I don&#x27;t have any problems with this product. My face hasn&#x27;t been itchy or dry. It complements the face wash quite well.</li>
    <li> Very good product by Mary Kay. I bought this as a gift for an aunt. I can tell she&#x27;s very happy with the product. She loves Mary Kay and states that all her products are of the highest quality. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed this product for years, thank you very much. My husband bought this for me as a gift and asks me to say he likes to kiss my face.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is the best I&#x27;ve ever used - now for many years.  More expensive than a few years ago, when the container was larger (and it was a bottle rather than a tube).  My only wish to Mary Kay produce managers would be that a larger size also be made available at a lower price per ounce, and again in a bottle.</li>
    <li> This product was what was sold 5 years ago according to the packaging and was only 2/3 full.</li>
    <li> I wanted a Mary Kay moisturizer &amp; it works.</li>
    <li> Have used Mary Kay for many years.</li>
    <li> I use this under my foundation and/or concealer whenever I wear make up.  It&#x27;s lightweight, and it does the job perfectly.  It never irritates my skin, which is a worry of mine when choosing moisturizers.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year, and I can&#x27;t really say whether there&#x27;s any age-fighting going on.  I didn&#x27;t buy it for that reason, but a Mary Kay consultant recommended using it when you&#x27;re in your late 20&#x27;s/early 30s.  I would definitely recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Mary Kay products for about 20 years. I have sensitive skin, and this is one of the few products that doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to breakout.</li>
    <li> Creamy and light weight for application.  Takes only a small amount to provide the moisture my skin needs. Skin looks more alive.</li>
    <li> The best age fighting moisturizer. Works on all ages. It is not greasy or  sticky. It also helps your foundation to last longer.</li>
    <li> This 5 star for a moisturizer is a first for me. Being a moisturizer junkie that says an awful lot about this product. I have mature very dry skin. After one week of use I have men asking me how old I am. I seriously think it has taken 10 years off my face!</li>
    <li> For me and my combo/acne-prone skin, this lotion rocks at lightweight moisture but doesn&#x27;t quite do the trick on its own when it comes to dry/flaky patches. My simple solution? I add in a drop of jojoba oil! It amps up the moisturizing power without turning my skin into an oil slick :)</li>
    <li> great product works great just like the same stuff I was getting from Mary Kay but a lots better price.</li>
    <li> With my skin allergies the only moisturizer I can use. It works so well for me. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I was expecting.  It was delivered very quickly!! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I have been using Mary Kay products for years. The moisturizer is a life saver and skin saver in the cold Ohio Weather.. Buying through amazon is convenient.The delivery date was earlier than expected which is always a plus.</li>
    <li> Great product just order more I love it make skin smooth and look refresh use every morn and glow all day</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer.  I use it at night and it keeps my skin feeling moisturized without being greasy or oily feeling like some others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Have always loved this product</li>
    <li> Just as I expected it to be</li>
    <li> Item was as described and arrived promptly</li>
    <li> The product was still in the shrink wrap, inside the box.  It was exactly the same product I&#x27;ve purchased many times from a Mary Kay Representative.  It was less expensive and you didn&#x27;t have to be at home for your &amp;#34;MK Consultant&amp;#34; to bring it to your personally and tell you about other products you may need. It was in my mailbox waiting on me when I got home.  I will definitely purchase this again, and again!</li>
    <li> works fine for age fighting</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer! It was originally given to me as a sample and I had never used Mary Kay products before. It is light enough to wear under my makeup and absorbs quickly. I&#x27;m only 26 so I only had laugh lines and just a few fine lines starting near my eyes and all of those have almost completely vanished. I can see a difference in my face. I don&#x27;t think I will ever buy another moisturizer other than this one.</li>
    <li> I used to use the Mary Kay moisturizer 2, but when I couldn&#x27;t find anywhere to get that anymore I purchased this. I was dissapointed with this in comparison. It leaves my face feeling tacky an doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb all of the way. When I go to wash my face hours later, the remainder washes off. I find that is seems rather thick and makes my skin more oily.</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer, not greasy</li>
    <li> Light but effective, no oil so even i can use it with oily skin when we get the santa ana winds and really dry air. Improves your skin texture over time. At least it did mine.</li>
    <li> I love this product. The best moisturizer ever!!!</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer ever</li>
    <li> i was very happy with this product. it is just what i ordered.  Have used it before and this product was the same.</li>
    <li> I have used this moisturizer for a while and love it.. but boy, oh boy will I never purchase from this seller or on Amazon again!  It is not really Mary Kay.  It has a funny odor to it that the other lotion I had did not....  UGH!  Worst part is that I already threw the box away and can&#x27;t return</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s cheaper here than for Mary Kay, it&#x27;s the same product</li>
    <li> I like the way, you don&#x27;t have to use a lot of this product for it to be effective daily.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll never buy Timewise from a Mary Kay representative again. I&#x27;ve used Timewise for 12 years and paid full price until I saw it on Amazon. I was leery that it wouldn&#x27;t  be the same, in my opinion it is the same as one buys through a Mary Kay representative. I love it!</li>
    <li> I have used the cream for many years and I am pleased with its results. A must have for me</li>
    <li> i am a MK consultant and usually buy from myself but my order was lost and I had to get this right away. it arrived very quickly</li>
    <li> I have used the Timewise moisturizer for many years.  I was surprised and lucky to find in on Amazon!  If you have dry skin but don&#x27;t want that greasy feel this is the product for you!  I wear it year around and under makeup.  The price was right!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product and I use a Mary Kay&lt;br /&gt;moisturerizer daily but this is my favorite one.&lt;br /&gt;It was delivered in a couple of days. Thank You</li>
    <li> I am pleased with my order.  Thank you for prompt shipment.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used MK products for almost 10 years, and won&#x27;t use anything else.  I&#x27;ve tried other brands, but keep coming back to MK.</li>
    <li> Got here quick. It was for my mom and she loved it. MK is all she uses! Thank a bunch!</li>
    <li> I love this product and have been using it for years.  I have found a lot of cremes I&#x27;ve tried have irritated my eyes and this creme has never done that and it does a great job of moisturizing my skin.</li>
    <li> Always happy with Mary Kay moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Package came undamaged and in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> A++ everything as ordered</li>
    <li> My face used to get so dry in winter that it would actually be flaky!  With this moisturizer it stays moist and supple.</li>
    <li> This is a true to earth product. Takes very little. Is not greasy. Does exaXtly what it says it will.do. Last a very long time. Absorbs&lt;br /&gt;into the skin instantiy</li>
    <li> I have only tried it a couple of times but notice my friend&#x27;s face (who uses it) does not look all that great, I notice alot of lines on her, but, she says she likes it.</li>
    <li> I have been using Mary Kay products for 40 years.  I get many compliments on how fresh and smooth my skin looks for a woman of my age.  In fact some people are amazed to find out just how old I am.</li>
    <li> Love the time wise for it makes my skin feel fresh &amp; clean!</li>
    <li> it works well on my skin</li>
    <li> I use this moisturizer every day.  I love it!!  Makes my skin feel smooth and helps my foundation go on smoother.</li>
    <li> I have used this moisturizer for years and LOVE it!</li>
    <li> I thought this was just okay; better than using nothing.  I really didn&#x27;t see much improvement in my skin.  I love the ANEW products as far as making a visible difference, so I&#x27;ll probably stick to those.</li>
    <li> Great product and seller!</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer! Everybody should try it!</li>
    <li> Words cannot describe how much I love this face cream! Every now and then you come across a product that becomes YOUR tried and true go-to product, and this is that for me. I started using it a few months ago and I now use nothing else. It is light and rich, giving your face much needed moisture without making it oily which is very important for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, get this product. It&#x27;s awesome.</li>
    <li> I totally love this lightweight ,moisturizer &amp; what it does for my skin.  My skin feels much softer &amp; smoother.  :-)</li>
    <li> I have used Mary Kay Time-Wise products for 13 years and my skin looks and feels great. Even at a recent dermatology appointment the doctor commented on how good my skin looked for my age. I think these products have played a major part in that.</li>
    <li> One of the best moisturizers I&#x27;ve used. Love the feel on my face, it is like having nothing on at all, it&#x27;s not heavy and makes my skin feel smoother and softer.</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer I have found</li>
    <li> Love Mary Kay products. Gentle and agreeable with my skin. Tried others and caused my skin to break out. This is safe and I have used it for over ten years.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with seller, too. Prompt and great packaging. Will purchase from again.</li>
    <li> This was for my client who is 87 years old, she has been using this moisturizer for as long as I&#x27;ve known her which is years! She says this is the best fit for her face &amp; uses it as a part of her regular routine morning &amp; night, she simply loves it.</li>
    <li> My order was delivered as stated. The product came as it said and is exactly what I wanted. The Moisturizer was not out of date and very creamy like all the others I have ordered from a consultant. I like it, the only thing was it does not have SPF for the sun.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a moisturizer in the Timewise line. This was a great price.  I am trying it for the first time.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t compare to Formula #1</li>
    <li> Have used  Mary Kay for years. I have tried other products from time to time, but always come back.  Only negative is finding a MaryKay consultant that doesn&#x27;t give up.  Thus, was ecstatic to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 30 years and it is still a great moisturizer. I love all Mary Kay products.</li>
    <li> The product came on time and was what it was supposed to be.  Even though I paid shipping, it was still cheaper than full price.  Satisfied customer!</li>
    <li> Love the feel of this Mary Kay moisturizer....not to thick or greasy.  Use it over my Day Solution by MK.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, perfect price! If you have normal/dry skin you must make this product a part of your make-up essentials.</li>
    <li> I am really enjoying my conair dryer</li>
    <li> I have been using this moisturizer for over a year now.  I purchased this for my daughter who lives in another state. The shipping was free and I wanted her to try it.  She loves it too!  It is non greasy and makes your skin look and feel beautiful.  I also have sensitive skin and this product does not irritate it.</li>
    <li> I really like this item and will purchase again.  Would recommend&lt;br /&gt;to anyone, and have suggested to others for use.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and is just what I needed.</li>
    <li> I have used the moisturizer for years and give it 5 stars!</li>
    <li> I will use outdated product, which is what I received.  The bottle that came to me was not the one pictured, but the old white bottle with the pink top.  I believe the change over took place a few years ago.  I am not going to return my prduct, but be aware that you are not getting what is picured.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and Mary Kay, like the Lone Ranger, has come to my rescue.  Great product - wouldn&#x27;t want to be without it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Mary Kay Moisturizer Cream for awhile and like it very much.  After applying it your skin feels so soft and silky.</li>
