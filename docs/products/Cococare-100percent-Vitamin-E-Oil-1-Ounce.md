    <li> Just what I needed. Thank goodness it is sold on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Very thick, one bottles cap was broken</li>
    <li> Vitamin E has always been a staple in my house. I remember my mom used it on her face and she was constantly complimented on how young/Beautiful she was. The Vitamin E is pure and goes on smooth. Very happy! This product was delivered when promised.  Will definitely be doing business again.</li>
    <li> This Vitamin E oil is wonderful. I love that it comes in a glass bottle and that it is just vitamin e without any added fillers. I bought this for at home DIY skincare and hygiene recipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: it is very hard to gauge how many drops you are getting out of the bottle. The oil is rather gooey and there is no drip spout cap on it. So it just pours out and you have to guesstimate. My chap-stick recipe called for 5 drops. I imagine if I added a bit too much it cant be that bad. My lips will just be extra moist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro: When I am done with this oil (which probably wont be for awhile) I plan on reusing the bottles!!! Oh the possibilities:)</li>
    <li> couldn&#x27;t fine this product locally, so i turned to Amazon.  excellent product.</li>
    <li> I feel this was a great deal. I use the oil in. My product line</li>
    <li> It is super sticky which isn&#x27;t something I like but it does help moisturize well</li>
    <li> Very good product.  This product is straight vitamin E where as virtually everything else is a mixture of other oils. I like the glass bottles.</li>
    <li> This is the second time i bought this Vitamin E Oil. My son has growth stretch marks on his back and this oil really helps make them almost disappear. I am very happy with the product, The shipping was fast and the package was carefully wrapped,</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! Best thing I have found to fill in lines and wrinkles. It improves overall appearance of my skin. It also has helped fade acne scars. I have spent hundreds on expensive creams, with little or no results.  I have skin issues and easily break out. This does not make my skin break out. It is very thick and greasy, so I use it at night before bed. It doesn&#x27;t stain my sheets or clothes. My 13 year old son has acne and had very bad scarring from it. He also uses this at night. He has very minimal scars left on his face. This is an excellent product for anyone with scarring to lines and wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Hard to find elsewhere…perfect!</li>
    <li> Pretty sticky. I cannot use this on my face then go to bed</li>
    <li> Just what I expected.  Works great for my homemade items.</li>
    <li> excellent quality oil.  very dense (comes out slow, thick viscosity).</li>
    <li> I mix it with my body lotion and it really moisture my skin ..When my sister used it she has some irritation on her skin !</li>
    <li> This product turns out to be synthetic.  It it sticky and thick, so much so I could barely get it out of the bottle.  I will pass thank you.  I prefer this product:    [[ASIN:B00NH70RBU Vitamin E Oil by GreatFull Skin Is a 100% All Natural and Premium All Purpose Liquid Serum Ointment - Best Emollient to Hydrate and Nourish Face, Skin, Hair, and Nails - Heal Scar Tissue - Beneficial for Baby Skin, Stretch Marks, Sunburn, Anti Aging, Wr...]]</li>
    <li> I pour this over my dog&#x27;s food once per day - it has improved his dry skin.</li>
    <li> It is exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality Vitamin E Oil. I add this to my homemade creams and things and I have also been using this daily on my sons scar that he got on his face. It has healed so well and looks amazing! You can&#x27;t even tell that a few months ago he had a big scar and stitches!</li>
    <li> its is only vitamin E but would have preferred if it was plant based.</li>
