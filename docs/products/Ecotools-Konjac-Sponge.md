      <li>I loved this sponge.  </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s good.</li>
      <li>I will say that when the product is taken care of correctly, it lasts for a good amount of time.</li>
      <li>but it feels SO good on your face.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice idea and good quality, but not for me.</li>

      <li>Seriously love everything from eco tools!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>Love this!</li>
      <li>and my skin even had a kind of glow.</li>
      <li>I honestly thought this was one of those sponges you use to blend in your foundation.</li>
      <li>It fits nicely in my hand too.  </li>
      <li>While that works great for removing surface dirt and makeup, I was impressed by how different my skin felt after using this Ecotools sponge.</li>
      <li>Takes up liquid soap nicely and wrings out</li>
      <li>I found that it needed a lot of rinsing after I used it, though, and it took a longer than I would have liked.  </li>

      <li>Interesting concept,</li>
      <li>My wife has been enjoying this brush.</li>
      <li>think I like it better than my prosonic.  </li>
      <li>Best of all, the sponge rinsed cleanly--NOTHING was left behind!&lt;br</li>
      <li>It did not inflame my rosacea and I was even able to use this after a peel.  </li>

      <li>Just okay.  </li>
      <li>I was pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>I really enjoyed being able to easily get into all the contours of my face, around and over my nose, into the eye sockets with this silky, egg-shaped sponge.  </li>
      <li>My skin feels very clean.</li>
      <li>so I stopped, but this would probably work great for people with normal skin who can scrub their faces with rags and have no problems.</li>
      <li>This is really great for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Great for sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>The day after using it, my makeup seemed to go on so much more smoothly</li>
      <li>Its easy to hold</li>
      <li>they fall apart easily.  </li>
      <li>I liked this product at first for the reason that it did smooth out my bumpy skin on my cheeks.</li>
      <li>If you insist on using a sponge on your face, this would be a fine one to choose.</li>
      <li>it softens fine, though has a somewhat gelatinous feel.</li>
      <li>It works just fine.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t take many days to turn sluggish, dry-looking skin into dewy, fresh skin - particularly if you follow every cleansing with a good moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>Add water and it takes on a gentle but effective texture.</li>
      <li>It has held up great after a month of daily use.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin, and the all natural fibers in this sponge are perfect for me.</li>
      <li>It gets so soft, in fact, that if you really want a good scrub you might be better off with a wash cloth.  </li>
      <li>Before this sponge, I never used anything except a washcloth to clean my face.</li>
      <li>Great for those of us with dry, non-sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I do not use washcloths when I clean my face</li>
      <li>The egg-like shape allows you to gently clean away dirt, oil, and makeup anywhere on the face and neckline with ease.  </li>
      <li>It is so gentle and smooth and feels refreshing on my face.  </li>
      <li>The shape is like a beauty blender and allows you to clean around your nose.  </li>
      <li>These Konjac sponges are a wonderful way to cleanse and soften the skin without scrubbing too hard.</li>
      <li>/&gt;CONS: While I can imagine the additional friction of this sponge is better than using your hands alone, I didn’t feel as though it was that much of an improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>There are so many things out there promising to give you results.  </li>
      <li>so it doesn&#x27;t take much to break me out :)</li>
      <li>Sure, it&#x27;s a gentle, exfoliating sponge.</li>
      <li>Yes, it is made out of natural ingredients, which is nice.</li>
      <li>True, this comes out of the box with the appearance of a styrofoam brick.</li>
      <li>The sponge does a good job of washing and removing facial cleanser.</li>
      <li>Not bad but</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s soo fun to clean out!&lt;br /&gt;•Gentle on skin, but does a good exfoliation job for daily use.</li>
      <li>Would purchase again to use with mild cleansers and soap.</li>
      <li>This is the perfect facial &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; for daily cleaning.  </li>
      <li>I have used several Konjac sponges and they are great at being a gentle face sponge, it has one flaw though, it does not have a hanging cord to hang it between uses.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an excellent gentle exfoliator for everyday use.  </li>
      <li>I suppose that those with a high eco-consciousness might find that appealing, I am indifferent,.</li>
      <li>So, you could spend $5.99 on this sponge for your face, or you could use a washcloth, which you probably already own, for free, for exactly the same results.</li>
      <li>It is not abrasive and glides easily with or without your favorite facial cleanser.</li>
      <li>When you wet this and get it sudsy with cleanser, it feels SO good on your skin, yet does an adequate job of exfoliating.</li>
      <li>great little sponge for cleaning.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good exfoliator and makes your skin ready for whatever cream/oil/moisturizer you will be applying next.</li>
      <li>/&gt;*I recieved this item complimentary for testing/review purposes via</li>
      <li>Definitely worth a whirl if you are looking for something to exfoliate.</li>
      <li>The sponge dries out pretty quickly.</li>
      <li>This sponge is a great (and easy) way to exfoliate - and it is soft enough for sensitive, aging skin.  </li>
      <li>either so being able to use only about a third of what I had previously used is wonderful.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is also great for taking off a facial mask or heavier facial cleansing products.</li>
      <li>first.</li>
      <li>I prefer a washcloth or nothing at all with my favorite facial cleanser.</li>
      <li>it’s mostly organic matter by the end of the second month</li>
      <li>I prefer to use Ecotools&#x27; other sponges, actually, because they feel a bit more durable and seem to clean my skin more thoroughly.</li>
      <li>It is everything they say it is: Natural, gentle, fragrance free.</li>
      <li>It leaves my skin feeling so soft and clean.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s smooth and soft and makes my face feel so much cleaner than washing with my hands alone.</li>
      <li>I love the size and shape, easy to use &amp; small to pack for travel.</li>
      <li>It will be interesting to see just how long it lasts, but overall I think it&#x27;s a good product for someone with sensitive skin who wants to get it thoroughly clean and feel pampered at the same time.</li>
      <li>First time users of Konjac sponges have to be aware that you do not need to use a lot of cleansing product to clean with the sponge; it is harder to clean out the cleansing agent and</li>
      <li>With a little cleanser (NOT makeup remover), I was able to clean EVERYTHING on my fact, something I can do well with cleanser alone.  </li>
      <li>skin felt clean and fine after--no stinging or other signs of irritation.</li>
      <li>It took more than 24hrs to fully dry</li>
      <li>and I mostly use sponges in the winter to exfoliate because I tend to get dry patches.</li>
      <li>it is super hard and doesn&#x27;t seem like it would be good for sensitive skin-</li>
      <li>This product works fine, but fell a bit short of what I was hoping to find.</li>
      <li>Like I said, I&#x27;ve used it and it works fine, but I don&#x27;t plan to purchase it again in the future.</li>
      <li>This face sponge is like washing your face with a very high quality washcloth.</li>
      <li>When I first took it out of the package I couldn&#x27;t believe it could ever get soft, but with water it did, and very much so.  </li>
      <li>really lathers soap up.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have used other konjac-sponges (there is one brand that comes with black clay infused and red clay infused variety that I get from the local Whole Foods) and for some reason I expected this to be inferior.  But it wasn&#x27;t. It literally did the same exact job and proved to me once and for all that the &#x27;clay infused&#x27;-stuff is just a gimmick. Do your wallet a favor and just get the plain one (unless they&#x27;re all the same price, the go wild!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m kind of addicted to these now and don&#x27;t feel like my face-cleaning session is complete until I soak one in hot water and rub it across my face. It&#x27;s a good exfoliator and makes your skin ready for whatever cream/oil/moisturizer you will be applying next.</li>
    <li> It is the best one for me</li>
    <li> Just ok , take a long time to dry</li>
    <li> There are quite a few brands of konjac sponges and I have tried from some of them. I would say by far this Ecotools one is my least favorite, especially for its smaller size. Sure, the price is a little bit cheaper but you are also getting a much smaller sponge. I find it hard to use. I would rather go with some of the other brands.</li>
    <li> This product works fine, but fell a bit short of what I was hoping to find. I like that it is made of a natural product, but it felt too soft to me once it was wet. I prefer to use Ecotools&#x27; other sponges, actually, because they feel a bit more durable and seem to clean my skin more thoroughly. About a month in, I think my Konjac sponge is starting to disintegrate a bit. Like I said, I&#x27;ve used it and it works fine, but I don&#x27;t plan to purchase it again in the future.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s texture is slightly rough but still spongy, just the right combination for this sort of thing.  It soaks up water easily, and it is the right size to hold for small hands.  Takes up liquid soap nicely and wrings out fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first. the material appears to be fragile.  But I&#x27;ve been using this for several weeks, and it shows no signs of tearing at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the small price.</li>
    <li> At first it&#x27;s surprising hard and rough, but once wet it&#x27;s very gentle even for sensitive skin. It Effectively helped remove more of my makeup without having to scrub.  It took more than 24hrs to fully dry and I&#x27;d rather not have a wet sponge lying around for that long everyday for a month.  It&#x27;s a nice idea and good quality, but not for me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a sponge. It comes out of the package feeling like a hard piece of styrofoam, and when it gets wet, it becomes soft and pliable. It is not harsh -- you would have to scrub very, very hard to damage your skin. That&#x27;s good. If you insist on using a sponge on your face, this would be a fine one to choose. But why use one at all? It will get bacteria trapped in it; it will drip on your bathroom counter while it&#x27;s drying; and bottom line, you don&#x27;t need it.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t anything special, it is your typical sponge. Except that it is made out of natural ingredients.... Straight out of the box it is super hard and doesn&#x27;t seem like it would be good for sensitive skin- but when you wet it, it gets mushy and soft. Dry it out and it becomes hard again. It isn&#x27;t rough on the skin at all.  I guess I&#x27;m just not sure this product is necessary. I prefer a washcloth or nothing at all with my favorite facial cleanser.</li>
    <li> Before this sponge, I never used anything except a washcloth to clean my face. While that works great for removing surface dirt and makeup, I was impressed by how different my skin felt after using this Ecotools sponge. It felt so much cleaner, and it wasn&#x27;t harsh or abrasive at all. The day after using it, my makeup seemed to go on so much more smoothly and my skin even had a kind of glow. I&#x27;m not sure how long the sponge will last, but at this point I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> Upon first look this sponge looks wrong. Add water and it takes on a gentle but effective texture. I&#x27;m really enjoying using this with my favorite Pangea Organics face wash. And I see a subtle difference in the texture of the skin on my face and neck.</li>
    <li> Love this! I have sensitive skin and I just can&#x27;t bring myself to use a electronic scrubber live a clarisonic or the Olay version. This costs dramatically less and cleans so well and takes care of the dry skin!</li>
    <li> These Konjac sponges are a wonderful way to cleanse and soften the skin without scrubbing too hard. I love how soft and squishy they feel once they&#x27;re moistened long enough. They grip my cleanser well, so there&#x27;s little to no waste! My only complaint is that they wear out very quickly (they say to replace once a month, but mine seem to dry out badly and start tearing after about 2 weeks)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t even fault them too badly for the drying out - simply because, at the end of the day, it&#x27;s a sponge!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely cost-friendly enough for you to give a try! I haven&#x27;t had a single problem with the Sensitive Skin Konjac Sponge, and I&#x27;ve got Rosacea so it doesn&#x27;t take much to break me out :)</li>
    <li> I would have never thought the rock of styrofoam in the package would soften to be such a luxurious facial sponge. Once wet it softens fine, though has a somewhat gelatinous feel. It&#x27;s a bit small and rounded, which is odd in a facial sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t find it abrasive at all, even considering that I use baking soda mixed in with my face cleanser. The sponge does a good job of washing and removing facial cleanser. To that end, it took a lot of rinsing to get all of the wash out, and I&#x27;m not sure that it did. I was a bit concerned about it not seeming thoroughly rinsed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin felt clean and fine after--no stinging or other signs of irritation. The product designer says the sponge is 100% natural, though I&#x27;m dubious of such claims. A lot of things are natural that aren&#x27;t necessarily good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m curious to see how well it holds up over time. The description says to replace it every 1-3 months, which is on par with other facial sponges. Whether I would get this one again, I&#x27;m unsure.</li>
    <li> I hate to admit it but when I opened the box and felt the hard sponge, shrink-wrapped in plastic, looking like a small white rock, I thought no way am I putting this on my sensitive skin. But I was so wrong, it&#x27;s great. As soon as you wet it the vegetable fiber softens and feels amazingly gentle on your face. It is everything they say it is: Natural, gentle, fragrance free. Definitely a keeper.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect facial &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; for daily cleaning.  It deep cleans without harshness.  I love the size and shape, easy to use &amp; small to pack for travel.</li>
    <li> If I had seen this in the store I *NEVER* would have purchased it, because it looks and feels so rough. But, when you wet it, it softens into a very gentle scrubber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually like this product, as a very gentle alternative to using my Clarisonic. When you wet this and get it sudsy with cleanser, it feels SO good on your skin, yet does an adequate job of exfoliating. It did not inflame my rosacea and I was even able to use this after a peel.  Very nice.</li>
    <li> When I first took it out of the package I couldn&#x27;t believe it could ever get soft, but with water it did, and very much so.  I really enjoyed being able to easily get into all the contours of my face, around and over my nose, into the eye sockets with this silky, egg-shaped sponge.  It&#x27;s so soft I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to wash a baby&#x27;s skin with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw that several people said it didn&#x27;t exfoliate.  I didn&#x27;t see anything that said it was supposed to.  I found that it needed a lot of rinsing after I used it, though, and it took a longer than I would have liked.  I would recommend using a liquid soap with it rather than a bar because if you don&#x27;t get all the bar soap out it forms a hard film over the surface of the sponge that takes some work to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased that for such a soft sponge it holds its shape well.  It will be interesting to see just how long it lasts, but overall I think it&#x27;s a good product for someone with sensitive skin who wants to get it thoroughly clean and feel pampered at the same time.</li>
    <li> I loved this sponge.  It has just enough grittiness on it to remove dead skin.  My skin feels softer and less coarse after using this.  I usually just use my facial cleaning gel and my face feels clean.  I started using this sponge after lathering my face, and what a difference if makes.  Its easy to hold and there&#x27;s a little indent on the flat side that makes it easier to clean your nose and chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I like it better than my prosonic.  No need to recharge this just buy a new one.</li>
    <li> great little sponge for cleaning. really lathers soap up. this one is very soft, i&#x27;m used to using an exfoliating washcloth to remove my face makeup so it felt a little weird for me to use it, but it seems to clean my face pretty well. i&#x27;m going to try the deep clean one next to compare. i will definitely repurchase this.</li>
    <li> So, you could spend $5.99 on this sponge for your face, or you could use a washcloth, which you probably already own, for free, for exactly the same results.</li>
    <li> True, this comes out of the box with the appearance of a styrofoam brick. And yes, the nearly $6 price tag is not wallet-friendly.  However, the product itself does become soft and pliable with water.  The egg-like shape allows you to gently clean away dirt, oil, and makeup anywhere on the face and neckline with ease.  It was gentle enough not to irritate my skin and my skin felt smoother and healthier after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also great for taking off a facial mask or heavier facial cleansing products. If you&#x27;re looking for a little bit of pampering and need a sensitive skin-friendly product, this is a nice sponge.</li>
    <li> My wife has been enjoying this brush. It works well on her face and she has only one complain, if you can even call it that. There&#x27;s a spongy core at the center of this brush that makes it hard to tell if soap residue has accumulated inside or if that&#x27;s just how it was made.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used two similar items (BuffPuff and a facial loofah) and I prefer this because (1) it keeps its shape well and (2) it isn’t too harsh which is my biggest complaint about other options. I do not use washcloths when I clean my face and I mostly use sponges in the winter to exfoliate because I tend to get dry patches. This feels like a luxurious washcloth without the mess of a washcloth (which is the main reason I don&#x27;t use them), and it is very effective at exfoliation without feeling like it is scrubbing your skin off and leaving it red and raw. Definitely worth a whirl if you are looking for something to exfoliate.</li>
    <li> This sponge is great!  It is so gentle and smooth and feels refreshing on my face.  In the few short days I have been using it, I have noticed less irritation to my face and a more even complexion.  I have a long way to go to get to clear skin, but this sponge will be necessary for my future skincare regiment.</li>
    <li> This Konjac facial sponge works much better than a natural hair brush for my face. I can see and feel the difference in using it. It is not abrasive and glides easily with or without your favorite facial cleanser. This is a keeper.</li>
    <li> Cleans well but isn&#x27;t harsh and doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin. Fits nicely in your hand and feels good. You only need a little of your face wash to get a really good, sudsy wash, so it can also help save you money when compared to other sponges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE WITH SENSITIVE SKIN</li>
    <li> I liked this product at first for the reason that it did smooth out my bumpy skin on my cheeks. However, after using it for a couple of weeks I noticed that the pores around the bridge of my nose got really big and are very noticeable. I have very sensitive skin so I am wondering if maybe this product was still too rough for me and actually caused damage to my pores. I stopped using this well over two months ago and the pores are still enlarged. I will say that when the product is taken care of correctly, it lasts for a good amount of time. At least mine did.</li>
    <li> My skin feels very clean.</li>
    <li> Essentially, this is just another product that will clutter up the bathroom. It&#x27;s a sponge. It&#x27;s a sponge that comes hard as a rock and becomes remarkably soft after adding water. But it&#x27;s so soft that it is of no use as an exfoliator. I could go to Wal-Mart and spend $2 for the same product, but I wouldn&#x27;t. I need a sponge to remove makeup and dirt from my face.</li>
    <li> It is sad to say, but this sponge is nothing special. Yes, it is made out of natural ingredients, which is nice. But other than that, it is really just another sponge. I have used it a few times and the results are ok. I don&#x27;t think it would be my go to however to use with my facial products. Just make sure you soak in water a few minutes before using.</li>
    <li> I was afraid of this at first because it felt like a hard pumice stone in the package and I thought it would be to abrasive. What a surprise when you wet it! The texture changes to almost a gel with a squishy feel yet it has a very subtle exfoliating texture. A very curious product but it feels SO good on your face. I love this with Nutrogena foaming facial cleanser, it leaves your skin polished and new feeling but not dry or red like some scrubbers leave your skin. This is a wonderful product, you must try it!</li>
    <li> In the box, the sponge looks and feels like Styrofoam. Once wet it softens up to become mushy feeling. When it dries, it becomes hard again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: The box promises gentle cleansing. I can believe this since the sponge is not at all abrasive. It’s made with natural ingredients. It’s fragrance and colorant free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: While I can imagine the additional friction of this sponge is better than using your hands alone, I didn’t feel as though it was that much of an improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using it makes me feel like I’m washing my face with water. When you squeeze it, you see lots of soap, but none of it shows up on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don’t have sensitive skin, but after using this, I had a couple of breakouts. I was using a gentle cleanser that I have used in the past and never had issues with before. I only used the sponge once a day and I wore no makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 STARS: I’m not convinced that this is a necessary product.</li>
    <li> The sponge is weird at first because when you take it out of the package it feels hard, almost like a pumice stone. Then you get it wet and it becomes this soft, squishy little cloud in your hand. Using it with your daily cleanser is supposed to reveal smooth, refreshed skin. I love it! I have sensitive skin, and the all natural fibers in this sponge are perfect for me. It leaves my skin feeling so soft and clean. My face looks smoother and happier since i&#x27;ve started using it.</li>
    <li> Did not notice a difference</li>
    <li> I buy a new one every month. This is really great for sensitive skin. I use it every morning in the shower with sensitive skin soap. I adore it and have it on subscription now.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m a sucker and had to try a konjac sponge for myself since they were being talked about all over the internet. I have super-, uber-, extra-, ultra-sensitive skin so rubbing this sponge on my face, even delicately, was a little much for me. Made my rosacea flare up a bit after using it for 3 nights so I stopped, but this would probably work great for people with normal skin who can scrub their faces with rags and have no problems.</li>
    <li> I have used several Konjac sponges and they are great at being a gentle face sponge, it has one flaw though, it does not have a hanging cord to hang it between uses.  The other sponges I have used hang by a cord when not in use to keep it dry.  The shape is like a beauty blender and allows you to clean around your nose.  First time users of Konjac sponges have to be aware that you do not need to use a lot of cleansing product to clean with the sponge; it is harder to clean out the cleansing agent and if you do not it will leave a hard film on your sponge.  It is definitely advisable to change your sponge every two months it’s mostly organic matter by the end of the second month bacterial growth starts. I use my sponge everyday so it definitely gets a lot of wear.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Buff Puff in the past, which is a similar product, but I always found it to be too course and would make my face feel raw. This face sponge is like washing your face with a very high quality washcloth. It&#x27;s smooth and soft and makes my face feel so much cleaner than washing with my hands alone. The sponge dries out pretty quickly. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks and it doesn&#x27;t have any musty smell. It also allows me to use significantly less face wash than I normally do. I use Philosophy&#x27;s Purity facial cleanser and though it&#x27;s certainly not the most expensive face wash around, it&#x27;s not cheap either so being able to use only about a third of what I had previously used is wonderful. The sponge really gets the cleanser to suds up well and since it very gently exfoliates, I don&#x27;t feel like I need to wash a second time.</li>
    <li> I honestly thought this was one of those sponges you use to blend in your foundation. I was totally wrong. Oops. It&#x27;s actually a hard sponge in the box, you add water and it softens up. It&#x27;s actually an exfoliating sponge! Interesting concept, but I don&#x27;t see a real need for this product considering all the other things out there you could use that would cost less and provided you with more product. Also personally because it is pretty much a sponge, I feel like it&#x27;s not long lasting as it can collect germs quickly.</li>
    <li> I really like this sponge. It softens right up when wet &amp; I&#x27;m actually having to use less facial cleanser because it suds up so well on the sponge. It fits nicely in my hand too.  The only draw back is that it takes so long to dry out. All in all I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a good facial sponge, and since I like other products by Ecotools, I was hoping that this might work for me.  The only prior facial scrubbie that I have liked was the \\&quot;scrublet\\&quot; that came with the facial cleanser [[ASIN:B002PBHQEK L&#x27;Oreal Paris Go 360 Clean]], but I can no longer find this in my area, and they seem to have stopped making the green version that I liked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem with other complexion sponges that I&#x27;ve tried is that 1) they don&#x27;t rinse clean, and/or 2) they fall apart easily.  The Ecotools sponge is very different.  Upon removal from the box, this tear-shaped product (about 3\\&quot;x2\\&quot;x2\\&quot;) is as hard as a rock!  As soon as you wet it, however, it softens up, developing a celluloid feel to it.  This makes it VERY gentle in the skin, but tough on dirt and makeup!  With a little cleanser (NOT makeup remover), I was able to clean EVERYTHING on my fact, something I can do well with cleanser alone.  Best of all, the sponge rinsed cleanly--NOTHING was left behind!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Currently, I have been using the sponge for less than a week, so I&#x27;ll have to see how it holds up over time (instructions say to replace every 1-3 months with proper care).  However, if this product continues to perform as well as it has been so far, I would definitely stock up on it in the future.</li>
    <li> This sponge is a great (and easy) way to exfoliate - and it is soft enough for sensitive, aging skin.  It doesn&#x27;t take many days to turn sluggish, dry-looking skin into dewy, fresh skin - particularly if you follow every cleansing with a good moisturizer.  There are so many things out there promising to give you results.  This sponge does make a visible difference.  Follow instructions.  Don&#x27;t rub too hard!</li>
    <li> This sponge starts off hard as a rock, but warm water softens it to an almost velvety texture.  It&#x27;s an excellent gentle exfoliator for everyday use.  I use it on my face, decolletage, elbows, and the backs of my hands.  Make sure to rinse thoroughly, because it loves to hold into soap.</li>
    <li> The sponge is more interesting as a novelty than anything else. Made out of a root starch, it starts out as a hard piece of Styrofoam-like material which softens quickly in water into a sponge. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week, and I&#x27;m not particularly impressed. Sure, it&#x27;s a gentle, exfoliating sponge. However, the life-span of the sponge is relatively short, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any benefit beyond what I can get with a decent washcloth. I can&#x27;t see paying $6 over and over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see that this type of sponge comes in other varieties that include facial clays and other additives, so perhaps those provide enough value versus than the plain sponge alone if you&#x27;re in need of those kind of facial treatments.</li>
    <li> This is a medium abrasion sponge.  I put the cleaner directly on it and used it.  I was pleased with the results. I felt cleaner than just washing my face with my hands.  The sponge softens when moistened. It is never as hard again as when it came out of the package but it does firm back up as it dries. It has held up great after a month of daily use.  It is small and fits nicely in the hand and in the soap dish.</li>
    <li> Deep cleans pores without overstripping and harshness.  Great for sensitive skin.  Would purchase again to use with mild cleansers and soap.</li>
    <li> This sponge feels like some sort of crunchy snack food when you take it out of the box but then softens dramatically in water.  It gets so soft, in fact, that if you really want a good scrub you might be better off with a wash cloth.  It creates a nice lather with my Neutrogena liquid cleanser, but it is hard to rinse the suds out completely and also hard to find a good spot to properly prop the sponge in its squishy jiggly wet state so it can dry well.  Not bad but not sure if I&#x27;d purchase again.</li>
    <li> It works just fine. It scrubs, it exfoliates, it isn&#x27;t harsh on the skin. It takes cleansers/soaps well. It seems to last as long as other sponges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just not 100% clear how this sponge is differentiating itself from other sponges in terms of effectiveness. It all seems to be about the eco-friendly angle. I suppose that those with a high eco-consciousness might find that appealing, I am indifferent,.</li>
    <li> The Good&lt;br /&gt;•100% natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;• Starts out dry and hard, softens when wet. You might ask why this even matters. Well, once it re-drys, it hardens back up. This makes it easy for travel purposes, because it&#x27;s harder to misshape or damage it. The texture definitely changes from wet to dry, which was interesting to learn!&lt;br /&gt;•Easy to wash. Cleanser washes out within five squeezes. And it&#x27;s soo fun to clean out!&lt;br /&gt;•Gentle on skin, but does a good exfoliation job for daily use. It glides on wet skin, but also will get rid of any dry skin problems you have.&lt;br /&gt;•Helps clear up skin. When I first started using this product, I was going thru a pretty bad acne break out. It cleared up within a few days. Recently, I have been pretty spotty with my skin care (bad of me, I know!), and I&#x27;ve started breaking out again. It&#x27;s obvious that the sponge really has been working to clear out all the extra junk in my pores.&lt;br /&gt;•Lasts up to 1-3 months. Plenty long for a facial sponge!&lt;br /&gt;•EcoTools is a vegan cosmetic brush brand that is 100% cruelty free.&lt;br /&gt;•EcoTools also made a sponge for deep cleaning. Great for those of us with dry, non-sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;•I haven&#x27;t found one, yet! Let me know if you have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I repurchase? Yes! At only $5.99, I can see myself repurchasing over and over without breaking the bank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I recieved this item complimentary for testing/review purposes via Influenster&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ One Curvy Blogger&lt;br /&gt;onecurvybloggerreviews.tumblr.com</li>
    <li> Just okay.  Not really what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> Seriously love everything from eco tools! Amazing!</li>
