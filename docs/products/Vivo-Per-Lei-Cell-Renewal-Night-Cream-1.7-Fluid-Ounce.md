      <li>but it&#x27;s not bad.  </li>
      <li>I was very happy when I received this product at such a low price compared to what I bought it for in the mall!</li>

      <li>I was right.</li>
      <li>my cream come in the mail very fast and the price was right on the nose for my pocket book</li>

      <li>This cream is very gentle</li>

      <li>my face, but they are much lighter now.  </li>
      <li>It feels very greasy on my face.  </li>

      <li>Highly recommend this cream.</li>
      <li>I ordered this pack, one was fine and very nice, as the original, but when I finished it and opened the second cream I got a very unpleasant surprise because the second cream IS NOT the original cream.</li>
      <li>I normally break out with others, also I&#x27;m 53 yrs old and it provides so much moisture</li>
      <li>As far as I can tell, the product is the exact same, just much cheaper!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for a few years, mostly because I decided I needed a night cream</li>
      <li>I am using this as a new product.  </li>

      <li>that could just be my face since am sensitive to alot of products.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
      <li>It makes my skin feel soft and doesn&#x27;t make me break out.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Fabulous cream.  A little strong scent but it goes away almost immediately.  It&#x27;s luxurious and the seller was very fast.</li>
    <li> Lovely! Thick, satiny feel that absorbs pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure this would be a great product for someone else, but the heavy fragrances in the cream made me break out. This is according to a dermatologist. I took the cream (was using the Vivo per lei day and night cream at the time) with me to my dermatologist appointment because I was breaking around my chin/mouth area (diagnosed with paraoral dermatitis).She recommended using moisturizers/creams with &amp;#34;less fragrances&amp;#34; so this cream went.to my sister.</li>
    <li> use this product all the time.  It&#x27;s fabulous</li>
    <li> Do not by these at the mall, this is the exact same stuff. I love it, my favorite night cream</li>
    <li> I like this cream.  My face feels really smooth, even in the mornings.  I can tell the difference.</li>
    <li> I really like this product better than I thought I would. It is extremely moisturizing. After months of struggling with dry chapped hands from a long winter, one night I decided to try it on my hands. The results were immediate. The next morning they were almost completely well. I used it one more night and that was all it took. So, my thoughts are, if it works that well on extremely dry hands it will be amazing on my face. I was right. I deducted one star for the fragrance. It is a bit strong. Would prefer a lighter scent. But it isn&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
    <li> very heavy cream. i use it for night time and works great on my dry skin.</li>
    <li> i love it . I t leaves my face feeling smooth and soft and helps to dimenish age lines. Its my favorite moisturizer!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for a few years, mostly because I decided I needed a night cream (start at 24! it helps!) and this was affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a heavy cream, but not greasy.  You will wake up looking refreshed and rested with this plus some good sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, this works really well.  Not sayin&#x27; nothing but I&#x27;m approaching late-20s and I still get ID&#x27;d and asked &#x27;What&#x27;s your major?&#x27;  I&#x27;d call that a win!</li>
    <li> Very good product, great moisturizer, and fast delivery .</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my choice for a night cream.  It is everything I could want in a face cream.  would highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> I bought it because it was a top selling item and I needed a night cream for my regimen. This cream felt effective as a hydrating agent, but I have discovered that this is causing consistent breakouts, so I had to toss it.</li>
    <li> Really feels nice on your skin and has a nice but not overbearing fragrance.</li>
    <li> Nice and thick cream which provides a good amount of moisture</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the night cream ... It&#x27;s very soft and when I apply it smells lovely.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this cream to anyone</li>
    <li> so far its been a great cream for me my skin is softer along with the other products that I use&lt;br /&gt;like the Cell rejuv.by vivo and the eye cream and the day cream.&lt;br /&gt;you do not have to use an awful lot because it may irritate some sensitive areas of your face&lt;br /&gt;and that could just be my face since am sensitive to alot of products.&lt;br /&gt;But I love the products specially it smells so good and am seeing some results on my face&lt;br /&gt;so am sticking with it.</li>
    <li> This cream is very gentle I normally break out with others, also I&#x27;m 53 yrs old and it provides so much moisture my skin no longer feels dry and flakey I use in day and night</li>
    <li> I was very happy when I received this product at such a low price compared to what I bought it for in the mall! As far as I can tell, the product is the exact same, just much cheaper!</li>
    <li> Works better than other products at the stores for a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I use this at night. When I first put it on I thought it would be too oily, but my skin was less oily in the morning than it is if I don&#x27;t use anything. It does have a strong smell, but it is not unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;Buy this from amazon, I was looking for a list of ingredients on the product website and it is listed at $100.</li>
    <li> I am buying this product for over a year, obviously  because it is good and helps avoiding dry skin&lt;br /&gt;and helps toto keep my skin hydrated over night.I will recomended, it is a good product  with a reasonable pric</li>
    <li> I am using this as a new product.  Have used Philosophy and other much more expensive face creams but think this is just as good at a much better price.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this product three times threw amazon. The last shipment I got was totally diffrent from past shipment the smell is totally diffrent and seems to make my face itchy!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years now and it&#x27;s another reason I&#x27;m happy for the existence of Amazon reviewers. This is actually my day and night cream but being over 40 my face can handle the thicker moisturizers during day use especially in the winter. There&#x27;s a big difference from the moment I go from a dried just wash face to when I apply this moisturizer. Doesn&#x27;t make it a permanent change of course but enough that I never go on a overnight trip without it.</li>
    <li> I would never have tried this line of skin care if it hadn&#x27;t been offered at such a discount but, plan to continue using at any price !</li>
    <li> Arrived as promised.  It feels very greasy on my face.  It&#x27;s an uncomfortable feeling. Don&#x27;t know if I will use it.</li>
    <li> I have not used long enough to really rate it.  So far, so good.  I will see at the end of the time</li>
    <li> Using for a week now and so far it feels very nice I have dry skin and it feels silky!</li>
    <li> Exceeded my expectations. I am a heavy equipment operator, soon to be 62 years old. My face has endured a lot of harsh elements. The peel erased a lot of age and discoloration. The day and night cream have returned a luster that has been missing for several years.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know much about face cream, but it&#x27;s not greasy (though I wake up wanting to wash my face).  It makes my skin feel soft and doesn&#x27;t make me break out.  It does have a strong smell but it&#x27;s not bad.  I joke with my boyfriend that it makes me feel like an elderly Parisian whore.</li>
    <li> Not an awful product. But won&#x27;t repurchase</li>
    <li> Very nice feeling and not greasy</li>
    <li> have used for a couple of years with great results, will order again</li>
    <li> I ordered this pack, one was fine and very nice, as the original, but when I finished it and opened the second cream I got a very unpleasant surprise because the second cream IS NOT the original cream. It looks like glycerin with a nice perfume. The first cream was the original (because I know the original), but the second cream is not even good for hand cream! If you´re gonna do this, it´s better just to sell one cream, not two.</li>
    <li> my cream come in the mail very fast and the price was right on the nose for my pocket book</li>
    <li> Bought this product somewhere else when I started using it.  The cost almost made me not purchase it.  When I ran out I searched Amazon and wow was I shocked at how reasonably priced this was.  This is a great night cream that is a nice consistency - not heavy nor is it greasy.  I will use this as long as I can get it from Amazon!</li>
    <li> I love all the Vivo products. The best thing I have found for my dry skin. I would recommend this to any one with dry skin.</li>
    <li> I admit, the thing I like most about this cream is the smell, but it does leave my skin feeling great.  I will definitely reorder time and time again.</li>
    <li> I started ordering this product last year.  I use the night cream day and night.  I have had several&lt;br /&gt;people tell me how great my skin looks.  I am 64 and my skin has never looked better.  I do have lines&lt;br /&gt;on my face, but they are much lighter now.  One of my co-workers admired the way my face looked and&lt;br /&gt;she ordered some and now ordered 20 more for her family. This is the best face cream I have ever used, and&lt;br /&gt;I have used the best.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I received it when expected, and no problems at all.</li>
    <li> I love this night cream so much, I wear it during the day!! It&#x27;s so hydrating and moisturizing. It really feels like my skin is firming back up because of all the moisture that&#x27;s being put back in it. I love the way it feels and it smells good, too.</li>
    <li> Then it wasn&#x27;t doing it&#x27;s job.  It also has a fragrance to it.  Which isn&#x27;t suppose to be good for a facial product.  After seeing a Dermatologist  I may stay away from this one.  It&#x27;s all in personal preference. JAM</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, use it every day. Will continue to keep it in my bag of tricks. Love how it makes my skin feel.</li>
    <li> Did not know the ingredients included mineral oil or I would not have ordered it</li>
    <li> The best night cream I have ever used. It moisturizes very well. In the morning my face feels very soft and silky. Highly recommend this cream. The price is great too!</li>
    <li> Arrived just in time as I was almost out of this wonderful night cream</li>
    <li> I have oily skin. This Night Cream is definitely creamy and NOT greasy, in my opinion. It lasts all night and leaves my skin very soft with a beautiful glow. Yes it is worth the money! People please do not scammed at the shopping malls for this wonderful product!</li>
    <li> Love this product as it feels great on.</li>
