      <li>This is a nice dryer with adequate power.  </li>
      <li>It certainly does do a good job.  </li>
      <li>Remington hair dryer has, so far, been a great product.</li>
      <li>Excellent hair dryer, but my impression is that the controls could be a little more ergonomic.  </li>
      <li>The finish on the housing is non-slip, so it is easy to grasp and it stays where you put</li>
      <li>Controls are easy to use.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and lightweight.</li>
      <li>air filter is removable and be sure to clean it about once a week.  </li>
      <li>The control&#x27;s were easy to use-3 heats and 2 speeds-easy just the way that we like it.</li>
      <li>The motor doesn&#x27;t seem as strong in this one.  </li>
      <li>This one is just fine for me.  </li>
      <li>It has a silky matte finish that I very much enjoy.</li>
      <li>I received this item as a test product for the VINE review program, but this is a great hair dryer for a low price.</li>
      <li>and I want to look fabulous</li>
      <li>The bonus is that I get a smooth textured outcome that air drying just doesn&#x27;t give me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The attachments fit well, but the diffuser attachment comes in the handiest as always.</li>
      <li>and the price is fantastic.</li>
      <li>I wanted something that was light weight and comfortable to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;It has a soft-touch finish and the handle is comfortable.  </li>
      <li>This one is very fancy and nice to the touch when using.</li>
      <li>She washes her hair twice a week, so it is important to her that her hairdryer works</li>
      <li>I repeat when tossed lightly and dried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The best use of the hair dryer for me was how fast I can dry my hair.  </li>
      <li>It helps prevent that familiar burning hair smell from filling up the bathroom.</li>
      <li>The higher setting would be better for straightening.</li>
      <li>My hair looked full and fabulous.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never understood the purpose of a cool shot button.</li>
      <li>My wife really loves this hair dryer, and she fell in love as soon as she took it out of the box.</li>
      <li>It has a cool shot and also a high/low feature.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also got a cool finish, which the box calls a &amp;#34;Soft Touch Finish.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Cool shot feature</li>
      <li>interesting thing about this blow dryer (apart from the finish) is that it is much quieter than others I have had.  </li>
      <li>It also has a cool shot to help set my  hair once it’s dried.&lt;br</li>
      <li>There is also a cool shot button for getting the air cool quickly as you are styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>so hot that it burns my fine hair.</li>
      <li>I have used, and more likely that I will use it more.  </li>
      <li>The heat settings are what you&#x27;d expect, and the dryer does a good job of getting your hair dry fast without too much static buildup.</li>
      <li>I have used, and more likely that I will use it more.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s comfortable in my hand thanks to the shape, and since it&#x27;s light weight, it doesn&#x27;t tire my arm out when a project takes a while to dry/set.</li>
      <li>This dryer works great for me; it is quiet, efficient and really dries my hair quickly.</li>
      <li>For now I&#x27;m planning to stick with old reliable; its lighter and more straightforward.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is large, but designed well so that it is comfortable to hold.  </li>
      <li>I like this dryer a lot better than my old dryer.  </li>
      <li>It generates 90% more ions than standard dryers to give you a frizz-free and silky smooth finish.</li>
      <li>This hair dryer is well-made, hefty and powerful.</li>
      <li>I actually own a similar hair dryer and have used it practically every day.</li>
      <li>the pro side:&lt;br /&gt;It is powerful and dries fast.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It seems to me that the ceramic coating matters most when it contacts your hair directly.  </li>
      <li>I destroyed a blow dryer by not cleaning the filter - it overheats the motor and kills it pretty quickly.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My wife really loves this hair dryer, and she fell in love as soon as she took it out of the box. That&#x27;s not surprising, since this blow dryer is pretty sleek looking. It&#x27;s also got a cool finish, which the box calls a &amp;#34;Soft Touch Finish.&amp;#34; Translation? It has kind of a matte, rubbery feel to it. The dryer&#x27;s 1875 watts also produce some serious drying power, with two speeds and three heat settings. The bottom line? It dries hair super fast. One of the best features of this dryer is the removable air filter. It&#x27;s simple to unscrew the filter on the back of the unit and clean out the accumulated hair and dust. It helps prevent that familiar burning hair smell from filling up the bathroom. My wife doesn&#x27;t use the two included attachments--a diffuser and a concentrator--but it&#x27;s nice to have them available. Add to that a rubber hang loop for easy storage and a FOUR-YEAR warranty, and you have yourself an impressive blow dryer!</li>
    <li> Love this Remington hair dryer! I don&#x27;t use one a lot but my wife and daughter uses them all the time and they were excited to be getting this! You should see the old ones we have(had) I could not believe how many we had so they all went to the trash (all of them were scattered among the several bathrooms that we have). This one is very fancy and nice to the touch when using. The control&#x27;s were easy to use-3 heats and 2 speeds-easy just the way that we like it. My wife personally loved the diffuser that was included in this set for her kinky curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A high end hair dryer that will not break the bank!</li>
    <li> This is a really nice hair dryer from Remington. The handle and controls  are very ergonomic, and the head is well balanced so that it doesn&#x27;t get to be a chore handling it. The heat settings are what you&#x27;d expect, and the dryer does a good job of getting your hair dry fast without too much static buildup. What I really like about this dryer is the generous cord length and the ability to hand the dryer from a hook. The attachments fit well, but the diffuser attachment comes in the handiest as always.</li>
    <li> This is your basic hair dryer.  Has some temperature settings, a diffuser and focus attachment.  Grippy material on the outside makes the dryer easy to keep your hands on.  Performs pretty well without being too noisy.  It&#x27;s not whisper quiet but it&#x27;s better than average on noise to me.</li>
    <li> This is an extra dryer we use upstairs after the kids take their baths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ergonomics is good and you don&#x27;t accidentally press any buttons while holding it at various angles.  The fan speeds are powerful and the different heat settings are definitely appreciated.  Also, it has the typical &amp;#34;cool-shot&amp;#34; button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a blade-diverter attachment as well as a volumizer attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The length of the cord is reasonable even with a 1-yr old running around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weight and feel are good as well as it has a high-quality feel to it, perhaps the ceramic coating or so, doesn&#x27;t feel plastic-y at all.  We would definitely recommend this to any household from little toddlers to adults.</li>
    <li> I actually own a similar hair dryer and have used it practically every day. It&#x27;s easy to use and lightweight. The air flow is crisp and dries hair in no time. It comes with two attachments - one to create curliness and another to funnel direct heat with. You can clean out the air flow in the back of the hair dryer easily and you can hang it on the wall if you have a hook, but it doesn&#x27;t come with a holder to mount on the wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s efficient and easy to use and a good buy if  you&#x27;re in the market for a new hair dryer.</li>
    <li> This is a nice dryer with adequate power.  I like this dryer a lot better than my old dryer.  For example: This has a matte finish, so it tends to stay on my counter, not sliding around.  It has multiple settings, and the switches and buttons are positioned so you don&#x27;t accidentally hit them and turn the unit on or off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves your hair soft and smooth.  This professional hair dryer works 50% faster than standard Remington dc dryers thanks to the 1875-watt motor. It generates 90% more ions than standard dryers to give you a frizz-free and silky smooth finish. This set includes two attachment heads a narrow concentrator for precision styling, and a diffuser to maintain curls and texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plug has a safety button as you might have on your outlet.  I needed to push this in prior to using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design is very smart, as I mentioned about the button placement, and the curves.  It certainly does do a good job.  With a little bit of product, after parting my hair, air-drying, and towel-drying, I&#x27;ve been putting a bit of product on my hair - just a bit - and lowering my head so I can get the roots dry first, then finger-drying it smooth.  I have long, fine, layered and slightly wavy hair.  My hair looked full and fabulous.  I have tried this with hair moisturizer and hair gel.  Both times with lots of pretty volume.  Naturally, my hair sticks to my head and waves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I want voluminous waves, I do the same except after almost drying roots, and giving the hair a general toss, I scrunch my hair with my towel until wavy.  I also use my fingers to do the same.  Finger waves like they did in the twenties:&#x3D;).  If I don&#x27;t already have product on my hair and I want to look fabulous, I spray a bit of stiff hair spray on curls and use my hands to accentuate them.  I repeat when tossed lightly and dried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This blow dryer is just the right speed and temperature. It doesn&#x27;t overblown my hair,. leaving it dry.</li>
    <li> My hairdryer was noisy and past its prime, so I was delighted to try this new Remington dryer. It&#x27;s sleek and it&#x27;s quiet. It&#x27;s a bit heavier than my old Conair, but not so heavy as to be uncomfortable to hold. In fact, it has a very nice, slim grip and I like the matte finish. My hair is indeed shinier, as promised. An unexpected extra is that it stays straighter, a real bonus in heat and humidity. I may never use the attachments (diffuser and focused stream) but it&#x27;s nice to have them. I&#x27;m enjoying my new dryer and look forward to a long relationship.</li>
    <li> The best thing about this Remington hair dryer for me is the speed at which it dries my hair. On the high setting, it blows strongly and gets the moisture out of my hair fast. I don’t like using the hottest of the three heat settings, but even on medium and low it works to dry my hair very efficiently. It also has a cool shot to help set my  hair once it’s dried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weight of the dryer is adequate; it’s not the lightest I’ve used, but not too heavy to hold for the duration of the drying time. I prefer the control buttons to be on the side of the handle, because I sometimes will press them accidently with my fingers. I haven’t had that problem much with this dryer though. I wish the cord were a little longer so I could move around more, especially if someone is in the bathroom with me. The dryer is pink, which is lovely if you like that color. The dryer comes with a diffuser too, but I typically don’t use it. Overall, this dryer is working well for me and I’m happy to have it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on the road vacationing and brought this dryer with me. I have very long hair and swim a lot in chlorinated pools. That means a ton of showers and wet hair. This dryer works great for me; it is quiet, efficient and really dries my hair quickly. It sn&#x27;t so hot that it burns my fine hair. The bonus is that I get a smooth textured outcome that air drying just doesn&#x27;t give me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the aesthetic side I love the textured feel to this dryer&#x27;s exterior. It has a silky matte finish that I very much enjoy. Lovely color as well.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair dryer my wife has ever had. She washes her hair twice a week, so it is important to her that her hairdryer works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The Remington dried her hair in half the time as her previous ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It is significantly lighter weight than her previous dryer, so it is easier to hold up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The finish on the housing is non-slip, so it is easy to grasp and it stays where you put it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a very nice unit. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Edited January 2016:  After only six months, this dryer is wearing out.  It gets way too intensely hot, even on the medium setting, probably because the fan is barely blowing.  Hardly any difference at all between low and high fan, and it barely makes a breeze, so my hair is getting all heat and no movement. I went out and replaced it today.</li>
    <li> In the past year I have stopped blow drying my hair straight, opting to let my curls be free. I love that this dryer has a diffuser attachment. Most hair dryers only come with the concentrator attachment. My curls, which have really improved since quitting straightening,now take forever to dry, since my hair is not dried out, anymore. I can use this on my curls to dry them quickly, since I hate leaving the house with wet hair. The diffuser works well, not frizzing my hair at all and my curls are bouncier than when they air dry. That&#x27;s a great plus. I only need about 5 minutes of drying time to achieve 95% dry hair. It has a cool shot and also a high/low feature. This dryer gets very hot, so I dry my curls on the medium setting, which is still hot. The higher setting would be better for straightening.</li>
    <li> The Remington Studio Silk dryer is very large and powerful.  It comes with 2 attachments, one to focus the air and the other to diffuse it.  What I like best about it is the amount of control it gives you, from the choice of heads to the variable heat.  It is a good  choice for people who use a blow dryer for styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a number of ceramic appliances and this one makes less sense than most.  It seems to me that the ceramic coating matters most when it contacts your hair directly.  I have never experienced any benefit from any appliance which claimed that it generated ions, and did not notice much of a difference in that regard here either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is large, but designed well so that it is comfortable to hold.  It has a very solid build and looks like it will hold up well over time.  That has always been my experience with Remington products.  It&#x27;s a brand I look to first in a number of areas because I have has consistently good experience with their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a little folding conair dryer which I liked quite  a lot for its&#x27; portability. I live in Hawaii and rarely blow dry, using them more when I travel.  My daughter went to college in Cleveland and needed it more than I did, so it left with her the last time she visited.  This one is more powerful with more features, but considerably less portable.  Maybe I can swap with her the next time she visits ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a very competent dryer with good safety features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the pro side:&lt;br /&gt;It is powerful and dries fast.&lt;br /&gt;Has 2 attachments to focus to diffuse the air.&lt;br /&gt;Has 3 heat and 2 speed  settings, giving you a lot of control.&lt;br /&gt;Cool air setting allows you to dry without damage&lt;br /&gt;Nice safety features&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest down side for me is the size. It is not something I would ever pack with the current charges and limitation on luggage.  That makes it a good deal less useful to me since I seldom use a blow dryer at home but do when I travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In sum it is a nice blow dryer, very powerful with a good deal of control over heat and speed settings, and attachments which allow you to focus or diffuse the air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite feature I the cool air setting which dries without causing damage (the main reason I have avoided using blow dryers much in the past). I came back and revised my rating becase this feature makes it more useful than any blow drier I have used, and more likely that I will use it more.  I would rather not go to sleep with wet hair and if I can dry without causing damage, this becomes verry much more useful.at and speed settings, and attachments which allow you to focus or diffuse the air.

    <li> I am quite a fan of Remington hair dryers and while my old one is still quite functional, I prefer the newer Remington AC2015C T|Studio Silk AC Professional Hair Dryer.  The newer model has basically the exact same functions as my older, far more expensive model; 1875-watt motor, two attachments, the heat settings, three speeds, and a cold air setting.  The newer Remington AC2015C is heavier, which I actually prefer, the attachments are about 50% smaller, another bonus for me, as I already have straight, thin hair, and the other attachments were too much attachment for my needs.  This ceramic model has a coating that I like; it keeps my hands from slipping.  The control buttons are still on the underside of the handle, which I prefer, as it is easier to adjust, in my opinion.  This model appears to dry my hair faster than my older, more expensive model, and both offer a smooth, frizz free finish.  I would highly recommend this hair dryer, it does what it says it does and the price is fantastic.</li>
    <li> Excellent hair dryer, but my impression is that the controls could be a little more ergonomic.  Quieter than most hair dryers, I particularly like the small rubber nubs on the side which help keep it on your counter.  3 fan settings and 2 heat settings (3 if you include heat off) plus a &amp;#34;Cool shot&amp;#34; button.</li>
    <li> I have short hair so this hair dryer was field tested by my wife, who has long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dryer is easy to hold and is lighter weight that my wife&#x27;s old hair dryer. The temperature settings allow blow drying without focusing heat on the hair and damaging it (my wife has delicate hair that gets split ends easily). The hair dryer is not as noisy as my wife&#x27;s previous drying, but it seems to dry her hair faster. Remington touts the &amp;#34;silk ceramic coating&amp;#34; on the dryer grill. I&#x27;m not sure whether this provides the benefits mentioned, but the drying did leave my wife&#x27;s hair soft. Since we only used to for drying hair we never tried it on the highest setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Remington hair dryer has, so far, been a great product. We will probably buy another one for our guest room.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is well-made, hefty and powerful. It has a heavy-duty power cord with strain relief and a loop for hanging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two rocker switches, for high and low airflow and three levels of heat, plus a convenient cool shot button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two attachments, a concentrating nozzle and a diffuser.  The filter can be removed for cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a soft-touch finish and the handle is comfortable.  It is relatively easy to maneuver despite being a bit bulky and heavy, as is appropriate for a professional model.</li>
    <li> I have multiple Remington hairdryers and this is my least favorite.  It is loud and heavy to hold.  It actually takes longer to dry my hair than the other ones I own.  Love the color, but thats about it.  The other two Remington hair dryers I own have added benefits of smoothing or taming frizz, etc... this one doesn&#x27;t do any of that... it&#x27;s just a normal, no thrills hair dryer and takes almost twice as long to dry my hair on the highest, hottest setting :(  The motor doesn&#x27;t seem as strong in this one.  Would not purchase in the future.</li>
    <li> I already have the D3190A, which is a LOT like this AC215C that I selected for my daughter because she likes this color better than the purple.&lt;br /&gt;They both have the &amp;#34;cool shot feature&amp;#34; which we love, and the cleanable filter (*VERY important feature to keep airflow going strong) which is key to its ability to dry hair quickly, you would think all hair dryers would have it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to its features: it has the three heat settings &amp; two power settings (*I wish it had 3 power settings!)&lt;br /&gt;It has a concentrator and a diffuser which my daughter who has a head full of natural curls says it is an ESSENTIAL attachment to have if you have curls like her.&lt;br /&gt;It also has the &amp;#34;ionic (heat protection) technology&amp;#34; that keeps your hair free from frizz &amp; fly aways, it dries hair fast we both have long hair &amp; it doesn&#x27;t tangle it all up when blow drying on high,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* ALL of this is just like the purple D3190A model, where it differs is that this one has a&lt;br /&gt;FOUR year warranty as opposed to the D3190A, which only has a 2 yr warranty and they say it has a Salon quality AC motor for 4 times a longer life&lt;br /&gt;so, that explains the longer warranty. For $10.00 more you get a better value as this is supposed to last twice as long as the purple D3190A one that is $20.00&lt;br /&gt;They both function excellently, if money is tight get the purple D3190A one, if you have the extra $10 I would go with this one!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice hair blow dryer.  The color is a lovely medium shade of pink that is in a matte tone versus a plastic looking shiny one.  The dryer comes with a diffuser which works well for my curly hair.  It has an unusual type of soft touch finish.  It doesn&#x27;t feel slippery at all.  It fits well in the hand and the finish seems to be it fit a little more snug that others I have had before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The air filter is removable and be sure to clean it about once a week.  I destroyed a blow dryer by not cleaning the filter - it overheats the motor and kills it pretty quickly.  Along with the diffuser, there is a very narrow concentrator attachment which works really well if you need to put heat on a precise spot.  There are three heat settings and two speeds.  There is also a cool shot button for getting the air cool quickly as you are styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The interesting thing about this blow dryer (apart from the finish) is that it is much quieter than others I have had.  My first thought was that it meant that it wasn&#x27;t as powerful but that is not the case.  It works well and is not as loud.</li>
    <li> This blow dryer arrived compliments of the Vine program.  It is supposed to dry hair quickly and with minimal frizz and damage.  I found the drying time to be the same if not slower than my Conair 1875 blow dryer.  The rocker buttons are in an awkward thumb position and get in the way of a smooth grip on the handle.  Top it off with a very bulky and weighted feel and you have a dryer that is not suitable for our preference.</li>
    <li> When I took the dryer out of the package the first thing I noticed was the great color. The 2nd thing was how heavy it is. For me, too heavy to comfortably hold for 10 minutes at my age. This dryer does have some great setting options that most don&#x27;t have for this price. I also liked how my fine hair looked after using the dryer. My hair seems to have more volume. I doubt if I will reach for this dryer when my lightweight one dries my hair in the same amount of time. So the claim that it dries your hair 4X faster is just not true. Someone not bothered by the weight would probably love it!</li>
    <li> The Remington Hair Dryer is not my favorite hair dryer.  The air flow concentrator attachment and the air flow diffuser,  plus how fast you can dry your hair are the pro&#x27;s.  Con:  Too heavy to hold, Have to hold hair dryer where the power, speed, burst and temperature controls are which is very awkward and uncomfortable.  Hair dryer doesn&#x27;t swivel.  The best use of the hair dryer for me was how fast I can dry my hair.  The worst use of the hair dryer for me is that it doesn&#x27;t swivel.  I don&#x27;t recommend this hair dryer as Remington makes a much better one and I do own that one.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice hair dryer that does the job well.  I have medium length hair and the dryer dried it quickly.  I hate to dry my hair, so that is a big plus factor for me.  It&#x27;s comfortable to hold, not too heavy.  Controls are easy to use.  I didn&#x27;t need the do anything fancy, so I used it as I do every other hair dryer.  The box says it&#x27;s professional, used in salons.  Hair dressers could comment more on the differences between dryers.  I&#x27;m not too picky about it as long as it isn&#x27;t uncomfortable to use and works well. This one is just fine for me.  I&#x27;d recommend.</li>
    <li> I received this item as a test product for the VINE review program, but this is a great hair dryer for a low price. it has 1875 watts, which is 25 more than most, and more ion presentation for quicker hair drying. Ions are funny things Ionized air respells water, and deionized water falls off easier, so if there was a way you could wash your hair in DI water, you would really have it made, cleaner hair that dries very fast, but I digress. This dryer does the job of a much more expensive professional dryer, it is a good buy!</li>
    <li> I’m always in search of a hair dryer that can blow dry my thick, curly hair as well as my stylist does. (I know … I know … it’s the person not the tool.) When she dries it, she barely has to touch it up with a flat iron. When I dry it … I have to do a little more work to straighten out the wavy stragglers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review compares the Revlon 1875W Tourmaline Ionic Ceramic Dryer, Remington Damage Control (DC) Ceramic Hair Dryer, and this one (Remington T|Studio Silk AC Professional Hair Dryer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated 11 Nov 2016: I switched back to this when my main one died. And downgraded it one star. It&#x27;s just not as hot as the previous or when I first tried this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of them have:&lt;br /&gt;  * Same wattage&lt;br /&gt;  * Three heat settings&lt;br /&gt;  * Two speed settings&lt;br /&gt;  * Cool shot feature&lt;br /&gt;  * Diffuser and concentrator attachments&lt;br /&gt;  * Ionic technology&lt;br /&gt;  * Ceramic technology&lt;br /&gt;  * Hanging loop&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Revlon does not come with a removable filter, the two Remingtons do. (The TStudio doesn’t say it on the box or description. Company website confirms it.) Revlon and Remington Damage Control have tourmaline technology, the TStudio does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Revlon’s concentrator attachment stays on. The Remington’s fall off often. If I put the dryer down to adjust my hair, it comes off some of the time. It&#x27;s hot to put it back on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All three take about the same time to dry my hair. I may have gotten slightly better results (less wavy) with the Remingtons than with the Revlon. I say “may” because the difference wasn’t large enough to be clear. Some days I do a better job than others. Human error, you know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Damage Control felt like it took less effort and the reason is most likely because it’s the lightest of the three. The shell of the DC and Revlon are plastic while the T|Studio uses better quality materials. But it could be the better quality materials that make it heavier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can only assume the DC is cheaper than the T|Studio because of its plastic shell even though it has tourmaline technology, which the T|Studio does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve yet to try the diffusers. Whenever I wear my hair curly, I let it dry naturally. That’s the whole point of going curly – not having to do any hair drying. As for noise – I can’t answer which one is quietest because I’m deaf. It’s not a good idea to wear hearing aids while drying wet hair. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The winner? The Remington DC because it takes the least amount of effort to use and produces the same results as the others. The T|Studio is just too heavy and the Revlon doesn’t perform as well as the DC.s cheaper than the T|Studio because of its plastic shell even though it has tourmaline technology, which the T|Studio does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve yet to try the diffusers.

    <li> From Ms. s1rude.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using an older model Remington hairdryer for years, so I was able to compare this model to an another model of the same brand.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have a model number on my current hairdryer because all of the writing has been rubbed off, but it has a single switch to select hi/low warm speeds or cool mode. The AC2015C has two switches, one allows you to select between three temperatures, the other between two speeds. There is a &amp;#34;cool shot&amp;#34; button. I have fine, straight shoulder length hair and don&#x27;t really use my dryer for anything other than drying, so I&#x27;ve never understood the purpose of a cool shot button. Were I to use this function, I prefer my existing drying because you can set it to cool mode with the switch, while the new model requires you to hold the button down continuously for cool air. The AC2015C is more than twice as heavy as and slightly larger than my existing dryer, which I didn&#x27;t care for. Pros of the AC2015C are that it is a nice looking dryer, and if its anything like my old Remington, it will probably last forever. For now I&#x27;m planning to stick with old reliable; its lighter and more straightforward.</li>
    <li> I have 3 Remington blow dryers and this my favorite one.  It is a little less heavy to hold than my old one and does a terrific job on my hair.  I blow dry over all first with my head upside down for fullness and then use curling brushes to style it.  This one has enough heat on the highest setting to set the curl.  Other blow dryers don’t.  You don’t have to use this hot a setting but for me it is a necessity.  Another thing I like about it is the cool shot gets really cold fast.  I use that too and sometimes blow dryers just don’t get the cool shot cold.  I don’t use the diffuser that comes with the dryer but I do use the airflow concentrator.  As with most new blow dryers it is a bit difficult to get on and off when the dryer is new, but after you use it awhile it will come on and off just fine.  The dryer keeps away the frizzies.  I don’t know if it is better or not for my hair than any other dryer.  Only time will tell.</li>
    <li> I do not dry my hair with a hair dryer, but I will use it to set a style on occasion. My main use for a hair dryer is crafts, diy projects, and science experiments, so my review is based upon the usefulness for those purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My old hair dryer, which I&#x27;ve had for many years, is finally on its last legs, so it was time for a new hair dryer. I didn&#x27;t need something that cost an arm and a leg as I don&#x27;t need all the dings and whistles for my purposes. I just needed something that had different heat settings and air flow settings. I wanted something that was light weight and comfortable to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hair dryer fits the bill with its 3 heat settings and 2 speed settings. For more delicate items, I use the low heat and low speed. For shrink wrapping baskets, I use either the medium or high heat setting and high speed. The high heat is hot and this hair dryer can really kick out the air which makes the shrink wrapping go a lot faster than it did with my old hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s comfortable in my hand thanks to the shape, and since it&#x27;s light weight, it doesn&#x27;t tire my arm out when a project takes a while to dry/set.</li>
    <li> A great blowdryer with a great feel holding it, excellent heat control, and a cord that doesn&#x27;t get tangled. My wife is happy so great job, Remington!</li>
