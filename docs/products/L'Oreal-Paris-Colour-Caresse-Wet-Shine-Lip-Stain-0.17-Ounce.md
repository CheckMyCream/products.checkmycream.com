      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Nice product.  </li>
      <li>I bought the rose colored one</li>
      <li>She has beautiful full lips</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure how this product gets these great reviews about it being the best ever</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>And I love the color.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;M pleased</li>
      <li>Absolutely love this shade.</li>
      <li>Very bright red, almost magenta.  </li>
      <li>The color looks fine, but the product was delivered with no plastic/shrink-wrap protection.</li>
      <li>but if you don&#x27;t mind a little shine/gloss to your lips this is perfect.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t like how it came without a case or protective seal, but aside from that, the product is fantastic.</li>
      <li>It stays on longer than others and is comfortable and not sticky.</li>
      <li>Color was true and texture smooth.</li>
      <li>I have very fair skin, so it looks a little darker than I wanted, but not bad.</li>
      <li>It does stay for a long period of time, But I do carry it with me in the event that i feel the need to add some more!</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s the point of a lip stain right??</li>
      <li>It had a beautiful finish and a deep, bold red while going on light and never heavy.</li>
      <li>Love the lip stain and have ordered several colors.</li>
      <li>its ok wish it would last longer</li>
      <li>The texture/consistency wasn&#x27;t exactly what I expected, but I liked it.</li>
      <li>It stays on pretty well, but I do have to reapply otherwise</li>
      <li>Wear on top of your red lipstick and it stays on all day and also leaves a shine to your lips.</li>
      <li>The color stays for the whole day!</li>
      <li>This is a wonderful product, It does stay slightly &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; but it doesnt smear or wipe off onto other things.</li>
      <li>Particularly appreciated the tear-shaped applicator.  </li>
      <li>It is going straight to the trash.</li>
      <li>I should have known - none of the products advertised to work as a balm, stain and gloss all in one really works.  </li>
      <li>I was expecting a color that was Ruby red, well not exactly as expected, but a good red.</li>
      <li>It dries to an orangish tint.&lt;br /&gt;Third, it doesn&#x27;t stay on any longer than my normal go to lipgloss.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
      <li>The color is a lot DARKER on the lips than it looks in the container but that was fine since I was looking for a deep red.</li>
      <li>When I first applied it, I made the mistake of swiping the brush back and forth over my lips</li>
      <li>(  so NOTHING stays on me for more than 10 minutes and this endless red stayed on all afternoon!</li>
      <li>Note: if you want to tone it down, do it relatively quickly because once it&#x27;s on, you&#x27;ll need makeup remover or the like to take it right back off.</li>
      <li>Lasting power, cant really have a say.</li>
      <li>I think this is a color that will work for everyone, red is a classic.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love it! Stays on quite well and maintains color over hours of wear. When I first applied it, I made the mistake of swiping the brush back and forth over my lips and I didn&#x27;t give enough time between layers. The next time, I made single strokes going in one direction and allowed proper drying time. It had a beautiful finish and a deep, bold red while going on light and never heavy. There is a little bit of stickyness to the gloss, but that wears off with time.</li>
    <li> The color is absolutely magnificent. It stays on pretty well, but I do have to reapply otherwise it will look blotchy.</li>
    <li> It does not stay on as advertised. Very overpriced compared to other lipsticks that stay on and are less expensive</li>
    <li> The color stays for the whole day! Love it!</li>
    <li> The texture/consistency wasn&#x27;t exactly what I expected, but I liked it.</li>
    <li> Wear on top of your red lipstick and it stays on all day and also leaves a shine to your lips. It&#x27;s not too shiny. Obviously if you see going for a matte look this is not for you but if you don&#x27;t mind a little shine/gloss to your lips this is perfect. Also my lips always feel moisturizer after wearing this which is a plus</li>
    <li> love it!! this is my 2nd purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how this product gets these great reviews about it being the best ever and how it stays on. I am very disappointed in this &amp;#34;lip stain&amp;#34;.  I wouldn&#x27;t call this a stain but rather just another lipgloss that promises what it cannot deliver.&lt;br /&gt;First , it goes on well, but dries out quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Second, the color is nothing like the color on the tube. I bought the rose colored one and it is not rose or even pink for that matter. It dries to an orangish tint.&lt;br /&gt;Third, it doesn&#x27;t stay on any longer than my normal go to lipgloss.&lt;br /&gt;Will not be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> The color looks fine, but the product was delivered with no plastic/shrink-wrap protection. Since i don&#x27;t know if someone else has used this before it arrived at my home I&#x27;m afraid to try it out and can&#x27;t figure out how to return/exchange it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this shade. Had been looking a lip stain that actually stays and doesn&#x27;t need to be reapplied throughout the day... Cause that&#x27;s the point of a lip stain right?? Well this one lived up to its name. The color is a lot DARKER on the lips than it looks in the container but that was fine since I was looking for a deep red. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it takes a little effort to get an even coat on so putting it on the move is a bit tough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of people seem to have a problem with the smell but I think it smells like roses and hardly lingers for a couple of minutes. It does go on really dry so it&#x27;s almost like not having anything on the lips... Almost! Stays on even after a meal so a winner in my book!</li>
    <li> I should have known - none of the products advertised to work as a balm, stain and gloss all in one really works.  Lips left feeling dry after a while and very little shine.</li>
    <li> Love the lip stain and have ordered several colors. It stays on longer than others and is comfortable and not sticky.</li>
    <li> I tried hers and It does last for ages and I am so impressed that I have sent for one for me too. She has beautiful full lips but I have a skinny slash:(  so NOTHING stays on me for more than 10 minutes and this endless red stayed on all afternoon! Yippee!!</li>
    <li> I really liked this color!  Very bright red, almost magenta.  Particularly appreciated the tear-shaped applicator.  Applied a bit watery, dries a bit gummy.</li>
    <li> Want to return. It has a terrible stain on its case and looks like a used or returned one. I don&#x27;t wanna use it!</li>
    <li> It Nailed It&lt;br /&gt;It Worked When I Bought It And It Came On Time</li>
    <li> I was expecting a color that was Ruby red, well not exactly as expected, but a good red. I have very fair skin, so it looks a little darker than I wanted, but not bad. I think this is a color that will work for everyone, red is a classic. It does look good. In pictures it will look ruby red though. It is a little glossy, but in a different texture than lip gloss, it feels like rubbery. Lasting power, cant really have a say. Just tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is is not a matte color.</li>
    <li> Very nice color. Long lasting.</li>
    <li> its ok wish it would last longer</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t &#x27;bleed&#x27;, and didn&#x27;t dry out my lips. Color was true and texture smooth.</li>
    <li> Nice product.  I&#x27;M pleased</li>
    <li> This smells like straight alcohol mixed with some kind of other awful chemicals as well. There is no shine, it is drying, and smells awful. The color doesn&#x27;t even look the same when applied. It is going straight to the trash. Money wasted ! I give it 1 star for the packaging thats it.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product, It does stay slightly &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; but it doesnt smear or wipe off onto other things. It does stay for a long period of time, But I do carry it with me in the event that i feel the need to add some more! It does come off with a little bit of work with a napkin, If you planned on making out in this, You might want to bring some napkins and the tube with you just incase, It doesnt come off alot but could come off if you were to make out violently, lol.</li>
    <li> I am a bit of a makeup snob. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve bought a drugstore brand in close to ten years. But I saw this on some morning talk program and thought what the heck. I didn&#x27;t like how it came without a case or protective seal, but aside from that, the product is fantastic. It reminds me of the stain you got as a kid after a Popsicle. Once it&#x27;s on, it&#x27;s on for a while. I had to give a couple of presentations last week, and usually my lips tend to dry out and lipstick doesn&#x27;t wear the way I would want (constant talking + nerves, no doubt). No problem with this. It wore perfectly. And I love the color. Note: if you want to tone it down, do it relatively quickly because once it&#x27;s on, you&#x27;ll need makeup remover or the like to take it right back off. Love it.</li>
