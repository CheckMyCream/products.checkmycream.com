<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Great emollient qualities and melts easily to mix with other oils to make body butters.  Great if you like to smell like cocoa!</li>
    <li> Has a great cocoa smell and feels very smooth.  I also appreciate the resealable package.</li>
    <li> The product is high  quality; melts well, and tastes great. My only complaint is the stated weight is 16 o; but my bar, including the package, only weighed 15.5 oz.</li>
    <li> This is A quality product</li>
    <li> smells like cocoa but does not have a lot of flavour. first time i&#x27;ve tried eating cocoa butter, maybe that&#x27;s the way it is.</li>
    <li> I bought this cocoa butter to use when making my own body lotions.  I love the smell of it but as of yet I have not had time to make my lotions and creams. I am happy with the timely arrival of the product and can hardly wait to use it.  Thank you for sending me additional recipesl.</li>
    <li> Have used other Organic Coco Butters from Amazon but this is by far the best I have used !</li>
    <li> This is like the 100th time I&#x27;ve bought this cocoa butter. It&#x27;s great. Most of my scars have faded. Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> Smells like chocolate! I have used it to make four different lotions, and all have come out great. Would highly recommend this brand. I weighed it before using, and it is actually just a touch over the promised pound. Great packaging and no signs of age or spoilage. Will definitely order again!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I&#x27;m so happy with this purchase. I will purchase from this company again. The smell is incredible and it arrived fast in a good package and as soon as I opened the bag I was taken over by the delicious smell.</li>
    <li> Fabulous smell, works great in all my homemade products! Will purchase again, obviously high quality. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I know this is supposed to be great for your skin but I cannot get past the smell. Even after mixing with the coconut oil and almond oil.</li>
    <li> I use this to make some lipbalm and it was great!</li>
    <li> Real cocoa butter is the only kind to use :)</li>
    <li> Great product and great customer service from Aspen Naturals.</li>
    <li> I love this product....I love how the company gives you  different ideas with how to best use their product I will definitely order again</li>
    <li> Wonderful product!!!! I used it in my body butters and looking forward to using in lip balm.  Will purchase again and highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Delivered on time and product as described.</li>
    <li> Needed more description. Not what I expected, but my expectations were off.</li>
    <li> WOW! This cocoa butter just knocks you out with its scent, it smells AMAZING! As soon as you open the bag, the sweet chocolate scent greets your nose pleasantly. If you were blindfolded you would think you are smelling pure chocolate. It is in brick form sealed inside a resealable package when it arrives so you have to cut it to use it - unless you plan on using the whole thing all at once. It&#x27;s very smooth, and melts on contact with skin. Did I mention how yummy it smells? This product meets my expectations and standards in every way.</li>
    <li> This is the first cocoa butter I&#x27;ve purchased, but I love it! It smells so chocolaty and I&#x27;ve tried it for one of my recipes and it really is of great quality! I would recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> On time and as described.</li>
    <li> Good for soap making and non-food products. Does not taste or work well when making white chocolate - which is why I bought it. It&#x27;s not the worst thing, I will just use it to make bath fizzies and moisturizers since it failed to work in my chocolates.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t wait to use it on my lotions!</li>
    <li> I love love love the smell of this cocoa butter. This is the first time I purchased cocoa butter, I have natural hair so I&#x27;m mixing it with Shea Butter, so far so good but I do love the smell and  it leaves my skin so soft</li>
    <li> Had a bit of a sour smell - not sure if it&#x27;s a bit old or if i&#x27;m just not familiar with cocoa butter. Used it to make lotion bars and lip balm and once mixed with other ingredients smells lovely and chocolatey, and it&#x27;s really moisturising.</li>
    <li> I like it very hard and have a very chocolately smell. If you are sensitive to smell then get a refined cocoa butter. It is all of Raw and unrefined. I used this in my handmade soap and body products. Does wonders to the skin. Great for reducing dark marks and moisturizing the skin. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Great I use it also for my son&#x27;s Eczema and I make his cream works great ....</li>
    <li> Arrived just as described. Great product.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my son who lives in Chile and can&#x27;t get a lot of things at a decent price down there and he wanted to try making chocolate.  It came in a molded &amp;#34;brick&amp;#34; packaged in a sturdy silver plastic Ziploc bag and traveled very well from Illinois to Chile.  I guess it smelled heavenly when opened finally! :-D. His chocolate was well received so it&#x27;s good for more than skin applications I&#x27;d say! :-D</li>
    <li> Great product! Very happy with it, and I like that it comes in a large block.</li>
    <li> Delicious! Easily crumbled for protein shakes and the smell is divine! I&#x27;ve ordered other Aspen Naturals products since this and am very happy each time.</li>
    <li> Good quality. Smells great. Used in body butters. Delivery was quick and was before the estimated time.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! Smells amazing, feels amazing. Bought it for making lotions and I think I may also try to make chocolate it just smells that good!</li>
    <li> Smells great, feels awesome on skin, tastes good in chocolate, but dries up fast, even inside the package.</li>
    <li> Great product, but it is brick hard and and difficult to handle!</li>
    <li> Thanks a bunch! My Cocoa butter made it quickly and was exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Love the fragrance of cocoa butter. Very easy to work with. Nothing but natures products in my lotions and creams.</li>
    <li> Nice chocolatey aroma hits you when you open the bag. But gets kinda overpowering even when mixed with other oils and some essential oils.</li>
    <li> Very nice cocoa butter.  Smells great and has a nice consistency.  Melts easily and smoothly.  Will order again from this seller.</li>
    <li> Excellent texture, fragrance, workability.  Used in hand made body butter and worked great</li>
    <li> Great product! However, the weight was a little short.</li>
    <li> Great stuff- will buy again.</li>
    <li> Smells awesome! Mixed with Shea butter and my skin has never felt better. This is definitely pure and raw cocoa butter. Got here within 2 days with Amazon prime shipping as described.</li>
    <li> This is the most beautiful product.  I bought it to make chocolates and when I was melting it, my house was filled with the most beautiful chocolate smell.  And the chocolates I made were yum too!  The sellers are really professional and follow up on your purchase to make sure you are happy.  I &#x27;m definitely going to try the recipe they sent for skin.  Can&#x27;t wait!  Thanks for a beautiful product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really loving the lotions and butter bars I have made with this product so far.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality, smell, and consistency. While i&#x27;ve tried switching to other brands of cocoa butter (due to costs), the results have been crusty and dry for my homemade lotions. This brand however is everything I expect in a cocoa butter and produces excellent homemade products. We use it in body wash, and lotions and leaves asking very nourished.</li>
    <li> smells awesome and arrival was prompt.</li>
    <li> Smells great.  Works great in my products</li>
    <li> Love the smell of the cocoa butter!  I keep a ball of it in the shower!</li>
    <li> Smelled so good I wanted to eat it. Really creamy product. You could use it right out the bag as a lotion bar. Very moisturizing. I used it as an ingredient in my homemade deodorant. Will order again :)</li>
    <li> great product and very helpful seller!</li>
    <li> Smells like chocolate! It&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
    <li> This is a great product to use.</li>
    <li> I melted it the microwave with some olive oil ,  little chocolate food flavoring and some water .  Fantastic moisturizer, helps to prevent signs if aging.  Love the smell</li>
    <li> Love this cocoa butter. Smells just like chocolate. Very good quality. Aspen Naturals also emailed me a great recipe for body butter too!</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE this product!</li>
    <li> Great product. Food grade cocoa butter is like magic. It was tasty and made great homemade skin products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is natural and not deodorized. Strong chocolate scent so beware if you  buy to make skin products. You wont be able to mask it.</li>
    <li> AMAZING, will be repurchasing soon. The scent was strong like rich dark chocolate, mixable but hard to cut and applied well. It was more than what I expected for my first online cocoa butter purchase which was a risk for me. BUT I LOVE THIS COCOA BUTTER. So worth it.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite cocoa butter so far. The packaging is well thought out. The whole pound is in a single large bar so it didn&#x27;t melt in shipping. They also put it in a generic but very effective foil pouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taste is as expected. I will be buying this brand from now on.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and fresh but wow does it really have a strong smell! Not to fond of it at all!</li>
    <li> I have used this product to make candies, and it is delicious. I&#x27;m getting ready to use it to make some lotion, and I&#x27;m confident that it will be a superior product for that as well.</li>
    <li> Love it! Smells AMAZING! Used some to make lotion bars so far.</li>
    <li> Sells and looks great. Good quality, would buy again... Was a tad pricey but in all fairness anywhere I look its pricey if it&#x27;s quality!</li>
    <li> High quality.  Buy it, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> My favorite cocoa butter. Smells delicious. I use it in all my DIY products.</li>
    <li> Good quality, a bit difficult to soften but easy enough to use. Although if using for food preparation with precise measurements I recommend getting a food scale to portion correctly because unlike regular butter there are not any marked measurements.</li>
    <li> Really nice cocoa butter. Smells soooo good! I&#x27;m using it in hand made lotions and creams and it really makes them smooth and moisturizing on the skin.</li>
    <li> I returned it because what I received was NOT ORGANIC</li>
    <li> This Cocoa butter smells awesome and appears to be very fresh! I look forward to trying in my next batch of body butter! Fast shipping. Product just as described. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Came in block/ brick form. Had the strong and real scent of pure cocoa butter and i love that fact. Took some time to melt down though. Even if you leave it in room temp for a while. However, it works great on my skin and hair when i mixed with my shea butter mixture for my natural hair, my body butter, and chapstick i made!</li>
    <li> Made body butter w this!  The quality is so amazing my daughter and I were snacking on it too!  Great service too!</li>
