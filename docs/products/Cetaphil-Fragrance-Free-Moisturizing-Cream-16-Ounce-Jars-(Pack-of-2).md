### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I searched for it on Amazon.com because where I used to purchase it raised its price $5.00 a jar!!!!I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
      <li>This is the best skin care cream out there</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
      <li>It is probably the best moisturizer I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>It felt very good on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>--it&#x27;s that good!</li>
      <li>He was happy though.</li>
      <li>Cetaphil cream (in the jar) was recommended to me by a well respected NY dermatologist who has her own skin care line!</li>
      <li>I used this cream when it was in the aqua colored label and it was good on my skin</li>
      <li>, so I hope it still is as good as it used to be.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>It has worked wonderfully helping her skin look and feel so much healthier.  </li>
      <li>I heard so many good things about it.</li>
      <li>They liked it a lot &#x27;coz</li>
      <li>I think Cetaphil Fragrance Free Moisturizing Cream is superior to Kiehl&#x27;s Creme de Corps, and it certainly is a better price performer.</li>
      <li>and I love it</li>
      <li>I also love the fact that it has no fragrance and leaves no sticky feeling.</li>
      <li>It has been a lifesaver for us, we love it.</li>
      <li>and I have tried MANY.</li>
      <li>My favorite body lotion before using cetaphil was aveeno.</li>
      <li>Yes it is very rich and keeps that moisture throughout the day</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone, from people who just want good lotion to those with skin conditions (e.g. psoriasis, eczema).</li>
      <li>the company changed its formulation to a less wonderful cream, without indicating this to customers.</li>
      <li>I even use a light coat on my face before applying makeup.  </li>
      <li>Cetaphil Cream (not lotion) is far superior.  </li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s super easy to control the amount of product</li>
      <li>I used the original Cetaphil moisturizing fragrance cream for years, in the 20 oz.</li>
      <li>2 containers is perfect because I went through the first one in a little over a month.</li>
      <li>and you don&#x27;t have a pump stem full of cream...</li>
      <li>This is my favorite as far as protection and application.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Aveeno with some success, since it&#x27;s unscented, as is this.</li>
      <li>It has a very neutral smell and does not at all feel greasy and it absorbs quickly.  </li>
      <li>Certainly better than dry skin.</li>
      <li>but somehow it wasnt really helping me with flakiness</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>It left it soothed and smooth feeling.</li>
      <li>It has a really nice thick consistency, which scared me at first.</li>
      <li>I found the main advantage in this as opposed to Aveeno</li>
      <li>and I have very sensitive skin!</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this cream to all for adults as well as kids.</li>
      <li>I strongly recommend this product to who ever is a sufferer from chronic dry, sensitive skin (like I&#x27;m).</li>
      <li>I smooth it on in the morning and find that at the end of the day my skin is still very soft and not at all dry.</li>
      <li>If you have very sensitive skin like I do, try this product.</li>
      <li>Cetaphil made them go away completely!</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and my legs get irritated from shaving.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice because I can use it all the time without getting tired of an overpowering scent.</li>
      <li>The older product contained glyceryl as the second ingredient, after water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I just started using it under my eyes instead of my expensive under eye cream, and I swear it&#x27;s doing a better job!</li>
      <li>Upon recommendation from our pediatrician, we began using Cetaphil cream on our 4 month old to soothe dry sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>I could only blame the harsh winter weather and frequent hot showers that I take.</li>
      <li>In addition to dry, my skin is very sensitive and allergy prone as well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only been able to find the pump bottle kind in the stores; we find that it&#x27;s hard to get the last 2 oz of cream out with the pump, and have to resort to cutting open</li>
      <li>This particular lotion helped me a lot when I was suffering from extreme dryness all over the body.</li>
      <li>I have really sensitive skin--prone to breakouts and rashes, dry and oily</li>
      <li>noticed this newer Cetaphil container, which is still labelled \\&quot;moisturizing cream for dry, sensitive skin\\&quot; but has petrolatum as the second ingredient.</li>
      <li>I noticed that Cetaphil Moisturizing Lotion had actually made me break out from some ingredient that reacted harshly to my dry sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I get extremely dry, itchy skin since I live in New England and am often outside in harsh weather.</li>

<li> This stuff will also last you a long time.</li>
<li> With other creams or lotions, I find myself constantly reapplying.  </li>
<li> I bought this because my dermatologist recommended it for my extremely dry skin on my face</li>
<li> It did improve my skin to be less flaky and my entire body doesnt feel itchy like it did before.</li>
<li> I wash my hands a lot, so it gets very dry.  </li>
<li> I get those icky red bumps on the back of my arms.</li>
<li> Be careful buying this newer product.</li>
<li> After basically using lotions a few times and then going on to the next one, I decided to try this.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t even want to know all the money I have spent on products.</li>
<li> I am sensitive to fragrances and have struggled with dry, itchy skin which gets much worse in the winter.  </li>
<li> is it&#x27;s extremely moisturizing.</li>
<li> My only complaint would be the odor.</li>
<li> Highly recommended for anyone who suffers from dry skin.  </li>
<li> as they say \\&quot;waste not, want not\\&quot;</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not at all too heavy though, or sticky and it absorbs well.</li>
<li> I also dont like to wear really heavy lotions that leave me feeling sticky.</li>
<li> If I don&#x27;t moisturize everyday</li>
<li> The consistency is creamy and not too hard like other creams.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not as pleasent to use, feels like plain petroleum jelly.</li>
<li> My husband and 2 teenage sons were also using this for their faces when they became too dry during the cold months.</li>
<li> But it wasn&#x27;t heavy and didnt leave my skin feeling sticky, at all!</li>
<li> I would still use shea butter as my facial moisturizer at night and during the cold season and petroleum jelly for my heels</li>
<li> It isn&#x27;t too thick, and it does the job.  </li>
<li> Both had a thick, gooey feel, but they kept my skin from itching</li>
<li> No more switching around and throwing 1/2 used jars away anymore!</li>
<li> That sucks!</li>
<li> Though certainly not overwhelming, this cream does have an unpleasant odor.</li>
<li> I was so disgusted by the fact that when I scratched my skin, the flakes would fall out or come off on inside of my black shirts that Im usually fond of wearing.</li>
<li> I will continue to purchase this product at Amazon until it becomes too expensive or I develope a reaction to it.</li>
<li> Dry itchy skin is painful !!  </li>
<li> but it seems to do the job and lasts throughout the day without any unpleasant feeling.</li>
<li> My daughter also uses this because of bad echema.</li>
<li> Try it you&#x27;ll like it :{}</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I strongly recommend this product to who ever is a sufferer from chronic dry, sensitive skin (like I&#x27;m). I have found that no moisturizing creams have ever come close to as Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream has. This is the only cream that I have found to improve my dry itchy skin (especially applied after a shower). I have found that even the Cetaphil Moisturizing Lotion has not even come close to the Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream. I noticed that Cetaphil Moisturizing Lotion had actually made me break out from some ingredient that reacted harshly to my dry sensitive skin. If this sounds like you give Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream a try.</li>
    <li> Cetaphil cream (in the jar) was recommended to me by a well respected NY dermatologist who has her own skin care line! I have really sensitive skin--prone to breakouts and rashes, dry and oily all at the same time. If I don&#x27;t moisturize everyday I get those icky red bumps on the back of my arms. Cetaphil made them go away completely! This is the best skin care cream out there and I have tried MANY. (Others I have tried include Lubriderm, Aveeno, Vasline Intensive Care, Olay, Dove, on and on. This beats them all!) When my skin is at its worst--itchy and reactive--I can put Cetaphil on my skin and I wouldn&#x27;t trust anything else.</li>
    <li> I finally found something to treat my eczema, etc.... I had used petroleum jelly, eucerin cream, aquaphor and organic shea butter to treat my cracked heels, hands, flaky skin, etc...... BUT NOW, Cethaphil is finally here and it works well WITHOUT being too greasy/thick/sticky. I would still use shea butter as my facial moisturizer at night and during the cold season and petroleum jelly for my heels BUT I&#x27;ll be buying this FOREVER as my daytime facial moisturizer and will replace my eucerin body lotion. My husband and 2 teenage sons were also using this for their faces when they became too dry during the cold months. They liked it a lot &#x27;coz it&#x27;s fragrance-free. It works.... so the price doesn&#x27;t matter anymore &#x27;coz the entire family benefit from it.....Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Upon recommendation from our pediatrician, we began using Cetaphil cream on our 4 month old to soothe dry sensitive skin.  It has worked wonderfully helping her skin look and feel so much healthier.  Highly recommend this cream to all for adults as well as kids.</li>
    <li> If you have very sensitive skin like I do, try this product. It&#x27;s the only thing I can use. I&#x27;m allergic or sensitive to every other product I&#x27;ve tried but this. I will continue to purchase this product at Amazon until it becomes too expensive or I develope a reaction to it. I&#x27;ve used it for two years now with no problem and I have very sensitive skin! I searched for it on Amazon.com because where I used to purchase it raised its price $5.00 a jar!!!!I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. My daughter also uses this because of bad echema. This works great-try it!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for the hubby as he constantly needs moisturizing cream for his eczema. I&#x27;ve only been able to find the pump bottle kind in the stores; we find that it&#x27;s hard to get the last 2 oz of cream out with the pump, and have to resort to cutting open the bottle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this tub, it&#x27;s super easy to control the amount of product and you don&#x27;t have a pump stem full of cream...as they say \\&quot;waste not, want not\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Dry itchy skin is painful !!  This is my favorite as far as protection and application.  The consistency is creamy and not too hard like other creams. 2 containers is perfect because I went through the first one in a little over a month. Try it you&#x27;ll like it :{}</li>
    <li> This is the only moisturizer that has worked to get rid of my baby&#x27;s eczema.  And we have tried tons!  It has been a lifesaver for us, we love it.</li>
    <li> I get extremely dry, itchy skin since I live in New England and am often outside in harsh weather. I have all kinds of lotion, and for some reason never tried Cetaphil. I bought this and it&#x27;s now the only thing I use--it&#x27;s that good! In addition to dry, my skin is very sensitive and allergy prone as well. I&#x27;ve used Aveeno with some success, since it&#x27;s unscented, as is this. I found the main advantage in this as opposed to Aveeno is it&#x27;s extremely moisturizing. I smooth it on in the morning and find that at the end of the day my skin is still very soft and not at all dry. It&#x27;s the longest-lasting lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried. It&#x27;s not at all too heavy though, or sticky and it absorbs well. It&#x27;s nice because I can use it all the time without getting tired of an overpowering scent. I would highly recommend this to anyone, from people who just want good lotion to those with skin conditions (e.g. psoriasis, eczema).</li>
    <li> I am sensitive to fragrances and have struggled with dry, itchy skin which gets much worse in the winter.  I have used, on advice of my physician, Vaseline Creamy and Eucerin.  Both had a thick, gooey feel, but they kept my skin from itching and so I used them.  Cetaphil Cream (not lotion) is far superior.  It isn&#x27;t too thick, and it does the job.  Highly recommended for anyone who suffers from dry skin.  I even use a light coat on my face before applying makeup.  It&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
    <li> I bought this because my dermatologist recommended it for my extremely dry skin on my face and I love it, I use it all over.  It is probably the best moisturizer I have ever used.  It has a very neutral smell and does not at all feel greasy and it absorbs quickly.  I WILL be buying this again and again!</li>
    <li> MY husband used this and wanted it. Thank you but I can&#x27;t say because I don&#x27;t know. He was happy though.</li>
    <li> I think Cetaphil Fragrance Free Moisturizing Cream is superior to Kiehl&#x27;s Creme de Corps, and it certainly is a better price performer.</li>
    <li> I have tried tons and tons of different moisturizers. I don&#x27;t even want to know all the money I have spent on products. I have sensitive skin and my legs get irritated from shaving. I also dont like to wear really heavy lotions that leave me feeling sticky. After basically using lotions a few times and then going on to the next one, I decided to try this. I heard so many good things about it. It has a really nice thick consistency, which scared me at first. But it wasn&#x27;t heavy and didnt leave my skin feeling sticky, at all! It left it soothed and smooth feeling. I just started using it under my eyes instead of my expensive under eye cream, and I swear it&#x27;s doing a better job! This stuff will also last you a long time. No more switching around and throwing 1/2 used jars away anymore! I found a keeper.</li>
    <li> I have used Cetaphil cream for years, and it&#x27;s the only thing that&#x27;s keeps my body moisturized.  I wash my hands a lot, so it gets very dry.  With other creams or lotions, I find myself constantly reapplying.  But with Cetaphil cream, my hands feel instantly moisturized and I do not have to reapply until my next wash.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Be careful buying this newer product. I used the original Cetaphil moisturizing fragrance cream for years, in the 20 oz. container with aqua colored label. It felt very good on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed this newer Cetaphil container, which is still labelled \\&quot;moisturizing cream for dry, sensitive skin\\&quot; but has petrolatum as the second ingredient. It&#x27;s not as pleasent to use, feels like plain petroleum jelly. The older product contained glyceryl as the second ingredient, after water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the company changed its formulation to a less wonderful cream, without indicating this to customers. That sucks!</li>
    <li> I used this cream when it was in the aqua colored label and it was good on my skin no problems, I jut purchased this one at Amazon.com and It looks like it&#x27;s cheaper on Amazon than anywhere else, so I hope it still is as good as it used to be.</li>
    <li> Though certainly not overwhelming, this cream does have an unpleasant odor. Once applied I eventually stopped noticing the smell. I&#x27;m not an expert on moisturizers but it seems to do the job and lasts throughout the day without any unpleasant feeling. Certainly better than dry skin. My only complaint would be the odor.</li>
    <li> This particular lotion helped me a lot when I was suffering from extreme dryness all over the body. I was at one point where my skin was literally flaking out. I was so disgusted by the fact that when I scratched my skin, the flakes would fall out or come off on inside of my black shirts that Im usually fond of wearing. I could only blame the harsh winter weather and frequent hot showers that I take. My favorite body lotion before using cetaphil was aveeno. Yes it is very rich and keeps that moisture throughout the day but somehow it wasnt really helping me with flakiness and I did not like the sticky feeling. I went to my local CVS and bought this for about $15. It did improve my skin to be less flaky and my entire body doesnt feel itchy like it did before. I also love the fact that it has no fragrance and leaves no sticky feeling.</li>
