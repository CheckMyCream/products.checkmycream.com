      <li>Smells really good, fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>The bottle is a nice size to fit in your shower, but I did have a bit of trouble getting the pump to unscrew, once I did it worked perfectly.</li>
      <li>This is a good, basic body wash - light and refreshing, with a nice scent.  </li>
      <li>Pump dispensers can make it easy to overuse a product.  </li>
      <li>The pump is easy to dispense and use.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Its like a spa in a bottle: clean and refreshing with no build up or residue.</li>
      <li>The scent is strong when you use it, but it does not persist as strongly once you leave the shower.</li>
      <li>Rainbath has a strong fragrance.</li>
      <li>I found the fragrance on the strong side (flowery) in the bottle</li>
      <li>But if you can live with that, it is a good performer.</li>
      <li>This product of fine.  </li>
      <li>And it works fine as a soap.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It had a light lather and rinsed off easily.</li>
      <li>The scent is mild, not too perfumie (as if that was a word!).</li>
      <li>It smells fantastic.</li>
      <li>(that&#x27;s important for me).</li>
      <li>It has fantastic moisturizing properties, on a par with Philosophy&#x27;s bath gels (of which I&#x27;m a huge fan.)</li>
      <li>It is perfect for summer when you don&#x27;t want to use a heavy lotion in the summer.</li>
      <li>Overall, this is a great bath gel -- it feels good on my skin, and I feel like it gets me clean without being abrasive or causing problems with my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a quite pleasant scent, but the intensity can be pretty overpowering -- there&#x27;s still a very strong smell of it in the shower even after you&#x27;ve totally rinsed off.</li>
      <li>is so light and clean.  </li>
      <li>This wash is very lightly (and pleasantly) scented with a fresh smell without that chemical perfume stink, and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my kids&#x27; skin.</li>
      <li>I used to love Neutrogena&#x27;s clear bars for washing my face (too drying for my skin now), and fans of Neutrogena will love this.</li>
      <li>It rinses cleanly.</li>
      <li>Overall, it works okay, leaves the body nice and clean feeling...and smelling sort of ...</li>
      <li>I felt clean after using it without dryness, however, I wouldn&#x27;t call this product moisturizing as &amp;#34;replenishing&amp;#34; implies.</li>
      <li>&quot; True?</li>
      <li>I used this after a week in vegas and it really made my skin feel better from the dryness out there.  </li>
      <li>This is not a bad product</li>
      <li>This shower gel has a fresh, clean scent that I think would appeal to either men or women.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It has a fresh, clean scent and doesn&#x27;t leave you smelling like a fruit salad or a cowboy all primped up for a Saturday night on the town.  </li>
      <li>It lathers up well and quickly - you do not need to use a lot.</li>
      <li>It is really a decent shower gel, although there are way too many ingredients for me.</li>
      <li>I used Rainbath and the Rainbath Oil (I always have that on hand) for almost 30 years and stopped when the new creamier products like Olay and Dove liquid soap came on the market because they offered more moistiurizing products.  </li>
      <li>that leaves your skin dry, this is a good one to try.</li>
      <li>soap didn&#x27;t dry out my skin or leave any residue, but that&#x27;s what I would expect from any good soap.  </li>
      <li>Soaps up pretty well, so no issues there, rinses off clean.  </li>
      <li>do wish that this shower/bath gel was made of more natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It leaves your skin feeling clean and as if there&#x27;s a slight coating of something - a good feeling.</li>
      <li>This one had a distinct scent but it does not overpower or follow you around all day after you have showered.</li>
      <li>One feels fresh after each shower.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It cleans the skin and makes it healthy, soft, shiny and radiant.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
      <li>and I love most of their other products.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say that it left my skin looking \\&quot;radiant and healthy looking\\&quot; but it leaves me feeling squeaky clean without drying my skin.</li>
      <li>Great fresh scent that is not overpowering or too subtle -</li>
      <li>I am so glad they reformulated this product to add back in the moisture</li>
      <li>It actually makes my shower time more</li>
      <li>Lathers up pretty well using a body scrub brush.</li>
      <li>My skin actually feels a lot better using this than the others.  </li>
      <li>Overall it is okay.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, I only got to use it about three times before it ran out because we had lost most of it in the damage from mailing.</li>
      <li>I found I could get my entire body clean with about two partial pumps worth which makes this product both effective and affordable.  </li>
      <li>I have loved Rainbath in the past.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice to have something we can all use because that&#x27;s one less bottle hanging around in my shower.</li>
      <li>It is fresh and a tiny bit sweet.</li>
      <li>laurate.\\&quot; The Environmental Working Group website says there is \\&quot;strong evidence\\&quot; of this being a \\&quot;human skin toxicant or allergen.\\</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I received this - at no cost - as part of the Amazon Vine program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always liked Neutrogena products - this is no different! It has a lovely scent and does a great job at hydrating my skin.It does not take a lot of the gel when showering, so that makes it budget-friendly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to anyone looking for a nice, lightly scented, bath gel that moisturizes well.</li>
    <li> I hate to just give this product just three stars but i was not impressed. My question to myself is -- will I buy this again? The answer is no. It didn&#x27;t lather up well like other products. And it didn&#x27;t feel very conditioning to me. Maybe this would be perfect for someone who doesn&#x27;t deal with dry skin like myself. Also, it seemed like I had to use more -- several pumps of the product -- to get enough on the sponge. The scent is very light and fine. Overall it is okay. It does the job but not in an impressive way.</li>
    <li> I like Neutrogena products and this shower and bath gel is no exception. It lathers up well, rinses off easily and doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out my skin. I find the scent to be pleasant without being overpowering. The pump dispenser works well and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it clogging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish that this shower/bath gel was made of more natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a list of ingredients for those interested: Purified Water, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Lauramide DEA, Oleyl Betaine, Fragrance, Polysorbate No. 20, Propylene Glycol, Tetrasodium EDTA, BHT, DMDM Hydantoin, Citric Acid, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Sodium Chloride, FD&amp;C Red No. 40, FD&amp;C Yellow No. 5, FD&amp;C Blue No. 1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the time of this review, I&#x27;m unable to determine the price of this product. So, I&#x27;m basing my recommendation solely from my experience. I like this product a lot. A few of the ingredients prevent me from loving it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why this is called Ocean Mist because it smells like some kind of chemical, fruit candy.  I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;m a huge fan of the scent because it&#x27;s way too strong and too artificial smelling for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 8.5 oz bottle is small, so this body wash is definitely meant for people who use loofahs or wash cloths.  If you like to lather up your body wash in your hands, you&#x27;ll probably go through this entire bottle in two or three weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap didn&#x27;t dry out my skin or leave any residue, but that&#x27;s what I would expect from any good soap.  After I&#x27;m done with this bottle, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying this particular body wash again.</li>
    <li> I love Neutrogena Rainbath - it is so gentle and soothing on my sensitive skin. The ocean mist provides a light, pleasant scent. Definitely recommended to anyone who likes smooth, soft skin.</li>
    <li> This shower gel has a fresh, clean scent that I think would appeal to either men or women.  It left my skin feeling practically squeaky clean but soft, neither dried out nor oily.  Pump dispensers can make it easy to overuse a product.  I found I could get my entire body clean with about two partial pumps worth which makes this product both effective and affordable.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I was holding off buying a bodywash for myself because I knew I had this one coming. I ran out of my regular bodywash a few days ago and while I don&#x27;t mind smelling like Old Spice body wash, I was pretty grateful when this item came in. The dispenser was a little loose so in transit, it did leak but that&#x27;s pretty much the only complaint that I have. Otherwise, it is another solid product from Neutrogena. The smell is a bit too feminine for my son to use but I like it and it rinses well which is the main thing for me. Another plus is that a little goes a long way. Use a squirt and a half with a Japanese style bathing cloth and I got lots of suds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely putting this on my &#x27;watch for&#x27; list.</li>
    <li> This &amp;#34;Ocean Mist&amp;#34; bath gel is pretty good. It leaves your skin feeling clean and as if there&#x27;s a slight coating of something - a good feeling. The smell too is pretty good. And not too strong.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;d recommend trying this out.</li>
    <li> Neutrogena makes great stuff, and this bath gel is no exception. Absolutely light, lovely scent! It has fantastic moisturizing properties, on a par with Philosophy&#x27;s bath gels (of which I&#x27;m a huge fan.) Needless to say, the Neutrogena is a lot cheaper, if you don&#x27;t catch the Philosophy bath gels on sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of which, this is much more economical in the larger bottle, and probably cheaper yet at your local supermarket or drugstore (hint, hint.)</li>
    <li> Product arrived crushed in the envelope and half of the liquid was coating the outside of the bottle.  Horrible way of shipping -- a slightly padded envelope was not the smart way. It did smell lovely and did the job intended. Unfortunately, I only got to use it about three times before it ran out because we had lost most of it in the damage from mailing.</li>
    <li> Nice clean scent, not too over-powering. This won&#x27;t interfere with any other scents you might be applying after shower.  Good sized bottle.  Skin felt pretty good after use.  I wouldn&#x27;t say that this product was life changing, I mean this is after all just bath gel- but Neutrogena is a product that I feel like I can trust.</li>
    <li> Smells really good, fresh and clean. It doesn&#x27;t dry your skin either. I used this after a week in vegas and it really made my skin feel better from the dryness out there.  The bottle is a nice size to fit in your shower, but I did have a bit of trouble getting the pump to unscrew, once I did it worked perfectly.</li>
    <li> Does not leave your skin dry after use. I am not a person that typically likes scented soaps and body washes. This one had a distinct scent but it does not overpower or follow you around all day after you have showered. Lathers up pretty well using a body scrub brush.</li>
    <li> I trust Neutrogena products and Rainbath Replenishing Ocean Mist does not disappoint. Its like a spa in a bottle: clean and refreshing with no build up or residue. Lathers well and I get the same results using a loofa or a cloth to bathe. Great fresh scent that is not overpowering or too subtle - how can you not like the smell of the ocean?. Its a little pricey but for a spa feeling where ever you are, I strongly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Since past many years, I have been a fan of Neutrogena and use their various face wash products. I got this shower get to try out.&lt;br /&gt;Some of the features are as follows:-&lt;br /&gt;1) The fragrance is of fruit (apple and pear) that is nice and refreshing. One feels fresh after each shower.&lt;br /&gt;2) It cleans the skin and makes it healthy, soft, shiny and radiant.&lt;br /&gt;3) It is thin, non-greasy and does not leave any stickiness to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;4) The pump is easy to dispense and use.&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:-&lt;br /&gt;It is addictive and mesmerizes the senses.</li>
    <li> This product of fine.  Fragrance is okay  not a favorite, but that&#x27;s a taste issue.  I did have trouble getting the pump to work properly which is kind of a pain while your standing under a shower of water.  Soaps up pretty well, so no issues there, rinses off clean.  If you like the fragrance, and the small size isn&#x27;t intimidating, go for it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena&#x27;s transparent soap almost since I&#x27;ve had a face and I love most of their other products. This body wash is no exception. I can&#x27;t say that it left my skin looking \\&quot;radiant and healthy looking\\&quot; but it leaves me feeling squeaky clean without drying my skin. It takes a little over a teaspoon on a shower puff to work up nice suds. I have \\&quot;soft\\&quot; water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a fresh, clean scent and doesn&#x27;t leave you smelling like a fruit salad or a cowboy all primped up for a Saturday night on the town.  Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> There is a lot I like about this body wash. It smells great! The scent is strong when you use it, but it does not persist as strongly once you leave the shower. It lathers up well and quickly - you do not need to use a lot. It doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out the skin much. Of course it is humid summertime where I live, so who knows how it would do in dry wintertime! My only issue with the product is the ingredients list has a lot of chemicals - some of which are suspected of being potentially health risks (such as controversial BHT). But if you can live with that, it is a good performer.</li>
    <li> I used Rainbath and the Rainbath Oil (I always have that on hand) for almost 30 years and stopped when the new creamier products like Olay and Dove liquid soap came on the market because they offered more moistiurizing products.  This new rainbath leaves my skin just as soft as the heavier products and the scent is so light and clean.  My skin actually feels a lot better using this than the others.  I have super dry and sensitve skin which is always why I picked the Neutrogena brand in the past.  I am so glad they reformulated this product to add back in the moisture my skin is missing.</li>
    <li> My wife is a wash cloth and gel shower person but she balked at trying this at first because she didn&#x27;t like the blue color. No other reason since we both like Neutrogena products. When she finally did, the verdict was positive. Lathers up well - actually, very well. The scent is mild, not too perfumie (as if that was a word!). The best part, unlike some shower gels, this one rinses away easily and leaves skin feeling moist, not dry. Really, if you have a product (I usually wash with bar soap) that leaves your skin dry, this is a good one to try. I showered with it before my wife tried it and reserved any comments so as to not prejudice her review. She concurred on everything I experienced but singled out the moist feel on the skin as what she liked the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great company. Good lather. Pleasant scent. Leaves skin feelin moist. Could be 5 stars if my wife liked the color. She says it looks like the liquid they keep combs in at the barber shop!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s say 4 1/2 to keep peace in the family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
    <li> The bottles came leaking and were half empty. I had them shipped to India and can&#x27;t even sent them back for refund as it will cost me much more to simply ship it back.</li>
    <li> When I take a shower, I want something that isn&#x27;t too smelly  and cleans without leaving a feeling that there is residue on me.  The Neutrogena Rainbath Replenishing Ocean Mist Shower and Bath gel is works okay.  I used very little, maybe four squirts out of the bottle on my washcloth.  It lathered up nicely and rinsed off well, leaving a slippery clean feeling on my body.  The smell.....well...that&#x27;s the issue. I don&#x27;t like a lot of smells that companies say are &amp;#34;ocean&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Forest&amp;#34;.  This smells like that green apple smell, not &amp;#34;ocean&amp;#34;.  But that&#x27;s me.  It is really a decent shower gel, although there are way too many ingredients for me. Since I usually use a Castille soap, I am used to pure and very little smell. I highly suggest smelling this at a store before you get the Amazon-type deal for it.  Overall, it works okay, leaves the body nice and clean feeling...and smelling sort of ...well..you decide!</li>
    <li> My skin is sensitive and I also get headache if the scent is too artificial. So, I&#x27;m usually very careful about fragrance. Neutrogena Ocean Mist&#x27;s scent is subtle and nice. It actually makes my shower time more pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t make your skin dry and doesn&#x27;t leave strong scent (that&#x27;s important for me). Overall, it&#x27;s a perfect product for me!</li>
    <li> Caveats up front, this is a subjective review based solely on personal preference.  If I were to opt for a liquid body wash cor the shower, I much prefer any of the Aveeno products.  The &#x27;clean&#x27; feels exactly the same, less product is required, and is smells less unnatural.  I still opt for Dove sensitive skin bar soap, however, as the cost is a fraction of body washes, and I am not concerned with using it to wash my face.  This is not a bad product and I certainly did not experience any negative effects, it is just not my preferred method of washing up.</li>
    <li> I have loved Rainbath in the past. Neutrogena has been mostly a great brand for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Neutrogena Rainbath Replenishing Ocean Mist is wonderful. It isn&#x27;t a lather as much as a creamy suds. It smells fantastic. It is probably a little feminine. But it is not floral. It is fresh and a tiny bit sweet. I would buy any product with this scent. I just loved it. It lasts nicely without being overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was nice and creamy in our hard water. It rinses cleanly. It smells nicely. But it leaves my skin moisturized and soft. It is perfect for summer when you don&#x27;t want to use a heavy lotion in the summer.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s called a bath gel, but I used it as regular soap. It contains \\&quot;sodium laureth sulfate\\&quot; which is found in many soaps. So it&#x27;s a soap. And it works fine as a soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also has \\&quot;sodium chloride,\\&quot; a water softener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of greater concern is that it contains \\&quot;PEG-80 sorbitan laurate.\\&quot; The Environmental Working Group website says there is \\&quot;strong evidence\\&quot; of this being a \\&quot;human skin toxicant or allergen.\\&quot; True? I don&#x27;t know. My skin didn&#x27;t react negatively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Rainbath has a strong fragrance. Not horrible, but stronger then I&#x27;d like. Actually, I prefer no fragrance. And no coloring, which I find unnecessary. This Rainbath contains Blue 1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a slightly oily feel. I guess that&#x27;s to soften your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A decent soap, if you don&#x27;t mind the fragrance and other chemicals.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice body wash suitable for both adults and children. I am sensitive to fragrances and my kids have sensitive skin. This wash is very lightly (and pleasantly) scented with a fresh smell without that chemical perfume stink, and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my kids&#x27; skin. It&#x27;s nice to have something we can all use because that&#x27;s one less bottle hanging around in my shower.</li>
    <li> Overall, this is a great bath gel -- it feels good on my skin, and I feel like it gets me clean without being abrasive or causing problems with my sensitive skin. I like that it foams a little, but not in that over the top way that some bath/shower gels can, since seems to make it harder to get completely rinsed off. And compared to some of the other neuotrgena bath/shower products I&#x27;ve used, I really like that this one doesn&#x27;t leave a slippery residue on the floor of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that keeps this from being a 5-star product for me is the scent. It&#x27;s a quite pleasant scent, but the intensity can be pretty overpowering -- there&#x27;s still a very strong smell of it in the shower even after you&#x27;ve totally rinsed off.</li>
    <li> This is a good, basic body wash - light and refreshing, with a nice scent.  Good for springtime!</li>
    <li> This is the second type of Neutrogena Rainbath I have used.  The first was a gold color with a different scent.  Like that wash, this is also a nice product.  I like the way it leaves my skin feeling after I&#x27;ve used it and it has a pleasant fragrance, at least it does to my nose.  The reason I rated it a 4 rather than a 5 star product is that I do not think it lathers well enough.  So, I have to use more product and more effort to get a good sudsing for a shower.  Not the biggest factor, but it is a convenience and cost issue.  Also, I did experiment with using it as a shaving cream and while it did work pretty well, it&#x27;s not nearly as effective as the Cerave product I normally use.</li>
    <li> Neutrogena&#x27;s signature clear, low key packaging that set it apart as &amp;#34;natural,&amp;#34; for sensitive skin and good quality with their original products, although this gel is most definitely not a natural product. It had a light lather and rinsed off easily. I found the fragrance on the strong side (flowery) in the bottle but it was ok after a shower. I felt clean after using it without dryness, however, I wouldn&#x27;t call this product moisturizing as &amp;#34;replenishing&amp;#34; implies. I used to love Neutrogena&#x27;s clear bars for washing my face (too drying for my skin now), and fans of Neutrogena will love this.</li>
