      <li>Really like the smell.</li>
      <li>Nioxin products work very well on my hair.</li>
      <li>This is a great product that really adds volume and manageability to my thin hair.</li>
      <li>okay, lightweight so it does not weight my hair down.</li>
      <li>Holds up in high humidity (Florida).</li>
      <li>For example, when using a flatiron on my hair it made indentations in my hair because this product made my hair very dry and would not let the flatiron glide smoothly.</li>
      <li>:) I&#x27;ve been using the Nioxin Shampoo and Conditioner 4 for a few months and am beginning to see new hair growth</li>
      <li>I have fine thin hair and have a cabinet full of hair products.  </li>
      <li>whole right side from front to back has been bald for last 15 years, my beautician introduced me to Nioxon</li>
      <li>Only reason I am giving this 3 stars is because it did seem to add a little bit more volume.</li>
      <li>Works great--thickens hair markedly yet no &amp;#34;odd&amp;#34; feel to hair.</li>
      <li>So far it seems to be doing what it is advertised to do which is thicken hair and help with growth.</li>
      <li>I have tried so many products for my thin hair, and this really works.  </li>
      <li>I have very fine and thin hair, so I&#x27;ve tried lots of products to make my hair feel and look like it has some body.&lt;br /&gt;Been</li>
      <li>The main ingredient in this is &amp;#34;chitosan&amp;#34; which is crushed up seashells (chitosan is also used as a calcium supplement &amp; for weight loss - same concept.</li>
      <li>so it does not take much to weigh it down....</li>
      <li>With my fine and thin hair, this makes it possible to have a fuller look.</li>
      <li>little bit goes a long way with this product so when you first try it, don&#x27;t over-use</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Worst product ever wish I could return it .</li>
    <li> Does not do what they promise. Not good.</li>
    <li> It makes my hair appear fuller and thicker.  Use it very sparingly.  If you use too much it could be a little gummy but you quickly learn how much is good for you.  My hair is very fine so it does not take much to weigh it down....I rec&#x27;d compliments the very first time I used it.</li>
    <li> I like all the Nioxin products and this one is as good.</li>
    <li> This thickening spray is a-ma-zing! My hair has thinned on the crown only - &amp;#34;only&amp;#34; as in only the worst possible place it COULD thin, ugh - due to an ongoing illness. Since my hair is long, I wear it up with combs or clips. This spray really helps give my baby-fine hair the thickness to stay up. I don&#x27;t use it as a comb-through product, I have other stuff I prefer for that. But when my hair has dried and I&#x27;m ready to put it up, I flip my hair over, spray it with the Nioxin spray, hit it with a diffused dryer, and voila! Instant Gibson girl. :) I&#x27;ve been using the Nioxin Shampoo and Conditioner 4 for a few months and am beginning to see new hair growth already - yay! I just added this spray and the Bodifying Foam to my hair-care regimen - I am definitely a fan of Nioxin products.</li>
    <li> Works really.  The trick is to not overuse the amount I  apply, as this will leave my hair dull and a little stiff.  However, now that I&#x27;ve sorted that out, I love it for my fine hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using this almost religiously now and I really like the way it makes my hair feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little bit goes a long way with this product so when you first try it, don&#x27;t over-use or you will likely be unhappy. It&#x27;s basically a learning curve with this but definitely start out using just a few sprays and work it in to the roots really well.</li>
    <li> This is a temporary thickener - not a hair regrowth system. That said, I really love the product. I don&#x27;t have hair loss, just very fine curly hair. When I straighten my hair, it loses all volume &amp; just lies flat and doesn&#x27;t hold any style.&lt;br /&gt;This product really does add volume - and makes the hair plump up, mimicking thicker hair. My hair even feels thicker when I put it in a pony tail.  The main ingredient in this is &amp;#34;chitosan&amp;#34; which is crushed up seashells (chitosan is also used as a calcium supplement &amp; for weight loss - same concept. It makes the stomach feel fuller).&lt;br /&gt;Basically, this product goes into the hair shaft &amp; gets absorbed, like a sponge, in the hair - causing a temporary thickening.&lt;br /&gt;I use to use Revlon&#x27;s &amp;#34;Top Brass&amp;#34; which did the same thing - till they discontinued it. So I&#x27;m thrilled I&#x27;ve found another hair thickener that really does plump up the hair - with no residue. It also builds up a little bit - so after the 2nd day of using it, you&#x27;ll notice more improvement.&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff! and Amazon seems to have the best price!</li>
    <li> contains methylparaben. won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
    <li> It is giving my baby fine hair some much needed body.</li>
    <li> This product made my hair feel like straw. I used it per the directions the first time and my hair felt very dirty after using it. It made my hair hard to work with. For example, when using a flatiron on my hair it made indentations in my hair because this product made my hair very dry and would not let the flatiron glide smoothly. After this I experimented with using different amounts. Even when using a very small amount it did the same thing. Only reason I am giving this 3 stars is because it did seem to add a little bit more volume.</li>
    <li> Nioxin products work very well on my hair.</li>
    <li> This products does seem to be helping to thicken my hair. The salon where I used to get it quit carrying it , so thankfully, someone suggested trying on here. Thanks a bunch!!</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and it helps with styling.</li>
    <li> Works pretty good for my sister.</li>
    <li> Did nothing for my hair.</li>
    <li> The Nioxin work well for my hair and I am very pleased with it. I would recommend it to everyone to at least try it.</li>
    <li> Works well, no build up and promotes less hair loss. Would recommend to friends. I will definitely buy again when I need more.</li>
    <li> I am using it daily.  It appears to be workin.  Use on daily and seems to be doing it job.</li>
    <li> Gives my hair the little extra body and fullness it needs.  This is one of the best hair products I have ever used, and I have tried many!</li>
    <li> I have very fine and thin hair, so I&#x27;ve tried lots of products to make my hair feel and look like it has some body.&lt;br /&gt;Been using the Nioxin Thickening Spray and the Nioxin Root Lifter for years.  I use the Thickening Spray for special occasions.  (Don&#x27;t use too much of this one - just a light spray).  They&#x27;re the best.  No sticky residue.  Holds up in high humidity (Florida).</li>
    <li> works okay, lightweight so it does not weight my hair down.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Like this product. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Great product with the combo of Nioxin thinkinen hair spray! I actually been using this product for the last two months and I have already grown a lot of hair on my bald spot. I recommend this product to everyone. I am true witness it works.&lt;br /&gt;My whole right side from front to back has been bald for last 15 years, my beautician introduced me to Nioxon and I can not thank her enough because after all these years my hair is finally growing back!! 😉For the right price I will send a before and after photo... Too embarrass to do it it for Free! But I will continue to use the product!!</li>
    <li> Nioxin&#x27;s Thickening Hair Spray is excellent. Light and perfect for fine hair. Use it before you dry your hair and after. Really helps to give your hair body and to stay in place without feeling like shellac!</li>
    <li> I have been using his product for 7 months, one can lasted that long. My hair is short, curly and thinning on top. This spray makes it look like I have hair. I also usw Nexim cleaner (shampoo &amp; conditioner) $ but it is working and I have not purchased more ince Dec. Only need small amount, penny size. My dermatologist says it&#x27;s all I need.</li>
    <li> this is a great product.  I have fine thin hair and have a cabinet full of hair products.  This is one of the best ones that I have purchased.  I actually ordered 3 bottles, just in case.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It gives my hair style without heaviness.  This and Freeze It hair spray is all I need.</li>
    <li> Seems like water with a light scent. I&#x27;ve used this product before via purchase from my hairdresser but found it cheaper here. It&#x27;s not the same. This did not add add any body to my hair and was if I just dried my hair after having washed it. Disappointing and unfortunately I didn&#x27;t read the return policy before hand so once you open it, you can&#x27;t return it.</li>
    <li> I really can&#x27;t believe what a difference this product has made.  My hair actually seems to have gotten thicker and healthier.</li>
    <li> Made hair visibly thicker!</li>
    <li> My mom is very happy with this product. If she&#x27;s happy I&#x27;m happy. It&#x27;s helped her hair grow back. And my edges. Great product.</li>
    <li> Nice product and it works as expected.</li>
    <li> I am really pleased with this Hair Spray for all the same reasons others have stated.  It has a really great scent, too!</li>
    <li> This product is my wife favorite hair product, we can not find this product here in Prescott, Arizona we would have to drive a 100 miles to Phoenix to find a retail outlet. we will be doing a repeat order for sure !!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Fantastic product!  Does exactly as advertised...</li>
    <li> I have tried so many products for my thin hair, and this really works.  I spray it all over, and style as usual.  Not sticky or thick.  Really works.</li>
    <li> Long lasting hold. Makes hair fuller. Will be ordering this product again.</li>
    <li> I did not like this spray at all. It did nothing to make my hair look fuller, only made it look dirty.</li>
    <li> Anyone with thinning hair, speaking from a woman&#x27;s perspective, you can&#x27;t beat Nioxin Thickening Hair Spray.  I was  delighted with the results and my hair operator was speechless.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> love it , great product for hair.</li>
    <li> Works great--thickens hair markedly yet no &amp;#34;odd&amp;#34; feel to hair. Have recommended to three friends/acquaint enhances who noticed my hair</li>
    <li> Really like the smell. Holds fairly well. Makes my hair feel thicker. Kinda pricey tho.</li>
    <li> Love the product. It helps my thin hair look full.</li>
    <li> I love how this stuff makes my thin flat hair full of body and better able to hold a curl when I want to dress up.</li>
    <li> I was so glad I could find this through Amazon.  With my fine and thin hair, this makes it possible to have a fuller look.</li>
    <li> I like this product but it can tend to cause staticy hair.  You have to be careful not to spray it on the ends of your hair.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this brand of products so far. So far it seems to be doing what it is advertised to do which is thicken hair and help with growth.</li>
    <li> Been using it for years. Works very well on my soft, fine hair. It is very light and comes out in a fine mist which makes it easy to control the quantity you put on your hair.</li>
    <li> Not a good hold at all</li>
    <li> Great product, I will never change it .</li>
    <li> This is a great product that really adds volume and manageability to my thin hair.</li>
    <li> I think it makes my hair fuller and protects it when using the hair dryer.</li>
    <li> I love how it feels. I will not go with out it.</li>
    <li> I like all the Nioxin products but didn&#x27;t realize this was a liquid spray instead of the usual mist, which I prefer. Liquids are too heavy for my very thin hair.</li>
    <li> Does not work as well as the product recipe before. Why do they feel they need to keep improving things. The old product worked great!</li>
    <li> Helps set the curl in my hair! Thanks.</li>
