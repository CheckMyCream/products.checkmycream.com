<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Pigments aren&#x27;t strong enough in mine... Sucks 😠</li>
    <li> love the way it looks,  and the shipping was very fast</li>
    <li> I like the color, it took long time to came....all the color are chipped and case bend.</li>
    <li> This product did not do anything for me.  I had to apply so much to get the slightest pigmentation.  Not buttery or smooth, very powdery and difficult to apply.  I was so underwhelmed by this product and was expecting more.  Save your money for something better quality.  Just very MEH.</li>
    <li> Very pigmented, more than I thought it would be which is a plus. Price is good too considering it comes from England. Will be purchasing the others to try out to.</li>
    <li> Very nice palette with lovely colors.</li>
    <li> Omg I ordered 3 one for the other two gifts. Shipping was a week the packaging intact the colors are dupes for urban decay. Love it great price I got one for each of my daughters maybe I can keep mine</li>
    <li> Great! Fast service and product was as described.</li>
    <li> Cheap price..same as urban decay pallet</li>
    <li> The shadows are nice. Pretty colors, nicely pigmented. But my palette was broken. The lid falls off and it&#x27;s very annoying.</li>
    <li> I bought all 3 palette and there the same quality and every like tha makes brand just this is the knock off! It&#x27;s wonderful I love it... Buy one for best friend cause she loves mine so much. Works great cause I&#x27;m a makeup artist and wanted something cheep! Definitely recommend this product</li>
    <li> It looks like an almost exact dup of my friends urban decay naked palette. Being a single mom I often can&#x27;t afford expensive make-up for myself, this product is amazing and it makes me feel like i&#x27;ve splurged when I really haven&#x27;t. Love this item!</li>
    <li> My husband got this former for Christmas,army request and I Love it!  I use it every day.</li>
    <li> This palette is AMAZING! I love the texture of the eyeshadows, it goes on and looks just as expected. Many eyeshadows I have used before don&#x27;t have much pigment and once applied, do not look true to color at all. This is not the case with w7! This is the first w7 palette I have bought, and I have already ordered a second one! I HIGHLY recommend this. This particular one is a very close dupe to the Naked 2 palette also. And the price is unbeatable. I am so pleased.</li>
    <li> Shades dont show enough on skin</li>
    <li> Not exactly likely urban decay. Colors are very close but it takes a few extra swipes to get color to intensity of what I want. But for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> got to put on a primer not a really good dupe and the colors and not very pigmented like the naked</li>
    <li> The lighter shadows do not show up at all. Some shadows do not appear as they do in the pan, sometimes a different color altogether. An example of this is the shimmery purple shadow. It comes off as an ashy dark gray with glitters. It takes quite a bit of work to build up the pigmentation, and it&#x27;s also very powdery and sheer. Both shimmery and matte shades are disappointing. However, for the price, it&#x27;s reasonable quality but not comparable to the UD Naked3 palette. W7&#x27;s In the Buff palette is much much better quality.</li>
    <li> colors are great.  long wearing and shimmery.  i apply with petroleum jelly underneath.</li>
    <li> So far I like it.  I ordered three and two of the three had jacked up/bent metal cases.  One of them I had to return because the hinge was broken, but other than that, the actual product is fine.</li>
    <li> Came fast! Good pigmentation for the price. I was worried about it coming broken because I live in Alaska but it came perfect! Nice brush. Worth the price :)</li>
    <li> Purchased 2 -one for each of my sisters- and they absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> I love this palette! I was afraid that the colors would not be pigmented, but wow! These colors are so pigmented! I tried them with and without primer and they actually look better without the primer! I am in love with W7, I have all of the palettes minus In the Buff, that is next on my list!</li>
    <li> Amazing colors, so much cheaper than the retail stores.</li>
    <li> It truly is an amazing palette, the pigmentation is perfect. It came really fast less than a week. Buy this you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> This is a great Naked 3 by Urban Decay dupe, I love playing with this neutral palette.</li>
    <li> Matches the Naked Pallettes that are $54 each...  this is a much better deal and is almost exact in color matching</li>
    <li> i ordered this on the 4 and it came on the 11 , when it said it would take 18-20 business day , so happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Love it! As good as Naked Palettes</li>
    <li> Great alternative to the expensive Urban Decay Naked palettes! I am SO happy I found this product! I use it for everyday looks for work and also recently to a wedding. I sometimes need to reapply later in the day due to creasing, but if you use primer, it obviously helps a bunch! The colors don&#x27;t apply as smoothly as the Naked palette, but the overall value is just incomparable... I honestly don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve even used my Naked palettes since I&#x27;ve purchased this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this arrived WAY sooner that I anticipated, which was a big plus :)</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Every time I wear it I am asked if I am wearing naked brand by urban decay! My roommate fell in love and used mine everyday! I got her one as a gift and now her mom wants it! Loved it so much I bought myself a second palate with different colors. Hands down amazing.</li>
    <li> A very good palette for the price! It&#x27;s a cheaper alternative to the Naked3. Obviously you will be missing the pigmentation and buttery smoothness of that palette but it gets the job done. The colors are beautiful and go well with nearly all skin tones. I&#x27;ve created multiple looks using Naked3 tutorials and they&#x27;ve turned out great. There does seem to be a plastic film over the shadows so once you get past that, you&#x27;ll be able to pick up more of the color.&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;Dust&#x27; is probably my least favorite. It&#x27;s literally just chunks of glitter. For all the other shimmery ones, I spray my brush with water and it increases the pigmentation. I also use an eye primer to get the most out of the colors. Most of the darker shadows are pretty pigmented. &#x27;Blackheart&#x27; is probably the most pigmented. Made the mistake of wetting the brush before using that and ended up with a totally blacked out lid :/ So I suggest swatching the colors on your skin when you get it to test them out yourself before just going right ahead with creating looks.&lt;br /&gt;There is a bit of fallout w the matte shades and the case is very inconvenient not having a mirror. Not that big of a deal considering the price. I used the plastic cover it comes with to write the names of the shadows according to and corresponding with the Naked3 palette to help me follow along with tutorials. Since the inside is foam, I threw out the brush it comes with (useless) and cut a bigger opening so that I can place my eye primer in the slot. And it fits! Since the colors are neutral, I reach for this palette quite a bit for everyday looks.</li>
    <li> Very nice nude palette. I have a number of palettes that are considered dupes for the Naked Palette, and this is one of my favorites. First off, you can&#x27;t beat the price. $6, free shipping, and it comes in a solid metal tin. Very happy with the packaging; it is sturdy and pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eyeshadows go on smoothly and blend evenly. My biggest issue with this palette is that some of the lighter shades are not very pigmented and they need to be used with a primer and layered in order to achieve the look I&#x27;m going for. Still, for the price... well worth it.</li>
    <li> Love love love. Buy it now!!</li>
    <li> Shipping time was quick, tin container look awfully used - a lot of scratches and faded on the back. Makeup itself is fine. Can&#x27;t wait to try out the colors.</li>
    <li> Again came  all broke in peaces......</li>
    <li> Packaged amazing, came all in one piece. Beautiful colors that go great with all skin tones. Great shadow pallet for the money.</li>
    <li> the colors are great I love them. I received it 10 days after I ordered it.</li>
    <li> my palette was suopposed to come the 30th of July, and it came July 15th! I had no clue what came in the mail for me, and I was thrilled when it came. The palette was big, and the colors were  very pigmented. The colors were perfect, and it was just like the naked palette:)</li>
    <li> very very light colors :(</li>
    <li> I love this palette. It has a shimmer to it. It is great for a very pretty smoky eye look. I mix this and the Buff Lightly Toasted eye Colour Palette. I think they go great together.</li>
    <li> So first off this was not to be delivered to me until 08/26 and I placed the order on 07/16, I just got this yesterday in the mail as a surprise! The look of it is amazing the quality is amazing I love this product and I would definatley recommend buying this. The eyeshadow goes on so well and feels like nothing is on, the brush that is included works great also.</li>
    <li> Great price and the product has a variety of wonderful colors. The shipping speed was much faster than the estimated time.</li>
    <li> I was blown away when I received this! For the price, this is an awesome palette!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great product for the price!! Great dupe for UD and actually last like that too. Thanks for fast delivery. Will sure order again from you.</li>
    <li> Love love love ! I have both now and they are an exact dupe for Urban Decay</li>
    <li> 2nd time I&#x27;ve ordered from this seller.  Fast shipping and product was as expected.  I love and recommend it.</li>
    <li> To start, I was amazed by the speed of the shipping. The product got here much sooner than estimated. When it got here, I was definitely impressed. The colors are nearly the same as Urban Decay&#x27;s Naked 3 pallete and if anything, these colors have more pigment. The only difference in the W7 dupe and the Naked 3 is that the W7 comes in a much cheaper container and the colors are basically held in a styrofoam cutout. Also, the brush is very cheap. I&#x27;d immediately toss it and invest in a better one for better results. But for me, that&#x27;s not a big deal at all. You pay the quality you get. Overall though, the eyeshadow itself is phenomenal. I definitely recommend it since it&#x27;s $50 cheaper than the Naked 3.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these colors!!! They are great for the office, the evening or just a stroll around town!!</li>
    <li> Great shadow beautiful colors</li>
    <li> awesome palette!  i bought these because of another post saying these are really good and almost like the urban decay without the high price.  So far I like this palette because of the colors, the pigment, the price, and how i do not have to keep adding layer after layer to get the color that it looks like in the tin!  Awesome make-up..value price..I bought another colour palette &amp;#34;in the buff&amp;#34; and am also happy with that one...hopefully this brand does not go away for i plan to try out some other makeup they make</li>
    <li> I loved it . Gave it away as a christmas gift because it arrived sooner than expected! Had to reorder for myself!</li>
    <li> Just as good as the expensive stuff for less than half the money. Nobody can even tell the difference. Brand names aren&#x27;t everything, the proof is in the look.  The brush isn&#x27;t good, but I had my own. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and good protective packaging. I love the palette! It really is as good as they say! Greets from Belgium</li>
    <li> I love the colors only wish more were matte.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think I have ever gotten so attached to makeup before. I LOVE this pallet. The colors are gorgeous, and go on really, really beautifully. I ordered one for my friend as a gift... can&#x27;t wait till she gets it.</li>
    <li> I bought this palette in the shade &amp;#34;In the Buff&amp;#34; and I love it! the pigmentation is great and the shades are absolutely beautiful. My Aunt has the actual Naked 2 palette and I searched the colors side by side and they look very similar. The shadows last all day with me (while using a primer). the only downside is the packaging and shipping, when this arrived I opened it up and immediately black eyeshadow got all over me. Thankfully, the only eyeshadow that cracked was the black one, and it was only a third of it. Despite those minor flaws, I definetly recommend this gorgeous, inexpensive palette!</li>
    <li> OMG! Got it in the mail today. It&#x27;s so beautiful. The case was perfect and all the eye shadows were fine. The palete is super pretty and I&#x27;m in love. 😍🙌</li>
    <li> First positive is I received this within 6 days of ordering from out of the U.S. Second, the palette itself is beautiful. I&#x27;m so glad I found these W7 products!</li>
    <li> The eyeshadow colors are beautiful!  I already have many palettes of eyeshadows in various shades of brown and beige.  I&#x27;m glad to get something different in this palette.  The In the Nude palette contains twelve colors that are mostly warm and in the red-brown range (think rosy shades).  They are quite pigmented and bendable.  I apply it on top of a shadow primer (MAC paintpot) and have no problem with the shadows&#x27; staying power.  The packaging is a bit bulkier than I&#x27;d like, but it&#x27;ll still be good for travel.  Many looks can be created with this palette at home or on the road.  So glad I purchased this!</li>
    <li> Beautiful palette! Lovely colours and good application. The consistency is somewhat flaky (not as creamy), but still very pretty. A great dupe for Urban Decay&#x27;s Naked 3 palette!</li>
    <li> It came on time and I love how it looks on my eye&#x27;s great product plan to do more makeup shopping on Amazon</li>
    <li> Colors are true. Not as pigmented on the eyes though. Very little fallout.  For the price, you cannot beat this palette!</li>
    <li> Ill give this 2 stars. SAVE YOUR MONEY and just buy the naked pallet, the colors have terrible pigment, im only glad im out about 9 bucks.</li>
    <li> In the Nude is wonderful. I receive this with two others palette and love them. They go on great and stay on all day long.</li>
    <li> Nice colors, some are creamy and some are chalky. Unsure wether I would purchase this palette again.</li>
    <li> Very nice Palette, very similar to the UD Naked3 palette, beautiful colors!!!</li>
    <li> I have mixed feelings about this eye-shadow. First of all, I can&#x27;t get over the size. It doesn&#x27;t look big in the picture, but this thing is HUGE in real life. So big that it doesn&#x27;t even fit in my makeup case, which is a real bummer. The colors were a lot more &amp;#34;pinky&amp;#34; than I thought they would be, but still nice. Also, it seems like you really need to apply a lot of the powder for it to even show up on your skin, but that may be because I am extremely pale.</li>
    <li> what i expected but a liittle too sparsely pugmented alone</li>
    <li> This was a great purchase. Last all day and does not crease. Did not bother my sensitive skin at all.</li>
    <li> The swatches and color were just not pigmented at all. Very powdery and low quality.</li>
    <li> A good dupe for urban decay eyeshadow palette.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a nice eye shadow palette that wasn&#x27;t going to cost me $50, and this fits the bill. There is a nice selection of colors in this palette that all blend well together to create some really nice looks. This isn&#x27;t top-of-the-line eye shadow like you&#x27;d get from Urban Decay, but I believe you have to be realistic when you&#x27;re only paying a fraction of the cost. :) Overall, I think the quality is good and I&#x27;m pleased with the product. Will definitely order again!</li>
    <li> Beautiful and good quality product, recommended.</li>
    <li> Got my palette in the mail a week before the expected arrival date! I love the colors , though there is quiet a bit of fall out they are fantastic colors for a great price ! I would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I loooved it fast shipping</li>
    <li> Shipment arrived quickly, i am very happy whit the product. Good seller, my recommendarion.</li>
    <li> the shadows are very powdery and dont stay on very long but i do like the pallet just to play around in</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy the pigment on these shadows are horrible. Not worth it.</li>
    <li> Wonderful eyeshadows love the neutral tones lots of choices to play with especially for the price its very reasonable. I love it!</li>
    <li> Love the pallette  fast shipment</li>
    <li> Like everyone else has said this is a great alternative to the naked 3 palette, the only difference is this one your going to need a primer under or fix plus to intensify the pigmentation.</li>
    <li> It can&#x27;t be beat for the price.</li>
    <li> Great product, great colors, much better than spending $$$$ for high end palette.  Delivered super quick, in one week, from oversea. Impressive.</li>
    <li> I really like these eye shadows, love the light shades. I like the tin case.</li>
    <li> The colors in this are very pretty, rose gold and pink toned. All of the shades aside from the &#x27;dust&#x27; dupe (angel) are decently pigmented, they take a little building to get UD like coverage though. Scratching the surface helps them to go on more opaquely I found. The Angel shade takes some building but looks like literal fairy dust, it is incredibly glittery, I am not sure if that is how &#x27;dust&#x27; from UD comes off as I don&#x27;t own any of the Naked Palettes. Overall I would say this is a great option for those who want to experiment, the matte shades have more lasting power than the shimmer shades I&#x27;ve found, but if you have drier eyelids I can see these staying put all day with a primer.</li>
    <li> this palette actually came in one piece! packaging was horrible!!!!bought others at same time and they were beat up, shadows crushed! just got these Sat. Jan. 24, 2015. So not sure of the quality yet, colors look nice and pigmentation looks nice. So buyer beware!</li>
    <li> Very very much like the Nakeds3 Pallate — great pigment and lasts long with a primer. Glad I got this!</li>
    <li> Another unexpected treasure for the price, what nice nude colors!</li>
    <li> I had been waiting for this but I received a damaged case.. It was broken..n eye shadow popped out...I don&#x27;t know if it was from the shipping or from the storage.. I tried fixing it?.. The eye shadows themselves  are nice.. Comparable to naked 3 palette ..</li>
    <li> Great colors, beautifully pigmented....For those who don&#x27;t want to splurge on $50+ for the Urban Decay Naked palette, this is definitely the closest you can get to that without the hefty price tag.  Shipping was lightning fast as well.  GORGEOUS!</li>
    <li> I love love love these colors and eyeshadows! They blend easily.</li>
    <li> Very good palette very pigmented. Fast shipping, good quality for the price. Nothing bad about it.</li>
    <li> The colors are gorgeous and apply nicely, when it arrived though the metal box was a little banged up but no eye shadows were broken</li>
    <li> My gosh, this pallet is amazing, especially for the money! I got the &amp;#34;In the Nude&amp;#34; pallet and it&#x27;s wonderful. The colors are decently pigmented and stay for a long time (I do use a primer). Plus, the pink and brown colors in this pallet really compliment those with brown eyes. It looks really good and I love experimenting.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect! Couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
    <li> I love this pallet, very pretty colors , product was as described by seller and package arrived early. Will be buying more.</li>
    <li> Very beautiful such a good price I will definitely order again !</li>
    <li> May as well just get the Naked palette.  Quality isn&#x27;t very good, and they give you a sponge applicator.</li>
    <li> Cheap, high quality, fun.</li>
    <li> Awesome eye shadow palette!! It is a perfect dupe for the Naked 3 palette!! I am impressed with the quality and although the lid came a little damaged on the hinges I don&#x27;t mind because now the lid comes completely off which I find makes it easier to hold the palette while I use it. I would repurchase if I use this all up and I do recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I ordered this eye shadow palette hoping to create beautiful natural eye looks.  However, the colors are not very vibrant causing me to have to add multiple layers to build up the look I desire.  I would not even begin to use any shade in this case without first adding a primer. Even using a primer didn&#x27;t make these colors last long. I was also disappointed in the cheap feeling tin these shades arrive in.  Just not a good purchase in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I will be ordering more :-)</li>
    <li> Sparklier than I thought but still nice</li>
    <li> I was going to give it 4 stars because yes, the packaging is a little on the cheap side but duh! did you look at the price? LOL But on to what matters and the reason why I gave this palette 5 stars and that is the colors are amazing! Just put on a good old primer and bam, glam no need to break the bank with a Naked 3 palette that you might not even use all that often. Love it and just ordered the W7 In the Buff and can&#x27;t wait to receive it. Oh and I ordered this on July 24th and it was supposed to come in between August 20th - September 3rd and to my surprise it came in today on July 30th :-)</li>
    <li> Although the colors are comparable to the Naked 3 palette, the colors aren&#x27;t as pigmented and it takes a lot to pack on. The color payoff isn&#x27;t that great, but improves with an eyeshadow base or primer. For the price, it&#x27;s an amazing buy.</li>
    <li> Love the colors and shipped quickly. No damage.</li>
    <li> I was a little scared to order this as it was not what I am used to purchasing. But I really loved it just as much as I loved the other brands such as smash box or naked or two faced. I am so going to continue to order these products.</li>
    <li> There are some colors I&#x27;ll use more than others but I like it on a whole.  I wish some of the colors were a bit more pigmented.  The tin is cute and I&#x27;m happy to have this in my collection.</li>
    <li> Absolutely worth every cent. Amazing colors.</li>
    <li> My nieces loved these</li>
    <li> Amazing! Not the best pigment but still awesome!</li>
    <li> this palette is amazing all the colors are still intact came in really good packaging end of the really good alternative for the Naked 3 palette</li>
    <li> I am super happy to say that I am not in the least  disappointed with this eye shadow pallet!! I was worried and debated for like a month... put it in my cart... took it out... back in... back out...&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s great! The texture of them is silky smooth, they do not clump up, and I love the colors!! I do not like the brush!! It&#x27;s not my cup of tea, I just use the one from my urban decay dupe  that I got this to replace!</li>
