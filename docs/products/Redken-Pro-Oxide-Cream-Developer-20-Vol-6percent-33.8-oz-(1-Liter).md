      <li>Fast shipping and product of high quality!!!</li>
      <li>Would recommend highly!</li>
      <li>So far it seems fine and covered the grays, how long it will last is the real question.</li>
      <li>I can consistently count on this product to use with my Redken tint to cover the gray in my blonde hair.</li>
      <li>This product came in sealed much better than others I have ordered in the past - sealed up to prevent leaking and wrapped in bubble wrap.</li>
      <li>I like it works far well on my hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 5 years and has never dried out my hair.</li>
      <li>Redkin color gels Professional quality.</li>
      <li>This is the Redken developer recommended for ColorFusion and CoverFusion as well as the Redken lighteners, it has a thick, creamy consistency and is loaded with conditioners, equalizers and buffers for gentle, even, predictable results and superior hair condition.</li>
      <li>It has a thicker, richer formula than Color Gels Developer which has a more Lotion-Like consistency and would make Cream Colors too thin and runny.</li>

    <li> great to use with Redkin color gels Professional quality.</li>
    <li> Bought this for someone else so I can&#x27;t give more feedback.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t always use the same developer as the Color I use, but decided to try this. So far it seems fine and covered the grays, how long it will last is the real question.</li>
    <li> excellent developer, mixes well with color and I have had no irritation of the scalp.</li>
    <li> This product came in sealed much better than others I have ordered in the past - sealed up to prevent leaking and wrapped in bubble wrap. Nice Job.</li>
    <li> This is the Redken developer recommended for ColorFusion and CoverFusion as well as the Redken lighteners, it has a thick, creamy consistency and is loaded with conditioners, equalizers and buffers for gentle, even, predictable results and superior hair condition. It should always be the developer of choice when using ColorFusion or CoverFusion. It has a thicker, richer formula than Color Gels Developer which has a more Lotion-Like consistency and would make Cream Colors too thin and runny.</li>
