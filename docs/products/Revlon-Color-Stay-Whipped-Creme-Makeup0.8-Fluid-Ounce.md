      <li>i never tried to wear it more than 6 hours</li>
      <li>Even with having combination skin, the longer I wore it the better</li>
      <li>but it does stay with you most of the day</li>
      <li>but I still love this one</li>

      <li>I also found that the longer I wore it the better</li>
      <li>I love to try a lot of make up</li>
      <li>oh and i love that it doesnt have spf in it</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s OK.</li>
      <li>I will continue to buy if you continue to supply! :)</li>
      <li>i love how it looks on my skin ..</li>
      <li>As an international buyer, I must say that the item reached me very quickly and in perfect condition.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It’s wonderful for whenever I want full flawless and long lasting coverage.  </li>
      <li>Love the brand but this color was alil too light for me.</li>
      <li>Feels great not heavy on your skin and does not make your face shiny.</li>
      <li>This is definitely my favorite full coverage foundation.</li>
      <li>Love it so much!!</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s accurate</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light.</li>
      <li>Goes on smoothly and lasts almost all day.</li>
      <li>it goes on so smoothly my skin looks airbrushed,  &amp; I&#x27;m over 50.</li>
      <li>I need a makeup with yellow undertones and was searching for a great foundation for years.</li>
      <li>Mine is oily and this just cannot control the oiliness and is not transfer free..</li>
      <li>but i prefer the liquid ,because it is transfer free.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Absolutely fantastic product, well worth the money, I sincerely hope Revlon bring this product to England soon.</li>
      <li>My new favorite make up!</li>
      <li>I also like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have the chemical smell like the original colorstay foundation has.</li>
      <li>This foundation is FULL COVERAGE, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this if you are looking for a medium coverage</li>
      <li>and like all the reviews i watched and read , it does really look better when u leave it on ur face for a while..</li>
      <li>It is some kind of natural color.</li>
      <li>so i returned it and got the true beige instead</li>
      <li>I have yellow undertones and Warm Golden seems to be the one that mostly has this.</li>
      <li>it has full coverage and it doesn&#x27;t look cakey..</li>
      <li>It is not bad though...</li>
      <li>Compared to regular color stay foundations, this one is much more pleasant on the skin, though I would say regular ones have better coverage.</li>
      <li>The coverage this foundation gives is incredible, even with just a small amount.</li>
      <li>, I don&#x27;t feel confortanble with this kind of consistency but guess it&#x27;s fine for other people.</li>
      <li>Gosh I would really love this foundation if I could only find the right color!  </li>
      <li>The first time I used this foundation I realized I had found my HG foundation.</li>
      <li>Was repeatedly told how pretty I look.</li>
      <li>I liked this makeup very much for everyday wear.</li>
      <li>the shade is about right..it might be a bit light for me but its not a big difference than my skin tone..</li>
      <li>I really like the product, really good coverage, but when I get to the bottom of the jar, it gets too thick.  </li>
      <li>I stocked up on it,  since it always seems that when I find a makeup product that I love it gets discontinued shortly thereafter,  especially foundations.  </li>
      <li>and I think it gave me a little better coverage</li>
      <li>/&gt;It looks a little light when I first apply it</li>
      <li>I use a very loose fan brush to lightly sweep powder over it.</li>
      <li>This is my 3rd jar and still not the right shade.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend this for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>but after a few minutes it melts into my skin and warms up and just looks fantastic.</li>
      <li>, I can vouch that it looks fantastic after long periods of time with very very minimal touch ups required (if you are oily skinned).</li>
      <li>I barely feel it.</li>
      <li>Also contains salicylic acid to help prevent acne, so that&#x27;s a definite bonus, no other foundation I have tried has this component.</li>
      <li>The first few week my skin worked well with this creme, then later it irritated it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> this foundation is amazing! i love how it looks on my skin .. nice buildable coverage..the shade is about right..it might be a bit light for me but its not a big difference than my skin tone..i can work with it nicely..with bronzer and everything it will look very good..and like all the reviews i watched and read , it does really look better when u leave it on ur face for a while..i never tried to wear it more than 6 hours so i dont know if it truly stays on all day..oh and i love that it doesnt have spf in it so i dont have to worry about flash back in photos :D</li>
    <li> I liked this makeup very much for everyday wear. It says it lasts 24 hours and I&#x27;m not totally sure that&#x27;s accurate but it does stay with you most of the day</li>
    <li> I love to try a lot of make up but this is the only one I have come back to again and again.  I always buy the warm golden and tan and mix them together to get the color I like that is perfect for my skin.  This lasts all day no problem.  Feels great not heavy on your skin and does not make your face shiny.</li>
    <li> Awkwardly enough this product irritated my skin, after using it for a week. I would recommend this for sensitive skin. My skin became red and flaky. I had to reapply moisturizer on my skin. The first few week my skin worked well with this creme, then later it irritated it. Maybe it just not good for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I love this makeup, it&#x27;s perfect for my skin tone and I am even more pleased with the price! I will continue to buy if you continue to supply! :)</li>
    <li> I love love this foundation. I have yellow undertones and Warm Golden seems to be the one that mostly has this. The color almost matches my skin perfectly. Even with having combination skin, the longer I wore it the better it looked. From the reviews I&#x27;ve read, this seems to be the case for almost everyone. I like using the beauty blender to apply this foundation for a flawless look. I also like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have the chemical smell like the original colorstay foundation has.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this Revlon Color Stay Whipped Creme Makeup!  It leaves my skin looking smooth and flawless.  I was using the Revlon Color Stay Liquid foundation before and I think it gave me a little better coverage but I still love this one and I&#x27;m glad I bought it!</li>
    <li> Love the brand but this color was alil too light for me. so i returned it and got the true beige instead</li>
    <li> Wore the other day, outside. Was repeatedly told how pretty I look. Don&#x27;t know if it was this base, but didn&#x27;t hurt. Delivered in the heat, so not whipped anymore. Just a cream.</li>
    <li> I need a makeup with yellow undertones and was searching for a great foundation for years. This is department store quality at a fraction of the cost. My new favorite make up! Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> As an international buyer, I must say that the item reached me very quickly and in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is the first thing you will notice, its VERY thick. Denser than a mousse, firmer than a gel, almost as if you have hardened jelly. This foundation is FULL COVERAGE, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this if you are looking for a medium coverage product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It FULLY lives up to its long lasting claims, although I have never worn it for longer than 14 hours, I can vouch that it looks fantastic after long periods of time with very very minimal touch ups required (if you are oily skinned). Also contains salicylic acid to help prevent acne, so that&#x27;s a definite bonus, no other foundation I have tried has this component. This foundation is perfect for summer events as it wont melt off your face. Remember that the color range is different to the colorstay liquids so do beware, just look up swatches in Google before buying and compare to foundations you know match your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely fantastic product, well worth the money, I sincerely hope Revlon bring this product to England soon.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK. Very heavy wearing, thick, I don&#x27;t feel confortanble with this kind of consistency but guess it&#x27;s fine for other people. It is not bad though...</li>
    <li> This product is really amazing. It has a silky feeling to it when you are applying, something like mouse foundations have, however unlike mouse foundations, it is not cakey at all. This color is really wonderful, does not turn pinky or orange like. It is some kind of natural color. Compared to regular color stay foundations, this one is much more pleasant on the skin, though I would say regular ones have better coverage.</li>
    <li> Gosh I would really love this foundation if I could only find the right color!  This is my 3rd jar and still not the right shade.  I&#x27;m tired of trying so I will go back to BB cream.  NC35 for reference.</li>
    <li> Revlon colourstay is my favourite foundation but i prefer the liquid ,because it is transfer free.Revlon colourstay whipped is still a good foundation but i think it might be better suited for drier skin types.Mine is oily and this just cannot control the oiliness and is not transfer free..Having said that though i find the shade &amp;#34;warm golden&amp;#34; perfect for my paler winter olive complexion!</li>
    <li> Excellent service. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I really like the product, really good coverage, but when I get to the bottom of the jar, it gets too thick.  How to thin the product?</li>
    <li> nice texture, good value considering the price. Very good cover. Does not look shiny after hours of using it!</li>
    <li> this is the best foundation for my oily skin...it has full coverage and it doesn&#x27;t look cakey..Love it so much!!</li>
    <li> This is the most beautiful foundation I have ever put on. It&#x27;s light. I barely feel it. It gives great coverage with the littlest amount. It looks beautiful all day. It doesn&#x27;t rub off. I took the advice of some other reviewers and powder it with Loreal&#x27;s Translucide in Medium. So flawless without the cakey, made-up look. I apply it with a stipple brush. I use a very loose fan brush to lightly sweep powder over it. I also used the same color as the liquid formula with no problems. Would definitely recommend this foundation.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. I had heard reviews about it from many people, but I was definitely wary of using it because of my variation skin type (dry in my t-zone and oily around my nose). I&#x27;m so happy I went with my gut and tried it out! The coverage this foundation gives is incredible, even with just a small amount. I also found that the longer I wore it the better it looked. It doesn&#x27;t look cakey and leaves your skin looking even and beautiful. Definitely going to rebuy.</li>
    <li> This is my Holy Grail foundation! It’s wonderful for whenever I want full flawless and long lasting coverage.  Goes on smoothly and lasts almost all day.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this foundation I realized I had found my HG foundation. The color is perfect,  it goes on so smoothly my skin looks airbrushed,  &amp; I&#x27;m over 50. I apply it with either the Elf small stippling brush or the Real Techniques expert face brush. The color matches so well I never have a line where the color ends.  I stocked up on it,  since it always seems that when I find a makeup product that I love it gets discontinued shortly thereafter,  especially foundations.  If I have to say anything bad about it, it would be that it can feel a little sticky afterwards.</li>
    <li> Like it but it&#x27;s a little heavy on the face and would recommend it for dry to normal skin type but not oily like me.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll try another revlon formula as i like their yellow base color.</li>
    <li> This is definitely my favorite full coverage foundation. I love the texture. The packaging is gorgeous (I personally don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s bulky or whatever).&lt;br /&gt;It looks a little light when I first apply it but after a few minutes it melts into my skin and warms up and just looks fantastic. It does literally look better as the day goes on. And it lasts all day! (Or at least 12-14 hrs)&lt;br /&gt;My only issue is their shade selection, there just isn&#x27;t a lot of yellow under tone. However this one works quite nicely!</li>
