<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great oil. It has been useful for this summer sun and chlorine. It has made our hair silky and shiney.&lt;br /&gt;Small bottle but a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Bought this oil to go with my new curling wand. I wanted something that would protect my hair, especially my ends... Well, after a lot of research I decided on this HSI argon oil. It not only protects my hair but makes it shine, AND doesn&#x27;t leave it greasy or oily looking. A little goes a long way also!</li>
    <li> I received a sample of the oil with the flat iron I purchased.  I love the quality of this product.  It smells wonderful, not too strong, and it does not make my hair feel greasy.  It is definitely worth the price and a little goes a long way.  The combination of the Argan Oil with the HSI flat iron is perfect on my hair.  It has never been shinier and healthier looking.  For my fine, frizzy hair that&#x27;s an achievement!</li>
    <li> The HSI Professional Argan Oil makes my hair smooth and silky without feeling oily.  With other products I still had those little fuzzy ends (even after a new cut) when using a flat or curling iron.  With the Argan Oil, my hair style is flawless and has beautiful body.  Now that I&#x27;ve found this product I&#x27;ll never use anything else on my hair!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something to get rid of my frizzy and not so soft anymore hair and I finally found it. This stuff is great. It does not leave your hair oily and my hair is soft again! I used it on wet hair and then used a new wet/dry flat iron that I purchased from Amazon as well. So happy I didn&#x27;t have to result to expensive alternatives like a Brazilian blowout. My hair has slowly gotten more dry and frizzy the last yrs.</li>
    <li> The HSI Professional Argan Oil provides just what it promises; silky smooth hair. I purchased this product for my mom, who has dyed and styled her hair for over 30 years. Expectedly, her hair was showing permanent damage due to overheating. After she applied this product, her hair felt smooth from the first. She touches up every now and then if she feels like additional moisture is needed. The price of the product is fair for the quantity and quality. If you have oily hair, this product might not be for you. Otherwise, I think it is a great purchase, especially to control the frizz.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for SOMETHING to help with my frizzy hair. I&#x27;ve used sooo many different products to try to get the frizz to go away. When I purchased the HSI flat iron, there was a sample bottle of this in the package. I tried it and I fell in love right away. And a little bit goes a long way, so the bottle will last a while. THIS is the product I&#x27;ve been searching for. I&#x27;m so confident about it that I&#x27;m giving away all of my hair products I was using before. I will definitely be buying the biggest bottle they have of this for the rest of my life!!</li>
    <li> I was surprised at how little this bottle of oil is but then saw it was thick and 100% Aragan oil-no filler oils. It has made my hair smooth and no fly aways ir frizzies. I will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> I am glad to order this product for my hair.  A little goes a long way.  This was my first time trying this product.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I have dry hair and some frizz but this stuff puts it under control. Love it! Will buy more I am sure!</li>
    <li> Really love how soft and conditioned it makes my hair feel.  A pump for it would be a handy thing to have.</li>
    <li> I personally love this product. It leaves MY hair feeling great, weightless, and smelling amazing!&lt;br /&gt;IF YOU DON&#x27;T LIKE CONES, this product isn&#x27;t for you.&lt;br /&gt;MY hair seems to like this product and I will continue using it. Truly is an all around awesome product.</li>
    <li> Love it. : )  highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I like how the oil is not greasy and the scent is wonderful as well. I use it as directly, applied on towel dried hair and then my hair shines beautifully, again, no grease residue at all. I also sometimes add it to my conditioner and it works that way as well. Great product. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Great! Makes my hair really soft and manageable. Good buy!</li>
    <li> Made my hair soft,smooth,and very manageable.  I like your product .</li>
    <li> I have very dry hair and when it is humid out, it gets very frizzy.  And in Texas, it&#x27;s always humid.  This product makes my hair very soft, smooth, and helps prevent the frizzies.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 6 months now and I&#x27;m very happy with it.  It doesn&#x27;t take much and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> This leave in condition works wonders! It makes my hair soft and silky and protects it from the damage caused by blow drying, curling and straightening. I would recommend this product to anyone who styles their hair. It really does make a difference!</li>
    <li> I bought this product after reading the other reviews.  What else can I say?  It does the job.  The hair looks silky, shiny and smells good.  I use it with the HSI flat iron.</li>
    <li> I love it it makes my hair silky smooth and I&#x27;ve never had a product that my hair isn&#x27;t dry after flat ironing!!</li>
    <li> This oil helps smooth frizzy ends but does not add the shine I would like. I do like that it is not heavy and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This is by far the absolute best argan oil product I&#x27;ve used.  It leaves my hair silky and shiny and has allowed for less breakage and longer hair growth.  I love, love love it and will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, coarse and wavy hair. I have tried just about every product on the market. I fell in love with this HSI Argan Oil the first time I tried it. It makes my hair so shiny and silky! It works wonders with my flat iron to make my hair straighter than it has ever been!! I love it and will continue to order this! Very prompt delivery and packaged very carefully. Thanks again!!</li>
    <li> Great product! I have dry hair due to a lot of bleaching and this oil really helps to smooth and hydrate my brittle ends. I usually apply before heat styling and really notice a difference compared to when I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> The first few weeks i was a little disappointed as it did nothing to my hair but then after regular use my hair is so shiny, silky, soft and straight. People have been asking me what i have done to my hair as it looks so straight and soft. I really love this product and i think i will order more once i am done with this done. The other thing i liked most about it is I don&#x27;t even have to use more in my hair.. just a few drops and it will work wonders.. I would definitely recommend this product to my friends.</li>
    <li> At first I didn&#x27;t like the product and didn&#x27;t think it worked and left it sitting on the shelf. I tried it again and this product does everything it claims. It eliminated frizz from my hair and made my hair feel very soft. It didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and my did not feel oily. I also like the fact that you couldn&#x27;t smell it on my hair.</li>
    <li> I have dealt with frizzy hair all of my life.  The argan oil leaves my hair feeling soft and manageable without being weighted down.  I would definitely purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> This product is incredibly amazing! I have thick, \\&quot;black\\&quot; hair type that is always screaming for management. My hair is ALWAYS sucking up moisture which just seems to quickly evaporate from it, for some reason; therefore, it&#x27;s always SUPER DRY, BRITTLE, BREAKING OFF, CRUNCHY, you name it. I&#x27;m surprised I&#x27;m not bald, lol. I&#x27;ve been through chemical processing, and colouring on my own because I can&#x27;t afford the high hairdresser fees (besides I like my own styling, not theirs). Anywhoooo, I invested over $100 recently on equipment and 1 product; that is, a hairdryer kit, electric hot-comb (no more chemical processing for me), silk scarf (used to wrap my hair at night), and one 4-oz bottle of HSI Professional Argan Oil Leave In Conditioner. This was my hair&#x27;s dream-team, lead by the HSI product. Everything was as normal, using all the equipment BUT when my hair got a hold of the HSI product, it finally surrendered. I&#x27;m not kidding! No more crunchiness, no more breaking, no more splitting, no more brittle feel. Instead my hair is soft, and honestly silky (that&#x27;s where the shock came to me); so, it&#x27;s very manageable and happy. My plan is to keep my hair healthy, grow it out, do NOT process it chemically (instead I will use by hot-iron-comb to press out my roots), and continue using my (very old) tiny flat iron (for styling). Under that budget, that&#x27;s my solution. Use HSI Professional Argan Oil Leave In Conditioner, and your hair will behave!</li>
    <li> This leaves my hair soft and smelling great.  It does NOT leave the hair oily when used as directed.  It has a very soft but good smell (I have very bad allergies and it does not affect my allergies).  I use it before I blow dry and again after styling for smoothing.  I love the way it makes my hair feel.  I have thin baby fine hair that is shoulder length.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally write the review but I decided to write one here. When I opened the package the cap was not tighten enough so liquid was leaking and box was soaking wet. Other than that I love this product and this really does make my hair shine and keeps my hair straight all day long. It is too bad that it had a packaging issue....</li>
    <li> It has a pleasant smell and is not heavy on my hair. I  use it as a smoothing serum when flat ironing my  long mixed hair and it works wonders.  it&#x27;s cheaper than some of the smaller  (product heavy) chi  brand serums. I  also use right after washing my hair when I&#x27;m not going straight  as a leave in. a  little goes a long way.I believe this is what&#x27;s making my hair stronger.I waited too review because sometimes my hair loves a product for the first couple uses and then doesn&#x27;t. this in not the case with this product. I  would definitely recommend this  especially for mixed hair. it&#x27;s always hard for us to find a good product.</li>
    <li> This stuff works wonder on my chemically treated frizzy hair. With a very small amount of usage, Leaves my hair smooth and shiny!  I&#x27;ll be reordering this again . Thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not totally sold on this but so far I&#x27;m enjoying the benefits of the argan oil.  I&#x27;m just not sure about the long term effects of silicone based products hence my reservations and 4-star review.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have heavily highlighted blond hair , naturally dark brown and fine.  This stuff gives me more volume and shine plus protects it from heat products.  Great stuff.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice product if you are using a curling or straightening iron. Without I still get those little fly away but this leaves my hair super smooth and shiny.  People always compliment my hair when I use this. Be careful you don&#x27;t overdo it or it can make your hair a little greasy I also don&#x27;t put it near my roots just lightly from the middle to the ends.</li>
    <li> This product is lovely! My naturally wavy hair loves it. :)</li>
    <li> I received the item on time but the cap of the bottle was broken. Luckily, I didn&#x27;t lose any of the contents of the bottle but it&#x27;s annoying to own because I had to tape up the cap to keep it from splitting each time I use it. :( No Bueno.</li>
    <li> I bought this and was not impressed. I could think of several others that are better and for the same price. Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my wife, she is very happy with it. I will definitely be purchasing this product again in the future.</li>
    <li> This product makes my hair shiny everyday.  I have mid length hair and wash my hair almost everyday.  This stuff keeps my hair shiny and the ends healthy.  I usually only used the flat iron twice a week because of the dried ends.  But I have been using it everyday this past week because of this oil.  Good product.</li>
    <li> Do you ever have a day when everything goes wrong?  That was Monday for me...I died my hair what was supposed to be a darker blond, well it turned out a dark brown with red highlights.  I tried the natural way to remove the hair color baking soda, peroxide and shampoo, it only took out some of the darkness and I looked a hundred years older.  Then tried the chemical removal treatment which took out most of the color but destroyed the heck out of my hair! Ouch!  So after washing all the chemicals out of my hair I grabbed my Aragan Oil and placed that on the dry damaged hair...the oil revitalized my hair and it is starting to return to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the product, I have tired others and it did not compare to the HSI Professional Aragn Oil, thick, rich, and best of all it smells terrific.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sample has turned into me using on my face and hands the fine lines are disappearing and my hair is looking better than ever!</li>
    <li> This oil does as is promised but I would caution to use only a tiny drop, otherwise I think your hair would be greasy  This bottle should last a loooong time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other major brand products but this one beats them!  Price is right and the seller delivers the product promptly!  The scent is very pleasant, is not greasy on hands, and a little goes a long way.  I&#x27;ll come back to get some more for refill in the future!</li>
    <li> This is by far one of the BEST purchases I have made in terms of hair products. I have long naturally curly hair and use about a nickel size amount of this in my hair while damp and it keeps my hair nourished and frizz-free, whether I am blow drying and flat-ironing it, or letting it air dry. It doesn&#x27;t weigh down or make my hair feel oily at all! The smell is AMAZING! You really can&#x27;t go wrong here. The size of the bottle compared to how little is needed means this will last a very long time. Well worth it!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!!! Just a a few drops,  and my hair is as soft as silk. I even had a few friends commenting how soft and healthy my hair looks now.  (My hair was very frizzy and dry looking before)  For sure I will purchasing a lot more of this \\&quot;Miracle in a bottle\\&quot; like I call it.  It&#x27;s worth every penny!!! i highly recommend this product.  You will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and you can&#x27;t beat the fast shipping and great price! I use it with my HSI flat iron and my hair is silky smooth.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter absolutely loves this product.</li>
    <li> I have hair that is thinner, not fine and not thick.  I color my hair so when using styling tools, definitely need some protection.  I only use this on my ends though as I feel that throughout the day my hair goes a little flat and can get oily if I go overboard with this product.  I am still looking for the product that is the \\&quot;one\\&quot; for my hair type, unsure if I will purchase again, but worth a shot!</li>
    <li> I just LOVE this product so much it is AMAZING!! I have super thick frizzy (latina) hair and have tried sooo many different products in my quest for silky, smooth and shiny hair and finally I have found something that actually works! &#x3D;D  A little goes a long way, the oil is very thick and the scent is lovely! I use it after blow drying my hair, then straighten it with my flat iron-its not an HSI flat iron but it works great. It does not make my hair greasy. My hair stays so smooth and silky all day I love it! I have also received many compliments!&lt;br /&gt; I will most definitely be repurchasing and I highly recommend this to friends and family and you &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Consent battle with wave and uncontrollable hair that has a mind of it own with frizziness and flyaways; with this product I am able to control this problem. When my hair is wet, I will apply before blow-drying;then us a little bit after to give a little shine and helps keeping my hair hydrated. For the days I don&#x27;t feel like blow-drying, I still apply while wet and it will keep my curls uniform! This is such a great product and have already gone through one bottle, which lasts me a couple of months with almost on a daily basis. Great product at such a great value!</li>
    <li> The hsi professional argan oil works wonders. I ordered this with the flat iron and they work great i will deff be buying more stuff from this seller :)</li>
    <li> Love this.  Dry and Frizzy hair is much more manageable with HSI Professional Argan Oil.  A tiny bit and the directions followed made my hair smoother without that heavy feeling.  I plan to purchase in the future.</li>
    <li> I have aging (45), colored, and prone to frizzy hair and have been looking for an oil-based product that will protect my hair during the too-often flat-ironing.  I read the reviews of this product and decided to give it a try...it is awesome! Oh my gosh! I am not easily impressed with hair products but HSI Professional Argan Oil Leave In Conditioner is the best. I let my hair air dry and before using my flat iron I apply a small amount of the oil starting from the ends and working my way up staying at least an inch from the roots. I wait a minute to let it absorb and then iron my hair...the frizz is gone, my hair is straight, and what&#x27;s best is that it takes less time to straighten and it feels soft! I will definetly be ordering this product again.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product since there were so many amazing reviews of it. It is a very nice product and does make your hair silkier and protect it from heat damage.  I was expecting it to be a bit more amazing than it was, but it is still very good.  I&#x27;m not sure if I will order it again when I am done or go back to the Paul Mitchell oil drops I was using.  The seller was quick to send it to me and it is a nice product.</li>
    <li> It was almost like a sudden change in my hair condition. I have thick and coarse hair and I was struggling to find a product to make my hair soft. After applying this product, my hair felt really soft and nice. I love this product</li>
    <li> My hair is thick and usually deemed \\&quot;normal\\&quot; but with the meds I have been taking it&#x27;s like the tumbleweed connection. The back especially seeing as I am a back sleeper was soo bad I thought nothing would help. Then....... BAAZING! A tiny amount worked thru clean hair aand it&#x27;s now back to normal and then some. Do not hesitate purchasing this seller is really nice and the item shipped quickly. I will use this from now on.  :)</li>
    <li> I have very course and oft times out of control hair, especially in the summer. I almost always have to pull it back unless it is professionally done. This product actually works! I use it along with the tourmaline flat iron..just use the small amount recommended. That&#x27;s all you will need. I wore my hair down in the heat and humidity and it remained smooth and manageable. Great product.  Unbelieveable!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this product! My hair has always been thick and dry looking. After using this product before blow drying in the evening and using my NEW HSI Professional hair straightener in the morning of which I used the Argan Oil again, my hair is SALON perfect. My hair is so soft, moveable and I get SO many compliments. I will never go back to another product!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a excellent product to use during heat treatment and leaves hair soft and smooth. Originally I got sample with hair straightener and t was amazing.</li>
    <li> GREAT STUFF!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love HSI Argan Oil leaves my hair looking shinier and with less frizz.  I now have silky soft hair even with daily flat iron use. Would totally recommend it and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Truly leaves hair soft, smooth, and silky, with a light, clean scent. It helps me tame frizz, even without use of a flat-iron.</li>
    <li> HSI Professional Argan Oil is best helper I have. It saves me at least half the usual time as my hair is so easy to manage after I apply it. Use only a drop and it leaves shine without that oily look. I love it!!!!</li>
    <li> HSI professional Argan Oil really has effect on my hair. My hair becomes more nourished and smooth after applying this product. And I like the smell, which is not strong and very natural. It&#x27;s a good deal in terms of the price and effect.</li>
    <li> This oil is GREAT!!! I will most definitely re-order and tell friends about this product how great it feels on your hair</li>
    <li> First off I received this product early which was great! Secondly this leave in treatment made my hair very soft and silky without too much shine...I was very amazed how straight my hair turned out after flat ironing...I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> I really really like this product. Leaves my hair feeling silky and smooth!! The fragrance is just right too!! Love it!!</li>
    <li> This oil is the best I have ever put on my hair! It makes your hair so shiny and silky .  I purchased this with the Hsi flat iron.  Love, love these to products together!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing and a little goes a long way. My client has course hair, I applied a very small amount into my hand and rubbed it into her strands. I used the HSI flat iron and that hair just laid so beautifully. Made me want to press out my own hair.</li>
    <li> Works great makes my hair really smooth and shiny, a little bit is enought you dont need to put alot</li>
    <li> My wife got the sample with the hair strainer, she like it, she said its amazing and it smooths my hair</li>
    <li> A good conditioner without being oily</li>
    <li> This product is so amazing. My hair has been thru so much. I have bought many things and nothing worked until I bought hsi. I am so happy I will continue using for ever.</li>
    <li> leaves my hair smooth and manageable and also i have reduced split ends</li>
    <li> I have long, wavy/curly, frizzy hair.  Of course, most days I just put it up with a clip or put it in a bun.  It&#x27;s just too much trouble to blow dry and straighten for someone lazy like me.  When I do blow dry though, the ends feel dry.  This argan oil conditioner comes in the brown glass bottle shown in the picture.  The cap is easy to twist.  There is no dropper or anything.  I just pour a small amount onto my hands and rub it through my wet or dry hair.  The product feels viscous out of the bottle, but distributes well with a rub between the hands.  It leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice product.  I apply only a little bit to my wet hair and when I dry it it looks so nice and feels very good, very smooth and shinny.  And it smells very nice, too.  I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> My hair tends to be coarse and dry, this conditioner makes all the difference especially when using my flat iron.  This stuff is great!</li>
    <li> My hair is naturally curly (which I hate), so I flat iron my hair almost every day. It only takes a couple of drops and this oil makes my hair sleek and silky, it looks and feels absolutely great. I&#x27;m in love with it!</li>
    <li> I believe HSI PROFESSIONAL ARGAN OIL LEAVE IN CONDITIONER is the best product of it&#x27;s type on the market. It works well on my longer curley-type hair. I have a frizz issue and HSI keeps my hair staying smooth and silky longer, without it making it greasy; the smell it leaves in your hair is also a plus. I do and will continue to buy this product and pass this information along to anybody who wants their hair to be great looking, manageable and smelling wonderful.</li>
    <li> I definitely like this product.  It makes my hair nice and shiny using only a little bit (too much can make hair kind of thick and dull).  It makes all the difference in the world with a flat iron.  It smells really nice too; much better than some of the other shining products.</li>
    <li> This oil is very good for african american hair type , was  able to add moisture, luster and sftness to my hair and my daughter who has a natural unrelaxed hair , it always allows for easy strengthening of hair , good smell too , not so strong. will surely by from this seller agin</li>
    <li> All these oils are the same! It smells nice but doesn&#x27;t work any better then any of my other oils. So tired of listening to the &amp;#34;wonderful things&amp;#34; their oil can do and then finding out it is just like the other ones I have.</li>
    <li> I put the tiniest bit of this oil in the palm of my hand, put it in my hair as directed in the instructions, and my hair untangled easily after washing and most importantly, it corrected the dry feeling of my hair immediately. It feels so moist and hydrated now even after 1 use. I don&#x27;t use it every day, 2-3 times a week.  i don&#x27;t have to, it&#x27;s that good! The bottle will last forever. My hair is fine and straight as a pin.</li>
    <li> I used to use Agadir Argan oil for a few years and loved it at first but it seems to not work as effectively to tame the frizz of my curly hair recently.  Browsing through Amazon, I came across HSI and after the good reviews, figured I&#x27;d try it. I am very happy that I did!!!  It&#x27;s an absolutely great product...it does an extremely great job of keeping the frizz down and what I love most is that it is not at all greasy which boggles my mind but I love it. I know it works on my curly hair and can&#x27;t wait to see how it makes my hair look when I straighten it. I highly recommend this product to anyone who has hard to manage curly frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> This product is really great. I have platinum blonde hair that I dye myself regularly. This product is one of my favorites now for keeping my hair healthy, soft and shiny. Also it really does seem to work well with heat styling tools. I use a flat iron I&#x27;ve had for years and it works great with this product.&lt;br /&gt;I previously bought another brand of pure Moroccan Argan Oil and I loved it but I decided to try the HSI brand as it was much more affordable and had good reviews. I will buy this one again! I have barely put a dent in it and have used it at least 4-5 days a week for probably a month now. I&#x27;ve noticed a significant improvement in the softness of my hair. I use it between blow-drying and heat styling. It only takes a small amount, rub between palms and distribute through hair. Avoid the roots if your hair tends to look greasy from products like this. Thanks!</li>
    <li> HSI Professional argan oil is a must have for use with your flat iron.  Protects hair from heat damage and leaves it silky soft.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.. I would highly recommend this! Perfect for healthy, beautiful, shiny, straight hair! A must have product, to complete your hair styling needs!</li>
    <li> Leaves hair silky.  Difficult to get just a few drops out with the bottle.  Maybe consider adding a tip to allow easier dispensing.</li>
    <li> I use this after the shower.  It makes my hair manageable and soft.  I&#x27;ve have bad hair in general. It tangles and becomes a knot filled mess. Even after one use, I was able to comb my hair without pain.  Awesome stuff!</li>
    <li> It is way better than silicone. It doesn&#x27;t leave the hair oily, instead it gives shine. Excellent value for the size.</li>
    <li> The conditioner was everything it said it was. My wife&#x27;s hair is very manageable and very soft-she keeps wanting me to &#x27;feel my hair&#x27;. Started using the Aragon oil myself.</li>
    <li> When my stylist told me I needed moisture, moisture, moisture, and ALWAYS a thermal conditioner, I ordered this one. I didn&#x27;t expect it to be actual oil, but it is. Unlike other oils I tried, this one does not weight down the hair or make it greasy or gummy. My only suggestion would be a spray bottle to make it easier to apply.</li>
    <li> Came with a pump top that doesn&#x27;t fit 😒</li>
    <li> I got this product when I purchased my staightener. I thought it was going to be a cheap add on item and to my surprise, it works so well! I love it and I will be purchasing more.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love the argon oil! My daughter&#x27;s hair is all the way down her back &amp; we have to either brad it for curl, or flat iron it every day. With the argon oil, I apply to damp hair and blow dry. With the argon oil, I don&#x27;t have to flat iron at all and she can even go a second day without extra styling. Added bonus: she is 8yrs old &amp; has had a terrible problem with her hair becoming tangled throughout the day. With the argon oil, it is soooo much easier to brush through! No more tears! (She is tender headed) Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> The seller was great, shipped on time, no qualms there. The oil itself is what gets a 4/5. I like it but don&#x27;t love it. It&#x27;s really oily, hard to spread through hair because it&#x27;s very thick. But does a good job if you can get it spread out.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair shiny and soft. I use it right before my flat iron on damp hair then a tiny bit after on my dry hair. Great results. Smells good too.</li>
    <li> I used many products before &amp; I love this one. My sister used it at my house and purchesesd one for herself. Of makes your hair shinny and silky. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Makes hair shiny and soft and does not leave greasy feeling. Helps with my thick frizzy hair. I love it.</li>
    <li> I used Biotin Silk Oil for years and have been wanting to try other products. This brand argon oil came with a straightener I had bought in a trial size packet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I AM IN LOVE AND MUST HAVE MORE!!!! I have fine, thin, silky hair that gets easily greasing with to many products or too much of one product. I use a few drops on this throughout my hair (especially middle and ends) and I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied!! It leaves my hair silky smooth, healthy looking, lightweight, and it protects from heat and color damage?!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait for my big bottle and definetley recommend this product to those with frizzy, unhealthy ends!!!</li>
    <li> This conditioner is terrific for my thick, course, naturally curly hair.  It is great for making my hair soft and manageable, especially when I&#x27;m straightening it with a straight iron.</li>
    <li> This HSI Argan Oil Leave In Conditioner is fantastic! It leaves my hair so soft, shiny, healthy-looking and manageable, but it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down or make it look oily at all, I love it! Also, I have pretty thick hair and I only need to use a couple of drops. It smells really nice, too. It&#x27;s well worth the money and I would absolutely recommend it!</li>
    <li> My hair in the summer time gets super frizzy. It&#x27;s difficult to find something to help since I have fine hair, but argan oil seems to work really well. I really love it!</li>
    <li> This oil is the best oil out there! It really seeks your hair and makes it shiny and soft. It works really well with the HSI flat iron. You can&#x27;t get any better than this!</li>
    <li> I love this leave-in treatment. I think I discovered it by doing a search under Hair Treatments and sorting by &amp;#34;Highest Avg. Review&amp;#34; - and now I understand why HSI was at the top of the list. This leave-in makes my hair soft, smooth, shiny, and manageable. Other leave-ins made my hair too greasy and stringy-looking at the ends, but this one never does. You still have to make sure you don&#x27;t use too much, though - I use about a dime-sized drop and I make sure to only smooth it over the ends of my hair one time as opposed to multiple times. I like that it&#x27;s pleasantly scented but the scent also fades almost completely once your hair is dry. It also cuts down on drying time and helps calm static-y strands during the winter months. I tried this product on a whim, but now I never want to be without it!</li>
    <li> My hair is very, very dry. After I try so many different products including conditioner to treatment, so far this is the only one make my hair moist and soft. I only have to use very little of it.  Only thing I don&#x27;t like about is the container.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I will keep buying this product. I really like the smell.</li>
    <li> I really love this oil treatment smells really good and live the hair super soft and shine and most important is organic.</li>
    <li> I adore this oil.  The very first hair oil of any type (including other argan oils) that actually made a difference in my hair. A difference not only noted by myself, but also by my friends.  The real test was on a humid day and my hair remained frizz-free!  I am amazed! T</li>
    <li> This did not work for me.  I have rosacea and should have known better.  The smell was a bit much for me too.</li>
    <li> Wonderful.  Made my limp hair so much softer and less prone to splitting.  My hair actually looks fuller now, but it&#x27;s just because its healthier.  I really don&#x27;t know why you wouldn&#x27;t love this product.  This makes my hair is soft and never greasy (apply just to the ends of hair).</li>
    <li> I received a sample bottle of the HSI Argan Oil when I purchased the HSI Flat Iron.  The Argan Oil is fantastic.  My hair is very thick, wavy, and dry.  In addition, I color it about every six to eight weeks.  The argan oil makes my hair feel very smooth and it looks and feels healthy.  The price is very reasonable and you should try it and see for yourself.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of different argan oils and this one is, by far, the best! It gets my very curly hair so much silkier than the other argan oils I&#x27;ve used. This is professional oil and is worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard of the smoothing power of argan oil and I never would have thought of trying it if it wasn&#x27;t included as a free sample in my [[ASIN:B001MA0QY2 HSI The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener, 1 inch]] purchase. I&#x27;m glad that HSI Professional is the kind of seller that&#x27;s willing to let customers like me try something new and benefiting for them--I think that level of aiming to please is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a newbie to hair care as I&#x27;ve only started consciously playing around with it a month ago. When I apply the argan oil to my damp hair, it doesn&#x27;t give me an oily residue and heavy feeling on my strands once it dries, but then again I don&#x27;t use a lot (I believe less is more).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it smells wonderful by the way; not oily/greasy-smelling but a light perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mostly use it before I blow dry my hair (which I found leaves it less frizzy and more smoother-looking than without the oil) and after I flat iron it to re-moisturize and nourish my hair. Like I said, it&#x27;s my first time so I&#x27;m not sure what the exact hows and ways of application, but one thing for sure is that this product leaves my hair looking healthier and shinier than it has ever looked. I work in a bakery, and I live in the south, so it gets hot and humid and my hair still stays wonderfully smooth, well-behaved, and not dry at the end of the day and lasts that way for up to two days.</li>
    <li> One of my friends recommended me this product and I was hesitating getting it because I think it was out of my budget. However, I got this product yesterday and I love it. It leaves my hair very shiny and it looks very healthy. The product is not greasy or thick as other hair oils. I love it and I will continue buying it in the future.</li>
    <li> My wife has very curly hair and want straight hair. So a lot of ironing which make the hair brittle.  This oil has nearly stopped the breakage.  She uses it every day. Very good product. Great seller.</li>
    <li> It is a very good product.  It did what it stated it would do.  I will definitely purchase it again.  It was delivered within the specified time..</li>
    <li> Little goes a long way for my long hair. It helps with frizzy hair and conditioning.</li>
    <li> Loved the product!!!&lt;br /&gt;It made my hair so soft that I can easily comb it after the shower and I even straighten my hair once(not daily as before).&lt;br /&gt;My hair stays soft and no more frizz.</li>
    <li> I love that this product protects my hair from the heat of my flat iron, AND it leaves my hair soft and shiny. Very happy customer!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product.  By far the best that I have ever used after trying about 15 other products. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> It was great while it lasted. Just died after 18months. It gets really hot. Gloves it came with were useless.</li>
    <li> Great oil! I use it everyday.</li>
    <li> UGGGH, this is not pure oil. I&#x27;ve been using the trial size recently, and I was coming here to buy more until I found out there was SILICONE in it as one of the main ingredients. Unbelievable! Do you have any idea how horrible that silicones are for your hair? They coat your hair with basically plastic, which makes your hair shiny at first. Then your hair is unable to properly be hydrated, until you do a special scrub that can scrape the silicone out. The result of silicone is straw-like, dry hair. Google this if you&#x27;re interested in learning more or, if you think I&#x27;m full of it, but this is exactly why there are more and more silicone-free hair care products popping up now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those of you who are trying to repair their hair for the long term need to be wary of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dammit. I hate these lazy companies who take this cheap route. I feel like I&#x27;ve been tricked, and it&#x27;s not a good feeling.</li>
    <li> It smells great and makes my hair soft and shiny without making it look greasy. Pricey but lasts a while.</li>
    <li> Makes hair very soft and silky but isn&#x27;t greasy at all.  Just like salon treatment at fraction of price.  Can use on wet or dry hair.</li>
    <li> Made my frizzy hair soft, but does not work on a rainy day. Overall good product to control the tight curls and frizz. I am using this product for past  4 weeks I can clearly see that it does not make the hair oily or heavy.</li>
    <li> A sample of this product was included with a curling iron I purchased.  It was a few months before I used the sample because I thought it would leave my hair feeling oily.  I have wavy hair and spend a great deal of time trying to straighten it.  My hair had become dry so I decided to give the sample a try.  I was very pleased with the results.  It leaves my hair feeling soft and shiny, easier to manage, with absolutely no oily feel on my hair or my hands.  It makes straightening my hair easier, but also makes it easier to manage if I simply dry it and leave it natural, which is something I don&#x27;t typically care to do.  I am very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Update 4/7/2017:  reduced to 4 stars because of packaging (see below).&lt;br /&gt;It used to come in a dark brown bottle through which you could see how much was still in it. This new, plastic bottle obviously does not have that advantage.  Furthermore, the pump is messy. Oil dribbles out. I ended up transferring a small amount into a different dispenser (see below).  That was messy, too, but one medium mess is better than an everyday mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review from 2013 (?)&lt;br /&gt;I have wavy, not-thick, unremarkable Northern European hair.  This product makes it feel silky and healthy even though I wash it and use a straightener on it every day.&lt;br /&gt;Buy with confidence.&lt;br /&gt;Because the oil comes in a glass bottle with a screw-top lid, I purchased the following plastic bottle with pump dispenser:  [[ASIN:B003IQRKDI Kingsley Travel Bottles 1 69 Pump]]&lt;br /&gt;The dispenser pumps out exactly the right amount of oil for my purposes.  I&#x27;d recommend looking at it, too.</li>
    <li> Terrific product that really works.  My daughter has long, coarse, naturally curly hair that is next to impossible to straighten.  This oil along with the flat iron made her hair so shiny and smooth...She actually asked me to run my fingers through her hair after straightening for the first time.  I was amazed!  She says the oil allowed her to be able to straighten and maintain that style.  Love the product and highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This product had excellent reviews which led me to my purchase. I must say, it does not dissapoint. I apply a dime size amount onto my damp hair and then blow dry. It seems to help with smoothing, softness, and conditioning without leaving a heavy residue.  I&#x27;ve been using it over a month and I was looking for it to restore my hair to help with growth. Although I&#x27;ve noticed no faster benefit with hair growth, my hair does seem a bit stronger, healthier, and easier to manage.</li>
    <li> Bought this after using a friend&#x27;s Argan oil. At first I thought it would be 100% oil, but it is not. However, it works beautifully on my fine, long blond hair to sleek it down but not weigh it too much. The bottle lid screws tightly so you can travel with it and no spills. I wish it came with additional lid with pump though. Otherwise, I&#x27;m satisfied!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t see a difference in my hair since I started using it. And heat damage is still there. Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Compare with the other band of hair care oil, this is much better because they are not oily and absorb immediately to my hair. Its good to use it before styling. And also the smell nice, refreshing! However, it is better to have a pump included, as it is inconvenience to open the lid every time. All of all is worth to try and definitely I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I use this product on my hair ends after I blow dry and before I straight iron. The aroma is fantastic! I haven&#x27;t been able to tell a difference on my hair health or my split ends. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 8 months. I can really tell a difference in the summer time when the &#x27;frizz&#x27; starts to invade. Be careful, using too much and too close to the scalp will leave you with oily, flat hair and you will be rewashing it. Also, after about 3 weeks, I have to wipe down my straightening iron and remove the caked on oil as to not be redistributed through my hair, making is greasy.</li>
    <li> I originally received a sample of this product with my HSI flat iron.  I was concerned that it would leave my hair greasy, especially since I prefer to only wash my hair every 2-3 days.  Instead, this product keeps my hair soft and manageable for days!  I loved the sample so much that I bought the full size.  Just be sure to only use a small amount as the directions state!</li>
    <li> [...]&lt;br /&gt;I USE TO USE PAUL MITCHELLS PRODUCTS SKINNY SERUM, HOWEVER THIS I BY FAR 100%&lt;br /&gt;BETTER AND LEAVES YOUR HAIR VERY MOISTURIZED.</li>
    <li> Bought for daughter- she liked the way it conditioned her hair when straightening. Would purchase again and recommend to others.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Have purchased for family and friends as well.  Leaves hair silky and smooth and reduces the damage from heat styling.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner! I have very thick, curly and frizzy hair. The Argan Oil makes my hair feel silky and smooth and doesn&#x27;t feel oily at all. Wish I knew about it years ago! :)</li>
    <li> It leaves my hair soft, no frizz, shiny and it makes so much easier to iron it and very important it doesnt leave my hair oily.</li>
    <li> I use the HSI Argan oil in my hair before I blow dry then again before I flat iron. Leaves my hair smooth and gives a nice sheen.</li>
    <li> I decided to try after reading the other reviews.  I love the smell and it makes my hair soft &amp; shiny. Great product! So glad I tried it.</li>
    <li> Great product! My hair is thin and I used my iron every day so I need a good product. It leaves my hair smooth and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;Also it seems to keep my hair protected so I really liked!</li>
    <li> I have very thick, dry curly hair and I&#x27;m always looking for a good serum to calm down the frizz. I tried this product and liked it, I even purchased the ceramic flat iron...I am very satisfied with both products!!!</li>
    <li> This oil really makes your hair smooth as silk.  It keeps it healthy looking, smells great and on Amazon, a really good price.  I will buy again and recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> I have used argan oil before but the reason I like this product is that it works and the price was great for the amount you get.</li>
    <li> Smells great.  Works fairly well to bring down my red, Irish frizz, but my hair won&#x27;t hold curl beyond an hour if I use this.  However, it works amazingly well when I blow dry: silky.  But don&#x27;t over use it or you get that heavy, dirty scalp feeling.  Despite this, I like the product above all anti-frizz products so far.  Like I said, I just have to avoid the curling iron.</li>
    <li> So far the best hair treatment oil I&#x27;ve tried in years, even better than the expensive Salon brands. I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I have permed hair, and wanted something that would leave it totally smooth sleek and not dry, not totally happy with it but I&#x27;ve already used some so...</li>
    <li> Best hair treatment oil I have ever used, it&#x27;s works like miracle for my dry hair, very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> I’ve pretty much gotten rid of every other hair product (other than my Living Proof Shampoo and Conditioner) since purchasing HSI. This miracle in a bottle delivers on its marketing promise. My long hair had gotten really dry and brittle from years of coloring and heat styling tools. Since using HSI for about a month now – my hair has reverted to its original state – healthy, strong, sleek and shiny. I have continued to color and use my styling tools – with no sign of “wear and tear&amp;#34;. Besides nourishing my hair, it serves as a heat protectant and also helps stave off environmental conditions like humidity. And the other reviewers are right – a tiny amount goes a long way. My only regret is that I had not discovered this product earlier in life. Also – I can’t find a single store in the Bay Area that sells this product. Thank God for Amazon. If not for Amazon’s “search” function – I would never have known of it. I searched for &amp;#34;best heat protection for hair” and HSI was the first product to show up. Oh, and one last thing - HSI if you are reading this, improve the delivery of this product please. A plastic bottle with a &amp;#34;squirt&amp;#34; feature would cause me so much less anxiety than a &amp;#34;pour out&amp;#34; glass bottle.</li>
    <li> I bought this to try over the argan oil product I bought at Sally&#x27;s Beauty.  I like this one much better as it lasts longer and my hair really responds to the product longer.  I get an extra day of \\&quot;good hair\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love this product! It is the best leave in treatment I have ever used, and I have tried many! Leaves my hair feeling soft and shiny and in this Texas humidity, that&#x27;s huge! Highly recommended...</li>
    <li> I have hair that can get very frizzy and hard to control.  I use my HSI flat iron every day which can damage hair.  I use just a little of this oil and my hair looks fantastic.  I have tried a lot of oils and this is definetely my favorite.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of the argan oil with an HSI flat iron that I purchased. I decided to give it a try and was blown away by the results. I have tried other products both from the drugstore and higher end products from beauty supply stores and they do not compare to this product. It does not leave your hair feeling greasy, rather it leaves hair feeling smooth and silky, and it looks shiny.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product when just blow drying alone or after blow drying and prior to using a flat iron. It leaves my hair super silky and shiny. It seems to also help straighten my hair faster and easier and my hair does not end up frizzy after straightening.</li>
    <li> I received a packet of Argan oil with a the purchase of a new hair dryer but pitched it figuring that nothing would help by coarse frizzy hair.  That was a big mistake.  I went to my hairdresser to have my hair trimmed and she applied stuff on her hands and starting rubbing it into my hair (which I wasn&#x27;t all that happy about because she knows I don&#x27;t like leave-in products).  She said it was the best thing ever to tame hair.  Asked her what it was and she said Argan oil.  I told her I had to research it before I bought a bottle.  After reading the great reviews, I purchased a bottle.  Wow! It really does make my hair softer and tames the frizz.  I also noticed that it takes a shorter amount of time to dry and flat iron.  The price and delivery time was awesome.  Great product.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner.  I put it on my hair after washing and before I use my flat iron (which I also bought at the same time) Make my hair feel so good and smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and decided to try this. I had all but despaired of having my normal, shiny and smooth hair as it had been in years past. My hair had become damaged after chemotherapy treatments, not to mention age, coloring and a lot of other medications. This product actually made my hair shiny as promised. It is smooth and feels much more healthy. I was pleasantly surprised. I have used many other products  and use salon shampoos, conditioners, etc. this is the most dramatic result I have experienced.  It also seems to improve my hair over time. It is not drying, nor does it cause my hair to feel limp. There is no trace of a greasy or heavy feel. I am thrilled!</li>
    <li> I received a sample with my hsi flat iron and had to have a full bottle right away. I love how this oil makes my hair feel. Most oils just sit on my hair and make it look dirty. This stuff soaks right in. Use it sparingly because a little goes a long way. I&#x27;ve really noticed a difference in the health of my hair as well. Love it.</li>
    <li> great stuff, it smells amazing and it makes my hair so soft</li>
    <li> As someone who blow dries and/or straightens her hair almost every day, I have tried almost every heat protectant/argan oil/hair goo out there. Kerastase, MoroccanOil, It&#x27;s a 10, Bed Head, Paul Mitchell, Redken, Giovanni, Chi, pretty much everything. (For background, I have a lot of hair but it is very thin and fine, so this review probably won&#x27;t help the thick and/or curly girls.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I can safely say this is among the best products I&#x27;ve tried, if not THE best. I&#x27;ve only had it for a week or so, so I can&#x27;t talk about the long term effects, but  it immediately worked better on frizz and flyaways than any product I&#x27;ve ever tried, even those stubborn broken-off hairs that seem to always stick straight up from the top of my head. It also works really well as an overnight leave-in if I rub a lot of it into the roots and ends of my hair and go to bed. I shower it out in the morning (but of course add back a little bit before blow drying) and it leaves my unbelievably shiny and soft.</li>
    <li> Great prouct! It works wonders for my hair. It smells good and keep my hair very healthy. I like to use it when I blow dry my hair. I wish it was a bigger bottle so it can last long.</li>
    <li> Thanks to Blue Novelties, I have received the HSI professional Argan oil. (Thanks!) This oil is amazing. You need about 4-5 drops, rub through hands, and evenly distributed. It absorbs easily and adds a wonderful shine and health to your hair</li>
    <li> The Argan Oil works perfect with the HSI Professional flat iron. The Wife tried it when she got it and it worked perfectly with no hassle or hang-ups. No mess, no fuss, and her hair was beautiful! If you get the flat iron then you MUST get the Argan Oil as well! And the turn around time, from ordering to delivering, was top notch! I recommend this product to everyone looking for it!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used the big bottle yet but the small bottle that came with the straightener works great</li>
    <li> My hair loves this stuff. If you have not tried this, you should. If you have dry dull hair, this Argan oil provides moisture, shine and bounce to lifeless hair. I am a black woman transitioning to natural so I add weave to my hair. This Argan oil makes it easy to blend your hair without gaps. There is no oily build up just beauty. I add a tiny bit to my leave out before heating it or blow drying. This protects my hair and it is worth it. No breakage or splits. My hair (natural) is bouncy and flows free and blends well after applying this product. glad I found it here Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> This Product is amazing it went above and beyond what I expect of it to do to my hair. it made it soft and shinny without it being to greasy. I defiantly will be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> Extremely satisfied with HSI Professional Argan Oil. Leaves my hair silky and shiny, just as it claims. Have already purchased a second 2oz bottle after trying the sample. Works wonders with HSI Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron!</li>
    <li> I love this oil, the last couple of years my hair has been freeze and this solves the problem. I have tried different oils before but nothing leaves my hair as silky as this, without that oily look.</li>
    <li> I love the way this oil smells- I have super fine, and damaged blonde hair, and it does leave it smooth and shiny without weighing it down too much. Occasionally it does tend to weight the top of my hair/roots down a bit, but never looks oily. I find the best way to use this is trying to avoid my roots and just concentrating on the ends of my hair.  Is great when you want to avoid tangles during the brush-out. I also think it has made my hair healthier, even when I skip a usage, the split ends aren&#x27;t as bad as before I was using it.</li>
    <li> The HSI Professional Argan Oil does not leave hair \\&quot;oily,\\&quot; but smooth and silky in looks and touch.  It conditions in a way that helps it to hold a wave from a curling iron or to flatten sleekly.</li>
    <li> I have long, thick, coarse hair that I have to tame with a lot of heat.  Over the years, my hair has dried out and breaks easily, so I&#x27;ve been looking for something to condition my hair and make it stronger.  I bought the HSI Argan Oil after reading the good reviews, and am very pleased!  I put a little bit of this stuff in my hair while it&#x27;s still damp (not soaking wet), and then blowdry and flat iron to make it nice and straight!  It makes my hair very shiny and it even seems to not be prone to kinks (from putting my hair in a pony tail) as much as normal. Great product, and you only need to use a little bit at a time, so this bottle will last a long time!</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous product and leaves my hair shiny and easy to manage. Not greasy at all which is what I was worried about as my hair is very fine.  I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I received a small sample bottle of this product with an HSI flat iron I purchased some time ago.  I used it anytime I straightened my hair and was quite impressed.  Previously my hair would look sort of dried out and fried after several days of straightening but with the use of this oil my hair looks great.  My current hairstyle calls for use of the flat iron daily and I&#x27;ve been wearing this style and using this oil for over six weeks.  My hair looks amazingly healthy and shiny.  I am in my early 50s and it is necessary to treat my locks with TLC.  This formula provides protection and moisture without weighing hair down.  It smells wonderful!  A few drops rubbed between my palms and applied to my wet hair before styling leaves me with soft, shiny, manageable hair.  A little goes a long way and my hair has never looked better.  You cannot go wrong with this product.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This ARGAN OIL LEAVE IN CONDITIONER is amazing!  I have very dry and frizzy hair, I have tried other argan oils and never got the results I was hoping for.  After washing my hair, I used a small amount of HSI Professional Argan oil through out my hair, and then dried my hair with the blow dryer.  After my hair was dry I used a small amount focusing on my ends and used the flat iron to straighten my hair. (just order the HSI Flat iron yesterday) I had AMAZING results! My hair is straight and very smooth.  It really took less time to do my hair. I love this stuff!  I would definitely recommend it to a friend!</li>
    <li> This reminds me of those old school Diamond Drops by African Pride that you find in the black hair ghetto section of the supermarket.  You put it on and it gives a shine without much added moisture or hydration.  It is also very much like Chi&#x27;s hair protection serum.  For an oil, I noticed that it left no oily residue on my hands and I applied it to my hair, so I looked up the ingredients to see why this was.  It has some other chemicals in it like silicone, it is not pure oil.  The way it feels on your hands, I would suspect this stuff is 90% silicone and 10% oil.  I am disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;My hair was still dry to the point where I had to get out my jojoba oil and put in.</li>
    <li> I purchased a new flat iron for my son&#x27;s wedding and a sample of this product came with it.  I LOVED it! Both the flat iron and the oil.  I only use the flat iron when I&#x27;m going out and getting dressed up! but I use the oil most days.  It makes my just past shoulder length hair so soft and swingy!  I purchased a full size and expect to continue to use it regularly.</li>
    <li> Great product! I use it when I flat iron my hair. Going to be ordering more soon! very reasonably priced!</li>
    <li> I love this product so much that I have recommended to my family and friends. I like to wear&lt;br /&gt;braids in my hair. As a result the synthetic hair has damaged my real human hair.&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for a hair product that would restore my hair and leave it soft and strong at the&lt;br /&gt;same time. I found this online and have been very pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> I love love this Argan oil, my hair looks healthy and shiny. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased several leave in conditioners and this product is by far my favorite. A little goes a long way so the bottle will last you a LONG time, and it leaves my hair feeling unbelievably soft, smooth and smelling good. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a smoothing leave in product.</li>
    <li> I am a black woman with natural (relaxer-free) hair. I like the versatility this offers, but when I choose to wear it straight I want it done with ease and efficiency; and I want it to last. The HSI Pro Ceramic Ionic Flat iron does that. The unit used with the HSI argan oil Leave in Conditioner made my hair straighter and silkier than it&#x27;s ever been with any flat iron, including the CHI! The effect lasted for over a week, even on some rainy days in Georgia. I am completely satisfied!</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed the product. Only reason I gave it 4 starts is because it should have a pump to make it easier to use</li>
    <li> Received in a timely manner and undamaged from company. Love the way my hair feels after using the Argan oil leave in conditioner and styling. Makes my hair look smooth and shiney!</li>
    <li> The Argan Oil Leave in Conditioner is great and leaves your hair soft and silky.  I was afraid to buy it because people were saying it left their hair oily.  I used it several times and it did not leave my hair oily.  It left my hair silky and straight.  This is a product I recommend to anyone who wants straight hair and if you are natural.  I have natural hair and after using this Argan Oil Leave in Conditioner, my hair looked like I had a perm. WOW!!!  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Wonderful oil for my naturally curly hair. This oil transforms my hair and isnt just a product on my hair. It quenches the thirst my hair needs from the heat of the iron.</li>
    <li> I love how this leave-in conditioner protects my hair and leaves it feeling soft. It also really makes it easier to brush through my hair when wet. Love it!</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this MIRACLE with my HSI Flat Iron....  I&#x27;ll start off by saying I&#x27;ve spent YEARS spending lots of money on trying to find products to smooth my hair and give the illusion of sealing the cuticle but the truth is almost all products OTC and Profession are silicone based.. they work in the temporary but actually leave my hair dry and unrully in not but a few hours after Styling my hair...  I started with matrix smoothing system.. the ENTIRE line...  it was much better than store brands but then I switched over to Paul Mitchel system and began using the super skinny serum and got onto the serum band wagon... again immediate result but silicone based and despite claims do NOT survive humidity or moisture.. AND you have to coat your hair in something to hold it in place.... there was no such thing as having one product to be my savior....  instead i ended up buying WHOLE lines..  And then more recently I went to ALL CHI products and was relatively satisfied. big fan of the Silk infusion serum.. the flat irons and their RX therapy moisture lock Hairspray *Note,  the serum is also Silicone though albeit better than the matrix or paul mitchell ...  I had to \\&quot;seal\\&quot; it in with the hair spray.. and it claims to allow movement and soft to the touch...  It DOES at shine and \\&quot;look\\&quot; soft but i hate to say it still felt like Aquanet if you touched it....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had developed a very involved weekly intensive hair ritual....  Once a week I used a 20-30 min session with hot coconut oil... then id wash it with keratin shampoo and condition... then wash it.. DRY it... then Apply a Prof Clear glazing system and do another 20 min session...  then wash it with brunette shine shampooo and conditioners... and THEN use another Glaze to intensify my brunette dye.... and THEN use color l color and humidity lock conditioner. leave in.. and then rinse.. and THEN add the CHI serum.. THEN blow dry my hair and it turned into a dry coarse bush of a tumble weed... then I&#x27;d use more serum... comb it in with a fine toothed comb... and a 3 day straight semi permanent straightener...  blow it out til hair is almost dry and somewhat straight and THEN use my chi flat iron... would look nice and THEN use the RX hairspray...  it gave the illusion of silky texture and shiny and straight ... but it WASNT..  i still had wave and as they day went on it returned to its original state .. it seemed the serum actually was drying my hair... and the constant ritual of hair care was exhaustive..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when i got my HSI flat iron.. it was the best choice in the lifetime of my hair!!!!  I wont go into the iron.. other than that it is my fave iron i ever had and works very quickly and does the job...  but this little bottle of argan oil that curiously came with it turned out to be the ultimate catalyst and a real life magical potion..  I made sure NOT to do my intensive ritual to test the quality of my product...  I put the oil in.. my hair absorbed it and immediately shined and began to straighten already.. beautiful sheen. lovely smell.. hair was supple...  and a mirror sheen. and THEN i used the flat iron .. I noticed steam coming off my hair .. but it was not at ALL damaging...  i was AMAZED at how with a single run through each section would come out flat and DEFINE. i never had definition before in my hair... and the MIRROR sheen... I have never seen such beautiful results in anyone outside the orient or middle east... ive always envied naturally straight and mirror sheen straight hair... its so elegant and refined and It MOVES.. naturally...  I ONLY used this oil and i got ALL the definition.. shine.. CONTROL.... and my hair MOVED and i could toss it and it would go back in place... i only used a SMALL amount of an ultra sheer hairspray to set my hair and it was ALL i needed...  I couldnt believe it.. this little oil...  how many 100&#x27;s of dollars have i wasted over the year desperate for straight silky hair and then all of a sudden i have it....  the best part of the oil too is it protects from heat. it also SEALS the cuticle.. silicons DO NOT.. they just weigh the hair down and build up...  the Oil is so light.. it SEEMS expensive for the amount you get.. but remember its totally natural and pure...  and iVE never come across anything like it.. also each time you use it the texture and condition of your hair gets BETTER.  I have much more FREEDOM now and no more helmet head or a battle... i have battle my curls and waves my whole life desperately wanting straight shiny hair.... I FINALLY have it ... in a way im totally satisfied with....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE dont waste your money on serums and straightening lines of products.. get the Oil and the iron and get the natural look and enjoy the breeze flowing through and the natural movement....  who would have thought science has not been able to replicate or come close to this AGE OLD secret of the mid east and orient...  its a NO BRAINER folks... dont put a toxic dump on your hair... use this natural and far superior alternative.. I implore you!!  Lol Im pushing this product and the iron on my female friends like im selling cars...  I cant help im so excited about HSI products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are leery .. get the 5ml trial size for 5 bucks. but ill guarantee within the month you&#x27;ll be ordering a 2 or 4 oz bottle and no longer using half your products....  the best part of the oil too is it protects from heat. it also SEALS the cuticle.. silicons DO NOT.. they just weigh the hair down and build up...  the Oil is so light.. it SEEMS expensive for the amount you get.. but remember its totally natural and pure...  and iVE never come across anything like it.. also each time you use it the texture and condition of your hair gets BETTER.

    <li> This stuff is amazing. My hair has never looked so healthy! I ran out today and I will definetely buy again!</li>
    <li> From the first moment I used this product I knew I would need more bottles of it. lol&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice smell and magnificent effect on frizzy dry hairs . It makes them look shiny and healthy. I like it specially because this oil doesn&#x27;t make my hair look GREASY - the problem I had with previous oils I used to use. I like it very much.&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;A few months later:&lt;br /&gt;I reordered it and I am still satisfied with everything about it: The seller, The package, The delivery time, Everything. I even use it for my daughter&#x27;s long hair and it makes her beautiful hair even look better.</li>
    <li> I ordered this along with the HSI straightener which comes with a nice sample but I knew my daughter would like to use it as well so I just ordered a bottle at the same time. This stuff makes my hair shiny and smooth which is a first for me. I live in wet and rainy climate and it even holds up against the rain. My hair usually gets frizzy when it gets wet in the rain so I don&#x27;t think I will ever go without this stuff. I have used it both on wet hair before blow drying and dry hair before using the flat iron and my hair looks great either way. I have also read that Argon oil is great for your skin as well so I might try it.</li>
    <li> Received with HSI flat iron and this left my hair silky and easier to flat iron.  I didn&#x27;t have to use every day and my hair still stayed silky.  I have another brand of Argan Oil but it does not work like this one.  Great product and fast service</li>
    <li> Omg this is a great and wonderful product for your hair Specially if you&#x27;re straightening  your hair</li>
    <li> I have very fine, curly hair that has driven me crazy all my life. I used to get Brazilian blowouts, and loved having swingy hair with weight and movement, but got tired of spending $600 doing it and my beloved hairstylist was being poisoned by the fumes. So I went back to leaving my hair naturally curly. Naturally is a misnomer: letting my hair be &#x27;natural&#x27; requires the addition of a bunch of expensive natural products -argan, Moroccan,Bumble+Bumble, etc- just to sort of define the curls and keep my hair from poofing into the deranged poodle look it prefers. When it&#x27;s humid, I can almost hear my hair sizzle as it corkscrews and frizzles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I decided to buy a sample of this stuff for $4.95 with no intention of using it with a ceramic iron, but just to add to my hair after washing with Wen (will never go back to regular shampoo). It says to use a few drops, and I did that 2 or 3 times, because my hair is so flyaway, and I let it dry by itself after turning my head upside down and blow drying on the very lowest setting just to set it on its way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was amazed. My hair has so much more volume, it&#x27;s absolutely crazy! The curls are far more defined and plentiful. The oil is so light that it adds no weight at all, but has superb unexpected benefits. My hair bounces and has life. My curls are happier than they&#x27;ve ever been!</li>
    <li> I received my free Argan oil sample with my HSI flat iron purchase and was amazed! I have thick, dry hair that tends to frizz and this stuff is like magic!! My co-workers wanted to know what I had done different to my hair the first day I tried it! Needless to say, I immediately ordered more and will continue to do so. Love it!!</li>
    <li> Love it!  Just like everyone posted. It&#x27;s not greasy, left my hair soft and shiny.  I have very frizzy hair.  Will buy more when I run out!</li>
    <li> Love it!!  I have thick, course, abundant hair that endures abundant heat-related stress to tame.  This is one of only two products I have found that help soften and control, and I have used all the Salon products, from Chi to Moroccan Oil</li>
    <li> Works amazingly well as a detangler!  I use this on my daughter&#x27;s very thick coarse hair.  It makes her hair soft and very easy to comb.  I also used it on my relaxed hair with the same great results.  It did not leave my hair oily or greasy. Absolutely love this product!</li>
    <li> I flat iron my hair all the time &amp; this stuff makes my hair silky &amp; shiny. I loooove the smell of it &amp; I will use it all the time. I&#x27;ve tried many oils &amp; this is by far the best.</li>
    <li> Though it is a little pricey for me for a 2oz bottle,but it is worth it. This is the only product that produces the right result for my course hair when blow drying or flat ironing.  It really does leave your hair silky and shiny. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is really good for spring and summer use but I&#x27;m getting a lot of static this winter with it. I&#x27;ve never had that issue with other serums unfortunately.</li>
    <li> I have really fine  hair, so I never really needed any argon oil and I figured it would just make my hair more oily than anything else. Once I got the argan oil (comes with the straightener), I fell amazing and wondered why I hadn&#x27;t thought of getting it before! It protects your hair for the heat and leaves it silky and shiny. Right after i got it, it was pouring rain and I used it before straightening my hair, and It kept my hair extremely shiny, and SUPER soft throughout the day. And it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair really oily (like other products might). Totally worth it! Let me put it to you this way: you know those hair product commercial on name brand shampoo&#x27;s and conditioners that say \\&quot;it will make your hair stay amazing throughout the entire day?\\&quot; but you know the women&#x27;s hair is totally photoshopped since it doesn&#x27;t look real at all, well, the argan oil doesn&#x27;t make it look that shiny but it definitely makes a big noticeable difference. Hope this helps! :)</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Goes on light and makes a huge difference with how my hair looks after I style it.</li>
    <li> This product is so good, makes my hair so smoothie and shine, is the best product I ever  tried, and smells so good too... thank you so much.....</li>
    <li> This stuff is so great. A little goes a long way. I use this almost every time I style my hair, dry or wet. I definitely think it helps with heat protectant and I&#x27;m not even half way through the bottle, I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now. I also saw this reviewed on a popular beauty site recently.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Arrived as expected and priced to sell!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> Love this product! I cannot stress enough how great this stuff is! It will leave hair smooth, silky and shiny. A truly wonderful product! Thanks alot!</li>
    <li> This product smells great but also leaves the hair soft and healthy looking. It&#x27;s a bit pricy and baby oil could be used if all u want is something just to keep hair looking looking shiny. I really like it a lot however, but because of the price I may not buy as often as I&#x27;d like to...</li>
    <li> This was my time using this argan oil and I will say it was amazing! I was very skeptical about putting in oil in my Brazilian hair but I have it a try. This oil is so light and smooth. I left my hair shiny and healthy looking especially after I washed my hair I would apply it to damp hair and blow dry . My hair would look brand new. I love this product! I was so upset wen my sample I Received was all gone but I will say. I will be ordering more very very soon!</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery and easy ordering process.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using other Argan oil products with good results.  I like that the HSI brand is slightly lighter in texture but not sure it is worth the higher price yet.</li>
    <li> I used to have an in with a friend overseas who used to send me Garnier shampoo and conditioner, a type you can&#x27;t find in the States; it&#x27;s for those with hair with normal roots and dry ends.  My source dried up and I&#x27;ve been through a dozen shampoo/conditioner combos with little luck. This stuff is amazing. I use it every time I straighten my hair (which is about 2-3 times a week; I don&#x27;t do it every day). Occasionally I&#x27;ll add it to my dry hair at night to let it soak in. Make sure not to put it on your hair every single day for weeks on end, otherwise you&#x27;ll get build-up, but the product is fantastic and the buyer was prompt and packed the bottle extremely well. I had visions of a dripping and soggy oily box but that didn&#x27;t happen! Thank you, Blue Novelties! I&#x27;ll buy from you guys any day and ABSOLUTLY when I&#x27;m out of argan oil!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter as she has chemically straightened hair and needs exceptional conditioning on her hair after all of the heat used and every day wear and tear. This conditioner has exceeded our expectations, and I have also begun using the product. It leaves our hair soft and silky. I was hesitant to use it, as conditioners are usually too &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; for my hair and leave it flat and lifeless. Not this one! I would highly recommend it to anyone on the fence about trying it!</li>
    <li> I am someone with pretty fine hair that gets greasy with most products like this. However, this leaves my hair feeling very healthy and moisturized without looking greasy. I would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I was on the lookout for something to put in my hair to protect it from my flat iron and curling iron. I used to get the Brazilian Blowout (until the bad press and FDA reports about them!!!), and I used their styling products, as well. I didn&#x27;t know what I was going to replace the BB serum with, because it was the best one I had tried so far! (I&#x27;m still mourning my lost blowouts... they were AMAZING for my hair!! Too bad they are toxic! Ugh.) After shopping around and reading reviews, I decided to give the HSI Argan Oil a try, and I have been thus far very happy with it! It leaves my hair soft and shiny, and really seems to protect it while I style. I&#x27;m happy with it! :-)</li>
    <li> This product made my hair soft and shiny( made my hands soft too:)). Also I liked the fact that it has a very light scent.</li>
    <li> HSI Professional Argan Oil leave in conditioner makes my hair shiny and smooth.  It helps with the flyaway strands and frizz so that my straight hair looks glassy smooth. I wish that it came with a small pump. Other than that, it is a good product, it came quickly, and the shipping was free with Prime shipping.</li>
    <li> Helps to keep my hair moisturized....pleasant smell....a little goes a long way ...a good buy! I would buy again, though I think this bottle will last a long time!</li>
    <li> Beyond expectation! Thrilled with results. Absolutely ecstatic. Would refer friends and family. And looking forward to doing business in the future!</li>
    <li> I purchased this since all of the reviews were so good. I LOVE IT! I have curly/frizz hair and it made my soft and shiny. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have used Moroccanoil for years. I never expected any product to come close to it. although I prefer the smell of Moroccanoil, I honestly believe my hair looks and feels better after using this product. So much cheaper too. I was horribly upset when my box arrived soaked with the oil. the bottle was not closed tightly and sealed at all, so it leaked all over the box. I only have half a bottle of oil, but I do love it. I will reorder, and hopefully it was a one time problem. however, I have read other reviews with this same problem. when I contacted the company, they weren&#x27;t helpful. good product... Not the best packing or customer service.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this oil for a few weeks but I definitely recommend this Argan oil for anyone who uses flat or curling irons.  Really seems to protect my hair.</li>
    <li> This product leaves your hair soft and silky.&lt;br /&gt;I will only be using this from now on. LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I bought this oil because of all the high ratings, despite being told to only buy organic, 100% Argon Oil.  This product makes my hair frizz out.  I have a CHI blow dryer and take VERY good care of my hair (my hair is fine and thin).  I am really disappointed with this product and will be trying organic, 100% Argon Oil to see if it makes a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, a note about the brand.  When I was looking to buy a new curling iron I thought about purchasing HSI brand.  I watch a video on their website about how to get that &amp;#34;Victoria&#x27;s Secret&amp;#34; hair - full, voluptuous curls.  The video turned me off their brand immediately.  It was a tacky video and the &amp;#34;model&#x27;s&amp;#34; hair was awful.  I&#x27;ve seen better hair at my work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was taught at an early age to take care of myself and treat myself to nice things once in a while.  This product was supposed to be a treat.  I would definitely not recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this it&#x27;s great, after using this product with my HSI Flatiron it looks like I have been at a salon.</li>
    <li> It really cut the frizz, manage my family hair and it smell is amazing.  Is not that greasy, but put shines in the hair without affecting. I must try it with the iron.</li>
    <li> It leaves your hair feeling soft and silky, I will be purchasing this again. a must have if you flat iron your hair, even if you don&#x27;t. a little goes a long way. I love this product.</li>
    <li> This product makes my hair silky smooth and works really well with my new straightener.  I will definitely be recommending this to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful stuff, just a couple of drops worked into your hair, and it really shines, works great with a flat iron.  My granddaughter has really frizzy hair, looks sleek, shiny and manageable once we use this with the iron.  Well worth the price as you only use a few drops.</li>
    <li> I received this free with the purchase of a hair straightener by the same brand and boy was I pleased. I had used another brand of argan oil before but was disappointed, though I think it was mixed with something else. This leaves my hair so soft and is now part of my daily styling routine.</li>
    <li> Really love this product! My frizzy fried (bleaching/dying) hair is smooth and shiny using this and the HSI ceramic straightener.</li>
    <li> I like it a lot. It leaves my hair soft and nice. The handle has (no buttons or gadgets) that could interfere with holding it, so it makes it easy to handle.</li>
    <li> Have used many treatments and conditioners on my hair in the past to try to achieve what this product does alone. Shampooed and put the HSI Argan Oil in and my hair was tamed. Shiny,moveable, straight. I was convinced that the hype was real. Thanks Amazon for bringing your customers the very best!!mi</li>
    <li> I have only been using Argan oil for a month, but I like the way it leaves my dull, listless, grey hair looking and feeling.  I also use it on my dry skin and notice a healthier skin tone.</li>
    <li> Love it! This product really works- leaves my hair soft and manageable. Love the scent amd i know its protecting my hair</li>
    <li> HOLY HOT DOG! I have tried moroccan oil from the salon and other oils etc but wow, this is THE ONLY oil that works wonders for my hair. I put a dime size on my wet hair then another after its blow dried.</li>
    <li> I have permed hair and when I use a small amount after washing my hair, it is so soft and not frizzy at all. I am very pleased!</li>
    <li> Excellent product and excellent service!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!! You just have to use a little and it goes a long way. Some days I don&#x27;t even straighten my hair because if the weather is right this stuff is enough I live in Texas so that is saying a lot.</li>
    <li> Argon oil is always good when styling hair.And this one is good quality&lt;br /&gt;just apply some after styling hair, and your hair will never dry out,&lt;br /&gt;But I&#x27;m not sure if one should apply it before using the hairdryer and flat iron, because a stylist in Beverly hill&lt;br /&gt;Told me not to use it before exposing hair to heat, because the combination of heat and oil just frys the hair</li>
    <li> I got this product as a trial size with the purchase of my HSI ceramic tourmaline flat iron.  I have frizzy hair that needs products to make it look good.  In the past I would use no less then 5 at one time.  I decided to give this a try.  LOVE IT!  My hair is not frizzy it is soft and shinny.  It is now the only stuff I use after washing my hair.</li>
    <li> This argan oil its fantastic! Smells so good and leave my hair very soft and silky. I use it wuth wet hair and sometimes after my hair blowed dry to prevent frizz, it works wonders. Recommended.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I noticed immediately after use the instant shine and softness of my hair. I absolutely love this product. I also have the flat iron that is made by the same. Overall, great well spent purchase. Oh it is true that you do not need a lot of the oil to apply to hair. Just a little bit will do. I typicall apply a dime size amount onto my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Background on my hair: I&#x27;m an African-American, Native American and white. My hair is fine grade and I haven&#x27;t had a perm since Feb 2012. This product in conjunction with the HSI flatiron straightens my hair out better than my beauticians. Enough said :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s worth the price. It had help my thick and wavy hair stay manageable! I will definitely buy this product again!</li>
    <li> The argan oil I tried has been fantastic.  Makes my hair shiny and soft without really weighing it down too much.  Glad I got to try the sample and certainly plan on getting more once I run out.</li>
    <li> I love it. It actually helped make my hair easy to wash. Because of the over processing I&#x27;m done to my hair , this product has helped take away the wiriness that I experience every time I wash my hair.  I was able to get my fingers down into my scalp. Great product.  My hair looks fabulous after I style it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the argan oil!  It made my hair so soft and shiny!  I truly absolutely must have more!!!!</li>
    <li> it made my hair feel very soft evrytime i took my hsi flat irons to it, would be better if it was in a spray bottle though</li>
    <li> I know this stuff is expensive and the bottle isnt that big, but it does what it says, i feel like my hai is deep conditioned! this stuff is great!</li>
    <li> It absorbs easily, and leaves my hair silky smoothe. I had problems with my hair being frizzy at the ends, but not anymore!</li>
    <li> Feels very good on hair and makes hair smooth and shiny as other reviews mentioned, but it smells like grandpa&#x27;s hair oil.&lt;br /&gt;I need to return.</li>
    <li> The Argan oil does everything it&#x27;s supposed to.  It has a refreshing scent, and \\&quot;readies\\&quot; my hair for the flat iron.</li>
    <li> the HSI was suppose to include a small sample size bottle of the HSI argan oil leave in cconditioner, however i did not receive this with the flat iron&lt;br /&gt;very dissappointed!  I do hoever like the flat iron.  It leaves the hair very shiny.</li>
    <li> When I opened the package, everything was greasy, the oil spilled out. Unfortunately the bottle was slightly opened and the oil soaked through the paper box/packaging.</li>
    <li> I have thin hair but I love argan oil.  This product does not leave your hair oily with just a small dose but it leaves hair shiny.</li>
    <li> LOVED IT!! Made my hair feel wonderful, and smelled great too!</li>
    <li> purchased this product about a year ago. Used for 6 months, and the result was terrible! hair has become more dry and brittle and flogged terribly simple. summer I stopped to Use and hair recovered. I Do not know what it is from this, but now I started to Use again for over a month, I noticed all the horror again. I understood now what does it all.&lt;br /&gt;It is a pity because the smell lovely!</li>
    <li> Makes my hair much easier to style using the flat iron. I have also put it in my dry hair to help tame it. I haven&#x27;t decided if I like it as much as Morracon Oil.</li>
    <li> Love what this does to my hair! Product arrived quickly, but it did leak slightly in transit. Still, it was a great buy.</li>
    <li> This arrived packaged correctly.  I had none of the problems mentioned by others.  I think it works great with the flat iron.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different brands of Argan oils in my hair. I have thick course hair that I flat iron straight. This is by far the best oil I have used. I bought this oil based on other reviews I read here on amazon and am so glad I did. I will definitely be buying more. This is a tiny bottle but this product will go a long way.</li>
    <li> I was looking to find a product to change up with my Moroccan oil. This is really good. Lighter and less greasy than the MO if you accidentally use too much. The smell is light and almost non-existent, so I use both depending on how intense I want to hydrate my hair for the day.</li>
    <li> I gave this product 5 stars because it is not like any other &amp;#34;serum&amp;#34; for your hair, it doesnt leave the hair greasy...it smells great! And it smooths my hair and gives it a nice shine while taming the fly aways. Also i notice it seals my really bad split ends that i already had, makes them look 10x&#x27;s healthier. I will definitely be buying this oil again in the future. Btw alittle goes a LONG way :) Enjoy</li>
    <li> I heard my hairdress talking about Argan oil, but she didn&#x27;t have any on hand for me to purchase.  I bought this on a whim, and I LOVE the results.  With my straightner and this oil, I get the best results!  Only complaint is......my hair has a lot more static these days then I remember.  But with that being said......that won&#x27;t make me stop using it.  Quick shipping, good seller.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Am using it with Pureology shampoo and conditioner and a Babyliss flat iron (and Rusk hair dryer). My hair stays pretty straight even in the humidity. Yah!</li>
    <li> This is the best Argon Oil product I have tried.  Other products purchased from the store just do not compare.  Just a little bit is needed to achieve soft silky hair.  I have naturally curly, frizzy hair and have tired most every product out there.  At this time, I am no longer looking.  I have found the product that works best for me and my daughter.  Thanks HSI!</li>
    <li> Mae my hair feel greasy and I barely used a dime size. I have medium thick hair too. Disapointed it didn&#x27;t work as well as the reviews claimed</li>
    <li> The oil feels and smells delicious.  Not greasy but has enough body to leave your hair soft and bouncy. I have thick wavy hair and have tried pretty much everything out there. I&#x27;m very pick but can say that this argan oil is a winner!</li>
    <li> I RECENTLY CUT OFF 8 YEARS WORTH OF DREADS. I PERMED MY HAIR AND CUT IT SHORT. THIS PRODUCT IS GREAT , IT LEAVES MY CURLS SOFT AND MY HAIR WELL TREATED. I DO USE AT HOME AND WHEN I GO TO THE SALON. THIS IS A PRODUCT THE I WILL BE USING FOR A VERY LONG TIME.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It helps protect my hair without making it greasy. And it smells great! Would definitely recommend</li>
    <li> The test of whether something is really good or not is if you reorder it.  I have and I will continue to do so.  It&#x27;s worth the money.  I order two bottles at a time to make sure I don&#x27;t run out. For years I was cutting my hair to about an inch thinking that the straw feeling would go away with the new growth. that didn&#x27;t happen. But it did when I began using this product.  I can even wear my thick hair in a natural style and it feels soft and touchable. LOL.  I&amp;#34;m forever touching my hair in awe.</li>
    <li> I really like the smell, and it does make hair smooth and less fuzzy. I am happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff - I&#x27;ve already gone through three bottles! I typically rub a dime-sized amount into the ends of my hair after showering and style as usual. The argan oil helps in sealing split ends and keeping my hair looking healthy. The bottle design is simple and beyond easy to use. HSI is my go-to for any type of hair product.</li>
    <li> I started using this, and I am satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;Fast delivery. Good price. Until now, I could not find bad thing yet.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
    <li> I works as described in the description.  It&#x27;s a great product for keeping your hair soft and shinny.  You don&#x27;t need to put a lot either, a bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it says it does. Very quick and easy to use. Just apply a few drops to your hands and rub into your dry or wet hair and style.  Received my package promptly.</li>
    <li> This oil is nice for my dry hair. I feel like my hair stays smooth longer than when I don&#x27;t use it. It wasn&#x27;t a miracle for my dry curly hair, but my hair seems less dry after flat ironing. I do like it, I just didn&#x27;t have as amazing of results as in the reviews I read before buying.</li>
    <li> In a world full of overpriced hair products, I was hesitant to try yet another.  However, I needed a small size for a trip and this product did the trick.  It is great at helping give that \\&quot;washed my hair yesterday so it has the right amount of oil\\&quot; look and I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> This was the first time I ever ordered a product like that. I ordered it because I just got highlights and my hair felt a bit different and hard to style. Plus I wanted to USA flat iron which is an added intervention to my hair.. My hair is thin and rather oily in the roots. The oil does a great job refreshing the ends of my hair without making it oily.</li>
    <li> I gave this product 4 stars only because it is not a stand-alone styling product for naturally curly hair. With that said, it does make my hair extremely soft and manageable, without a lot of weight or greasiness.</li>
    <li> I love the argan oil I bought.I work in a production plant.It helps my hair from being so dry and leaves my hair smooth</li>
    <li> I really like this product after trying 100 different products. Makes my hair looks shiny and silky for more than 4 days. I really like and love it.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT IT MAKES MY HAIR SO SOFT AND SHINY, I WON&#x27;T USE ANY THING ELSE....</li>
    <li> I got one of these oils as a sample with my HSI flat iron and really love it. The smell is fresh and nice.</li>
    <li> The first person to try my Argan oil conditioner was a friend, who wanted help wih blow drying her hair. She has color treated hair, considerably damaged due to this chemical process of coloring she does so frequently. She always complains of how dry and brittle her hair is. As soon as she had this Argan oil leave in conditioner on her hair, we could see the difference. Her hair appeared to absorb the conditioner immediately, making it soft and looking healthier. The conditioner made the blow drying easier, and the result was a soft, shinier, healthier hair.  The funny thing is that as I am writing this review right now, I am remembering that I did not put on her hair the usual anti frizz serum. I forgot! It must be because as soon as I used to finish helping with her hair drying, I noticed the need of the serum and used it to tame the many little fly away hairs at the top of her head. This time I remember that her hair didn&#x27;t look as needing the anti frizz treatment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have just a small amount left, due to some bad luck I had when receiving my product, but I will order more for sure, since I am convinced of the good outcome when I use it on my long wavy hair. My friend&#x27;s hair is far more difficult than mine, due to her continuous coloring treatments, and this leave in conditioner passed the test with her hair easily.</li>
    <li> Light weight, smells great, leaves your hair soft and shiny. Arrived on time, you don&#x27;t have to use a lot to get the job done!!!</li>
    <li> I really like this because you can leave in the conditioner.  My hair if very fine and thin, this was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I have hair that was damaged by a perm.  This product really helps with the dryness without leaving my hair oily.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad that I got this product. This argan oil makes my hair so silky and soft and smell nice!&lt;br /&gt;My gaughter has a 4a hair and I have a straight hair, it works on both types of hair. We love it!&lt;br /&gt;Will purchase in the future again!!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice product, however when I received it I noticed the bottle was smaller than expected for the price.  I have bought similar products with 3 times more product at half price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course this is a nice product with high quality, so if you do not mind the price, go for it.  It will leave your hair very shinny and it will look healthy if you use it before you use an iron.</li>
    <li> This argon oil leaves hair soft, shiny, and adds body.  It does not leave hair looking or feeling greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I use this product in my hair with a flat iron everyday.  It gives hair body, so I don&#x27;t need any extra gels or mousse.  It doesn&#x27;t leave hair looking frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;This is the BEST product for hair.  I LOVE IT.........</li>
    <li> It works so great with the flat iron and leaves my hair super shiney.  A little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> The oil does wonders.  My hair has body and shine without the oily residue.  I have natural blonde fine hair and this is about the only product I have found that doesn&#x27;t dull it down but rather brightens it up.  I get compliments all the time on how great my hair looks.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! Has a nice faint fragrance and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair heavy or oily. It also gives my hair a healthy shine tames lightly frizzled hair too. The only drawback is that the bottle doesn&#x27;t come with a dropper, so you can easily pour too much.</li>
    <li> Makes the hair very soft and easy to use flat iron. It is not one bit greasy like most oil based hair products. Next time I&#x27;ll buy the larger size bottle.</li>
    <li> I liked it ok, only used it twice. I will use it again and will tell my friends about it.</li>
    <li> This stuff works wonders! you would think that it would be heavy oil but its so light! The product smells great! I am a person that uses a straightener every day! When you put HIs Argan oil in your hair before you straighten it, your hair comes out perfectly straight and silky and shiney, and even after using the straightener, your hair smells great! You only need about the size of a dime to cover all of your hair! I love this product and i would recommend it for all hair types!!!</li>
    <li> I tried this first when I got it as a sample and LOVED the way it made my hair shine, plus I loved the scent! I later purchased some different 100% argan oil.  I was so excited to use it on my hair but unfortunately, it made my hair look really greasy even if I only used a little bit and it did NOT smell good. Needless to say I was very disappointed, so I looked online hoping to find HSI Professional Argan Oil. When I did, I was so excited! I purchased it and will purchase again! I LOVE THIS STUFF for my hair!!  (argan oil is expensive, so I now use the 100% stuff on my dry skin...only!)</li>
    <li> I love it so much.. I keep buying it every time i need it... It really helps with the hot iron.  Prevents and repair damage.</li>
    <li> After using the free sample that came with my straightener I decided to buy the full sized bottle. It is absolutely worth every penny. I only ordered the 4 oz bottle, which is small, but it goes a long way since you only need a drop or two. This stuff instantly made my hair feel so soft and look shiny. Usually my hair looks really bad and frizzy unless I take the time to blow dry and straighten it but even just using this and doing nothing else to it makes it look almost the same; after a quick run through with my straightener, my hair looks amazing! All of my friends and co workers complemented me on how my hair looked after I started using this product. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Excellent product that comes as a gift when you purchase the flat iron. Makes hair look like it is professionally done. I would recommended this product along with the flat iron great buy!&lt;br /&gt;This item is also great for blemishes, yes have been using this on acne scars in my arms and it started to work within the first few days. A little goes a long way with this product. Many more uses!!</li>
    <li> This product was fantastic and just what I expected. I have very thick hair and leaves my hair very smooth after blowdrying and running the hot iron. The transaction as well expected date surpassed my expectation.</li>
    <li> Amazing product.  Not only does it smell fantastic, it does a great job of taming my hair.  I have long, curly hair that tends to frizz due to living in a VERY humid climate. I like to straighten my hair and with this product, I look like I have naturally straight hair.  People are always surprised when I suddenly wear my hair curly because they have no idea it is not naturally straight.  I only need a tiny amount (about the size of a dime) to work on my entire head of hair, so the bottle lasts a very long time.</li>
    <li> This product has left my hair shiny and finally healthful looking again.  I use it on my dried hair and it takes care of the rest.  Smells sooo wonderful as well.  I will definitely recommend to a friend and buy it again.</li>
    <li> There was a free sample of this with my HSI flat iron. I absolutely loved the product as a heat protectant for my hair (frizzy, brittle). Smells wonderful too. Will definitely buy some in the future.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome!!  It&#x27;s more than a protectant -- Read up on it.  I didn&#x27;t know this until I bought it, and thought:  What the heck is this stuff??  So, I Googled it, and I found out on Wiki:  It&#x27;s a plant oil.  It works great.  It smells great.  It IS great for more than just your hair -- supposedly.  Pricey, but sooo worth it!  :)</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the way my hair feels after using this, so soft and manageable. I have thick wavy hair and this along with the HSI straightener is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for. This was worth writing a review about as I have tried so many other products and none left my hair feeling this good!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this HSI Professional Argan Oil Leave In Conditioner.  The ends of my hair are not fried and it is not heavy and greasy and forcing me to wash my hair every day! I JUST LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> This is such a great product .I have such thick course dry hair and this made my hair feel like silk .You only have to use a little .I also liked the fact that you leave it in after you shampoo .</li>
    <li> This product seems to product hair well, but I do not see where it helps much in the straightening process.  It smells nice .</li>
    <li> Really enjoyed using this. Protected my hair, left it soft and smelled great.</li>
    <li> I bought this when I bought a HSI professional flat iron. This Argan oil is fantastic, smells great and makes the flat iron glide thru your strands.. Just apply a very small amount a little goes a long way,, I have had it for months now and still is not half finished. I would recommend this oil, you will be glad you bought it..&lt;br /&gt;God Bless and enjoy your Argan oil..</li>
    <li> Out of so many fake oil, this one is definitely the original one. It really work to smoother the hair.</li>
    <li> I got an information of this one from my friend. Since I use this one, my hair is getting more silky and shinny. I like this one.</li>
    <li> I could tell an immediate difference in my hair. It has helped reduce the fly away hair and has made my hair very soft and shiney. I use it everyday before i blow dry. I have even used it when my hair is dry to add a little extra control to the frizz. A little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Loved it, leaves my hair sleek and soft</li>
    <li> I ordered the HSI Flat Iron to use to make my long fine hair straight and smooth. With the HSI Flat Iron came a small packet of the HSI PROFESSIONAL Argan Oil. I tried it and the results were simply amazing. My hair was so soft and silky and glistening after applying, and drying and then flat ironing. I was impressed because it was far superior to other products I have used for the same purpose. I then ordered a 4 oz bottle of the HSI PROFESSIONAL Argan Oil and I use it daily. A small amount rubbed into the hair, brushed or combed through and then a small amount at the ends. Voila! gorgeous shimmery hair every day. It does not build up in the hair to leave an oily residue. It seems to just be absorbed into the hair and scalp. I plan to do this indefinitely. I am grateful for a product that not only makes my rather skimpy amount of fine air look fabulous, but seems to be lessening the hair fallout I have been experiencing.</li>
    <li> This oil is fantastic! I have really thin hair that is prone to split ends. This stuff is the perfect remedy. It isn&#x27;t too oily, just a soft silky shine every time!</li>
    <li> I bought this along with the HSI iron and works great. I have naturally wavy hair that I straighten every day and this keeps my hair smooth and healthy looking all day.</li>
    <li> This leaves my hair so soft and smooth. Im sold on this product and I will buy again. Just what I needed</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have used argan oil but I got a sample when I bought the HSI flat iron and liked the results so I ordered a bottle.  Makes my hair shinier and I like it much more than the &#x27;It&#x27;s a 10&#x27; I have been using.  Will definitely keep using this product along with the iron.</li>
    <li> I have curly yet chemically processed hair, this product worked magic on my hair when I first tried it. It left it so smooth and shiny and it&#x27;s not greasy at all. It has a pleasant scent but not too strong which is what I prefer. a tiny drop could go a long way so it&#x27;s definitely worth your money. I compared it with Moroccan Oil and Agadir Aragan oil and between those two this is my favorite. Buy it and you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the product, it leaves the hair more shiny, silky and smelling great</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because it works great without weighing down my fine, listless hair. Other leave-in conditioners and serums are too heavy and greasy causing my hair to go limp and unable to style. Argan oil is light and leaves my hair conditioned and also heat protected from styling tools. I would recommend this product to others who need a light weight leave-in conditioner, especially for fine hair.</li>
    <li> Using argan oil, at least a bit on your fingers and then run through the last 2/3 of your hair and especially the ends, greatly helps to condition hair any time, and especially good for those whose hair or ends tend to get dry.  Just before using your flat iron….I feel it is necessary for excellent protection and best results.  This particular argon oil is an especially good one and recommended as both a conditioner and for use when using any hot hair products including flat irons, curling irons or electric curlers.  Once you try it, you will never want to be without it.  And a very little bit goes a long way. This bottle will last you for months and months and your hair will be shiny and silky smooth.</li>
    <li> this is supposed to help with frizzy hair but my hair is still frizzy even after using a lot</li>
    <li> Oil is awesome.  I use it on my whole body and I love it.  I just mix a small amount in any cream and shazam!</li>
    <li> I have a bob hair cut...thin hair and love this product!!!  It is not greasy and leaves hair feeling&lt;br /&gt;manageble and soft</li>
    <li> So I received a little bottle of this oil with my HSI flat iron. I have to say, just a little drop works! I LOVE the smell! I don&#x27;t like to apply random oils on my hair so I did some research (ingredients) and such. For my hair, this was great. My hair was silky and shiny! It seemed protected too. I say this because I&#x27;m use to getting my hair straightened and do a yearly Japanese hair perm. It is not greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dry, frizzy, semi-wavy hair. Before using the HSI flat iron or straightening your hair, I applied a little of the oil on my hair. Make sure you spread it nicely, especially the roots and tips. You can also do it in layers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used different oils before and I have to say this is my new favorite! :) This is a big bottle. It&#x27;ll last for a LONG time! It&#x27;s worth the buy in many ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL:DR; It&#x27;s worth the buy! It works great and smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> This little bottle does wonders.  You dont need a whole lot, which is great because even though it is oil it doesnt leave your hair greasy and it smells great!  Takes good care of the frizz and makes my hair smell divine.  Awesome product and a must buy!</li>
    <li> This HSI Argan Oil is great stuff.  A little goes a long way so I am sure this bottle will last me a long time!  It is not greasy at all.  Just use a pea size or less and put it on your ends.  I love it!!!!!  I plan on purchasing again!!!</li>
    <li> Product is very nice. A little goes a long way. Make my hair soft, smooth and shiny.</li>
    <li> didnt really  make any difference .  waste of money</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I&#x27;ve tried so many and love this one and it smell so nice too.  Will order more!!</li>
    <li> I really like the way this product smells.  My hair is shiny and healthy looking when I use it.  I have thick hair and I apply this product to wet hair because it helps to speed up the drying process with a blow dryer.</li>
    <li> What can I say but AMAZING.  I love the feel, the smell, I get customers standing next to me at work and say I love the smell of your hair.  Makes it silky shiny.</li>
    <li> In the past, I’ve tried Argan Oil, but they’ve all felt really greasy and made my hair very oily. However, with the HSI Professional Argan Oil, I do not have those issues. It is ultra-light, non-greasy and residue-free. The Argan Oil is a leave-in treatment that is good for all hair types and helps to make the hair shiny, silky and healthy looking. It’s great to use before using a hair straightener or dryer, as it creates extra thermal protection. It tames the frizziness and makes your hair smell lovely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the HSI Professional Argan Oil for many months now and I’m really impressed with the product. My hair is feeling much softer. And it’s looking healthier too. When I get out of the shower, I apply a generous amount of the Argan Oil to my hair and then put it up in a towel and let all the excess water soak out from it. If I need a little more once a lot of water has soaked from my hair, I’ll add some more. Probably one of my favorite things about the Argan Oil is the way it makes my hair smell. It has an awesome scent – I don’t even know how to describe it. But, it’s wonderful! The scent lasts for a really long time, too, and doesn’t compete with the products that I used to wash my hair with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I’m very happy with this product and would definitely recommend it to everyone. You will not regret using it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I was sent the HSI Professional Argain Oil in exchange for my honest opinion. However, all the opinions expressed here are my own.*</li>
    <li> This product it SO perfect for straightening my thick wavy hair without making it to oily or weighed down, I can go 48 hours between washes when using this product.</li>
    <li> Hsi professional argan oil leave in conditioner, is by far the absolute best purchase I&#x27;ve ever made.. leave your hair so incredibly soft, the shine is unbelievable, leaves your hair feeling like silk.. I recommend this to women everywhere, you will be amazed.. do not hesitate order this product, you will not be disappointed, trust me.. you will love it as much as I do, I guarantee it:)</li>
    <li> The HSI Professional Argan Oil leave-in conditioner is by far the BEST hair product I have ever used! My hair has never been as silky and manageable as it is using this product. The company included a free sample of the argan oil with my flat iron purchase, and I am definitely ordering a big bottle because I do not want to ever style my hair without it!!!  I would highly recommend this product!!!</li>
    <li> I used this several times; with a fresh perm--worked well. With nappy black hair, not so well. It&#x27;s like it puts a sealer on your hair, when I washed it, it seemed like it was still in my hair after the wash. I have other products similar to this and I have to use more but I do use less. I will not purchase this again. It appears to work for some.</li>
    <li> Using this oil has changed my flat ironing experience. I love love it! Shipping was quick and product is amazing. Will definitely continue purchasing this item.</li>
    <li> Definitely works, but the bottle is really little! I put it on before for protection and after to tame the frizzies.</li>
    <li> Argan oil is the perfect final touch up for your hair as it adds shine without making it look greasy.  It is also great to use as a protector against curling irons and straighteners.  It just gives your hair a more finished look and I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I am African American and this oil works miracles. This oil is also safe to apply lightly to weaves and all! Great product, a little goes a long way. The bottle is a descent size to should last 6 months to a year. GREAT PRODUCT. Cons- Do not over use makes her to oily!&lt;br /&gt;I also have to HSI Black professional flat irons so it came with a sample and I feel in-love it was like a match made in hair heaven! :)</li>
    <li> The product came in just a couple of days.  It exceeded my expectations.  I have very dry, color treated hair which is further dried by the sun here in SC - the first time I put the oil on, my hair lost the frizzies and is so soft to the touch.  I highly recommend this oil.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical to use argon oil because I&#x27;ve never heard of it, I&#x27;m very particular about the products I put in my hair but this is AMAZING , I&#x27;ve also let other woman who compliment my hair let them what product am using because I want to share the wealth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an amazing product and am so glad I got a free sample so that I was able to test it out.</li>
    <li> yes it&#x27;s a bit expensive as hair products go but the quality is unbeatable. I bought this and the Remmington flat iron both from Amazon and the combo is amazing. I usually wait until my hair is dry to flat iron it as it usually stays frizzy otherwise - but with this, it was smooth and shiny even without being fully dried first. I have very coarse hair so I use more than most people would, but I recommend this on most of your hair and then gel at the roots to avoid getting greasy. I am very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I have very thick and curly hair.  It protects my hair and gives it a nice shine.  A great value, too!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product!  I cannot believe the difference it has made in my hair.  My hair is dry, naturally curly and tends to be frizzy.  This product has revolutionized hair care for people like me!  People are asking me where I get my hair done, what different have I done to it and how beautiful it looks.  I cannot be more pleased with this product, it is simply amazing.  It&#x27;s like a miracle to me, because now my hair is sleek and shiny and it has NEVER been this way since I was a teenager!  I have found a product for LIFE!  This is the best thing to ever come out for people with dry, lifeless, frizzy hair.  It is just wonderful!  Love love LOVE it!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product shortly after having my hair cut and styled.  I wanted to achieve the same softness and drape in my hair that my hairdresser got (which my hair does not do naturally).  I was extremely pleased that I got exactly what I wanted!  This product gives you softness, control, and no frizziness!  I will continue to buy this product and I have already recommended it to my friends.  Thank you HSI!</li>
    <li> I have used a multitude of name brand products on my wavy hair and this product is magical when I dry my hair straight it has so much body!!  Also used it for my wavy look and it was not frizzy like other times when i put other expensive products in my hair.  I truly recommend trying this it is a miracle in a bottle!!</li>
    <li> Love it. Makes your hair look and feel healthy. Just started using it so I&#x27;m hoping to see results of less breakage soon</li>
    <li> Small bottle, but makes my hair shine!  It&#x27;s excellent to use on dry or wet hair and seems to protect from styling.</li>
    <li> I love this product. The flat iron just glides over my hair. It is not sticky and leaves my curls soft. It has a nice scent too.</li>
    <li> I have long bleached hair and this product is wonderful with both flat iron and curling tools.  Applied to the end of the hair it makes split ends disappear and the rest of the hair, shiny and smooth.  I&#x27;ve gotten lots of compliments on my hair since using it.</li>
    <li> My daughter uses this product while straightening her hair with a flat iron and when she&#x27;s done straightening, her hair appears shiny, not greasy, and stick straight to boot!</li>
    <li> I have dry curly hair so a good thermal conditioner is essential for me.  This oil works goes on very easily with good results.  My hair feels soft and it is shiny.  I would recommend this to others.  I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a month so I can&#x27;t speak to long term results.</li>
    <li> I love this argan oil.  I really love the smell.  I also love how it makes my hair so soft and silky with the HSI Iron :].  I just put a couple drops in my hand and make sure my ends have enough oil and it comes out fantastic after I&#x27;m finished with my hair.</li>
    <li> I have used this oil on my hair and it gave my hair life again plus it protects it from the amount of heat I put in my hair!</li>
    <li> great oil for hair, leaves hair smooth and beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;Only gave 4 star, because on the bottle I have the isn&#x27;t any form of dropper.</li>
    <li> Return to Sent Items&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Thank you from Amazon customer melody clark (Order: 115-7953140-7665828)&lt;br /&gt; From: melody clark (clarkmelody@hotmail.com)&lt;br /&gt; Sent: Wednesday, April 1, 2015 7:00 AM&lt;br /&gt; To: Blue Novelties&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Order ID: 115-7953140-7665828&lt;br /&gt;•1 of HSI PROFESSIONAL Argan Oil LEAVE IN CONDITIONER flat iron thermal protector leaves hair silky and shiny 2oz BOTTLE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE THIS PRODUCT AND IT WORKS VERY WELL IN MY HAIR. THE PRICE IS COMPETIVE AND WORTH IT. THANKS</li>
    <li> I was pleased with the quick response to ship. But I am most pleased with the Argan oil conditioner. My hair looks &amp; feels fantastic.</li>
    <li> I have used the expensive Moroccan Oil product from salons before with great results.  This product is just as good if not better (I like the scent of this one better.  I find it to be pleasant but subtle).  The cost can&#x27;t be beat. I will never pay $40 for a 3 oz bottle of Moroccan oil again.</li>
    <li> I really wanted this product because of the number of remarkably high reviews. I&#x27;ve just started flat ironing my hair and I need something that really works and prevents heat damage and also leaves my hair feeling and looking great. This product sounded perfect. I ordered a couple of hair related items in the same order. Everything was supposed to arrive together, but when I received my package, the HSI thermal protector product was not in there. I contacted Amazon.com&#x27;s customer service and was told,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; \\&quot;I&#x27;ve checked your order details and see it was placed with Blue Novelties, a seller on our website. Because Blue Novelties inventory is constantly changing, we can&#x27;t replace items sold by them that are Fulfilled by Amazon. I hope you&#x27;ll understand our limitations. I realize this has caused you inconvenience, and I hope you will accept my apologies.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was VERY upset because I was going out of town on vacation and I really needed all of my stuff to come that I had ordered. I got a refund, but I needed the product. So yeah, that was ridiculous. How does a seller forget to send the item you ordered? Then I can&#x27;t get it sent out because it might not be available? SMH.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!  I have very curly African American hair and this oil works very well with it.  It makes combing a breeze and it does not leave my hair feeling greasy and heavy.  I love this so much I sent some to my sister and she says she loves it too.  I would definitely recommend giving this oil a try.</li>
    <li> I had read incredible reviews of this product. I don&#x27;t really even notice I&#x27;ve used it. It does nothing bad but also nothing good. I think it is just a waste.</li>
    <li> This oil is perfect, reaaally perfect. I&#x27;m not usually so taken away with hair products. I tried a LOT of serums and none has gave me such a nice effect: smooth and light hair, easy to straighten or just keep natural. I loved it so much that I talk about it to my friends and they love it too now. It also has this amazing smell that reminds me of something in my childhood :) yes, not relevant for a review, but still relevant for me :)&lt;br /&gt;I have voluminous, curly and kind of savage, unruly hair and this oil I discovered through a minuscule sample I got when I bought the HSI straightener, makes me love my crazy mane :)</li>
    <li> I accidentally discovered this product when a sample size was included with a purchase of flat iron.  When I ran out of the sample size and went a week without using the Argan oil, I realized what a difference it made and found this size container on Amazon. Even when I am not using a flat iron for styling, this oil makes such a difference in the shine and and control of my hair. It is a keeper.</li>
    <li> Got my hair bleached and I thought I would end up bald but this little bottle is magical. Just a few drops and your hair feels silky and smooth. Love it.</li>
    <li> My hair feels super soft after using this product. It leaves my hair shiny and protects it from styling damage. Its a great product. Much better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It makes my hair easier to straighten and leaves my hair soft and silky.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite products</li>
    <li> This oil makes my hair feel great and it works well with the flat iron.it make my hair feel soft without being to oily. I&#x27;m really glad I came across this product.</li>
    <li> I love this product, one of the best!</li>
    <li> Use this with the styler and they complement each other nicely.  Would recommend this item if you use a flat iron on your hair in order to prevent damage.</li>
    <li> This oil does not make my hair feel greasy and it has a great smell. My hair gets dry on the ends and this product really works well for that.</li>
    <li> The argan oil works well on my hair.  I used the oil prior to curling my hair with the HSI curling iron.  My hair was soft.  Oil is not greasy and gives the hair a nice shine.</li>
    <li> I never used HSI Argan Oil before until I purchased my flat iron and a sample was free with it. Thank you HSI for that. It is the best product I have ever use on my hair. My hair has never shined so much with using this oil and a flat iron. When my sample was gone, I purchased the 4oz bottle. Try this!! You will have no regrets!!</li>
    <li> I have used several other hair care products ever since I started using a flat iron and none compare to this product!  A small sample of this oil was included in with my HSI flat iron.  I was amazed with how soft and shiny it made my hair.  My hair remains soft even after using the flat iron and keeps my hair style in place all day.  No frizz!  I had to get a bigger bottle!  This oil is a must have!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best oil I have ever had, it works great on my hair, full of shine without the access oil in ur hair, such a great product</li>
    <li> Love this oil. I flat iron my hair every single day... although it is not my hair LOL!&lt;br /&gt;I wear extensions. Although the hair is not mine it is still human and can still be damaged with daily styling. I use the oil every single day prior to flat ironing. It keeps it soft and shiny and very healthy looking. It doesnt take much at all so i expect this bottle to last me at least 2 months or more. I will definetly purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I have very thick frizzy hair, and this product helps make my hair straight n shiny. Another thing I really like is that you can use this on wet or dry hair, which I absolutely LOVE. I would recommend this product to all my friends!</li>
    <li> my daughter has dry damaged hair and loves to flat iron her hair to exclude any waves, for her birthday she asked for a flat iron and knew she needed a heat protected to help from further damage, this not only helps but SMELLS GREAT</li>
    <li> This Argan Oil leaves my hair shinny and super soft, it does not add weight to it. A small bottle goes a long way, you don&#x27;t even need a lot of it for a medium to long hair like mine in each application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend it. You&#x27;ll love the results. :)</li>
    <li> This Argan Oil made my hair soft and silky. If you flat iron your hair I recommend using this product. It&#x27;s non greasy and I will always get it. :)</li>
    <li> Great product.. was so happy with it, i decided to get me two more bottles.  With just a few drops on damp hair it leaves it silky and smooth after flat ironing.</li>
    <li> Great little product. bought this to use with some new curling irons. I actually just use this every other day after I wash my hair. It adds amazing shine and moisture. Leaving my hair soft and silky.</li>
    <li> I usually have a specific product i use to keep my hair shiny and a seperate one for heat protecting. This oil gives you 2 in 1! Not to mention you dont need to use a ton! It left me hair so silky and smooth, will def purchase again! I might also add that i bought this product without ever having used it before simply based on reviews and i was not expecting such fantastic results! Just buy it, you will not be disappointed! I would like to mention that the oil was also shipped first so that i may recieve part of my order faster! Which was wonderful!</li>
    <li> Loved the sample bottle so much that I ended up getting this bottle! Makes my hair very smooth and shiny and you only need a small amount (I have very thick frizzy hair.) I can see this bottle lasting a while. I find it works better than the Moroccan oils too.</li>
