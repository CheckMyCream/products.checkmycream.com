      <li>It is a good size bottle.</li>

      <li>Cheap prices too!!</li>
      <li>Amazing amazing amazing</li>
      <li>so I kind of knew what I was getting.  </li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s so nice</li>
      <li>I used it with my ASP powder and it worked nicely.</li>
      <li>Amazing product, inexpensive but works smoothly just like the salon used acrylic liquid!</li>
      <li>It came in a very timely manner which I absolutely loved!</li>
      <li>You&#x27;re better off going to Sally&#x27;s or another beauty supply shop instead of buying chemicals online.</li>
      <li>I was able to redo a couple of nails at night without the over powering smell of nail liquid.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>but it was more like a jello constancy and</li>
      <li>Overall, a good buy and a great price.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure of it</li>
      <li>am going to order more love</li>
      <li>Love this product and will be buying more.</li>
      <li>I purchase this monomer in hopes that it would work better than another brand I used before, and to my surprise and excitement, it does.  </li>
      <li>I love it , will buy it again  </li>
      <li>Everything was great, shipped fast.</li>
      <li>my granddaughter love this</li>
      <li>This is actually pretty good.</li>
      <li>works great and cheap for how much you get</li>
      <li>delivery was very very fast very very happy so far :)</li>
      <li>I received it very quickly.</li>
      <li>The liquid smells strong like it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m hoping it will be just fine.</li>
      <li>Good product so far</li>
      <li>most 1oz bottles go for at least $6 in the beauty supply stores so this is a great buy!!</li>
      <li>It works exactly as it says it does, and comes out a nice consistency when mixed with the acrylic powder, drying to a nice crystal-clear finish...</li>
      <li>Not bad, does tend to not adhere as well as it could</li>
      <li>so it came quick.</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast too so that was a bonus!!</li>
      <li>It does have a powerful smell</li>
      <li>It was delivered very fast ..</li>
      <li>but I think thats the same with most monomers.</li>
      <li>and this was one of the first things I recieved.</li>
      <li>the only brand I use love this stuff</li>
      <li>Exactly as described.</li>
      <li>This product works very well.</li>
      <li>I really like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t leave a lingering odor, it does smell</li>
      <li>I got it so fast in my mail</li>
      <li>next time, it&#x27;s probably worth the price difference at this point.</li>
      <li>When I do acrylics I have to go outside because this will light up your entire house.</li>
      <li>I have started doing my own nails rather than going and paying ridiculous rates at nail salons</li>
      <li>Complete trash!</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry fast and is very manageable.</li>
      <li>A little cheap but gets the job done.</li>
      <li>Opened it up today and BAM the product is old and contaminated.</li>
      <li>haven&#x27;t used it yet still using my old one</li>
      <li>nice size too -- much larger than the tiny bottles they sell at the drugstore, yet not a huge gallon jug that would last 2 lifetimes!</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry too fast like some I have used.</li>
      <li>I have bought many other brands in the past and this is by far the best.i will only buy this product from now on</li>
      <li>I like how it works and so far stays clear as was expected.</li>

<li> So it last a long time.</li>
<li> It seems like it might be by just a little bit, but it still stinks up the room pretty badly and will eventually give me a headache if I&#x27;m taking too long doing my acrylics, even if I try to make sure I replace the top in between dipping my brush.</li>
<li> Just as well as other, more expensive brands.</li>
<li> This is also another product I purchased that some reviews stated was way smaller than expected.  </li>
<li> this solution is knock you out crazy strong...</li>
<li> I would and plan to order this again along with an acrylic powder of the same brand or one at least similar.</li>
<li> so much , I like Mia secret brand</li>
<li> It was like someone had switched it out with watered down liquid..</li>
<li> I tried to water it down with another liquid,  and it just sank to the bottom.  </li>
<li> I bought this because I hoped it would be less smelly than using the Kiss brand liquid monomer.</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t smell up my room like other Acrylic nail liquids have done in the past.</li>
<li> I will definitely purchase this monomer by Mia Secret before I run out.</li>
<li> Money wasted.</li>
<li> There are others on Amazon that work well and do not smell nearly this bad.</li>
<li> Anyway when I received this (Mia Secret Peofessional Acrylic Nail System Liquid Monomor 2 oz)  </li>
<li> I have been weak dizzy feeling really really weird</li>
<li> Waste of money!!!!</li>
<li> I just realized THIS GARBAGE IS WHAT HAS BEEN MAKING ME SICK FOR WEEKS.</li>
<li> the smell is sickening and my throat has been hurting and I&#x27;ve been feeling like I just stepped out of an elevator all wobbly.</li>
<li> I bought this because The stuff I got at the store (No lift nails, acrylic nail liquid) was horrible..</li>
<li> Horrible!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Exactly as described.</li>
    <li> It was wonderful. It doesn&#x27;t dry fast and is very manageable. Great for beginner nail technicians. Must buy!!! Cheap prices too!!</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t used it yet still using my old one but I&#x27;m hoping it will be just fine.</li>
    <li> This product works very well. Just as well as other, more expensive brands. A fair price also.  I would definately purchase again!</li>
    <li> YEEEESSSSSS! BUY IT, SHIPS IN 4 DAYS</li>
    <li> Very good, acrylics look greAt when using this product.</li>
    <li> I purchase this monomer in hopes that it would work better than another brand I used before, and to my surprise and excitement, it does.  It doesn&#x27;t dry too fast like some I have used. Of course it smells, but I find the smell does not linger if you are close to open windows. Air fresheners do the trick.  I will definitely purchase this monomer by Mia Secret before I run out.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I received it very quickly.</li>
    <li> Horrible! This is supposed to be liquid but it was more like a jello constancy and nothing dripped out. I tossed it! Don&#x27;t buy this</li>
    <li> This is also another product I purchased that some reviews stated was way smaller than expected.  However,  I compared some items at home at home to the size dimensions they had so I kind of knew what I was getting.  At the same time, like the powder I purchased, you don&#x27;t have to use a lot at all to get the job done. So it last a long time.</li>
    <li> It came in a very timely manner which I absolutely loved! I ordered something from ebay weeks before I ordered this and this was one of the first things I recieved. I have not got to use it yet because I am waiting on my powders and nails which were shipped from a different company. It is a good size bottle.</li>
    <li> I have prine so it came quick. It does have a powerful smell but I think thats the same with most monomers. Anyone who complains about lifting probably isnt using a primer.</li>
    <li> It is a good product, dies not smell as string as others I used before, good price, very good quality after you are done doing your part, I will get again when I run out.</li>
    <li> I got my package today I opened it and everything was great. The liquid smells strong like it&#x27;s supposed to. Love it. Even though took a lil while to get here but deff would buy again! 😌</li>
    <li> The substance was gooey and I couldn&#x27;t even use it!!! Had to trash this item! Waste of money!!!! DO NOT BUY!!! You&#x27;re better off going to Sally&#x27;s or another beauty supply shop instead of buying chemicals online.</li>
    <li> Not bad, does tend to not adhere as well as it could</li>
    <li> This is a great monomer liquid. And the price was wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A nice size too -- much larger than the tiny bottles they sell at the drugstore, yet not a huge gallon jug that would last 2 lifetimes! LOL</li>
    <li> I have bought many other brands in the past and this is by far the best.i will only buy this product from now on</li>
    <li> this is a great deal because of the price! most 1oz bottles go for at least $6 in the beauty supply stores so this is a great buy!!</li>
    <li> It was delivered very fast .. great Seller.. I bought this because The stuff I got at the store (No lift nails, acrylic nail liquid) was horrible.. It was like someone had switched it out with watered down liquid.. Anyway when I received this (Mia Secret Peofessional Acrylic Nail System Liquid Monomor 2 oz)  I noticed that it did the job it was supposed to do.. I am very pleased with the results..</li>
    <li> I love it , will buy it again  , it&#x27;s so nice , i like this liquid  so much , I like Mia secret brand</li>
    <li> Love this product and will be buying more. I have started doing my own nails rather than going and paying ridiculous rates at nail salons and I don&#x27;t drill my nails until they don&#x27;t exist. This stuff is great and works a lot better than what you can buy at WalMart in the DIY kits.</li>
    <li> very good quality for the price!  it is very expensive in europe , so i was very pleased of that monomer.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell up my room like other Acrylic nail liquids have done in the past. I was able to redo a couple of nails at night without the over powering smell of nail liquid. I really like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t leave a lingering odor, it does smell but it doesn&#x27;t leave my room smelling like a nail salon and thats a plus!</li>
    <li> I havent got to use this idem yet but i must say im happy with the size of the bottle was a good deal for me. delivery was very very fast very very happy so far :)</li>
    <li> Bought this in February.  Shipping was timely.  I attempted to use it today and couldn&#x27;t. It has a gooey consistency, almost like Elmers glue. I tried to water it down with another liquid,  and it just sank to the bottom.  Money wasted.</li>
    <li> I got it so fast in my mail am going to order more love it I do recommended</li>
    <li> my granddaughter love this</li>
    <li> I bought this because I hoped it would be less smelly than using the Kiss brand liquid monomer. It seems like it might be by just a little bit, but it still stinks up the room pretty badly and will eventually give me a headache if I&#x27;m taking too long doing my acrylics, even if I try to make sure I replace the top in between dipping my brush. It works exactly as it says it does, and comes out a nice consistency when mixed with the acrylic powder, drying to a nice crystal-clear finish... But I think I&#x27;ll just go ahead and buy an odorless monomer like Opi Clarite next time, it&#x27;s probably worth the price difference at this point.</li>
    <li> This is actually pretty good. I used it with my ASP powder and it worked nicely. It set up the powder really good when I use my dual forms. Overall, a good buy and a great price. Shipping was fast too so that was a bonus!!</li>
    <li> works great and cheap for how much you get</li>
    <li> This product came before the delivery dates which is amazing! It is filled up all the way and a very good product! Recommended for beginners!</li>
    <li> I just realized THIS GARBAGE IS WHAT HAS BEEN MAKING ME SICK FOR WEEKS. I have to get rid of it. I have been weak dizzy feeling really really weird and it is this stuff I&#x27;m sure of it it started when I used this. the smell is sickening and my throat has been hurting and I&#x27;ve been feeling like I just stepped out of an elevator all wobbly.</li>
    <li> this solution is knock you out crazy strong...When I do acrylics I have to go outside because this will light up your entire house. There are others on Amazon that work well and do not smell nearly this bad.</li>
    <li> the only brand I use love this stuff</li>
    <li> Works well, even with different brand powders!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used this one yet. I will come back later to let you all know about it. I can tell you that I did choose it for price</li>
    <li> Awesome! Product is just as great as going to the salon. No lifting of mail. I would give this a Ten!</li>
    <li> Item was delivered earlier than I thought. I like how it works and so far stays clear as was expected.</li>
    <li> Works great, but is pungent</li>
    <li> Good product! I was a beginner and I choose this product to do my nails. I have not switched!</li>
    <li> Amazing product, inexpensive but works smoothly just like the salon used acrylic liquid! A+</li>
    <li> A little cheap but gets the job done.</li>
    <li> This is what my nail tech used for years. Since learning how to do my own nails, it still seems to render the best results.</li>
    <li> very good doesnt give me headache from smell i will order again works well with various powders</li>
    <li> Amazing amazing amazing, I&#x27;m finding Mia to be one of the best products I&#x27;ve ever used couldn&#x27;t be happier</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. Everything was great, shipped fast. Opened it up today and BAM the product is old and contaminated. The monomer has turned to GEL. Complete trash!</li>
    <li> Good product so far and i received it promptly. I would and plan to order this again along with an acrylic powder of the same brand or one at least similar.</li>
