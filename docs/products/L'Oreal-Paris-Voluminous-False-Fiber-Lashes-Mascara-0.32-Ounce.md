### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>THIS IS THE BEST MASCARA EVER!  </li>
      <li>I prefer L&#x27;Oreal telescopic mascara that one is the best...!</li>
      <li>The best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>I use two coats and it&#x27;s perfect.  </li>
      <li>I AM SOOOO THRILLED WITH THIS FIND!!!</li>
      <li>I have used L&#x27;Oreal Voluminous mascara for years and I truly believe it is one of the all time best mascaras on the market.  </li>
      <li>no amount of lash curling could counteract the weight of this formula, which would turn perfectly perky and curled lashes into pin-straight fringe within seconds of coating lashes.</li>
      <li>I recommend using this with another mascara for best results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>L&#x27;Oreal mascaras are in my opinion, some of the best that you can find at the drugstore.</li>
      <li>The best feature of this mascara, however, is the brush itself.</li>
      <li>BEST MASCARA EVER.&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
      <li>but i am very happy now.</li>
      <li>The wand is wonderful (though a bit longer than I am used to</li>
      <li>Another thing that is really impressive to me is that this mascara holds your curl ALL DAY!  </li>
      <li>The volume and and length are incredible.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m always happy with the results.  </li>

      <li>Try it, it will make your eyes look amazing!</li>
      <li>Although I love L&#x27;Oreal products, this was not the best mascara I&#x27;ve tried.</li>

      <li>It makes your lashes huge and separates them great.</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping and great product!</li>
      <li>If you apply one coat, you get a nice, almost every-day type of look.  </li>
      <li>It can be kind of clumpy</li>
      <li>THIS STUFF IS POWERFUL!!!</li>
      <li>I got the mascara for a great deal but wouldn&#x27;t purchase it for full price.</li>
      <li>Of course I would buy it again until loreal has a new mascara because they are the best out there.</li>
      <li>It wears well throughout the day and comes off very easily with non-oily eye makeup remover.  </li>
      <li>l&#x27;oreal has by far the best mascara products when it comes to volume.</li>
      <li>After using this WOW wonderful lashes.</li>
      <li>It delivers everything it promises, and more.</li>
      <li>Price is much better here than &amp;#34;out there&amp;#34; too.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>My favorite mascara ever</li>
      <li>works better than the rest.tried them all</li>
      <li>Loreal is more volumizing but had no staying power.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never had any issues with Maybelline, but wanted to see if I could find something that worked better.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>This brand when I bought from the drugstore was much better quality than the ones I&#x27;d get from Amazon.</li>
      <li>I love this mascara.</li>
      <li>I used to love this mascara, but it isn&#x27;t doing it for me anymore.</li>
      <li>free to let me know any questions or comments!</li>
      <li>I have used many, many kinds of mascara, both drug store brands as well as department store brands.  </li>
      <li>I used it over my mascara and used 2 coats anything more than that</li>
      <li>LOVE them.</li>
      <li>Love this mascara.</li>
      <li>but if I use the eyelash curler the look of my eyelashes are even more stand out.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was hesitant on buying but, so glad I did.</li>
      <li>Favorite mascara of all time.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I would wear this more for evenings than day time wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love this mascara.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a lengthening drug store mascara, buy Neutrogena Healthy Lengths.</li>
      <li>It was ok</li>
      <li>Better at the lengthening though.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this mascara</li>
      <li>Be sure the scrape the excess on the sides of the tube before use.</li>
      <li>Okay, I have been using Latisse for about 6 months</li>
      <li>Glad I tried this one.</li>
      <li>This is so much more convenient and faster for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The name is appropriate, as I think it does make my lashes look fuller than my previously-used brand.</li>
      <li>so I poked myself in the eye lol), but it seems that there isn&#x27;t much product in the container.  </li>
      <li>The formula is okay.</li>
      <li>I love the design of the brush, which is encased by a beautiful gold tone exterior that looks and feels classy.  </li>
      <li>The overall look isn&#x27;t clumpy but smooth looking which I am very happy with</li>
      <li>wand isn&#x27;t very good either because you can easily get the mascara on your eyes if not careful.</li>
      <li>The mascara formula is fine, but the brush is not my favorite.</li>
      <li>I like a fine brush that separates my lashes so that each lash is appropriately coated.</li>
      <li>There are better products out there, like the original Voluminous Mascara by L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s only good for about 2 weeks, and then move on to something else!</li>
      <li>Dries up very quick, but it&#x27;s an alright product still</li>
      <li>Lengthens lashes and washes off easily, priced competitively.</li>
      <li>What clumps it does produce are easily worked out.</li>
      <li>Of ALL of the mascaras that I have tried in my life, (which is about 20 years now, &amp; I am a makeup \\&quot;junky\\&quot;), the best mascaras that I have used &amp; always stick to or go back to are: Loreal Lash Out Mascara (regular original formula), CoverGirl Remarkable Washable Waterproof Mascara, and Avon Mark Scanda-Lash Mascara (all of which I always purchase in Black/Brown).  </li>
      <li>Overall, it;s a great purchase.</li>
      <li>And as any girl knows, the brush is just as important as the mascara itself.</li>
      <li>I wash my face with [[ASIN:B004DK79A2 Neutrogena Naturals Cleanser + Makeup Remover, Fresh Cleansing, 6 oz.]] and have no need to use an oily eye makeup remover to remove this mascara, I love</li>
      <li>This is a fantastic product - I always get the waterproof, because I have watery eyes.  </li>
      <li>This is such a great mascara.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My favorite mascara ever and I have tried alot!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have long eyelashes anyway. After using this WOW wonderful lashes. Also doesn&#x27;t break off my lashes.</li>
    <li> It definitely does make lashes long and thick. The only con is that it clumps. Even after I separated the lashes with a needle, it was a little clumpy. I don&#x27;t regret the purchase though.</li>
    <li> It is not a bad mascara,the brush is ok,looks good when you put it on,but made my eyes swell really badly.I had to get treatment for several days.I am allergic person,but never had problems with any other Loreal products.</li>
    <li> Favorite mascara of all time. I have it on a subscription</li>
    <li> love this mascara! makes your lashes so much longer and fuller! Great product and I would highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> The best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> It actually separates my eyelashes, making them look thicker and longer. It doesn&#x27;t crumbles as other mascara. Definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> I AM SOOOO THRILLED WITH THIS FIND!!! I have tried all kinds of mascaras...from low end to high end, and actually have taken a 2 year break from mascara because I have hardly any lashes and had given up hope. What&#x27;s the point of wearing mascara if it doesn&#x27;t do anything for you????    Saw this mascara on sale at cvs. Thought I&#x27;d give it a go, and low and behold, I have more than hope now....I HAVE EYELASHES!!! My expectation for anyone who has normal length lashes, that this would indeed give you the look of false lashes. THIS STUFF IS POWERFUL!!!</li>
    <li> I admit, I did not purchase this, I won it from the L&#x27;Oreal facebook giveaway. Thank goodness I didn&#x27;t buy this! This is a pricey drugstore mascara, and not worth it! I&#x27;ll start with the good though. I really liked the brush, I was happy to see it wasn&#x27;t plastic! The color is nice-a very rich black. I also like that the cap clicks into place when you close it. I like knowing that it&#x27;s fully closed so that it doesn&#x27;t dry out. The bad however...way, way way too much product comes out. I had to wipe off the wand before using it, and an amazing amount would still be left! After a few hours, the formula flaked on me, which I was surprised about. I had only used it for a month before the formula got very clumpy and messy. I wanted to like this, but honestly, i&#x27;m happy it was free.</li>
    <li> This is my first ever online review, but I am actually so mad about throwing away a brand new mascara that I felt I had to do something.  This mascara is clumpy and takes a while to put on in the first place, but the worst part is that I constantly have to go use eye makeup remover under my eyes because it runs so much.  Everytime I look in the mirror I have dark circles under my eyes!  I have switched lotions, foundations, and eye cream so it is not that.  I would not recommend this mascara.</li>
    <li> It does not really look like \\&quot;false lashes\\&quot; to me but it is good and I use it. Creates a dramatic look. I still have to put some effort to separate clumps after I apply.</li>
    <li> So...I really wanted this mascara to work. I hate paying money for cosmetics that aren&#x27;t even usable...and this isn&#x27;t usable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me back up-I didn&#x27;t buy this from Amazon. I got it in a drug store...but I had to write a review-which is something I rarely do-because it was so bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expected this to be like the other products in the Voluminous line. I love the other mascaras. LOVE them. But this...from the second I pulled the wand from the container, the fibers were flying. And the fibers aren&#x27;t tiny-they&#x27;re big enough to pluck from the wand-probably a good centimeter or two. That&#x27;s scary when we&#x27;re talking about putting that next to your eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, there&#x27;s no way to keep this stuff from clumping. None. It&#x27;s a big wet sticky clumpy mess. I agree with \\&quot;Holy Clumps Batman\\&quot; because it feels like stage makeup, I swear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product gave no visible volume, ruined the curl,definition, and length that I have naturally, and the fibers looked unnatural hanging off the tips of my lashes. I strongly recommend to stay with the regular Voluminous line or use something totally different. Anything but this.</li>
    <li> I bought this product about two weeks ago based on the commercial.  I have bought other L&#x27;Oreal makeup products in the past and have been very happy with them.  Here&#x27;s what I hated about this product.  1- from the moment I opened the tube, there was nothing but mascara glop that covered the entire wand.  2- in order for me to use this product, I have to wipe the wand on the sides of the tube to get the excess glop off.  For how heavily this was advertised, It has been nothing but a huge disappointment.</li>
    <li> I do like this mascara.  The name is appropriate, as I think it does make my lashes look fuller than my previously-used brand.</li>
    <li> I was a little bit unsure of this because of so many negative reviews, but I found it to be wonderful and it did just what it said it would. My eyelashes looked longer and fuller, and it&#x27;s not too runny and liquid like a lot of mascaras are, so it didn&#x27;t take lots of coats (and lots of time) to put it on. It&#x27;s my new favorite mascara!</li>
    <li> bought this to try a new mascara. it was clumpy right away and difficult to apply evenly. the only good thing about this mascara is that it is easy to take off. more expensive then other brands that are sooooo much better!</li>
    <li> I used this one several years back, and i remember falling in love with my eyes and being complimented about my eye makeup alot&lt;br /&gt;my sister &amp;#34;borrowed&amp;#34; it from me ..She has small eyes , really thing lashes ,, and She swears by it , she finished it and kept looking for a similar one , but we don&#x27;t have it everywhere here in our city.. so I decided to order 2 of it from amazon ..&lt;br /&gt;BEAUTY LOVERS ...GET IT , it has a false lash effect exactly as it says,, u might wanna practice using it perfectly , coz the formula is a bit thick &amp;#34;coz of the fibers in it&amp;#34; but once u get to know ur way around it, U WILL LOVE IT</li>
    <li> I love this mascara. The brush is actually pretty good, its smaller blisters at the tip and larger at the end provides that flare look. This is what a was looking for since I used to spend a lot of time applying coats and cots of mascara in order to make my lashes look thick, full and long. This is not the case anymore because it comes out a lot of product along with the brush, which could be a disadvantage for those who don&#x27;t know how to distribute the mascara properly. Lashes won&#x27;t look as if you are wearing false lashes but you definitely will obtain a dramatic look. I took out one star because its formula is a little heavy and the lashes tent to fell off but is not a problem if you curl your lashes a little more than usual.  Of course I would buy it again until loreal has a new mascara because they are the best out there. Not even the expensive ones at sehora are as good as loreal&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Very bad quality. Like a mud, simple black mud that cover eyelashes as big mess, i would say. No worth even for free to get.</li>
    <li> This stuff sucks. I bought it after reading reviews and trying to find a lash mascara similar and cheaper than Younique 3D fiber mascara. I like the shape of the brush that&#x27;s it. It flakes, for one, but more importantly it made my (already short) lashes look even shorter! Maybe this would be good for someone with already long, thick lashes but for me it is junk. The only reason I even gave it a star is because zero stars isn&#x27;t an option. If you&#x27;re looking for a lengthening drug store mascara, buy Neutrogena Healthy Lengths. This mascara went in my trash and I never throw away mascara.</li>
    <li> So far, im pretty pleased with this mascara. It lengthens and provides seperated, semi-full lashes. Better at the lengthening though.&lt;br /&gt;Be careful, will clump if there is too much product on the brush. I recommend using this with another mascara for best results.&lt;br /&gt;I think LOreal has some of the best drugstore mascaras out right now. Glad I tried this one. It&#x27;s not perfect and it sheds a little but definetly an improvement.</li>
    <li> I just bought this recently after trying the L&#x27;Oreal Million lashes and I am totally sold on the Voluminous False Lashes Mascara.  The volume and and length are incredible. The Million Lashes mascara is great but, this one creates false lash effect and I&#x27;ve had friends compliment me on my lashes (and of course I told them about this product).  I did not experience any of the negative things other reviewers wrote about.  I had no clumping, no flaking, no raccoon eyes. It wears well throughout the day and comes off very easily with non-oily eye makeup remover.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I was leery about getting this, I am quite attached to my Fallsies brand mascara and thought this was a phony and didn&#x27;t believe the commercials, but boy was I wrong! Lashes are amazing! I&#x27;ve only had it for about a week and so far so good, willing to stock up on this!  Try it, it will make your eyes look amazing!</li>
    <li> i love it! i tried covergirl and maybelline. l&#x27;oreal has by far the best mascara products when it comes to volume. i just started using it when it separates very well my lashes. i dont know how it will be in time but i am very happy now. 2 applications and people at work thought i had fake eye lashes. i will stick with l&#x27;oreal for now. i have been using l&#x27;oreal volume mascara for years and i will not change now.</li>
    <li> I gave this three stars only because once you can actually clean off the brush it IS a good mascara. HOWEVER when you take the brush out of the tube it brings so much mascara with it it&#x27;s ridiculous. I&#x27;ve given it a good shot but it&#x27;s just not worth the aggravation of trying to clean all the extra off the brush.</li>
    <li> I was looking for mascara that would really make my lashes look full and stand out.  This, definitely made them stand out, but it chips off, within a few hours and I would see flakes of mascara all over my upper cheeks. Then, I noticed that my eyes were always red and I thought it was seasonal allergies. It wasn&#x27;t, it was from this mascara. This is the first L&#x27;Oreal mascara that I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;ve never had any issues with Maybelline, but wanted to see if I could find something that worked better. This wasn&#x27;t it.</li>
    <li> I have tried lots of different mascara&#x27;s - this one is a proven performer. I always come back to it.  It&#x27;s consistent.  I have little lashes - thin - the opposite of my hair for some reason - anyway I digress - I&#x27;ve used this product for years and I&#x27;m always happy with the results.  Price is much better here than &amp;#34;out there&amp;#34; too.</li>
    <li> Shipped fast. Thank you! Loved it but it&#x27;s puts on the mascara real heavy.</li>
    <li> I have used L&#x27;Oreal Voluminous mascara for years and I truly believe it is one of the all time best mascaras on the market.  I usually use the Voluminous False Fiber lashes first, followed by the Voluminous Carbon Black mascara.  These two together create very long, dark, and dramatically full lashes.  The only complaint I have is that the Voluminous False Fiber mascara gets very caked up around the opening and this particular Voluminous product seems to get used up quicker than the others, such as the Carbon Black.  I would highly recommend this product if you like the look of super dark, full, long lashes!</li>
    <li> This is such a great mascara. It makes my lashes so long they touch my eyebrows! It&#x27;s not very volumizing, but that&#x27;s ok, I just put on some Maybelline Falsies mascara before I put this on and it looks like I&#x27;m wearing false lashes. :)</li>
    <li> Alas, my lashes have thinned over the years and I&#x27;ve tried almost all mascara brands and this makes my lashes the longest and thickest.  First apply an thin coat and follow with a second for the boldest look.  When I&#x27;m in a hurry one coat will even do. Combine with some liquid liner for cat eyes and follow with this mascara for big, bold eyes... and no sadly, I may not be anything near Kim Kardashian, but this gets me the closest to having the bold Kardashian eye-look.</li>
    <li> Okay, I have been using Latisse for about 6 months so I am satisfied with my natural length; but I do like a little \\&quot;extra.\\&quot;  I have been pleased with other L&#x27;Oreal mascaras (Telescopic is my fave!).  HOWEVER... this mascary is yucky! lol  It DID NOT lengthen my lashes whatsoever (Wet &#x27;N Wild mascara is better!).  It clumped something awful!  After one coat, my lashes just looked gross.  They actually looked shorter than their actual length with major clumps! A NO-NO FOR MASCARA! The brush did nothing to separate or define.  I was greatly disappointed with this formula and brush!  If I could give this ZERO stars, I most certainly would!  Yep... it&#x27;s that bad.</li>
    <li> Good and suitable product as my wife says thank you</li>
    <li> Creates good length but not much volume.</li>
    <li> I hate it! It&#x60;s terrible .. it makes the lashes sticks ones to others and your eyes is just a mess.. lots of mascara making balls on you lashes. Never ever recommend.</li>
    <li> This may be my new favorite mascara to date. It provides a great deal of volume and a decent illusion of length in just a few strokes without a great degree of clumping. What clumps it does produce are easily worked out. I have sensitive eyes and I can wear this stuff for hours and hours without having the urge to scrape my eyeballs out. Previously I was using NYC&#x27;s Showtime which I quite like still as well as Maybelline&#x27;s XXL Pro Curling Mascara, but so long as L&#x27;Oreal is making this stuff, I&#x27;ll continue buying it.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t appear to add any length via the fibers but coats nicely and offers decent coverage. Overall wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> The mascara formula is fine, but the brush is not my favorite. And as any girl knows, the brush is just as important as the mascara itself. I like a fine brush that separates my lashes so that each lash is appropriately coated. With this brush I usually get clusters of lashes instead of individual lashes.</li>
    <li> After a little unfortunate run-in with lash glue that was too ...glue-ie,&lt;br /&gt;I had some spaces I needed to fill in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff makes it like it never happened.  BEST MASCARA EVER.&lt;br /&gt;and I was a die-hard of my previous brand for over 10 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This CHANGED ME.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALSO: unlike other lash extending mascaras, it doesn&#x27;t leave little tube-particles on your cheeks!</li>
    <li> I have been using this mascara for almost a year now in its waterproof counterpart- which is fantastic- but wound up accidentally purchasing the normal formula once. Worse mascara I have ever used- no amount of lash curling could counteract the weight of this formula, which would turn perfectly perky and curled lashes into pin-straight fringe within seconds of coating lashes. Do yourself a favor and buy the wonderful waterproof formula and stay a mile away from this terrible product!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how some other reviewers did not have the experience that I have daily when using this mascara.  I am excited to give it five stars.  I am 45 years old, and this BY FAR the BEST mascara that I have EVER used.  I am a natural dark blonde, with short pale eyelashes on blue eyes.  Regular mascara certainly helps by darkening up my own lashes, but this stuff gives my eyelashes that WOW factor that no other mascara can.  I actually look forward to putting it on every day! It&#x27;s like a transformation! Somehow this miracle-in-a-bottle stuff turns my short blonde eyelashes into LONG black cat lashes across my eyes.  I will never again buy any other brand of mascara. Some people use two coats, I only use one because I don&#x27;t like my lashes to be thick or clumpy.  This mascara stays on ALL day until I use makeup remover at night.  It doesn&#x27;t flake.  It doesn&#x27;t smudge - not at all, which is also amazing to me.  It doesn&#x27;t burn, itch, or irritate me in any way.  All it does is create beautiful LONG lashes and now my eyes POP when they used to fade.  Buy this!</li>
    <li> I tried this mascara and was very disappointed.  It clumsp up for number 1 and it doesn&#x27;t give that false lash  appearance like that product states and show.  I will stick with Maybelline illegal length fiber extensions mascara.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara it never flakes or smears on my upper lid even after wearing it all day. It lengthens and thickens my natural lashes to look as if I have false eye lashes on. Great for every day wear.</li>
    <li> I do like this product better than any other fiber mascara. It can clump you need to apply thin and then reapply when it dries. Helps prevent clumping.  I curl my lashes first and brush them out.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara however it burns my eyes badly and turns them bright red. Obviously, i avoid getting it in my eyes but even the smallest amount on inner part of my eyelid (not on my eyeball) causes this irritation, which then makes my eyes water which causes more to get in my eye...&lt;br /&gt;This may not be a problem for everyone, though I have talked to a few others who have the same problem with this mascara.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, great mascara, love the brush!</li>
    <li> It was dried out and didn&#x27;t really do much. I was very disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> Dries up very quick, but it&#x27;s an alright product still</li>
    <li> Wife bought it, says she loves it</li>
    <li> It smeared pretty bad on my make up, and kept irritating my eyes. It didn&#x27;t lengthened lashes at all. I don&#x27;t have time to be looking in a compact every 5 seconds to adjust my make-up. Fist time, and last. It ruined the pics I had to have taken.</li>
    <li> I disagree with the name. I find that this mascara is more lengthening than volumizing, at least in my case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a dramatic look and not truly natural. I would wear this more for evenings than day time wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You really get the most out of your lashes with this mascara and it&#x27;s very dramatic.</li>
    <li> I like this product.  It works well and separates lashes as well as lengthening them.  I use two coats and it&#x27;s perfect.  However, it runs out very fast.</li>
    <li> The tube I received was completely dried out and clumpy on the brush. Looked awful when I tried to apply. Went straight into the trash.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product - I always get the waterproof, because I have watery eyes.  This makes your lashes look really full and long.</li>
    <li> Really plumps lashes quickly.  I like this brush much better than the new type</li>
    <li> My eyelashes are not long and about average on thickness, so I&#x27;m always on the look out for a mascara will make my eyelashes stand out and was curious when I saw this one at the store. Even though I was a bit skeptical, I found this mascara really does lengthens and thickens my eyelashes without using an eyelash curler but if I use the eyelash curler the look of my eyelashes are even more stand out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought Blackest Black which is very deep black and stands out. As I put it on, with each stroke I can see my lashes getting longer and thicker. The trick to keeping the mascara from clumping as you put it on, is turning the brush a quarter of a turn, after two or three strokes. Plus as you pull the wand out of the mascara container, gently wipe it across the opening. Wiping the wand across the edge of the mascara bottle&#x27;s opening also makes sure the mascara doesn&#x27;t clump in random sections on the mascara brush while evenly distributing it across the brush. The tip of the brush does a good job reaching the eyelashes on outer corner of the eyes and the hard to reach little eyelashes. The overall look isn&#x27;t clumpy but smooth looking which I am very happy with and my eyelashes still feel soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though my eyelids get oily as the day goes on, this mascara stays on all day without flaking around the eyes with very minimal smudging and is very easy to clean off. I wash my face with [[ASIN:B004DK79A2 Neutrogena Naturals Cleanser + Makeup Remover, Fresh Cleansing, 6 oz.]] and have no need to use an oily eye makeup remover to remove this mascara, I love that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;L&#x27;Oreal Voluminous False Lashes Mascara is my new little miracle in a bottle for my eyelashes. I was a dedicated [[ASIN:B000EGIM5A Lancome DEFINICILS High Definition Black Mascara (6.5g) .23 Ounce]] user until this gem. I highly recommend this mascara!</li>
    <li> I have used many, many kinds of mascara, both drug store brands as well as department store brands.  I bought this mascara because I thought it was the one they used on Project Runway, (which it&#x27;s not), and wanted to try it.  It isn&#x27;t any different than all of the other cheapy mascaras out there, &amp; it does not do what it advertises.  Of ALL of the mascaras that I have tried in my life, (which is about 20 years now, &amp; I am a makeup \\&quot;junky\\&quot;), the best mascaras that I have used &amp; always stick to or go back to are: Loreal Lash Out Mascara (regular original formula), CoverGirl Remarkable Washable Waterproof Mascara, and Avon Mark Scanda-Lash Mascara (all of which I always purchase in Black/Brown).  Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> It definitely makes my eyelashes look better than any other mascara I&#x27;ve ever used. It can be kind of clumpy and it is extremely difficult to get off- I think I lost about 6 lashes in the process of trying to wash it off, but those inconveniences are comparable to the ones I dealt with when I wore fake eyelashes, and those were way more expensive. I would say it is a good alternative to fake lashes. I still wear fakes at night or when I want a more dramatic look, but this is great for during the day. It makes my blonde lashes look longer, fuller, and much darker. If you get it though, definitely invest in an eyelash brush to de-clump immediately after application, and a good eye-makeup remover.</li>
    <li> This is one of the worse mascaras I&#x27;ve ever bought. It&#x27;s runny. Within one hour of wearing it I had racoon eyes. It&#x27;s supposed to come off with soap and water but it took two days to get this off completely.</li>
    <li> L&#x27;Oreal mascaras are in my opinion, some of the best that you can find at the drugstore. At first, the False Fiber Lashes was no exception.  The wand is average-sized, it&#x27;s almost triangular in shape. The best feature of this mascara, however, is the brush itself. It&#x27;s very dense and packed with bristles which help it to coat every individual lash.  The formula is okay. The first week I used it, it was clump-free, thickening, volumizing, and very black. It literally looked like I was wearing false lashes. I&#x27;m currently on my third week of using this mascara and unfortunately the formula has dried out quite a bit. As others have said in their reviews before me, the brush is so dense and  takes so much of the mascara itself that it dries out easily. It still thickens and volumizes, but I&#x27;m starting to get large clumps when I apply it.  Overall, I really like this mascara. But it&#x27;s only good for about 2 weeks, and then move on to something else!</li>
    <li> DISSLIKE !!! Horrible, DO NOTT RECOMMEND THIS ITEM.. ITS VERY DIFFERENT THEN THE PICTURE SHOW US. I DIDN&#x27;T BELIEVE THAT THIS IS REALLY LOREAL.</li>
    <li> This mascara rivals any department store mascara at a fraction of the cost.  Lengthens lashes and washes off easily, priced competitively.</li>
    <li> It does what it says.  Long long lashes. Not clumpy, The lashes look natually long. The wand is wonderful (though a bit longer than I am used to so I poked myself in the eye lol), but it seems that there isn&#x27;t much product in the container.  Overall, it;s a great purchase. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried pretty much any brand of mascara you can think of....All of the expensive ones and this one is better than anything I&#x27;ve tried!!</li>
    <li> My lashes are thin, light blonde (almost invisible unless you&#x27;re really up close), and medium length.  This mascara completely changes that though.  I actually grabbed the color \\&quot;black\\&quot; by mistake (I usually get the \\&quot;blackest black\\&quot; in whatever brand I choose) but I didn&#x27;t notice any difference color-wise; it was still satisfyingly dark.  If you apply one coat, you get a nice, almost every-day type of look.  But this mascara is buildable and if you want a darker, more dramatic look, then this can be achieved as quickly as applying the second layer.  There is absolutely no clumping!  This mascara also multiplies my lashes and creates a really voluminous look (what can I say, the name was well chosen ^_^).  I think the false fibers helped with that; they help fill in the gaps so your lash line is completely full.  Another thing that is really impressive to me is that this mascara holds your curl ALL DAY!  I&#x27;m talking from 8 in the morning until 11:30 at night.  I also like the tube; the cap makes a \\&quot;click\\&quot; noise when it&#x27;s screwed on completely, which ensures it&#x27;s on tight and you know there&#x27;s no air getting to it.  I didn&#x27;t have the problems others mentioned.  Regarding wetness, I would recommend the waterproof version (which is what I have) because I can assure you it does not feel wet and heavy on your lashes nor does it cause them to stick together.  Very rarely I notice a microscopic amoung of flaking under the eyes, but it&#x27;s so minimal that I only notice up close and it&#x27;s easy to wipe away; I do not notice the false fibers falling out, and they don&#x27;t irritate my eyes either like anohter false fiber mascara did.  It&#x27;s fairly easy to take off at night with makeup remover, but depending on how many layers you apply, it could get tough to make sure the product is completely removed from your eyelashes, so that&#x27;s my only negative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this mascara makes your lashes dark, voluminous, multiplied, and holds your curl all day.  No flaking, no clumping, andit&#x27;s affordable.  Definitely one I&#x27;d reccommend.</li>
    <li> Ok, this wasn&#x27;t false lash worthy by far. It was ok but it didn&#x27;t even do the over dramatic cheap trashy creepy crawler eyes which none of us want but it seemed almost dry. The consistency was dry and almost sticky with less gooey and more of a stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wand isn&#x27;t very good either because you can easily get the mascara on your eyes if not careful. It&#x27;s is now with one other mascara in my in case of emergency (the emergency being I lost my other makeup) box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t expect Christian Dior Show, but I wanted this big gold bottle with false last effect to be a little better than this.</li>
    <li> I agree with the previous rating, this mascara does go quickly since the brush takes so much out. None the less, i love it. I have some long lashes to begin with and this stuff is thick and looks awesome. better than the thin water stuff, it helps if u have a eyelash brush to avoid chunks immiediatly following the application to get rid of any thick spots.</li>
    <li> I was an avid user of L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Voluminous mascara. Decided to see what else is out there. Tried this first. Thought it was terrible. Whatever benefits it had were dashed by dry, flaking, clumping, messiness. Replaced it with KORRES volcanic mineral mascara. Much more expensive, much better product.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t even look like the correct brand. The totally wrong mascara, not really Loreal and not the correct mascara.  There is no label and the brush is completely wrong.</li>
    <li> Or its old or its not the original one..it does not give me the same effect than the on I bought in the duty free store at the airport..dont recommend it</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I was hesitant on buying but, so glad I did. It makes your lashes huge and separates them great.</li>
    <li> I love to try new make up products specially mascaras. This is a pretty good overall mascara&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;1. The formula does not clump&lt;br /&gt;2. The formula is dry and fibrous so doesn&#x27;t get on your eyelids&lt;br /&gt;3. Long lasting&lt;br /&gt;4. Great lengthening and separating mascara&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;1. Doesn&#x27;t give curl to the lashes&lt;br /&gt;2. Want might feel heavy&lt;br /&gt;3. I felt that it didn&#x27;t give much volume&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to let me know any questions or comments!</li>
    <li> Ive bought lots of designer brands from Macys/Von Maur and they dont match this stuff. Skip the expensive stuff and go with this!</li>
    <li> I used to love this mascara, but it isn&#x27;t doing it for me anymore. I switched to another mascara. This brand when I bought from the drugstore was much better quality than the ones I&#x27;d get from Amazon. It was like they were old and had been sitting.</li>
    <li> I first bought this mascara at a drugstore in Miami, and after running through several expensive mascaras I´m returning to this one, Super Long, voluminous and curled lashes and very easy to clean!</li>
    <li> I prefer L&#x27;Oreal telescopic mascara that one is the best...!</li>
    <li> I have bought this lash. Unfortunately I cannot use this one because when I got product lash was dried. Pls do not buy this is waste of money. I</li>
    <li> I bit dry so i know it wont last long</li>
    <li> I enjoy this mascara because it does lengthen, however, it is clumpy.  The mascara dries out quickly so I got about a couple weeks of good use out of it before the clumping got much worse.  It also is much harder to wash off, so I have to make sure to wash my eyes 3 or 4 times to get it all off to avoid raccoon eyes.  I got the mascara for a great deal but wouldn&#x27;t purchase it for full price.</li>
    <li> if i could give this 10 stars i would ! attaches fibres to your original lashes so your lashes  double  and LOOK PHENOMENAL !</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this because i use another brush-on fake eyelash product and really love how it stays put (even when swimming) but washes off effortlessly with warm water. I tried L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s version because it came in brown, which my standard (FiberWig) doesn&#x27;t. I got TONS of compliments with L&#x27;Oreal, but my eyes burned most of the morning, and by afternoon, it left brown circles under my eyes. Going back to [[ASIN:B00FAR3LP4 B00FAR3LP4]]</li>
    <li> Good for giving longer lashes as a result of the false fibers, but it clumps. This is my second, but on account of the clumping, I don&#x27;t think I will re-ourchase.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It always makes my lashes look full and defined.  They add great length too.  Now if only they can create a mascara that will never run out.</li>
    <li> Although I love L&#x27;Oreal products, this was not the best mascara I&#x27;ve tried. I found that it feathered way too much. I always felt like I had something in my eye, and more often than not I&#x27;d find little black fibres in my eye. Also I found that by the end of the day, I&#x27;d have numerous fibres under my eyes and on my cheeks. It looks awesome when you first put it on, but then as time goes by, it becomes very dry and the fibres start falling off your lashes. I would hate to imagine what those fibres in the eye would do to contact lens wearers. I don&#x27;t recommend this product. There are better products out there, like the original Voluminous Mascara by L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
    <li> Long time user, Havent let me down</li>
    <li> Love this mascara. By far my favorite since L&#x27;Oreal discontinued the lash architect. I won&#x27;t use anything else! Makes my lashes longer and thicker.</li>
    <li> This is the most terrible quality!  The brush is horrible and I have never had such clumpy tarantula looking eye lashes before until I used this.  I am sorry that I tried something new, will definitely go back to my old brand.</li>
    <li> Trying find something that&#x27;ll make my eyes pop using little make up. This wasn&#x27;t it.  It&#x27;s not cause it doesn&#x27;t do that job it&#x27;s cause it&#x27;s sooo messy and clumpy to use!&lt;br /&gt;If you wipe it to try to unclump it it smears everywhere then it&#x27;s just hell to make it look good.</li>
    <li> I use high end mascara. Then I heard you don&#x27;t need to use high end mascara because of all cosmetics, mascara, is mascara. So wrong! This mascara stinks! By that I mean it is extremely hard to take off at night, using either olive oil, vaseline, makeup remover. It doesn&#x27;t come off. In the morning my lashes are glued together looking downright awful. I am running, running fast, back to my high end mascara. One coat of my expensive mascara does the job of 5 coats of this cheap crap. And, it is drying out already and I have only had it for 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara. I have tried high end and low end stuff, and this is by far one of my favorites. L&#x27;Oréal makes high quality makeup.</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE BEST MASCARA EVER!  I have never found anything like this from a drugstore.  I was a long time fan of Lancome&#x27;s Definicils mascara, which is great for lengthening and volumizing.  However, one tube is nearly 30 bucks which is quite expensive for a product that seems to have so many competitors out there claiming to do the same thing but for less.  So on a whim, I tried this product.  I have average lashes, but love a more dramatic look. This product volumizes, lengthens DRAMATICALLY, and darkens.  It delivers everything it promises, and more. Yes, a lot of product may end up on the wand, but that is easily avoided if you drag the wand to the side(s) when it&#x27;s almost completely pulled out of the tube.  Also, a little trick to avoiding the clumpy effect is to \\&quot;roll\\&quot; the wand up, or turn the wand up as you coat the lashes, as opposed to just painting them upwards in one fell swoop.  I love the design of the brush, which is encased by a beautiful gold tone exterior that looks and feels classy.  This is a hit for me, and I will never try anything else.  Great if you want a nice dramatic eyelashes, without the tarantula look.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and great product!</li>
    <li> This is the most perfect mascara, it really makes my lashes look perfect and voluminous, I recommended 100 % for everyone</li>
    <li> I have long lashes, and this product clumped them up. If you like thick, clumpy eyelashes then you&#x27;ll like this. I prefer cleaner lashes.</li>
    <li> I am getting older and my eyelashes have dwindled in thickness and length, so I am looking for a mascara that helps me with this issue.</li>
    <li> I bought this at a drug store, not Amazon. I was looking for a fiber mascara and I figured this would do the trick. Unfortunately, it flaked off all day and I constantly has to grab a mirror to get pieces of mascara out of my eye. I ended up with a headache and I removed it as soon as I got home.&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years now. Makes my lashes so full and thick I get compliments on them, and also get asked if I&#x27;m wearing false lashes. This mascara is affordable and I makes my eyes pop. Just be careful if you sleep with your makeup on, the little fibers get everywhere and can irritate your eyes.</li>
    <li> works better than the rest.tried them all</li>
    <li> Love it because i can&#x27;t put on my own fake lashes,lol.This is so much more convenient and faster for me.&lt;br /&gt;I really does make your lashes fuller and longer. I used it over my mascara and used 2 coats anything more than that and it will clump.&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant to purchase yonique because it cost $30.00 and prefer to buy the least expensive when it comes to so many products like this on the market. I bought L&#x27;oreal voluminous fiber lashes for $7.94 at Walmart. I love it and i will try others as well but so far i am using this one.&lt;br /&gt;Try it it doesn&#x27;t cost much and at least you didn&#x27;t spend more than $10 bucks.</li>
    <li> I have naturally very long and dark eyelashes to where I don&#x27;t really &amp;#34;need&amp;#34; mascara, but this helps thicken them up a bit and gives them lift - I don&#x27;t need to use an eyelash curler. With even a minimal coat of this, it looks like I have false lashes but not gawdy or anything. LOVE THIS! Be sure the scrape the excess on the sides of the tube before use.</li>
    <li> Not good for contact wearers due to flakes. The photo shows loreal false fiber lashes (black) on the left and almay one coat lengthening mascara (brown) on the right. Loreal is more volumizing but had no staying power. The photo was taken less than an hr after application and I had already wiped off smudging once :(</li>
</ol>
