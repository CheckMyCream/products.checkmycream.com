    <li> Liked it a lot. Used it on my nipple piercings and now my industrial. They are healing quickly! However, it&#x27;s also at times inconvenient because the spray gets everywhere and runs down your body and makes a mess. It sprays a wide radius. Customer service was OUTSTANDING. I received a spray can in the package that didn&#x27;t spray and they helped me and were so friendly. They quickly shipped a new one.</li>
