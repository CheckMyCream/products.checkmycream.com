      <li>Great and does the job.</li>
      <li>Great price.</li>
      <li>Theses foot files are great.  </li>
      <li>great product, have bought as gifts as well as for myself.  </li>
      <li>I am so happy with the results that I plan to stick with the product.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Cheap is good sometimes.</li>
      <li>price is good too</li>
      <li>(  Found a cheap Beechwood file that works great.</li>
      <li>I can honestly say that I often can’t tell which one I’ve been using.</li>
      <li>, then I use these finer grit ones to finish off and that works ok.</li>
      <li>They have more grit than the ones I have bought at the store and are</li>
      <li>so glad I did.  </li>
      <li>and I use that one for the primary upkeep now</li>
      <li>Makes it smooth</li>
      <li>so I had high hopes for getting so many (one in each room!)</li>
      <li>and they return to their original state.  </li>
      <li>I sleep with gel socks and a rich ointment.  </li>
      <li>Works great gets all that dry skin  </li>
      <li>and my heels are soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>the plastic handle is cheaply made and if an adult were to put any pressure</li>
      <li>Does a nice job buffing away rough skin on your feet.  </li>
      <li>The BelleSha sander is a simple and effective product that after a week I have the feet of a young woman again.  </li>
      <li>The plastic is sturdy enough but the sand paper is too fine.  </li>
      <li>They get the job done, but very flimsy.</li>
      <li>I finally bought these since they were cheap, and I stuck one in the shower.</li>
      <li>Plastic is really bendable.</li>
      <li>I really like these.  </li>
      <li>delievery was fast .</li>
      <li>Much better than other products I have tried.</li>
      <li>The flexibility of the plastic does make them feel pretty flimsy, but that wasn&#x27;t my main gripe: these are the FIRST EVER foot buffers where using them actually made my feet ROUGHER.</li>
      <li>this is my second order, lasts a long time and feet are very smooth</li>
      <li>I find if I touch up with the fine side every few days</li>
      <li>But I lift weights a lot, so my hands get torn up and calluses build up, and the side of my big toe gets the large calluse.</li>
      <li>However, they are very durable and it will take a long time to go through all 5.</li>
      <li>The dead skin can build up quickly and reduce the effect of the sander.  </li>
      <li>:o</li>
      <li>I was planning to order one of the new electric or battery powered foot sanders you see advertised today however the reviews were so mixed that I held off and ordered BelleSha Double Sided Foot Filers instead</li>
      <li>They quickly sand down rough skin.  </li>
      <li>So far, they&#x27;ve worked great for me, keeping my hands from looking like an ogre, and actually makes it less painful to lift with calluse build</li>

    <li> Works great gets all that dry skin  Makes it smooth I like to use it dry!</li>
    <li> Theses foot files are great.  They have more grit than the ones I have bought at the store and are wider, really gets to work on the heavy areas.</li>
    <li> Plastic is really bendable. Grit is not great.</li>
    <li> Product: flimsy, won&#x27;t buy again.  Seller: delievery was fast .</li>
    <li> These were disappointing. I&#x27;m a foot-buffing addict so I had high hopes for getting so many (one in each room!) for such a low cost. The flexibility of the plastic does make them feel pretty flimsy, but that wasn&#x27;t my main gripe: these are the FIRST EVER foot buffers where using them actually made my feet ROUGHER. I had no idea that was possible! They must just have exactly the wrong grits of sandpaper for my skin. I bought a sturdier one with two coarser grits at my local Sally&#x27;s Beauty and I use that one for the primary upkeep now, then I use these finer grit ones to finish off and that works ok.</li>
    <li> They get the job done, but very flimsy.</li>
    <li> Great quality for this price! Gets the job done. Plus you get five.</li>
    <li> Not as course as I expected. Makes you work kinda hard.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t be buying these again.  They are not effective.  The plastic is sturdy enough but the sand paper is too fine.  Ineffective, therefore a waste of money.  :o(  Found a cheap Beechwood file that works great.</li>
    <li> Great and does the job. Will leave a black sand like residue after the first few uses but that go away.</li>
    <li> this is my second order, lasts a long time and feet are very smooth</li>
    <li> Excellent product and seller I recommend both!</li>
    <li> if these were not for kids they would break...the plastic handle is cheaply made and if an adult were to put any pressure it would crack a child has curved it and they have little hands feet and nothing to file off....</li>
    <li> I have a couch that gives me black elbows--not with these around.</li>
    <li> I was planning to order one of the new electric or battery powered foot sanders you see advertised today however the reviews were so mixed that I held off and ordered BelleSha Double Sided Foot Filers instead and I’m so glad I did.  I have been struggling with dry heels, and patches on my feet for several years now.  I’ve tried every cream, oil out there, microplane foot stander, pumice stones, gel socks etc etc.  Never happy with the results.  At night the rough skin on my feet would catch on the sheets and drive me crazy.  The BelleSha sander is a simple and effective product that after a week I have the feet of a young woman again.  I use the medium side if it’s been a while and then move to the finer side and my heels are soft and smooth.  Even some of the deeper cracks are working their way out.  I find if I touch up with the fine side every few days it maintains my results and a few nights a week I sleep with gel socks and a rich ointment.  I am so happy with the results that I plan to stick with the product.  Definitely want to rinse the sanders off after use and they return to their original state.  The dead skin can build up quickly and reduce the effect of the sander.  I’ve used them for a few weeks now and they are holding up well.  I can honestly say that I often can’t tell which one I’ve been using.</li>
    <li> very poor quality, threw it directly into the trash</li>
    <li> great product, have bought as gifts as well as for myself.  price is good too</li>
    <li> Does a nice job buffing away rough skin on your feet.  Great price.</li>
    <li> Worked beautifully. Much better than other products I have tried.</li>
    <li> Great value for money! And gets the job done!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy, so I&#x27;m not real picky on these kinds of things. But I lift weights a lot, so my hands get torn up and calluses build up, and the side of my big toe gets the large calluse.

    <li> I really like these.  They quickly sand down rough skin.  However, they are very durable and it will take a long time to go through all 5.</li>
