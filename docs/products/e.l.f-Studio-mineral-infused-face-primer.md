<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Horrible yeo . Why is it so shimmery</li>
    <li> When I ordered this product the photo showed a CLEAR primer which is what I though I was buying. What I got was this tan sparkling fairy poop.  However the product does have a great consistency and goes on smooth.</li>
    <li> I had used the clear version of this for a while and really liked it, and I had heard that this one was similar to a Smashbox primerr, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. It was SPARKLY, as other reviewers have noted. Which is ok if you don&#x27;t use too much and use foundation over it, which I do. However, I do sometimes get a bit of sparkle even after doing the rest of my makeup, which I dislike.It doesn&#x27;t seem to provide quite as good of a base as the clear does.</li>
    <li> My husband purchased this primer for me and I was really happy with the application it goes onto my skin smooth and it minimizes my pores and gives my foundation a beautiful glow. It makes my makeup last all day without oil or shine. I recommend this primer I love it.</li>
    <li> Extremely disappointed by the actual amount of product in the container. The manufacturer purposely packages this to deceive their customers. It&#x27;s too bad because it&#x27;s a great product and they make it look like you are getting a reasonable amount for the money. But in actuality, you are receiving about a thimble full .... not worth the money.</li>
    <li> Due to the awful description mixed with the primers have similar names, I am completely dissatisfied. I love the clear primer and don&#x27;t go a day without it but this stuff makes me sparkle like a Cullen in the sun. Its awful.</li>
    <li> Company accidentally sent the wrong product. Though I was disappointed, I couldn&#x27;t contact the seller due to several issues with my computer. But when I was able to access amazon and my email again I was able to see that the company saw their mistake and refunded me all charge+shipping, which was AMAZING. They also let me keep the face moisturizer they sent by accident. Moisturizer is also by e.l.f and it definitely kept my face better moisturized then my usual moisturizer. I recommend the moisturizer to someone with dry skin, also I would like to say e.l.f has great costumer service and that Ill be buying more of their products in the future.</li>
    <li> Thats so great!!! Love it!</li>
    <li> I did not know it was going to have a gold shimmer to it but still like it</li>
    <li> I was looking for a new face primer and found that a lot of people suggested e.l.f. I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. So far, I like it. It has sparkles in it, which still show through after foundation is applied, thus the radiance. But, with oilier skin, it does feel a little more oily than other primers I&#x27;ve used. I prefer one that &amp;#34;mattifies&amp;#34; and I wouldn&#x27;t say this does that... but then again, it&#x27;s supposed to give you a radiant glow, so not really it&#x27;s intended purpose.</li>
    <li> i do not like this product has a lot of glitter to it and makes my skin feel weird it is just sitting on my bathroom counter waiste of money</li>
    <li> the texture is what i wanted, a dupe of the Smashbox primer, but this shows a white picture, and the actual primer is squinting with shimmer. not exactly what i wanted but OK nonetheless.</li>
    <li> great product!! Love it!</li>
    <li> its a good primer,, its not at all oily,, the bottle is pretty too.. it does its job really well,, happy with the elf products and my purchase.. thank you :)</li>
    <li> Beautiful under glow of gold.. Love this product. !</li>
    <li> I love the e.l.f. Studio Mineral Infused Face Primer - (plain) so I thought I would try this one.  The item arrived quicker than expected - 5 stars on delivery!  But after using the product once I couldn&#x27;t get anything to come out of it.  Something on the inside stopped working correctly and I can&#x27;t figure it out.  After attempting to try to shake out the product I finally took the container apart, at least as much as you can.  That allowed me to force the plunger on the bottom up and get product out but it is such a small amount that I&#x27;m not sure if it was full or not.  It doesn&#x27;t take very much of this product as it goes a long way. But I have to say I was very disappointed with this product.  I probably won&#x27;t purchase this again.  I think I will just stick to the clear e.l.f. Sutdio Mineral Infused Face Priner and hope that the next bottle will work better.  :/</li>
    <li> Hard to say how I feel only used once! But wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of it cause its got a glittery look to it! So as long as you don&#x27;t mind that seemed fine! And was littler  than I thought it would be!</li>
    <li> Arrived in great time. Applied to face before foundation and I looked like a vampire out of twilight. Nothing but sparkle. Not my cup of tea.</li>
    <li> I bought the clear Elf Foundation Primer last time. It was great, especially for the value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try this one this time around and really don&#x27;t notice a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this primer, 2 foundations, a blush, and a powder on top.  I don&#x27;t know if that makes a huge difference but I don&#x27;t look &amp;#34;radiant&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;glowing&amp;#34;, really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having a glow wasn&#x27;t super important to me so I don&#x27;t have a problem continuing to use this one. For the price, it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
    <li> OMG! This primer is amazing! I order it for my wedding make up! I have to say I loooovvvveee the glitter effect in my face! and also your skin looks so nice and young! I will never again run out of this product.</li>
    <li> It has sparkles in it.  Why they put glitter in a primer, I&#x27;ll never know.</li>
    <li> I love this primer . It makes your make stay and it goes really smooth on the skin . Defenetly ordering again.</li>
    <li> This primer is do very ridiculous. Mineral infused face primer , radiant glow.let me tell you, when it says radiant glow it means RADIANT GLOW. There is so much gold shimmer in this primer!!!!!!! It&#x27;s like glitter lotion..or like those Jergens bronzing lotions? Yeah that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s like. Even after applying foundation and concealer, setting power contouring,you know my whole face makeup routine the shimmer shines through. I Tried a few times even with the smallest amounts, it was much too sparkly for me. The primer itself is very smooth and satiny but the color is terrible maybe a clear primer would be better.</li>
    <li> I thought I was getting a clear primer and instead it was a golden finish on my skin.  I didn&#x27;t like this infused color I did like the product it went on smoothly and seemed to do what it needed to when I applied my foundation.  I&#x27;ll try the clear primer next time.</li>
    <li> I love my e.l.f. Face primer....I have bought so many of them and shared with my friends. It is a must have for my makeup bag. I would distribute this product..call me e.l.f</li>
    <li> This primer is said to be a dupe for Smashbox&#x27;s primer (which retails at about $26). It is a silicone-based primer that fills in all the fine lines on your face leaving your skin feeling ultra-silky smooth and ready for a flawless application of foundation. I do notice that when I wear this under my foundation, my skin really looks flawless. I also use just 1 pump/drop for my whole face. While the product may feel a bit greasy during the first few second, it very quickly absorbs into the skin. The only down side is that the pump did break on me after several uses, but mine was part of the first batch that ELF put on the market and they have improved the pump since (according to their website). This did not break me out in any way. I think this is totally worth it for $6 on the ELF website!</li>
    <li> They should make clear in the product description that the primer is quite sparkly - like you&#x27;ve shaken glitter non your face!</li>
    <li> Great price, good size..money well spent, color is as described and stays on and cleans off easily. No worries of stains or anything like that.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s much smaller than I thought. The content is way less than you expect looking at the bottle. But you only need a tiny amount. It has a glittery shimmer look, I don&#x27;t mind it. First time using a primer. It&#x27;s ok so far.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great primer for mineral makeup. It has a bit of glimmer but it&#x27;s great for deflecting away from possibly imperfections of the skin or unevenness, especially if your older. No complaints.</li>
    <li> Leaves a clean sating finish , i love it . Goes under my makeup everytime . Will be purchasing more of this stuff in the future maybe.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realise there were different types of ELF primer, as the picture shows a clear serum. Radiant glow is a nude colour with sparkles. I&#x27;m not very happy with the shimmer as it means I can only use it for clubbing and not for every day makeup. Unfortunately I&#x27;m disappointed with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Goes on real smooth and blends nicely. Leaves a subtle glow and I wear this on the days I don&#x27;t put all my makeup on!</li>
    <li> If  you want a very sparkly face primer than this is for you!</li>
    <li> This stuff is really nice. I was kind of hesitant when I had reciveid it because the color is like a shimmering yellowish color but honestly when you put it on OMG! It&#x27;s flawless it works well with my MAC make-up. I&#x27;m a light skin black girl with reddish undertones. In winter I get really pale and in summer I get a nice warm summer glow. But for right now in these souther ca summer months I love this stuff. You can go from day to night it will last you all day. 2 thumbs up</li>
    <li> This left my face looking like a vampire caught in the sunshine. I was sparkling. I&#x27;m 31 years old. It, was awful.</li>
    <li> The texture is pretty silky and it goes on really easily, but I was NOT expecting how sparkly it was! After putting on liquid foundation, it&#x27;s less noticeable, but still VERY unexpected. My bottle&#x27;s pump came broken and either wouldn&#x27;t pump anything out or would shoot it all the way down my finger, so be careful of that. Some wiggling around and twisting and so far, it seems to be able to pop back into place before I use it. Definitely use some sort of powder with this because after liquid foundation alone, my face felt really slick and oily for the rest of the day.</li>
    <li> This is a &amp;#34;add on&amp;#34; item so I get three or more each time I purchase something from Amazon.  Smooth finish to apply mineral or liquid makeup.  Feels so good, I wear it everyday whether or not applying makeup.  Quality product at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> My eyes are very sensitive and I would not recommend this to anyone with sensitive eyes. Burns around my eyes other than that it&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize it was colored. I don&#x27;t think that was very clear on the pge or it didn&#x27;t stand out in all the info. It should have been in the pic for sure. I was looking for clear. As I don&#x27;t normally wear foundation. I will give it a chance as it is near my skin tone or I&#x27;ll have to blend it with another. It smells fine and seems smooth when I sampled on my finger.  Product info just needs to be clearer though! Will watch for that nxt time. I did see a clear on here just was out.</li>
    <li> Definitely minimizes pores, and foundation goes on evenly.&lt;br /&gt;Love the softness of the product. Suggest you buy in quantities.&lt;br /&gt;If used daily last about a week,plus.</li>
    <li> This primer was very inexpensive, so I tried it out. It arrived quickly, however, it is tinted and shimmers. It does make my skin feel silky, but I wanted a primer, not a liquid foundation.</li>
    <li> i love this!! its exactly what i was looking for! it shimmers shimmers and shimmerssssss!! will definitely go for it again.</li>
    <li> E.L.F. products are amazing for the price.  The packaging is a little cheap, but the product is solid.  Will certainly buy again!</li>
    <li> Bought for a gift...great!</li>
    <li> Im Excited To Use This Product.</li>
    <li> I like wearing a primer but this one gives your skin a weird golden glow. You have to put on a lot of makeup to coverup the shine which is something my skin has a problem with anyway. (Hence I wanna wear primer!)</li>
    <li> Like this.  Helps keep everything fresh and gives you a nice glow. It also has quite a pleasant scent. I&#x27;ve never used a product like this before but I like it</li>
    <li> I use this primer daily andvitbis perfect. The price is lower than the primer I used to use, but the results are the same.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff.  It goes on smooth and leaves your face silky.  I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars only because I wish there the bottle was a little bit bigger. It doesn&#x27;t last long. But I will continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> This doesnt look like the picture. The actual product is tinted and contains tons of glitter. I mix it with a little bit of non-scented clinique face lotion to turn down the intensity and it works well</li>
    <li> Not too shimmery which is good. Wouldn want too look too shimmering at work</li>
    <li> Too shimmy,but the price is cheap, did not request return.</li>
    <li> Works well but breaks my skin out</li>
    <li> The first time I put this on I panicked because it makes your whole face sort of glittery...but once your makeup is on, it&#x27;s not noticeable.  It does help foundation stay put and gives you a nice surface for applying makeup.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I really like it, but would NOT recommend it for use by itself. Way too shimmery for that.</li>
    <li> Fairly sparkly, wasn&#x27;t expecting it. Also kinda orangy/yellowy.. Once you finish your makeup it doesn&#x27;t look bad, If you use it sparingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I would have been more happy if i had purchased the non tinted one.</li>
    <li> After reading the comments I still purchased the product being optimistic... Ya I was wrong! After 4-5 hrs of wearing the product under my foundation it leaves your face blotchy with a weird tinge  of beige. The reviews of the product containing soo much glitter that your blingin like Edward Cullen on Twilight rings true! Although when the makeup is applied the glitter does disappear, anger 4-5 hrs your skin tone changes! Don&#x27;t waist your time! I wear expensive MAC makeup foundation that is advertised to last 5 hrs, but with this primer it makes your skin look pale and dull... Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
    <li> this product was definitely above my expectations! it made my skin feel softer and definitely makes my make up last longer</li>
    <li> I just received this the other day and there was no product in it just a plastic inside no primer.</li>
    <li> is this stuff suppose to feel greasy?  not sure I like it at all,  I don&#x27;t see any difference in my makeup....and I was so hopeful....oh well  on with the search</li>
    <li> I have used this product before this purchase for about a year.&lt;br /&gt;I made a mistake and ordered this with a tint of Mineral in it.  I do not recommend.  I felt like I was going clubbing after I applied it.  My face was so shimmery.&lt;br /&gt;It feels so silky smooth when you apply it.  It holds your make up for the day very well.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this in CLEAR.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think I was going to like this.  After trying it the first time, I stashed it away.  Then I ran out of my other primer and used it in a pinch.  It is a nice primer.  The only thing is that I was expecting a &amp;#34;sheen&amp;#34; and this actually has sparkles in it.  It is especially nice for evenings.</li>
    <li> Leaves my face so so so smooth..first time using elf products n I&#x27;m a happy girl..got here on time worth the price</li>
    <li> Skin feels like silk after application. Works great.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! You cannot get a better primer for such a low cost. I really enjoy all the elf products and this one doesn&#x27;t disappoint. The Radiant Glow color leaves a shimmer/sparkle to your skin which I like.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best primers I&#x27;ve used. The price is great. It feels like silk going on. One day I just wore this and my face looked luminous. Love this product</li>
    <li> Supposed to reduce or see improvement in fine lines and wrinkles but it actually accentuates them  more.</li>
    <li> Not what I assumed it was going to be false advertisement on the picture.I look like Edward Cullen after I put it on.</li>
    <li> Not a fan of this primer because it has too much &amp;#34;shimmer&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Holy Cow!  I&#x27;ve never used primer in my life.  But saw the good reviews.  Feels a bit greasy, however, I just blow dry my face after while i&#x27;m doing my hair.  And I use a Rice Bran foundation that that looks great after it (Palladio)</li>
    <li> it didn&#x27;t come clear like the pic shows. It came in a nude color with glitter in it</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t mistake this for the clear colorless Elf primer which is shown in the picture.  What you get is a tinted primer.  Both are good products and if I had actually received the clear, as pictured here, I would give it five stars.</li>
    <li> Nice primer, but only a tiny amount of product in the large dispenser.</li>
    <li> It gets the job done, it glittery but apply foundation over it, it&#x27;s not a problem.</li>
    <li> It works great but it sparkles and after along day it shows through your makeup</li>
    <li> Let me preface by saying:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A while ago, I ordered the Studio Mineral Face Primer in Clear as an experiment. The product was so silky and amazing (yes, amazing) that I immediately got upset with myself for the years of undying loyalty to Urban Decay&#x27;s $30 Pore perfecting Primer. It works better, my makeup went on so smooth, I got thousands of compliments (seriously I was basking in them!), and even I thought I looked fantastic, which is a rare occurrence indeed! the bottle it came in was faulty but even that didn&#x27;t sway my enthusiasm! I dug the primer out with a q-tip!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I was so in love with this primer that I had to order another bottle but this was the only one they had. I really wanted the clear again but I thought, &amp;#34;Hey me, you got to this good face goo by being adventurous, go ahead and try out this &#x27;Radient Glow&#x27;, whatever that is&amp;#34;... So I ordered it... it is sparkly!!! OMG is it sparkly!!! it sparkles so much, teenagers think I&#x27;m a vampire! ... So No more of that. But the Clear is SO AWESOME!!!</li>
