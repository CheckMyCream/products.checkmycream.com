      <li>Would have liked to had it shipped at no charge, but it was worth it.</li>
      <li>This is my wife&#x27;s favorite hair spray and the price is right.</li>
      <li>I have used Kenra Volume Super Hold Finishing Spray for a number of years</li>
      <li>My hair is medium length, straight, fine, but not thin.  </li>
      <li>It builds up after the first use.</li>
      <li>I have been buying this hairspray from Walmart and they are smaller containers and cost more than what I purchased through Amazon.</li>

      <li>However, I would recommend an extra strong hairspray from the drugstore as I did not find this out of their league.</li>
      <li>This is the only hairspray that will hold my fine hair in place.</li>
      <li>The first day was good and touchable but the second day it was stiff.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
      <li>Then I style a little more and spray all over.  </li>
      <li>BUT it exploded the first week and nothing is left in the can.</li>
      <li>Does a great job,  a little expensive., but worth it according to her.</li>

    <li> Love the product. BUT it exploded the first week and nothing is left in the can. Very disappointed</li>
    <li> The only hairspray my wife will  buy.  Does a great job,  a little expensive., but worth it according to her.</li>
    <li> Excellent hairspray. It&#x27;s been my favorite for years. I have flat hair that doesn&#x27;t hold a curl without this</li>
    <li> Very tough hold! Reminds me a bit like hairspray they would use in the 40&#x27;s/50&#x27;s given the scent and extreme hold. It does look a little crunchy if you over apply in one area. I have not had a problem with any of my up do&#x27;s coming undone with this product. You get a lot of it! However, I would recommend an extra strong hairspray from the drugstore as I did not find this out of their league.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t spray on a ton, and maybe that&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t have the issues some people have.  My hair is medium length, straight, fine, but not thin.  I use mousse, and sometimes spray to prevent heat damage and/or a shine product.  I style, then lift my hair and spray in the under layers.  Then I style a little more and spray all over.  I usually repeat the procedure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following day(s) that I don&#x27;t wash my hair, I sometimes repeat; or, if it seems to have a lot of body, I just brush and spray. This spray does not weigh it down. I don&#x27;t use a lot on the final spray, because I don&#x27;t like a manicured look.</li>
    <li> Wife loves it and the price was better on Amazon than anywhere else I found.</li>
    <li> This is the only hairspray that will hold my fine hair in place. I can&#x27;t live without it! I have been using this product for a couple of years. I would recommend this to anyone who has hard to manage hair or who likes their hair to stay put once they have styled it.</li>
    <li> ... and your hair still moves.</li>
    <li> This is my wife&#x27;s favorite hair spray and the price is right.</li>
