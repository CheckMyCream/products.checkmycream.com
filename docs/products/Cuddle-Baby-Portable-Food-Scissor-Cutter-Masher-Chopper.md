      <li>I loved them so much I bought another as stocking stuffers for my nieces.</li>
      <li>So beautiful, well made, I can not say enough.</li>
      <li>Beautiful headbands, better then I expected!</li>
      <li>but they fit.</li>
      <li>they can fit a newborn up to a teenager...</li>
      <li>For the price they are very well made and look adorable.</li>
      <li>One of the tops came in glued after a short while, but loved them otherwise</li>
      <li>They are well worth the money you pay for them, honestly you can&#x27;t even buy the things and make them for this price, its comes out more expensive to do so, very satisfied customer :)</li>
      <li>It came in an assortment of colors and shipped quickly.</li>
      <li>They are very cute headbands, just wish they were bigger.</li>
      <li>Loved working with this company they totally put customer&#x27;s needs first.  </li>
      <li>They are adorable and come in pretty much every color to match any outfit.</li>
      <li>These are beautiful headbands and I will definitely buy more of the other styles.</li>
      <li>old and they fit fine.</li>
      <li>Also tried them on my 3yr old and they also fit her fine.</li>
      <li>Worth the price, took a week to receive.</li>
      <li>To me this was a steal and worth every penny.</li>
      <li>They fit her perfectly right now without too much movement.</li>
      <li>These are really cute headbands, especially for the price.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping too!</li>
      <li>and they&#x27;re so pretty</li>
      <li>Will definitely place another order love the headbands</li>
      <li>I love the product overall though.</li>
      <li>Needless to say i&#x27;m very particular when it comes these things, but these impressed me!!!</li>
      <li>the kids got sooo many compliments wearing these...well made and the little pearl in the middle makes them look elegant.</li>
      <li>so they don&#x27;t need to stand up to much abuse.</li>
      <li>The elastic is very stretchy</li>
      <li>some of the colors are not very pretty, mainly the highlighter bright yellow.</li>
      <li>They fit well but leave a minor line on her head.  </li>
      <li>My 4 month old looks so pretty with them on.</li>
      <li>of course it was the greg one which is the one I was most looking forward to using on our little one.</li>
      <li>They fit loosely on my 5 month old daughters head</li>
      <li>Only thing to note is that some of the headbands don&#x27;t match the flower&#x27;s color exactly.</li>
      <li>They fit well and stay on, despite my very active baby girl.</li>
      <li>Bought them for my 19lb. 8 month old.  </li>
      <li>so my 22 month old can also wear them.</li>
      <li>I make all of my baby&#x27;s hair accessories, as I have for my five year old daughter.</li>
      <li>Not a huge deal, but would&#x27;ve been nice to have that other color!</li>
      <li>The gems were supposed to all be clear, some came grey (and the grey stones really stand out)</li>
      <li>shipped fast, but were all too tight for my 8 month old.</li>
      <li>So adorable and not too tight on her little head (she does have a little head btw, so if your baby has a very large head, these might be too tight).</li>

    <li> Thsee headbands are so cute. My only complaint is sizing is not every specific online and one of the headbands was missing it&#x27;s gem in the middle. of course it was the greg one which is the one I was most looking forward to using on our little one. Guess I&#x27;ll buy something at Michaels and glue it one, but I shouldn&#x27;t have to do this. QC of product could have been b3yter before shipping it out.</li>
    <li> Received headbands ...and loved them.  Loved working with this company they totally put customer&#x27;s needs first.  I would definitely recommend their product.</li>
    <li> I thought for sure I&#x27;d be disappointed because of the low price but these are cute, quality bows. The colors are just as pictured. They fit loosely on my 5 month old daughters head but they fit. Such a great deal!</li>
    <li> Lovely,  very satisfied with the product and delivery time.</li>
    <li> These are adorable headbands, good variety for great price! However, my pack came with two of the baby pinks and I didn&#x27;t get a coral color. Not a huge deal, but would&#x27;ve been nice to have that other color! I can&#x27;t wait to try these on my baby when she gets here!</li>
    <li> I love these for my daughter an she always gets so many compliments when she is wearing one!!</li>
    <li> One of the tops came in glued after a short while, but loved them otherwise</li>
    <li> Purchased for my granddaughter who lives in London, England.  Will be sending them to her next week.  On the surface they look good, would like to see how they hold up after she starts wearing them.  All in all, very cute!</li>
    <li> Came in the mail a bit earlier than promised.  Headbands just as described. They fit my 5 yr old perfect</li>
    <li> Beautiful headbands, better then I expected!</li>
    <li> These are really cute headbands, especially for the price. Only thing to note is that some of the headbands don&#x27;t match the flower&#x27;s color exactly. It&#x27;s not a big difference at all, otherwise I would have rated &amp;#34;5&amp;#34; stars.</li>
    <li> Just as pictured! So beautiful and fit nicely on my 9 month old.</li>
    <li> Love these. Great quality and a bargain if you ask me.</li>

    <li> These look so cute on my baby.  Good quality, affordable and colors are accurate in the picture.</li>
    <li> the color not good and it look like not new a lot of sand i see and it fall from it a lot of yarns</li>
    <li> The gems were supposed to all be clear, some came grey (and the grey stones really stand out) just looks junky. The sizing was small.</li>
    <li> For the price they are very well made and look adorable. I purchased for my almost 7 mo. old and they fit fine. Also tried them on my 3yr old and they also fit her fine. Fast shipping too!</li>
    <li> These headbands are really cute &amp; affordable! They fit well and stay on, despite my very active baby girl. I would buy these again!</li>

    <li> I ordered these for a friends baby shower. They arrived quickly and are great quality. It came in an assortment of colors and shipped quickly.</li>

    <li> Really cute.... love tham.</li>
    <li> Cute headbands fit my 4 month old very good. Worth the price, took a week to receive. thank you! I would buy again if i had to!</li>
    <li> My daughter wears a head band almost every day, and we receive lots of complements with the appearance of these!  They fit her perfectly right now without too much movement.</li>
    <li> Excellent deal! To me this was a steal and worth every penny. They are adorable and come in pretty much every color to match any outfit. I&#x27;m very pleased and would for sure recommend this to friend and family!</li>
    <li> Love them love them!&lt;br /&gt;They are beautiful and inexpensive. I bought one like that one before in another website and Just one costed me $4.&lt;br /&gt;the only thing the should improve is selling them by sizes. It is to tight. I think those are for babies 0-5 months. my baby is six months and I found it too tight for her.</li>
    <li> shipped fast, but were all too tight for my 8 month old. Recommended for 6 months or younger. They are very cute headbands, just wish they were bigger.</li>
    <li> Loved these!!! I make all of my baby&#x27;s hair accessories, as I have for my five year old daughter. Needless to say i&#x27;m very particular when it comes these things, but these impressed me!!! They are well worth the money you pay for them, honestly you can&#x27;t even buy the things and make them for this price, its comes out more expensive to do so, very satisfied customer :)</li>
    <li> Love love love these! They were too big for my newborn so I tied them in the back! They look so good! I can&#x27;t believe how cheap they were!</li>
    <li> The dark pink headband is missing it&#x27;s pearl.  I would have sent them back, but needed them for an event this weekend.</li>
    <li> The beads are a little rough looking on some of the bands, and it does fray some.  I love the product overall though. So adorable and not too tight on her little head (she does have a little head btw, so if your baby has a very large head, these might be too tight).</li>
    <li> So cute.  Great price.</li>
    <li> perfect for my 6 month old! i don&#x27;t normally put headbands on her because they are often too tight and leave a little mark on her head. these are so soft and the elastic is thin enough as to not leave a mark. some of the colors are not very pretty, mainly the highlighter bright yellow. the pinks white and grey are my favorites!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these headbands!!! My daughter gets complements on them all the time. Great quality and they&#x27;re so pretty, the colors are spot on. Great quality for the price.</li>
    <li> It may just be me but the one pictured on the baby doesn&#x27;t match the other headbands displayed, the gem on the headbands are different.</li>
    <li> Bought them for my 19lb. 8 month old.  They fit well but leave a minor line on her head.  The elastic is very stretchy so my 22 month old can also wear them. I would say that they would be an ideal size for a 3-4 month old.</li>
    <li> These are so adorable! Great price and really fast shipping. I am very satisfied with this product!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> my wife did not like them because they did not binieron like this, which reached were combined in two colors, so I will not give him a star or 👎</li>
    <li> Will definitely place another order love the headbands</li>
    <li> Bought one set before. I loved them so much I bought another as stocking stuffers for my nieces.</li>
    <li> I just got them and they are beautiful. My 4 month old looks so pretty with them on. Love them!</li>
    <li> Low cost, so lower quality but they&#x27;re for a newborn so they don&#x27;t need to stand up to much abuse. Cute though.</li>
