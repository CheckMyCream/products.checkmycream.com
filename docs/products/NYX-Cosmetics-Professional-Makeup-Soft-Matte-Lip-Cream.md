      <li>It&#x27;s a very bright pink, almost neon.</li>

      <li>It lasts a VERY long time and the color is really nice.</li>

      <li>This is a vibrant pink color with cool undertones.</li>
      <li>I liked it so much that I ordered it in a few other colors.</li>
      <li>Soft peachy color.</li>
      <li>It is not one of the &amp;#34;long lasting&amp;#34; lipsticks, and does need to be retouched throughout the day, however it DOES stay pretty well, and doesn&#x27;t make your lips feel overly dry OR sticky.</li>
      <li>I was surprised because it actually ships to Guam</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Obsessed with these matte lip creams. The color payoff and quality is awesome. Planning on actually all the colors that would match my skin tone.</li>
    <li> I love it!! I truly recommend! Perfect color just how I pictured it. Came on time!</li>
    <li> Ibiza is wayyyyy more pink than pictured here but I do like the matte formula and I wear it layered to tone down the pink. It&#x27;s decent, won&#x27;t buy this color again though.</li>
    <li> Too bright for me.  I was hoping the color would be closer to rose.  It&#x27;s like neon-pink.  I put a lighter color over it.</li>
    <li> Amazing it all I can say ðŸ˜˜</li>
    <li> Looked brighter online.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with this lip cream! Is beautiful!. But be careful, because the color can vary with your natural lips color. This color on me looks like coral o pink almost orange almost red. I love the matte finish, the smell and color. I definetly want more colors of this lip cream!</li>
    <li> Beautiful color!! Very sexy!!!</li>
    <li> I felt cheated.. The product did not last me a week ðŸ˜ŸðŸ˜ŸðŸ˜Ÿ</li>
    <li> Sorry amazon but I felt cheated ibiza colour does not seem like it shows on screen, product  is I must say it&#x27;s like not at all,almost dry, highly disappointed....my money also gone....disappointed...</li>
    <li> Love Love Love this matte lipstick! The shipping was quick, and the product (color included) was as described. I love the smell of this lip cream line... the best way to describe it is probably &amp;#34;cake&amp;#34;, and it sort of has the consistency of cake frosting. It really makes you want to lick it... although I wouldn&#x27;t. lol. As such, I don&#x27;t know as I would recommend it for children! haha. This is a vibrant pink color with cool undertones. It goes on smoothly with a pleasant creamy texture, can be used with or without lip liner (I prefer with), and dries to a matte finish within a minute or so. It is not one of the &amp;#34;long lasting&amp;#34; lipsticks, and does need to be retouched throughout the day, however it DOES stay pretty well, and doesn&#x27;t make your lips feel overly dry OR sticky. I&#x27;m also pleased with the fact that it sits on your lips well, and doesn&#x27;t crack or make any dry spots look blaringly obvious. The darker colors accomplish this better than the lighter colors (as is the case with most lipsticks). These are VERY pigmented as well. I wouldn&#x27;t mind owning most of this lip cream collection! I already have 6 of them! It&#x27;s one of my favs!</li>
    <li> Soft peachy color. Stays on well even when eating and drinking. No sticky feel. Lots of nice colors to try but this and Amsterdam are my favorites</li>
    <li> I love this. I will be buying all of the colors, it is that good. It stays on longer than most of my other lipsticks ever have before. If you&#x27;re a makeup enthusiast this is belongs in your collection.</li>
    <li> Best color and texture for me ever!!! Wish the staying power was longer though..&lt;br /&gt;Recommend this one! Had tons of compliments on it already :)</li>
    <li> Ibiza is easily my new favorite NYX Soft Matte, the color is perfect for day or night. Really complimented my skin tone (fair/medium) and you really don&#x27;t need to reapply it stays on forever</li>
    <li> All I can say is this is quality at its best. Color is perfect, formula does not dry lips, leaves a soft stain after while too!</li>
    <li> I really love the color. Shipped quickly and it&#x27;s even free shipping. I was surprised because it actually ships to Guam (: I love how it last long and it&#x27;s easy to apply. Definitely buying more if possible</li>
    <li> I thought the color would be red but it was pink-ish. also there was little product inside, and it was dry</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lip cream for a few days and I love it. It lasts a VERY long time and the color is really nice. I liked it so much that I ordered it in a few other colors. It isn&#x27;t sticky at all, it&#x27;s smooth and dries matte which is what makes it so long lasting. It also smells kind of like frosting which is quite pleasant.</li>
    <li> Quantity 2, but only one arrived</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very bright pink, almost neon. I always mix it with a darker pink lipstick just to tone down the color, and when I do it&#x27;s absolutely amazing! It is matte finishing, lasting a long time on the lip. Whenever you eat the color is still there, but it just fads alittle. It can be drying though. I always use lip balm before applying.</li>
    <li> Gave to my Daughter for Christmas. She loves this lip cream.</li>
    <li> I purchased this,and i absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> very good cover I love it</li>
