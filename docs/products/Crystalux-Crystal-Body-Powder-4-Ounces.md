### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Very impressed with this powdered deodorant!  </li>
      <li>The best part?  </li>
      <li>I use it to check wetness and odor all over, and it works wonderfully.</li>
      <li>This is a great product.  </li>
      <li>I use the crystal deodorant stone and this powder together and I love it!!  </li>
      <li>Product still works great, and feels good going on, to me.</li>
      <li>Good drying effect without all of the chemicals and preservatives.  </li>
      <li>But the product itself I&#x27;ve always loved</li>
      <li>Love this product!</li>
      <li>This powder is the best odor absorbing one i have ever used.</li>
      <li>The best powder out there for keeping the body fresh and bacteria free.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very fine powder that doesn&#x27;t get sticky or clumpy when dampened, and vitually disappears after being worn for a while.</li>
      <li>, works great to use in shoes during the hot days of summer</li>
      <li>Love the product, didn&#x27;t care for the seller.</li>
      <li>The container has fewer holes in the top, and they are more closely clustered together on the lid.  </li>
      <li>I wish more sellers stocked it--</li>
      <li>Now that I&#x27;m a grown woman with knowledge of how talcs and powders can be harmful to your skin (and lungs), I was so pleased to discover this powdered crystal alternative.</li>
      <li>Excellent product and is unobtainable locally</li>
      <li>Better than any over the counter</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I struggled with strong order but refused to continue using poison anti perspirant/deoderant.</li>
      <li>No odor, stay almost completely dry, and best of all, no bad chemicals.</li>
      <li>I started using this about 5 years ago in combination with a chemical free tea tree oil stick deodorant ( found at most Natural foods stores or natural Vitamin stores), and the two combined do a great job, even in the sweltering heat of an Arizona summer.</li>
      <li>clean and no scent</li>
      <li>The salt in it completely prevents odor, and the powder feels nice and is talc-free.  </li>
      <li>would recommend this product to anyone who wears deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also very fast delivery!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always liked using powder after a shower to feel dry and smooth before dressing.</li>
      <li>I love that it is such a fine dusting, too.</li>
      <li>One hundred percent pure and natural, sure....</li>
      <li>Product never fails.  </li>
      <li>I was married in august on a humid day and sweated all day...</li>
      <li>This powder works very well.&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning up my diet also helped!</li>
      <li>This is an improvement to the package, IMO; it makes it easier to get out just the right amount, and not end up with too much of the cornstarch.  </li>
      <li>and I can spray my powder container with a little Fiji and dust myself for a light scent!!  </li>
      <li>Now I suppose I should have researched it a bit more instead of relying on a (misleading) description and single picture on Amazon, but</li>
      <li>It works great when you want to get dry rather than wet coverage.</li>
      <li>Plus, it left huge powdery residue all over the inside of the armpit area of my clothing.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>really...  </li>
      <li>This stuff really works for me, I fix computers on a campus and get from building to building on foot with my tools/laptop in a backpack.  </li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s always worked really great for me and usually I&#x27;ll layer it with a natural powder deodorant from Lush cosmetics as well.</li>
      <li>I think the salt crystals are a bit larger / more coarse than they used o be.  </li>
      <li>even at end of this long day i smelled shower fresh!</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this.</li>
      <li>While the product touts that it is &amp;#34;100% Pure and Natural Crystal Deodorant,&amp;#34; there&#x27;s a reason that statement appears on two lines.  </li>
      <li>The product is a bit different now, from when I first bought it.  </li>
      <li>all day-- helps keep odors away on hot days, but it totally fragrance-free.</li>
      <li>I can apply it directly to just-shaved skin without irritation!  </li>
      <li>and I stay fresh and dry</li>
      <li>It contains no talc and is completely natural.  </li>
      <li>I was looking for a natural, talc-free, unscented body powder.</li>
      <li>In the summer on a busy day I can end up drenched in sweat, this stuff keeps me from smelling</li>
      <li>The other liquid crystal deodorants really irritate my sensitive skin!  </li>
      <li>Ingredients:  &amp;#34;Pure topical cornstarch, natural mineral salts.&amp;#34;  </li>
      <li>I use only the natural stuff now.</li>

<li> I guess I&#x27;ll use it to powder my bum, since that&#x27;s what I feel like after being duped into thinking I was getting 100% pure and natural crushed crystal rock deodorant instead of something I could have whipped up in my kitchen, with probably only a minimal negative effect on efficacy</li>

<li> Sorry but this body powder did not do a lick of deodorizing for me.</li>
<li> Its gotten rather expensive since I started buying.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, I had already dumped the contents into a container that was conducive to dipping a powder applicator and recycled the bottle; otherwise, I would have returned the item.  </li>

    <li> I struggled with strong order but refused to continue using poison anti perspirant/deoderant. This powder works very well.&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning up my diet also helped!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always liked using powder after a shower to feel dry and smooth before dressing. My grandma used to let me use her Oscar deLaRenta powder puff when I went to visit her, and it made me feel so fancy! Now that I&#x27;m a grown woman with knowledge of how talcs and powders can be harmful to your skin (and lungs), I was so pleased to discover this powdered crystal alternative. One little dusting and I stay fresh and dry all day-- helps keep odors away on hot days, but it totally fragrance-free. I wish more sellers stocked it-- Its gotten rather expensive since I started buying. But I will continue to order-- I have never found anything like it. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a natural, talc-free, unscented body powder. I have just tried this Crystalux product, and I&#x27;m sold. I&#x27;ve already re-ordered and will stock up. It&#x27;s a very fine powder that doesn&#x27;t get sticky or clumpy when dampened, and vitually disappears after being worn for a while. I use it to check wetness and odor all over, and it works wonderfully. Shhh. Let&#x27;s keep it our little secret.</li>
    <li> Love the product, didn&#x27;t care for the seller. I received the bottle opened and half empty. But the product itself I&#x27;ve always loved, it&#x27;s always worked really great for me and usually I&#x27;ll layer it with a natural powder deodorant from Lush cosmetics as well.</li>

    <li> The powder is easier to use.</li>
    <li> Sorry but this body powder did not do a lick of deodorizing for me. Plus, it left huge powdery residue all over the inside of the armpit area of my clothing. Ick.</li>

    <li> While the product touts that it is &amp;#34;100% Pure and Natural Crystal Deodorant,&amp;#34; there&#x27;s a reason that statement appears on two lines.  One hundred percent pure and natural, sure....but it is NOT 100% crystal deodorant the way you might think.  I thought I was getting powdered crystal deodorant, as in, one of those deodorant rocks crushed up.  However, what they really mean is that it&#x27;s a deodorant that contains crystal.  The majority of this product is actually cornstarch.  Ingredients:  &amp;#34;Pure topical cornstarch, natural mineral salts.&amp;#34;  Now I suppose I should have researched it a bit more instead of relying on a (misleading) description and single picture on Amazon, but really...  Unfortunately, I had already dumped the contents into a container that was conducive to dipping a powder applicator and recycled the bottle; otherwise, I would have returned the item.  As an underarm deodorant, by the way, it doesn&#x27;t work as well as Kiss My Face Liquid Rock (whose only downside is that it takes forever to dry), and the powder mixes with your sweat and leaves a crusty whiteness.  I guess I&#x27;ll use it to powder my bum, since that&#x27;s what I feel like after being duped into thinking I was getting 100% pure and natural crushed crystal rock deodorant instead of something I could have whipped up in my kitchen, with probably only a minimal negative effect on efficacy (I do wonder about the ratio of cornstarch:mineral salts...)</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  The salt in it completely prevents odor, and the powder feels nice and is talc-free.  You may find it for a lower price by Googling the product&#x27;s name and doing some comparison shopping.  EDIT on November 30, 2015: The product is a bit different now, from when I first bought it.  The container has fewer holes in the top, and they are more closely clustered together on the lid.  This is an improvement to the package, IMO; it makes it easier to get out just the right amount, and not end up with too much of the cornstarch.  The product, itself, feels a bit different, too.  I think the salt crystals are a bit larger / more coarse than they used o be.  Product still works great, and feels good going on, to me.</li>
    <li> I use the crystal deodorant stone and this powder together and I love it!!  It contains no talc and is completely natural.  Additionally I wanted a scented powder to use with a powder puff - the fragrance I like no longer makes a scented body powder so this comes unscented and I can spray my powder container with a little Fiji and dust myself for a light scent!!  Highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly and product is as described.</li>
    <li> Good drying effect without all of the chemicals and preservatives.  I love that it is such a fine dusting, too.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve tried everything else, TRY THIS!!!  Very impressed with this powdered deodorant!  No scent, and I can apply it directly to just-shaved skin without irritation!  The other liquid crystal deodorants really irritate my sensitive skin!  The best part?  I live in an extremely hot/humid environment, can sweat all day, and still have NO ODOR!</li>
    <li> This stuff really works for me, I fix computers on a campus and get from building to building on foot with my tools/laptop in a backpack.  In the summer on a busy day I can end up drenched in sweat, this stuff keeps me from smelling like I just left the gym lasts all day, 8+ hours.</li>
    <li> This powder is the best odor absorbing one i have ever used. I was married in august on a humid day and sweated all day...even at end of this long day i smelled shower fresh!</li>
    <li> Excellent product and is unobtainable locally</li>
    <li> The best powder out there for keeping the body fresh and bacteria free. Love this stuff. It truly works.</li>
    <li> clean and no scent so I like it, works great to use in shoes during the hot days of summer</li>
    <li> I gave up all commercial deodorants several years ago due the to aluminum that they contain and the proximity to breast tissue. I use only the natural stuff now. You can get it in liquid or the rock form. This is the rock form ground up into a powder. It works great when you want to get dry rather than wet coverage. I had a very hard time finding it and I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s still being made. I used to get it at Earth Fare, but then it was gone from there, although the brand was not. I hoard this, usually using the roll on and letting it dry.</li>
