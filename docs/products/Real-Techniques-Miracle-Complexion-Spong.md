      <li>But if you are look for a tool that gives you medium to full coverage, a foundation brush may do a better job since this sponge is for more natural and light-cover finish.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a loyal user.</li>
      <li>I have used it multiple times and its very easy to clean.</li>
      <li>I used to spend more and get the Beauty Blender, but I actually like the shape of the Real Techniques better.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure people have gotten the real ones, but the ones i received are definitely not real... Less bouncy and absorbs way too much water and overall not as good. So, i&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s hit or miss when you order these.</li>
    <li> These are so soft and spongy! I love getting 2x&#x27;s the price of one.  I don&#x27;t own a beauty blender because I&#x27;m cheap-lol! I just couldn&#x27;t rationalize paying all that money for 1 sponge. RTech blender meets the functionality and my budget. Buy them, you would not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Absorbs way to much product and it has some darks spots on it that I can&#x27;t remove. I&#x27;m not Sure if I got the real sponges...</li>
    <li> After using a real Beautyblender, this feels tough. It&#x27;s not bad for applying foundation or even blush, but I much prefer the softness of my beauty blender. I&#x27;ll keep using this though and maybe I&#x27;ll find something that a firmer sponge can do compared to a much softer sponge.</li>
    <li> The best sponge ever!!! And I have tried them all. Example Ive tried Sephora&#x27;s brand, the real beauty blender ( which that is wonderful but expensive), and off shot that I bought off ebay coming from China for $1.50 and this brand. All the other sponges I have tried never match up to snuff to the real beauty blender. I have found u want 1 that is very soft when u squeeze it. And this 1 is. Plus I like the dual sides on this. The flat side u can use for spreading the foundation around then u can go back and pounce it against the skin. An the pointed side works wonders for around the eyes nose or any crany areas ur trying to reach. The only thing I have found about this sponge compared to the the real blender thats a con is it doesn&#x27;t last as long. But for the price u can buy 4 of these for 1 of the other.</li>
    <li> This is everything that i wanted. I have used it multiple times and its very easy to clean. Just use a little dish washing liquid and some olive oil and its like new again. Love it</li>
    <li> this is a great products, denser than a beauty blender but just as soft. It&#x27;s not as good as the beauty blender, it takes  a bit more work but for the 15 dollars im saving  from having to re purchase a new bb i do not mind at all. love this and it&#x27;s so easy to clean</li>
    <li> Good but not great, it&#x27;s not a Beauty Blender, but it&#x27;s a fraction of the cost and works great. I love the flat end which the BB doesn&#x27;t have. I would buy again, but if someone else was buying for me... I would ask for the Beauty Blender (I have no shame lol)</li>
    <li> I love this sponge! I would never spend more on another blender. That&#x27;s not to say that the Beauty Blender or Stila blender aren&#x27;t as good or better but the difference for the cost is not justifiable to me. The only difference that I notice is that this one holds on to more water but I just give it an extra squeeze inside a towel after wringing it out and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> ah i love this way better deal to get 2 then just one. I use it and wash it every day no nicks or chunks coming out of it at all.</li>
    <li> I think it works just fine... Its a dupe for beauty blender</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never tried any other beauty blender to compare this with, but I love it!  I guess I can compare it to those triangle sponges from the ninety&#x27;s I used to use in high school (which were AWEFUL).  So needless to say, this sponge is 100% better than those.  I only use it damp, and after I&#x27;ve tapped my foundation on my skin in the general area I want it.  Then I go back over with the sponge to smooth it out and cover everything else I want to.  It leaves a wonderful finish.  Pretty flawless.</li>
    <li> This is a sponge and love having one pointed end and flat end. Perfect for applying your foundation. Works great!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! We threw away our Beauty Blenders and are planning on re-purchasing when these are ready to be replaced!</li>
    <li> First time i tried this product i was amazed at how it improved the look of the makeup on my skin. I had no makeup line from chin to neck. And the appearance of my skin was natural but yet had coverage.&lt;br /&gt;Use damp for best results. Squeeze in your fist, do not twist to ring out water. I twisted and i damaged my sponge. Small pits in the sponge. My fault thoroughly. It still works great. Experiment with all angles of the sponge to see what works best for you. You will not be disappointed. This product gave me more of a airbrushed look, no caking. I&#x27;m 47, with age comes, brown spots, uneven skin, dark cirles, puffy eyes and i can really say i see a huge improvement from my other foundation techniques, which was, regular sponges, concealer brush, stippling brush and my fingers. I still use the same cosmetics with this new techniques sponge. I&#x27;m always looking for new and improved ways to keep myself looking as youthful as possible. So there you have it.</li>
    <li> I have buy this product before buying it on Amazon. I was a little worried when I read another review about it being a fake, but I tried it aways. The difference between the sponges are not really apparent right away. I noticed after I put on my foundation with this sponge that it looked as if I put it on with a sponge. My foundation did not look flawless like it did with my previous sponge. Once there was foundation on the sponge there was a clear difference that this one was a fake. The holes in the sponge are very clear as for my other sponge you can&#x27;t see them. You might not realize this if you have never bought it before. If you want this sponge buy from Walmart&#x27;s website. It works wonders!</li>
    <li> AWESOME SPONGE!!!!!!!!! You will definitely retire your foundation brushes for a while after using this!!! It gives smooth application of foundation and is PERFECT for blending out concealers during contouring and highlighting. Should be used damp for best results. Just place the sponge in water and squeeze completely dry before using (If you don&#x27;t have MAC Fix plus spray). I was very skeptical to buy the two pack since I had never used this sponge before, but i must say, I&#x27;m glad that I now have not one, but TWO great sponges.</li>
    <li> i love these sponges. really easy to use and cleans well with dr. bronner&#x27;s soap. i have beauty blenders and i find these to be comparable; it is a high quality sponge material. the shape of these makes putting foundation and concealer on an effortless experience. i have not experienced any mold or material breakdown/tears with these. i recommend!</li>
    <li> I love the sponge. I use it over my nice buffing foundation brush most of the time now. It holds up pretty good as well.</li>
    <li> Ok update on my review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought the 2 pack about 5 times and I&#x27;d say 2 out of the 5 were the real thing. The other 3 were fakes, not as puffy and smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend the sponge, just not from this seller.</li>
    <li> Works very well, only note I have for new users is MAKE SURE YOU CLEAN IT REGULARLY! I clean mine at least once every 2 weeks, it basically restores the product to its original state.</li>
    <li> Yes yes yes I absolutely LOVE these! Easy to use and easy to clean, exactly like the beauty blender but way better priced. Great for use of foundation of any kind</li>
    <li> This is not a dupe of the original Beauty blender,  it&#x27;s just like all the others but just softer but you can&#x27;t beat Beauty blender at all!  Too bad cause the price was amazing compared to Beauty blender</li>
    <li> Excellent product give &amp;#34;airbrushed&amp;#34; makeup effect for us lazy girls. The point at the end (and &amp;#34;stippling&amp;#34; technique) helps camouflage imperfections and blemishes. Low cost dupe for BeautyBlender. Washable! Would buy again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good for applying foundations which have a thinker texture (cream or lotion like foundation)! Better used if it&#x27;s wet and swelled (feels softer and smoother) because it really helps the foundation to blend in! But if you are look for a tool that gives you medium to full coverage, a foundation brush may do a better job since this sponge is for more natural and light-cover finish.</li>
    <li> Love this sponge. Better than the beauty blender. Definitely will be a staple in my makeup aresenal!</li>
    <li> I have always loves these sponges, they key is that you HAVE to get it wet or it will just soak up all of your expensive foundation.Get it damp, squeeze out all the excess water, and dab gently into makeup and onto face. I like the scalloped edge because it gets right under my eyes and RIGHT to the edge of my hair line. Amazing product, amazing price.</li>
    <li> Bought these because I wanted a beauty blender but did not feel like dishing out $20 for something that I would have to replace eventually. Needless to say I am VERY happy with my decision. This is the easiest way to achieve the flawless, air-brushed foundation look that we all desire. There really is nothing bad that I can say about this product! I am so happy that I found it and plan on ordering many more in the future.</li>
    <li> These are not real Real Technique sponges! Do not buy them! They are hard and they truly suck!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very useful for me!</li>
    <li> Love these sponges.  Good quality, holds up well to washing and applies makeup beautifully.</li>
    <li> WAY better than the other, more expensive beauty blenders out there. I&#x27;m a loyal user.</li>
    <li> I prefer my beauty blender but this is such a great deal I could not pass it up. I kind of like the shape of this sponge better than the beauty blender because you have more options; however, the beauty blender is softer. Still a great sponge and I use it several times a week and it has maintained its shape beautifully.</li>
    <li> I really like this sponge. I thought it was going to be to stiff but when you wet it it definitely softens up. If you don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on the beauty blender this is a high quality dupe that will give you the same results</li>
    <li> This are beatiful! I dont have the Beauty Blender, but this its better than the average! Lovely.</li>
    <li> The only differences between this and the beauty blender are its shape, color and price! Works beautifully and is the only sponge I will now buy!</li>
    <li> Great blender! I am in my 40&#x27;s and this is the first time I have used a blending sponge.  My makeup looks even and airbrushed on.  I threw out all of this little triangle sponges I have used for so many years.  I love the flat end for blending forehead and cheeks, the pointed end for blending around the eyes and the sides for overall blending.  It is easy to clean and the two pack is a great deal.</li>
    <li> Awesome sponge! Applies foundation beautifully once it&#x27;s damp</li>
    <li> I love this sponge. My opinion of these are just as high as a beauty blender. I bought two of these for half the price of one beauty blender. It applies just as well if not better. My foundation is flawless when I use this. In my opinion this would be better then a beauty blender because of the flat bottom. I use the pointy part for under and around my eyes and around my nose. I use the flat end or side for the rest of my face. I also use this to apply cream products. If you haven&#x27;t bought this you are definitely missing out.</li>
    <li> love this sponge. works great and the price is great as well</li>
    <li> Best Beauty Sponges out there. Way better than the Beauty Blender. Its soft and really bounces off your skin.</li>
    <li> I love these sponges, they&#x27;re easy to clean and they work great for liquid items!</li>
    <li> Best sponge I have used. I like it better than the beauty blender and it&#x27;s less expensive.</li>
    <li> it very easy to use and blind the foundation very well. I like it a lot</li>
    <li> Great blender. The only thing I dislike is how much product these suck up in them. When I wash them out I see lots of my foundation washing down the drain. But for the price and the over all product these are very good.</li>
    <li> Omg I absolutely love this sponge. Works better than a beauty blender, easier than a brush. I will never be without. Thanks!!!</li>
    <li> Loved this sponge! Waaaay better and cheaper than the beauty blender.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves them</li>
    <li> These makeup sponges are just as awesome as all of the reviews have claimed them to be! I rely heavily on reading product reviews before making most of my online purchases. I bought these sponges solely based on their rave reviews. In all honesty, I was expecting to find that they worked exactly the same as my usual foundation sponge but I was very wrong. Now I understand why many of the reviews expressed such utter excitement! Gotta tell ya, writing that down and acknowledging it feels a bit alien and incredibly awkward but it is very true! So if you are anything like me, you may be reading these reviews and thinking that we must have all grown up together in Crazy Town for all of us to sing such praises over a sponge. Weeks later, I am still totally impressed!</li>
    <li> I have purchased the &amp;#34;Real Technique&amp;#34; Sponges for sometime, but from a different site and these were NOT the same sponges! The bounce and texture is completely different, they are hard, and useless. They use to be a great &amp;#34;Beauty Blender&amp;#34; dupe. Please fix it how it was before, because I truly loved these sponges or Amazon please get rid of these counterfeit sponges! So disappointed.</li>
    <li> Mine where FAKE ! I already had one that was old and I needed to get new ones and because I loved them so much I decided to get the 2 pack which where fake they where super hard and my make up looked horrible !!! I would have returned them but because I used them months later I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s to late so annoyed</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see myself ever buying a beauty blender because this thing is the bomb.com and makes me look flawless and very well blended.</li>
    <li> Very excellent prodect</li>
    <li> I got counterfeit ones!!! I love the Real Techniques sponge because it&#x27;s really soft, but these sponges were really hard. And I know this for a fact because i compared them side by side with the same Real Techniques sponges I bought from Ulta and Tom Thumb. I received mine about a month back but just opened them today as I was still using the older ones I had. Maybe other customers got the genuine product but I know I didn&#x27;t. Disappointed! Edit: I decided to post pictures of what I received. In all the pics, the one on the left is a new genuine product, and the one on the right is the fake product i received. If you observe clearly, the porosity of the right (fake) product is much lesser, which is what makes it so much harder than the genuine product. also, the shape of the edge is rounder in the genuine product but more egg-shaped in the fake product. I did not pay for low-quality counterfeit products and I want my money back!  EDIT: The seller has agreed to give me a refund, so I don&#x27;t blame the seller.</li>
    <li> Great sponges smooth make up application !</li>
    <li> Too much money Ulta has these same set for 10.99</li>
    <li> I used it for the first time yesterday. I looked up youtube videos to check if it was a fake. It wasn&#x27;t. I was able to apply my foundation flawlessly.&lt;br /&gt;It is a great deal, compared to one for 7$ , I got two for 10.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> I saw other reviewers saying they recieved fakes.  Mine were definitely real. I used to spend more and get the Beauty Blender, but I actually like the shape of the Real Techniques better. The feel is comparable to the more expensive Beauty Blender. These are not your standard makeup sponges. They are very soft and blend wonderfully. I&#x27;ve found store versions to be very stiff and more like a traditional sponge. And since these can last a typical 3 months each, they&#x27;re better price wise than normal sponge wedges. If you haven&#x27;t tried either beauty sponges, opt for this cheaper one first.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gotten the real techniques sponge before in store and I loved it. I had it for almost a year so it was getting old and I needed a new one. I decided to buy it from Amazon because I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores anywhere. I got the two pack and they work great. I have no issues blending my foundation and concealer. The only thing is the texture is different from the sponge I bought in store; that&#x27;s why i think the ones I got from Amazon are fake. It still does a great job but I think you will notice that it&#x27;s different from the in store ones</li>
    <li> I was really disappointed when I received these. THEY ARE FAKE!! Trust me I bought a genuine real techniques sponge from ulta a while back unfortunately I lost it so I bought these. They were a waste of money because they are realy stiff and didn&#x27;t expand much when I soaked them with water like the real ones do. I&#x27;m not sure if only some are fake because there seems to be positive reviews but I&#x27;m certain the ones I received were.</li>
    <li> its genial this product</li>
    <li> I love these things! It makes my make up even all over and is great for blending for contouring.</li>
    <li> I love these sponges for applying my foundation.  Just wet them a tad then they blend wonderfully.</li>
