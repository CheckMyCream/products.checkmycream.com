      <li>The smell is a grown up vanilla smell but with hints of wood as well making it a mature 20 somethings perfect scent.</li>

      <li>Very light.</li>
      <li>I love the smell......</li>

      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>We love this product.</li>
      <li>My second time not getting authentic products from Amazon!!!!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an ok perfume, but I don&#x27;t like it</li>
      <li>Love the scent.</li>
      <li>I am just so pleased to get it at such a a great price.</li>
      <li>so I am fine with that.</li>
      <li>Came through the mail quickly and safely.</li>
      <li>The scent is very light and feminine with a nice soft floral tone.  </li>
      <li>This product is great and came timely before the actual delivery date.  </li>
      <li>Got this as a tester, liked it so much had to buy a bottle.</li>
      <li>Light, but fragrant.  </li>
      <li>super fast shipping and such a beautiful product!!!</li>
      <li>When I received it, I got excited</li>
      <li>So excited to find it at this price.</li>
      <li>It smells cheap and sickly sweet to me, never having smelled it before I can&#x27;t say if it&#x27;s supposed to smell this way or not.</li>
      <li>I cannot find my original review to update it</li>
      <li>It is sweet.</li>
      <li>I was happy to find this for a much lower price online than in my local department store.</li>
      <li>Luckily the perfume bottle itself was undamaged.</li>
      <li>A very pretty scent.  </li>
      <li>( I will say the bottle is very pretty).  </li>
      <li>The price is much lower than buying at a traditional retail store, and I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase - highly recommended!</li>
      <li>Well, I guess I&#x27;m pretty impressionable, but I felt like I just had to have it after reading her blog.  </li>
      <li>It is the first thing i put in my hand luggage when i travel.</li>
      <li>Reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>There wasn&#x27;t much to it.  </li>
      <li>This is not the real perfume.</li>
      <li>The overall aroma evokes light vanilla.</li>
      <li>Hopefully I will be able to see this one as will others so they are advised that it may not be delivered as promised as the other posts state.  </li>
      <li>I had not purchased a full size simply because of the retail price.</li>
      <li>Soft, light scent but enough to leave people asking what perfume it is, everyone I run into when wearing it asks what it is.</li>
      <li>I bought this without smelling it first, I&#x27;m a total perfume junkie and the reviews sounded promising, but it smells like something an old lady would order out of an Avon catalogue.</li>
      <li>Oh, well, live and learn...</li>
      <li>It is not heavy, so when you put it on the people around you won&#x27;t sniffle or move away.  </li>
      <li>Men were wildly attracted to it, she claimed,  and she was overwhelmed with compliments from strangers whenever she wore it.  </li>
      <li>Maybe I got an old bottle or</li>
      <li>I was thrilled to receive this perfume, but quite irritated when I opened the box to find the glass lid to the bottle broken severely.</li>
      <li>However, after using it a few times, it does not seem to be as potent as my previous bottle, which I did purchase in a department store several years ago.</li>

<li> Unfortunately I can&#x27;t return it because fragrance can&#x27;t be sent back.  </li>
<li> It is hard to write reviews being as smell-o-vision has not been invented</li>
<li> Maybe a faint smell of figs, not especially pleasant.</li>
<li> I conclude that it&#x27;s a fake or very very very POOR quality since the longest it stays on me is about few minutes.</li>
<li> IT&#x27;S FAKE.</li>
<li> im obsessed with all hanae mori fragrances.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
<li> Worst of all, I myself did not like the scent.</li>

    <li> This is my new favorite perfume, and this is an awesome place to get a good value!  The scent is very light and feminine with a nice soft floral tone.  And the bottle is absolutely gorgeous.  The price is much lower than buying at a traditional retail store, and I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase - highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this stuff in an online cosmetics order some time ago and I have been hanging on to the tiny sample spray bottle for as long as I can. I had not purchased a full size simply because of the retail price. I ordered from this site and for 40$ less than the retail site. The smell is a grown up vanilla smell but with hints of wood as well making it a mature 20 somethings perfect scent. It is hard to write reviews being as smell-o-vision has not been invented But this smell says &#x27;I&#x27;m here to do good work but don&#x27;t think I ain&#x27;t gonna party after this.&#x27; As far as the bottle, it is very chic and thin with frosted glass on the decorative cap and on the sides of the bottle itself. Shipping took about two weeks but it is the holiday and I did save a substantial amount of money so I am fine with that.</li>
    <li> I bought this without smelling it first, I&#x27;m a total perfume junkie and the reviews sounded promising, but it smells like something an old lady would order out of an Avon catalogue. It smells cheap and sickly sweet to me, never having smelled it before I can&#x27;t say if it&#x27;s supposed to smell this way or not. Maybe I got an old bottle or maybe my skin chemistry just didn&#x27;t agree with it, either way, I&#x27;m tossing it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an ok perfume, but I don&#x27;t like it that much.&lt;br /&gt;My other perfumes are Tresor Lumineuse by Lancome and Aqua Di Giova by Armani.&lt;br /&gt;Just to give an idea what my tastes are like.</li>
    <li> im obsessed with all hanae mori fragrances.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS! I tried this as a sample at a mall and I had to try again! now I totally love it!</li>
    <li> I have received a small sample of this with my beauty purchase from Macy&#x27;s. But I couldn&#x27;t find it in Macy&#x27;s to buy it. I was very very happy to find it on Amazon with such a great price. When I received it, I got excited b/c it&#x27;s the same thing I expected to be like the same smell. BUT it doesn&#x27;t stay on my skin at all like the sample used to. I conclude that it&#x27;s a fake or very very very POOR quality since the longest it stays on me is about few minutes. I do remember that when I sprayed the sample on my skin, it would have stayed for hours. I do recommend NOT to BUY IT. IT&#x27;S FAKE.</li>
    <li> The overall aroma evokes light vanilla. Just a wonderful fragrance. The quality of the product met my expectations and the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> Love the scent. Very light. Just wish it lasted a bit longer.</li>
    <li> I was thrilled to receive this perfume, but quite irritated when I opened the box to find the glass lid to the bottle broken severely. Luckily the perfume bottle itself was undamaged.</li>
    <li> Two stars because I received the blue instead of the pink ( which is pictured).</li>
    <li> Unexpectedly great scent. Light, but fragrant.  Reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> Got this as a tester, liked it so much had to buy a bottle. The price through Amazon is much more affordable than the store where I got the tester!  Came through the mail quickly and safely.</li>
    <li> We love this product. The absolute best scent on the market. It is great as a perfume and as eau de toilette. They have this for men and women and we both have it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for a gift for my daughter.  It was promised by the 23 or 24.  I eventually received it on Monday, December 30, 2013 not in time for Christmas as promised.  My daughter loves the perfume but I would not recommend this seller.  Do not promise something and not deliver.  Yes I got my money refunded and got to keep the perfume but my daughter had ONE gift to open for Christmas - even the dog got two gifts.  I cannot find my original review to update it so I am combining it in this one.  Hopefully I will be able to see this one as will others so they are advised that it may not be delivered as promised as the other posts state.  NOT TRUE.</li>
    <li> This product is great and came timely before the actual delivery date.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> I love the smell......its like fresh delicate flowers.......cleaning smelling with a hint of vanilla</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this perfume with a Sephora order and just HAD to have it!  It lasts all day for me and one or two squirts was plenty!  Compliments galore!</li>
    <li> A very pretty scent.  It is not heavy, so when you put it on the people around you won&#x27;t sniffle or move away.  A good summer scent.  May not be for everyone.  It is sweet.</li>
    <li> It is a great scent.  Soft, light scent but enough to leave people asking what perfume it is, everyone I run into when wearing it asks what it is.</li>
    <li> I bought this, scent unsniffed, because a blogger I read regularly raved about this fragrance.  Men were wildly attracted to it, she claimed,  and she was overwhelmed with compliments from strangers whenever she wore it.  She said her friends all had the same experience with it, and recommended that other women wear it because it was a &amp;#34;man magnet&amp;#34;.  Well, I guess I&#x27;m pretty impressionable, but I felt like I just had to have it after reading her blog.  However, as they say on the commercials, &amp;#34;results may vary&amp;#34;.  Worst of all, I myself did not like the scent. There wasn&#x27;t much to it.  Maybe a faint smell of figs, not especially pleasant. ( I will say the bottle is very pretty).  Unfortunately I can&#x27;t return it because fragrance can&#x27;t be sent back.  Oh, well, live and learn...</li>
    <li> I love Hanae Mori.  I am just so pleased to get it at such a a great price.</li>
    <li> Excellent soft smell that stays with you all day! I always get compliments when I wear this perfume</li>
    <li> super fast shipping and such a beautiful product!!!</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance. So excited to find it at this price.</li>
    <li> The best perfume ever!!</li>
    <li> I was happy to find this for a much lower price online than in my local department store.

    <li> Favorite perfume at a fraction of the cost. Very happy!</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY!!! This must be a knock off product! This is not the real perfume. The scent is different (over powering) and does not last at all. I&#x27;m very disappointed. My second time not getting authentic products from Amazon!!!!! BUYERS BEWARE!</li>
    <li> Hanae Mori is the best fragrance. It is the first thing i put in my hand luggage when i travel. I have received so many great compliments and people can&#x27;t believe how inexpensive it is when they go on amazon. Love it.</li>
