      <li>but this is so much more effectivel.  </li>

      <li>Now I have very clean dental visits and healthy gums.</li>
      <li>It leaves your breath nice and clean.</li>
      <li>This is a great product and was highly recommended by my dental hygienist.  </li>
      <li>so I am glad that it is available online.  </li>
      <li>Not too strong and does the job</li>
      <li>And I really do use it more often!</li>
      <li>The price was right and the product is packaged very well, in a strong plastic container with a really good dispenser.</li>
      <li>And this is the most economical way to buy it.</li>
      <li>Over the years I have used many products and none leaves me with fresh taste and confidence of this product.  </li>
      <li>Be sure to SCRAPE your tongue first and brush.</li>
      <li>My 6-month dental cleanings have improved significantly using this, the BreathRx Toothpaste, the BreathRx Gum and their Tongue Scraper.</li>
      <li>It was originally recommended to me by a dentist.  </li>
      <li>makes your mouth feels clean.  </li>
      <li>Now I use this stuff before bed and things are much more reasonable in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I used BreathRX full strength as a mouth rinse and within a couple of days the pain was gone and has never returned.  </li>
      <li>It is also much more economical to get the gallon size, price wise because those smaller bottles will cost you more in the long run.  </li>
      <li>No stinging, no weird taste, just a quick and clean feeling</li>
      <li>I have suffered from moderate dry mouth ever since I was a teenager and dentists love to go on and on about how great Biotene is and that I should be using that.</li>
      <li>I hope this review is useful.</li>
      <li>This prevents people from coming into the bathroom and taking a swig out of the bottles either from the top or from the bottle directly.</li>
      <li>A BIT PRICEY - - WELL WORTH THE COST...</li>
      <li>It leaves my mouth feeling fresh throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be</li>
      <li>I started using it as a mouthwash, but then I tried using one pump&#x27;s worth in my water pick.  </li>
      <li>The dispenser is great so no more spill.</li>
      <li>BreathRx, you&#x27;re left with a powerful clean that sticks around.</li>
      <li>recommend it especially if you don&#x27;t like strong smelling products.</li>
      <li>Before switching to BreathRx, my mouth in the morning could have probably been legally declared a superfund cleanup site.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this mouthwash !</li>
      <li>I really like the idea of having a pump.  </li>
      <li>Way more convenient to push down on a plunger than uncap and recap a bottle.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Awhile back I tried another similar product (at a much lower cost) and started seeing plaque build-up very quickly.  </li>
      <li>However, the rest of us need to be vigilant with our oral care not only because bad hygiene will offend others but also because one would think good oral hygiene would just go along with good health in total.  </li>
      <li>Keeps your mouth feeling fresh more than any other mouthwash I have tried, and does not taste like a mixture of bleach and acid (i.e. all other mouthwashes I have ever tried).</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave your mouth feeling, for lack of a better word, lubed up like Biotene does, and the sharp minty flavor actually stimulates salivation.</li>
      <li>You have to use it frequently, and I never cared for the flavor or aftertaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I knew this because I couldn&#x27;t wear my night guard which was near that area.  </li>
      <li>it is huge and I store it under my sink typically and just refill a smaller dispenser bottle</li>
      <li>, I had initially intended to simply refill a smaller container and use that, however I found that the included pump dispenses the EXACT amount I like to use when mouth rinsing.</li>
      <li>I do not get general complaints from others about my mouth odors</li>
      <li>My dentist stated the product had a type of fluoride that can stain teeth an a few rare individuals.</li>
      <li>version, and the pump allows for better usage and less waste.</li>
      <li>Where I am currently living, the personnel who work in stores like BB&amp;B are not very helpful, so I don&#x27;t hold out much hope I will find out why the store doesn&#x27;t carry this product anymore.  </li>
      <li>Along with flossing and Gel picks, my gingivitis (with multiple 4mm and 5mm pockets) was completely healed using this product daily.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s relatively more expensive, but it&#x27;s the only product that really works and holds for a long time.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this product for a few years now, mouthwash keeps your mouth fresh without leaving it dry.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I buy this product by the gallon and can usually get it for about $47 including shipping.  I pour it in to smaller bottles and keep in in the car, my office and at home.  I started flossingon a daily or multi-daily basis, a few years ago and was amazed at how often I hit a pocket of foul-tasting material, probably bacteria, between a couple teeth.  I do not get general complaints from others about my mouth odors but sometimes I notice it in others and it is deplorable.  Some people suffer from bad breath as a result of medical issues and they should get help from a doctor.  However, the rest of us need to be vigilant with our oral care not only because bad hygiene will offend others but also because one would think good oral hygiene would just go along with good health in total.  This product is made without alcohol and that is good for many reasons.  Over the years I have used many products and none leaves me with fresh taste and confidence of this product.  They also sell tongue scrapers and gum for your pocket and I recommend those as well.  You can get small quantities of this product at Walgreens&#x27;.  Great Stuff!  Kevin</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a year and love it. It leaves your breath nice and clean. No after taste.When I saw this big one I had to buy it since the smaller size is not cheap. I would reccommend this product. I use it in my water pic then dilute it with a little water.</li>
    <li> Hands-down, this is the best mouthwash on the market. It has everything you need, minus the alcohol that makes some of the name-brands annoying. If you get the burning sensation from Listerine, etc., then you need to switch to BreathRx. It&#x27;s healthier for you anyways, and doesn&#x27;t dehydrate your mouth.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years along with Tooth &amp; Gum Tonic.  Both are great for dental health.</li>
    <li> This mouthwash does the job despite the fact that it is pricey. My mouth and teeth feel real clean after rinsing with it and I hope that my dentist sees an improvement in my oral health on my next visit.</li>
    <li> Been using for over a year and my dental check-ups have improved.</li>
    <li> love this mouth wash.  makes your mouth feels clean.  like the smell of my mouth after the rinse.  recommend it especially if you don&#x27;t like strong smelling products.</li>
    <li> I have suffered from moderate dry mouth ever since I was a teenager and dentists love to go on and on about how great Biotene is and that I should be using that. Well, I did use it for years, and it works wonderfully for maybe an hour, but after that, or if you drink or eat anything, you&#x27;re back to square one. You have to use it frequently, and I never cared for the flavor or aftertaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With BreathRx, you&#x27;re left with a powerful clean that sticks around. It doesn&#x27;t leave your mouth feeling, for lack of a better word, lubed up like Biotene does, and the sharp minty flavor actually stimulates salivation. The zinc ions present keep bad breath at bay for hours. Before switching to BreathRx, my mouth in the morning could have probably been legally declared a superfund cleanup site. Now I use this stuff before bed and things are much more reasonable in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very glad I found this mouth wash and I plan to stick with this for as long as they keep making it. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone, but especially to individuals who suffer from dry mouth and find Biotene to be unsatisfactory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other thing specific to this 1-gallon size, I had initially intended to simply refill a smaller container and use that, however I found that the included pump dispenses the EXACT amount I like to use when mouth rinsing. I&#x27;d suggest giving it a try before simply refilling a smaller container, you might just decide to stick with the pump.</li>
    <li> Why would you ever buy 1 gallon of mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;1)Because your dentist says they recommend this over other brands&lt;br /&gt;and&lt;br /&gt;2)Because it is just great tasting and worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;It works.</li>
    <li> Great price and it will last me a while. I bought a fancy decanter to put it out on my vanity and keep the jug put away.</li>
    <li> AS I&#x27;VE SAID IN PREVIOUS REMARKS - - BREATHRX IS BY FAR THE BEST LINE OF PRODUCTS ON THE MARKET TODAY.  ALTHOUGH A BIT PRICEY - - WELL WORTH THE COST... &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I am a dental hygienist, and I love this stuff. Alcohol free, tastes great, works like a charm. I keep a shotglass by the pump and take a two-pump hit twice a day. Highly recommend. And this is the most economical way to buy it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gotten better results with this product than the any &#x27;over-the-counter&#x27; mouthwash products. I truly appreciate the Anti-bacterial factor. I had bought the smaller bottles, but this big &#x27;jug&#x27; costs less and I have room on my counter for it. Way more convenient to push down on a plunger than uncap and recap a bottle. My 6-month dental cleanings have improved significantly using this, the BreathRx Toothpaste, the BreathRx Gum and their Tongue Scraper. You can even add this to a Water Pik..., a great plus. BreathRx just has really good products. I don&#x27;t mind paying a little extra for healthier teeth.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and was highly recommended by my dental hygienist.  The price was right and the product is packaged very well, in a strong plastic container with a really good dispenser.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because the product was recommended by my oral hygienist, and this size was, by far, the best value!</li>
    <li> I really like the idea of having a pump.  This prevents people from coming into the bathroom and taking a swig out of the bottles either from the top or from the bottle directly.</li>
    <li> No stinging, no weird taste, just a quick and clean feeling</li>
    <li> In 2007 I was told I needed a costly \\&quot;root planing and scaling\\&quot; procedure (which cost around $2K) which I couldn&#x27;t afford.  I got a WaterPik instead and started using it with some of this mouth rinse in the water.  Every night I starting doing this after brushing with the BreathRX toothpaste.  in 2010 I had a toothache and the dentist wanted to do a root canal.  I was leaving that day to go on a trip and didn&#x27;t have time to do the procedure.  I used BreathRX full strength as a mouth rinse and within a couple of days the pain was gone and has never returned.  So again I saved over a thousand dollars in unnecessary dental work.  I am disappointed that Bed Bath and Beyond doesn&#x27;t carry this line of products anymore (as of two months ago).  Where I am currently living, the personnel who work in stores like BB&amp;B are not very helpful, so I don&#x27;t hold out much hope I will find out why the store doesn&#x27;t carry this product anymore.  I will purchase it here online if I can&#x27;t buy it locally anymore.</li>
    <li> This stuff works better than any other mouth wash in preventing and treating bad breath that my family and I have used.</li>
    <li> This mouthwash is great. I had used Crest ProHealth mouthwash and it stained my teeth brown. My dentist stated the product had a type of fluoride that can stain teeth an a few rare individuals. BreathRx mouthwash does not stain my teeth or burn my mouth during use. It leaves my mouth feeling fresh throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be warned, however, the 16 oz bottle has a cap that has a design flaw. It leaks around the edge. You can not place the 16 oz bottle in a travel bag and expect it to not leak everywhere. You can not expect to have the 16 oz bottle and have it not leak around the cap even if sitting on your bathroom counter. I decided to buy the 1 gallon bottle and simply fill a separately purchased bottle that has a proper cap. I hope this review is useful.</li>
    <li> I use this every day if I am working or going out when I want cleaner breath longer. It works better than any others I&#x27;ve tried and works the longest. Be sure to SCRAPE your tongue first and brush. I also don&#x27;t rinse it out just spit. it is huge and I store it under my sink typically and just refill a smaller dispenser bottle</li>
    <li> You seldom see this mouthwash in the stores now so I am glad that it is available online.  It is also much more economical to get the gallon size, price wise because those smaller bottles will cost you more in the long run.  The dispenser is great so no more spill.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since 2002. It has a great flavor, no alcohol burn, and prevents bad breath and other oral hygiene problems for quite a while after use. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful! Makes my mouth tingle without the alcohol and the burning sensation .  I highly recommend this mouthwash !</li>
    <li> I realized I wasn&#x27;t using mouth wash because of the hassle. Saw the pump at my Dentists office and searched around. Only found it online. And I really do use it more often! I also put a paper cup dispenser on the wall...They get thrown out as needed...</li>
    <li> I have one tooth with this disease and dentist gave me a rinse to use with a syringe before bed to irrigate the gum.  It wasn&#x27;t working. I knew this because I couldn&#x27;t wear my night guard which was near that area.  I tried this and now the area is much better.  I started using it as a mouthwash, but then I tried using one pump&#x27;s worth in my water pick.  It foams up the water and irrigates the entire mouth this way.  I don&#x27;t have a problem anymore wearing the guard.  I&#x27;m so glad I found this product and read the reviews.  I was paying the dentist $15 for a small bottle of her product but this is so much more effectivel.  Try it and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  While others found it terrific as a mouthwash for bad breath, my issue was with one tooth&#x27;s gumline and because of this product&#x27;s antibacterial properties, it did the trick in a very short time.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for years.  Great for fresh breath and gingivitis.  Along with flossing and Gel picks, my gingivitis (with multiple 4mm and 5mm pockets) was completely healed using this product daily.  Now I have very clean dental visits and healthy gums. Awhile back I tried another similar product (at a much lower cost) and started seeing plaque build-up very quickly.  So I went back to BreathRx immediately after a dental cleaning and never tried anything else.  In fact, when I relocated out of the country on business for three years, I emptied a number of neighborhood store&#x27;s inventory, to bring this product along.  This gallon size gives you the best price and I use it to refill smaller bottles for daily use.</li>
    <li> Best mouthwash I&#x27;ve used.  I&#x27;ve been using this product off and on for years.  You can&#x27;t find it in the stores.  It was originally recommended to me by a dentist.  It lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Fantastic mouth-wash, and great price (compared to retail). Keeps your mouth feeling fresh more than any other mouthwash I have tried, and does not taste like a mixture of bleach and acid (i.e. all other mouthwashes I have ever tried).</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few years now, mouthwash keeps your mouth fresh without leaving it dry. product arrived on time as advertised.</li>
    <li> Great product at a fantastic price with lightening fast shipping!!  Great seller!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> this is a good mouthwash to have for kids who don&#x27;t like the burning alcohol feeling. this bottle will last a very long time before i have to purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is the best mouth rinse ever. Not too strong and does the job</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why this is not sold alongside the more popular and known brands in retail stores, so I have to resort buying it here.  It&#x27;s relatively more expensive, but it&#x27;s the only product that really works and holds for a long time.  Glad to see they have this 128 oz. version, and the pump allows for better usage and less waste.</li>
