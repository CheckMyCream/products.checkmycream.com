      <li>LOVE!</li>
      <li>These hair towels are amazing.</li>
      <li>works amazing for hair</li>
      <li>Nice hair towel for the price.  </li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t own a microfiber hair towel, you need to get one.  </li>
      <li>This is a good price based on my research &amp; the quality is top notch.  </li>
      <li>The microfiber texture is like the kind they make for drying cars.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve had a lot of experience with this kind of product.</li>
      <li>This frees me from having a sopping cotton towel after every shower, though, which is nice.  </li>
      <li>I use it for plopping my curls instead of old t-shirts; it&#x27;s the perfect size and looks better!  </li>
      <li>Enter the Diva Dryer, it is a great size and super absorbent.</li>
      <li>Love love these towels!</li>
      <li>LOVE them both, though, and wish they came in more colors - some bright ones, too :-)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used a couple off brands and they don&#x27;t work as well, this brand is by far the best</li>
      <li>I wish it had some kind of elastic around the edges to keep it on my head better.</li>
      <li>it sounds too good to be true</li>
      <li>did i mention i love this thing?????</li>
      <li>I bought it as a gift, and was expecting it to come in a cute cylinder like the one pictured.</li>
      <li>I really like this however the ideal hair towel would be a bit larger since this one dosnt fit by head perfectly.</li>
      <li>I took one star off because I think it could use two more inches in width...</li>
      <li>&#x3D;)  </li>
      <li>So much better than a bulky towel...</li>
      <li>The towel leaves a lot of the moisture in your hair so the products you use work better.</li>
      <li>I already have had this for more than 6 months, and I love it.  </li>
      <li>It absorbs more water than a terry cloth towel and stops my curly hair getting that &#x27;frizz&#x27; from a terry cloth towel.  </li>
      <li>I should have bought a couple more.  </li>
      <li>This is more of that plush or fuzzy microfiber.</li>
      <li>The item may be OK</li>
      <li>I am ordering more.  </li>
      <li>The fibers are just so much better for it.</li>
      <li>I am so glad I took the time to research these towels on Amazon.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I bought this because it also claims to soak up more water when you are finished washing your hair.</li>
      <li>i love these towels</li>
      <li>but if you gather your hair on top of your head, wrap this towel around it and clip or tie it to secure it  </li>
      <li>i save the most and got free shipping</li>
      <li>and I can tell it will be a great addition to my natural hair necessities.</li>
      <li>Not the original Aquis fabric that I love.</li>
      <li>Plus it dries out very quickly hanging it over the towel bar.  </li>
      <li>I will admit that I caved in to too many blogs and youtube videos about plopping and drying hair w/ a special towel.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t dry my hair quite as good as the original but does ok and feels nice.</li>
      <li>I have fine frizzy/curly hair.  </li>
      <li>you can really wrap yourself up in, but it sure will save on space in the washer and dryer!  </li>
      <li>I do love this towel - very lightweight, dries quickly on its own, etc.  </li>
      <li>These thirsty microfiber towels are wonderful... however do NOT get anything other than the Mimi&#x27;s Diva Dryer!!  </li>
      <li>enjoy girls</li>
      <li>It is definitely not big and bulky but does a great job soaking up water.</li>
      <li>perfect little towel, protects hair!</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t affect how useful this towel is - it just looks like it needs to be washed!  </li>
      <li>Perfect for plopping (but don&#x27;t leave on as long as ppl do for t-shirts, it sucks the water out FAST) and perfect for towel drying before adding products for a blow</li>
      <li>She uses it for her hair right after a shower and loves it!</li>
      <li>Just the right size and SUPER absorbent!  </li>
      <li>True, it&#x27;s not a towel</li>
      <li>Like that it dries quickly, though</li>
      <li>Works well and dries quickly after use.  </li>
      <li>to- absorbs water out of your hair quickly, efficiently, and with a minimum of frizz by-product.</li>
      <li>towel is large enough, very soft, gentle, easy to wash, and does the job perfectly.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It dries my hair more quickly than a normal towel</li>
      <li>We both liked them so much that we just ordered an extra one to rotate through. :)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I ordered this item because all the photos showed the hair turban with elastic so it stays on your head.  I received a towel.  The item may be OK but it is not what is shown in the pictures.</li>
    <li> Like others have noted, this is a fairly small towel so it can be hard to get it to stay wrapped around your head.  I have a big noggin and while I can get the towel wrapped, it&#x27;s touch-and-go as to whether it&#x27;ll stay on or spring open.  However, I don&#x27;t need it on for long because it soaks up all my hair&#x27;s excess water so quickly.  Recommended for curly hair, or any use where you want to dry quickly without rubbing.</li>
    <li> This towel is great - perfect size and highly absorbent.  I would recommend this towel to anyone who wants to lessen their &#x27;get ready&#x27; time in the morning.</li>
    <li> This is one great little towel -- coming out of the shower, I tie it around my hair turban style and then leave it there while I put on makeup, get dressed, etc.  When I take it off, my hair is dry enough to put my curl gel on and let it finish drying.  It is definitely not big and bulky but does a great job soaking up water.</li>
    <li> This towel works wonderfully.  Dries my hair faster than a regular towel and it is small enough to put up like a turban.  I was very pleased.</li>
    <li> This is a great hair towel and the perfect size.  I have medium length hair, past my shoulders, and I can wrap all my hair up easily in this towel.  It absorbs more water than a terry cloth towel and stops my curly hair getting that &#x27;frizz&#x27; from a terry cloth towel.  I wish I had bought it years ago!</li>
    <li> Dries my hair really well and helps me keep my curls. I wish it had some kind of elastic around the edges to keep it on my head better.</li>
    <li> This is great for minimizing frizz! The only reason I gave it 4/5 is due to its size. I have fine, curly, right-below the shoulder length hair and it BARELY wraps around my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your hair is course or thick and shoulder-length, save your money as it will probably be too small.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it was advertised as reducing blowdrying time.  Turns out to be one of those \\&quot;if it sounds too good to be true then it probably is\\&quot; products.  I have shoulder-length hair that is naturally wavy and takes about 15 minutes to blowdry straight after using a regular towel.  I used the Mimi&#x27;s towel and the blowdrying time was (drumroll, please...)15  minutes!  So it didn&#x27;t work for me.  On the positive side, it is very lightweight, so I could see how it would be useful if you typically make a turban out of your towel and walk around with it on your head.  In that case, it would be much lighter and more comfortable than a regular towel.</li>
    <li> perfect little towel, protects hair!</li>
    <li> This and the Aquis hair turban are the first microfiber towels I&#x27;ve tried.  I&#x27;m very impressed!  This 19 x 39 inch towel is way way way more than enough for toweling off after a shower. Plus it dries out very quickly hanging it over the towel bar.  True, it&#x27;s not a towel you can really wrap yourself up in, but it sure will save on space in the washer and dryer!  I will definitely be buying more Aquis towels.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000YZDF4O Mimi&#x27;s Diva Dryer by Aquis Microfiber Hair Towel, White (19 x 39-Inches)]]    i love these towels and i buy three at a time bc after awhile the need to be replaced just like bath towels...so with the three that i bought on here i save the most and got free shipping &#x3D;)  so that is why amazon is my FAV website. enjoy girls</li>
    <li> I do love this towel - very lightweight, dries quickly on its own, etc.  I use it for plopping my curls instead of old t-shirts; it&#x27;s the perfect size and looks better!  I can see a modest improvement in the reduction of frizz.  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.  The only reason I&#x27;m knocking off one star is because every time I was the towel, it picks up more and more random debris/sticks/fibers from other pieces of laundry.  In fact, I&#x27;ve only washed it a handful of times since purchasing and it&#x27;s literally covered with little fibers.  They don&#x27;t affect how useful this towel is - it just looks like it needs to be washed!  But, unfortunately, no amount of washing will take these out - I think I have to pull them all up by hand!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this three times now and still haven&#x27;t seen any significant difference from using a regular cotton terry towel.  I have long thick hair and purchased this microfiber towel to reduce the dry time but I&#x27;m disappointed.  Perhaps this works for people with less hair?</li>
    <li> Its Useful. Yes, I recomend it.</li>
    <li> I have long long hair, not super thick though.  It normally takes me about 20-30 minutes to dry my hair.  I used the towel this morning.  Had it on for about 30 minutes, took 10 minutes to dry my hair.  Happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> A little too small to be ideal unfortunately. If it were a bit bigger it would be more useful. But it is very adsorbent.</li>
    <li> I had no choice but to rate the towel 5 stars! Not only is it soft and gentle on my hair but it soaks up water instantly. I wrap my hair and leave the towel on for about 5 to 10 minutes while I do my make-up and when I take my towel off my hair is smooth and so much more tangle free than when I use a regular towel. I love that it is not heavy and bulky as well. I will never use any other towel on my hair again. Thank you Mimi&#x27;s Diva Dryer my wavy curls love your stuff!!!</li>
    <li> When you want to get your hair dried faster but you don&#x27;t want the damage of heat, this towels is a great way to kick start the process.</li>
    <li> Not much different than my dish towels. Like that it dries quickly, though</li>
    <li> I have long, naturally curly hair that is beautiful with the right products but a frizzy bush otherwise.  I bought this towel because it&#x27;s supposed to be excellent for curly hair.  After shampoo, I wrap my hair (no squeezing, rubbing, etc)until I&#x27;m ready for products.  If I take too long I find that too much moisture is gone and here comes that frizz.  So, I like it but like everything else in life, you have to manage it...geesh!</li>
    <li> These hair towels are amazing. When your hair is wrapped in one for 10-15 minutes, your hair is very close to dry. Good for us air-dry people.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t own a microfiber hair towel, you need to get one.  Using these towels cut down on my hair dryer time significantly.  If I&#x27;m traveling and forget to bring one and use a normal towel my hair takes forever to dry.</li>
    <li> Really great for curly hair- It helped to keep my curls and not frizz them up. I took off a star because the first one smelled moldy after about 6 months.</li>
    <li> I was hoping that this towel would reduce the amount of time required to air dry my hair.  I don&#x27;t use a blow dryer and I hate going out in the winter with wet hair.  I was disappointed to find that this towel did not really seem to soak up water any more quickly than a regular bath towel.  I&#x27;ll  keep it and continue to use it to wrap my hair in, but it was not the miracle solution I was hoping for.</li>
    <li> I got this for my Mom and she loves it, it helps hair to dry quickly, it is soft and easy to use. After hearing her praise I think I will get one for myself as well!</li>
    <li> Stop using regular towels on your hair immediately if you have any issues with frizz! STOP NOW AND BUY THIS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have wavy/slightly curly hair that isn&#x27;t horribly frizzy normally but can get a little bad. This has immediately improved my hair. The fibers are just so much better for it. This size is fairly small but should be big enough as long as you don&#x27;t have really long hair. I don&#x27;t do the regular wrapping that I did with bigger towels but if you gather your hair on top of your head, wrap this towel around it and clip or tie it to secure it  (I use a hair tie), the size is perfect.</li>
    <li> I recently decided to stop with perms go Natural [google that for those who dont know what that means].. This towel works GREAT with my transitioning hair. I couldn&#x27;t do the BC [big chop] but majority of the perm is gone and I can tell it will be a great addition to my natural hair necessities. After the first use I can tell the difference in how my hair felt compared to drying it with any ole regular towel.</li>
    <li> I would recommend the towel, it dries really well, much better than normal bath towel, however when you twist it up into a turban it doesn&#x27;t stay...perhaps I should buy one of the turban ones.</li>
    <li> Will be ordering another just to keep in my travel kit.  This towel is so light weight and comfortable... and dries my very thick hair so much better than a terry towel.  LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve had a lot of experience with this kind of product. I have 3A/B curly hair. It&#x27;s winter, and my hair has been dry. Have been using this instead of a regular towel and it&#x27;s seemed to make a big difference in how my hair turns out. The towel leaves a lot of the moisture in your hair so the products you use work better. Again, I haven&#x27;t had experience with other towels of this type, but I imagine that they are all similar. I did have a good experience with this product, and would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> This is soft and big enough.  I didn&#x27;t know what to expect, but when I really try to get the water from my hair it works well.  It takes less time to dry.  My hair is short, but I think it would work much better for long hair because you can wring it dry.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed for my money. I yhought I was getting a turban but I got this thin towel and it isn&#x27;t drying my hair any faster thn using a big bath towel on my head. This is less heavy though.</li>
    <li> So it&#x27;s a time saver and a hairdrying-damage-reducer.  I had a plain terry wrap before, purchased from Marshall&#x27;s, that had a button on a corner so it would stay in place - this company should add that to this microfiber wrap and it would be perfect.  Even so, I just wrap my hair and tuck the corner under (those with thicker hair could use a clip). The fabric here is made of high quality tiny suckers. Durable, so I know it will last awhile too. Great purchase. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have fine frizzy/curly hair.  I&#x27;ve used this at least a dozen times by now, and have not seen any difference in my hair than when I use a normal towel.</li>
    <li> The microfiber works well to dry hair, and the towel dries quickly.  It&#x27;s a little bit too short, and a little wider than necessary, so that wearing it turban-style is difficult.  This frees me from having a sopping cotton towel after every shower, though, which is nice.  If you have a large noggin, I&#x27;d advise finding a slightly larger towel.</li>
    <li> this item is useless.  it is too small for long hair--if i had short hair i wouldn&#x27;t need help drying it!  it is so small that it cannot be wrapped around so that the ends are up and stop dripping.  Waste of money...</li>
    <li> Good quality &amp; price, works well.</li>
    <li> Not as large as I had hoped. Not much better than a Turbie Twist and I can get those for $4 at a local big Box Store. It works, but it isn&#x27;t worth the money</li>
    <li> Works really well with my curly hair. Its Just a larger micro fiber towel.</li>
    <li> my curls love this thing! it came right on time thanks to prime shipping and it came as described. it did smell a little funny when i first took it out of the package but that went away when i washed it. did i mention i love this thing????? my hair is waaay less frizzy than when i use a regular towel. ill be buying another one for me and gifting them for friends and family. good buy!</li>
    <li> I will admit that I caved in to too many blogs and youtube videos about plopping and drying hair w/ a special towel. Thought it was silly and felt silly ordering.  Not anymore. Perfect for plopping (but don&#x27;t leave on as long as ppl do for t-shirts, it sucks the water out FAST) and perfect for towel drying before adding products for a blow out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I wash and condition I very gently wrap hair in this towel while I apply my face and body moisturizers. Once I&#x27;m done I take my towel off and my hair is towel dried enough to spray on leave-in conditioner and add styling cream. It has aided my attempts to blow dry my very curly unrelaxed 3c/4a smooth.</li>
    <li> This is a very large hair towel and it works very well to absorb water after hair washing. Remember to wash without using fabric softener.</li>
    <li> Works well and dries quickly after use.  It is rectangular, so it will cover long hair if you put it on your head at a bit of an angle.</li>
    <li> Nice hair towel for the price.  Good absorbency.</li>
    <li> I purchased two of these and since they were gifts I haven&#x27;t personally used them.  I understand they are really great!</li>
    <li> works amazing for hair</li>
    <li> So much better than a bulky towel...love it!  I took one star off because I think it could use two more inches in width...I have a short bob and the 19\\&quot; barely covers it.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to friends with longer hair....especially past shoulder length.</li>
    <li> I like using a plain white men&#x27;s t-shirt much better.  $13 for a 7 pack of t shirts instead of $10 for this horrible towel.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the same aquis towel for my hair for over 10 years. This one is a little different than the smooth, flat texture of mine. The microfiber texture is like the kind they make for drying cars. I bought it as a gift, and was expecting it to come in a cute cylinder like the one pictured. The one I received came folded flat in a plastic bag. It&#x27;s going to work ok, because I just decided to just pack it flat in a box. Kind of disappointed though.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST towel for your hair EVER!  Just the right size and SUPER absorbent!  No big bulky towel on your head, and it cuts your drying time!  I&#x27;ve had one for years and was so thankful that I was able to find it again to have a backup!  I take this with me every time I travel!</li>
    <li> I bought the other two Aquis hair towels (Waffle &amp; Lisse Crepe) - this type, Mimi&#x27;s, although the cheapest of the three, is actually the softest - I really love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This towel is large enough, very soft, gentle, easy to wash, and does the job perfectly. As my hair is dry, a soft hair towel is something I can appreciate. Not only it is much softer than cotton towels, I also find that it does reasonably help with drying time (although don&#x27;t expect miracles...).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SMELL:&lt;br /&gt;A couple of reviews mentioned the chemical smell - luckily, mine arrived with a very mild smell (I am quite sensitive to smells so was a little concerned) - but so did the other Aquis towels. Perhaps it is a matter of luck.&lt;br /&gt;I do find that adding some Eucalyptus oil to the washing (during the rinse cycle) helps to get rid of smells - so my towels smell fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHITE/PINK:&lt;br /&gt;The white towel is designed a little differently to the pink one.&lt;br /&gt;The pink one seems slightly thicker, but it has that odd white edge. It would have looked nicer without the white &#x27;addition&#x27;. The white one is just that - white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE them both, though, and wish they came in more colors - some bright ones, too :-)</li>
    <li> Helped dry my long curly hair faster then a regular towel.  It&#x27;s a good size for just drying your hair.  I wouldn&#x27;t use to it dry my whole body as I prefer a bigger towel for that.</li>
    <li> Not exactly what I expected. Not the original Aquis fabric that I love. This is more of that plush or fuzzy microfiber. Doesn&#x27;t dry my hair quite as good as the original but does ok and feels nice.</li>
    <li> I really like this, it doesn&#x27;t dry my hair completely, but it takes a good majority of the moisture out to make it easier to blow dry.</li>
    <li> Works good to absorb all excess water! Definitely a good buy! I use it every day!</li>
    <li> This is a large microfiber towel, much larger than the Devacurl equivalent product (or at least one I got in a kit). It does what it&#x27;s supposed to- absorbs water out of your hair quickly, efficiently, and with a minimum of frizz by-product. Love it!</li>
    <li> These thirsty microfiber towels are wonderful... however do NOT get anything other than the Mimi&#x27;s Diva Dryer!!  Imitations are horrible, especially those that are not a rectangle towel.  Don&#x27;t be fooled by the ones with elastic &amp; a button so that you don&#x27;t have to wrap it yourself - no, no, no.  You must stick with Mimi&#x27;s Diva Dryer by Aquis.  I&#x27;ve had one for 5 years and needed a travel one.  LOVE!</li>
    <li> I love this towel for my naturally curly hair. It is just the right size. Cuts down on frizz. Works great.</li>
    <li> This is the second one for my wife after using her first one for several years.  She uses it for her hair right after a shower and loves it!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a recommendation to help keep my curly hair&#x27;s frizz down. It does it&#x27;s job...it&#x27;s super-absorbent, so it sucks all the water out of my hair, but any product I put in my hair thereafter dries stiffly as a result. It works great for drying my dog off and soaking up messes, but I don&#x27;t use it on my hair anymore.</li>
    <li> Love love these towels! I have naturally curly hair and like most with curly hair it&#x27;s hard to tame! Watching countless YouTube videos and reading blogs on ideas to control the frizz I came across this. I have purchased three over the past year and a half. I wrap my hair straight from the shower in these. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair frizzy like towels and does a good job of getting all the access water out of my hair. Makes it easier to put mousse in my hair and go. I&#x27;ve used a couple off brands and they don&#x27;t work as well, this brand is by far the best</li>
    <li> I really like this however the ideal hair towel would be a bit larger since this one dosnt fit by head perfectly.</li>
    <li> I had been reading about different towels to use for natural hair. Of course, cotton towels are not the favorite because they can cause breakage and is rough on the hair. I bought this because it also claims to soak up more water when you are finished washing your hair. It does! My hair constantly dripped with water much more before I started using this towel. I am one of those people who hates water dripping down the face after I wash my hair. I can deal with damp, not soaking. This towel has reduced the length my hair is soaking wet. It is not rough at all and I recommend this towel to naturals and whoever would like their hair to dry faster faster.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not long enough. It doesn&#x27;t dry as well as other towels that I&#x27;ve tried. That&#x27;s it. It&#x27;s very difficult to find a better option, though, so this will need to do for now.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice absorbent towel. I wish it was wider though, I can&#x27;t wrap it around turban style and tuck it in but I manage to keep it on.  My hair is thick but not very long, it doesn&#x27;t even reach my mid back so they really need to make it wider. The towel is very absorbent, it really sucks all the water out of your hair so if you have dry curly hair that frizzes up quickly like me, you might have to not leave it on so long. I have styling products that need to be put on with damp hair. When I leave this towel on to long my hair has gotten to dry and frizzy on the ends and I have to wet it again with spray conditioner.  The towel dries quickly over night for use the next day and I like that I am no longer wrapping my hair in our large towels.</li>
    <li> Bought 10 for gifts everyone loves them.</li>
    <li> An excellent and fairly priced product.  I should have bought a couple more.  Anything smaller would be useless for use on hair.</li>
    <li> This towel was recommended by a few different websites for curly hair. It absorbs the water, and I don&#x27;t have to spend half the time I did with heated styling tools.</li>
    <li> I bought this towel because I wanted to try something new for my curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It dries my hair more quickly than a normal towel and it doesn&#x27;t pull on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it and recommend it for everyone!</li>
    <li> Best towel for curly hair ever.  I use this every day and couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.  It does the job perfectly.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to help with my curly hair. I currently use the &amp;#34;plopping&amp;#34; method for about 2 hours after I shower. Previously I had been using a t-shirt, but wanted to try something that was made specifically for hair. I felt like the microfiber was too clingy to my hair and caused my curls to be much frizzier than usual. I tried it twice before ultimately shipping it back and going back to my t-shirt method. If you have curly hair, I really don&#x27;t recommend you try this product.</li>
    <li> Wavy - Curly hair here.  I already have had this for more than 6 months, and I love it.  After the shower, I keep my hair wrapped while I put my clothes on and apply makeup.  Then I add my styling product and ready to go!</li>
    <li> I have been looking everywhere for one of these.  It is really hard to find unless you want the turban style which I don&#x27;t like.  This is a good price based on my research &amp; the quality is top notch.  I am ordering more.  A regular towel is heavier than I like &amp; my stylist recommended using one of these to avoid breakage.  Love this product!</li>
    <li> Makes your hair frizz. Stay away from microfiber towels - stick with 100% cotton ladies!</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- I really like this towel. I am so glad I took the time to research these towels on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;- I had been using T Shirts because I only had one very small microfiber towel. Now I have 2 Diva girl towels.&lt;br /&gt;- This is wide enough for me to use each morning. I don&#x27;t a lot of hair. I no longer have chemically treated hair.&lt;br /&gt;- It absorbs very well.&lt;br /&gt;-  I have been using it for about a month. I have washed it a few times with no issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;None at this time</li>
    <li> Works fine as a hair towel, but I don&#x27;t notice that my hair is any drier than when using a regular towel.</li>
    <li> After a couple of years of use, this became moldy! This is very helpful though, for drying hair faster. I will order another, perhaps a different brand.</li>
    <li> I have thick, curly hair and so blow drying my hair isn&#x27;t really an option for my hair--it&#x27;s too slow with a diffuser and if I use it on the regular setting I end up with a giant puffball. I hate going through half of my day with damp hair. Enter the Diva Dryer, it is a great size and super absorbent. It soaks up all of the excess water quickly and is the perfect size for wrapping turban style around my head while I brush my teeth and get dressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up with this brand because a girlfriend picked up an extra for me. She did a ton of research before she bought and found that it was the best quality and size for the price. We both liked them so much that we just ordered an extra one to rotate through. :)</li>
    <li> I bought this to use on my curly hair to avoid frizz.  It is a nice big size.  THe weave is rougher than the Deva Curl microfiber towel I bought.</li>
