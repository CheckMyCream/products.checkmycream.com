      <li>Perfect for fall and just really well done.</li>
      <li>I heard so many good things about this fragrance.</li>
      <li>It smells nice.</li>
      <li>One of the things that makes it so great is that it has the heart of A* Men, but does away with the overbearing tar notes and introduces a creamy and sweet opening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The cost from this website was the best price I&#x27;ve paid for it thus far.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s sweet, masculine, and perfect for Fall or Winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many flankers in the Thierry Mugler Angel Men line-up, however, of all the fragrances I own in the Mugler lineup (trust me, I own all the flankers) -</li>
      <li>then it settles to the heart the tobacco is still there however not as prominent, (</li>
      <li>This Eau de Toilette is designed to make sure you won&#x27;t stink even when you sweat, and if it doesn&#x27;t succeed, face it, you&#x27;re a bum.</li>
      <li>I get so many compliments when I wear it.</li>
      <li>I love the cherry and the pipe smell (</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad they still make it.</li>
      <li>One of my top five fragrances.  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite</li>
      <li>i love it</li>
      <li>I am glad it is not discontinued.</li>
      <li>it is my  favorite colon and as i was expecting it to be thank you</li>
      <li>and i would buy some more when it is finished</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not a tobacco cigarette smell, it&#x27;s more like a tobacco leaf).</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I compare this more to JPG than anything else I&#x27;ve smelled.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a youthful scent for sure.  </li>
      <li>but I love it.</li>
      <li>This is currently my favorite cologne.</li>
      <li>well you get Avery thing right good</li>
      <li>/&gt;this fragrance projects and leaves a good scent trail for the first 4-5 hrs of the life of this fragrance.</li>
      <li>During the dry-down, the tongka bean and honey become more prominent which creates a masculine and delicious concoction of scents that is very pleasing to one&#x27;s senses.&lt;br</li>
      <li>it is not as strong as the original A men by thierry mugler but very strong regardless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Does have a hint of the A men thing going on but a different beast entirely in a very good way.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll make sure he ALWAYS has a fresh bottle of this on the shelf!</li>
      <li>you dont like strong smelling fragrance</li>
      <li>Medicinal cherry, cool snuff - sweet, light chocolate and a nice vanilla is what I get from it.</li>
      <li>Hands down the best  smelling cologne that I have ever owned.</li>
      <li>Great Scent, lasts a long time and its authentic</li>
      <li>Angel Men Pure Havane is my most favorite.</li>
      <li>Much more milder than Pure Malt and more versitle.</li>
      <li>Huge fan of Mugler but</li>
      <li>Ordered from beauty encounter- genuine article with code under box lid.</li>
      <li>top notes: fresh tobacco leaves</li>
      <li>Definitely worth every penny!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s such a warm and sexy scent</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s different and pleasant.</li>
      <li>I also have Pure Wood and LOVE that scent to death.  </li>
      <li>I feel that Pure Havane is more of a &amp;#34;clubby&amp;#34; scent.  </li>
      <li>dont like sweet fragrance</li>
      <li>It opens sweet.</li>
      <li>but it is not bad</li>
      <li>However...I don&#x27;t like how sweet and powerful it is.  </li>
      <li>if you have smelled the original A men then you will know exactly what i am talking about</li>
      <li>Honey and fresh rolled cigars.</li>
      <li>I have over 40 bottles of cologne and this is by far my favorite.  </li>
      <li>Someone who definitely wants you to smell him right when you approach.  </li>
      <li>The smell  has a note of tobacco at first glance, but after minutes, the tobacco gets less strong and the classic Angel Men comes more pronounced.</li>
      <li>Usually I buy the Angel Men blue one, but this one is very good.</li>
      <li>this can get very overpowering and clawing if you wear it in the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really like the way this EDT smells.  </li>
      <li>my girlfriend loves it..smells very sweet..almost like honey.</li>
      <li>Absolutely wonderfull...</li>
      <li>I will order again very soon.</li>
      <li>Classic.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also when applying, be careful on how much you apply because people will smell you !!!</li>
      <li>and no, I don&#x27;t mean that kind of pipe).</li>
      <li>i found this limited offer cologne in the local mall, they wanted about $15-20 more than what i found it for on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I live in buffalo.</li>
      <li>Just like the cigar, the first third of the fragrance opens with an aromatic note, without revealing anything of the intensity that is to come.</li>
      <li>Pure Havana, has three lives, on the 1st initial spray you get tobacco, cherry for about 1 hour on my skin</li>
      <li>Reminds me of being around people who still smoked pipe tobacco when I was young.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t get the old man smell.</li>
      <li>This scent drives my woman wild.</li>
      <li>wow</li>
      <li>Tobacco note is still there though with a patchouli cocoa note really shining through later on...</li>
      <li>I love the soft smell and a little goes a long way.</li>
      <li>I like more subtle.  </li>
      <li>but I personally do not out as his older brothers, is steps below.</li>
      <li>I get this very sweet honey cigar feeling with some cherries in the beginning of this fragrance and then going to dry down</li>
      <li>This fragrance is like no other that I&#x27;ve smelled.</li>

    <li> My aphrodisiac. This scent drives my woman wild. It&#x27;s sweet, masculine, and perfect for Fall or Winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many flankers in the Thierry Mugler Angel Men line-up, however, of all the fragrances I own in the Mugler lineup (trust me, I own all the flankers) - Angel Men Pure Havane is my most favorite. One of the things that makes it so great is that it has the heart of A* Men, but does away with the overbearing tar notes and introduces a creamy and sweet opening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The opening begins with a blast of cured tobacco, honey, and tongka bean. During the dry-down, the tongka bean and honey become more prominent which creates a masculine and delicious concoction of scents that is very pleasing to one&#x27;s senses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try this on, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Awesome Fragrance!!!...I wear this stuff everyday and it is definitely a head-turner as well as a crowd pleaser! Plus my girlfriend loves this stuff. A must have for any cologne enthusiast!!!</li>
    <li> I like the scent...and I&#x27;m a snob about smells.  However...I don&#x27;t like how sweet and powerful it is.  I like more subtle.  Of course, you may have way different tastes than I have.  I also have Pure Wood and LOVE that scent to death.  I feel that Pure Havane is more of a &amp;#34;clubby&amp;#34; scent.  Someone who definitely wants you to smell him right when you approach.  It&#x27;s a youthful scent for sure.  someone else posted that it&#x27;s an &amp;#34;old man&amp;#34; scent, but there&#x27;s no way.  I compare this more to JPG than anything else I&#x27;ve smelled.  Huge fan of Mugler but this one is a bit &amp;#34;youthful&amp;#34; for me.</li>
    <li> Great Scent, lasts a long time and its authentic</li>
    <li> When I wear this, I smell great!</li>
    <li> This fragrance is like no other that I&#x27;ve smelled. Pure Havana, has three lives, on the 1st initial spray you get tobacco, cherry for about 1 hour on my skin then it settles to the heart the tobacco is still there however not as prominent, (it&#x27;s not a tobacco cigarette smell, it&#x27;s more like a tobacco leaf). The dry down is cocoa powderish and vanilla. This can be worn on different occasion Imo, work, school, date, lounge, bar.&lt;br /&gt;My rating&lt;br /&gt;Logivity: B- (5 to 8 hours)&lt;br /&gt;Projection: B+ (when you leave the room your scent is still there)&lt;br /&gt;Scent: A&lt;br /&gt;Diversity: A&lt;br /&gt;Overall: A</li>
    <li> It smells nice. Not the punch to the face as a man. It opens sweet. The. As it drys it gets heavier. I was at a department stor and asked random girls there thoughts on a few scents and they picked this one EVERY time. It&#x27;s just different they said. It&#x27;s probobly the honey.  I don&#x27;t get the old man smell. It smells fancy but smoth. Def a winter scent. I live in buffalo. I know winter. I like it. It&#x27;s different and pleasant.</li>
    <li> Smells great, and not at all overpowering.  The smell changes over time and lasts for an entire day.  Very subtle and professional.  I&#x27;ve had no complaints from women.</li>
    <li> On the box it says, and I quote: &amp;#34;Discover the tale of a fragrance inspired by the rule of two thirds used in the art of crafting Cigars. Just like the cigar, the first third of the fragrance opens with an aromatic note, without revealing anything of the intensity that is to come. The second third unfurls a honey-sweet tobacco note which leads to the woody power of the final third.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Like the men who deserve to wear this fragrance, it keeps its promise. This Eau de Toilette is designed to make sure you won&#x27;t stink even when you sweat, and if it doesn&#x27;t succeed, face it, you&#x27;re a bum. Get a bath!</li>
    <li> Ordered from beauty encounter- genuine article with code under box lid. I really like the way this EDT smells.  Reminds me of being around people who still smoked pipe tobacco when I was young.  The smell is not quite the same though as it is sweeter.  Tobacco note is still there though with a patchouli cocoa note really shining through later on...a great mix....lasts 8 hours or so on my skin</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not something so u can be like wow but it is not bad</li>
    <li> Came on time..smells great...my girlfriend loves it..smells very sweet..almost like honey. Has a hint of cigar and the Thierry muggler DNA...awesome stuff</li>
    <li> Absolutely wonderfull...&lt;br /&gt;A must buy..</li>
    <li> Great  smell love itv</li>
    <li> Good nice exellent bery good perfect very well Was all good  here is well you get Avery thing right good</li>
    <li> i would read other reviews to get into the specifics of this perfume but I love it. I have been using Angel for women for years. I tend to like mens scents and bought it for myself. I love it.</li>
    <li> Perfect for fall and just really well done. Does have a hint of the A men thing going on but a different beast entirely in a very good way.</li>
    <li> This parfume is very very good.I will order again very soon.</li>
    <li> Pleasant fragrance, but I personally do not out as his older brothers, is steps below. Medicinal cherry, cool snuff - sweet, light chocolate and a nice vanilla is what I get from it. What I can highlight as a positive point is its versatility, day - night, summer - winter casual - formal, among others ...</li>
    <li> Great winter fragrance with the nice tobacco and cherry smell and awesome longevity. The best Thiery Mugler in the line of Pure fragrances. Much more milder than Pure Malt and more versitle.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful. Husband and son loves it.</li>
    <li> i found this limited offer cologne in the local mall, they wanted about $15-20 more than what i found it for on Amazon. i ordered it and shipped to my home within a week. the product was perfectly packaged with all paperwork...i love it and so does my girl when i wear it.</li>
    <li> Classic. This is my favorite and I&#x27;m glad they still make it.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance! I get so many compliments when I wear it. It reminds me of a Southern Gentlemen. Definitely worth every penny!</li>
    <li> top notes: fresh tobacco leaves&lt;br /&gt;middle notes: honeyed tobacco accord, vanilla notes&lt;br /&gt;base notes: patchouli, bitter cacao&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;with this fragrance I get this very sweet honey cigar feeling with some cherries in the beginning of this fragrance and then going to dry down, your going to get that thierry mugler signature patchouli dry down. if you have smelled the original A men then you will know exactly what i am talking about but if you havent i know there are some creams that have patchouli in them so try to smell that to have an idea what patchouli smells like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This fragrances last for 10+ hours on my skin and on your cloths you will have it on for days or even weeks, even after you wash your cloths. it is not as strong as the original A men by thierry mugler but very strong regardless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this fragrance projects and leaves a good scent trail for the first 4-5 hrs of the life of this fragrance. it then becomes close to the skin however it stays on your skin and will for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is classified as a semi-gourmand type of fragrance, therefore i recommend wearing this durring fall/winter season. this can get very overpowering and clawing if you wear it in the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;one tip before purchasing would be try before you buy(if you can find it)&lt;br /&gt;if you cant try before you buy then if you can spend the money and you want take a gamble then by all means.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also when applying, be careful on how much you apply because people will smell you !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;why would you not like this fragrance?&lt;br /&gt;if you dont like strong smelling fragrance&lt;br /&gt;you do not like the patchouli dry down&lt;br /&gt;you dont like sweet fragrance&lt;br /&gt;you dont like the tabacco accord</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t even begin to describe how delicious this stuff smells! It is absolutely amazing. The tobacco blends beautifully with the vanilla and honey - one of my favorites that my husband wears. It&#x27;s such a warm and sexy scent and I&#x27;m definitely addicted to it on his skin. I&#x27;ll make sure he ALWAYS has a fresh bottle of this on the shelf!</li>
    <li> it is my  favorite colon and as i was expecting it to be thank you and i would buy some more when it is finished</li>
    <li> Usually I buy the Angel Men blue one, but this one is very good. The smell  has a note of tobacco at first glance, but after minutes, the tobacco gets less strong and the classic Angel Men comes more pronounced. As result you get the personality of the Angel Men with a touch of masculinity given by the tobacco note.  Very good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this multiple times but not from this site. Very pleased with my purchase and the delivery time. I love the soft smell and a little goes a long way. The cost from this website was the best price I&#x27;ve paid for it thus far.</li>
    <li> I have over 40 bottles of cologne and this is by far my favorite.  I actually have 3 bottles of this stored away in the package so I don&#x27;t run out.  Cheery tobacco turning into honey vanilla, it&#x27;s just amazing.  Perfect cool weather smell.</li>
    <li> This is currently my favorite cologne. It does not project well on me because of my dry skin but I plan to experiment carefully with extra sprays. I am glad it is not discontinued. I would miss it and I will by again.</li>
    <li> I heard so many good things about this fragrance. I have yet to get a single compliment, even one from me. Lol. I have not warmed up the it yet.</li>
    <li> Excellent...exactly what I ordered</li>
    <li> One of my top five fragrances.  I love the cherry and the pipe smell (good pipe- and no, I don&#x27;t mean that kind of pipe).</li>
    <li> Honey and fresh rolled cigars.</li>
    <li> Hands down the best  smelling cologne that I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> As described,would purchase again from seller</li>
