      <li>and I am so glad I did!  </li>
      <li>I really liked the product for what it&#x27;s intended to do.</li>
      <li>It lifts the eyelids wonderfully and the strips are transparent, giving the person a natural look.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
      <li>and they sure didn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>/&gt;These may not work for everyone, but if they do, I think you&#x27;ll really be pleased.</li>
      <li>and now it hides quite well and still lifts my eyelid better than without it anyway.</li>
      <li>My eyes don&#x27;t look hooded any more</li>
      <li>/&gt;I was able to figure it out with some practice.</li>
      <li>It did not take me many attempts at all.  </li>
      <li>When using this product, make sure to read the instructions and take your time.  </li>
      <li>I came across Eye Magic on Amazon when looking for eye cream.  </li>
      <li>in all, I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
      <li>I am sure practicing would help, too.    </li>
      <li>The one day I was able to put them on correctly, I looked more awake, and also found that I could see a lot better because of the lift.  </li>
      <li>It takes a while to get good at applying them, but worth the effort.</li>
      <li>The advice in the review above from the makeup artist is perfect.  </li>
      <li>I have found that when I use the tapes, each time I see myself in a mirror, I look more alert and somehow this makes me feel more alert.  </li>
      <li>(a favorite pastime</li>
      <li>The Eye Magic strips provided virtually no lift &amp; my eyes</li>
      <li>I was very excited about it.</li>
      <li>It was easy and fast to apply and worked great.  </li>
      <li>Lol, In all fairness to seller, I never complained about the purchase.</li>
      <li>I loved this product once u know where to exactly place it on your lid</li>
      <li>The results are quite minimal at best.</li>
      <li>They also make my eyes so much more comfortable as when they are off I can feel the weight of saggy eyelids</li>
      <li>Good adhesion, but not too much.  </li>
      <li>They are amazing at making it look like I had eyelift surgery if you get them on in the right place</li>
      <li>/&gt;It was easy to use</li>
      <li>/&gt;They have the texture of &amp;#34;Scoth Magic Tape&amp;#34;, y&#x27;know the frosted kind of tape, not the shiney kind, only uch thinner and lighter.</li>
      <li>I am really amazed at how well Eye Magic works!  </li>
      <li>I wore them at home without makeup for a day and they were fine and comfortable, and gave my eye a lift.</li>
      <li>It does give me a nice lift until I can afford a real eye lift.</li>
      <li>Smooth out the rest and then leave it alone.</li>
      <li>This is one fantastic product.</li>
      <li>and thought they might be good for my professional kit ..</li>
      <li>I have very heavy hooded eyes and use eye magic when I&#x27;m going out with friends or a special occasion and want to look my best.</li>
      <li>It really is easy and quick to apply.  </li>
      <li>There is a variety and you might have to figure out which one is best for you, but I came to find out that there are better products that I can actually use in public.</li>
      <li>the best thing of all, no one told me I looked tired :)  </li>
      <li>yeah, I won&#x27;t be throwing them out just yet and will not try to return them, but they&#x27;re just going to be for special occasions or special photos.</li>
      <li>I thought it would help me, specially because mine is almost imperceptible.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I wear them everyday and am especially happy that I actually have better eyesight once the droop is lifted!  </li>
      <li>The price is amazing for what it does one box lasts a whole month used everyday , thank you Eye Magic !!</li>
      <li>They are easy to apply and really do hold up my droopy lids.  </li>
      <li>Works really well, easy to apply and don&#x27;t show.  </li>
      <li>The eye lifts are fine and very helpful if you can put them on correctly.  </li>
      <li>even your own 2 eyes :) so these take a little practice.</li>
      <li>I believe they are worth the price and the effort to learn application.</li>
      <li>couple of years ago I decided to try Eye Magic and was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
      <li>but it is not even worth the price.</li>
      <li>And it is definitely worth the $1.45/ day.</li>
      <li>Many reviews complain that the strips are visible--unable to be hidden--look like ‘band-aids’ on your eyes--need to be cut SMALLER to fit--  </li>
      <li>I have read all the reviews of this product, and I honestly have no idea how it could be the same product I received, (and returned)</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, I quickly figured out that the strips were very much visible.</li>
      <li>I would recommend it to anyone who wants to appear younger, better rested, or just more interested in life.</li>
      <li>I found I got my best results when I placed the strip slightly below the lid crease and towards the outside of my eye.  </li>
      <li>You get what you pay for, a quick fix, common sense applies that you naturally have to find what positioning works best for you, but when applied correctly, the result is pretty satisfactory.</li>
      <li>The effect is not dramatic like an eye lift, but if you find you are looking in the mirror and focusing on your droopy or flabby eyelids, I think you&#x27;ll be very pleasantly surprised by Eye Magic.  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re easy to apply and seriously took a good 10 years of the hooding of my upp eye lids.</li>
      <li>to \\&quot;very much visible\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>it will show a little so for those i either cut them length wise thinner or just dont use them.</li>
      <li>First, you have to find where to apply it.  </li>
      <li>Love these eye tapes for daily usage.</li>
      <li>enough to be satisfied spending the money.  </li>
      <li>I will be using it on a semi-regular basis, I am sure and will order from you again in the future!</li>
      <li>Pull your lid taught (pull up from under your brow), place the top arch of the strip deep into the crease, the highest point of the arch should match the highest point of the arch of your eyebrow.</li>
      <li>I wish I could find something similar to apply more at the root of my hair.  </li>
      <li>First, they don&#x27;t work.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Get some of the higher rated \\&quot;eyelid tapes\\&quot;</li>
      <li>I wish I could post a before and after for you because it definitely looks better.</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>After removing the tape, it made me wonder that if my eyelids would droop more over time if I used this product on a regular basis.  </li>
      <li>I think occasional use would be a better idea.</li>
      <li>I pretty well suspected they wouldn&#x27;t work as advertised</li>
      <li>So my tip is TURN THEM UPSIDE DOWN for more lift!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I really liked the product for what it&#x27;s intended to do. The only negative is that you can see it up close.</li>
    <li> I decided to take a chance on this product and was very happy with it.  I have one extra-droopy eyelid and with the eye magic, it matches the other.  I often wear the same one twice.  It really is easy and quick to apply.  If you break a sweat, it will come off.</li>
    <li> These work as well as you&#x27;d expect two pieces of plastic strips to. I used a different company before I discovered this, and have been using them for about two years now. You get what you pay for, a quick fix, common sense applies that you naturally have to find what positioning works best for you, but when applied correctly, the result is pretty satisfactory. While I&#x27;m pleased, I like the effect better when I&#x27;m wearing a headband or a bandanna while they&#x27;re on, it just lends that little extra pull from the upper brow to really do the trick. You can see that you&#x27;re wearing something from certain angles, it&#x27;s not completely invisible, but the newer versions are a much bigger improvement. I used to get asked a lot what I had on my eyes, but not as much since the new models came out. The biggest downside to these are that you cannot really wear makeup over them. No eye-shadow or any type of eyeliner, they really stick out if you do. I&#x27;ve worn these overnight and through showers, they&#x27;re pretty resilient and will only come off if you get them wet and rub into your eyes with a towel or your fingers while washing your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some helpful tips when using these:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use a hint of petroleum jelly before applying, just slide a little onto your lid, then apply regularly. It really helps lubricating so you can adjust them as long as you need before the little rub they give you to put on the strips themselves dries out. This is also a useful trick when you want to readjust the strips again later in the day, but be careful because the strips will dry onto your lids a while after the first application, and you won&#x27;t get as great a seal as you do after they&#x27;re first allowed to dry. Not sure what the science behind that is, and in fact is not always necessarily the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These may not work for everyone, but if they do, I think you&#x27;ll really be pleased. It&#x27;s your call to take the gamble. My suggestion would be not to give up after disappointing initial uses, it takes some time to perfect the art of figuring them out and how big of an adjustment best compliments your overall face.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised that these actually worked! They&#x27;re easy to apply and seriously took a good 10 years of the hooding of my upp eye lids. A great alternative for those who aren&#x27;t up for surgery but want to look their best.</li>
    <li> The product is not that hard to apply, but when you close your eye, you look like you have a piece of tape on your eyelid.  I also had no visible \\&quot;lift\\&quot; as compared to the eye without the tape.  A waste of money.</li>
    <li> Great product,really works.Thanks</li>
    <li> The eyelid tape was not very easy to apply.  I had watched a video clip prior to purchase and it looked very simple.   [...]    It took several attempts to find where on my eyelid to put it and not be visible and not distort my eyelid.  However, once I did, I could notice a small difference...enough to be satisfied spending the money.  I am sure practicing would help, too.    After removing the tape, it made me wonder that if my eyelids would droop more over time if I used this product on a regular basis.  I think occasional use would be a better idea.</li>
    <li> Not happy with product</li>
    <li> I really wanted this product to work.  And it does work as far as fixing my drooping eyelid -looked great.  The only problem is that you can see the patch.  I tried it under makeup, over makeup, placing it in different locations.  I used almost a whole box experimenting.  Wore them anyway to see if anyone would notice.  Took my son with me to work and of course he kept asking me what was on my eye.  I tried to shush him, but then he started asking my co-workers if they noticed anything on my eyes.  It was not good.</li>
    <li> I have read all the reviews of this product, and I honestly have no idea how it could be the same product I received, (and returned) Many reviews complain that the strips are visible--unable to be hidden--look like ‘band-aids’ on your eyes--need to be cut SMALLER to fit--  I cannot imagine that they are describing the same product that I received.  These Tiny, really tiny, bits of transparent tape...(they are maybe the size of a flattened grain of rice...) were impossible for me to manipulate and apply, even with tweezers..and it’s impossible to imagine anyone cutting it smaller! I also never realized, maybe I should have, how impossible it would be to see them and apply them without my glasses, (and also WITH my glasses)  to compare them to band-aids is ludicrous...it is also misleading, though not intentional.  They are one inch long and so thin I could not measure them.This is the first , and last, time I have ever bought anything like this.  I am waiting for eyelid surgery, and thought these might help in the meantime, as it’s getting harder to read.  they were a real disappointment, and shock.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t imagine how these little tapes could work, and even now that I&#x27;m using them, I still don&#x27;t quite understand how the magic happens.  But they do indeed raise my eyelids subtly, they are virtually invisible, and they are far easier to apply than I expected.    The effect is not dramatic like an eye lift, but if you find you are looking in the mirror and focusing on your droopy or flabby eyelids, I think you&#x27;ll be very pleasantly surprised by Eye Magic.  I have found that when I use the tapes, each time I see myself in a mirror, I look more alert and somehow this makes me feel more alert.  Not a bad return on a small investment!</li>
    <li> The Eye Magic strips provided virtually no lift &amp; my eyes looked as if I had put band aides on them.</li>
    <li> I am really amazed at how well Eye Magic works!  Thanks to my dad&#x27;s side of the family, I am genetically cursed with droopy eye lids.  I am 48 years old and have been considering an eye lid lift for my 50th birthday present to myself, I am soooo over people I don&#x27;t even know telling me how tired I look!  I came across Eye Magic on Amazon when looking for eye cream.  I read the reviews and decided to give it a try....and I am so glad I did!  When using this product, make sure to read the instructions and take your time.  The strips are hard to see so you may need to use reading glasses.  The strips are extremely sticky on one side so I would advise using tweezers to help remove them.  Remove one strip at a time with the tweezers and wipe a small amount of gel (more like the consistancy of Carmex)to the sticky side of the strip. Once the gel has been applied the tweezers are no longer needed.  You will have approximately 1-2 minutes to place (and remove and replace if needed) the strip on the crease of your eye lid (I used a magnifying mirror to help me locate the eye crease). After 1-2 minutes the effects of the gel wears off and the stickiness of the strip returns holding the strip in place.  It did not take me many attempts at all.  I found I got my best results when I placed the strip slightly below the lid crease and towards the outside of my eye.  The results are AMAZING!  I was told I looked younger, my eyes were bigger and the best thing of all, no one told me I looked tired :)  I am still going to get that eye lid lift when I turn 50, but until then I found the perfect fix!</li>
    <li> I did not expect too much from that product , but it really makes a big difference.  The strip is totally almost invisible, so i don&#x27;t understand previous comments about the strip being too visible?? I can hardly see it to remove it myself... Your eyes are lifted at least 40%.  I just have not tried it all day yet, so i wonder if the \\&quot;staying power\\&quot; is good.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT WORKS VERY WELL.  I USE IT EVERY DAY. EXCELLENT PRODUCT ...</li>
    <li> First, you have to find where to apply it.  As other people said, you may not have to apply the same way on both eyes.  I found the way but after a few hours, I started to see the strips.  I kept the product because with the return shipping fees, it would not have saved me much money but it is not even worth the price. I wish I could find something similar to apply more at the root of my hair.  This will lift my eyebrow but also erase other wrinkles.</li>
    <li> The item arrived before the expected date.  I really like the product because it RealAudio helps my dripping eyelids</li>
    <li> Still playing with it, I don&#x27;t quite have it perfected yet.</li>
    <li> The only magic with this is I was dumb enough to fall for this. Lol, In all fairness to seller, I never complained about the purchase.</li>
    <li> I have one eye that droops more than the other, and sensitive thin skin. This product works well for both problems. The only drawback is that they are a little too long for me so I cut them, which is a pain. But I have tried other brands which are shorter and they don&#x27;t stick or work as well. I wear them everyday and am especially happy that I actually have better eyesight once the droop is lifted!  *****  Count on wasting five or six pair until you get the hang of it. The advice in the review above from the makeup artist is perfect.  **** If you wear heavy eye makeup daily, I don&#x27;t know if these would work. I&#x27;m in my fifties and wear just faint eyeliner and mascara. *****  One drawback: they&#x27;re seriously overpriced, considering what else is on the market. Since you get what you pay for, I get that these are going to be more expensive, but come ON. Five times the cost of some others?</li>
    <li> I LOVED this product. It really does what it promises. It lifts the eyelids wonderfully and the strips are transparent, giving the person a natural look.&lt;br /&gt;When all strips are gone, I&#x27;ll definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I like the way it opens up my eyes. Only con is that it is not completely invisible.</li>
    <li> The product totally failed me. Can i get my money back? I do not see a guarantee on the package, i barely used it.</li>
    <li> If you are not going to be talking to anyone or standing close to them, this could work.  I can&#x27;t imagine not seeing something funky on my eyelid if I wore them in public.  I&#x27;d rather have baggy eyes than have tape showing between the bags.  Oh man...</li>
    <li> I had to give these a try. I pretty well suspected they wouldn&#x27;t work as advertised and they sure didn&#x27;t. The peel up at corners, develop air bubbles, and are too small length wise to fit well enough so you don&#x27;t have a quarter of your eye lid not matching the rest. It make the eye look distorted and unbecoming. They aren&#x27;t at all what product itself claims it to be.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. Practically invisible and gives you that eye lift you always wanted but couldn&#x27;t afford to do. Leave them on while u sleep and u won&#x27;t wake up with puffy eyelids. Then take them off and apply new ones.</li>
    <li> After trying some cheap unbranded eye lid lift products for a few dollars less I decided to buy Eye Magic , I am so glad I did it is now my regular monthly priority beauty item. It has given me the confidence I needed. The price is amazing for what it does one box lasts a whole month used everyday , thank you Eye Magic !! WOW !</li>
    <li> Not that great .. Would be awesome if you could hide them better.. You have to have a lot of skin to hide under I guess.. Because it lifted my eye great but even when they are cut short or thin.. I can still see them.. Played w/ them for awhile trying to conceal.. Maybe if it was dark and was going out.. They are pretty obvious in my opinion..</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. 1. It doesn&#x27;t work 2. It is clearly visible. It just looks odd</li>
    <li> It  takes getting used to putting them on correctly. They stay on all day and even while sleeping at&lt;br /&gt;night. They are slightly visible but no one has been aware of them until I told them. I have been using them for a few months and will continue. until I can have surgery.</li>
    <li> I have heavy eyelids and this really opens my eyes up. It takes a while to get good at applying them, but worth the effort.</li>
    <li> i am a freelance makeup artist/stylist. i have been doing this for 20+years and am now in my early 40&#x27;s. that being said i am always on the lookout for things that have a youthful enhancing effect. (for myself and my on camera ppl!)i saw these tapes when looking at before and after cosmetic surgery photos online (a favorite pastime ;) and thought they might be good for my professional kit ..if they worked. i LOVE this product! every eye is different! even your own 2 eyes :) so these take a little practice. but when you get it right the effect can be from a subtle enhancing to extremely dramatic. the trick i have learned is this- when looking at the sagging eyelid..put the tape centered ON the wrinkle of the sag..not the sag itself. try this out and experiment a little for your eye! i have used these on many eye shapes for on camera and photos! some eyes it will show a little so for those i either cut them length wise thinner or just dont use them. i have had clients almost cry when they say the result. i am going to try a few other brands too but am getting more of these as well because they work!</li>
    <li> When I hit my 60&#x27;s my eyelids started dropping so much that they would mess up my eyeliner, as well as making me look tired.  I first tried a couple of expensive liquid eye lift solutions but they left a residue on the lids and did not lift my lids enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of years ago I decided to try Eye Magic and was pleasantly surprised.  They are easy to apply and really do hold up my droopy lids.  They are also nearly invisible on my lids.  Now that I&#x27;m in my mid-60&#x27;s I need to wear them almost daily.</li>
    <li> The product may be good for old women in general, but definitely DOES NOT work for people with ptosis (eyelid) as it is announced in their website. I thought it would help me, specially because mine is almost imperceptible.&lt;br /&gt;I tried to put it on in 3 different ways and what I got was that my eyelid seemed even bigger.</li>
    <li> They look great. Make eyes look much younger, but you can see them when you blink. They are perfect if you are considering eyelid surgery. Sort of a preview of what is to come.</li>
    <li> The eye strip is completely noticeable, especially close up.  It takes so longer to even get a natural look and evenness.  The results are quite minimal at best.</li>
    <li> The product gets sticky in one side only, so if your eyelids are irregular and you are looking for a product to correct them, this might be an option, but it&#x27;s noticeable.</li>
    <li> First, they don&#x27;t work.  They are very hard to work with, place on the eyelid, and set in place.  They are VERY visible. Their claims are false, at least for me.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t work at all. They look like you put clear stickers over your eyelid area, and you can totally see them. Didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> It was exactly as described, my friend recommended it for a short term night out and it worked.&lt;br /&gt;It was easy to use</li>
    <li> Amazed at how well it lifted my sagging lids. Makes me feel madeover for such a small expense. On my second box.</li>
    <li> Next to impossible to use correctly.  Awkward to apply, then would either hurt when removed or would not stick.  I stopped using this product after five frustrating applications.  In addition, it is next to  impossible for them to not show!!  Covering them with makeup makes it worse.</li>
    <li> I cannot believe these things work. I was shocked. They really aren&#x27;t that hard to put on, if you place them deep in the crease of your eye. I still can&#x27;t quite figure out how they work, but I think they flatten out that area so that the extra skin sinks deeper into the crease, creating the illusion of a lift. Hard to describe. Can you see them? Ehhhh... a teeny bit. But only if you&#x27;re REALLY looking. Sweep a bit of neutral shadow underneath and you&#x27;re good to go. I use them on one eye only because I have a unilateral lid lag. I wish I could post a before and after for you because it definitely looks better. An awesome alternative to surgery (I&#x27;m not ready for that). I plan to use these pretty much every day as a part of my makeup routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re struggling with them, dont give up. Pull your lid taught (pull up from under your brow), place the top arch of the strip deep into the crease, the highest point of the arch should match the highest point of the arch of your eyebrow. Smooth out the rest and then leave it alone. If you can feel it, you&#x27;ve done it wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m pleased. Message me if you want clarification on application. I&#x27;m happy to help!</li>
    <li> They work quite well once I figured out how to handle them. I will order them again in the future.</li>
    <li> The eye lifts are fine and very helpful if you can put them on correctly.  I haven&#x27;t gotten the knack of it yet because they are tiny and hard to see.  The one day I was able to put them on correctly, I looked more awake, and also found that I could see a lot better because of the lift.  I believe they are worth the price and the effort to learn application.</li>
    <li> Used a few times. Wish that they could be covered with eye shadow so they&#x27;re not so noticeable.</li>
    <li> I tried these a while back for a drooping upper eyelid and threw them out. They are a shiny clear material, Why? Why not a matte clear or matte flesh-colored material? They show like crazy, even if you cut them. I mean, for an eyelid, occasionally one blinks. It looks ridiculous. I even wrote to them and complained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you could put foundation over it, that would be one thing, but you can&#x27;t - the material is terrible and slippery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are there no such things anymore as product tests?</li>
    <li> The package arrived yesterday.  I tried it on my droopy left eye lid this morning and left it on all day today.  It was easy and fast to apply and worked great.  I will be using it on a semi-regular basis, I am sure and will order from you again in the future!</li>
    <li> They do lift the eyelid as they say but I have tried everyway I can think of to make them not show up. I tried makeup under them over them, no makeup. If someone has a trick to make them invisible on the eyelid please let me know. They are amazing at making it look like I had eyelift surgery if you get them on in the right place but no matter what I tried you can see them. It&#x27;s frustrating to find a product that does what it says and not be able to use it.</li>
    <li> I guess if you are considering surgery, or are curious as to what you may look like, these may help. Do not wear these in public though!! You can CLEARLY see these little patches on your eyes, I will not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Worthless; didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
    <li> Love these eye tapes for daily usage. I learned to apply makeup and that way they are not noticeable of the eyelid.  They make me look 5 years younger...(-;</li>
    <li> I loved this product once u know where to exactly place it on your lid it instantly open the eyes. Not to mention their amazing customer service! I have lost one shipment and they sent me another one immediatly and when i recieved my lost one and asked them to sent it back they were so generous to let me keep it and i have gave it to a friend to try it out . Would recommend this to anyone</li>
    <li> It took a good box of these, practicing getting them applied, but once I finally had it down I was very excited about it. It did what it said it would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I quickly figured out that the strips were very much visible. I think it&#x27;s a combination of natural skin oil and the applicant, as well as the strips themselves being pretty wide. The strip then turns from \\&quot;not so visible\\&quot; to \\&quot;very much visible\\&quot;. No, you can&#x27;t see them when your eyes are open, but any time you blink or look down (which is far more often than you might think, eg. check the time, read the menu), it&#x27;s embarrassingly evident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get some of the higher rated \\&quot;eyelid tapes\\&quot; instead. There is a variety and you might have to figure out which one is best for you, but I came to find out that there are better products that I can actually use in public.</li>
    <li> It takes a few times to begin to get the hang of it, but if you have a hooded eyelid this product really works. It seriously lifts and creases the heavy part of your kid. My only complaints are that they are expensive and are not completely transparent, but I&#x27;ve tried a few other brands (dup) and nothing else worked.</li>
    <li> This is my second review because I accidentally discovered something I want to share about these eye lift tabs.  I have been using them daily for about four years.  They work great for me and make a visible difference in the appearance of my eyes.  They also make my eyes so much more comfortable as when they are off I can feel the weight of saggy eyelids and it is an ever-present discomfort.  So my tip is TURN THEM UPSIDE DOWN for more lift!  put the curve side DOWN and the straight edge up, wow...even more lift.</li>
    <li> Works really well, easy to apply and don&#x27;t show.  I will buy these again.</li>
    <li> I wore them at home without makeup for a day and they were fine and comfortable, and gave my eye a lift. Then I tried them with makeup, again, just at home and out running errands -- but I would never wear them to work (I&#x27;m a college teacher). I wouldn&#x27;t wear them where I&#x27;d be having close-up conversations with people, unless it was in a dimly lit party/ evening atmosphere. They do show if observed closely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have the texture of &amp;#34;Scoth Magic Tape&amp;#34;, y&#x27;know the frosted kind of tape, not the shiney kind, only uch thinner and lighter. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d be able to handle them AND false eyelashes at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to figure it out with some practice. It helped to think about curving them around the shape of my eyeball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yeah, I won&#x27;t be throwing them out just yet and will not try to return them, but they&#x27;re just going to be for special occasions or special photos.</li>
    <li> As the product mentions, it will take a while to learn how to use the product on yourself. It&#x27;s all trial and error but no major complaints so far.</li>
    <li> These simply DO NOT WORK.  I purchased two packages (my bad) and eventually had to give up.  I tried every thing imaginable, had friends help me, etc, and they simply did not work.  Nothing but a waste of time and money.</li>
    <li> This is one fantastic product. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to appear younger, better rested, or just more interested in life.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It really works so well that I use it every day. My eyes don&#x27;t look hooded any more and I don&#x27;t look tired and angry any more. It is a wonderful alternative to eye lid surgery. Do expect to take a little bit of time initially to find the right location for your eyes. But, after that it only takes a few seconds. And it is definitely worth the $1.45/ day.</li>
    <li> I have small eyes and the strip of tape, albeit lifting my eyelids was very visible due to being too wide. I decide to cut the little strip in half lengthwise  and now it hides quite well and still lifts my eyelid better than without it anyway. If it&#x27;s too visible, try cutting the strip in half lengthwise and see if it works for you.</li>
    <li> Good adhesion, but not too much.  Sometimes they can be used again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second package. Was a bit skeptical at first but they really do work. I have very heavy hooded eyes and use eye magic when I&#x27;m going out with friends or a special occasion and want to look my best. It does give me a nice lift until I can afford a real eye lift.</li>
    <li> I have hooded lids that now hang on my upper eyelashes. I was considering an upper eyelid surgery but was googling around and came across these. With just a tiny bit of practice I am now adept at applying them, such that you can actually see my eyelids again. I do need to use 2 on one side and 3 on the other side and the trick is to build them up right in the crease, each one a little higher up than the next one and a little to the side. I honestly think I look a few years younger and not half as tired. Even without make-up you can&#x27;t really see them at all (I am very fairskinned and in my 50&#x27;s) and you can sweep a bit of color over them. I don&#x27;t tend to wear a great deal of make-up anyway. The hardest part, for me, is not applying them but removing them at the end of the day, as they stay snug so well. I use tweezers both to apply and remove them but it doesn&#x27;t take longer than inserting or removing contact lenses or apply a coat of mascara would. A huge bargain that has made a massive difference in how I look.</li>
