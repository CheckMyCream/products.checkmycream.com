### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Excellent directions were provided with the shipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a real win win</li>
      <li>It is a great disinfectant and will keep your shaver</li>
      <li>It is pleasant without being overbearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Its pleasant smell is icing on the  cake.</li>
      <li>It is good not to throw away the cleaning cartriges</li>
      <li>Be warned that cleaning the cartridges to reuse them is a pain in the neck in all cases but if the money savings are worth it for you this is probably the best solution.</li>
      <li>Nice idea, though.</li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>Sure we want to save money</li>
      <li>Such an awesome replacement for my razor.  </li>
      <li>This has many advantages:&lt;br /</li>
      <li>I love that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great price and cleans my braun shaver as good as original,also smells great,also was very quick shipping,seems to last in braun holding unit longer</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not bad; it smells good; it just doesn&#x27;t clean as well.  </li>
      <li>Nice part is I can now shave right out of the shower.</li>
      <li>The cartridge rinsing and refilling was extremely easy and I had a smooth experience in each time I used it for refilling.</li>
      <li>The product also seems to do a fine job cleaning the razor.  </li>
      <li>The savings are obvious, the cleaning is great and the shave is smooth.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m keeping it around just in case I find myself without a usable filled Braun cartridge temporarily, but it&#x27;s a substitute.</li>
      <li>cleaning is just the same as the Braun cartridge and the shaver performs great.</li>
      <li>The original solvent is Methanol, this is Isopropinol.</li>
      <li>I had been looking for a refill solution for Braun cartridges for a while when I stumbled on this product and was excited to try it.</li>
      <li>When I used the original cleaner, the gead was spotless.</li>
      <li>But for a product to convince me it&#x27;s worth the time to spend washing out the used cartridges (which is not that easy), it has to perform at lease close to the original and for a significant savings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been hitting the clean cycle just before I shave.</li>
      <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t have to clean it.  </li>
      <li>but they need to come clean about what you are getting.  </li>
      <li>It just doesn&#x27;t clean as well as the alcohol based Braun solution.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t really clean the razor, just redistributed the hair to where you see it, and then it sticks all over your face if you use the razor with out cleaning it.  </li>
      <li>The issue for me is that this product just doesn&#x27;t clean the razor as well as the Braun formula does.  </li>
      <li>I wanted to like this, it is much cheaper and more environmentally friendly than the Braun replacements.  </li>
      <li>Full of stubble and skin particles.</li>
      <li>I love that it is much cheaper than the Braun cartridges and</li>
      <li>Again, not the primary feature you may purchase a shaver cleaning solution for, but there&#x27;s something to be said for the uplifting feeling of the smell of lemon or some other pleasant fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>High pleased with performance and ease of use.  </li>
      <li>It meant that the replacement product was not lubricating (or cleaning) the shaver as well as the original and this could lead to poorer shave quality and more frequent blade replacements.  </li>
      <li>The specific gravity or conductivity must be off because it just ran and ran without showing a better clean reading.</li>
      <li>They both had a slight pleasant fragrance, but nothing that I was hoping for.  </li>
      <li>I have been using Braun Clean for few months and can consider it as a better option than the original one.</li>
      <li>It is one of the best alternatives to expensive Braun cartridges.</li>
      <li>that cleaning your blade with alcohol was not &amp;#34;environmentally friendly&amp;#34; in the first place is beyond me, but whatever...</li>
      <li>It is more fluid than water</li>
      <li>This product doesn&#x27;t contain alcohol, which is nice, but that may be why my Braun doesn&#x27;t dry properly when I run a clean cycle.  </li>
      <li>you really want to refill your cartridges, just mix the components yourself, there are videos on Youtube that show how to do this.</li>
      <li>As is mentioned elsewhere this product is really better off using while it is still wet.  </li>
      <li>Just snip the corner and gently squeeze into container.</li>
      <li>After a couple of weeks of daily cleanings with the Shaver Shebang stuff, there was clearly gunk (for lack of a better word) accumulating under the razor head.  </li>
      <li>&amp;#34;replacement&amp;#34; on the other hand is mostly composed of distilled water.</li>
      <li>After several weeks of testing, the inside of my shaver was way dirtier than it had ever been with the original cartridges.</li>
      <li>At first this solution cleaned okay and left the wet sheen to the blade of my Braun 790 and did</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product to everyone who uses Braun cleaning cartridges.</li>
      <li>A great alternative to the expensive and wasteful braun cartridges.</li>
      <li>my new shaver will never see this stuff.  </li>
      <li>I felt that the Braun solution made the razor feel new every time I used it.</li>
      <li>It evaporates quickly so your blade will dry off</li>
      <li>Unlike the Braun that left a lemony smell after a cleaning that was evident during a shave, the Shaver Shebang replacement products did not provide any sort of noticeable aromatherapy during the shaves.  </li>
      <li>quickly switched back to the Braun OEM cleaner cartridge and like magic it cleaned the blade/cutter block much better and did not clog the base module like this aftermarket cleaner</li>
      <li>However, the extra lubricants really do make for a smoother shave.</li>
      <li>If they ever get a better solution that will drain and not leave residue buildup I would use again but the current formula is not worth anything as far as an actual cleaning product that operates like the OEM solution.</li>
      <li>, the product does seem to do a decent job of removing the detritus well enough.</li>
      <li>Throwing out the fancy Braun cartridge each time just to get more fluid always seemed like a such a waste.</li>
      <li>key here is that this product does not remotely clean your shaver as well as the original Braun product does.</li>
      <li>Sometimes if the razor is already clean I just run it for a few seconds to wet the shaver.</li>

<li> Even worse, when I used my shaver it would still be wet from the previous day&#x27;s cleaning.</li>
<li> So to conclude, I rated this product as 3 stars for doing a sufficient job of cleaning and providing a cost-saving option to the expensive manufacturer solution, but dropping a couple for an apparent reduction in lubrication and insufficient pick-me-up</li>
<li> Not sure I like it.</li>
<li> and they didn&#x27;t pack their charger since they hadn&#x27;t needed it on past trips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> /&gt;I was a bit wary of using a water based solution that intentionally leaves the shaver wet.</li>
<li> You simply cannot go wrong by using this!</li>
<li> so it flows through very small cracks.&lt;br</li>
<li> I found I was constantly cleaning the base alot rather than yearly</li>
<li> however it started clogging the shaver base and not properly draining and leaving alot of stubble build up in the razor itself.  </li>
<li> The refill cartridges from Braun are expensive.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t find washing the Braun cartridges out difficult.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately, it leaves the shaver head wet with oil for days, which feels disgusting on the face.  </li>
<li> Whoever is reading this is probably sick of paying Braun&#x27;s outrageous prices.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting. Don&#x27;t waste your time and money on these. Cleaning doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> It is good not to throw away the cleaning cartriges</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this, it is much cheaper and more environmentally friendly than the Braun replacements.  Unfortunately, it leaves the shaver head wet with oil for days, which feels disgusting on the face.  It also just covered the outside of the razor head with hair shavings.  It didn&#x27;t really clean the razor, just redistributed the hair to where you see it, and then it sticks all over your face if you use the razor with out cleaning it.  I got the self cleaning razor so I wouldn&#x27;t have to clean it.  I wont be ordering it again.</li>
    <li> As other reviews state, the shaver takes a long time to dry. If I shave every other day then it is usually dry when I use it. If I shave daily, then the shaver will still be wet. There are ALWAYS hairs and stubble affixed to the outside of the shaver head that I must brush off before using. It just doesn&#x27;t clean as well as the alcohol based Braun solution. It is cheaper and uses less waste, but it doesn&#x27;t provide me the feel like a new razor after cleaning. I felt that the Braun solution made the razor feel new every time I used it.</li>
    <li> Such an awesome replacement for my razor.  High pleased with performance and ease of use.  You simply cannot go wrong by using this!</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t contain alcohol, which is nice, but that may be why my Braun doesn&#x27;t dry properly when I run a clean cycle.  I won&#x27;t be buying this again.  Nice idea, though.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s face it.  We all want to save money.  The refill cartridges from Braun are expensive.  But for a product to convince me it&#x27;s worth the time to spend washing out the used cartridges (which is not that easy), it has to perform at lease close to the original and for a significant savings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the Shaver Shebang products, I immediately noticed that it sounded like the razor was working slower than after using the Clean-N-Renew from Braun.  This is worrisome for 2 reasons.  It meant that the replacement product was not lubricating (or cleaning) the shaver as well as the original and this could lead to poorer shave quality and more frequent blade replacements.  Secondly, the extra load on the shaver would shorten the battery life -- the duration between charges.  This may increase the utility bill slightly, but perhaps a bigger concern would be for travelers who are bound to get caught short when it runs out of charge faster than it used to with the Braun cleaner and they didn&#x27;t pack their charger since they hadn&#x27;t needed it on past trips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now regarding my next quibble, which may be less of a sticking point for some, I&#x27;ll share my opinion on the fragrance (or lack there of [Yoda must have come up with that saying]).  I purchased 2 &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; of the replacement cleaning solution -- the mint and the citrus tree.  They both had a slight pleasant fragrance, but nothing that I was hoping for.  Unlike the Braun that left a lemony smell after a cleaning that was evident during a shave, the Shaver Shebang replacement products did not provide any sort of noticeable aromatherapy during the shaves.  Again, not the primary feature you may purchase a shaver cleaning solution for, but there&#x27;s something to be said for the uplifting feeling of the smell of lemon or some other pleasant fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a final note, the product does seem to do a decent job of removing the detritus well enough. (There I used my big word for the week...  hope I used it Write...)  So to conclude, I rated this product as 3 stars for doing a sufficient job of cleaning and providing a cost-saving option to the expensive manufacturer solution, but dropping a couple for an apparent reduction in lubrication and insufficient pick-me-up smellification.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards.</li>
    <li> A great alternative to the expensive and wasteful braun cartridges. it&#x27;s a real win win</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a refill solution for Braun cartridges for a while when I stumbled on this product and was excited to try it. Unfortunately, the results are extremely disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;Braun cartridges are mostly made of alcohol. This has many advantages:&lt;br /&gt;* It is a great disinfectant and will keep your shaver sanitary.&lt;br /&gt;* It evaporates quickly so your blade will dry off fast.&lt;br /&gt;* It is more fluid than water so it flows through very small cracks.&lt;br /&gt;This &amp;#34;replacement&amp;#34; on the other hand is mostly composed of distilled water. Why they though that cleaning your blade with alcohol was not &amp;#34;environmentally friendly&amp;#34; in the first place is beyond me, but whatever...&lt;br /&gt;The key here is that this product does not remotely clean your shaver as well as the original Braun product does. After several weeks of testing, the inside of my shaver was way dirtier than it had ever been with the original cartridges. Even worse, when I used my shaver it would still be wet from the previous day&#x27;s cleaning. They call it &amp;#34;refreshing and moisturizing&amp;#34;. I call it garbage. It would make my skin wet when shaving which then caused it to get rashes from the blade friction. No more dry shaves with this product. I shudder to think what having permanent water residue in your shaver will do to the metal components in the long run. I won&#x27;t find out since I went back to using regular Braun cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;If you really want to refill your cartridges, just mix the components yourself, there are videos on Youtube that show how to do this. You will end up with a much better quality product than this junk at a tiny fraction of the cost ($15 a bottle is some seriously expensive water). Be warned that cleaning the cartridges to reuse them is a pain in the neck in all cases but if the money savings are worth it for you this is probably the best solution.</li>
    <li> At first this solution cleaned okay and left the wet sheen to the blade of my Braun 790 and did okay given it is not a OEM product.  Overtime however it started clogging the shaver base and not properly draining and leaving alot of stubble build up in the razor itself.  I found I was constantly cleaning the base alot rather than yearly like I had been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I quickly switched back to the Braun OEM cleaner cartridge and like magic it cleaned the blade/cutter block much better and did not clog the base module like this aftermarket cleaner solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So would I recommend this product...............no not at all.  If they ever get a better solution that will drain and not leave residue buildup I would use again but the current formula is not worth anything as far as an actual cleaning product that operates like the OEM solution.</li>
    <li> this solution gums up the razor heads.  instead of cleaning them it turns them into a solid, gooey mess.  they spin this as providing &#x27;lubricant&#x27; for your shave.  three weeks after using this product my electric shaver ceased to work.  battery?  motor? do not know.&lt;br /&gt;correlation does not guarantee causality, but one wonders.  my new shaver will never see this stuff.  i threw it out.</li>
    <li> I have been using Braun Clean for few months and can consider it as a better option than the original one. It is one of the best alternatives to expensive Braun cartridges. The cartridge rinsing and refilling was extremely easy and I had a smooth experience in each time I used it for refilling. Its pleasant smell is icing on the  cake. I highly recommend this product to everyone who uses Braun cleaning cartridges.</li>
    <li> Whoever is reading this is probably sick of paying Braun&#x27;s outrageous prices. Also, if you are anything like me, you are not comfortable with the environmentally wasteful Braun cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit wary of using a water based solution that intentionally leaves the shaver wet. However, the extra lubricants really do make for a smoother shave. I love that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rinsing the used cartridge was a snap. Excellent directions were provided with the shipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the fragrance. It is pleasant without being overbearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning is just the same as the Braun cartridge and the shaver performs great.</li>
    <li> In 2012 their formula container denatured alcohol,  then switched to vinegar, then to isopropyl alcohol without updating their website until a customer pointed out the label discrepancy.  Stay away from this product until poor unsuspecting customers start coming in with positive reviews.  Sure we want to save money but they need to come clean about what you are getting.  Obviously complaints forced the reformulations and I&#x27;m not anxious to be part of their experimenting.  I bought the 2012 formulation and it never worked in my Braun cleaner.  The specific gravity or conductivity must be off because it just ran and ran without showing a better clean reading.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a week now.  Cleaning out the Braun cartridge using the instructions provided just took a minute. As is mentioned elsewhere this product is really better off using while it is still wet.  I&#x27;ve been hitting the clean cycle just before I shave. Sometimes if the razor is already clean I just run it for a few seconds to wet the shaver. Not that you can&#x27;t use it dry just that it works well wet. Nice part is I can now shave right out of the shower. I don&#x27;t even have to wait for my face to be completely dry like used to do. Subjective but I like the citrus tree scent. The product also seems to do a fine job cleaning the razor.  I love that it is much cheaper than the Braun cartridges and I like that I feel like I&#x27;m disposing of less plastic. Throwing out the fancy Braun cartridge each time just to get more fluid always seemed like a such a waste.</li>
    <li> Great price and cleans my braun shaver as good as original,also smells great,also was very quick shipping,seems to last in braun holding unit longer</li>
    <li> The savings are obvious, the cleaning is great and the shave is smooth. I like to support a Made In USA product and if you&#x27;re a tree hugger, I guess you&#x27;d appreciate the environmental benefits, yada, yada, yada.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suck it Braun.</li>
    <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t work att all.  Open my razor head today after a few weeks of daily cleaning.  Full of stubble and skin particles. When I used the original cleaner, the gead was spotless. Also, it doesn&#x27;t smell like citrus once it&#x27;s used.</li>
    <li> Seems to work as advertised.  Issues with opening the package per the instructions.  Just snip the corner and gently squeeze into container.</li>
    <li> Not sure I like it. The original solvent is Methanol, this is Isopropinol. There is an yellow oily deposit on the shaver</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t find washing the Braun cartridges out difficult.  The issue for me is that this product just doesn&#x27;t clean the razor as well as the Braun formula does.  After a couple of weeks of daily cleanings with the Shaver Shebang stuff, there was clearly gunk (for lack of a better word) accumulating under the razor head.  It&#x27;s not bad; it smells good; it just doesn&#x27;t clean as well.  I&#x27;m keeping it around just in case I find myself without a usable filled Braun cartridge temporarily, but it&#x27;s a substitute.</li>
