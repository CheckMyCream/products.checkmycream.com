### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I switched to Revlon Colorstay and am very happy.</li>
      <li>Very good, would recommend.  </li>
      <li>THIS eyeliner has great color</li>
      <li>This does all of those at a great cost.</li>
      <li>This product is great for lining the waterline.</li>
      <li>Bought this because of a write up in some magazine and how perfect the colour is for your eyes and how easy it is to go on blah blah blah.  </li>
      <li>It stays on all day, doesn&#x27;t smear and is a good color.  </li>
      <li>i love it and it is a great product in its category</li>
      <li>(A great price with S&amp;S, better than I can find in the drugstore.)</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>This is my favorite eye pencil, when it&#x27;s fresh - it&#x27;s great!</li>
      <li>With good color pay off comes easy smudging</li>
      <li>but the color is great and it stays on pretty well.</li>
      <li>and  I love how it looks on me.  </li>
      <li>Pleased.</li>
      <li>Love this eye liner.</li>
      <li>I get cheaper and better pencils from the Jordanna line.</li>
      <li>I decided to try this cream pencil liner and LOVE it.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply.</li>
      <li>The liner applies easily and lasts throughout the day.</li>
      <li>goes on smooth.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t glide as smoothly as I thought it would</li>
      <li>One good thing is that it seems to last all day.</li>
      <li>My old eyeliner was MAC, but this goes on much more smoothly and doesn&#x27;t need sharpening, so it lasts longer.</li>
      <li>At my age I want an eyeliner that glides on smoothly, delivers consistent color and doesn&#x27;t tug at my eyelids.</li>
      <li>The vibrant violet is a little too bright purple for me, I like revlons blackberry color better.</li>
      <li>I was surprised that it&#x27;s actually better than some of the higher end products</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a high school teacher, so I&#x27;m not running around too much but still need to reapply and it does smudge somewhat easily if you touch your eyes.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply and does not mess up.</li>
      <li>The color is pretty though</li>
      <li>a stay-put formula, glides easily yet does not smudge as my Urban Decay&#x27;s does ,which is so annoying!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>Finally after examining my lenses I noticed that the residue on them was silver with a bit of fine glitter in it.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>This eyeliner didn&#x27;t stay on very well.  </li>
      <li>It ran out way too fast.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>I have worn contacts most of my life and have NEVER had a problem with any other makeup until yesterday.</li>
      <li>It literally glides on, no tugging or pulling, and is much easier than a normal pencil.</li>
      <li>Only after I washed all of the eyeliner off of my eyes and put my contacts back in was I able to see clearly for the rest of my work night.</li>
      <li>Overall, it was worth the try.</li>
      <li>Like the liquid, it looks bold and is easy to do different styles, but not as messy.</li>
      <li>this is one of the few eyeliners that is easy to wear, is vibrant and doesn&#x27;t smudge or fades with  time.</li>
      <li>This is for the Bold Brown color which is a dark brown not a weak brown</li>
      <li>At first it did go on pretty smoothly but after a little while it became harder to apply.</li>
      <li>I was actually at work bartending last night and had to go to the bathroom every hour to pop out my contacts and clean them.</li>
      <li>I find that brown liner looks much more natural than black, and this does what a liner is meant to do, emphasize the lashes and make eyes seem bigger and brighter without looking like you&#x27;ve drawn a line across your lids.</li>
      <li>I have been using revlon&#x27;s colorstay eyeliner (blackberry and coca brown) for years and was satisfied with it because it stays on well without smudging but is slightly hard to apply.</li>
      <li>far, the cream eyeliner is a happy medium between the hard pencil and messy liquid.</li>
      <li>Have to apply several times until the color really appears.</li>
      <li>I bought this pencil thinking that it would create some natural eye line, but it does not.</li>
      <li>Like the pencil, it isn&#x27;t messy, but it glides on much easier and most importantly, you don&#x27;t have to press down hard on your eye for it to work.</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s barely there.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m an old lady and this product did not last a week!!  </li>
      <li>It goes on as just about any other eyeliner does, but it does need to be reapplied at least once (usually twice) throughout the day to look great.</li>
      <li>If you are looking to coat the rims of your eyes in a super thick coating of liner, this is for you.</li>

<li> I normally use black eyeliner, but I wanted to try something different.  </li>
<li> Lasts a long time.</li>
<li> Stays on a little bit longer than regular pencil, but the tube doesn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
<li> But The item received from amazon - was totally dry.</li>
<li> The other times I was struggling to see what was going on (filling drinks, counting money, bussing, etc) and to work without making a complete mess.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s endurance was average; it didn&#x27;t last the day.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m actually going to use this brown liner instead of black from now on.  </li>
<li> I thought I ordered this in black, but brown ended up suiting my blue eyes just as well.</li>
<li> The color was a bit darker than I expected</li>
<li> I have tried a lot of other brown eyeliners and they just had no color.  </li>
<li> The regular pencils are often too sharp and you have to press down hard on your eye to get it to work, and the liquid eyeliners are messy and</li>
<li> But this is not for my everyday makeup kit.</li>
<li> I think the fact that I had high expectations for this eyeliner made it a little disappointing when I tried it out.</li>
<li> Clumpy, not easy to blend.  </li>
<li> one has faint specs of shimmer like my Urban Decay</li>
<li> I just usually have to apply it after curling my eyelashes because it tends to smudge onto the eyelash curler if I do it before .</li>
<li> I want subtle and that is what I got.</li>
<li> You can easily do a thin line or a thick line, depending on what you&#x27;re going for.</li>
<li> It took me a couple disastrous times wearing this eyeliner in \\&quot;Made of Steel\\&quot; to realize that the reason I actually COULD NOT SEE through my contacts was because of a thin layer of this eyeliner that kept coating my contact.</li>
<li> I bought this cream eyeliner in Coal Commander.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eyeliners are a frustrating makeup, in my opinion.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is my favorite eye pencil, when it&#x27;s fresh - it&#x27;s great! But The item received from amazon - was totally dry. the seller refunded me, but still.. I found its production date, and it was produced in 2011 (it&#x27;s 2015 now.)</li>
    <li> Love this eye liner. On lily skin, it still smears eventually...but I use she shadow primer to help combat the smear.</li>
    <li> This is for the Bold Brown color which is a dark brown not a weak brown that&#x27;s barely there.&lt;br /&gt;Its a stay-put formula, glides easily yet does not smudge as my Urban Decay&#x27;s does ,which is so annoying!&lt;br /&gt;This one has faint specs of shimmer like my Urban Decay does yet this liner costs 50% less.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend you buy</li>
    <li> It took me a couple disastrous times wearing this eyeliner in \\&quot;Made of Steel\\&quot; to realize that the reason I actually COULD NOT SEE through my contacts was because of a thin layer of this eyeliner that kept coating my contact. I was actually at work bartending last night and had to go to the bathroom every hour to pop out my contacts and clean them. The other times I was struggling to see what was going on (filling drinks, counting money, bussing, etc) and to work without making a complete mess. Finally after examining my lenses I noticed that the residue on them was silver with a bit of fine glitter in it. Only after I washed all of the eyeliner off of my eyes and put my contacts back in was I able to see clearly for the rest of my work night. What a pain in the butt!!! I have worn contacts most of my life and have NEVER had a problem with any other makeup until yesterday. Just wanted to put it out there since this product is labeled \\&quot;contact lens safe.\\&quot; It just ISN&#x27;T!</li>
    <li> I think the fact that I had high expectations for this eyeliner made it a little disappointing when I tried it out. At first it did go on pretty smoothly but after a little while it became harder to apply. The color was a bit darker than I expected but it&#x27;s not a big deal. One good thing is that it seems to last all day. I just usually have to apply it after curling my eyelashes because it tends to smudge onto the eyelash curler if I do it before . I&#x27;ll still use it until it runs out but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying it again. Overall, it was worth the try.</li>
    <li> I have been using revlon&#x27;s colorstay eyeliner (blackberry and coca brown) for years and was satisfied with it because it stays on well without smudging but is slightly hard to apply. I decided to try this cream pencil liner and LOVE it. It stays on forever, goes on easier, and the bold brown has a subtle hint of gold sparkle, which I like. The vibrant violet is a little too bright purple for me, I like revlons blackberry color better.</li>
    <li> Clumpy, not easy to blend.  If you are looking to coat the rims of your eyes in a super thick coating of liner, this is for you.</li>
    <li> Lasts a long time. goes on smooth. I was surprised that it&#x27;s actually better than some of the higher end products</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m an old lady and this product did not last a week!!  I only apply on my bottom lid.  It ran out way too fast.  I would not purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Very good, would recommend.  Easy to apply.</li>
    <li> Have to apply several times until the color really appears. The color is pretty though</li>
    <li> With good color pay off comes easy smudging</li>
    <li> I thought I ordered this in black, but brown ended up suiting my blue eyes just as well. This product is great for lining the waterline. It literally glides on, no tugging or pulling, and is much easier than a normal pencil. Highly recommend!</li>

I&#x27;m a high school teacher, so I&#x27;m not running around too much but still need to reapply and it does smudge somewhat easily if you touch your eyes.</li>
    <li> This pencil contains some pearl in it, which I did not expect at all. I bought this pencil thinking that it would create some natural eye line, but it does not. If you want a party look, go for it. But this is not for my everyday makeup kit.</li>
    <li> I find that brown liner looks much more natural than black, and this does what a liner is meant to do, emphasize the lashes and make eyes seem bigger and brighter without looking like you&#x27;ve drawn a line across your lids.

    <li> Bought this because of a write up in some magazine and how perfect the colour is for your eyes and how easy it is to go on blah blah blah.  It lived up to NONE of my expectations.  I get cheaper and better pencils from the Jordanna line.</li>
    <li> I bought this cream eyeliner in Coal Commander.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eyeliners are a frustrating makeup, in my opinion.

Also, it lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend a cream eyeliner.</li>
