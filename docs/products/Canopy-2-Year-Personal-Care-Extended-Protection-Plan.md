<li> what a waste - only kicks in AFTER the mfg warranty of 2 years.</li>
<li> The warrantee terms were received, and they were in such small letters that they are unreadable.  </li>
<li> This warranty is not worth the $11 for 2 years.</li>
<li> Might be a cheaper warranty, but it&#x27;s not worth a cent.</li>
<li> I understood that to mean beyond the initial coverage period provided by the seller.  </li>

    <li> Because it&#x27;s a protection plan, I have not had to use it since I just received the product. in the pass they have been great</li>
    <li> Great product, delivered ahead of schedule.</li>
    <li> The warrantee terms were received, and they were in such small letters that they are unreadable.  WTH</li>
    <li> Hope I don&#x27;t have to use it.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had to use this yet...and hope won&#x27;t have to, but the peace of mind the item is protected is worth the price.  Have read good reviews about this coverage.</li>
    <li> will let everyone know if and when i use it</li>
    <li> My fit bit is not working correctly will not hold a long charge</li>
    <li> I bought this to go with the Fitbit which was a gift for my daughter.</li>
    <li> Worth the few extra dollars</li>
    <li> Better protect my stuff</li>
    <li> Everything I read says this &#x27;extended warranty&#x27; would start AFTER the manufacturer warranty expires !! But of course this has listed it&#x27;s start date as the PURCHASE date.  Shame on Amazon for allowing this.</li>
    <li> This seems to be a pretty good warantyI have not had to use but I have friends who have .</li>
    <li> great seller, great product</li>
    <li> Easy to add and nice policy.</li>
    <li> Tried to file a claim on Canopy Protection for the FitBit Hr that stopped syncing and comes up with error messages; but Canopy Protection is now saying that after 4 months,(this is a 2 year plan), that this FitBit Hr watch is no longer returnable under the manufacturer&#x27;s warranty? I am not requesting a return. I would like a fixed FitBit HR. This warranty is not worth the $11 for 2 years.</li>
    <li> what a waste - only kicks in AFTER the mfg warranty of 2 years. Don&#x27;t bother with this</li>
    <li> Very good exactly what I wanted</li>
    <li> $99.00 on special. How can you beat it! Great gift idea. Watch for specials on Amazon as I saved over $50.00.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s better than they say, outstanding.....</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t need until warranty runs out</li>
    <li> I have not received my razor yet and your coverage has started.  When I ordered it and your coverage, you advertised that it was two years of ADDITIONAL coverage.  I understood that to mean beyond the initial coverage period provided by the seller.  What I have now is coverage that is in effect at the same time my original coverage is in effect.......that does not make sense.  Even your logo to the left of this box says &amp;#34;extended&amp;#34;.  Have you taken poetic license to redefine &amp;#34;extended&amp;#34; to mean simultaneous?</li>
    <li> Well worth the price!</li>
    <li> Too early to tell yet if this is a good buy or not. I purchased this protection plan for a FITBT I just purchased.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem right the coverage starts the day I ordered the product and not the day I RECEIVE the product.</li>
    <li> Have extra protection is always great. It is that rare time when you send money on something in hopes that you will not need it.</li>
    <li> Glad I got the extended warranty!</li>
    <li> Bought this and needed it for the product I bought it for, only to experience more hassle than needed. I tried contacting them twice without any help. Might be a cheaper warranty, but it&#x27;s not worth a cent.</li>
    <li> It is alright, The Regestering is not the best, their online tool didnt reconize my product, but allowed for an other option and user input.</li>
    <li> Glad to have this for my fitbit charger Hr. I&#x27;m glad that I have protect my this little expensive gadget.</li>
