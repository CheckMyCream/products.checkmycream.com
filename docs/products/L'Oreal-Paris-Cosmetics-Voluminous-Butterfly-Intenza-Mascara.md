      <li>I really love this mascara and have tried so many brands over the years.  </li>
      <li>I am a mascara fanatic - always looking for a great product at a great price!</li>
      <li>It also interestingly has an almost floral aroma when you apply it.</li>
      <li>Better than most, but not the one...</li>
      <li>There are two sets of short bristles that are excellent for basic application, and two sets of longer, flared out bristles that help lengthen and separate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two setbacks that I can think of: 1) I have noticed this formula is not the best at helping to keep a curl in my lashes.</li>
      <li>I love the applicator.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t feel this product worked to lengthen my lashes, I got better results with revlon.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t seem to have as many lashes and</li>
      <li>Love mascara</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>This one definitely is better than most.  </li>
      <li>I use this with my lash primer (Dior Show) and top it off with this</li>
      <li>Goes on nicely and it doesn&#x27;t rip out your eyelashes to get off like some of the more high end brands!</li>
      <li>Washes off easily.  </li>
      <li>Wow - this product really does plump up your lashes great!  </li>
      <li>It goes on easily</li>
      <li>the brush did nothing for my lashes...and the formula bleeds easily  </li>
      <li>No clumps, easy application, inexpensive.</li>
      <li>It has a really strong fragrance.</li>
      <li>(suffice it to say a LONG time, lol).  </li>
      <li>this products really highlight them and makes them stand out-clump free and smudge free!  </li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly with no clumps and it&#x27;s best to reapply at least twice to lengthen and thicken the eyelashes.  </li>
      <li>Love it except I REALLY wish I had gotten the waterproof one bc</li>
      <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
      <li>Recently, I&#x27;ve been using their Rocket formula but have not been totally happy with it because it doesn&#x27;t deliver much volume.  </li>
      <li>Arrive as expected, packaging was good.</li>
      <li>The brush comes out clean and delivers just the right amount of product and builds nice volume with a few coats.  </li>
      <li>For many years, I&#x27;ve only used Maybelline mascaras.  </li>
      <li>Great little product here, iif you love big eyelashes, long lashes, then this is the proeduct for you .</li>
      <li>I would always find it hard to find a good mascara that not only gives a good coat to my lashes, but also makes my lashes look absolutely long and voluminous...</li>
      <li>Hard to find a good mascara</li>
      <li>When I twist it while going to the tips it really adds volume and length.</li>
      <li>After that I apply this mascara and it really fans out my lashes.</li>
      <li>This product was really flaky.  </li>
      <li>I really wish this mascara lengthened but no luck.</li>
      <li>Really like this one as well.</li>
      <li>It make my lashes look much fuller,</li>
      <li>All in all, I really like it and would purchase it again.  </li>
      <li>I have very short and light colored lashes.</li>
      <li>I was a bit put off by the unusual brush shape, it seemed like it would invite clumps (my pet peeve).  </li>
      <li>The brush is what really sets this mascara apart though.</li>
      <li>It does not really bother my eyes much, but more than others I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
      <li>Now that I am getting older</li>
      <li>It creates a middle ground between super glam and natural, definitely my go to!</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t help too much with making you look like you have a lot of lashes, but it definitely emphasizes volume while still looking natural.</li>
      <li>The butterfly applicator is smaller and much easier to get in the corners of the eye.  </li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised how well it fanned out my lashes.</li>
      <li>But I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
      <li>It is pretty intense in black color as well.</li>
      <li>After a few hours I sometimes notice some mild flaking action under my eyes.</li>
      <li>but it does take a little more work than the other L&#x27;Oreal I was using.  </li>
      <li>The nice thing about that is that it comes off easily at night, the bad thing is that you have to be careful of raccoon eyes if you&#x27;re sweating a lot while wearing it.</li>
      <li>I applied several coats and got results comparable to my old Maybelline formula.  </li>
      <li>All in all, I like it a little better than my previous mascara and have my daughter-in-law to thank for buying it for me.  </li>
      <li>I have been using one of L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s other butterfly applicator mascaras but this one is much nicer.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Better than most, but not the one...I&#x27;ll keep on searching.</li>
    <li> For many years, I&#x27;ve only used Maybelline mascaras.  Twice they have discontinued a formula I&#x27;ve grown used to and loved.  This is very frustrating of course.  Recently, I&#x27;ve been using their Rocket formula but have not been totally happy with it because it doesn&#x27;t deliver much volume.  I&#x27;m at an age where my lashes have become thinner and therefore I need all the volume possible, although my lashes are still quite long.  At Christmastime, I received this Loreal mascara in my stocking.  I was skeptical about trying it, believing that Maybelline would reign supreme like they had for all the years I&#x27;ve been using mascara (too many to count).  I was a bit put off by the unusual brush shape, it seemed like it would invite clumps (my pet peeve).  But I was pleasantly surprised.  This mascara delivered nice volume and no clumps and I was happy to discover that it was buildable too.  I applied several coats and got results comparable to my old Maybelline formula.  It didn&#x27;t smudge or smear (if I had bought it myself I would have purchased the waterproof formula), which was a very good thing.  All in all, I like it a little better than my previous mascara and have my daughter-in-law to thank for buying it for me.  Yes, the brush is a bit weird and it takes a few minutes to get the hang of it, but ultimately it works.  The brush comes out clean and delivers just the right amount of product and builds nice volume with a few coats.  All in all, I really like it and would purchase it again.  This is a big revelation for me since I&#x27;ve been a Maybelline mascara customer since I was in my teens (suffice it to say a LONG time, lol).  I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST mascara that I have used in years! I would always find it hard to find a good mascara that not only gives a good coat to my lashes, but also makes my lashes look absolutely long and voluminous...this mascara does all of that and I&#x27;m extremely happy with this great find :)</li>
    <li> I was disappointed that I found after using it mulit-times, it clumped when applying. It did extend the lashes wonderfully well but had to throw away.</li>
    <li> Great little product here, iif you love big eyelashes, long lashes, then this is the proeduct for you . It comes in the colors of black , blackest black , and I believe it is  a medium black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This I bought from the Amazon store,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you want to be a butterfly, then try thr L&#x27;Oreal Paris Voluminous Mascara .</li>
    <li> I was looking for a reliable drugstore brand of mascara and gave the L&#x27;Oreal Paris Voluminous Butterfly Intenza Mascara a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like mascaras that are dark black, separate/define my lashes, and have some lengthening as well. This mascara does all of that. It also interestingly has an almost floral aroma when you apply it. The brush is what really sets this mascara apart though. There are two sets of short bristles that are excellent for basic application, and two sets of longer, flared out bristles that help lengthen and separate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two setbacks that I can think of: 1) I have noticed this formula is not the best at helping to keep a curl in my lashes. 2) After a few hours I sometimes notice some mild flaking action under my eyes. It&#x27;s nothing terrible, but it doesn&#x27;t require touch ups, and I typically prefer a less high maintenance mascara as far as flaking/reapplications are concerned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even with those setbacks, I like the benefits enough that I&#x27;d buy this again.</li>
    <li> Great mascara--definitely not water/sweat proof though. The nice thing about that is that it comes off easily at night, the bad thing is that you have to be careful of raccoon eyes if you&#x27;re sweating a lot while wearing it. Overall, it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> Really liked the butterfly mascara. Really like this one as well. It fns out my eyelashes and adds length without clumps on one coat. I get a lot of compliments. I will try to add a picture.</li>
    <li> Best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used!!! Absoulty amazing! Works like something you would pay 50$ for!!!</li>
    <li> Very good but not as hypoallergenic as others.  It does not really bother my eyes much, but more than others I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t feel this product worked to lengthen my lashes, I got better results with revlon.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Gives an amazing volume and color.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this mascara! I am so glad that I tried it out! My lashes can be difficult sometimes as they are not the most voluminous, thick or naturally curled. I use this with my lash primer (Dior Show) and top it off with this and my lashes are amazing.Definitely a very nice butterfly effect, they are fanned out and look AMAZING! I would definitely recommend this to others. It creates a middle ground between super glam and natural, definitely my go to! It is pretty intense in black color as well. Love it!</li>
    <li> Its difficult to put the applicator back into the base.  Don&#x27;t care for that.</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t buy again.  Constant flakes of mascara below my eyes. Messy.</li>
    <li> Goes on nicely and it doesn&#x27;t rip out your eyelashes to get off like some of the more high end brands!</li>
    <li> I have been using one of L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s other butterfly applicator mascaras but this one is much nicer.  The butterfly applicator is smaller and much easier to get in the corners of the eye.  It goes on smoothly with no clumps and it&#x27;s best to reapply at least twice to lengthen and thicken the eyelashes.  I use olive oil to remove my makeup at night.  This mascara does come off using the olive oil but it does take a little more work than the other L&#x27;Oreal I was using.  I love the applicator.</li>
    <li> This product was really flaky.  It just did not stay on my lashes and gave me raccoon eyes.</li>
    <li> I am not a person that wears make-up but I wanted to start wearing mascara because my lashes are all over the place at times. This mascara is amazing. It make my lashes look much fuller, no clumping. It&#x27;s very easy to use. I have already purchased another and just bought the current one 2 weeks ago. (I purchased another to have it on hand, not because I have run out. I don&#x27;t use it every day.)</li>
    <li> Applying the product makes my lashes look naturally long. It doesn&#x27;t help too much with making you look like you have a lot of lashes, but it definitely emphasizes volume while still looking natural.</li>
    <li> I really love this mascara and have tried so many brands over the years.  This one definitely is better than most.  Lashes look longer and thicker.  Washes off easily.  I will buy again!</li>
    <li> Clumps up. Used it only once.</li>
    <li> Does the job but I think the best mascara is Clinique&#x27;s waterproof mascara. Best ever. This is a cheaper route.</li>
    <li> No clumps, easy application, inexpensive.</li>
    <li> Arrive as expected, packaging was good. Love mascara and this is awesome. Really gives volume on my lashes, not too thick...i like the consistency of the product. Easy to apply, great quality.</li>
    <li> Just tried this mascara today.  It clumped up after the 3rd coat.  Two coats just didn&#x27;t look thick enough.  I really wish this mascara lengthened but no luck.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised how well it fanned out my lashes. I just wish it went on a tiny bit thicker.</li>
    <li> Not really working for me.</li>
    <li> Love it except I REALLY wish I had gotten the waterproof one bc this style flakes off through out the day.</li>
    <li> It has a really strong fragrance. The brush isn&#x27;t great...lots of clumps.</li>
    <li> While I didn&#x27;t purchase on here, it&#x27;s an amazing product and I&#x27;m 53 and now my eyes POP!  Love it.</li>
    <li> Wow - this product really does plump up your lashes great!  Now that I am getting older I don&#x27;t seem to have as many lashes and this products really highlight them and makes them stand out-clump free and smudge free!  I would recommend this mascara! I received this item at a discounted rate in exchange for my unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Great mascara - You will not be dissappointed . I am a mascara fanatic - always looking for a great product at a great price! This fits the bill! Buy it!</li>
    <li> I have very short and light colored lashes. I start out by using a curler. After that I apply this mascara and it really fans out my lashes. When I twist it while going to the tips it really adds volume and length. It makes my lashes look 5x longer and fuller. The only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars and not five is I feel that sometimes the product starts flaking off tiny bit since I find black flakes on my cheek late on in the day.</li>
    <li> Hard to find a good mascara and this is working well...</li>
    <li> I bought this because I saw it in a magazine as one of the best new mascaras to try.  I have LOVED it.  It goes on easily (I put two coats on), stays on ALL day and doesn&#x27;t smudge.  It makes my eyelashes look longer and darker.  I will definitely be buying again.</li>
    <li> It looks great, but does begin to flake after time.</li>
    <li> ehn... I guess you get what you pay for ...i have short , lame lashes... the brush did nothing for my lashes...and the formula bleeds easily  ( now I do have oily skin as Ive stated in a review for Blinc&#x27;s mascara.. so I find a lot of mascaras give me raccoon eyes at the end of the day. Anywas I would not recommend this.. Loreal has some good mascara&#x27;s but this isnt&#x27; one of them.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my daughter to put in her Easter basket. She is already a customer. This is her everyday mascara.</li>
