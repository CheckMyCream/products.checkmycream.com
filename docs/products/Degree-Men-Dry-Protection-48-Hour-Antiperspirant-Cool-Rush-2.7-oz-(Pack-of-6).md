      <li>Great scent !  </li>
      <li>The smell of this Adrenaline Series isn&#x27;t the best one but its the best protection that I have tried in a Degree antiperspirant.</li>
      <li>Very good for men,</li>
      <li>Ideal price</li>
      <li>Works great but ditching alum based products</li>
      <li>Its great all day at work and the gym after.  </li>
      <li>Great product with a great fragrance.</li>
      <li>We loved this item and we would recommend this item to anyone.</li>
      <li>The orange colored scent is also a good choice if you come across it.</li>
      <li>Good stuff good price.  </li>
      <li>Yes - Does it smell good?</li>
      <li>, my husband uses it every day, 24 hours protection, good choice for money</li>
      <li>It has a nice, pleasant smell that is not overpowering.</li>
      <li>I love it !</li>
      <li>good suitable packaging</li>
      <li>If you like a very strong scent that will overpower your cologne or act as a cologne; this is for you.</li>
      <li>The deodorant want well, but he smell is very strong.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m hot and nervous all day (lol), so maybe it&#x27;s just the degree &amp;#34;adrenaline&amp;#34; function kicking in.  </li>
      <li>this deodorant does have an moderately strong cologne smell to it all day, kind of like that &amp;#34;fresh linens&amp;#34; smell you&#x27;d get from washing clothes.  </li>
      <li>Adrenaline series deodorant has become my favorite.</li>
      <li>, the more i enjoyed the scent</li>
      <li>but you can see it coming for sure.</li>
      <li>but the more i used it</li>
      <li>This deodorant its very good, is more protective than other Degree deodorants that I&#x27;ve used before but the smell is quite strong as well and not that good.</li>
      <li>It offers a great protection during many hours.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth a look if you&#x27;re searching for an effective product.</li>
      <li>This scent is strong.</li>
      <li>Sometimes you just need a great, lasting product that has a scent that might grow on you</li>
      <li>Fantastic deodorant, always used V12 but switched to this at a cheap subscribe and save, save yourself a ton</li>
      <li>Not a bad deodorant</li>
      <li>It is nice to have this deodorant in your rotation (I have 3 brands open in any given week).</li>
      <li>Definitely worth it.</li>
      <li>Mostly though I buy it because it is on the Subscribe and Save program, and coupons come up for it moderately frequently.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just right, fresh... and it</li>
      <li>, that is if you don&#x27;t like it right away.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure nothing short of liquid cement would shore me</li>
      <li>This was my first time using this product.</li>
      <li>and i found it does work very well for wetness protection</li>
      <li>I will be using this more in the near future.</li>
      <li>I actually bought one of three different scents and love them all.</li>
      <li>A decent price for a 2 pack.</li>
      <li>it seems to be effective at preventing &amp;#34;the smell&amp;#34; (I&#x27;m a nervous sweater), from 8AM till at least 10 or 11PM.  </li>
      <li>However, it should be just as great as other Degree products used in the past.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s gentle on the skin, but still strong enough to keep me dry all day.  </li>
      <li>I will give the other one away (2 pack) and use this for those special occasions.</li>
      <li>When i first got this deodorant, i would of described the scent as less of an extreme adventure, but more like sitting in your yard smelling the citronella candle burning on the picnic table in front of you...</li>
      <li>Works really well, discovered it in New York one year when working on US Open.</li>
      <li>As I said, we all have different tastes but this is surely not a subtle scent for us guys.</li>
      <li>Degree is the first deodorant/anti perspirant that I have purchased that gives you long lasting odor and sweat protection.</li>
      <li>I am a fat man who works in a very warm area, and when I use this, I don&#x27;t smell that bad at the end of the day.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not going to be too negative because a scent is unique to each person.</li>

    <li> I am certainly no pit-stick aficionado, but this stuff works for me.  I am a fat man who works in a very warm area, and when I use this, I don&#x27;t smell that bad at the end of the day.  Heck, I&#x27;ve even been complemented on the smell of this stuff once or twice.  Mostly though I buy it because it is on the Subscribe and Save program, and coupons come up for it moderately frequently.</li>
    <li> Been using for a few years now.  Its great all day at work and the gym after.  No smell.  No sweat.</li>
    <li> Good stuff good price.  Degree keeps musty pit away.</li>
    <li> Leaves those white marks on your clothes</li>
    <li> Excellent product &amp; seller!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not going to be too negative because a scent is unique to each person. This scent is strong. It&#x27;s industrial to me and my G/F. It isn&#x27;t horrible but you can see it coming for sure. I will give the other one away (2 pack) and use this for those special occasions. If you like a very strong scent that will overpower your cologne or act as a cologne; this is for you. As I said, we all have different tastes but this is surely not a subtle scent for us guys.</li>
    <li> When i first got this deodorant, i would of described the scent as less of an extreme adventure, but more like sitting in your yard smelling the citronella candle burning on the picnic table in front of you...but the more i used it, the more i enjoyed the scent and i found it does work very well for wetness protection and it did last all day, and often into the next. So maybe, being &amp;#34;extreme&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t all that it&#x27;s cracked up to be. Sometimes you just need a great, lasting product that has a scent that might grow on you, that is if you don&#x27;t like it right away.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sensitive to things in the weirdest way and tend to stick faithfully to anything which remotely works.  I like this Degree Deodorant - it seems to be effective at preventing &amp;#34;the smell&amp;#34; (I&#x27;m a nervous sweater), from 8AM till at least 10 or 11PM.  It does nothing for me as an antiperspirant, but honestly I&#x27;ve never found anything that does.... I&#x27;m sure nothing short of liquid cement would shore me up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One comment - this deodorant does have an moderately strong cologne smell to it all day, kind of like that &amp;#34;fresh linens&amp;#34; smell you&#x27;d get from washing clothes.  Some people like that - I don&#x27;t mind it.  I&#x27;m hot and nervous all day (lol), so maybe it&#x27;s just the degree &amp;#34;adrenaline&amp;#34; function kicking in.  It will compete with any other smells you try to wear.</li>
    <li> This was my first time using this product. It seemed to work about the same as my usual brand that I use.</li>
    <li> Wife likes the smell and it does the job too</li>
    <li> I like the smell and it&#x27;s long-lasting effect (one 24-hr period is assured). This dark blue variant is probably the strongest in terms of  intensity of fragrance compared with the others in the &#x27;Adrenaline&#x27; series, but it is not that overpowering. It is nice to have this deodorant in your rotation (I have 3 brands open in any given week).</li>
    <li> The smell is not overwhelming. It&#x27;s just right, fresh... and it&lt;br /&gt;lasts for a very long time. Definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> Adrenaline series deodorant has become my favorite. The orange colored scent is also a good choice if you come across it.</li>
    <li> This deodorant its very good, is more protective than other Degree deodorants that I&#x27;ve used before but the smell is quite strong as well and not that good.</li>
    <li> Great product with a great fragrance.</li>
    <li> This product is one of my two go-to products.  My skin is very sensitive, and many antiperspirants give me a very painful rash after just one or two days use.  Degree is one of the few that I can use for several days in a row before I have to switch brands.  I always have two antiperspirant sticks open at any given time, and this is one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s gentle on the skin, but still strong enough to keep me dry all day.  Definitely worth a look if you&#x27;re searching for an effective product.</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY HUSBAND BECAUSE I NOTICED HIS REGULAR DEODORANT WAS NOT DOING THE JOB IT ONCE DID....HE IS PHYSICALLY ACTIVE AND HE CAME HOME WITH ALOT OF BODY ODOR...YAY ITS WORKING...ITS A 4 STAR BECAUSE ITS DIFFICULT TO FIND</li>
    <li> Deodorant does what it is expected to do.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time and as described.</li>
    <li> Item is not yet used, hence cannot comment on the scent etc., However, it should be just as great as other Degree products used in the past.  Ideal price</li>
    <li> Degree is the first deodorant/anti perspirant that I have purchased that gives you long lasting odor and sweat protection. Put it on once in the morning and it lasts all day.  I now use this brand and nothing else. A decent price for a 2 pack.</li>
    <li> Not a bad deodorant but I don&#x27;t think it lasts 48 hours at all.</li>
    <li> Very good for men, good suitable packaging, my husband uses it every day, 24 hours protection, good choice for money</li>
    <li> Works all day as anyone would expect deodorant to do. It has a nice, pleasant smell that is not overpowering. I actually bought one of three different scents and love them all.</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s there to say, did to keep me adequately dry? Yes - Does it smell good? Yes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;again it&#x27;s just deodorant..</li>
    <li> Great scent !  I love it !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in the military and I use this deodorant everyday before work and it holds up. It definitely gets a thumbs up from me.</li>
    <li> We loved this item and we would recommend this item to anyone. I will be using this more in the near future.</li>
    <li> The deodorant want well, but he smell is very strong.  Even after I washed my husband&#x27;s shirts, I could still smell it.</li>
    <li> Works really well, discovered it in New York one year when working on US Open. Wish I could buy it here</li>
    <li> Works great but ditching alum based products</li>
    <li> In my home country, Venezuela, this brad of antiperspirant isn&#x27;t sold so I buy them in the US. This brand is my preferred one. It offers a great protection during many hours. The smell of this Adrenaline Series isn&#x27;t the best one but its the best protection that I have tried in a Degree antiperspirant.</li>
    <li> Fantastic deodorant, always used V12 but switched to this at a cheap subscribe and save, save yourself a ton</li>
