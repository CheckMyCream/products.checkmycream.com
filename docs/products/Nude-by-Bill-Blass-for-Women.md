<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Absolutely love this product.  Everyone ask about it when I wear it. Unusual yet great scent.  Very feminine.  Recommend as a gift.</li>
    <li> I was pleased with this item I really love the item that I purchased so if you need a cove for your iphone this is the place to order it from.</li>
    <li> it smells wonderful an clean on me an I have always liked Bill Blast perfume  an cologne.I would recommend this product</li>
    <li> I Loved that this item can no longer be found in stores but was easy to purchase  off Amazon.com.  I ordered two and one came without the cap on it...oh well.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for this perfume for a very long time and have finally found it on Amazon!!  So excited!!  When ever I wore this perfume I would get compliments daily on the sensual scent.  Thank you amazon for carrying Nude by Bill Blast and thank you Bill Blast for this fabulous perfume!!</li>
    <li> Bill Blass personally handed me my first bottle when I worked for the airlines and little did I know this would become my signature scent.  It mixes really well with my body chemistry but lately I have been saving my last bottle for special occasions.  (I have saved some from the original bottle that I received from Mr. Blass and will never throw it out).  Now I have to go online to find this scent as it&#x27;s not around so much anymore.  Thank goodness for the internet and thank goodness for Bill Blass.  Rest in peace and thank you so much for the special gift and for sharing your talents with the world!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really wondering what the hype is about this perfume. It really stinks! It&#x27;s way too strong. If you use more than one spray you&#x27;ll need a gas mask. Yeah. I&#x27;m definitely returning it.</li>
    <li> I have worn Nude by Bill Blass for years and was pleasantly surprised to see that I could still purchase it on Amazaon.com.  I have seasonal allergies and it is the only perfume I can wear all year round that doesn&#x27;t give me a sinus headache.  I also found out that it is as an aphrodisiac for men.  They love it!</li>
    <li> A Bavarian friend wanted me to purchase this item because they couldn&#x27;t get it there. I found that it is no longer being made, so I purchased 2 bottles for them. However, when I tried to send them through the mail, I found that the post office doesn&#x27;t allow perfume to be sent. The only saving grace was that a local person is traveling there and took it with him. At this point, I presume it made it. I won&#x27;t hear from the recipient for a couple of weeks. Hopefully, it wasn&#x27;t a purchase in vain.</li>
    <li> Great price for this product; couldn&#x27;t find anyone else coming close.  Fast shipping too!  Will buy from again!!!</li>
    <li> perfume smelled as it should (was a little concerned because of the heat, but it was only outside in box for about an hour)    pump didn&#x27;t initially work, but I kept messin with it, and it ended up being fine.  i love this cologne...it smells so clean and now my nieces and nephews associate the smell with their aunty carol : )</li>
    <li> I RELY on real user reviews so tonight, I will sit down and try to review as many products as I can.  This is one of those &#x27;not many people know the fragrance but it gets a lot of complements&#x27; fragrance.  I used to be embarrassed to tell people that the name is &amp;#34;Nude&amp;#34; but I&#x27;m over it.  It has a sexy pheromone undertone.  Not top of the line but I don&#x27;t mind.  I have a few other high end designer perfumes but this is a nice change that is obscure, noticeable and complemented.  I wish I could explain the tones in this.  It&#x27;s not floral though.  It&#x27;s not musky.  But the fragrance feels like a warm kind of tone.</li>
    <li> Company was great, I just didn&#x27;t dig the scent as much as I thought I would. Next time, next scent!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this perfume for many years only to have it taken out of stores.  The Amazon way was the only way for me to get my favorite perfume.  Nude by Bill Blass leaves you smelling soft and clean.  I&#x27;ve had people stop me in the stores and ask me what perfume I was wearing.  At first I thought I was wearing to much -- a definite no no!!  I hope Amazon has enough of a supply to last me all my days.</li>
    <li> As a first-time shopper at amazon.com, I was rather wary of how the experience would turn out.  I&#x27;m very happy to report that the items I ordered arrived precisely on time, packaged securely, were brand new(in-the-box)and exactly as I had hoped to receive them.  Adding to my pleasure was the wonderfully low price plus the free shipping!  I could not be more pleased with the experience and will definitely purchase from amazon.com again.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Nude for years.  Love the fragrance.  Always get compliments from people when I wear it.&lt;br /&gt;A reasonable price also.</li>
    <li> Bill Blass Nude is a wonderful fragrance I used for many years before trying others, usually gifts. When someone mentioned they&#x27;d always liked Nude on me, I tried to find it in stores where I had previously purchased it. No luck. Then someone mentioned amazon.com, and there it was! I ordered 2, one for me and one for my daughter-in-law. We both love the cologne, and our husbands do, too. A couple of spritzes last a long time. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll ever be able to find it again, but I&#x27;m enjoying it while it lasts.</li>
    <li> Old, smelled like scented rubbing alcohol. I know this cologne--bought since the 90&#x27;s. VERY, VERY dissapointed with what I received.  I will never buy this from you again. Wondered how long it&#x27;s been sitting on the shelf, or if it&#x27;s a fake. Bought two bottles and spent well over $100.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000C1VSXU Nude By Bill Blass For Women. Cologne Spray 3.4 Ounces]] The first time I used this was years ago.  I got it on HSN but after I used it up I could no longer get it.  This has to be at least 10 years or more.  I am so happy to have this back in my life. This smells so good.  As long as amazon carries this I will always have it.</li>
    <li> The best perfume in my life.Soooooooo many compliments.</li>
    <li> My wife will not wear any other cologne except \\&quot;Nude\\&quot;. I typically do not like the excessiveness of most perfumes but this one very soft and easy on the senses.</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume since the 9th grade.  Wore it daily for years.  Only recently have been mixing it up but in my opinion nothing can compete with Nude by Bill Blass.</li>
    <li> This is the only  perfume that I use.  I&#x27;ve been using it for many years and do not ever plan to use anything else.  So many other perfumes that I have tried are so strong that it gives me a headache.  This has a nice soft scent that when combined with your body chemistry will give you your unique scent. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> I have worn Nude for several years...and I was surprised the cost was so much cheaper than when I purchased thru department stores. The odor does not last as long and it does not smell quit the same. I hate to say anything bad about it, because it&#x27;s one of my favorite perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peggy...:(</li>
    <li> What I was looking for.  Came as expected and is the product I was looking for.  Thanks for still carrying it.</li>
    <li> If you like a smell like patchouli, you will like this very much. It doesn&#x27;t smell like that, but it is one of those scents that is unique. Very clean. Not flowery. Not musky.</li>
    <li> This is product is gift for my mother.She is loved it.Thank you very much for your quickly response and shipment.</li>
    <li> its the only perfume I us get tons of people asking me what the name of it is when I am out and about</li>
    <li> I have been searching for this cologne for my mother and you folks have the best deal for the money.  No shipping fee was an added bonus to securing the purchase.  Will check here in the future for other cologne deals.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping! My mom loved the perfume!</li>
    <li> I love it and I get a lot of compliments</li>
    <li> I love Nude.  I have been wearing it for over 10 years and it is the only fragrance I wear.  I try other fragrances, but always come back to this one.  I get so many compliments on it.  And it does not have that overwhelming scent.  It is very light and refreshing.  The price is also very good through Amazon.com.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is the only perfume I wear.  Years ago, I went to a Dillards and tried 30 different perfumes on various locations on my body. The poor people who rode up the elevator with me afterward all died of asphyxiation.   Went home and hours later, picked this one because it went best with my body chemistry, was not overpowering, light and just the right combination of flowers and musk. Got several second opinions from friends and family, as well.       That is the only way to pick a perfume.  Perfumes do NOT smell the same on everyone.  Halston on my best friend smells heavenly, while on me... you would think something had died.     Frequently, someone asks me, \\&quot;What IS that perfume? I love it.\\&quot;  I love the expression on their face when I answer, \\&quot;Nude.\\&quot;  Reactions range from a smile and a comment like, \\&quot;Really!\\&quot;  to a full body blush.  I will never forget the waiter who came up to me in a restaurant and said, \\&quot;That&#x27;s Nude, isn&#x27;t it?\\&quot;  The person with me had no idea what the waiter was talking about, and sincerely wondered about my reputation.      Nude is not sold in stores much any more. It went from being sold at Dillards and Macy&#x27;s to Drug Emporium, then vanished.   I have to order it from Amazon and other online vendors.  I hope that Blass keeps making it, or I will have to start over with the above process of perfume selection.  More people will die.</li>
    <li> Nice perfume, soft &amp; lasting....</li>
    <li> I am known for this scent.  People may not see me but they always comment that I left a hint of my scent when I left a room.  I&#x27;ve never heard a bad thing about it (too strong) but I&#x27;ve been stopped many times by people asking what I&#x27;m wearing.  Love this perfume.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t smell authentic</li>
    <li> Love, love, love it!  The price was excellent.  This has been one of my favorite colognes for years.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;Mary</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product years ago when it was available in stores. It crossed my mind and I looked online to see if anyone still sold it. I was so happy to find it on Amazon.com and at such a decent price, I bought it right away.  I get compliments on how nice I smell when I go out using Bill Blass&#x27;s Nude. Hopefully, it&#x27;s still available on here when I need more.</li>
    <li> Great scent,... Great size!!!... Great Price!!!... Very good. I tell EVERYONE to purchase this product if you love light and airy scents in your perfume.</li>
    <li> I have thoroughly enjoyed Nude by Bill Blass. The fragrance brings back some fond memories. I would definitely recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Very nice soft smell. Doesn&#x27;t seem like you&#x27;re wearing perfume at all.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how these reviewers are but I am a 42 yr old woman and i hate this scent it smells like an old grandma&#x27;s perfume, very powdery but not in a good way. Hated it.</li>
    <li> I used this fragrance 20yrs ago so it was an opportunity to revisit a favorite.  It is still as good as I remember and an even better bargain.</li>
    <li> I LOVE it. The fragrance is fresh and clean. I wear it to work and sometimes on date night. Regardless when I wear it people complemented the smell.</li>
    <li> For a cologne spray it stays with you all day and people have asked me what I was wearing.  Even my husband likes  It really does stay with you and the price is very reasonable.  I will order it again.    I wish I could give it more stars.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with my purchase. I believe my purchase of this perfume was a knock off. I have purchased this perfume online before n I loved it.  This item this time just did not smell like it should n I have to spray alot to have any sent stay on me. Now to top it off the gold top if the perfume bottle is changing colors like the perfume is actually eating away the gold color. This is my favorite perfume and can only purchase it online because it has been discontinued. That is why I bought the bigger bottle this time.....but now how disappointed I am :(.</li>
    <li> I have worn this perfume since 1988.  I cannot wear any other perfume because I am very sensitive to scents and get serious headaches from almost all other perfumes.  I am so happy that Nude has been around for so long and I hope it continues to manufactured.  So many people compliment my signature scent.</li>
    <li> The perfume arrived even earlier than it was promised, carefully packaged. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s long time favourite at a great price. A very underestimated fragrance that is not all that easy to find.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is regal, sexy, and I&#x27;m so glad I asked that lady, &amp;#34;pardon me, what fragrance are you wearing? It smells lovely&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> so happy to find this....pretty good price</li>
    <li> I was incensed!  For 12 years I wore Nude by Bill Blass exclusively.  When I made this purchase I bought two bottles.  When I received it I was shocked beyond belief!!! It was just colored water.  But the worse shock of all was the fact that Amazon was selling it. You don&#x27;t test or check products before you sell them?  Now I am leery of Amazon.</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got it in time for the holidays and got it to her just in time for the surprise!</li>
    <li> Wonderful fragrance. Received item quickly.</li>
    <li> This is the best cologne I have ever had. I buy it all the time. I get compliments where ever I go. Not overpowering. It smells great in warm air. You only need a very small amount so it lasts quite awhile.</li>
    <li> This perfume has a pleasant smell I was expecting it to smell a little stronger and last longer on the body.  This kind of smells like Nude by Rihanna but, Rihanna&#x27;s is alot stronger.</li>
    <li> This is the sexiest smelling fragrance.Though over 20 years old it&#x27;s been my signature fragrance since in my twenties. The best thing about it is the smell last all day long.</li>
    <li> I got this as a birthday of Christmas gift for someone and they said it was their &amp;#34;favorite&amp;#34; cologne ever</li>
    <li> i love Nude and as it is a discontinued item it is getting harder and harder to find.  When it first arrived it smelled a little different but I chalked that up to not having it around for a while.  However after I wore it for a few days, it gave me a rash :-(... Lesson learned</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find this anyplace else and it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> old school smell but I love it, and it came to me very fast, very happy.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance. It is light but last a long time. Always get ask what fragrance are you wearing when i have it on.&lt;br /&gt;Smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance. I have been buying it for many years and everyone loves it. I&#x27;m so glad I can find it here at Amazon!</li>
    <li> I have been using this cologne since the early 90&#x27;s and it is the only cologne I wear that I get compliments off of.  I just simply love it.  It is very light but lasts all day.  Will definitely keep buying.</li>
    <li> The item arrived in good condition and was as advertised.  I am pleased.</li>
    <li> Use of this perfume was quite out of the box for me as I had never used any Bill Blass fragrances.  Very light.  Great for everyday use.</li>
    <li> Love this! Wish they still had the lotion. Always receive compliments even after hours and hours later. So glad I found this on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is a good smelling perfume to me.  I probably will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> Price was great for the product - 65% less than in a nearby retail store.  The fragrance is nice and light.</li>
    <li> My favorite signature perfume.  I get endless compliments when I wear it. People even stop and ask what fragrance I am wearing.</li>
    <li> Very wellsatisfied would recomend to to everyone.My wife and daughter was well satisfied with the colone.Thank you very much.rateing is fine.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance.  It was a gift to me from a friend three years ago and I was so happy when I was able to buy it on line.</li>
    <li> This perfume is excellent for women of any age. This perfume conveys an attitude. It says, I am confident, sexy, sultry, and most of all a lady. It smells a bit strong at first application, but as the day goes the smell becomes intriguing and subtle. One or two spritzes last the whole day!</li>
    <li> Bill Blass Nude opens screeching with aldehydes but then settles into a wonderful skin scent on me ... about 15 minutes to get there, at which point it&#x27;s nearly intoxicating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BB Nude is less nude than Bijan Nude, but it&#x27;s still nude, if that makes any sense. Between Nude and Nude, I initially preferred the Bill Blass Nude because I found a Sophia Grojsman that I can wear on my skin! However, now I prefer Bijan Nude.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s love. However, this fragrance has a role in my wardrobe. I can where it anytime, anywhere when I just want to smell clean and good. I don&#x27;t have to think about it - just grab it, spray it, and go.</li>
    <li> This is one of the only 2 perfumes I wear constantly. It smells SO GOOD! I have people (both sexes) ask me &amp;#34;oh you smell so good!&#x27; all the time when I&#x27;m at work.  A spritz in the morning lasts all day for me. I hate the ones that don&#x27;t last till at least lunch! I hope Bill Blass never stops making this fabulous NUDE perfume!</li>
    <li> I love Bill Blass&#x27; &amp;#34;NUDE&amp;#34; it&#x27;s the only scent that goes with my body chemistry &amp; I&#x27;m so glad you always carry it. Thank you so very much.</li>
    <li> my favorite!In Great Condition!Shipped very fast!!!!</li>
    <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t stick for long.  I&#x27;m questioning if it&#x27;s real or not...</li>
    <li> outstanding service, with a great price, and it is exactly what she wanted!</li>
    <li> Nude by Bill Blass has been my signaturefragrance since 1996.  I&#x27;ve been wearing it for so long that I don&#x27;t even smell it anymore when I put it on.  A little behind the ears and on the pulse point on my neck and I&#x27;m good to go.  Never, ever have I ever worn a scent that garnered more compliments than Nude has for me.  People love it on me!  It&#x27;s just a lovely, sexy fragrance.  However, I would recommend that, before buying it online and if you&#x27;ve never worn it before,  one should go to a department store and try it on first.  Get the opinion of your husband or boyfriend or good friends because fragrances tend to smell differently on different people.  My sister plopped down $40 for a bottle of Nude years ago after smelling it on me.  Her husband told her it smelled awful, LOL (now, mind you, he always complimented me when I had it on).  She ended up giving it to me and going back to what she had used before.</li>
    <li> This deal is awesome! You can&#x27;t find this cologne anywhere. 20 years ago Nude was over $50 a bottle. I get compliments all the time when I wear it!</li>
    <li> I bought Nude and Basic Black, they are both awful.  I wore the originals years ago, loved them.  I can only wear perfumes that the scent smells nice when I first put it on then I don&#x27;t really smell it.  I&#x27;ve noticed expensive perfumes by Bill Blass are that way, these reek all day and give me a headache. I don&#x27;t see why they are getting so many good reviews, I&#x27;m sure they aren&#x27;t legitimate Bill Blass products.</li>
    <li> I have used this forever. Loved it. But the ones I have ordered the last couple of times does not smell like it used to. What&#x27;s up?</li>
    <li> I ordered this perfume for my mom she loved it.It smells great &amp; I can&#x27;t argue with the price 😊</li>
    <li> i wish it was never discontinued</li>
    <li> We have a running joke at my house, when my wife asked for a bottle of this years ago she said &amp;#34;and its very hard to find they dont make it any more&amp;#34; and I went out to Pennys and found a huge display of it. Not so much anymore, so glad to find it on Amazon</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this scent by a friend back in the early 90&amp;#34;s. I am so glad that I found it again. I will be ordering more from this shipper.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this fragrance ever since. It has changed a bit but is close enough to continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;My bottle is almost empty and will be reordering soon. I don&#x27;t wear it everyday so it will last. The first time I purchased it, I found it at Dillards but after Bill Blass passed away they quit selling it which made me sad. Perfume does not smell the same on everyone. Perfumes tend to sour with my chemistry but this one smells wonderful on me and stays true to the scent. This is my forever fragrance. I always order the 3.4 ounce. The more the better.  I would order by the gallon if I could. When I wear it everyone will ask me what are you wearing, you smell so good! I love it!</li>
    <li> Spicy, delightful fragrance that makes everyone&#x27;s head turn.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cologne for more than 20 years and I love it. Everybody ask me about this great cologne.</li>
    <li> I have used Nude by Bill Blass ever since I can remember, and I have always purchased it at the mall; then they discontinued it. Soo, I was glad to see it online, and purchased it. Well, I will probably never purchase cologne sprays online again as this was a complete disappointment.</li>
    <li> Smells awesome... Great price</li>
    <li> The cologne is great however this bottle came without the nozzle that sits atop the tubing.  Fortunately I had one from a previous bottle and was able to use it.  Otherwise I would have had to go through the return process.  Huge oversight on the shippers&#x27; end.</li>
    <li> This is my signature scent , I get so many compliments from both men and women. It is soft but lasts all day. The price is excellent!!!</li>
    <li> than any other I have ever worn.I have worn a lot of different perfumes over the years, but this one is THE best one I have ever found. Actually my niece found this perfume, and I loved it so much I have bought it every chance I get.</li>
    <li> I chose Amazon.com, because it&#x27;s prices are reasonable. I love my perfume Nude. I it a beautiful smell. I get many compliments from men as well as women. I would recommend this to all my friends and family.</li>
    <li> Not really crazy about this perfume. smells kind of cheap. I would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> My long time favorite perfume. Nice price for designer Bill Blass product.</li>
    <li> I have been using since it first came out.  People always ask what I am using when I wear it.</li>
    <li> Awesome size and price</li>

    <li> Buenas, amigo pedí 3 colonias y las que llegaron fueron 2 bill blass  1 de euphoria?? pido una explicación ustedes mandaron el paquete completo o robaron en el envio</li>
    <li> NOT flowery.  Likely a dated scent, but it works on me for me.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> I got 3 of Nude bill blasts, The smell is not good, if I can return these items let me know?????</li>
    <li> This is by far the most wonderful perfume ever..&lt;br /&gt;I have never recv more compliments as I have with this one.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone says &amp;#34;what is that&amp;#34; or that smells so fresh and clean&lt;br /&gt;or etc.. It is by far my very favorite.&lt;br /&gt;Teresa Harris&lt;br /&gt;Paradise somewhere in GA.</li>
    <li> I love Nude and have worn this fragrance for years... I just started the new bottle that I got online and for some reason it doesn&#x27;t smell like the one I got at the mall.... It doesn&#x27;t seem like the real fragrance to me... I am disappointed to say the least!</li>
    <li> Favorite scent of all time.  Light not overpowering</li>
    <li> Love this perfume.  I have been using it for years!  My mom likes it, too, so I bought her one.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume and I love it when my wife wears it.  Lovely scent without being too overpowerful either.</li>
    <li> I have tried before! Loved it, very fresh scent; I received many very good compliments about my new fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a perfum lover, so I have several different ones from very good brands.&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend Nude!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rose Rosa</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance and get compliments all the time.  It hasn&#x27;t been sold in department stores since I cannot remember when.  Amazon is my go-to for this fragrance.  If you do not love fruity, floral, OVER the top smells, then this one&#x27;s for you!!!</li>
    <li> My favorite fragrance of all time......I always get compliments on how good I smell. Love it!!!!!</li>
    <li> love it !&lt;br /&gt;this has been one of my favorite perfumes for a long time and is hard to find and the price........you can&#x27;t beat it&lt;br /&gt;it smells just like I remember</li>

    <li> I got just what I ordered love it.</li>
    <li> I search high and low for the cologne, absolutely love it.  I get so many compliments when I wear this, it has a clean smell.</li>
    <li> My all time favorite perfume!</li>
    <li> Wife loves this stuff and I think it smells pretty good on her plus you can&#x27;t beat the price over the high end brands.</li>
    <li> THE ITEM WAS EVERYTHING IT WAS EXPECTED TO BE. VERY HAPPY WITH THE ITEM. WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO FAMILY AND FRIENDS</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume. I finished my last bottle last year and I was looking for it on every store... till I saw it on Amazon!! What a nice buy, this is my second order. It was carefully packed and delivered on time. I would definitely buy again from this seller.</li>
    <li> just love this scent..</li>
    <li> I am using &amp;#34;Nude&amp;#34; by Bill Blass only for more than 25 years.  JCPenny used to sell it now it is hard to find and I am so glad to get it on Amazon.  Item I purhased is milde than the perfume scent but it is worth the price.  It is a soft fragrance cologne, wear it once and it lingers on.  I will buy it again and again.  Usually, men will ask what are you wearing?  It is embarassing to say that I am wearing nude.</li>
    <li> The packaging was different from original. Perfume has very similar smell, but with strong alcohol scent. Golden coloring on the bottle itself came off after couple uses.</li>
    <li> Used to wear this years ago. I didn&#x27;t even know they made it anymore. Still the same light, not too sweet, yet very feminine. It lasts a long time without being over powering.</li>
    <li> I been in love with this perfume all my life. Every time I wear it I get complement . Women love it ,man love it . It small awesome ! If could give it more stars I would</li>
    <li> One of my favorite fragrances and the price is right !!!</li>
    <li> Great to find an oldie but goodie! My wife is thrilled</li>
    <li> I am still glad you had this Amazon still.  It especially stays with you in the summer time.  Thank you for having it.</li>
    <li> Love this one!!, a great scent, I get lots of compliments. Its another blast from the past for me and I&#x27;m so glad I found it on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I can wear this everyday to work or to a social event.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was prompt and no damages on the product.</li>
    <li> Be warned---Amazon will not accept this as a return because it is a &#x27;flammable item.&amp;#34; I did not know this at the time or I would not would have chanced it. I just missed this perfume so much that I was willing to give it a chance, and I saw that a trusted name such as Amazon is selling it, then surely it would be authentic.&lt;br /&gt;I used to wear this purfume throughout the 90s so I remember well how it would smell first sprayed, and how it would wear all day, and the notes of the perfume were very sophisticated---not like what this item is. This appears to be a fake (especially since this item may be discontinued) because it has a cheapness about it, and smells stronger of alchohol than the original, and when this dries down on the skin, it doesn&#x27;t smell like the perfume that I remember---kinda more like a cheap &amp;#34;powder&amp;#34; smell, compared to the real thing.</li>
    <li> I have used Nude by Bill Blass for years. I took a break, and now back again. I get lots of complements. I thought it was eau de toilet though.</li>
    <li> Beautiful sophicated romantic scent.&lt;br /&gt;I always get compliments!  A little goes a long way and the scent lasts all day.</li>
    <li> It not expensive and it smells very good and it stays on you for a long time.  People will ask you; What are you wearing? because it smells good.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a long time. This smells soooooo gooood!</li>
    <li> The last time I ordered this product  it waa Great ,  I  got complaints every time I wore it  ..&lt;br /&gt;this time it smells awful.</li>
    <li> This is my one and only perfume! The best</li>
    <li> Good gift for an older woman. The smell is not to strong</li>
    <li> I tried to purchase this product from the different sellers. All of them deliver the bottle in the open box. It does not like an original Blass product...</li>
</ol>
