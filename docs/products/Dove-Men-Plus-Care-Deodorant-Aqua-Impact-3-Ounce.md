      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Glad I made the purchase!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d  never trust that kind of junk on labeling anyways.(just</li>
      <li>Smells nice and design is sleek.</li>
      <li>Love the scent on this as well, as it enables me to wear good cologne and not have a deodorant smell overpowering it.</li>
      <li>great price quick delivery</li>
      <li>Excellent product for people with sensitive arm pits.  </li>
      <li>more choices.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Just will not recommend it because there are way better deodorants in this price range.</li>
      <li>I love this product but will not pay $5 at cvs or grocery store.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Original review:&lt;br /&gt;I found myself reapplying this at times, most days I reapplied it once.  </li>
      <li>This has a pleasant smell and is reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>Biggest bonus is the Dove for Men deodorants are all really great with my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Great deodorant for a reasonable price that protects all day long and smells really nice!  </li>
      <li>Specifically this sentence from the paragraph below \\&quot;This irritant property of PG is particularly relevant to antiperspirants and deodorants, where long-term occlusion in the underarm area may contribute to the induction of irritant</li>
      <li>This irritant property of PG is particularly relevant to antiperspirants and deodorants, where long-term occlusion in the underarm area may contribute to the induction of irritant dermatitis.</li>
      <li>They claim 48 hours of protection but 24 sounds a bit more reasonable.</li>
      <li>Loved the scent but it didn&#x27;t last at all.</li>
      <li>This was the best scent I could find in Dove, but my wife has told me several times she doesn&#x27;t like the smell as much as the Arctic Force Old Spice she is used to...</li>
      <li>Great scent, not too heavy.  </li>
      <li>If anybody know of other good ones please let me know,</li>
      <li>in fact she seems to like every Old Spice scent I have used (Fresh, and Pure Sport also) better than this scent of Dove.</li>
      <li>To verify positive patch-test results, Funk et al suggest repeated patch test with serial dilutions, biopsies of affected skin, and oral challenge tests, but these methods are rarely used in the clinical setting.</li>
      <li>I have tried lots of different deodorants and this is the first one I&#x27;m able to use long-term.  </li>
      <li>Can deodorant really get 5 stars?)</li>
      <li>At 14%, it won&#x27;t do much.  </li>
      <li>It is not over powering scent, like Axe which is too much for preteen.</li>
      <li>It also stays smelling good all day long and is quite dry too.</li>
      <li>This large variability may be due to the fact that PG is a strong irritant (the Material Safety Data Sheet advises avoidance at concentrations over 50 percent); therefore, patch testing may yield false-positive reactions.</li>
      <li>so I bit the bullet and tried out a new brand.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t have the aluminum that anti-antiperspirants have, but doesn&#x27;t have the performance I was used to with Old Spice High Endurance...</li>
      <li>Currently, the NACDG uses 30 percent PG in water for patch testing, a concentration that has significant potential for skin irritation.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like paying a lot for deodorant, but the cheap stuff sometimes smells odd.</li>
      <li>The NACDG found that 4.2 percent of patients referred for patch testing have a positive patch test to PG, but other studies have reported an incidence of positive reactions ranging from 0.1 to 3.8 percent.</li>
      <li>Natural one did not work for our son, so gave this try.  </li>
      <li>this has all the same ingredients as Old Spice, but feels very watered down in comparison, and I get less odor protection even when I use more.  </li>
      <li>Keeps me dry the whole day.  </li>
      <li>Can anyone tell me if it&#x27;s clear or white stick?</li>
      <li>This relatively low concentration may be below the elicitation threshold for some patients with PG allergy, but since it is difficult, if not impossible, to prospectively identify PG allergic patients who will tolerate PG-containing products and because their elicitation threshold may change over time, it is prudent to recommend that all patients with a positive patch test to PG avoid antiperspirants and deodorants containing this allergen.\\&quot;</li>
      <li>Some brands are not strong enough, but these keep me fresh and dry all day.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The fragrance of the deodorant is very good.  It also stays smelling good all day long and is quite dry too.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t have the aluminum that anti-antiperspirants have, but doesn&#x27;t have the performance I was used to with Old Spice High Endurance... this has all the same ingredients as Old Spice, but feels very watered down in comparison, and I get less odor protection even when I use more.  This was the best scent I could find in Dove, but my wife has told me several times she doesn&#x27;t like the smell as much as the Arctic Force Old Spice she is used to... in fact she seems to like every Old Spice scent I have used (Fresh, and Pure Sport also) better than this scent of Dove.</li>
    <li> Great scent, not too heavy.  Keeps me dry the whole day.  Some brands are not strong enough, but these keep me fresh and dry all day.</li>
    <li> Not a mans product. It&#x27;s deodorant and not antiperspirant. Men want both. I think Women do too. Why does anyone market a product that is just a deodorant?</li>
    <li> I have switched, however, to the antiperspirant Aqua Impact, which I prefer to the deodorant. Unlike other antiperspirants, I don&#x27;t get irritation. Love the scent on this as well, as it enables me to wear good cologne and not have a deodorant smell overpowering it. Well done, Dove.</li>
    <li> I love this product but will not pay $5 at cvs or grocery store. Smells nice and design is sleek. Scent could be a bit stronger</li>
    <li> It smells good and doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation.  They claim 48 hours of protection but 24 sounds a bit more reasonable.</li>
    <li> 3 stars because this is very overpriced product that is definitely not better then other leading brands for same or even lower price. Product itself works for about 3-4 hours. Just will not recommend it because there are way better deodorants in this price range.</li>
    <li> Natural one did not work for our son, so gave this try.  It is not over powering scent, like Axe which is too much for preteen.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for people with sensitive arm pits.  I have tried lots of different deodorants and this is the first one I&#x27;m able to use long-term.  If anybody know of other good ones please let me know, that way I got more choices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5/8/2014- I&#x27;ve been using this for years but lately I have been seeing some irritation in my arm pits while using it. Now I&#x27;m alternating AVON roll-on deodorant and this every week. The AVON roll-ons have never given me any irritation</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like paying a lot for deodorant, but the cheap stuff sometimes smells odd. This has a pleasant smell and is reasonably priced. Good buy. (I supposed I&#x27;d give it 5 stars, but it&#x27;s just deodorant. Can deodorant really get 5 stars?)</li>
    <li> Loved the scent but it didn&#x27;t last at all. Worst performance of the 3 I tried (Fresh, Silver and Aqua). Biggest bonus is the Dove for Men deodorants are all really great with my sensitive skin. Never had any hint of an issue with any of these.</li>
    <li> Great product for a great price. We put this on subscribe and save and it was cheaper than buying at our local store with no difference in quality. Love it!</li>
    <li> great product at a great economical price</li>
    <li> Edit:  I found that if I did need to reapply this, washing over the area with a wet towel, drying, and then reapplying it seemed to help the problem I had as it was fairly minor irritation(still switched to another deodorant since it didn&#x27;t fully fix it).  Still, just in case, I suggest whenever switching deodorants to watch for rashes or irritation, as I did have a worse experience with another brand before this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also wouldn&#x27;t expect it to last 24 hours, let alone 48.  I&#x27;d  never trust that kind of junk on labeling anyways.(just a little note)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review:&lt;br /&gt;I found myself reapplying this at times, most days I reapplied it once.  After a couple weeks(today) I noticed skin irritation and a bit of peeling skin around the irritated area.  I have a feeling it could be in part do to multiple applications, but if it doesn&#x27;t end up lasting like it should what is one to do?  Anyways I did some research into propylene glycol(mostly in gel deodorants it seems) and found this article listed below which I think explains some of the problem.  Specifically this sentence from the paragraph below \\&quot;This irritant property of PG is particularly relevant to antiperspirants and deodorants, where long-term occlusion in the underarm area may contribute to the induction of irritant dermatitis.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Link: [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Propylene glycol, a solvent with moisturizing, antiseptic, and preservative properties, was the second most commonly present allergen and was present in 47 percent of the deodorants contained in the Walgreens database. It is used in a wide range of products, including cosmetics, food, toothpaste, and mouthwash, and functions in deodorants to stabilize the aqueous phase of the product. There is some controversy surrounding the allergic potential of PG. The NACDG found that 4.2 percent of patients referred for patch testing have a positive patch test to PG, but other studies have reported an incidence of positive reactions ranging from 0.1 to 3.8 percent. This large variability may be due to the fact that PG is a strong irritant (the Material Safety Data Sheet advises avoidance at concentrations over 50 percent); therefore, patch testing may yield false-positive reactions. This irritant property of PG is particularly relevant to antiperspirants and deodorants, where long-term occlusion in the underarm area may contribute to the induction of irritant dermatitis. Currently, the NACDG uses 30 percent PG in water for patch testing, a concentration that has significant potential for skin irritation. At times, this irritation may be misinterpreted as contact dermatitis, leading to questionable data regarding true allergic potential of the product. To verify positive patch-test results, Funk et al suggest repeated patch test with serial dilutions, biopsies of affected skin, and oral challenge tests, but these methods are rarely used in the clinical setting.

    <li> Great deodorant for a reasonable price that protects all day long and smells really nice!  Glad I made the purchase!</li>
    <li> It lasts for about 3 hours.  Then, doing nothing but sitting there, you start to smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notice my name, how it says \\&quot;See all my reviews?\\&quot;  Now look at all the 5 star reviews gushing about this product.  Notice that&#x27;s their only review, as if the only product they ever wanted to review was deodorant?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ignore the fake reviews, this stuff is terrible.  It doesn&#x27;t work.  Every other deodorant I&#x27;ve ever tried has worked.  The reason is the active ingredient is too weak.  At 14%, it won&#x27;t do much.  Arm and Hammer has 19% of the same stuff.  Save your money on this worthless product.</li>
    <li> I despise finding deodorant streaks all on my black shirts, so I looked for an invisible solid (also do not like goop) and this was on sale so I bit the bullet and tried out a new brand. It&#x27;s nice! The deodorant doesn&#x27;t irritate, and it&#x27;s also an anti-antiperspirant so not only does it cut down on the actual sweating, but I don&#x27;t smell funky after a hard day&#x27;s work. Another plus is that it doesn&#x27;t feel caked on the way that some solids do, and the key feature: no streaks !!</li>
    <li> Can anyone tell me if it&#x27;s clear or white stick?</li>
    <li> great price quick delivery</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m trying to find out if it was a mistake or this is a misleading publicity... I read Dove men + care deodorant.... blablabla and 2 deodorant in the picture... the plus sing and 2 deodorant sends a wrong message, I thought I will be receiving a pair of deodorants.  However this rate does not reflect the quality of this product which I&#x27;m not intended because I have not tested yet.</li>
